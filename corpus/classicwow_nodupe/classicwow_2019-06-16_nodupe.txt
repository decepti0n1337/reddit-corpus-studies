its not the catform abilities that matter, its the auto-attack speed.  
---

---
Majority of feral damage at low levels is from auto-attacks anyway so having a fast attack speed is crucial for efficient dps considering you wont be hitcapped and many of your hits will be parried/dodged so the faster you hit the less likely you will end up waiting for several seconds before gaining  enough rage to use maul.  
---
Since catform doesnt use rage but rather  focus you dont need to deal damage or take damage to be able to use claw.

---
Been debating between a warrior and a warlock
---
The difficulty of a fight like Thaddius isn't solely in the mechanics. Sure, all you do is run in a circle. But you're playing with 40 people, and if one person messes up, the raid wipes.
---
Thanks a heap for the update I like the one form Kurthos as it also gives you more options than 1
---
The eastern kingdoms.
---
Yeah i am on the highest populated server it's so populated and alot of life on it
---
It’s very strange, because some instant spells like repentance DO reset the swing timer. (At least on pservers) Also procced instant attacks/heals with hand of Edward the odd reset the swing timer. So it seems some spells are coded to always ignore swing timer.
---
I’m just joshing buddy. What I wrote is what I get on my client too.
---
If it's showing up to you, you are *probably* going to be invited to the stress test this week.  It shows up for me a few days before I got the last stress test email.
---
Think so? I did a great deal of kill-trading on private servers, (even though it was against the rules.) Does Blizzard have a stance on kill trading?
---
I don't really understand how combat reach would increase the ranged minimum range...
---
Regardless of the dead zone numbers, as I explained, melee leeway conceptually is in the advantage of the melee attacker and not neutral to the hunter.
---
Whether or not that system should be in place or what the actual numbers should be or were I make no comment on.
---
just read mmo champion..

Locks are top dps in late Naxx.

---
It's not about you wanting to play better, it's when that mentality is forced on others. Like when people ask about non-meta specs or even playing Paladin in general you get the general smattering of "lol enjoy not gettting invited to raids".
---
Not that I recall - saw plenty of it in bfa.
---
Yes, you can heal any instance as long as you have healing gear, with int, +sp or +healing.
---
Might get tougher in UBRS, but still doable.

---
The point of my comment is saying that there is no objective winner and writers can make anything up, therefore it's pointless arguing who would win.
---
honestly theyre not thaaat bad if you have the right hairstyle they look fine and if anything theyre just proportionally plump midgets
---
Didn't include that they fucking front flip and dumb dwarves don't... must not be a vanilla player :)
---
Oh shit it's Lokth, I saw your on Madseason's stream a few days ago.
---
I still have trouble with it in retail cause there's 3d models all over the ground now. Getting stuck inside random terrain and stuff like barrels ain't fun.
---
Holy shit I played dspine from early early bc to wod!
---
Get 1 main lvl 60, rest of your chars minimum 35alts with all the long cooldown prof skills, do the daily prof shuffle and get rich
---
maul may deal more damage but have you considered that using maul requires rage? and since bearform attack-speed is slower you will not be gaining alot of rage consistently, and make sure to remember the fact that you wont be hitcapped so youll be getting parried/dodged/missed alot so using maul might just end up doing no damage because of it.  
---
In catform you attack faster, focus auto-generates and hitcap is less impactful due to the wait time between attacks and resource requirements of your abilities. And if you are in catform all the time you will have full focus bar unlike in bearform you almost always start at 0 rage when you enter combat.   
---
So i think thats the argument why catform is better for leveling.
---
Both judgement and HoJ don’t reset swing timer.

You're absolutely incorrect and spreading blatant misinformation.
---
In 1.12 holy paladins are insanely broken and are absolute power houses.  
---
Shamans, priests and paladins all rezz, being able to stay out of combat and ress people that died isn't in 1.12.  Regarding buffs, pallypower and greater blessings make it negligible, that absolute hardest part of paladin blessings in raids is making prot warriors get an addon that auto removes salvation.
---
Basically if you're interested in rolling a holy paladin and this guy put you off, they can do absolutely insane shit and have one of the most broken tool sets in vanilla.
---
It’s a guild created by myself and friends with a good amount of recruits we’ve picked up. I’m not trying to complain about the system, I like it a lot. Rather, I’m trying to find ways to fix the flaws I see in the system to round it out more. There is still a good amount of time left before launch so I’d rather go through any changes now before we get into the thick of things.

Work is the poop.  No more!

Wish i still had one of the three copies i bought when i was a kid, i had no idea what value was back then 😓

its going to be too easy compare to private servers, values or whatever, still looking into this
---
Is this a multiboxer?
---
Not to put on a tin foil hat or anything but this is the same Blizzard "You think you do but you don't" and are maybe trying to fudge classic? Probably not but how are ALL private servers wrong when "also we lost the original code until Omar locked himself away for 2 weeks to bring it back"?
---
That we won’t get an Oceanic server.
---
Do you even need to kite in BfA
---
Did you guys play on Shattered Hand? The name Kateness sounds very familiar.
---
You cannot cast Shadowmeld while in Steal or Prowl or visa versa since they break each other. Plus it contradicts the tooltip:   
---
&gt; Night Elf Rogues and Druids with Shadowmeld are more difficult to detect while stealthed or prowling.     
---
It also contradicts this spell found on Vanilla DB and other vanilla sites:   
---
https://vanillawowdb.com/?spell=21009

We know that "(6) Apply Aura: Unknown Aura (154)" elsewhere is equivelent to "Increases your effective stealth level by 1."

Thanks for the quick answers ^^

From level 28 to 60 - turtles. TURTLESSSSS

We skip on Fire Ward, at least.

Paladin: abysmal leveling speed and solo content clearing. 
---
And the gameplay is wuite lineair but that is subjectibe :)
---
&gt; Honestly, I don't really like bongos (vanilla version)'s lack of easy keybinding, but it's a lot better than nothing. Back when I played wrath, I remember by that time there were mods out where you could just turn on a mode, hover over an action button on the bar, and press a key, and it would bind that button to that key. I miss those days.
---
I'm fairly certain I did this exact thing on a 1.12 pserver. Not sure if it was Bartender or something else.
---
Yeah! Turtles in Shimmering flats and the lordaeron lake are good for money!
---
Nice! I played horde. Talha was my character, and I had a guild called &lt;WTF is PVE&gt; in TBC/Wrath. Only played a little bit through most other expansions past cata... Server community died sadly
---
It's objectively right. Blizzard themselves said they changed it because it had extremely low participation. You monkeys can keep pretending everyone loved old AV though.
---
Shaman: needs 4 bag slots for totems, just to be able to use all your abilities
---
Warrior: very gear dependent. Needs to be carried.
---
most people will be stuck on regular mounts anyway in classic. :P 
---
it wont be nearly as easy  for casuals to farm several hundred gold for it.
---
This crater is a place old elephants go to die, since the Grass that grows there is much softer and easier för them to eat at and old age when their teeth are worn.
---
Might be confusion it with another place, im fairly sure its this one though.

yep I was Sadisticc the female troll rogue in No Contest.
---
wtf small world
---
Druid: very hard to play properly in pvp? No idea druid is a well balanced class.
---
You must role need need on all leather gear before 40 and all mail gear after 40, no exceptions (unless you already have the item).  Because all gear is hunter gear.  Agility and strength shoulderpads?  *Perfect* for your hunter.  Intellect and Spirit staff?  *Perfect* for your hunter.
---
haha that's fair, you got a discord?
---
I have a 27 druid on beta and thought bear was awfull at 20. Yes it suck that cat don't get a good finisher but i didn't find myself almost dead/eating after 2 pull compare to bear. 
---
I tried different pulling/killing technic and so far praying the rng god for crit in cat form seem to be better.
---
I'm new to druid but not to wow. But deffinitevely still haven't put my finger on druid ease of leveling I've heard.
---
Might just not be my class after all.
---
Lol the quality is supreme

They've never ended a beta before launch.  Every (sans retail) beta lasts 3-7 days past launch.

**Jaded | Horde | NA-PVP |**
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
**ENGLISH ONLY**
---
**Looking to Fill Class Officer/Raid Leader**
---
Information:
---
We are a layered Guild
---
**Community:** Everyone outside of the guild that has joined The Horde (4 guilds, 100+ members total, multi-guild alliance) and has interaction access to our guild, and vice versa!
---
**Casual:** Requirements: None, plays for fun
---
**RT: Sat/Sun 8-10 PM CST** (If we get enough for a 40 man raid team)
---
**Casual+:** Casuals who want to apply themselves to the guild by way of farming resources, maxing out a profession etc
---
**Progression/Semi Hardcore:** Requirements: Wants to raid, and applies themselves to farming/BiS grind to a progression extent, and understands that this is not BFA.
---
*RT: Wednesday, 6-8 PM CST* ***(Until AQ, then Longer/more days)***
---
**Hardcore:** Requirements: Players who want BiS, apply themselves more than any other and want a fast paced Raid Team
---
*(Combining hardcore with progression until we get enough to make just a Hardcore Raid Team to accommodate a Faster Pace and Higher Intellect)*
---
**PVP: Duh**
---
**Hardcore PVP:** Requirements: People who strive for rank 14, and join the BG Team
---
*\_\_QT: Every Day, 2 hours minimum\_\_*
---
**There will be no rules/restrictions, freedom of speech/actions, no bullshit, just community, No FUCKING snowflakes**
---
Because it's layered, players who find themselves changed don't have to leave the guild to join a guild that is their new playstyle because we cater to all playstyles, and because we are apart of The Horde, should their raid times change they don't have to leave their friends, they just join a different Horde, and stay in the same community.
---
Ask me questions with a **PM on discord**.  We play a private server for practice
---

Yes, just park them in a rested area while you're leveling your main. Rested bonus caps at 10 days.
---
So, this content is 15 year old, we get 1.12 patch skills and itemization, everything gets cleared even without world buffs within a few hours anyway.
---
So, the World buffs will hurt? Ok mate.
---
A lot of it had to do with the terrain though rather than the spells, right?
---
Aspect of the cheetah.
---
Its WoW classic not WoW alternate universe.
---
Thanks for posting this. This is a topic that is not getting the attention it needs! Keep it up.
---
They are subjectively _higher quality_ models.
---
Otherwise I agree and I love your way of looking at it.
---
Stealth levels aren't the same as character levels. It requires 5 stealth levels to be equal to a character level. All 5 points in MoD as a level 60 rogue make you level 61 as far as stealth is concerned.
---
And no joke the turtles on the east coast of the Hinterlands used to be a horde leveling-grinding spot in Vanilla.  I think they were neutral so no worry about aggroing too many, dropped cooking mats, on the coast so various types of herbs nearby, skinnable and dropped scales (used for leatherworking).  And it was right near a horde town for selling junk and retreating to if the alliance came around.
---
Look at Sodapop. He acts like an idiot and gets tons of viewers.
---
If memeory serves, dwarf mages were a thing in beta, but were removed before launch.  I belive this was  to balance the number of race/class combinations between factions.
---
Personally, I would never consider playing on a PvE server given the choice.  Your husband wont regret playing PvP if he enjoyed it in the past.
---
One thing I miss playing retail is making BIS lists! Gear progression is at the heart of RPGS and I can't wait to get the best gear I can for my toons
---
There are neutral turtles from 28 to 55. Turtles are the key to success.
---
Everybody is Chicken Little these days.
---
Late TBC, right?

I disagree completely.  Cross realm BG’s were a fantastic and needed change and have nothing to do with other cross realm features that have proven to be shitty.  
---
Super happy they’ll be in place for Classic.
---
I appreciate it, thank you!
---
Yeah I don't plan on being shadow at high level, this is just purely a levelling question, so long as I can heal 5-mans while being majority shadow while levelling that's all I want
---
Not even a glyph anymore. Glyphs are purely cosmetic now. Blink is like the only spell that requires you to see a trainer for. It's a binary on/off st mage trainers.
---
Awesome, thanks
---
Retail models look so polished that they lost their charm, indeed.
---
ah righto 1.12 had 30 min buffs and no rezzing mid fight. i do not know what was added and removed at what specific patch, only that at one point buffs were 5 mins and raid teams did have people out of combat and rezzing. i know at one point there holy/prot talent build was basically invincible in pvp whether that was worth a slot in raiding idk, i played horde.
---
Pretty sure I did it all the way into BC but maybe my memory is bad
---
If you're on a PvP server though, Sheep, blink, mount, run and you'll be gone.
---
I don't think this is true.   Make a night elf rogue and gnome rogue on a pserver, then attempt to kite mobs.  You won't be able to kite as well on a night elf rogue.   However, enemy players won't be able to kite you as easily.
---
&gt; World buffs should be removed when zoning into a raid instance.
---
Nope.
---
This isn’t indicative of how AV will be.
---
I was in a match with Towelliee earlier yesterday and he was having the main group pull back before getting too far, artificially creating this situation rather than actually try and beat the match. After 2 hours, and realizing they weren’t ever going to go for the win, I left. 
---
All my other matches have been 90 minutes or less.
---
I also played horde. I can't remember what my mages name was back then. I also don't remember the guild I was in. Was a friend's guild that did 25 mans every week but can't think of the name 
---
Ya that server died out hard. I have a couple characters still there but I server xferred like 6 of mine and 3 of my friends character to tichondrius at the start of wod.
---
I had no idea! I just stumbled on this randomly
---
Gnomes are OK I guess but the real deal and hero of Alliance are dwarf. They are cooler and better than the rest and make short work of ugly orc LOL
---
And every raid is happy to have 7. So there is always a guild that will need a Mage.
---
Oh yeah! Between the waterfall and the horse town with the roaming quest mob. Also where the treasure map quest ends and a bunch of alcohol for a booty bay quest leads!
---
&gt;  It requires 5 stealth levels to be equal to a character level.    
---
Did you not read the multiple links? That's exactly what it grants.    
---
&gt; (6) Apply Aura: Unknown Aura (154)    
---
&gt; Value: 5    
---
If you search for "(6) Apply Aura: Unknown Aura (154)" there's a developer test spell literally called "Increases your effective stealth level by 1" that also grants 5 stealth levels.    
---
I really couldn't have spoon fed this harder.
---
You dont have any CDs to macro together.
---
Grave moss in RFD, you can stealth it and pickpocket the mobs on pservers at least and hit like 4-5 nodes, I was able to sell them for a decent amount back when the server was fresh
---
Is this a jebait?
---
Typically, only one Mage goes Winter's Chill, and no one wants to be the one who has to spec Winter's Chill. You basically become the bitch Mage and will be lower DPS than the rest skill levels equal considering, thus if your loot council factors in performance, naturally puts you below the other Mage's for loot.
---
I tried playing a gnome for a bit... but I always hated how if they don't have facial hair, they dont get eyebrows. What's up with that?
---
That'd be great if Shadowmeld did this while stealthed, but it does not.
---
And Aimed Shot!
---
They said so you can uninstall it easier.
---
pretty sure most/ all of them were for alliance... wonder what does that mean lul
---
Another disagree, guy.  I don't know if you're the type to stealth before every kill, but if so, stop.  Cat at 20 has +15% outdoor speed and you just run up and spam Claw, loot, pop out and cast a HoT whenever it's needed, then cat form and run up and spam Claw on the next mob.  Fast af leveling.
---
Gonna agree with this, as someone in the beta.
---
I'd much rather continue to practice leveling routes than to play AV.
---
Non faction minded people can be horde too. There's that undead guy alone on the island, He's isnt part of the Horde and he's in Tirsfal. And theres Argent Dawn there aswell. Also non-faction minded people.
---
You have created a fictional zone which is along the coast, the least of the problems would be to fill it with people. Any people.
---
He’s not wrong. The streamers I’ve seen are artificially creating these situations and not going for the win. 
---
This happened twice, in matches I’ve had without streamers, there wasn’t really much fighting. Both sides ran by each other on the way to the bases, all the skirmishing took place at the base GYs by a small group of defenders. Basically first team to cap the GY won. Every other match was less than 80 minutes of I had to guess.
---
I believe I was using bartender during wrath, and I remember liking it a lot at the time. 
---
I tried bartender for the vanilla clients floating around, but I had an issue with it that I now forget, and when I went to the addon forums about it, everyone was just saying "bartender is terrible, use bongos instead". And since I hate configuring addons in general, I gave up on bartender.
---
Sorry to say, but you’re wrong. All races have same reach/ hitbox except for tauren. Who have a bigger hitbox and bigger reach.
---
What a moronic video. Its just based on the stupid straw man argument that one other unrelated thing have been changed therefore this change i valid.
---
omg the troll ears... why
---
"COME LOOK AT THIS" 😂😂😂 God, I love it.
---
This sub has been pretty toxic and divisive 
---
I only browse it when other subs are dead and I regret it constantly. I can’t wait to kill some of these people in game
---
On lb you didn't get honor for killing elites. We ran 6min games as ally. Rogues rushed in front. Didn't even kill warmasters, just had 1 tank tank them outside while the rest killed drek. Av is pve tbh.
---
... I mean you were quite justified in doing those things, but I need to ask, the hell kind of mental gymnastics does a hunter have for wanting something with spell crit?
---
On a wotlk pserver that just came out that statistic made the imbalance way worse. Was like 55/45 horde. After about 2 days it was 70/30 horde. They removed the stat and had to offer free character xfers and some other bonus to get the ratio back to around 60/40-55/45 or so. 
---
Pvp wise it was fun for ally. Instant queues. But id much rather be on the bigger side for Pve. 
---
People see a slight imbalance and worry about the smaller faction dying out in the future. So they roll on the bigger one. Then it just gets worse and worse.
---
Excellent suggestion!
---
Give us the option just as Classic is the option to Retail.
---
so y didnt they take rogue?  allies got 4 rogues, the only other class with 4 besides warriors that both factions get
---
Dual wield!
---
Yeah it definitely looks much cooler in vanilla. It's more like you're gliding over the ground as opposed to tippy-toeing to be sneaky.
---
Is this compatible with Questie? Thanks!
---
I don't care which one it is. Neither look terrible. The classic one does however look really unrealistic, the newer version looks more realistic. To move that fast his feet need to move like that haha. Either way they end up having it is fine by me though, this will not stop me from being a rogue.
---
&gt; if he have a lot HP and deal a lot of damage
---
Yes, but 8 debuffs and/or old itemization don't make big difference. Didn't make big difference on private servers and I think wouldn't make it on Classic.
---
Except there are people in the beta that have checked it and it's been confirmed since forever that the deadzone is further out and fucks over any tauren hunters.
---
I'm not even going to bother explaining it to you since I've already done so twice in this thread.
---
I just showed you mechanically that's exactly what it does, it is a constant passive with no modifiers. You're now arguing that they put a passive that applies "Mod Stealth Effectiveness" (Aura 154) by +5, which only works when not stealthed... So they added a passive which literally does nothing at all... According to you...
---
I thought you could queue for av at 58 in vanilla also.  Been a bit, so OFC, I could be wrong.
---
Yeah, I've heard that the Hand of Justice trinket\* resets the timer the same way, which makes more sense when thinking of it like an instant spell effect.
---
^(\*Normally it wouldn't even be possible to notice that Hand of Justice resets the swing timer since it's an on-hit effect, but Judgement can (allegedly) trigger on-hit effects like other classes' instant-speed attacks, so that could cause you to reset your timer if you triggered it in the middle of your swing cycle. I've also heard that the triggered attack is always the main-hand weapon so that could screw with your swing timer for classes that dual-wield and trigger the effect with their off-hand.)
---
Oh god the demo one looks awful. He's walking like he needs to take a shit and can barely hold it in.
---
No one gives a shit what a guy who goes by 'mallninja69' says
---
One of the most annoying classic things ever is when somebody struggles to find "advantages" and sugarcoats the choice when all the maths are against it.
---
Just admit that you like nelf rogues the most and you will play as one. It's not that hard and unlike the first kind of argumentation it is valid.
---
Melee leeway would be one of those things that are entirely server sided, meaning private servers absolutely cannot be used as comparison.
---
Are trying to tell this guy that his opinion on what is fun, is wrong?
---
If such simple change (that private servers are capable of implementing btw) creates a lot of bugs, then Blizzard devs are less competent than a schoolboy.
---
You know what also makes for a different experience? Having 1.12 from day 1.
---
I'm just putting this out there because I'm nearly 100% sure this is how they will handle it. If they do Retro servers, each one will be a museum all to itself. And they will dead the idea of xferring gold and wealth to the new server completely by letting everyone know you have to start from 1.
---
And it will still be packed.... Because the people that skip vanilla, but decide to play TBC will love the idea of not being "behind".
---
&gt; pservers
---
Yea pservers are 100% true to Vanilla.
---
[laughs in warlock pet "bug"]
---
Cat
---
What if I told you that's the troll bommkin form? Gratz dude that's dope
---
The problem is that the ones that chose not to care still need the minmaxers.
---
It would be easy to say; make a raid with only minmaxers and one with only I-do-whatever-players and lets all have fun. 
---
The problem is that the second raid will only have fun untill they realise the only way for that mentality to get you t3 is if your guild has enough minmaxers which is hard to accomplish for 2 reasons :
---
1. What's in it for the minmaxers to pick someone who doesn't care to contribute to the team effort the way they are?
---
2. Going all-shits-and-giggles is much less fun in a guild where everyone clearly outperforms you enormously all the time (by playing the same class, but optimally)
---
Frankly I used to be a minmaxer because I like doing things while checking all the boxes. Doing it right is not some unachievable goal to aspire. You can make a list with gear, buffs, rotation and when you can check off everything : voila, perfection achieved.
---
I don't know if I will have the time this time, but that doesn't mean I demand others to play differently now too so I'd feel less behind...
---
It has been agreed that you cannot test anything on pservers and come to the conclusion, "See, it's how it was on vanilla!" Pservers are riddled with errors and problems that have now all been accepted as "Vanilla." People are quickly learning that pservers got it wrong in many places.
---
Nothing like hearing a gnome warrior say " I'm all out of rage!"
---
It's gonna be fuckin huge, and population is gonna grow for like a year straight.  People just either don't know, or don't remember how dope of a game it is.  Once somebody gives it a try they gonna get sucked into the vortex.  
---
It's gonna surpass retail, and Blizz gonna have to make Classic WoW 2:  Return of classic wow...again.
---
There are also plenty of other examples showing the same thing. We've all experienced differences in range. I have no idea why you'd  want to be a melee class and have some invisible extension on your attacks to make them ranged. That makes no sense at all.
---
I'm on board with this, world buffs are aids
---
Thank you. I wrote this this morning and was quite tired. Sorry.
---
It will still fail if there's a bump or something in the way, but it won't drop you through the world.

UBRS, WoW beta, The Beast.  Dwarf mage at about 1 minute 24.
---
Because private servers don't have access to the original source code. All of the private servers being run today are _emulating_ the server code. This means that everything is a guess based on whatever publicly available information exists about how they did it. Blizzard may or may not have an original, complete version of the original client, but I imagine they are much more able to piece together one that is far closer to the original than any private server ever will because they have access to whatever backups they made, plus can go speak _directly_ to the original coders(Omar is one of those isn't he?) about how they accomplished certain things.
---
"at any level"
---
I've seen blizz massacre my boy (hunter class) a few too many times over the years to trust them.
---
Yeah you're just flat out wrong

*OwO has died*
---
Actually guys you are all wrong, Patchnotes are also wrong so i dont blame you. Here is the proof: Shurik's PVP Video from 2005-05-17 (its legendary and you can also watch it on warcraftmovies if you dont trust youtube and want to pay for premium ofc.)
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiEdH1Qsg44 If you go to the 1:00 Minute Mark he is fighting a Hunter losing its target, autoselects his pet, reselects the Hunter and has his FULL Combopoints. That is how it actually was after the 1.40 Patch
---
Here is also a noob video recorded 2005/10/08
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii1bfARVFfk
---
At the 6:00 Minute mark the Rogue gets feared/loses target. Accidentally selects a different Target and then switches back to his original Target with also having his FULL CP. 
---
So If Blizzard implements shit with losing CP hower its not authentic. Feel free to share.
---
__It’s EA behind Blizzard. You know they will force the issue at some point. Esp. if it’s popular.__
---
Remember when ~~layering~~sharding was only for the starter zones? Yeah that didn't last long.
---
The only way layering is gone in a few weeks is if the population plummets as Blizzard expects it to. If more people stick around than they are anticipating, then layering is going to become permanent.
---
Basically, layering is only gong away if the servers become underpopulated enough to not need a second layer.
---
&gt;Not what patchwerk data I have seen says.
---
Not everyone that cleared Naxx was playing optimally, i've seen Classic vids where bosses have stings or t2 debuff, or mark on them, most guilds wouldn't let you run any of those, which would drastically decrease your dps.
---
First of hunters dont deal best static dmg no move etc. they are 3d.  
---
second most hunters are using wrong specc and using raidbuff/support spec, if they play selfish BM spec with aimed shot.  
---
They deal top 3 without any issue, also a good hunter uses spellpower on their gear becuse it increases their damage when they can do arcane shot(not used often but with enuff spelldmg it deals great ton of damage arcane shot is increased by spelldamage same with poison sting and it scales like crazy cohe.  
---
third damage meters are bugged and dont count the pets damage correct and hunters damage comes alot from the pet, since the highest dmg specc have most of its dmg % talents on your pet.  
---
the pet deals around 50% of your damage in a fight.  
---
many hunters dont know how to weave well, no one can do it perfect.  
---
on most fights if hunters are not buff bitches or kite bitches. with equal footing in gear.  
---
you dont see a hunter without bitch spec nowdays, problem is if you dont bitch specc rogues and its very very odd.  
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/hunter/BegwMx9AA8NiDAA](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/hunter/BegwMx9AA8NiDAA)  here you go highest damage pve specc for hunter.  
---
For some odd reason ppl think other specc yields more damage wich is ludacris since the % scaling of all other talents are weak and yields nothing compared to this one with % increase of dmage per talent point and how many there is.
---
Pyroblast is pretty bad though.
---
Thanks!
---
Not consistently.  You will have some faster kills because Maul crits and none of your autos miss/dodge/parry.  As cat, every fight ends in about the same time.
---
Yeah, I remember that stairs are the fastest way to spend a blink!
---
Thanks for the info!
---
I was quite confused when mobs continued to get several swings on me after a cone of cold with the 2/3 in the inc slow talent. 
---
Thought I had just misremembered.
---
Nobody really knows what’s on the other side of Azeroth (yet). Who knows, maybe the next retail expansion will tell us but I’ll be too busy on Classic
---
This
---
Well PvE servers are for pussies
---
&gt; Actually guys you are all wrong, Patchnotes are also wrong so i dont blame you. Here is the proof: Shurik's PVP Video from 2005-05-17 (its legendary and you can also watch it on warcraftmovies if you dont trust youtube and want to pay for premium ofc.)
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiEdH1Qsg44 If you go to the 1:00 Minute Mark he is fighting a Hunter losing its target, autoselects his pet, reselects the Hunter and has his FULL Combopoints. That is how it actually was after the 1.40 Patch
---
&gt; Here is also a noob video recorded 2005/10/08 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii1bfARVFfk At the 6:00 Minute mark the Rogue gets feared/loses target. Accidentally selects a different Target and then switches back to his original Target with also having his FULL CP.
---
&gt; So If Blizzard implements shit with losing CP however its not going to be authentic. Feel free to share.

---
I think the alterac ruins were littered with poo piles as well
---
No idea.  That's just what I remember reading years ago.
---
Race only matters to the min maxers. Enjoy the game how you want and don't worry about it.
---
oh no a mage got touched in pvp, definitely bugged
---
Never played with it enough to find that out. Before i ever had a lvl 60 i decided to reroll mage just for blink. Once i got it and realized every slight incline glitched it i just quit playing mage. It was such a disappointment.
---
&gt; can’t have alts on the other faction
---
On a Normal server you can.
---
PoM Pyro fun tho
---
Wait launch is on Friday? Isn’t it on Tuesday the 27th?
---
That's too bad. They did improve it a lot even over vanilla's lifetime.
---
Aaaaaaaaaand that's a bookmark
---
I remember specifically looking at the manual and my brother said he was going to play a dwarf mage only to find out it wasn’t a thing. I looked recently at class race combos for horde and alliance and humans and trolls can be 6 classes, orcs, undead, night elf, and dwarves can be 5 classes, and gnomes and Tauren can be 4 classes. So that was probably the balancing reason to make horde and alliance equals
---
Correct. It was fixed in TBC. In Vanilla it doesn't do shit.
---
Blink, evocation, mana shield, blizzard, frost bolt...
---
lvl 20-30 mage is also nearly the worst class you can have in your group for dungeons.
---
3 spells=out of mana
---
1 hit taken=dead
---
Gnomeregan with 2 mages in your group? Have fun.
---
It’s bad it makes retail look good
---
But time makes you bolder, even children get older, and I'm gettin' older, too.
---
I think you're missing OPs point. Everyone on this sub acts like there's a right way and a wrong way to do everything and unless you're min/maxxing you're going to have a bad time and that's just outright false, especially considering the majority of players don't even raid.
---
WHOOOOSH
---
I think nelf rogues look pretty sick in gear.
---
Dwarf Mages are so good, they can make portals to other dimensions at lvl 1.
---
Thats why you never see them
---
There is a half second windup to firing auto.  The rest you run for.  On a 4s concussive shot, you can squeeze off up to four autos without losing distance to target.
---
Kind of on the other side of it I remember another time in Cataclysm. A friend and I were chaining heroics, and as we often did, just chilling in Vent while watching movies/shows/anime on another screen. Noticed the tank had a really weird spec, like none of his talents were maxed out and the entire prot tree was like 1/3 2/5 3/5. So I mentioned he should look up a build to follow.
---
He shot back "I play this game to have fun and chill out after work. I'm not making this another job." It's like bro. I'm not telling you to take a few hours to study some stuff. Take two minutes, look at a good build and copy it, it'll make the game easier for you and anyone you group up with for almost no effort.
---
This community is massive and surprisingly active with nearly 300 members like 15 officers / class leaders and a really methodical game-plan for hitting Classic running. I know it sounds early, but it's never too soon to start networking with the hardcore players that are going to make Classic a long-term success.
---
&gt;orc/troll bonuses aren't THAT significant.
---
\&gt; 25% stun resist isn't that useful... wut?
---
Not so much for Alliance, but for Horde, the teleports are so amazing too.  You can set your hearth wherever you want and still instantly hop over to the other continent any time you want.  You can level in Silverpine and be in WC within 5 mins.  You can level in The Barrens and be in SFK within 5 mins.  It's still nice in the 30s as well.
---
But your missing the build up
---
To the fight. As a cat, after hopping out of your form you must heal and then when you pop back in. You must wait for the energy to regenerate. This downtime makes the 5% dps increase pointless for a speed levels. The downtime that exists with cat with the marginal dps bonus isn’t as efficient as casting your rejuv/healing touch. Then swap into bear then spam maul. It’s just more efficient.
---
It’s the classic argument of using spirit gear on a warrior. Because stacking str won’t give you as much uptime increase to justify the downtime that exists as a warrior, stacking spirit to increase the downtime by 50% with a cost of 5% damage increase.
---
If you started with 100 energy as a cat, then it would be better. But due to the fact you must wait, it gives it a worse light in my view.
---
So with the guy whom I originally replied to saying he killed the mob faster so therefore he took less damage is ignoring everything that isn’t in the combat to his justification. Cat form at lv 20 is pointless for a speed leveler
---
I have never seen a well known Druid day that cat is better than bear at lv 20. Any that say are misinformed.
---
Yeah but polymorph and that sweet int buff
---
Hunters are one of the hardest classes to play in PvP classic.
---
It is a class heavily affected by nuance.
---
No, people are complaining that leeway is literally double what its ever been, at max it was 7-8 yards and in the beta its closer to 14, which is insanity.
---
Not until level 20 :))
---
Still much better than layering though. I'd rather preserve the game even if it means a day or two of inconvenience.
---
Soon (not tm). I've done a house move recently so had no time. :(
---
Now the ZED is making sense... Username checks out. All hail the syrup gods!
---
Just because it's not the answer you want doesn't mean he's not giving you one.
---
He is probably from retail where it’s one or other and has no idea that wands are something every cloth caster equips along with a weapon in Classic.
---
If that was true (it isn't), then Master of Deception was also broken since it worked identically:   
---
&gt; [Master of Deception](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=13970/master-of-deception)   
---
&gt; Apply Aura: Mod Stealth Effectiveness (Aura 154)    
---
So are you arguing that MoD was broken in vanilla? Since they were both passive auras that improved Mod Stealth Effectiveness by the similar amounts.
---
* Learn lockpicking
---
* Get your pre-BiS
---
* Don't piss of the Warriors by getting ironfoe
---
A perfect bullseye for my Orc’s arrows.
---
There's no math.   It's a debate over escape artist vs other intangible advantages.
---
Don't forget Bestial Swiftness.  Faster pulls for the pet is huge as well.
---
I mean the pet is the most i.portant ability for hunter. Give a hunter aspect of the cheetah and all spells without pet or give him pet, mend and the pet has pet abilities and see which one levels faster.
---
The passive aura doesn't get applied for Shadowmeld. It's been tested extensively, talked over a ton in EJ, and even tested again in the Beta.
---
Goodbye.
---
I can confirm I have done a shit quest in bfa.
---
And yes in both forms of the previous statement.
---
"yOu ReCcOmEnDeD a pRiVaTE SErVeR u ShOulD BE bANNEd"   
---
lololololololhahahahhahahalolololololhahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahhahalolololololol, man you must get invited to parties often
---
I wouldn’t be to worried. As a mage player anything that gets me out of pressing another frostbolt will be exciting!
---
I remember way back helping a warrior guildy(alliance) on his warrior quest and we were getting wrekt by the elite.
---
There was a tauren druid on the other side of the river killing the turtles.
---
We were able to gesture to him asking for help and he came and we were finally able to down the elite.
---
From that moment on whenever I passed by that druid we always helped each other out cross faction.
---
Yup, Shattered Hand. We were all in the guild Stoic.
---
I thought this as well, but basically from what I've read and some googling you attack when your character's circle touches the other character's circle.   Races like gnomes have a smaller circle.
---
Blink is top 5 spells
---
It was kind of a weird situation I was in. I did like most of the people and the guild culture mostly but there was a lot of behind the back talking.
---
In the server there were maybe 2-3 guilds in BT/Sunwell, 2-3 in TK/SSC which I was in one of them. And then all the rest like 4-5 in Tier 4 slightly getting into Tier 5 stuff.
---
And the guild I was in was I think the best progressed in Tier 5. I tried to move up into the Tier 6 guilds but I couldn't because of my gear, they wanted me Tier 6 before I could attend Tier 6 stuff.
---
I just stuck with it, I was a teenager at the time playing with college aged people. I don't think I was matured enough at the time to get myself out of that.
---
I'd never seen someone so excited over finding a giant piece of shit. I don't expect I ever will again either. lol
---
ecksdee
---
&gt; That and not having a good resurrection ability really stinks in 5 man instances
---
This is the only thing that busts my balls as a druid, and the reason I will be tanking 5mans until i dont need any gear out of them this time around
---
&gt; dead servers due to tourists is not a minor problem
---
He already offered a solution to that: server merging. The point was that despite the inconvenient of merging servers, it's still better than merging layers. Either way, they both end up being merged, but layering continually ruins the game the entire time they exist.
---
Never heard anyone suggest BM in vanilla for anything other than pvp
---
Yeah its 3 Mark's for a win and 1 for a loss in the version of AV we're getting right? 
---
Pretty much promotes van drek rushes and may the fastest team win.
---
Shit I'm going nelf warrior cuz I like nelfs and that's enough for me lol no need to minmax race unless you're going for world firsts
---
You should make an undead rogue 1-10 if you have not already!
---
I would say your are a disgrace to your faction.... but it’s a disgrace to play alliance so oh well
---
"Is there a formula or "rules of thumb" for determining a targets hitbox size and geometry?"
---
&gt;Shape is always circular. Creature hitbox varies, of course. Player hitboxes are consistent though the exact size rarely matters (I believe it's 0.5yd radius). 
---
What actually matters is combat reach. That's always 1.5yd for players, and larger for larger creatures. The distance away that you can attack a creature is...
---
Melee attack: MAX(5, SourceCombatReach + TargetCombatReach + 4/3) + IfSourceAndTargetAreRunning(8/3)
---
Ranged attack: SourceCombatReach + TargetCombatReach + AttackRange + IfSourceAndTargetAreRunning(2)
---
AoE: TargetCombatReach + AttackRadius + IfSourceIsRunning(2)
---
The IfSourceIsRunning bit is what we refer to as leeway. The CombatReach amount (1.5y each for players) is being added to the minimum distance. The game is checking to see if you're actually 8 yards away from being able to shoot your target, which results in a reality of 11yards.
---
I couldn't care less if a bunch of uninformed people downvote me, when this shit goes unchanged and makes it to live it's because that's **exactly** how it was in Vanilla.
---
BuT iT dOeSn't AfFeCt GaMePlAy OP
---
Do you have to download a new launcher for Classic? Is it on the main website? Want to have the correct one already available on August 12th to reserve names.
---
I'm all for NoChanges, but I really love the idea of these zones. If Blizzard created them with a Vanilla mentality, I think it would be awesome and give people more choices in the leveling experience. Good job on these!
---
Agreed. I have a TON of friends coming back for the game and my biggest fear is our schedules not aligning or people out leveling/raiding everyone else and leaving the rest of us in the dust.
---
There is a certain camaraderie among Hunters that transcends factions. At least I've always felt that way.
---
Not sure about you, but I don't have to pop out and heal after every kill when using Cat.  I also break form, bandage, then Regrowth when I do need to pull.  The HoT from Regrowth will sustain you through the next kill.  I can then get 3-4 more kills before I need to do it again.  Plenty of opportunities to start with 100 Energy.
---
You're gonna have to provide some evidence if you thing grounding totem should stop scream or arcane explosion because I doubt you'll find anyone that thinks it ever worked that way. It's always been targeted spells only.  
---
  
---
Running out of range before tremor pulses was also a very common normal thing in vanilla.
---
Nothing was super exciting about AV back in Classic. It was about farming your rep so you could buy the epic weapons. I've played about 6 hours worth on the beta and yes, it's still not that exciting. Compounded with the fact that none of your honor is totaled, it doesn't seem like you're progressing. The progressing part made it bearable.
---
Look up what tauren mounts are.
---
Yee...maybe. 
---
But low lvl runs tend to be more fast and chaotic with a lot of hald-emergency accidently pulls, were a class that can take two or three hits or dps for a longer time/doesn't need to cast rly helps.
---
Just my experience
---
After 30 mages or 40 I like mages in dungeons a lot more.
---
Every class has it's peaks and lows in a certain lvl range and mage's worst time is 20-30 imo
---
Oh that I’m aware of. Hilarious! Can’t believe they thought that would work xD
---
Can you imagine an ice mage with stoneform? That sucker would never die.
---
Yeah that's probably not a top tier combo. If you do want a 60 of both dual boxing would still be the quickest way to do it though.
---
Don't we all at some point?
---
There are maths, amount of deaths you could have escaped thanks to your racials
---
It's actually when both parties are moving but thats a mute point
---
I grinded until I got the unstoppable Force. Never had really loooooong av matches tbh.
---
What would you consider good combo's? Any duo leveling combo or char with similar rotations
---
Probably if everyone bitches too much Blizzard will do something if people start stream sniping and camping, but my guess is streamers will have their people too so everything will be fine
---
If they burn out in a few short months, they were probably going to do the same if it was Live. So who cares? I wouldn't want those people in guilds anyways.
---
So opinions basically.
---
You’re borderline special if you really think the current blizzard team that brought you the last 4 wow coach’s. Could put together new content for a game that’s philosophy has been completely been forgotten by that company. They don’t know what makes classic good, they’re doing it for the fans. Nothing more or less
---
I am 100% on all fears being blocked my grounding totem until it was destroyed by a physical spell (once every 10 seconds).
---
I’m talking this sequence
---
1. Engage shadow priest 
---
2. Drop totem
---
3. Get feared regardless 
---
4. Buff still on me
---
5. Totem wanded 
---
6. Get mindblasted, silenced and dotted. 
---
7. Question life choices
---
I feel pretty blessed as a Paladin at 40 getting Holy Shock, free Mount, and Plate.
---
Maybe not spells *per se* but those are super solid perks in one single level and definitely make it feel like you've "arrived," with a strong heal/DPS range spell, a ride, and a shitload more defense.
---
88th and counting…
---
Not long enough. This does not satisfy my nostalgia.
---
Yes you can DE up to skill level 60 in the beginning you will get a point for every DE in the end its about 10% chance
---
Only a few priests from the Ancient Times know how to properly deal with hunters. I am one.
---
&gt; Let's hear a realistic one please.
---
PVP is dumb. Let's move on.
---
It’s waste of a rebuff slot.
---
If you were planning on going shadow priest though you should go undead!
---
I agree with this. I've seen this first hand on private servers, and sniffing around at guilds that are recruiting now for classic, it does seem that world buffs will be mandatory for most. 
---
I'm hoping 1.12 itemization is enough that this doesn't get to private server levels. I do agree that world buff stacking is clearly not intended to be used as it is, and that it lowers the quality of raids as a result. Atleast it did for me last time.
---
&gt;Blastershot Launcher. 
---
you mean the warrior gun?
---
The main though is just pairing people who can run fast together - druid/hunter/shamy, and then also pairing people that benefit a lot from healing up with a healer - warlock/warrior/rogue with any healer.
---
It's closer to 8%, I know a mage kept up with my ret paladin traveling.
---
My fiancé is playing a priest part of why I like warrior/warlock to be a good pair I wonder if we will be a good trio...
---
By then i was a raiding rogue. I didn't max out another character till i switched to deathknight. My rogue never made it to lvl 80, but i did manage to get a priest to 80 before cata. Then i took the priest to 85 in cata, farmed the sandstone drake and quit.
---
Can you guys stop posting this crap?
---
No one really cares that you can’t get into the beta.
---
Druid wins hands down, for feral form (technically not a trainer skill but yeah)
---
"Points to anus"
---
Always thought the Eastern Kingdoms looked like one of the giant earth elemental models they introduced in BC. It’s got the horn (Eversong Woods, Ghostlands) on its head, like the crystal ones in Hellfire Peninsula had, with the jaw being Arathi Highlands. Also the eye is Caer Darrow.

I just can't see how people sit and play for almost 2 days straight without sleep. Fuck that. I booked the first week off of work to go ham and I will try my best to get 16h in a day but that will even be difficult. I mean kudos to them for that but there's no way for the majority of us its possible.
---
Grounding totem only works on single target projectile spells. AOE's and non-damaging spells are unaffected by it
---
How mana efficient are shaman healers with single target heals? I assume chain heal is not very efficient.
---
That sounds exactly how I'd expect any shamy vs priest duel to go in vanilla. Rank 1 sw:p eats any grounding totem and tremor either gets destroyed before scream is used or in the second after scream goes off before it pulses (if you drop it when they scream). Against a good priest neither grounding or tremor will be much use. Really the only way to use grounding totem against someone who is decent is in the .5 sec before a spell finishes casting - or right before you think they will CS/silence.
---
I’m 100% counter spell was blocked by grounding totem.
---
My classic story, I’ll try to keep it short. I started in 2006, a buddy knew an older guy at work who played and after watching the South Park episode we all decided to give it a try. It took us a while to catch on but I was in my late 40s when tbc hit. There’s so much I remember about classic but also a lot I know I never got to experience. I didn’t get into beta but that’s ok, I’m just glad I’ll get to go back and do the things 15 year old me never got to experience. I still play retail and have never stopped. I’m not the player I used to be but I still enjoy leveling and playing casually collecting mounts and such. My drive to play current wow may not be the same but my love for the game still remains &lt;3. Can’t wait for classic.
---
Grounding totem never stopped Aoe anything, including Aoe fears.
---
You're thinking of Tremor Totem.
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Grounding_Totem
---
Its *never* worked on AOE spells. 
---
As commented already, it only works on targeted spells.
---
^This! If people are worried about beta burning people out then they aren't worth it to begin with. If a few months of gameplay are enough to burn you out then you wouldn't get far anyways come launch. It would probably take you over month to get max level then do MC/Ony for a few months. Hopefully, this weeds people out so we have a stable population for a bit then a bunch of people with gaming A.D.D.
---
I know, and I disagreed
---
I think layering is better but it still needs work
---
OK but are you not playing for fun!!!
---
Shouldn't we be having 2 of these conversations per week?   At this rate it will take 2 months just to cover each class.
---
Yeah grounding totem never absorbed physic scream or intimidating shout.
---
This is a great idea, play when the majority will be sleeping!
---
It is on modern tech but there may be system delays that are deliberately put in place. I dont know though.
---
Do you have any proof that it doesn't?
---
Yes. I am getting silenced and counter spelled through the totem whilst trying to heal. I have the buff applied and it’s not absorbing counter spell, making GOOD mages almost impossible.
---
At level 10, tame an owl and use it until you learn level 2 claw (pet ability), then abandon the owl and tame a cat and teach it level 2 claw
---
THE level
---
THE contested pet
---
I never level capped in Vanilla, but damn the No Contest crew inspired me to PvP in later xpacs from your reputation on the server.
---
Not me, it was actually the rogue group against the Hunter who got the corehound tooth
---
Feral druids have to farm Crowd Pummelers in Gnomer just like locks have to farm soup shards
---
Cool, post the clip/gif then and it'll get upvoted to frontpage and blizzard will fix it.
---
How do you know this?
---
beat you to the punch!
---
Anyone else that is interested in playing with a big group of friends, feel free to add me as well :D
---
BATTLE.NET: Durrian#1563
---
Nope, whether it’s good or bad, people will use it against them. Ima just enjoy classic and not worry about that stuff.
---
I agree with him. Play what you want. If someone wants you to play something you don't want to, avoid playing with them.
---
If you’re talking about the video put out by classicwinds it doesn’t even show world mobs being easier lol, the majority of mobs in the video were close to the same with damage values usually off by a single point. The only real differences seen in the video were toward the end  when some mobs on pservers had significantly more hp than in classic. Which is a much more significant difference than a point or two of damage because the mob will take you longer to kill and thus also do more damage to you. The only thing more challenging in classic is that regen rates look lower for mana users at low levels, but they start evening out as you level.
---
This. The long games are not fun. I played a 2 1/2 hour long AV today. Felt like a good time for that type of battleground, 2-3 hours. But days long is not fun and less than an hour long massive BGs are just terrible and boring as well.
---
A tug of war massive game style with objectives sounds a lot more fun. Maybe the end goal is to summon your boss by picking up the crystals and armor scraps. When that boss is summoned you get an advantage in your push towards the end and you need to control all of the flags or graveyards to win.
---
Give it like a 2 or 3 hour time frame. Whoever is farthest along in that time frame if theres no winner wins. Give them 9 flags or graveyards so there’s no tie to determine the winner.
---
They need to have this in place for launch so its jut going to be something that we have to accept. Hopefully they only keep it for a few weeks tops and then most people will be out of the leveling early area shit show but not high enough level to really abuse it.
---
And now, Blizzard is trying to more accurately emulate Vanilla WoW using a later architecture and some things just aren't translating.  Issues of values being off are often not as bad as mechanical issues.
---
Of course they do.  If you think that their purpose of being there is to actually test.  They are press invites designed to build hype, show the game, get people interested, and create large showings to bring back old memories.  I wouldn't doubt if in doing a lot of these things passive data and information is gathered by Blizzard but we won't ever really know right.
---
It pretty much is up to everyone else which is actually the vast majority of testers in the beta to find bugs and report them.  Also, it should go without saying but some streamers are pretty dedicated to testing and reporting as well.
---
Basically get fkd if you’re going to meme at the end of a reasonable post.
---
Gl getting to the last enchanting trainer at 35 lol
---
I'm not looking to bash blizzard I just want to see how much of the old community returns or how many new people it attracts
---
Each to their own. Sometimes it’s nice to just chill. Got a lot of shit goin on anymore.
---
What Tauren mounts?
---
I’m 100% you’re wrong. 
---
With spell batching your totem most likely already absorbed a spell before being silenced. 
---
Also, you both have to be in range of the totem for the effect to work. You’ll see the totem’s icon with your buffs.
---
Truuuuuueeee, if you take pride in quickly defeating raid bosses that have already been killed - good for you!

Nobody in December will care who killed Rag first.
---
That being said - fuck feral, balance, elemental and enhancement.
---
Details already works in Classic Beta and shows everything.
---
Cool response, bro.
---
I agree, play what you want. BUT THAT BEING SAID...
---
If I was a guild leader, I would give myself the 1st duplicate binding as a joke.  Then when the set drops, I ninja it, and gquit.
---
This is advanced noobery yes
---
Fire ward *Fap Fap Fap*
---
Literally as this thread is alive I got curse of tongues applied through grounding totem.
---
Not to mention DBM will scream at you for everything efficiently in WoW Classic.
---
Wrecked - enjoy playing in August
---
That I'll feel apathy towards the game. While I'm absolutely looking forward to it, I worry that I'll get a similar reaction to when I try to play retail for 1 day every 6 months. Although Classic will be infinitely better, I can't completely blame the flawed direction I think the game went in on all the magic being gone for me.
---
I remember in vanilla the adrenaline of running through duskwood at low levels, the awe of getting my first fiery weapon enchant, the blast of a time I had exploring high level zones as a low level player. The monitor might as well not have been there, it felt like I was in the game.
---
I definitely don't get any of that anymore. And I think that nostalgia is a big part of what we all miss. I'm just not sure how much of it I'm going to feel. That said I'm still very excited for some good old 60 undead rogue pvp and will 100% enjoy that.
---
These were some of my favorite interactions in Vanilla, the rare moment where the hatred is forgotten and enemy players help each other out, even becoming friends.
---
I recall a certain Paladin on my realm, we used to see each other in BGs and the open world all the time, after a while we stopped insta-attacking each other and would wait for one another to drink/eat up before the bloodshed would begin. Good times.
---
Why do you think Blizzard got rid of them in the first place? 
---
That said... 
---
#\#NoChanges 
---
Classic is not supposed to be a version of WoW that "takes classic sensibilities and combines them with lessons learned over fifteen years to create the next great MMO experience". It's literally just supposed to be as close to vanilla as possible, a museum piece, a snapshot of the past, a way to (re)experience something that was lost to the sands of time. I've repeated \#WartsAndAll repeatedly to make a point that part of Classic is to show players that Vanilla isn't, in fact, perfect. Classic was a great starting point but some of the nostalgia around the game needs to be dispelled by players actually experiencing the pain and frustration of what the game actually was. That is the best path forward for the franchise. The hatred for modern WoW that festers due to false memories or misconceptions about what vanilla was can only be excised by experiencing the tedium/monotony.
---
Show proof with the Grounding Totem icon in your buffs, with you standing next to the totem.
---
That chat killed me lol
---
Biggg truuuu
---
I know this is an older thread, but for some help with the rotation you can use the info from this guide:
---
[https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/wow-classic-pve-enhancement-shaman-guide/#plink-rotation-gameplay-tips](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/wow-classic-pve-enhancement-shaman-guide/#plink-rotation-gameplay-tips)
---
It would probably take like 8 hours per boss but it is doable
---
When you join a guild you agree to the terms of it. So find one that fits you. There will be more hardcore guilds that require certain classes. There will be guilds that don't give a shit because for the most part comp doesn't matter in classic. It just depends on what you want out of classic. It is the same thing on retail, there are guilds that when you join you know you are signing up to play certain things when they are flavor of the month. There are also guilds that have feral druids and they clear content not the fastest but not the slowest either.
---
I believe you, but got a source so I can link to some friends?
---
Oh my god we get it already, you enjoy a slower pace when gaming. How many posts about this " guys listen here now, I'm gonna play computer games the way I enjoy playing them! Woah did I blow your mind already" posts does this sub need?
---
Sorry classic won’t be available in cars
---
Wow.. They’re referring to the way blizzard is achieving the spell-batching effect as of right now being incorrect, not the the entire implementation of it being a bad idea. To imply the spell-batching as a whole is just a “private server hero” thing that doesn’t really matter is misinformed and silly.
---
Wow that has to be the single biggest neckbeard comment I've ever seen really cringey.
---
Here's the one that started it all
---

Let’s keep the twitch shit inside twitch chat please
---
You may have good intentions, but this is the internet. People rather bash and complain rather than give praise. But, i can guarantee you they will release numbers if they completely destroy expectations
---
It did. The tunnel on the horde side of WSG was like a blink death trap. Usually anything that was an slope you were taking a risk.
---
I mean, if fucking dogs makes you happy then more power to you.
---
I'm trying to remember some of the guys. Think there was a rogue named skittles that lead a lot of the BG groups. I remember the alliance had this NE warrior, think his name was motorcycle. Had some great 1v1s with him. Rank 1 purge to put him in combat so he couldn't charge then blow him up with CL and ES.
---
If Reddit had free speech I would tell you to go fuck yourself.
---
Can you please provide the source for these then? Because the only hitbox and range differences when googled are for tauren.
---
For non warriors try forwards on gas pedal backwards on the break and jump on the clutch
---
Blizzard announced it.
---
Surprised Pikachu
---
No
---
Lol of course
---
Don't even blame him for miss-remembering, it's hard to keep track.
---
They change and remove systems every expansion.
---
Most games just build on those systems, instead of completely gutting them and re-using the same names every expansion.
---
This is why no one cares what you say. You can't even form a relevant and rational thought.
---
Foreshadowing my dude
---
I assume the majority of players don't want to go anywhere near pservers.
---
Not for leveling though. Open with pyro and most mobs go down in a couple of shots
---
Private servers are almost as evil as streamers if you ask this community.
---
Healing as a paladin is mostly flash of light spam and buffing. 
---
Changing specs for anyone will get expensive overtime (capping at 50g per swap) so that's a tough one. 
---
With that said, I'm going to he rilling pally come classic.
---
This is nonsense... We had access to all the information, we had videos, we had practice in raids. We were certainly not playing at 5 fps either.
---
We had 100s of hours in the game, nobody was a clicker.
---
This myth that we are now somehow THAT much better is total bull.
---
Nobody cares.
---
Fye
---
It caps at 1.5 levels, which takes 10 days.
---
3+ years of playing the vanilla iteration of this game, reading forums. Have never heard of even a conspiracy theory of differing hotboxes outside of Tauren.
---
Pretty sure you misspelled warlock, the absolute squishiest class. 
---
Priests are much harder to focus.

2004-gpus run Wow really well..... it was a low demand game.

Are people able to put chinese characters in retail now on american servers?
---
About her personally? I have no opinion. About misogynistic neckbeards who call women "thots"? I am not so keen on those.
---
Tauren is horde and when you are clueless you go alliance
---
Ok swifty
---
Yeah healing's okay I played on a Blizzlike classic server to level 30 as a holy pally and I dug it. Did BFD and SFK
---
&gt; They had ganked her multiple times to the point where she could not play the game, I thought you knew this as it was talked of in this thread but that is my mistake.
---
So she kept streaming, logged off and played another game (retail) for a bit and came back. She was not prevented from streaming, or even from streaming WoW, just from streaming Classic WoW on that character at that moment. She did exactly what everyone recommends you do if you are getting corpse camped by griefers.
---
&gt; Furthermore, I meant that she did not need to stream classic not in general.
---
I agree with that.
---
Exactly. Using this “test” of AV has no bearing on how it will be once live.
---
Here's my shorter streamlined guide
---
1. Accept quests
---
2. Complete them
---
3. /dance
---
Tell me what was relevant or rational about your first response? Nothing actually. It was an attempted attack on character because you couldn’t dispute what I was saying. The reality is, dognuts like you can’t help me suckle at the tit of anything related to the disgusting shit beasts. You fantasize about them. You trying to integrate them into everything. You froth at the mouth at the idea of a mindless beast worshiping you because you feed it. You and ever other dognut are mentally weak and require admiration. Dogs fill that void for you.
---
I know. Fire Ward is sick.
---
Roller coasters tend to last a minute maybe a minute and a half... yet tend to have the longest line. Just because there will be a wipe; doesn't mean that it can't really enjoyable for the brief time you play.
---
Private servers are normally enormously corrupt and have many bugs.
---
When I recruit, I don't worry much about things that are heavy time commitments(like BiS dungeon gear).
---
Things like class, spec and enchants don't take much time though. They just show a minimum effort went into preparation.
---
They don't care about the graphics/animations
---
Simple and sad as that
---
For me healing is more fun then dps in raids there are alot fewer healers then dps making what you do more important for raid success. Healing is also more reactionary then dps making it more enjoyable. How ever paladins probably have the most boring healing basically hitting one button in raids. Healing in 5 man is always more enjoyable.
---
iirc  they didnt get mounts, they got the ability to run faster
---
Yeah see Blizz removed glyphs with purpose so they didnt have to balance them. But they cant just remove a major profession (inscription). So they made it cosmetic only, like my warrior catches fire when she enrages.
---
I would farm 2-4 in 20ish minutes whenever I was waiting around for other things.  I did one weekend where I built a small stockpile so I always had between 3-8 in the bank.  Most raids I'd use 2 in BWL.  If I was DPS, I'd usually use more, 1 or 2 charges per boss.
---
I agree. TAKE MY UPVOTE.
---
Well then why do people fight this logic when we point out Private Servers with classic AV *STILL HAVE PEOPLE RUSHING BOSSES*? In the end, whatever the players want to do is what happens. Doesn't matter what version of AV is in.
---
This affects melee trying to kite other melee as well. Why are you being so reactionary?
---
so this means i wont have problem raiding as 30/0/21 shaman? hope so lul cus i intend to show up
---
The first time I stepped into Deadmines was the also the moment I knew I'd be playing this game for a long time. I was a total newb, and I have a vivid memory of playing a warrior, and I was still using a gray 2h weapon at the time. An obviously more experienced group was running through there and took me along. I ended up getting killed solo by one of the parrots on the docks...
---
I made up an excuse and told them I had to leave because I was so embarrassed.
---
Some of us wiped for months trying to carry optimal players through the content.
---
Aimed shot, that's all you need
---
Oh man I wish they had kept it! Just make it like work like summoning a mount instead of the running idea
---
That’s helpful thanks, I played rogue at the time where the rotation felt very reactionary, which I enjoy....
---
Is there another healing class that is less spammy? Thx
---
Its also a ton of people dicking around with classes.
---
Have to have pet out of combat as well
---
Man up and say it
---
Level tailoring and de your made goods
---
I can only speak for myself but I want to get into the beta to optimize my levelling rout 1-30 to get ahead of the pack on release.
---
I didn't get a beta invite and I am trying the Pserver for the first time just to get a refresh in the starting 1-20 levels and quest routes.
---
Your expectations are going to be sorely disappointed. I wish they weren't, but I can't see it any other way with the max honor farm mentality many people have now.
---
Awesome bro! I am Roc from Shattered Hand, night elf rogue!
---
That makes sense because its not corrupt to charge a subscription to be able to test a beta and there are no bugs in the beta either.
---
That’s why I said “players vote on options curated by the dev team”.
---
Both excellent examples!
---
Perfection.

Not true at all lol alot of ppl prefer wpvp
---
Fuck you and fuck asmongold lmao
---
15 years, *15 years*, I've enjoyed this game breaking exploit, and you ruin it with one video. Thanks for nothing.
---
That poor bastard who went 13 and 59
---
It makes it easy to uninstall the game and move on with your life.
---
Healing a raid is completely different from anything else I have ever done. Its chaotic where you end up staring at raid frames dropping health rather than the boss itself. Like filling up 40 cups full of water constantly dropping down. While dps focus on rotations you will focus on their health plates. I personally had fun because the shittier the raid group knowledge the more fun I had healing. After a few weeks raid healing is not as insane because you grasp the tempo. However raiding makes 5 man dungeons look like absolute easy mode. I respecced for shits and giggles every few weeks to dps for around 15g. Total pain in the ass. Pally is so awesome for raid buffs and divine intervention wipe prevention.
---
I know everyone says it sucks but this went in the math on it for me please?
---
Honestly, I just want beta to set up my UI. Then I'd probably level seriously anyway like an idiot because I *just want to play.* I could roll on a private server, but those are tweaked and not what we'll be getting in August.
---
If Classic in its current state was released today as a private server it would be laughed at for bad scripting and bugs.
---
Good thing Blizzard has two more months to fix the most important stuff.
---
Literally every AV game I got into on beta was less than an hour &gt;&lt; Not sure how people are getting these super long games D:
---
https://i.imgur.com/C3bCM0V.png
---
[Most people here](https://aablain.github.io/wow-classic-survey/) have played on PSers before. The reason people want to play beta is to be apart of the community/hype mainly - and also because of the minor fixes/differences from PS are fun to see and you get to set up your addons and UI and things.  
---
You're right, if people purely wanted to just play vanilla and play with specs/questing they would just play private servers.
---
Because the vast majority of people are retarded
---
Well he is leveling in fire spec, what do you expect?
---
It's almost like you don't remember farming resistance gear, tubers, potions, and flasks just to be able to make it through one raid. Maybe it was different for people who were never at endgame raids but being optimal was important.
---
I don't get it. Why didn't the dwarf put down a trap himself and put monkey on instead of cheetah? This video is completely pointless
---
I would main a dwarf mage so quick. Best starting zone and race lore in the game. Having to play a gnome for the racials is annoying but oh well
---
Ouch. Now I feel my chances falling apart.  2006 account with only one beta :/.
---
It feels like the loot council should acknowledge you’re taking one for the team and factor that into their decision... if anything being a team player should move you up in that regard, shouldn’t it?
---
I think the 29.5 idea came from Beaza, a mysterious poster on wow wiki. He claimed to be the game mechanics and balancing programmer for wow . Beaza said many things, not all of them are verified  but so far NONE of his theory is proven to be wrong.
---
As with classic wow In general it’s about the experience and the social interactions. Doesn’t matter if the character is gone, they made the memories and had the fun. Doesn’t seem that complicated, it’s scary how many people have this question. No wonder BFA is so popular..
---
They kind of are, it should never have worked in instanced content and I dont think Blizzard tought that would happen.
---
But it's part of the game so, just deal with it.
---
People have tested and compared 1-30 on Classic Beta to the most well known private server core. There's almost no difference in terms of xp values so if you really just want to practice your route, ask Google for a repack. It's super easy to set up and even more efficient than private servers or Beta due to GM commands (movementspeed, .kill or flying for example) and no other players.
---
&gt; You think you do, but you don’t
---
Honestly I'm glad he messed up and said that. If he has used some prepared HR/PR-friendly answer then the backlash that led to classic being made wouldn't have happened.
---
Why would a melee class want longer range attacks?
---
Are you stupid or just trolling?
---
Melee attacks didn't have this extra range in classic.
---
It's a bug. If your target backpedals you lose this 3 yards extra range.  
---
I guess backpedalers were the true skilled pvpers back in the day cause they knew about this 3 yard decrease
---
Server: Blackrock (Unofficial Oceanic server)
---
Faction: Horde
---
Guild: &lt;The Elite&gt; Guild from DAOC &amp; Everquest
---
At the release of Wow I was 18 Years old I played a Horde Shaman named Kronoth in the guild The Elite.
---
I was only a new recruit to this Guild however the main core team had been around for a long time and had played together over many games.
---
They where a big PvP guild in other games but they found that most of the best PvP gear came from Raiding that would help them move up to Rank 14.
---
We managed to secure server first Rag kill and then after that Eminance on alliance took Nef kill and same onwards with firther expacs untill new clans came about like nurfed.
---
We managed to have 2nd kills for nearly all contant and it was a great experiance pushing classic content and seeing many of our players get Rank 14 on BG9 battle group one of the harest out there.  
---
The server had many 5 man groups that would roam the world looking for fights to grind to rank 14 between que's and the server was always alive and always hada log in time as it was Oceanic &amp; US.  
---
Blackrock is full GTFO was the moto of the server and it was always a place to remember as time went on and the oceanic servers opened up many of these people went to Barthilus and also to Frostmourne
---
Grounding totem never stopped aoe fear or any type of aoe damage ability.
---
Two totally conflicting opinions... lmao
---
Investors used those numbers against them and that is one of the main reason that they no longer publish them.
---
&gt;You're gonna get pitch forked by people who are dumb as fuck and can't comprehend what you wrote, because you worded it pretty poorly. 
---
OP writes like shit, but if you can't understand his shit, then you're dumb? What
---
I can thank both Joseph Lister for pioneering germ theory and Alexander Fleming for inventing penicillin. Good work all around.
---
Need more information. Why should I be thanking someone that started a vanilla private server DURING vanilla's peak point? And why is he the one that resurrected classic WoW. Was he a vocal advocate that was pushing for it.
---
How am I supposed to thank anyone unless I get some actual context?
---
Thank the community for staying true to what they enjoy. Blizzards just here to fuck us out of some more money.
---
Wait thank the guy who made pirate servers DURING classic? No thanks lol.
---
Yup. Nothing lasts in the end. Even Classic will die one day. Obviously a very different time scale. But if someone can play beta and have fun with it while beta is up, that's worthwhile.
---
I watched this video and felt it was important to bring it up here as well. To those of you who doesn't care to watch the full video, here are what I believe to be the most important points of discussion:
---
* A guild seeking to become number one can sabotage other guilds by removing their chance of getting all the buffs and thus their chance of competing for the record clears.
---
* Forcing players to log out of their main characters to conserve buffs limit game time and social interaction within the game.
---
* Non top tier guilds will be hard pressed to compete with top tier guilds due to inability to obtain buffs.
---
* World buffs breed toxicity as loosing them will destroy morale in raids.
---
* World buffs trivialize PvE content as some mechanics can be skipped due to the high damage output.
---
If you feel I got something wrong, please let me know so I can make an edit if need be. I personally believe it to be an issue, with the simple fix of removing world buffs upon entering a raid, but I would love to hear what you guys think as well.
---
Holy crap I am so jealous!!!!!!!!
---
They got an ability called plain stride that allowed them to run as fast as a mount.
---
Oh there was one crew that did while leveling. It was rediculous. Almost opressive.
---
I legit wish I knew what you guys meant
---
50g an hour isn't hard and 10 hours of wow a day is normal, which would even put you to 3500, but is that all he is going to do?
---
Vanilla druids have no dispel protection for their HoTs, getting completely countered by shaman Purge and priest Dispel.
---
Thieves would steal accounts, take enchanting, DE all your gear
---
They won't release any numbers unless they're massive numbers worth bragging about.
---
&gt; "work over time for no pay or get fired" There is something deeply wrong with this statement. If you are being FORCED to work OT and threatened with your job if yo don't (unless of course you are salary) that is suuuuper illegal and I am sure a lawyer would love to have a word about it.
---
In the US he might be "exempt" which means he's paid a fixed salary and then forced to work as many hours as his employer wants. This was put in place a while back to screw over tech workers because everyone hates them and wants them to suffer.
---
plain and simple impatience. It's really not far away, but feels slow for sure. In just under 2 weeks we'll be at the 2 month mark. I can't wait for the last 30 days.
---
I will never be able to unsee this.
---
Why do people play games at all? At some point the servers will go down or they will just stop playing, making all progress pointless.
---
Really? Why do you feel the need to insult people that have learning disabilities.
---
 LOL
---
YESSSSS
---
I'm talking about TBC... The dreaded world pvp killing expansion every dedicated classic pvper wants nothing to do with.
---
They'll figure it out though. They have time and endless supplies of money.
---
I don't have any stats but my random twitch viewing has led to 5/5 Horde wins. Anecdotal...
---
I'd be cool with druid tanks getting defense gear
---
Honestly, if a total stranger asks me to run a dungeon that I have 0 possible benefit from and I’m not busy, I’ll most likely go.
---
I mean, why not?  I just like playing the game and meeting new friends.
---
Yes. You think they didn't? That's one of the reasons people have such a hard time choosing a class
---
English pls
---
Hunters farm dungeons for gold, namely Maraudon at first and later Dire Maul Tribute (if Blizzard doesn't prevent it because it can seriously impact the economy). You'll do this in your usual raiding spec, your pet is used for addional damage and utility, not to hold threat.
---
MM is also perfectly fine for PvP, much better than most of the other pure raiding specs like Fury, Combat, various Warlock builds or deep Arcane Frost.
---
PvE servers are for people who don't care for ganks and basically nothing else. 
---
PvE still has all the PvP experience minus the constant corpse camping.  WoW is a PvE game with options.  Most people back then played on PvE servers because they didn't care of PvP to begin with.
---
What would u think of them somehow sneaking in defense/whatever gear for druids/paladins so they can't get crushed or can tank.
---
Would that break stuff?
---
Yes.
---
You assume wrong: https://aablain.github.io/wow-classic-survey/
---
Grounding totem eats the next damaging ability, Does no protect you from something such as curse of tongues.
---
I'd wanna bring back like almost everything.
---
Giving paladins a taunt and allowing druids to get Defense gear wouldn't be horrible I think.
---
WoWs release was the beginning of the end.
---
Shaman's 40% Ghost Wolf would like a word. ;)
---
this but WoW
---
https://youtu.be/q8SWMAQYQf0
---
Oh man, an unnamed server had super broken terrain. Mages were terrorists.
---
Still have my boxes from vanilla to wrath, they're pretty tattered though.
---
You can't rush it in this version of AV.  Maybe if you had a full team of BWL+ raid geared people able to nuke as fast as possible.. but that isn't going to be the norm at all. 
---
Even with the rush, the only thing that let it work was having nobody go back to stop it.  It was very easy to screw over rushing back then, even as horde.
---
Plainsrunning and I don't think it ever made it into game. At least I don't remember it in the vanilla beta.
---
People have been claiming for years and years that private servers are bad because you can lose your characters at anytime if a server shut down. But now we got a beta and everyone wanna play and have their characters deleted. lol.
---
what lol
---
Aren't all healers mainly.one button?   Sorry, not being silly, just not sure what vanilla healers were like.  I've researched druid heals mainly.
---
It will speed up, but pure rushing in this version of AV is going to be nearly suicide without a nearly full raid of BWL+ geared players on the same team.. which would be insanely rare to say the least.
---
Playing with no other players seems pretty unrealistic to me.
---
No it never made it in original beta.  When I said they got it I was just generally referring to the mount solution that someone pointed out.  I should have been clear that it was never implemented.
---
Yea, a lot of people keep forgetting (starting to realize most people posting never even touched vanilla) that turtling &gt; anything even in this version of AV.
---
Yes, they did have dwarf mages in closed beta. Unsure why they got rid of them, prob a balance reason
---
Everyone was younger, and there was a lot less info out there and virtually no theorycrafting.  I wouldn't be surprised if the majority of players wore things that were not BIS simply because they didn't know better.
---
They were neutral except 1 of them, the named turtle
---
That survey definitely has some sampling bias
---
That makes sense because its not corrupt to charge a full subscription for a stress test that just happens to be spread out once a month and a chance to be able to test a beta and the offer to reserve a name if you pay a subscription for 2 weeks in advance and there are no bugs in the beta either. So good point sir and thank you for sharing your wisdom to this community where 70% have played on a private server!
---
Um, I don't get why people keep saying this.  
---
It didn't take your whole team to turtle, just a good 3rd of it, which is going to happen way more often than you think it will.  You can't rush this version of AV without having a lot of raid geared individuals having at it with high DPS.
---
Looks pretty even to me, but most of the games I’ve watched have just been stomps regardless because most streamers just premade and destroy randoms.
---
Are you going to tell [Ion Hazzikostas](https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/1121853269033328641) that he's wrong?
---
Lol I watched a streamer run around the mage quarter in the air for an hour trying to find different places you could run in the air. He found some fun spots and jumping through buildings from up there.
---
No, I don't remember that.
---
They are almost identical. The biggest difference is that mobs do more damage.
---
He didn't want realism, he wanted to optimize his route.

[Ion Hazzikostas](https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/1121853269033328641) says that it won't be available until Phase 2, but idk, maybe you should trust that random guy on Reddit instead. He has the most upvotes so it must be true.
---
This... it was easily repeatable without issue. A streamer and like 5 people were doing it over and over for an hour without an issue.
---
Tbh the biggest thing is playing wow at the capped lvl they have set. Its a type of experience no one else will get to have except those in the beta.
---
The horde won an AV?
---
That's not Vanillalike
---
Yes, you are right about people taking the path of least resistance... Rushing to the end without a full team of BWL+ geared individuals isn't going to be easy what so ever, because your DPS is going to suck absolute nutsack.  
---
I can't believe how easily people have forgotten the strength of the NPC's in this version.  I know a lot of time has passed, but do you really think the average tank is going to tank all the adds and the boss and stay alive?  It was virtually impossible.. and that was when no one showed up to defend.
---
Summit, not a bad bloke with a good attitude. 
---
However he is a terrible player who doesn’t seem to get any better as time goes on.

Citation needed.

*Internal client with missing data that Nostalrius devs helped them "find"
---
That said folks have seen some grossly out of place stuff in the classic beta that isn't even related to numbers tuning - with 2k6 Vanilla videos for reference.
---
I wouldn't doubt with constant overwrites to branches of the master commit a lot of data was both still in tact and also lost to the ether as well as a few arithmetic changes due to using the new client.
---
How far back they have repositories is a mystery. Every dev is different. I have commits going back to my first project but I know devs who literally only keep the most recent and nuke anything prior.
---
Aside from old WoW devs saying the reference client is incomplete we do see video evidence of differences in regards to even things like NPC actions with videos as proof.
---
I think Blizz is hoping they get it right to not squish everyone's hopes but some stuff doesn't hold up under a microscope. Not all, but some.
---
Keep this in mind before popping off about a reference client that we now know is incomplete.
---
Getting ahead to have the zones mostly to yourself comes down to your route, knowledge, execution and a bit of luck early on. 
---
It's obviously not like the launch but everyone that has played a fresh private server start can tell you it's a shitshow of its own kind and hard to replicate on already established realms.
---
There is no value in *wasting* time on a private server fighting for tags and waiting for respawns if all you want to do is test and fine tune your route because you can't really practice the launch. There will be a fresh server next weekend if you want to experience how Classic release might look like.
---
I legit take a screenshot of every pile of shit I find in game.... I may have a problem.
---
Highly doubt the majority of players will even have epic mounts in the first year of release.  
---
One thing still holds true.  Time = money.  People might be better, but making money isn't just based on skill, it is absolutely based on the notion of pure grind, and not many people like doing that kind of thing.
---
Carebear countdown!
---
&gt; Because Classic costs money. Private servers don't.
---
Then by your logic private BFA servers must have more players than retail BFA. Why do you keep saying such stupid stuff as if it makes any sense? People play private vanilla servers because it's the only place where they can experience vanilla, not because it's free. Most of the servers are shutting down by August 27th.
---
To be fair, the lighting is off for everything in classic.  Nothing we are seeing (even on the most default of settings) is close to how it was back then.
---
Yes. 1000x yes, you fucking imbecile.
---
Tooltip says harmful not damaging ability. It’s an offensive spell.
---
There's no way blizzard touches DM tribute solo runs. If you can't tell by now, they are very committed to doing no changes as much as possible
---
I use bartender, not for the placement but so I can color the entire ability red for out of range and not a tiny number.
---
That's about it.
---
You can't really optimize a route when server congestion is going to affect that route
---
Make one a priest. Dot + wand then switch back to your main. Switch back to reapply dots or emergency heal.
---
Works pretty well with a melee class. Have the alt set to follow your melee. When you tab into your alt, they will guaranteed be in range and facing the correct direction of the mob.
---
Also for those who are curious, this is what I believe to be the correct data, baring perhaps Hunter Crit per Agi:

---
Loosing
---
Because treasure hunter. Very rogue sort of racial ability. RP wise dwarves are good rogue candidates.
---
&gt;Which healer contributes most to dps? Either by way of buffs or their own damage.
---
Shaman.
---
&gt;Which healers can hold their own in 1v1? not just escape but actually kill. 
---
Mainly Elemental Shaman and Shadow Priest.
---
&gt;Which healers quest efficiently, being able to do decent single target damage.
---
Priests, Shamans, and Druids are all pretty good.
---
Clasic will have going to be so many people that there will be a place for everyone
---
So in other words your source no longer exists? And you're going to ignore actual game mechanics we examine in-game, and quote a forum post from memory. K. Seems legit.
---
Some people just want to be apart of the moment I suppose.  
---
I am of similar thinking though.  I would hate spending so much time, only to burn myself out going into release.  Though, without the testers doing this, things could be so much worse.
---
Problem with same server que for me was getting the same premade over and over and I just stop queuing
---
I have.  I realize there's some content droughts and pacing issues and while those areas could be improved I'm not sure adding those areas would increase player retention and be a worthwhile investment.  New content relevant to the long term player would be a more consistent draw going forward.  Overworld non instanced areas for groups of 60s is definitely lacking in vanilla.  Even the areas designed for this in blasted lands, winterspring etc are not used because the rewards are not there.  
---
I think your zones really flesh out the world and beautify the museum piece of vanilla wow but will they be a draw for new and returning players if they're no longer relevant (giving upgrades or side grades ) content ?  To this day many max level characters did not see the cata zone revamps, many of which are interesting if a little too directed.  Not enough player draw and use.  For the hate the isle of quel'danas gets on this board I guarantee every player who played during that patch quested there and found interesting emergent gameplay like the PvP during the undead invasion.  
---
All in saying is the zones need a hook to get players to return to them once the one time use content of most quests were completed to make blizzard want to bother to make the zone .
---
You say that on a subreddit where people praise blizzard for actively ruining classic.
---
And then they reprised it for the worgen
---
Yea, this has been talked about quite a bit. 
---
I am actually surprised Blizzard hasn't at least said something by now.
---
We should also ban flasks. No one have time to farm gold for that. Flasks are en exploit. Dwarf Priests are also en exploit. With that said. Your an idiot for making this post. World buffs was part of Vanilla and will be part of Classic.
---
I don’t know what I’m supposed to be looking at, curse of tongues lasts 30 seconds so how is it relevant if you could’ve put grounding down after you were already hit. Also why tf did you take a picture of your screen.
---
No one will invite a ret to premades to pvp, useless.
---
As for holy, you do not really just heal. Paladins are sought after because you cleanse, blessing of sacrifice means you can hardly ever be cced, blessing of freedom and protection, plate armor with shield, high healing output. You are a support and enable your frontline, or dpsers, to dps or get out of crowd control.
---
As for swapping specs, in theory yes. Once you realize how horrible ret is you won't swap anyway.
---
To each their own.. but you think skittering legs in stealth looks better than a smooth transition into a sleek movement?  
---
To me it just looks like piss.
---
Is there a discord? Or website available?
---
Also 2 hander
---
Quick addition to this. [Ez-Thro Dynamite](https://classicdb.ch/?item=6714#created-by) doesn't even require the profession and can be used by everyone.
---
No, they aren't suppose to be purposely altering things (already pushing it with loot trading and layering) that they can avoid doing.  
---
Your opinion means nothing if the goal is an authentic look and feel.
---
Kala is a great priest streamer who's very interactive and has a good YouTube channel as well!
---

Rofl.. yep

You can play what you want, you cannot force people to accept you however.

Get a dog and you'll see man. 
---
They are just like kids,  but better
---
I think he was a healer, so less killing blows for him!
---
I'm interested to see what kind of addons there will be with the newer backend.
---
Open it and take a second pic.   :)
---
Old one is at least a smooth transition into a sleek walk that gives the impression you are still sneaking. 
---
This new one looks like you left stealth when you start moving quickly and isn't nearly as smooth/sleek looking.
---
The goal for Blizzard has been to make it authentic.  We were told to report bugs/aspects of classic that lack authenticity.
---
Haha. That was fun, noticed him when I was questing, saw he was streaming and decided to muck around a bit.
---
&gt;But if they spec enhancement you kind of roll the dice on killing mobs fast or slowly with windfury post 30. 
---
You don't have to do the slow 2 handed Windfury thing. Shaman actually has a ton of flexibility while leveling. You can use Windfury or Flametongue with a fast dagger and it's about as efficient as a 2 Hander, because you don't lose as much efficiency with overkill damage. The advantage of using a 2 Hander is Earthbind kiting, but some people don't even bother with that because it's extra effort for slightly more efficiency. You can also start going down the Elemental tree at level 30 once you pick up Shield Spec, Thundering Strikes, Improved Lightning Shield, Improved Ghost Wolf, and Flurry as a hybrid Enhancement/Elemental spec which is good while leveling too.
---
One of the nice things about leveling a Shaman is you can really customize it to your play style without really gimping your effectiveness.
---
He took a picture of his monitor with 15 seconds left on curse of tongues and a grounding totem next to him as if he couldn’t have put it down afterward. Not even saying he’s wrong but this dude obviously isn’t the brightest and likely isn’t going to be able to actually provide evidence of anything he’s saying, there needs to be testing from people who aren’t 75iq/
---
Avoid shadow spec, get wand specialization and see the good wand dps. Just pair up with some warrior or rogue as priest and you will both level much faster, they will love you for sticking with em for a while.
---
You can heal as shadow no problem but 40+ you begin to feel the lack of healing talents, 52+ its starting to get rough.
---
I didn't think much of classic WoW but I am happy to be in beta.
---
The advantage i see is setting your addons and choosing/testing a class to get a head start at launch.
---
Oh boy would I have hate ditching the druid I thought I would love after wasting 30+lvl.
---
Not for me, back to priest for heal and warrior for tank
---
Even if the old one had no support what so ever, they should still do it due to keeping the game authentic.
---
Do you know what conflict means
---
Wasn't TBC.  It was in wrath when they sped up stealth movement substantially.  Then they brought it back in cata.. only to remove it again lol
---
actually apparently Oyoyo and Shedo are better. Shedo tops DPS charts as feral in raids, beating rogues and warriors alike: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2t7qG9SrVI&amp;t=5s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2t7qG9SrVI&amp;t=5s) 1.2k at 1:05
---
Melderon and motherfuckin defcamp
---
they are level 58, not 60. Actual AV will be a pve fest.
---
Interesting choice of insult. I'll be brief, because I can tell you only came here with the intent to waste my time. No, flasks are not an exploit. Why? You can't sabotage a guilds ability to farm gold for flasks. The end.
---
Shammies suck
---
https://willitclassic.com/
---
Guess you never raided Naxx40 where even having full Tier 2 wasn't enough. You needed resist gear, flasks, pots, raid buffs etc. Then you'd have 30 minutes after clearing trash to down bosses, otherwise it respawn. That's enough for 2 wipes. Hell, people on the  4 Horsemen would need 8 tanks. So you'd likely borrow some tanks from other guilds. Just for perspective Naxx bosses hit as hard in Vanilla as they did in Wotlk when you were 20 levels higher and had vastly better gear.
---
Yup cause it sucks. That dude is just rambling nonsense. In vanilla hunters are ok in MC/BWL. They not so great in AQ, and by Naxx they suck. If hunters were topping dps in your guild in naxx then the other dps just suck sorry. Many hunters in top guilds rerolled for TBC and then hunters were actually top dps in TBC which was pretty funny.
---
Oh yeah of course but this game isn’t always about using the absolute max dps class all the time. If you’re speed running then sure but in that case you would literally have all Mage / warrior dps. The content is gonna get done regardless of being short a couple hundred DPS.
---
What the hell are you talking about?
---
NS is so you've gone down Rest far enough that you can heal in raids and not have to respec between pve and pvp, skipping that whole conundrum entirely - as well as you know having NS to boot.
---
Night elf are way taller. Be the alpha.
---
Yeah it wont really matter. There will be good ally sides and good horde sides. And there will be terrible ones on both sides too.
---
As /u/zummit said, that restriction (not being able to make alts of the opposing faction) only exists on PvP servers, not PvE ones. Also, am I remembering this wrong, or was it not possible to bid on/buy out auctions you placed yourself, even with an alt? I'm pretty sure you needed a middleman if you wanted to transfer things to your alt of the opposing faction.
---
You can rush any version of AV with pretty minimal gear. Pre bis and maybe only need that on the tanks. As tax said, players decide how long it is. if 40 on both sides ignore and rush the games are 5-10 mins long. This stands for every version of av.
---
CoW reduces damage by a flat amount, which means it is at its strongest when a boss is hitting for small amounts, but quickly. Most bosses tend to attack slowly, and for larger amounts though. So as a percentage damage reduction, it's a poor use of a debuff slot. Compare it to thunder clap, which ALWAYS provides the same percentage damage reduction against all enemies. 
---
If there were unlimited debuff slots, yes it'd be used, but we won't have that in classic.
---
Drizzt
---
They really was not, none used them the way they are used on private servers. I for one hope blizzard removes them from raids we don't need to make pve content any easier
---
They didn't in vanilla, but they did end up fixing it in patch [2.1.0](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_2.1.0) for that very reason.
---
\&gt;  Fengus' Ferocity,Mol'dar's Moxie,Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer,  Slip'kik's Savvy and Spirit of Zandalar these buffs will no longer work  on targets over level 63.
---
Well that's just not true, but even aside from that the servers will have layering so congestion shouldn't be a huge issue.
---
Vaelstraza also did that in BWL. Another was Naxx 40 where one slip up or disconnect could wipe the raid and trash would respawn quickly which would cause you to hit a wall of no progression then have people's patience run thin and start blaming people.
---
That 18 Silver cost when the OP only has 2G 57S hurts my soul. 
---
But also excites it. 
---
Am I weird?
---
Yes, but on one hand they deal with criticism for a week.  On the other they deal with it for the entire lifespan of classic, because the bottom line is that if the game never drops more players than it gains (similar to vanilla, not necessarily same player count), then layering can never be removed. 
---
Server merges were required for less than 5% of the total servers of vanilla and TBC.   I personally don't see a problem with server merges if the occasional server out of hundreds happens to lose too many players.  
---
The issue is that Activision Blizzard doesn't want to spend more money to keep customer satisfaction high, because they likely don't want to risk anything at all for the players themselves.  This is a corporation, and most of these decisions have been based around cost cutting, not what they think will help the game more.
---
Most of what you're referring to is actually *spell batching* and that's an actual intended mechanic.
---
Oh there will be, at least for the first few weeks.
---
Mhmm i rather doubt that dude, do you have any source on it? I'd wager pvp was more popular, definitely on the whole. I remember myself as a kid rerolling my lvl 30 character from a pve server to a pvp when i realized what it was, because as much as some people may hate it, it does add to the game to others. I suspect its actually quite a 50-50 split in the end.
---
No, you and many others need to brush up on what they most recently stated...
---
Layering is in for the entire PHASE 1.  Highly doubt it will be under 3 months for a single phase.. especially since most players likely will barely be hitting 60 by then anyway.
---
That rogue is from TBC. No wonder he's so good in classic.
---
more like "so they can re-live the only thing that got them through the most depressing era of their lives"
---
I would consider using it on Broodlord, possibly.
---
Found the tryhard loser exploiting buffs on the pirated servers, lol
---
which is absolutely fine and I am all for. No idea why so many people are all "remove this now or I unsub" about this.
---
Think you forget that Naxx was tuned very hard. You couldn't just roll up with Tier 2 and clear it easy. You needed to be optimum with flasks, pots, all buffs, strata to avoid huge damage you were getting. Just for reference I beleive around 2 dozen guilds in world cleared Naxx in vanilla and took around 3 months for a guild to clear the raid. What other raids you know that took guilds that long to clear to end?
---
Hydramist is a good priest streamer
---
&gt;You use your entire kit as a druid in PVP. You don't stay in form, you don't chain cast balance spells
---
You don't continuously shift as you feel like either, to use everything at your disposal, even if you have Natural Shapeshifter and especially if you don't - otherwise you'll be oom before you know it. So you actually do try to stay in form as long as possible - open with cat and apply as much damage ass possible, shift into human only when needed to heal while applying dots, before form either kiting or changing to bear to interrupt/tank if needed, back to feral if dont need to kite and specced into all ferals damage etc.
---
Bla bla bla
---
I will be maining dwarf rogue myself.
---
Thank you.
---
Spitballing here: If a mob dual-wields it's *probably* worth it?
---
Now that I think about it, there's not any boss level mobs that do that in Classic.
---
Play what you want and play what will fit your goals in the game. If you're a casual it doesn't matter, just have fun. 
---
But if you do want to be top of your class hardcore min-maxer you better believe you follow the meta.
---
A lot of people have more fun when they're playing the best that they can (playing to win), and it also means you clear more raid content and do it faster.
---
They didn't because people didn't exploit them like this.
---
They aren't.  
---
You can tank lvl 60 dungeons as arms/fury.  You can heal lvl 60 dungeons as feral/balance.  Shadow priests can heal lvl 60 dungeons.  
---
It only becomes an issue in raids, and even then you will still have DPS warriors with tank sets used as off tanks.
---
But Crescent Staff

[Ayle](http://twitch.tv/aylegaming) and [TMB](https://www.twitch.tv/its_tmb) are smaller Shaman streamers who are active in the classic Shaman discord and would be willing to answer questions.

Here is the github repo with an alpha build: https://github.com/fusionpit/TalentSequence
---
Are you for real? My comment about flask and dwrafs was OBVIOUS sarcastic. Are you really that dumb? World Buffs are part of Vanilla and it will be part of Classic. The end.
---
Because it's fun.
---
You can heal as any spec with any class in any dungeon at max level.  So long as you have some gear to support it, you can get the job done. 
---
The vast majority of tanks you get in 5 mans wont even be specced tank anyway.
---
I’m on mobile and don’t want to bother with an imgur account/ logging into reddit. 
---
I didn’t that’s the point. Shits going through grounding that shouldn’t.
---
Why would I make a fraud thread? This is not a throwaway.
---
I don't stream yet but if you want to chat about Priests that pretty much all I played from Launch until I quit right before WOTLK. When the game launches I'll be streaming my Priest gameplay though :)
---
Very nice. Looking forward to using this in Classic.
---
OP: "Statement."
---
Reddit: "OMG so true! +60 upvotes."
---
Commenter: "I agree."
---
Reddit: "OMG ur wrong idiot! -7 upvotes."
---
No one cares about you either, white knight.
---
Neat. Thanks mate
---
Take my upvote, thanks for the chuckle
---
I have an even better spec:
---
Wing clip spam.
---
You can still heal just fine at 60 as a DPS spec, so long as you have some gear to support it, which everyone will at that stage.  
---
For shadow priests specifically, you have no issues healing any pre raid content; you just don't have tools to make up for a full group of bad players.
---
Pretty much my mentality going into Vanilla. Having fun. I work a full time job. I can't be top tier unless I literally have no life and take excessive amounts of time off of work. When I was 13 that was perfectly fine, not so much anymore lol
---
Priests are the most versatile heale you will have to use multiple ranks of your 2 main heals and your hot. Druids have several hots and a slow heal of whitch you use several ranks. Shamasn is ok if you are tank healing. But braindead if you are raid healing.
---
By the logic set forth in the video; meeting the criteria. AddOns are exploitative in nature. Maybe a video on that next?
---
I implore everyone to watch the full video, he brings up a lot of good points.
---
And I played on a private server that wiped world buffs upon entering a raid for the first month of the raids release, and it relieved a lot of stress and the progression relied on how good your guild was, not just who was able to zone in and steamroll everything with full world buffs first.
---
And with no world buffs, every raid was still cleared Day 1 by the top guild(s). But after a month all the shitty guilds get a crutch to help them with content they would never get through without the buffs.
---
Good thing reddit comments are editable, huh?
---
&gt;bla bla bla
---
Quit talking like anybody cares about you loool
---
&gt; You can't sabotage a guilds ability to farm gold for flasks. 
---
Omg what a stupid comment. You can for foks sake camp the spawns and take all BL if you want. Is that an exploit? No. Is world buffs an exploit? No.
---
Fair enough. I liked the ideas but I also hope that if classic+ ever happened then Blizzard would slow down with raids and focus more for new quests and other challenges that benefit more people but they would not ignore the raiding community either. Organizing 40 men to show up at the same time would be limiting factor and leave most classic players away from that content patch. I'm actually more of a fan fot new dungeons as it's more accessible for most players. Another thing I've always liked is heroic dungeons (overall harder dungeons but I I'd still prefer not overwhelming rewards: no gear upgrades, just running it for the sake of challenge)
---
Yea, the video was moronic to say the least.
---
A huge part of early WoW's charm was the human element and competitive atmosphere.  
---
Bottom line is that guilds back in vanilla rarely even tried to get more than a single buff going into a raid, because it was so inconsistent trying to secure a turn in at raid time.  If a guild wants to start at the break of dawn the second day of raiding to turn in some quest items... then more power to them I say.
---
They're probably not really defending but rather hunting solo or in small groups for more honor by killing enemies away from the raid so the honor gets split less.
---
Actually defending can end up in a turtle round and hurting their honor/hour.
---
why are all the middle-aged people caring about people that want to be the best
---
no one cares that ur old stubby fingers can't do what younger players are trying to do and become lmao
---
I'm maining Feral Dps and my first alt will be Enhancement :)
---
If done correctly with healing assignments it is basically just flash of light spam this is correct. However I find it so much fun I rolled hpala in vanilla and on nost. Hpala in PvP is where I have the most fun, find a big strong 2h warrior and go shred faces it basically takes 4-5 people to bring the two of down once your in bwl gear. Mages just cry because BOF just breaks the game and if your lucky enough to have a priest friend to purge all there stupid shields gg
---
Forgive me if I’m wrong but isn’t this a repost? I definitely saw this posted before.
---
I don’t know why you’d try to fake it, I’m just saying this isn’t conclusive. You should get a video of the evidence,  then we’d know that there is for sure an issue. Like it’s good that you’re bringing attention to the potential issue but we don’t really know that there’s for sure something wrong unless you’re uploading concrete proof.
---
Also you don’t need an imgur account to upload an image, it’s as simple as going to your screenshots folder, copying the image then going to Imgur and hitting create a post and pasting.
---
Okay? Which has nothing to do with what I said. Dude above me said people in the beta were shitting on AV because AV is actually bad. That isn't the case.
---
My favorite part of this post is ret is so far gone that it doesn't even get fucked. Poor ret :,(
---
Going only on memory, but I'm pretty sure you could queue as low as 51.
---
Has there ever been a hunter agree to do this shit?
---
What are the differences in how world buffs work on private servers vs how they worked in vanilla?
---
And now optimal players clear content in green gear because people like you are gone.
---
The major inflationary events in Wow history have been Xpacs when new quest zone with new items with higher vendor values were dumped onto the market. 
---
A large portion of 'farming' (ie any gathering) is not actually creating new wealth it's redistributing it amongst players. The only exception here is when you vendor new items. In my experience, the majority of people grinding gold are looking for consumables to sell to other players which is not inflationary
---
We saw inflation problems on some private servers with extremely large populations. 
---
After nearly 3 years of vanilla the wow servers had experienced some minor inflationary creep. That changed dramatically within a few months of TBC. 
---
In my opinion the talk of inflationary problems is totally overblown and not well understood.
---
cd
---
I think you’re in the wrong sub lad
---
You do realize that no guild with half a brain would actually post pone starting times just to secure a world buff, right?  
---
Every random casual guild out there is going to randomly having people turning in ony's head at any random time.  Most guilds wont be trying to coordinate 'turn in times' for nefs head or other things, because most guilds on a server tend to start raiding around the same times to begin with. 
---
This is a non issue, and any insult coming your way and showing why private server players need to shut the crap up are very welcome in my mind.  It is insane how many people claim they played back then and then somehow make these idiotic claims that world buffs were exploited on the regular.
---
Yeah that’s a shit guarantee.. if 15m people sub for classic they won’t release that
---
Yes, it legitimately hurts my eyes bad to look at it.
---
This is an actual thing that needs to be fixed.
---
You need a new computer for sure man! Doesn't have to be filthy with all the bells and whistles but look up the recommended specs for retail. It's a little less than those essentially.
---
Have you ever been walking anywhere, saw somebody else is walking the same place, and got weirdly competitive about who gets there first? Maybe you try to turn the corners a little tighter to shave off microseconds?
---
I don't know how anybody could think that blink is not useful.
---
People getting cc'd with grounding up because they activated grounding too late is blizzlike and has been a thing forever. I would assume this is similar.
---
The topic was on pvp (3 months ago) and you're giving a PVE reply.
---
So, you made claims of this. Which you made other various claims without any sources. Where is the source showing that they made this capped at level 63 so guilds wouldn't stack the buffs? Perhaps they didn't want people visiting old content because they made a completely new game for the players? You know, like they've done with every expansion pack. Or maybe this change was in direct relation to what they would have seen. Who knows, but claiming that was the reason with no proof is rather dubious.
---
Nah man, Vael was pre a lot of class rebuilds if you go back and look. A ton of classes got their re-work which made killing Vael a lot easier later in vanilla than in the beginning when it was new. People will rofl stomp vael with 1.12 threat and talents. Thats just facts.
---
You think they were exploited, but they weren't.  Not even nilhilum would post pone raids just to push naxx runs with world buffs.. the odds of them securing those suckers were nearly impossible and it was more worth while just getting into the frickin raid and playing the game than it would have been to wait 1-2 hours for a turn in. 
---
Absolute insanity that video is, and screams "I didn't play vanilla, but I have played on pservers for 10 years".
---
I watched Madseasons stream last night, his first game was rushed to completion with both sides just running past each other. Didnt seem that hard. A lot of games are being turtled right now because no one cares about the rewards on temporary characters and just want to fight.
---
Paladin/Warrior are a couple tiers above everything else on that list.
---
Very well done.
---
I'd say warlock Paladin. Phase 1 feral druid is not going to be easy to gear and even though warrior paladin would be great in pvp, you'll probably want a lot of the same gear from dungeon runs.
---
As stand alone features I dont think they would be so bad. Its the teleporting that goes with it that made the world seem so small.
---
None used warriors the way they are used on private servers. I for one hope blizzard removes them from raids we don't need to make pve content any easier.
---
Time well spent friend.
---
Kalimalimdor, and Essos.
---
Must be an alliance thing. Orcs face got like 3 polygons in classic
---
Frankly, depending on the offspec, I'd chose a fully committed (lets say) enh shaman that comes fully fed, potted and oiled up with an clear eye on bid gear and progress than a half assed more 'accepted spec.
---
Ok thanks, that is only for the ony buff? What about the other buffs?
---
Dunno how they can do it but for me personally I’m waiting till it’s officially out so I can enjoy it in full and permanently.
---
I'm impressed. What are the basics to get started making addons? How long would it take to get into if you didn't have a background in programming?
---
aspect of the pack: ON, ALWAYS, EVERY MOMENT OF THE DAY, falls off in a raid? DON'T WORRY PACK'S BACK ON BABY
---
Eh, if they alter vanilla then that is it for me.  These aren't the old developers of the game, and it certainly isn't the same Blizzard anymore.  
---
Even if post naxx content could end up better than TBC in theory; what are the odds?  
---
There is only one absolute for me, and that is I can have fun in TBC despite some of its cons, but I have no idea what changing vanilla to the core would be like, and it is a risk.  If I wanted a risk then I would just stick to retail.
---
Just the price of the spells and thinking about buying the mount at 40 is kickin' muh' triggers!
---
I'm gonna get a pet on my hunter and just get wing clip, concussion, mend pet, and arcane to 40 and use shit ammo lol
---
imo that's a much worse solution. I'd much rather them be able to dynamically update and balance layers as they remove them instead of being forced into merging X servers to try and balance populations.
---
Also keep in mind their main problem is the initial launch cluster and making that playable. If they have 15k pop servers, hope they get down to 4k but some of them only get down to 7k when they remove layering that's not really a big problem as once people are spread out after a few weeks the biggest issue won't exist
---
Shammy is the best for burst damage.
---
You are thinking of Tremor Totem.
---
Absolutely the best level 20 mobility spell. Blink? Aspect of the Cheetah? Cat Form? Pshh. Ghost Wolf is basically mount 0.5 and it's usable in combat.
---
Yeah, Travel Form is better, but Druids don't get that until level 30.
---
Even when I played in Cata the world PvP was decent. I was just lucky enough to be on a server that seemed to promote it. There were a few guilds on each side and we hunted for each other all the time. Of course fishing tourneys were also a big draw for the world PvP crowd. I dont think battlemasters and cross realm will ruin that. 
---
Low que BGs will be great, but its not gonna stop me from world PvP. No way.
---
The original manual also says you lose xp on death.
---
no it won't run at all, that thing is ancient
---
Wowwiki has a list of all launched servers and dates. It looks about 60(pve)/40(pvp) for vanilla and seems to shift heavily towards pve by wotlk. I’d assume flying attributes a lot to that since it makes world pvp pretty boring. 
---
For me personally world pvp lost its novelty even in classic. The majority of it is griefing which isn’t exactly good gameplay.
---
You mean investors would hold it against them... thanks for highlighting the video game industry's biggest problem right now.
---
Yeah I think I added too many raids, many of the 20 men raids should be dungeons
---
Heroic mode doesn't belong in classic in my opinion, unless you only mean "harder" dungeons and not a toggle mode
---
Even if they release numbers, they wont differentiate between what BFA has and what classic has.  They would likely just mix them and make it seem like their cash cow retail is as big as ever, just to sell expansions.
---
Except he points out that world buffs weren't widely used in this manner (stacking them up for 30-60% stronger performance) in vanilla times, even for top guilds.   This wasn't part of the vanilla experience, and it has a hugely negative impact on the game.  Player behavior has to be part of the equation.  In situations where a change in player behavior between vanilla and classic leads to a significant difference in the way the game plays, the standard for whether to adjust the game should be blizzard asking themselves "if this behavior was going on during vanilla, do we think it would have been fixed?".   
---
If the Paladin trick to 1 shot Kazzak wasn't discovered until on a private server, do you think Blizzard should just let it go on Classic?  Hell no.   That would be a stupidly dogmatic way to look at #NoChanges.  No changes should be about more than just the code that the game runs on.  You have to take player behavior into account to some degree.
---
You are right, my bad, I have no proof of the cause. I have changed my comment to reflect that.
---
No worries, good man.
---
Well this resolved quite nicely, good day to you :D
---
Not really. Anyone can be the Winter's Chill Mage. If you quit, there would be a Mage in 2 seconds who would respec.
---
It's why no one wants to be that. Either you get loot before the higher DPS Mage's, or you don't.
---
It's purely evaluating WHO benefits most from the gear. And the pure specced DPS Mage's will get prio over you, the sacrificial lamb Mage. Sure, EVENTUALLY you'll get geared, but only after the other 6 Mage's are.
---
LOL. I was gonna post something similar but this is great
---
If world PvP became better for honor then they'd just make raids to grind each other in a zone in the world. You wouldn't get organic random encounters that matter for ranking either way.
---
My mana is crying reading this
---
It takes me almost no effort to min max my character. This game is over a decade old and hasn't changed THAT much. If you've been subbed half of the time between release and now, you should min max yourself by default without even trying. If you can't then you're doing it wrong.
---
Stop speaking logic.  
---
People have so much misplaced faith in a company that has already screwed us over many, many times already.
---
My suspicion is that the majority of the "no cross realm crowd" are people that exclusively do premades.
---
Saying "Shedo *even* tops DPS charts as feral in raids" does not make this a PvE reply. Lol. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVymmQyFNVc&amp;t=337s
---
Your comment is top 5 of the most retarded comments I have seen in this subreddit. "Exploiting buffs", lol.
---
Dude, arena wasn't even ready when TBC was released...
---
No healer is using one button paladins especially late game can get away with using max rank healing so they tend to use 2. Shamans raidhealing normally spam heal chainheal rank 1 and max rank after raid wide damage. Priests and druids need to use 2-3 ranks of there mainheals and max rank hots
---
Casuals are secretly jealous and want the rewards without the effort.
---
Min maxers ignore them and don't care they.
---
You can't beat rogue.  You can easily catch people off guard while they are fighting something, proceed to keep them stunlocked for a while, and just finish them off.
---
how dare you
---
Spell batching would make you able to cast Fire Blast despite being stunned, the exact opposite of what happened in that clip. He actually got his instant cast effectively interrupted because it took his connection so long to inform the server that he was already stunned when it received the command, blocking the spell cast. Spell batching is also not nearly enough to explain how long that rogue kept moving. He kept moving for almost a full second after being hit, far more than even the maximum of 0.4s from spell batching would allow.
---
The only thing for which spell batching is a valid explanation is the blink.
---
I agree with both of you 100%. 
---
Robin is the mvp of the meme
---
There's a lot of info at https://wow.gamepedia.com/World_of_Warcraft_API and https://www.wowinterface.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=8, among other places on the web.  If you don't have a background in coding, a lot of things will probably be overwhelming.
---
You can start with a general LUA tutorial, like http://luatut.com/ to see if it makes sense to you.
---
Don't you think we could keep standard classic servers and have optional  classic+ servers ? And maybe even TBC servers at the same time ?
---
 I think the WoW community is big enough that splitting the community wouldn't do much harm, you will still have millions of players on each version and that is more than enough. Actually  keeping classic stagnant would probably hurt the vanilla community more.
---
And to you too.
---
I made an addon to add this ingame: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c153f0/inspired_by_ucompletely_appalleds_site_which/?
---
This finna get deleted.
---
I really like the idea of world buffs going away when you enter a raid instance
---
If they aren’t in the beta why would they quit already
---
Oh sorry. Sir, I do so believe the idea that kiting, the concept of a ranged character moving in tandem with synergy of their resources like stuns and slows to keep melee characters in range, to be, in a sequentially formed organizational pattern, the lesser of the difference between the difficulty of kiting and keeping up with ranged characters.
---
Happy? I had to stick my nose up for you, I get that reddit is above twitch and all, according to you.
---
I was joking, but evidently nobody here is able to grasp basic mage jokes. I figured that blink bugs was such a low hanging fruit that I wouldn't have to include the /s.
---
Aquatic form, hello??
---
Soft times breed soft men.
---
Guilds used world buffs since BWL so blizzard was aware of it.
---
This existed but not sure about vanilla because I was horde.
---
You got him mixed up with everyone involved with nostalrius
---
Wait why not just tame a cat in the first place? How do pet abilities work in classic?
---
Glad you have the patience to deal with that idiot. I wasn't even going to reply to that nonsense lol.
---
Then you have very special needs.  For instance, one of the buffs is songflower, which is only supposed to buff one person.  But they use 1 flower to buff an entire raid.
---
There are a lot of ways to show your support for Classic in retail, if you don’t have the beta:
---
* farm your Tier 1 - Tier 3 transmog for every classic class
---
* delete your Monk, DK and DH alts
---
* make hateful comments to players leveling Allied Race characters. Let them know they don’t belong here
---
I’m sure there are others...
---
There is also that quest with a dwarf in a toilet from vanilla to get a him silk cloth to wipe his ass.
---
I noticed on this sub that some people like to complain about others that like to play the game as optimally as they can, instead of just ignoring what others do and go about their way. But they just dont seem to understand that certain people like to minmax and speedrun stuff whether its needed or required to. Nobody really cares if you don't need to fully optimize the way you play, just so happens to be different people have different opinions on how to play a game.
---
Huh weird how that works out..
---
I jump on from time to time but I feel that it doesn't quite scratch the itch.  For me it's better than playing on BfA live servers but it's hard to be motivated to do anything meaningful.
---
I swapped from Warrior to Hunter during Vanilla because my casual guild was running with about 12-18 warriors a raid and only 2-4 hunters.  There's tons of hunters in wow, but most are huntards and not capable of raiding successfully.  Which means if you're one of the few hunters who knows what the fuck they're doing raid slots are easy to come by.
---
In the incel thought-bubble, the only reason anyone is against misogyny is because they are "white knights" who think serving women will get them laid. They think everyone except the white knights hate women.
---
The idea that someone could be against misogyny because it's bad for women, bad for men and stinks up the internet is beyond them.
---
If you really didn't care you wouldn't be posting. Obviously you do care a lot about female streamers, and so do all the people upvoting you for announcing that you don't care.
---
We all have different opinions. I choose to keep them as opinions, you attempt to declare yours as fact
---
Just the CD on Onyxia’s head. Everything else works exactly the same. Private servers removed the CD so it would be an even playing field.
---
huh
---
I really don't like summit... BUT... This i can agree with him on. Just play what ever at the end of the day makes you fucking happy. There are gonna be tons of guilds that will take you just because you show up on time for the raid regardless of your spec/class. As long as you show up and bring your A game most guilds won't care.
---
smol brain take
---
That last paragraph doesn’t seem accurate. 
---
I’m not a mathematician, but if base run speed is 100 units/sec, it’s worth mounting up if you’re running more than 8.625 seconds. This is because in that amount of time, you would run 862.5 units, while you’ll run the same distance in 5.625 seconds on a 160% speed mount (with a 3 second cast speed.
---
Invisibility pots are your friend.  I suggest everyone keep a few in their bags.  Almost impossible to camp someone using them.
---
There are a timer on warlords but that's it. The other buffs can easily be stacked ahed of time and saved through logging off and not playing your character until raid start
---
Multibox it
---
They weren't as much abused as they are now tho and it wasn't common only very few top world guilds would use them.
---
The first raid tiers defnitely aren't balanced around world buff, maybe AQ and mostly Naxx are but not BWL/MC
---
Yeah my guild had DM buffs and dragon head buffs every raid back in BWL.
---
Hmm. That’s interesting. Guess major domo won’t drop loot during phase 1. That’s interesting.
---
I like the private server rule: no world buffs for the first month of a new raid.
---
I always used them for leveling or PvP.  Kind of dumb to have them help raids.
---
Sounds to me like you're a private server player, have you considered the possibility what's true on private servers isn't true in classic?
---
Private servers got a lot of shit wrong after all.
---
Salty shamans with CoT. A pure Classic.
---
Not enough to affect routing.
---
Progression looses purpose.
---
I totally agree. Back in Vanilla I didn't use AddOns, but I would often consult websites such as Wowhead for quest help. Today I use a lot of AddOns and I agree that they give an unfair advantage over non AddOn users. Would be interesting to see more of these "exploits" discussed by the community.
---
Well most people are playing on Pservers rn.
---
Have you often considered that the nost core information on how they guestimated the values for the game ( which blizzard also lost) was obtained by blizzard to help out with the release of classic.
---
Private servers did get a lot of things right after all.
---
I think deep down mpst people would agree that slight buffs to weaker classes would be a boon to just about everyone(variety is great). But then u have purists who beyond all reason want everything EXACTLY the same.
---
You’ve convinced me to roll female dwarf 👍
---
Man sooooo smooth! I remember I would average about 20-30 FPS back then. Was so jealous of my buddy who had 256MB of video memory while I had 128MB. Time’s sure have and have not changed.
---
People in this subreddit are so touchy that they cant take a joke without going bananas on the dislike button.
---
Yup!
---
I just ripped all my boxes to shreds a like a savage
---
After he helped me I would have killed him LOL
---
So I guess only Blizzard employees can have opinions on their games lol
---
Stop it or you're gonna make me reroll (in my head) frost mage from warrior.
---
Samantha Swifthoof in STV is where Taurens were supposed to learn Plainsrunning, but then Blizzard added Kodo mounts at the last second and never removed Samantha Swifthoof who now serves no purpose.
---
Yeah I was like wtf reading that lol
---
Is this addon for making your talent build in the addon then it applies it in your actual tree?
---
Nope
---
I didn't even know about that, and raids still get cleared within hours ? Damn classic is gonna get steamrolled even harder than I tought.
---
Dwarf Mage got scrapped at the last second. The Blink spell icon is a Dwarf Mage Blinking.
---
I think it’s more due to the lack of personal interaction
---
Never heard of that, but yea, that's an interesting way to deal with it. Should even the playing field for all guilds on content release.
---
You'll have a blast healing. I didn't heal in vanilla but i healed from bc-cata on every heal class but druid. And your question about pvp, you'll honestly have more fun as a holy pally in pvp because you're an unkillable object if geared. And no class is really sustainable with hopping specs other than a mage imo because they can aoe farm so well and sell portals for ez gold. But if you get a nice tank/holy set and find zones to aoe farm at, you could get decent golds to respec here and there but its not something you want to do all the time because respec caps at 50 gold and doesn't go down for like a month or so.
---
If there are RP-PvP servers being released, then why not roll on a server like that and get the best of both worlds?
---
I think the majority of people here are going to roll on a PvP server as evident by the surveys so as a proxy my view of PvP servers is similar to the faction imbalance on retail right now, it’s going to be way easier to find people (specifically people who aren’t smoothbrains) on a PvP server to enjoy content with, just like how it’s easier to find people on horde on retail to do higher mythic+s or find a mythic guild
---
&gt;You can heal as any spec with any class in any dungeon at max level.
---
Finally! I can now fulfill my dream of being a warrior healer. I can't wait to apply all those bandages.
---
CoT is the absolute worst
---
Pre-Raid, you take what you can get,  
---
in MC, you are aiming to get Benediction/Anathema, (though you might be under priority vs healing priests)  
---
This will last you until about Nefarian, where you can get Lok'amir (Mace), but you'll probably be under priority vs shams and pallys.  
---
This will continue with naxx staves and maces.
---
I’m not. That’s a dispel, not a grounding effect.
---
No, my argument has remained the same:
---
&gt; It only increases your stealth level by 1 (equal to 1 point in MoD) when using the active and standing still.
---
Which is still true and is easily tested in the Beta, which it has been.
---
Nope. That’s a dispel not a grounding (immunity) effect.
---
I’m still raiding Naxx till Classic release. Don’t have anything better to do.
---
I think there will be addons that track the cooldown of the world buffs on the server.
---
They are releasing a fresh server on June 22nd that has all content released on day one. So it will test guilds on completing Naxx with the least amount of gear possible.
---
They’ve already said they won’t release rp-pvp servers at launch. ☹️ But with the rest I think I agree. I hate the toxic culture found on a lot of pvp servers but that tends to be where the better players flock...
---
You create the talent tree (and order) on https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/, then copy and paste the link into the addon.  You are then able to click the unlearned talent icons to learn that talent next, or just use it as a guide to fill out the talent tree normally.
---
What do you suppose the internal number was for how many new subs coming back for classic makes it a break even?
---

&gt; they use 1 flower to buff an entire raid
---
Thats blizzlike and raids did that in Vanilla all the time. Its part of the Vanilla experience.
---
Cool but for lazy people. Takes 2 seconds to pull up a page online without having to add another addon to your list.
---
I do remember when xrealm bg came out I loved it. It au is doing 4 or 5 ab in a row and getting stomped in 5 mins. Thinking next one hopefully will be fun.
---
That's just when premade are grinding but it was a lot
---
Duo DM for world buffs (and gold/disenchanting) with guild officers so they don't need to roll engineering to solo it.
---
and allies get more priest and... a 4th rogue instead of a 3rd mage
---
It's a fucking exploit.  It might not even work in classic due to the servers being faster.  People didn't do that shit in vanilla.  People had some fucking decency back then.  They didn't use cheats, because they knew it would cheapen the experience and sense of accomplishment.
---
Alright that’s useful thanks I’ll be using that!
---
This sort if collusion between factions is not acceptable.
---
Yeah they removed it before beta ended. In the lore it makes sense for them not to be mages. They don't really care for the mystical, and only some care about the Divine because of their long friendship with Humans. 
---
Of course this is Vanilla/Pre Vanilla stuff. Once you hit the Legion era version of Pre Vanilla lore it would make sense for them to be mages if they wanted.
---
Everyone was in green gear (and some blues) then too.
---
Hunters are great at ganking. You can track dudes from a distance, have a cat, and hell pop an invis potion if you don't want to be an elf. Plus, if you catch a melee class offguard you've basically already won.
---
"objectively" huh? By what metric? Your opinion?
---
How often are you planning on ganking? If the answer is "Once every 3 minutes" or less, I'd make an argument for 3 Minute Mage as the best ganker.
---
If more, then Rogue or Druid are the best. Warlocks can compete as well though, especially if it turns into a 1v2 against you.
---
Shadow Priest is funniest though. Mind Control off a cliff/elevator/boat is 11/10 gameplay.
---
Hunters have been the worst ganks on me so far. By the time you're aware of them, [you're already dead](https://pics.me.me/omae-wa-mou-shindeiru-36135735.png).
---
Blink is about 99% of the reason I moaned mage from bc to wod.
---
honestly, you can multibox a 40-man raid of legolas name variants with each of the accounts having a full server roster of name variants taken on multiple servers... and people will still use this name both ironically and unironically as if it was never chosen yet.
---
I still have an unbound oldschool Frostsaber on Alliance Worthmale server.  
---
I was so excited to ride it, and then I quit.
---
You are so easily offended. Do you need a safe space?
---
Oh, so the whiney cry babies on the official forums were the majority and spoke for everyone huh?
---
Username checks out alright
---
In old vanilla, it was surprisingly easy to disrupt the rush.
---
I would just back-cap towers and Graveyards. People often didn't defend and then they had a few deaths(which sent people all the way back to their base). Soon enough, it was a turtle.
---
Be careful they'll leave the comfort of his nutsack to flame you.
---
I can't tell if you're making a joke or not but the phrase is "moot point"
---
This is the correct way to play. None of filthy collusion between factions
---
It was a hunter against the rogue group with the Corehound tooth.
---
There were only 2-3 locks and we just wanted to screw over the 10 mages in our group because we were always passed over loot because we couldn't cast spells and the frozen/ignite debuff was too strong for us to stand out
---
Honestly no. I would like to see Ret being a decent dps spec, fury shouldn't be gods, and there should be other tanks besides protection warrior for raids. I understand the #nochanges crowd but ffs you really want to play the same game for years and years? If Blizzard were to only do anything I would love for them to bring other specs up to par with the main ones we always are going to see in classic.
---
But the damnage...
---
Facts my ass...  You are just making excuses for abusing an exploit to trivialize otherwise trivial content.  It's fucking sad and pathetic.  
---
PS:  You are the one raging too.   You already deleted your trash post full of vitriol.  Again, sad and pathetic.
---
Pig tails be whippin
---
Same. Had vanilla to I believe Cata? I think after cata is when I started going digital which I also regret. 
---
I also had 3-4 of the action figures they made back in BC I believe? Kept them in the box for a while. As the dumb kid I am I opened them and now have no idea where they went. 
---
Worth 100-200 each now.
---
You are. And you're home now.
---
The circlejerk around here is that retail WoW is total faceroll and you can just round up a million mobs and AoE them.
---
Maybe that was true at some point, but I derped around a bit on retail with a level 12ish monk and it was vanilla-like in that I could beat one mob, two was close, and if I got three I had to run away or die. I think that most of the people here expressing strong opinions about how easy BFA is are repeating stories they have heard that have grown in the telling, and do not have any up-to-date first hand knowledge.
---
This is sickening
---
!thesaurizethis
---
Is this a haiku or what
---
I think that the biggest differences would be mob spawn rates, drop rates, patrolling patterns, and combat behaviors.
---
Here is a Vanilla raid clicking songflower: https://m.imgur.com/QYlJuqG
---
I never said it didn't happen snowflake.
---
Druid is under powered in vanilla if you play feral. Hybrid is necessary to excel at Druid. However if as a Druid you do this y’all can world pvp like no other. 
---
Warrior and paladin is the super star team combo in vanilla. Both Tanky and blessing of freedom on warrior for unlimited movement. If pally is pocket heals and support you guys can absolutely dominate.
---
I can't unsee this in my brain.
---
What does 'felt like an RPG' even mean? What is a 'regular RPG'?
---
What does travel time or difficult mobs have to do with RPGs?
---
This is the only time where level 30 or level 40 metas are going to happen.
---
Its interesting seeing whats most efficient with current restrictions.
---
No problem, see you in Azeroth!
---
Here is the problem. No one USED to care. Some still won’t but this is a new generation of player...
---
You liberals are always so easily triggered.
---
I can feel the Cheeto dust from your angry breathing.
---
RP wise rogues aren't stealthy.
---
This sub: If you play PVP and DO NOT roll an Orc if your class can play an Orc you are USELESS and deserve to be KICKED from the battleground and blacklisted from the server until you correct your error and start over as an orc from level 1.
---
Thing is you qualify everything you say as true, throughout this whole thread.
---
It's the typical private server arrogance and elitism we've come to expect on this forum. You might full well be utterly wrong, but you're never going to acknowledge that fact even now after we've found out private servers have gotten a lot things wrong.
---
Dude. Blizzard has an actual classic server running, they do not *need* the nost data though I'm sure it's been useful.
---
Feels more like sneaking. The game was slower.
---
Honestly, invisibility pots will be especially useful when people thing you just noped out of the layer to escape the ambush.
---
Or if OP killed him using his new tamed pet
---
Ahhh Blackrock and BG9... infamous
---
Is there an easy way to download spreadsheets from there?
---
Dont kid yourselves.  Warrior+Paladin is the only choice for you neck beards.
---
I didn't even consider that thats why Darn/TB are 30. I just thought it was kind of arbitrary. Thats actually pretty cool

Kinda does. If you start from nothing ita supposed to you to be hard to kill mobs. Youre supposed to walk until u can have your mount. You have to ask for help to others to achieve the same goals. Seems like an RPG to me. Modern wow is mostly single playing tbh. You queue with people you dont even have to talk with
---
it will be expensive to re-license the actors that appeared in them, vs just making some random high up blizzard dev voice a quick 5-15 second twitch pre-roll.
---
Blink was the reason I mained a mage all of classic
---
OMG i remembered the poop as soon as i saw this!
---
Omg dude IT WAS SARCASM.
---
nice try Daniel
---
Gonna ask you then. This time around I think I'm gonna go Shadow priest. Not looking to heal to be honest, unless my guilds in a pinch and needs it. And the only way I will, is if I can still prioritize DPS gear and not healing. I know no hardcore guild will take a spriest besides maybe 1 hardcore player.
---
I'll mostly join a casual guild. Do you think this is realistic? If So, for Mana - is it actually manageable? I've tested it on a Pserver and it literally seems like a Spriest goes oom in 20 seconds. Are Mana pots actually able to sustain, and if so, are they expensive? I played Rogue in Vanilla so I've never dealt with pots.
---
*nervously glances at steam collection*
---
I've not played a private server before, so I've actually been playing it 100% more lately than ever before. I'm taking every class to 30 to nail down my main.
---
The thing that really fucks campers on invisibility pots is they're not ready for it.  There's a certain search pastern used for catching a stealthed rogue or druid, but when a warrior/mage/etc pops one, people spread out in all the wrong directions looking in the wrong way.  I typically switch directions as soon as a pop it and people run completely the wrong way nine times out ten.
---
I have played plenty of RPGs that don't have difficult mobs or long travel time.
---
And what does queuing have to do with making it not an RPG?
---
Yes, if Blizzard commits to protecting the classic model, and making future expansions.
---
&gt;The second is that the reasons don't matter. The result is what the playbase has to contend with.
---
Precisely this. I could give less of a rat's ass for the *why* of any of Blizzard's decisions. I'm sure they have tons of good rationalizations for all the changes they've made to retail over the years, but that doesn't matter. The end result is a game I don't want to play.
---
The only thing druid has over rogue is human tracker and travel form to give chase, this can make it harder to escape a druids second kill than a rogue, but rogue is still the most brutal upfront by a factor of 10 lol.
---
I don't think they'll be shocked, they see the numbers and know how the game is doing currently.
---
I do think that classic will massively boost their subscriptions though.
---
Plus each level cap provides a new brief meta where they farm that levels bis and have tournies, looks cool but I am not fussed, I'm looking forward to playing from scratch
---
They're only going to ever release numbers if it gets back up to their glory days, and its unlikely that they go back up to 10 million. Even then they might not release that information
---
It wasn't that they lost the code. They have the 1.12 code, and they are running it internally to test bug reports against. What Omar did was create a solution that allowed the old data to be used by the newer code.
---
The reason that classic was considered unviable before Omar's hack is that they can't release a game with 15-year-old architecture, it would be full of performance issues and vulnerabilities. The amount of work to get that 15-year-old architecture to a point where they could be confident in it would be massive and not financially viable. So, are they "fudging" Classic? Sure, you could say that. But that is the only reasonable option they have other than not doing Classic at all.
---
Yes! If I'm out questing and get a polite whisper asking if I can tank for a dungeon and I have time, I'm probably going.
---
If I get a ninja invite, it's an automatic decline.
---
Because by queuing you dont have to find them by yourself. Which is another RPG element imo
---
I guess it depends on youre idea of RPG. Think we just have different ideas on what makes an RPG good
---
The first week of classic there will probably be more people playing classic than BFA. Every week after that classic will decline until it evens out.
---
I don't think they're gonna be shocked at all. They wouldn't have bothered with this project at all if they weren't expecting millions to try it.
---
In general the more stupid you look the better the race is for PvP.
---
I'll second yours and throw in a huzzah for Louis Pasteur.
---
ok but how do you have 2.5g at 20? lol
---
Idk man... I used to think like that too, but when you see games like Old School Runescape that nowadays have triple the amount of people on the main game, classic actually might be like that aswell. 
---
We'll see
---
It will def bring subs up but i dont fully beleive it will surpass retail as retail holds alot of competive player content like raid world firsts, rank1 blizz con arena tournaments, mythic dungeon racing and what not were classic is 15year old content that has already been cleared classic, plus classic will stay as it is were retail will continue to evolve bring bew content no1 has seen.  
---
I personally will play classic as my main game but will return to retail for big patchs and new expansions but just remember wow has been a great game besides for a few things in some xpacs we didnt like
---
Any good set of useful macros that will work with Classic would be really awesome , I remember reading about very useful all in one Vanilla pet macros for example , but I'm not sure if they would work in Classic.
---
If a caster or healer pulls something off the tank you can send your pet after it and turn growl on once your pet grabs it you target a add next to the tank and turn growl off so the mob is next to the pack and the tank can grab aggro back.
---
In PVE, you'll hardly ever stance dance. You'll mostly stay in Berserker Stance if you're DPS, and Defensive Stance if you're a tank (one exception being Berserker Stance is necessary when you're expecting a fear). PVP is totally different; the more comfortable you are switching stances, the better your chances of success.
---
Oh my gawd thats beautiful cgi blizzard really went all out here ;)
---
Well, they sure did considering those were the voices they listened to. And ironic considering all you people are so fucking butthurt over people not liking that shitty battleground.
---
Makes me happy knowing you aren't getting your way. Enjoy 1.12 AV you whiny elitist fucks :)
---
In the early game, owls know level 2 claw but cats do not start off knowing claw.  You have a spell you get at level ten called "pet training" and you use it like a profession window to apply new spells/ranks of spells to your pet.
---
That doesnt work in classic, thats only a private server thing. Perplexity tested it in deadmines. Afaik mob tagging by players is not a viable strategy
---
Playing a pserver now in attemps to dristract myself it feels keep shitty and nasty i wish classic was out already pservers are always shit
---
That's heavy latency and desync issues, you can tell because seconds later the mage throws a grenade, and the rogue slides into place. 
---
The rogue is actually much closer than he appears on the mages client. 
---
Also, melee leeway doesn't affect gouge, it's a white attack thing, not abilities.
---
pet atk speed only matters in PVP the DPS is normalized.
---
Typical PvE player perspective... It's really unfortunate because if you ask anyone who plays on PvP servers, ganking is literally the last reason for playing there. It's a completely different game, and you do a disservice to your own people by saying they only play on PvE servers to avoid ganks. It's sad there are millions of people not experiencing the game because they are fooled to think this way.
---
My problem with mage, is that I want to gank in enemy zones, not neutral zones. Wouldnt it be difficult to sneak around and escape as a class that cant stealth at all?
---
Look up "Joanas Guide" and go to your desired starting zone, these are listed as for levels 1-12.  Once there, check the hunter class on the top left to see all the tips about hunter pet ability training.
---
Sadly you're right. Blizzard games in general are a Haven for angry neckbeards. Which is why I'm still on th fence about even playing classic WoW.
---
That is how it works in classic, the drop group strategy only works on private servers
---
Ahhh, I see you are neglecting to get every piece of +fire damage gear you can possibly get your hands on.  I refuse to upgrade any piece that has +fire with a piece that does not have a larger +fire number when levelling.  Who needs Int/Stam when it just makes you drink/eat longer.  
---
**PYRO HARD BIGGER NUMBERS BURN BABY BURN**
---
Oh yeah, glancing blows. I mean if you just meant increasing probability of hitting enemy by 3 %, it's still small increase and everything is based on RNG anyway to it statistically will improve your DPS but in one encounter or another it might not even show any difference. Such is nature of randomized elements. At least we are not playing Warhammer where even villager can one shot your badass character if he rerolls enough times lol
---
Former arena gods
---
9/10 cases of beta streamers complaining about feign trap not working is their own incompetence in the form of their pet attacking / getting attacked - which forces you back into combat
---
Even tryhard plague crime server hunter videos have hunters complaining about FD resists when it is not a resist but simply just their pet attacking bosses / players.
---
Old Gods confirmed
---
Is this loss?
---
Thank you for giving me something to downvote
---
But they used the Nost data... Not all of it, but even blizzard didn't know what was the proc of ironfoe. I know they did work with Nost to find out the answers to these questions. They mostly asked how they found the number they used for their servers. And came to an agreement.
---
Nonetheless, I was trying to point out that your claim has no holding. It isn't even relevant here. Just because a private server got information wrong it doesn't discredit what I'm saying. That would assume that my statement was obscure information. It is not, it is basic class knowledge you obtain after playing a class for 8 years on one version of the game. My statement was trying to prove that even Blizzard is currently guessing what it was like based upon already provided data from Nosts core. They could have took the values 1:1. or they could have altered it, to that degree we don't know. But the obvious information like the amount of damage a move does at lv 20 won't change. I leveled in the beta and nothing was different. in the point, I am providing.
---
Now I am not claiming private servers got everything right. But it is the typical retail player ignorance we've come to expect on this form for you to assume that from just a stereotype.
---
If your claim is I might be wrong, it is a weak one. You could also "might" be wrong. If I am wrong, that is incorrect as in this specific situation I am not.  If you were just pointing out to me because of I play private servers that information there was wrong. No shit. I know because I played on classic private servers sense cata every summer, and even before then as a curiosity. And ive been though it all, pre nost, nost shutdown, post shutdown. And even across multiple servers. Every server had different values for armor on bosses and bugs and stuff like that that i know is obv wrong. I even understand what things had to be guessed and can never be proven to be correct. 
---
But my claim, bears do more damage, can attack quicker after healing during your downtime, and have more isn't wrong as this is simply a case of x&gt;y. With the assumption that you are lv 20-25.
---
The only claim I have stated was that bears are better than cats at lv 20. Which is an objective fact. So id like to say everything I've said here is true, because that's the only claim I've said.
---
Melee leeway doesn't affect hunter's deadzone negatively, quite the opposite in fact it allows you to wingclip at larger range than melee range which indirectly makes your deadzone smaller, this is even more ridiculous on a tauren given that they have longer melee reach than any other race.
---
I believe a tauren hunter with leeway barely has a 1 yard deadzone, if that's not massive enough of a buff I don't know what is.
---
Yea I’ll just thank my two nut sacks for being ballr n raging nubs in Stv lul got gud
---
What I remember the most, aside from the same box, was looking at the login screen because my internet was so slow sometimes I would stay there for a solid 3 minutes, and also the patch screen when it was updating. Oh boy, I'm so ready do come back to this game.
---
Out of curiosity, is there a guide somewhere about how stats and weapons affect bear/cat paw damage?
---
you leveld from 1-12 and you are going to sit here and have a comment on 120 pvp not needing kiting in BFA.  
---
Great input man, keep it up
---
You won. Guess you deserve the raid spot as boomkin lol
---
No, thats my butthole.
---
I still have my vanilla CD-ROMs. Not sure why, just feels like a good thing to have lol
---
That somehow the back porting of the BFA client leads to some bugs they can't really solve properly. Like the hunter FD/combat pulse issue in beta for example or the spell batch being super long, etc
---
for the first month yes probably but how long they stay is the real question once the grind has set in.
---
I quit the day Classic was announced. Gave all of my gold away and have been patiently waiting since.
---
Same. Created the name for my first character and has been used for every reroll throughout the expansions and all games since
---
It's a time-honored world of warcraft tradition.
---
So you only made kids so they can take care of you when you are old?
---
Not the brightest plan, I gotta say
---
Classes (dps increased, threat gen increased, heal Mana costs decreased) and items (mostly level 58-60 dungeon drops) were buffed leading up to Naxx release in 1.11, making previous raid content easier.
---
didn't they already delete this thread once?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bz81gx/blizzard_deleting_threads_talking_about_difficulty/
---
The classes I enjoy the most are rogue and Spriest in classic. I played Rogue the first time around and all the way up til BFA. I want to start fresh as an Spriest. I fear leveling to 60, and having an extremely difficult time gearing and going OOM constantly in pve. Love the PvP gameplay though.
---
Melee leeway effectively makes hunter's deadzone smaller, which is a buff.
---
That clickbait title tho... zzzz
---
The problem is that some of you people are so toxic
---
Honestly back playing actual retail vanilla I never remember hearing the word "spell batching" or "melee leeway" ever, it's crazy how we've become so particular about these things to the point that I'm learning things about mechanics back in vanilla that I never even gave a second thought about, they were just there and I never even noticed.
---
&gt; Which is still true and is easily tested in the Beta, which it has been.   
---
Which you haven't shown.
---
I am so lazy I will spend hours creating this so I eventually not have to move my mouse as much as I would otherwise.
---
&gt; Never heard anyone suggest BM in vanilla for anything other than pvp    
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Yup cause it sucks. That dude is just rambling nonsense.  
---
pretty much. reason being that most raid specs already have 20 points into BM so a full bm spec would only net you a bw trimer and frenzy. While a pet's damage is nice to have when it has full raid buffs on it. It isn't the biggest force on your arsenal
---
&gt;  In vanilla hunters are ok in MC/BWL. They not so great in AQ, and by Naxx they suck.  
---
That goes for the Neandertal hunters who have not adapted beyond patch 1.5 (aka full range dps and 10 sec AiS rotations)
---
If they use the usual AiS melee dive or 4:3 rotations they pull their weight and coax out rogue tears on fight whereby their pets can be utilized permanently.
---
There is one grain of truth to the madmans rambling though and that's regarding spellpower. Not on your gear, but the 4:3 rotation can go with greater arcane and/or even flasks as they don't use AiS. Though from my conversations with horde hunters they don't have the mana to play it even with T3. So it was probably just an alliance thing.
---
FINALLY! new conjured water!
---
Same my dude! Census stats show Trolls will be only 20% of the Horde Priests. We're snowflakes
---
Only after zg is released. Game will have been out nearly a year by then 😢
---
and any decent damage meter couldn't be fooled by that post the very early versions of it in MC.
---
Escape Artist beats both
---
You have to turn off the ffx glow. I don’t have the command off hand but it fixes it. It’s from the legion client.

---
Just because I don't clip every single little thing that gets tested in the Beta doesn't make me wrong. If you did any amount of research beyond "look, Wowhead shows a passive buff, it must be true!" then you'd know you were wrong too.
---
Ah, that'd definitely make it difficult. In major cities, it's likely impossible.
---
Everywhere else... probably possible, but a lot harder. You'd need to rely on a mix of Invisibility Potions and pseudostealth (hiding inside bushes, behind trees, and in water) rather than an actual ability. Actually trying to stay in cover and out of sight, rather than walking around in the open.
---
You could also consider disguise gear or camoflage. The Orb of Deception would actually be useful here, as would items like the Savoury Deviate Delights. Even consider picking out an alternative gear set that matches the colours of the zone, to try and blend in. You're not trying to to trick the game, you're playing to the very fallible human on the other end.
---
Oh wow I never made that connection haha
---
it's the same subscription for both... hard to pass one if they are the same lol
---
I enjoy playing a healer so yay
---
their deadzone is still 3y. it just starts further away from them. In the harsh reality a medium sized entity hunter vs a tauren hunter had basically almost no dead zone between them as there were only 1,4y whereby they could not either hit or fire at each other. In TBC it got even more extreme with the matchup between draenei female and tauren as draenei female had a small hitbox of only 0,5. In a match between those to the deadzone basically was nonexistant and either of the two was firing while the other was forced to melee
---
but can you expound on that no for 22:57?
---
People really can't take a joke here...
---
saved, thanks!
---
Never said anything about 120pvp, what I know about 120pvp you could fit on a postage stamp.
---
But the earlier poster didn't say anything about 120pvp either. And I just googled "frost mage BFA PvP" and in videos they seem to be rooting people and running away and stuff. So I am thinking this is just more ignorant circlejerking about BFA from people with little or no first-hand experience.
---
Hyena quest in Vol'dun.
---
OSRS has a nice advantage that it's more of a sandbox game than a theme park. Theme parks like WoW live and die by content releases. There's probably enough meat in Classic to keep it fresh for up to two years, but after that it will start needing additions of some kind to keep it growing. Maybe by end of year one it will be large enough and make Blizzard scratch their chin.
---
You're the man now, dawg.
---
World buffs are great because it made blackrock pvp that much meaning. Literally horde vs alliance. Which guild will come out on top?! Pvp affecting the enemies' pve is a GREAT and FANTASTIC and UNDERUTILIZED mechanic in games. But people qq hars about true pvpve content which is why AV was stripped down and most of the pve elements removed.
---
you are on a sub-reddit dedicated to classic WoW the players here are gonna be far more dedicated to the game than the average player, a much larger portion of players here are gonna be min-maxers.
---
He s just being pedantic. Attributes had use, item rarity meant something, plenty talents to choose from, spell ranks and so on are all rpg features.

Lmao, nice reading comprehension.

Don't pick your class based on what you think the population will be. There was never a single class in Vanilla that saw overpopulation. Level your favorite, be good, and you'll always find groups for everything.
---
how?  balance in vailla is laughable and most fights were just tank and spank
---
Undead all the way!
---
It's easy to escape an hide on a NE hunter.  I had the same problems with my rogue. I loved wPvP with him, but hated everything else and rogues are not a great BG class so I wasn't going to do the honor gear grind.
---
__RP wise rogues aren't stealthy.__
---
From what I can tell, 'RPG features' are everything that has been removed from retail WoW that people like.
---
ifitsreditsdead.jpg
---
&gt;Use aspect of the pack too, Cos everyone can move faster, and who doesn’t like that?
---
wait, isn't that a good thing? (Does it mess with the number of buffs people can have at once time?)
---
Yeah, totally understand that.
---
OSRS keeps adding content tho, I wonder if people would like that for wow aswell. Add new raids and such, but with the same old mechanics/old school wow animations, etc.
---
Eventually they'll have to progress it somewhere, and im not sure if older expansions is the answer
---
I’m waiting for a ooga gang type thing on alliance with all female dwarf rogues
---
Track Hidden works equally for both and still isn't that great. Track Humanoids doesn't help with stealthed units at all.

Yes, you have to be level 35 to get any profession to 300.
---
round robin lmao
---
Seems like my buddy’s who don’t play WoW anymore are gonna make classic main game while my buddy’s that still play retail plan to have classic as a side game. Luckily retail and classic can both be played half ass and still get fulfillment out of them.
---
This is not the case in vanilla wow my dude.
---
I got hooked in vanilla when a trial CD came in my Maxim magazine.
---
Are you sure that CoT should be eaten by grounding totem, as far as it was in original vanilla (not private servers).
---
How is anyone supposed to know that you didn't place the totem AFTER receiving CoT?
---
Also how is anyone supposed to know what point you are trying to make if you don't explain anything in the caption...
---
I remember opening it so many times after the first. Just to read all the details about the game

This one? I don't see why it wouldn't work.

I was kinda disappointed that you didn't include whole Defias Brotherhood questline lore in your Deadmines lore compendium =/
---
Pretty much, yes. Though you'd be wasting your time *and* money if you did have an active sub.
---
&gt; Its just a condescending shitty thing to say. You're too dumb or naive know what you want, or you're to dumb to know whats actually good.
---
Anyone who has ever shipped any kind of product to a customer will probably back this statement up, though. It's generally not the customer's job to know what they want. 
---
And honestly, I am super stoked for vanilla and I'm enjoying the beta immensely, but... he kinda had a little bit of a point. There is a metric crapton of stuff that's different or QoL bits missing that I totally forgot about. I won't playing a druid this time around, for instance, because they're fucking annoying in vanilla. Turns out all my rosy memories were actually of TBC.
---
That's freaking cool.
---
I might be mistaken, but doesn't the manual also state that druids could use polearms, which they couldn't?
---
According to Blizzard, yes. I think the only exceptions are to know someone at Blizzard who could get you in, or be a popular streamer.

I know I’m going to roll a hunter and due to my friends playing alliance, I am going to play alliance. I am so torn on Shadowmeld vs Stoneform for PvP. Help me!!!

And probably his 10 other posts on the subject as well.
---
Famously huge turd.
---
In the short term, yes.
---
In the long term I doubt it.
---
There are no target dummies in Classic.
---
And I don't know what you're asking. The debuff slot limit means Warlocks will always be outclassed by classes that don't depend on debuff and even then I'm not sure they could match them.
---
Yeah i was a dumb kid i hate my old self lmfao

Yes. It takes too long to get them.

---
So something should be removed from the game simply because you're not willing to put the work in?
---
So just one screenshot of a lock at the top of the meters will make your post confirmed? (Whatever you were asking, still not quite sure)
---
The only flaw I see in EPGP is that it doesn't work well with legendary's, so yes a loot council makes sense for those specific items or a loot council to gear up your MT. However, I'm personally going to avoid any guilds that use loot council as their primary way to award gear. Everyone has biases and when those biases become obvious to some members, drama will occur and people will leave. As far as rewarding performance, I don't think that is a gear thing, I think that is a guild rule thing. You need to set goals and rules that you expect out of your members. I was an officer for a raiding guild for a while and we would have meetings about performance and attendance of certain players who didn't meet our standards and yes on occasion we did have to kick people who weren't meeting our expectations. But we were a hardcore raiding guild (16hrs a week minimum), so if your looking to be more casual, it will be a little more difficult and you will have to form more relaxed rules.
---
This is probably the truth. Classic being easier than 1.1-1.11 is irrelevant because 1.12 is the version we've asked for and the version we're getting. Classic being easier than private servers is definitely irrelevant since private servers are by definition wrong on most accounts.
---
&gt; Well that's just not true, but even aside from that the servers will have layering so congestion shouldn't be a huge issue.
---
3,000 players per layer = totally no congestion. Got it.
---
Shadow meld + cat prowl is super fun! 
---
Feign death into eat/drink + shadowmeld makes you and your pet disappear from battle. Also fun for playing defense!
---
Whaaat he got two accounts invited?!?!?  Seems a little unfair lol.
---
not gonna spend even a copper on new spells until 40 so I can buy my mount 😎

---
Numbers can always be rebalanced/adjusted with new tiers. Certain content was added in later patches as catch-up (no reason to do MC/BWL if you can do DM/ZG/AQ20), and same can be done again. You wouldn't need to rebalance all tiers, but i.e. you could introduce T4 which is ~5% stronger than current T3, while reducing power of T3 by ~5%.
---
Your post gave me an idea though. New tiers and content changed the most optimal builds through-out the game. i.e. Mages went from Frost to Fire. Shadow Priests post-ZG, etc. So new tiers don't necessarily need a straight power boost to Fury warriors, and instead could focus on different builds and scale accordingly? i.e. it could make Arms more viable for pve, Moonkins? etc. It could be fun to puzzle raids together with new optimizations for setups; just need pve mechanics to take advantage of it.
---
I doubt it, at least once you take away the Retail players just giving Classic a spin while they wait for new content. And even then it would need to have double the subscribers of Retail for Blizzard to start prioritizing it. Microtransactions are half their revenue and Classic doesn't have any.
---
Samesies
---
And I think if they are going to add content, adding more sandbox-style content would be much more valuable longterm than another raid. A raid will add, what, 6 months at most? And then what? Do they just keep adding raids? It seems like insanity for them to repeat the same mistakes.
---
You understood it
---
this ain't 2004 anymore bud, you can load more than a dozen addons without worrying about ram usage
---
Yeah dude, I bet Blizzard has *no idea at all* which game each account is playing.
---
I don't thinks raids are a good answer, but I'm completely open to new content. Raids will just delay the population dropoff, but it won't actually make the game much better.
---
the 1.12 AV is too quick to be fun, no elites, no giant buildups etc, just easy 30 minute games. Very reptitive ):
---
Don’t think so. By the time you get the cast off the mob pats out of range of pyroblast and it fails.
---
I never had a problem with it. To each his own
---
&gt;Warlocks are the strongest class in a 1v1 fair fight. No question.
---
They're not even the strongest 1v1 class, 3 minute UD mages and prep rogues both have a higher amount of matches they should beat consistently.
---
Well met
---
BlackRock mountain alone is bigger than some video games are in total.  It's just crazy,The main concourse, Brd, LBRS, UBRS, BWL (also BWA I guess to)  Just an awesome set piece.
---
&gt; to balance the number of race/class combinations between factions.
---
I've always hoped this wasn't true. The thought of them sacrificing character choice that much for something as BS and meaningless and faction balance is behind stupid. Hell, add 1 more class combo to horde. Shits balanced.
---
Repost

There was a PTR test of AV. It wasn't in the beta.

Vanilla is the only expansion where i remember specific pieces of blue gear i have equipped and how i got it. Corpsemaker in rfk, ravager in sm armory, blue dragonscale shoulders i crafted for myself as a leather worker. Cant name a single piece of gear my bfa character is wearing but i know what my ilvl is.
---
What? One of the games yesterday went for 9 hours. The shortest game I played was about 90 minutes and I joined after it already started.

Tooltips have always been an accurate source of knowledge and facts within the majestic World of Wacraft.
---
Oh man I remember opening this bad boy like it was yesterday.
---
I agree! The problem is most people can't see past the holy Trinity or which does the most dps. Vanilla isn't that type of game. Each class fills a niche, a roll, an idea, brings options to the table to consider, different sets of tools. I wish we'd talk more about that than numbers. Imo that's what makes vanilla amazing. I could care less about numbers.
---
imo you'll see a fair number of players wanting to quest and grind rep rather than rush. Turning in the quest often turns into playing defense, and even 5-10 players doing that means the rush tactic is much more difficult.
---
They are the best dps in the game.  Every raid has as many mages as possible
---
It would probably be more vertical progression somehow, likely a level cap increase (hopefully on a different server so classic WoW is also perserved). All vertical progression based MMOs do it, there are MMOs that do horizontal progression (like GW2 and ESO) but they bring their own host of giant issues. WoW is lovingly crafted with many inspirations from Everquest, which by 2004 had already raised its level cap a few times so the Devs kind of already knew how the first expansion would go down.
---
On the bright side it allows Blizzard to avoid making the same mistakes they did in other expansions, like flying in BC. Classic WoW strips them of so much baggage and brings back the crowd that enjoys this type of gameplay so they could do so many risky RPG choices that they would get reamed for doing on retail.
---
You think grounding totem should absorb an entire 5 player AoE fear and not be destroyed?  Wtf am I reading?
---
The big thing to do is don't take melee weapons that have on hit powers unless no one wants it the next thing is agility is better then attack power.
---
Agility increases AP, Crit, Dodge and Armor so over all agility is better then just AP.
---
Lets look at [Barbarous Blade](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18520/barbarous-blade) so this gives you Improves your chance to get a critical strike by 1% and +60 Attack Power.
---
So you would need a item with 30 agility to get the same AP boost and a item would need 53 agility to give you the 1% crit so that means this is a great hunter item.
---
But something like the [Hydrocane](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9452/hydrocane) is a great item a hunter can use for the random underwater quest or farming.
---
Sucks to be you
---
What
---
I'm not fighting the logic, I'm just pointing out that the beta isn't a great representation of how long games will take given all the conditions. Personally, I haven't played on any Private servers lately.
---
Hi i'm a guy on the ClassicWoW sub who doesn't have anything to contribute other than my own negative opinion about everything
---
You can have a weapon in each hand tho
---
#nochanges
---
Thats only because people diidnt know what they were doing, i was watching a streamer that did it in 15minutes, and when people actually understand how to do it, you can manage to get 7 minute Alterac Valleys.
---
__Track Hidden works equally for both and still isn't that great. Track Humanoids doesn't help with stealthed units at all.__
---
Which server?
---
Melee kill stuff faster in low dungeons.  But mages were the best dps for nearly every raid and end game dungeon
---
What is this?
---
Alliance also had it way easier getting attuned to onyxia.   way less quests in BRM
---
This is pretty awesome
---
Huh?
---
FYI to anyone with the vanilla collector's edition: The pets from it will work on Classic servers. But you can only pick one per character. There isn't any pet sharing, so the one you pick is it.
---
Vanilla Warlocks are considered strong only by weaker players. In real group PvP they're the weakest class, being highly vulnerable to dispels and focus fire (being the least survivable class as well as having no anti-pushback).
---
Play what you want man. At the end of the day it's up to you not anyone else.  
---
You could play a race you hate looking at just because of a racial and end up not enjoying it just based of animations alone. Or pick something you do like and your overall enjoyment will be more important then a racial. My 2cents in the end it won't matter much. Your racials won't be up for every pvp encounter anyways.

Grounding totem soaks one spell every 10 sec and with spell batching it's also common to cast the totem and get a spell on you at the same time.
---
I was hoping for this the entire time after the successful tame.
---
Blizzard doesn't have any data previous to 1.12 and they're not going to spend a dime developing new content for Classic let alone remake old content from scratch.
---
You were an enchanter and a leatherworker? I kinda want enchanting on my shaman but idk what to pair it with since tailoring seems the natural pair. But doesn’t do shaman much good.
---
Disgusting! I want to play game with war between Horde and alliance. Don't make game like retail. I can't wait for raw classic world pvp and ganking. I can help enemy only in one - help them die!
---
Ps
---
Yeah, I play undead rogue...
---
Even my wife liked original AV and she hates pvp.
---
It was in the beta. Tauren players complained about it a lot on the forums. It was only taken out for release.
---
Source: [1.1.0 Patch Notes](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.1.0)
---
Finish a warrior then level a mage. The amount of times you die or overpull and survive WILL surprise you.
---
It's just the standard wow vanilla numbers.
---
14 AP = 1dps
---
1 str = 2 AP (except for rogues and hunters)
---
20 agi = 1 crit (except for rogues)
---
From what I understand both are viable but dwarf is a bit more viable for pvp.
---
You want a hard game, so private servers with adjusted difficulties may be the game you prefer to play.
---
Unfortunately for you, WoW was designed for casuals and always has been.
---
Very nice and thank you!
---
Unironically yeah. You're basically never getting stunned in pve anyway so it's just a neat bonus against rogues every once in a while.
---
What you said there - " Warlocks will always be outclassed by classes that don't depend on debuff " like I don't get why that matters
---
I guess I just care about PvP, to me warlocks seem like an underpowered version of mages, unless their raw damage is higher. I don't know much about them, I've only gotten a mage to level \~40
---
Seems to me only the streamers are complaining to me 30min av sounds fucking lush compared to 1-24hour mindless mess's
---
Wing blade and Outlaw sabre plus marks spec.  I know most level beast but I've always been a fan of the burst  damage of emptying your mana pool on something.
---
who are you, and what are you doing in Classic wow threads, go back to retail...
---
Thats like saying i almost came first nah bitch they dodnt win so they couldnt have won
---
No, it never did that. That was a miss implementation on private servers. Blink always did teleported you forward.
---
lol.  they made major glyphs cosmetic too?
---
Who are you and why do you think people care for your pointless opions go back to retail
---
I'm just wondering how they perform in PvP, and the current raid consensus people have of "oh this class is stronger, weaker, etc" doesn't seem to take into account that people choose to have certain classes do more damage. Like even when they compare server-wide mage DPS meters, they don't take into account some fact about a fire debuff that gets attributed to one mage
---
So I just want to see a warlock hitting a mob all out for 1 minute, and then maybe a mage and the rest of the classes. I kind of found some videos online but they aren't what I'm looking for
---
because they arent pointless and are the large majority, lol
---
That doesn't mean he's wrong though
---
Mage DPS depends on 1 debuff for Frost and 2 debuffs for Fire. Warlock DPS depends on a lot of damage-over-time abilities which will get knocked off the boss or knock off more important debuffs and thus are not allowed.
---
In PVP, Warlocks and Mages are completely different. There's no use comparing them.
---
It makes it so anyone who gets meleed gets a 3 second daze
---
I name my characters after my favorite foods. 
---
It's kinda my own type of "family" name. I get entertaining comments on the names, guildies know whose alt it is, and I don't stare at a screen with a blank stare for 5 minutes before doing 20 minutes of Google searching to find a name I like that isn't taken. Win win naming strategy. 10/10 would use again.
---
Have you got proof that the majority of wows community want this? Link please if not its just a pointless opinion
---
Not 3000 players in one spot though.  Besides, it wouldnt affect routing.
---
That velcro was legit
---
The large majority doesn't want it because, the large majority of the people who have ever played vanilla don't even know classic wow is releasing, and have never played pre 1.12 AV. At this point, people want blizzard to listen to people who only started playing private servers 3 years ago. Lmao
---
How would one form the idea when they say "you know it would be cool if we had a raid here." People always ask for an emerald dream raid that was an idea. They're not really making a raid they're saying we want this raid and you make it blizzard
---
Oh no! Show us on the voodoo doll where the bad hunter touched you.
---
Minority wants it - won't happen.
---
I think it is primarily the leveling experience that separates vanilla from the expansions. There is a lot more character development while leveling in vanilla in comparison to the expansions (talent trees, buy spells/abilities of different ranks, weapon skills, meaningful gear upgrades). Character development is necessary in a good rpg. I want to be in a good raiding guild that matches my skill level, but at the same time I want to experience the leveling process again. It seems some guilds want to rush the leveling process and start raiding as quickly as possible. I get people want bragging rights to be some of the first guilds to clear MC, but I feel like these people will be missing out on one of the main reasons why Vanilla was so good.
---
Nost never was shit lol
---
I'm comparing them to get an idea of which playstyle I'd like more,
---
Diving into a group of players as a mage and trolling them with slows and aoe and ice blocking looks hella fun, but so does moving around like a 10 foot swinging dick dude destroying people one at a time
---
Are you okay?
---
pm server
---
Not a chance
---
Raw damage output is a piss poor way to compare Warlock and Mage in PVP.
---
I think it’d be a good idea. Might fill in a lot of people that played back in the day and aren’t active on reddit or twitch. Also, the game is cool enough to reach a whole new audience I think. It did it once
---
kek
---
The time leveling felt rewarding, god I wish retail still would have it...
---
300ms for me felt like 500+ ms elitestjerks that never actually played vanilla but *know everything* thats my experiances from nost but im not bashing it as its the 1 exception
---
This is just a weird thread - you don't want to accept the dps tiers but want to argue that warlock is "silently stronger" than other classes.
---
For pvp if warlocks couldn't fear they would lose to mage/rogue/warrior 100% of the time.
---
It's not about them having raw damage - it's the kit. Use your utility and you can win, don't and gg... especially against players that know what they are doing.
---
What does mount having to do with blink?
---
&gt;The penalty for using a Spirit Healer has been changed * there is no longer any experience loss, instead all items (equipped and inventory) will take 100% durability loss and the character will gain resurrection sickness for a duration that scale according to level.
---
Could you imagine this still being in?

I don't recall this being part of vanilla wow. https://www.twitch.tv/zetoxxd/clip/CorrectDignifiedEyeballPeteZarollTie https://www.twitch.tv/zetoxxd/clip/SlickDarkHabaneroTriHard

Commenting because I've been looking for the same thing. I assume we are getting the modern macro system.
---
Millions of people have an active sub.
---
There are less than 10k in the beta.
---
Math.
---
Actually is a Moo point. It’s because a Tauren’s opinion doesn’t matter
---
Patch 1.1.0 removed that along with tauren plains running. 
---
"RP wise" treasure hunter doesn't fit dwarves at all.
---
Stone Form + Remove Curse is my dream
---
Ya i think your wrong if you look here on Petopia classic page here [Pet Attack Speeds](https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/attackspeed.php) they talk about how atk speed doesn't affect pet dps.
---
That’s just finance capitalism
---
What u mean bro
---
DPS matters so that healers don't run out of mana before a fight ends. Beyond that it's coordination, individual class DPS shouldn't matter if it's a group working together, you bring more of one class and less of another. But judging choosing a class from how well they do in 3 hour single hotkey spamming doesn't make sense
---
Now THAT would be hard.
---
"Instant respawn"
---
kk
---
If locks did the most damage by far, they'd be incredibly OP with their pets and CC. You seem to be forgetting locks fear, pet CC and silence, etc. 
---
When a mage is caught, they are deleted it they don't have blink/iceblock. If a lock is caught, and can't fear, they still have a chance tbh. That's a pretty big difference.
---
Also there are numerous videos of raw DPS for classic classes, I remember a YouTuber that did a patchwork series for I believe every spec possible.
---
Interesting. I don't remember that in the beta at all, I only remember it being referred to on the forums and in patch notes. I did play horde in the beta as well. I suppose perhaps I ignored Tauren altogether.
---
Filth.
---
No mailbox Just like classic was! perfect
---
This. I find it incredibly suspicious that they're testing AV with lvl 58 character.
---
Zug zug.
---
No... You're wrong my dude. Attacks aren't normalized like they are in latest versions of WoW. Yes, attack speed doesn't affect DPS; DPS is attack speed times damage, both required to affect DPS.
---
Dude. stop bashing on other peoples experiences.
---
Evocation is pretty much essential for both PvE and PvP, dunno how anyone could ever consider it not worth buying.
---
It will.
---
I think they are objectively higher quality, and subjectively better looking.  
---
If you think of quality as in the resolution/detail, new models have more.
---
&gt;I think Blizzard will be shocked with the turnout for classic.
---
They know what type of numbers to expect, they won't be shocked.
---
It's not a game that is going to build up popularity like Apex did... blizzard is going to start off at the highest point at launch and rapidly decline. 
---
Of course people will come into the fold over the lifespan of classic, but the pinnacle of Classic interest is the first month (and will be the most fun part of classic)
---
&gt;What race do you recommend for this?
---
Dwarf of course, not only are all of their racials useless for a PvE Hunter, they don't even fit it at all lore-wise.
---
Make sure to snag a variation of "Gimli"
---
Stoneform helps you escape after a rogue opens on you, my Hunter will be a dwarf for that reason alone.
---
Hold on, logically you think that DPS tiers, where classes are restricted by debuff limits (a majority of lock abilities), are a one-to-one relationship with their true DPS?
---
Macros are for lazy people too. So are keybinds.
---
Great add on. Respeccing gets expensive early on.
---
I wish it had been a closed beta with no streaming allowed. I'm still hyped but I also haven't really watched any streaming whatsoever of the beta.
---
I'm the opposite. I just started playing on a private server because of classic wow coming back. Deciding if I want to warlock main again or main a different class. Also trying alliance leveling for the first time since beta for vanilla.
---
Wait, really? AQ40/Naxx were cleared on day 1?!
---
And you don’t get the portal spell until 50
---
That was beautiful
---
Have you ever actually played a Druid..? None of this is how it works.
---
That isnt very loktar ogar of you.
---
And it begins. 🤪
---
Username doesnt check out.
---
This is either a troll thread or you don't understand how this game works... Even if warlocks were given all the debuff slots they could want they wouldn't outperform rogues and mages.
---
Classic is great because of the great community it has... You fucking nitwit /s
---
I have a hard time remembering the first generation too.  When Skittles made HWL I got invited to guild to fill his slot.  And yes he was a BG lead.  He joined SSDD.  I remember Lai because he was like a hero to a lot of us, he would kill everything on the field then start charging Allies respawning on the graveyard to climb up the hill.  He quit a month or two after making r14. By the time I joined, only a priest and druid from the the old guard remained and they made HWL a week after as well.  The priest logged in to make HWL- never logged in again.  The druid quit about a week after making it.  I wish there was way to search people by guild history.
---
1% of the retail wow players are doing any of the arena and world first content you are talking about.
---
Look at me, I'm Ragnaros. Could I BE wearing any more fire? 🔥🔥🔥
---
Cool addon but it just seems pointless.
---
Ok do you have proof, that's what the thread's about
---
I don't understand what this does.
---
Private server populations have **surged**, many more people playing.
---
Solo dps can't kill raid bosses.
---
Still don't understand the point of this? To get someone to say warlocks do good dps? They do better dps than spriests and balance druids.
---
Mad!
---
As long as you know that going in - you'll actually enjoy classic.
---
None of us will. Thanks, global warming!
---
Good post :)
---
I mean there's the entirety of Vanilla and then 15 years of private servers that all say the same things, but you don't seem to believe any of that info. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Answer me a question: obviously you can’t AoE grind every pack of mobs. With classic there’s going to be a lot of competition for mobs so questing will likely be more efficient. But occasionally when you find an empty area with lots of melee mobs it would be nice to do some aoe grinding for a while. But obviously Frostbite is a really nice talent to have for Frost single target leveling builds. Is it worth it to drop that talent for aoe grinding, even if it’s only occasional?
---
The point is to make it easier to plan out your leveling spec and what order without memorising it or having a browser open. There you go, now it's not pointless.
---
Crouton on The venture co (US-RP-PVP). Somehow managed to get server first full t2 and legendary as a stupid 16 year old. If anyone from venture co is still around i miss you all, see you in 2 months :)!
---
I agree. My wifes son is very displeased with this current AV implementation.
---
This, i stopped playing BDO at the announcement of classic
---
Each family of pets have their own stats but the dps rate of pets in the 
---
 same family are the same no matter their individual atk speed.
---
Just backpedal. I watched Tribe hamstring a mob and backpedal and the mob couldn't damage him. He also duelled perplexity (I think it was him) and perplexity back-pedalled and tribe couldn't hit him unless he was literally standing on top of him lol. Backpedal = new meta. Which means more people should want to play hunter...
---
I'm kinda done with the Beta. I don't want to play too much to spoil myself for Release.
---
Que?
---
ITS NOT LEEWAY
---
LEEWAY IS DIFFERENT AND THIS IS JUST MELEE EXTENDED ATTACK RANGES BASED ON MOVEMENT
---
Oh, that's what you mean. You're right about pet families having the same DPS.
---
Nah yall are all missing the point. Let's say you have 30 raiders, ready to go. A Ret guildie wants to come. This sub implies their response will be "sorry no, rogues are better DPS". And this you to raid with 30, not 31, people.
---
The point is you're not going to have 40 "perfectly specced" raiders ready to go for every single raid. 30 good specs and 10 meme specs are still better than just 30 good specs.
---
Wasn’t there a Sherlock episode about him?
---
Minority? Can you back that up?
---
I truly do miss the joy that comes with saving enough money or grinding enough to get that spell that you wanted.
---
Making spells free completely killed any sort of progression in the game.
---
can you explain 4:3 or w/e u r talking about?
---
Thats due to drought of content atm dont be fooled every xpac wow has had it always tops ttv
---
Yeah, I remember using blink extensively while traveling. Blinking from the AH to the Bank was basically muscle memory.
---
Im not bashing their experiances just the servers the enjoy stop taking things out of context like a foolish child
---
But you have 4-10 days played time to plan your levelling spec... you're saving like 1 minute of thinking time... which you can do while grinding mobs. Still pointless to me.
---
Oh my god I always thought it was an abstract wisp of smoke.
---
People like AV so much it is dead on every server a month after it comes out.
---
What would have been beautiful would be if you you got him to follow you around a corner to a pack of allies that killed him.
---
Sargeras has been emitting co2 throughout azeroth for millenia, it is known.
---
I'm completely new to WoW, currently a level 12 Orc Hunter (on vanilla).
---
I have read in guides that for beginners while leveling a cat is the best hunter pet.
---
However, someone I met in org who was level cap and seemed very knowledgable told me a boar was the best pet at the beginning. 
---
I'm currently in the barrens (at lvl 12) and I see savannah cats at level 11-12 that I could tame. Should I be keeping my boar pet or switch to cats?
---
&gt; Hard to nerf a class that they gave Fear, Seduce, and Death Coil to, particularly when you only ever target the first one and they're on separate DR. 
---
Same DR on Seduce / Fear since mid 2005.
---
&gt; this is the internet
---
Fuck I hate this reply. Theres nothing special about "the internet", it's all humans. Humans tend to share bad stuff more than good stuff.
---
Well it seems like raids have warlocks use curse of elements, and don't use corruption, and don't use curse of agony (or the shadow damage/resist debuff)
---
I see plenty of hunters kiting melee classes just fine on the beta. I don't think those dudes feel like their class is broken.
---
yup, private servers run 1.12 AV, i just want original, i dont think it will die near as quickly, and whats the risk in trying, if current AV dies in 1 month
---
When I see epic vanilla/BC gear I get a little thrill. With retail loot I couldn't care less, everything is so flashy and shiny that nothing is.
---
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE BOOOOI
---
Unfortunately, Venture Co. has gone to shit. It's like 2:1 Horde to Alliance.
---
Sure thing- blizzard is implementing layering at launch due to a high population of people that "just want to check what the fuss is about"
---
Because of that - it makes the population of Classic much larger than this sub reddit (most of which don't agree with each other and just like to repost screenshots of them not being able to press play"
---
Even if 100k people on this sub voted for "their" AV - it would still be the minority of what the population of Classic will be.
---
Blizzard will do what they want with their game, to make it the most accessible - within their "Vanilla limits"
---
I don’t believe you could bid on your own auction, you’re correct.
---
Welcome to last month my dude.
---
Cast your mind back to classic official forums. The worst is yet to come.
---
Why people live at all? At some point, we all die.
---
ignorant people circlejerking about bfa on this sub? *shock*
---
No, he's talking about Glyph of momentum and the subsequent legion option and probably thinks it was like that in vanilla.
---
You still don't get raid DPS =/= pvp DPS
---
annnd downvoted
---
Again it comes down to the raid - if it's the top 1% pushing guilds, they have a reason - if you are within one of these guilds - they could answer the questions way better than this sub.
---
Otherwise, most groups will go through with multiple of each class rather than stacking "the best" classes.
---
Not fair to put the entire classic raiding population into the same group as those that will optimize their full 40 man raid.
---
Sorry to bear bad news.  But I think you misunderstood the insult!
---
https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tryhard
---
Also, guilds gotta be friendly places or it's time to move on.  :)
---
There are no major/minor glyphs anymore. There's like 5-10 glyphs per class. Pet classes usually have more on average because they have glyphs to change demon/elemental appearances + spell effects. Like my mage right now has a total of 9 glyphs. 4 change the appearance of the water elemental (frost only now), 1 adds sparkles to slow fall, 1 lets you cast Poly on critters and it lasts a day, 1 makes your polymorphs bigger, 1 makes you catch fire after using Combustion, and the last changes your Arcane Brilliance buff to be the Kirin Tor symbol instead of the base one. Such a great use of a profession, right?
---
Oh the feelings. That nostalgia.
---
I love you
---
Of course you'll see Horde complaining about decent human civility in this post lmao
---
The PvP server is fun. Chicken coop HH.
---
Play a druid and figure out which class you want to play that way. I am learning I want to play a druid (or shammy)
---
It also sucks ballz.
---
Why is Magneto part of the Avengers?
---
I agree
---
How do you figure? It's a dwarven stereotype that goes beyond wow.

Female pink haired gnome is worse. Too bad I wont roll Alliance.
---
\#RP WISE ROGUES AREN'T STEALTHY.
---
Boars can be neat for beginners because they eat any type of food and have a charge that can help establish more threat.
---
The downside is that Boars do a lot less damage than cats. They're good training wheels but subpar if you want to optimize your kill speed. Cat is the best pet in the game overall, but other pets can be better for specific niches or playstyles.
---
It was like double the mana cost for like 37 extra damage! Dunno what Blizz was thinking with those numbers.
---
Pet totem killing macros better not be a thing, or ima be pissed.  Fuck that shit...
---
Nothing. #flatazeroth
---
And flavor, I think. Dwarves are often portrayed as being "from the earth" and more magically resistant than magically adept. 
---
I just wish we could have played any race/class combination, even if some come with a stiff penalty like Taurens rogues being visible despite stealth.
---
At work, limited time to search. Thanks for the help
---
I do remember opening it. And then I remember reading the manual and planning my character while it took forever to install. 
---
I got it after high school the day it came out and I remember my girlfriend kept calling and trying to talk to me once it was finally installed. 
---
Sorry babe, I have murlocs to slay.
---
Thanks
---
Um. That's not how hitboxes work.
---
Same here. Played av all day, couldn't pull off one fd trap combo, regardless of the pet being active or even alive.
---
I mean, I raid specifically to play optimally. But it would kind of be disappointing and boring if everyone had this mentality.
---
I can't wait to see hunters and rogues in cloth spirit gear. Now THAT is what classic was all about to me. It was sooo much easier to be an elitist jerk back then lol
---
Never had class on Friday, and my girlfriend and I were both in college about 45 minutes away from each other. So many Thursday nights I'd try to convince her I needed to stay at my place instead of going to visit her.
---
Care to explain why?
---
Probably. I'd like it but then you'd have alliance with an extra tank.
---
Would it be possible to save different templates rather than having to re-import them every time?
---
What does wtg mean again?
---
Frakin cool dude, thanks
---
Isn't that just the time of day.
---
It did block AoE spells... on patch 1.4. Since this is 1.12 this is not a bug,
---
Hero class btw
---
YES YES YES THIS
---
MAGE IS SO GOOD AT 20
---
Hmmm ya. It's a slippery slope I suppose
---
Some people have plenty of spare time in the summer so were planning to use that. Fall season is when school starts and alot of businesses start getting busier for the holidays. Know some who would play regardless of summer prog but not going to play much at all in the fall.
---
Is the top left one’s name Kyle?
---
Wow i cant beleive you went all over reddit downvoting me and even replying that you downvoted me most likely over a single post truley impressive pettiness
---
I started playing on private servers because of the Blizzcon Classic Demo.  I was like, oh I can't quit after this taste.
---
There are no "trash" debuffs in vanilla (like Shadow Embrace in TBC) or other dispel protection, so yes dispelling every warlock magic effect is a trivial matter for priests, and not a big deal for paladins. Cleanse in particular had an almost nonexistent mana cost.
---
My troll priest consistently nullified every alliance warlock in BGs regardless of skill level, just by mashing dispel.
---
Yeah i quit playing p servers once the announcment came out. No point in playing qhen i know 100% im not gonna be on these characters.
---
Gave myself a long ass break and have made some youtube videos just been researching and making hella lists for classic. No games really nothing holds my attention like classic
---
BFA trinket tooltips be like:  "Sometimes it does a thing that gives you a chance for a thing to happen"
---
If you have at +r10 geared hunter compared to a Naxx geared hunter of equal skill, how would they compare. Let's say what you like to do is pvp at which point can you skip raiding? Because why do Naxx if hunters are bad in there and you just want to pvp, unless the gear is needed.
---
The madman actually went to retail when told to.
---
I opted to play private server to “practice” it’s not been buggy at all. Other than the economy bring much different than fresh Classic I find it totally acceptable. One thing I do notice is resources are much more prevalent than they will be in classic.
---
BuH i HaVe FrEe FoOd AnD dRiNkS
---
He left a one sentence question and you wrote a wall of text chucking out for a woman who will never acknowledge your existence. Top fucking kek
---
Look at platforms that hold classic content.
---
People here downvote everything, that makes sense. They are mostly blizzard sucking sheeps. I dont even mean to offend anyone, its just how it goes here
---
&gt; It would probably be more vertical progression somehow, likely a level cap increase 
---
But why? Sorry, but that really sounds like a terrible idea. If they are adding content, they should definitely keep it locked at 60. If not, they might as well just release TBC instead.
---
&gt; On the bright side it allows Blizzard to avoid making the same mistakes they did in other expansions
---
Their biggest mistake was increasing the level cap and nullifying all the content of the previous version. This is why modern wow, despite being a culmination of Vanilla and 7 expansions, feels so lifeless and void of content.
---
The explanation is pretty obvious... weird lighting, missing textures / features, bugs. This is beta. As in "Not the final product". This game is not yet released, so you asking for an explanation is kinda ridiculous. It's been reported, and I'm sure blizzard is aware of the lighting issues. This is the point of a "beta". To report issues and have them corrected. What kind of explanation are you looking for?
---
My shaman on that server was my alt and my gameplay dropped off dramatically after I hit rank 12. I casually played him after ranking. I went back to my first 60 a gnome warrior who I had done the same grind to rank 12 on. I didnt play the shaman after vanilla till around wod when I server transferred to the same server as my warrior and other alts. 
---
Sounds like we just missed each other. Cause I was ahead of Skittlez in rank and quit grinding at 12. I think the priests name was alfred. Pretty much everyone went to SSDD after they finished the pvp grind at least those that continued to play. Good times though, so many weekends spent rolling alliance in wsg and ab. Waking up early on Saturday and playing games until the q's stopped popping. Then doing it all over again on Sunday. I really hope that classic is able to foster a pvp community similar to what we had back in vanilla. I want server rivalries and knowing all the hardcore pvpers on both factions. I recall on more than one occasion alliance having horde alts that messaged me and complimented me on my pvp abilities. The pvp community was easily my favorite part of vanilla wow. I really want it to be apart of classic so badly. I'm just worried about crossrealm bg's having a negative impact on it. Sorry for the long winded post.
---
I didn't start playing til 2007, but I still very much want classic to start on a version and patch the game progressively just like they did in vanilla. Would be some weird broken buggy fun.
---
Yes...
---
Personally, I’d like get in to the beta to play test mage, warlock, and shaman again.  I’ve mostly forgotten how they felt and i really only want to invest in one character since I have less time now.  It would be good to know before getting in and wasting a bunch of time and trying to play catch up with my friends.
---
As someone who played classic when they were very young and thus, has little experience with talent trees, this will be invaluable, very cool and thanks for making :)
---
I don't see any valid points. If these are your best points you can come up with it is not exactly a surprise you are wrong so often.
---
Yeah no
---
Careful, people freak out here if you work with players on the opposite faction. I for one like that it's all player choice to help each other.
---
It litterally took 1/5 of the time it took to make the post.
---
Immersion.
---
Amazing work on this and ClassTrainerPlus Fusion, I’ll totally be using both when Classic launches.
---
Picking something you like playing as is more important than picking the best racial.
---
That said, if you don't have any preference, play a dwarf. Stoneform is better than the extra stealth levels. Humans are a solid choice too - sword skill is awesome for PvE and Perception lets you always have the opener on other rogues in PvP.
---
I agree. The current gearing system was the final straw for me it just takes the fun away.
---
Getting the original av will not solve your problem ppl will zerg anyway there are no reason for ppl to play long av the majority of players play for rewards. What you need to change is the way ppl play the game.
---
Noggenfogger/savoury...
---
It's not that they're suboptimal, it's that oomkin is complete shit in drawn out bossfights, and ret steals gear from actual good dps classes.
---
I dont understand it myself. I quit i the day mist was announced... im content with waiting till release. Not watching any videos and what not. Just waiting.
---
Majority? can you back this up?
---
Top 5 of what?
---
So you’re rebuttal to people not playing the game is that it always has a lot of viewers on twitch with new content?
---
Could be because OP is horde? Typical alliance being so judgemental!
---
Thats too bad, i left around wotlk. I thought it was a great sized server for world pvp back in the day
---
So how did you get your Eye?  Always love hearing how the odd classes got it over warriors. Ours went to a ret as well. He didnt get any drops for like 3 weeks out of bad rng. And he was loaded on dkp.
---
I'd love to find out what server WoWHobbs will be rolling on. I'll take some free SM runs.
---
Test
---
It would because some quests aren't worth the wait because of spawn competition when they normally would be if there were no competition. Such as on the stress test it was quite impossible to kill kobolds in northshire so it would be better to grind other mobs which would not be the case with no competition.
---
No what's worse is rather then just not play the shitty product people will pay extra for it.
---
24 hour AV s are no fun and pointless.  Blindly running into 30 people and dying instantly, reading and repeat is not PvP. 
---
The AV they implemented looks perfect.  All the people complaining that av will just be mindless zerg, av was always at every level a mindless zerg. Half the group is actually PvP while 10 people are farming herbs and the other 10 are grinding rams to lvl from 51-60.
---
no, you’re literally the only one
---
I’ll never understand posts like this. In the title you recognize the fact that a simple google search will answer your question but you still decide to post this instead. Why?
---
So your opinion on the game is that its complete garbage no matter what and that no1 actually likes it? Im confused it seems like your just trying to argue any kind of point due to anger, i cant see why your even bothering to reply to me
---
Evidently lmao
---
Left out, so far.
---
Exactly
---
I think the spell crit trinket is harder to replace, and crit do vital to ele to see those ungodly numbers. (Crit also important for enhance, but mostly you just want WF procs, and that 20% never changes). You'll always have HoJ on anyway as Enhance.
---
I had friends at blizzard invite me, and only 1 of my friends got in with me. Even though they were submitted by employees. 
---
So, pretty much certain the beta invites are donezo.
---
These kinds of threads (PvE vs PvP, H vs A, etc) are full of throwaway accounts for the purpose of shitposting.
---
It's pretty sad.
---
I found mine a couple days ago.  It has 2 different copies of the game inside of it.  I must have stuffed both copies of the game that I bought into the same box.
---
Is this an inside joke I'm not privy to?
---
Not all movies are made to win awards. The awards don't really mean anything. All games are made for people to play them and when people are not playing your game then it is a bad game...
---
Yes, almost everybody on this sub.
---
Rip pet ever holding aggro if you go Marksman.
---
However if you go 1-60 as Marksman, you're a badass.
---
If you go 1-60 Surivival, you're a fucking god.
---
Just to add to your comment - druids can hit armor cap in blues with inspiration from priests and armor pots. Combined with a vast health pool, crush/crit is far less threatening with 75% physical damage reduction. An AQ/Naxx geared bear Druid is armor capped with around 14-15k HP buffed. 
---
Druids produce insane TPS, starting in pre-raid BiS - and with crowd pummeler usage can virtually eliminate the threat ceiling, allowing your raids dps to go HAM. This synergizes particularly well with high dps classes like warriors and late-tier warlocks with no hard threat dump.
---
Spells? Blink is amazing. A tele one a cd. Most games take that every time
---
&gt; Pyroblast is pretty bad though.

---
Decide for yourself. Assuming you'll be using your PVP trinket, decide what you'll be able to attain that would be better than either depending on spec.
---
Sham/Warr or Sham/Rogue would also be dope. You didn't mention Sham tho, so thinking you kids don't like it. Ele sham with warrior tho... you'll delete ppl.
---
I miss my keychain :(
---
Some guy died 87 times
---
Fuuuuuck that. #nochanges means #nochanges.
---
If you like LFR and teleporting to dungeons and Simon says mechanics and cross server grouping and buyable level boosts please feel free to keep playing retail :). You might like those things but lots of us don't which is why we're here.
---
Seeing that reminds me, what's the (\*) for? I used to see that back in the day.
---
Oh wow thanks for answering my question, I really appreciate your input thanks so much! What an amazing member of this community.
---
I'm just trying to figure out when 'hard mobs' and 'travel time' became RPG mechanics, but okay.
---
&gt; Scorpid sting
---
Played hunter since Nov 2005 and i never thought to do this
---
well yeah, not adding them would mean a change
---
Living action pot is first thing that comes to mind.
---
You can watch literally any other part of that video when vurtne is fighting a melee class - link me a time when he gets auto attacked from a range nearly as far as what we're seeing on beta now (even accounting for his huge latency)
---
Oh and since you want to rule out latency, explain this: https://youtu.be/Mh_cLN66zHA?t=259 :)
---
From the time i linked, they're both moving and on beta now vurtne 1000% would've been hit by an auto attack from the rogue.
---
Awesome mod thank you!
---
Modern WoW feels more like a dungeon crawler with some Dungeons and Dragons elements. It's lost so many RPG elements, that I'm not even sure it should be called an "MMORPG" anymore - just an "MMO".
---
Definitely not Druid. You don’t do much killing as a Druid, just a lot of running away. Can’t think of a worse class for ganking lol.
---
We're playing 1.12. The mounts were removed in 1.4.
---
Yea sorry I had mentioned that this is without potions.
---
Lol Human Paladin.
---
Damm just remembered how nice that was..
---
If looks could kill.
---
"WOW LITERALLY A PIECE OF OGRE SHIT LMAO COME LOOK AT THIS" lol'd
---
Im curious how you’ll feel about the hunter rotation if you feel the rogue ceiling isn’t high. Vanilla rotations were pretty basic all around
---
Level 10 Hunter and level 1 lock got you beat
---
 Yes, if you were in the stress test your account somehow was flagged to download, however, if you are not a beta tester you still will not have access. 
---
This AV test is just that a test, not a stress test, simply another beta test.
---
^^^RP ^^^wise ^^^rogues ^^^aren't ^^^stealthy.
---
with that argument you could also say that we should have naxx opened and skipped the aq opening event because we are in 1.12, already in phase one at launch
---
the petition wants the unarmored mounts for a small while, in phase one.
---
battlegrounds won't be with us in phase one at launch, so why should the new mounts be?
---
My body is ready.
---
I agree here for the most part. I am sure there are some people who really do enjoy the hours long AV games. The majority doesn't. It became a race when the spectacle of the big group vs group fights wore off. Hell, it's played as a PVE race on Pservers too, unless a turtle gets forced. 
---
I thought I was in the "longer AV" camp until this weekend. Playing these last two days, I'm definitely not. I wish there was a better alternative than pve race, but hours long AV games are actually incredibly boring affairs where 90% of the time nothing exciting is happening, just two lines trading blows endlessly.
---
So why would you not want them in game?
---
If you are a roleplayer you never use stealth and instead fight everything head on.
---
Git gud?
---
But you are rewarded for defending with HKs for ranks, right? so doesn't that make it worth it?
---
It's really not that simple and can't be described in a simple comment. There are so many decisions from both sides that could sway the outcome of the fight. You just have to be better.
---
Racial the cheapshot and the kidney.
---
It is known.
---
I would be very surprised if it didnt
---
Not much point posting this here. Just like in true vanilla those that weren't stressed about the perfect talent selection never came near the forums
---
Time gating content isn't the same and all of that content will be in its 1.12 form when it's released. There isn't a single thing in the game that will be in its 1.4 form.
---
They share subscriptions so no, but i think classic will pass BFA in players for a little while.
---
Yep.
---
I want something similar to this, but with classicbis site but you save templates of bis/near bis/ resist gear etc
---
Haven't touched a private server in months. 
---
Zero Interest.
---
I don't even care to play beta. I just want release and the real thing.
---
Is that your last resort?
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/DelightfulFurtiveStapleDBstyle
---
Imagine taking 10 seconds to use the search bar on reddit.
---
Good for you bud
---
Yes, almost all my guild from Nost PvE stopped playing in a 2-3 months after Nost being closed.
---
&gt; a lot of private servers are planning to shut down
---
As far as I know only one server will close. Others are going to continue operating.
---
As for me, I play FFXIV and also have some games on Steam I have bought but never played. I guess it will help me to last till August, 27st :)
---
Nobody gives a fuck. Stop wasting our time please.
---
Because even though I plan on zerging to 60 for a week one Rag kill and would likely be able to purchase them before Phase 2, I don't want it to become a thing. The whole "oh yeah, do you have THIS item from way back when?" is a showoff thing from Retail that Classic doesn't need or want.
---
This and it just became a mount collecting fest...
---
Well I’m guess I’m just asking if it’s even possible assuming I don’t racial any of the stuns, since he can just chain the two with a blind sap.
---
King's Honor
---
just take 30 seconds to search or just look at the actual subreddit and you’ll get your answer.
---
Not at all. You can do everything your class can do without talents in lower level dungeons.
---
Argument to be made for Capped Blizz servers after Classic release.
---
You could try and hybrid. 31 in holy and rest in ret. there’s a few videos of it doing ok in pvp dps and you’re able to heal so you can get into pve stuff. Not too positive on how it does pve wise for dps
---
People forget that after the initial content of OSRS ran out, the player counts plummeted hard until they started making all-new content for OSRS. That's when it started to rise high above RS3 in player counts.
---
But you could do all of that on a 1.12 vanilla private server...
---
Of course it's possible. If anything, you being an orc gives you the advantage when losing the opener.
---
what?
---
the fact that battlegrounds won't be at launch means that the honor system will be in it's 1.4 form.
---
mounts should be as well, you could say that the new mounts could be time gated.
---
The argument is that it will compel people who would otherwise not rush to 60 to rush to the level cap to get these time-limited mounts. Its at least Blizzards reasoning for not including them.
---
ah lol you're going to play undead I see...
---
releasing unarmored mounts at launch and removing them with DM would be the exact same form of time dating that they’re doing with raids.
---
you're the one that decided to click on the post on comment on it? :thinking:
---
Nost had many flaws, like paladin spelldamage scaling from AP, like it was in WotLK.
---
Well said.
---
This is false. The honor system will be in its 1.12 form. It had many changes since 1.4, including a major nerf to how difficult it was to rank up, and they'll all be in when the honor system launches.
---
They should buy better servers rather than add game enforced lag.
---
No.
---
RPGs for me means curating a character that’s seen some shit. They’ve traveled with us through some scary shit that, while we have survived, we’d likely never want to experience again. Of course while  I’m excited for vanilla and experiencing those events again, I highly do not recommend it. Some of the angriest moments I’ve ever experienced have been because of this game. It’s how we learn about karma. Revenge. Spite. I love an RPG only as much as I love my character. I love wow.
---
Naw
---
If people want to tryhard then that's fine, more power to them. I probably won't have the time to farm all the mats or gold I'd need for every single consumable that hardcore guilds require, and I'm okay with that. I prefer to be the relaxed dude who knows how to play his class to a T.
---
 It's when the community perception is skewed so hard that pug groups start reserving items left and right while demanding people be in BiS gear for shit that doesn't need it, like high level dungeons. To me that's some hardcore, retail brain, "you need to have 80 ilvl over the current content to do current content", carry me shit that Classic should not encourage or tolerate. The counter to this is to obviously start your own groups etc. but the behavior is still super shitty and should be put in check. 
---
Another thing, people need to stop thinking about classes in terms of their specializations. The most important thing to learn is to play the *whole* class and realize that specs are literally specializing in one aspect of the class. For example, you can still heal, buff, and cleanse as a ret paladin and you should absolutely know how to do that. Will you have heals as powerful as a deep holy specialized paladin? No, but you can still do it and you *need* to know how to do it even if you're just pvping.
---
I think rolling a warlock is a better option for healing, you have healthstones, you can boost your heal meter by healing yourself and your pet. You have a pre-emptive resurrect too.
---
If you get bored because there's nobody to heal you can start killing yourself with lifetap and hellfire.
---
Cuz you retards needa stop with this autism
---
I mean, it's assumed there less than 2 million subs right now playing BFA. I wouldn't be surprised if classic settled at more than that
---
Nobody needs it but most want it.
---
well alright, but that doesn't change the fact that bg's are absent, mauradon is absent, dire maul absent etc all time gated to match 1.4
---
i don't see why mounts should get the same treatment.
---
Wrong.
---
Adding 1.12 content in phases is not the same as adding 1.3 content for one phase and then removing it.
---
It has been confirmed and talked about millions of times.
---
Only active subs, popular streamers and some VIP can get beta.
---
The context I always saw try hard used wasn't an insult for someone who put in alot of effort it was for mediocre players who were trying hard but still sucked. Like if someone used engineering in a duel vs someone who wasnt engi and lost ? They were called a try hard as an insult. Have every consumable on the planet and lose in dps to someone w/o them or barely beat them ? Try hard.
---
As a winter chill mage you are better in solo, farm grind and pvp. I dont know why you shouldnt want to be the one.. is not a jebait, i am serious. Everybody will know that my dps as mage is lower because i use the "support" build... no one will blame you for doing lower dps. And you will be much better in all other aspects of the game!
---
you pwnd him
---
Thanks for your effort on this and helping spread the word.
---
Since Vanilla I've wanted to be a hunter but I've stuck to my druid and am fine with that.
---
This time over, I wanna be a hunter but with this in game 'fauck dat' my only other option is to play a male dwarf priest...
---
Would there be a way for an add-on like this to show the optimal order of unlocks?
---
For example, if I want to run 31/0/20 Shaman, maybe my placing isn't optimal compared to when you get certain skills in-game etc.
---
In other words, I have no idea which talents give the most bang for the buck early on, would there be a way for this add-on to help instead of "just" showing the order I ore selected?
---
thats just another perspective
---
you could say they're just not adding the new mounts 
---
and adding them later on, the mounts are in the game files anyways.
---
unarmored mounts match vanilla launch
---
You never lost xp in wow. Never.
---
Because the absence of 1.12 content is NOT the same as adding in 1.3 content and then removing it.
---
Also, Maraudon will be in at launch. And none of it will be gated to match 1.4. All the items, all the spells, all the talents, all the NPCs, they're all in their 1.12 form.
---
There is no 1.12 form of your precious mounts.
---
Nobody wants to play an av that lasts for days that's just stupid
---
Only this time, we have much more XP
---
im using my XP to build an educational learning plan so I can teach the joy of zen adventure gaming to the important people i now have, when I didn't have them it was the depressing era! now they get to learn. It's not an elective course.
---
I love lock... and s-priest. 
---
The priest leveling process was actually easier than lock for whatever reason for me.
---
just say that new mounts are time gated if you really want to avoid the word 'adding'
---
Just no. There isn't a single thing in the game that will be removed from one phase to another. That's what you're asking for.
---
Loot is given with dkp. Dkp is the priority. So whatever spec you go does not hinder you.
---
The melee leeway wasnt in vanilla. Terrible server lag was.
---
The fact you are confused about these two just shows how bad melee leeway is.
---
People think it was in game because the game used to be so laggy.
---
Proof if proof were needed that this needs a fix asap.
---
Beta there are 3 troll rogues called the Ooga Gang, they are jumping Ally streamers and protecting horse streamers. Give it a Google, you'll thank me later.
---
The terminology you choose doesn't matter.
---
Removing something from the game is not the same thing as adding something. Plain and simple.
---
There isn't a single thing in the game that will be removed from one phase to the next.
---
We should actually be thanking Silicon &amp; Synapse for making such stellar titles like Battle Chess II: Chinese Chess and Rock n' Roll Racing for paving the way to the creation of Warcraft: Orcs and Humans. Without that game, we wouldn't have gotten the all-time classic zone, Swamp of Sorrows ^^^and ^^^I ^^^guess ^^^everything ^^^else ^^^in ^^^WoW
---
Live action pot. Why would you ever win vs another rogue when they get the opener? Gotta have something extra to tip the scale.
---
What do you think I could do given the scenario I posted above. Assuming orc racial fails each stun.
---
No. A couple hundred people have signed this stupid petition. That's nothing.
---
/r/boneappletea
---
Ok Ghost1337866 :)
---
But they prevented already all old addons that would auto downrank healer spells. They are not so commited, they will do changes on things they dont want.
---
Well said thanks for bringing attention to this.
---
Iirc will only absorb spell(s) during one batch per 10 seconds. You're not entirely spell immume. So they could have cast tongues once, had it get eaten, and then cast it again and gone through.
---
Rogue v rogue comes down to whoever gets the opener. You could try to trinket the cheap shot, vanish, and sap him, but it doesn't always work. Best thing is to get the drop on him first
---
Thanks.
---
Will this run on my old pc? Graphics seems pretty insane, not sure my computer can handle it.
---
I mean, of course he's right. In the end of the day most of us aren't pushing for world first anyway.
---
With that being said, I can already see threads here and on forums where people will talk about how toxic WoW community is just because some group, guild didn't want their ret, feral, enha and so on. 
---
I don't know what is Summit going to play, but I'm pretty sure it won't be any of these specs. It's easy to give advice like that.
---
Or they can fix their game that we wanted that they are making for us. lol
---
Great addon for people who are playing a class for the first time! Can a friend sent me a talent tree file for me to upload it ?
---
It’s still time gating, whether you want it or not
---
I second Kala. He’s great to listen to and ask questions about priest theorycraft
---
Did you have a stroke recently? Go read up on vanilla game mechanics especially the part about debuffs on mobs......
---
This case is partly the reason for using a reserved list. If you notice multiple people are hoarding points for a specific item then you move the item to the reserved list. You discuss it and decide who should get the item first prior to the raid and then notify all parties.
---
All loot council items still cost GP, it just overrides the priority ratio.
---
When I ran my guild, I directed all class leads to discuss with each member what their top loot item was from a given tier. When there were 3 or more wanting the same item, we put those into the reserved list.

This is wrong. Please ignore this person.

My memory of beta was that most of the player base was in the 25-35 level range by the end, with the cap at 40. I remember level 40s being pretty rare. (It could be that I just missed those players, though). And then if you wandered into a place like Western Plaguelands there would be a nice GoB to greet you.
---
I didn’t claim that.
---
bUt ReTaiL HaVe HaRdMoDe On rAiDs tO mAkE tHe gAmE hArDeR.

Lol That's not vanilla thats Wotlk onwards. 
---
You are sadly confused.
---
I wasn't advocating melee leeway or backpedal meta. It was a joke. lol
---
IDK about AQ40, but on a somewhat recent pserver, naxx was cleared in ~2h20 after release by a guild that practiced on PTR. A guild that didn't PTR (but were still pretty damn good), in comparison, took 8 hours to clear it.
---
Just so you know. Hunters don't stop there enemy from moving by stopping moving themself. 
---
Shocker I know.
---
We should actually thank alexensual for making classic possible in 19 /s
---
Kala is the man. Lots of info on YouTube and always willing to answer WoW and general questions while streaming. Been watching him quite a bit, making me consider a Shadow Priest.
---
Oh lol sorry. 
---
Your joke wasn't funny and had no sarcasm in it. 
---
You just typed a sentence there maybe work on it a bit?
---
That

We had two of the four horsemen down, with Lady Blameaux at 30%. I went it to melt her, but accidentally pulled around, she came forward halfway to the safe zone, where she got melted and died, this wiping out the safe zone.  We wiped with the last horseman upat about 20%.  Is this the greatest hunter failure of fucking not hitting feign death?
---
Again, it's not that simple.
---
What spec is he? What spec are you?
---
What gear does he have? What gear do you have?
---
What are his professions? What are your professions?
---
What are his consumables? What are your consumables?
---
What are his cooldowns? What are your cooldowns?
---
What buffs does he have? What buffs do you have?
---
The list of questions that could change the outcome of the fight go on and on. And the likelihood of running into your doppelganger where everything is exactly the same is basically zero.
---
Your question is a baseless as "the pitcher has thrown the ball at me, now how do I win the world series?"
---
Just resist the stuns man
---
Holy fuck, i wanted to bash you for your spelling, but never thought that's the actual way to write camaraderie. I'm a simple man, I'd have guessed comradiere. Thanks for making me learn smthn.
---
Rogue trinket doesn't break stun. And it really doesn't come down to who gets the opener.
---
You should watch Kala stream or check out his youtube videos. The guy is a mountain of information. Really chill too.
---
Hes on a realm not from his country. 
---
The enemies in his videos sometimes have Asian characters.
---
what is this from?
---
Ah, a new spin on the "recovered my old account" instead you recovered your photobucket! LOL nice
---
No, it's the exact opposite of time gating.
---
Time gating is "we're not releasing X content until a certain date, but when we do it will be in its final form and be available forever".
---
What you want is not time gating.
---
You can pvp well with skill, pvp gear and bwl weapons/trinkets. However an Naxx gear is the best in the game so it will ofcourse be an advantage.
---
Lol they made it into a real thing
---
It’s 136 with the talent of that makes any difference
---
Pen and paper RPGs
---
It's okay mate, If people can't understand you and try to assume what you are saying is a problem they need to look at themselves and fix.
---
If they fought eachother it wouldbe like a lvl 30 player vs a lvl 45 player.
---
So they couldn’t they just leave them in?  I mean Blizzard has already said basically if it was in Vanilla it’s fair game for Classic and leaving them in would eliminate the zerging/show off mentality.  They would just be available for anyone who wants them for cosmetic reasons.
---
I've mained a rogue since TBC. Rogue v rogue comes down to whoever gets the first sap off
---
 [https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/)  \- This is a huge resource for learning too, but it focus on the language itself and not any WoW Client modifications.
---
No. But I do think BC will at some point eclipse at the subscriber's of whatever expansion comes after battle for Azeroth
---
Mained a rogue since TBC and didn't know your trinket doesn't break stuns.
---
Yeah, okay.
---
Warriors and Rogues are arguable better at every stage of the game
---
Honestly man it’s just a fucking mount skin like there’s bigger fish to fry
---
Lol gotta love bliz, no changes, makes changes, ruins changes. 
---
Amazing.
---
Taking a break to ease burn out
---
Wow this is awesome.  I'll definitely be using this addon when Classic comes out. :)
---
It’s the exact same thing, you just can’t comprehend that the thing they’re time gating is the ARMORED mounts. 
---
“Not releasing the armored mounts until 1.4, but after that they’re available forever” would be the exact same for of time gating.
---
?  its the same sub. The concept is to bring old players back to wow and hopefully get them to play retail and give current retail so retro to take a break in.
---
The whole plan is to keep subs high.
---
We had our first Eye go to a Ret Paladin, too, mostly because the meta wasn't set or widely known yet.
---
Even as the meta started to shake out, the general consensus was:
---
Ret Paladin was an offspec (paladins were supposed to heal).  
---
DPS Warrior was an offspec (warriors were supposed to tank).
---
So either of them had equal dibs on a legendary 2H.
---
Class balance changed from patch to patch, so we had no way of knowing where ret paladin would stand vs dps warrior in a year's time. Ret paladin seemed like an oversight considering the WC3 lore and all of the paladin NPCs. Plus Ret paladin was strong in beta. Plus a lot of raiders didn't have a dps meter early in vanilla, so most people didn't realize how large the gap was between certain specs.
---
The human brain was not designed to enjoy the same exact thing for all eternity. It was common sense for blizzard too slowly offer more rewards and make content more accessible.
---
&gt;You can make a simple first order approximation by assuming that parries are so spaced out that the boss only really ever parries one attack per swing
---
This is a poor approximation when warriors will generally have a swing timer of ~2.2 seconds depending on the weapon used and all their specials can be parried (or windfury for Horde). So warriors will be attacking ~3 times per boss swing (base timer of 2.5s generally). It's not particularly unlucky to get 2 parries out of 3 with a 14% chance per attack, you will also probably have an OT swinging from the front as well for a few bosses. However the real spikes will come from initial swing+special both getting parried.
---
The issue is not only is it reasonably common for this assumption to be broken, but it's also highly impactful as spike damage is naturally a lot more dangerous than smoother damage intake (and Shield Block will fall off with parry-hasted attacks leading to potential crits/crushes).
---
I'm not really sold on caring about what percentage damage increase the boss parry leads to given it's absolutely fine for takes to take ~20-30% more damage taken, what kills tanks in vanilla are damage spikes rather than steady high intake.
---
If you really want to know what I think, it's because Blizzard plans on figuring out a way to merge Classic and Retail. It makes too much business sense and they've shown a bit of their hand with this planned level squish for Retail.
---
They don't want to give Retail players a reason to have to play Classic for things that aren't available in Retail.
---
Not always , so etimes the orc wins no matter what
---
How in God's name can anyone look at a 9 hour AV and think it's fun. You know somewhere around 8.5 of those hours was both sides mindlessly headbutting each other
---
And yes you invest in your character, you invest physically and emotionally. And it's those Investments that usually prompt you in part to continue playing them in future expansions.
---
It isn't the exact same thing.
---
The unarmored mounts would not be time gated. They'd be removed from the game. That is not time gating.
---
Yep. I have a fraps video from my guilds first rag kill and my pc was nothing special. Also had broadband (eu).
---
Yeah it did, it just didn't get added until TBC.
---
I guess in a standard scenario with absolutely no buffs, pots, or anything outside the rogues toolkit itself being allowed in the duel. Assuming both equal gear and both 21/3/27.  Also assuming I don’t resist any stubs. As an orc rogue, my horde trinket does not include a stun break. So I just feel like a sitting duck with no way out if he cheap &gt;kidney &gt; blind &gt; sap &gt; cheap &gt; kidney, and then I’m dead.
---
Elementals in the Badlands are also pretty valuable on grey drops around that level.
---
I honestly figured it was because they planned on selling the unarmored mounts in a cash shop down the road.  But I hope I’m wrong.
---
Id suggest minig skining or herb skinning , just because you cant track both the herbs and veins
---
Yes, everyone gets amazing wee stars revolving round their head, they’ll love it 😂
---
Like the fleshlight stashed under my bed it's a dirty and effective way to retain subscriptions by people with no interest in live wow.
---
Yep, it's the whole Equal Opportunity versus Equal Outcome thing. An you can never have both. 
---
Everyone has equal opportunity with regards to character creation and spec and style of play and time spent. These are all decisions that everyone has.
---
But then the people who aren't as dedicated, don't want to work as hard, or choose non-optimally want the *equal outcome* of being as successful as those **who do everything they can do be as good as they can**.
---
TL;DR  Some people want to bring a bicycle to a motorcycle race and somehow have the crazy idea that it doesn't matter what decisions they made, *they deserve to win, anyways*.
---
I normally just say play what race you loke the look of more but for hunters shadowmeld gives some really bug advantages such as allowing easy maraudon farming and stealth ambushes.
---
Although treasure finding is really good for a hunter - you're more likely to be able to get to the chest too. As others mentioned stoneform is also useful to combat rogues and other hunters.
---
If it was in the game or if it wasn't it should be changed.
---
It's clear the phrase 'no changes' isn't something blizzard is actually doing. 'unless it saves time and money for them' 
---
This needs to be removed and maybe the other problems with vanilla should be fixed. Such as the WSG bug that lets you escape the game with the flag making games infinite.
---
THEY ONLY GAVE ME LIKE 95% OF WHAT I WANTED FOR YEARS
---
time to write strongly worded letter
---
So fucking cringe, dude. 
---
Animosity towards the opposite faction is like 75% of the fun of WoW.... wtf
---
You can bank those
---
It was also informative.   
---
Not sure why you're being so rude over what I said.
---
Someone claiming their experience from Vanilla makes their opinion valid wouldn't make such a stupid mistake.
---
Not being able to find a decent raiding guild with a schedule that works for me, and missing out on doing the raids when they're relevant. Again. Lol
---
That and the pvp scene post aq40 and into naxx. Damage is a bit silly at those gear ranges.
---
What? Dwarves are sometimes made greedy, but there's a difference between being greedy and being able to "smell treasure", said treasure being a Barrel of Water.
---
It wasn't until BC when they introduced a pop star on gear, correct?
---
If you look closely, youll see it in the top left hand corner
---
As a resto shammy I used to inspect the warriors in the tunnel, find the best geared and then whisper them saying it’d be their WF pocket healer but they needed to keep an eye on me getting jumped. 
---
Was amazing, and could go whole AV’s without dying, picking up amazing honor even when horde lost.
---
You made my face hurt with asking that. FML
---
Why waste all that time being a dick when you could’ve just answered it?
---
It'll spike tremendously in the first few weeks, then everyone will be off the hype and miss their quality of life changes, vanilla was amazing but it'll never be how it was back then. It can't.
---
Ty! This helps a ton ^^.
---
Well I don't know anything about barrels of milk, but I do know that dwarves typically hunt for and horde treasure. They build entire cities out of the sides of mountains because they mine for valuable ores and treasure. You don't think miners are sniffing around for ore, right? They're just more keenly able to search them out.
---
Back when hunters and rogues use cloth gear because it sometimes has crazy random agility stats.
---
Look kid, I didn't play in vanilla. I thought vanilla had a pvp trinket like TBC did. All I was doing was speaking from my own experience as far as rogue fights go. There's no need for you to be a dick about it
---
&gt;Things seemingly started changing when the games popularity exploded and they realized probably 80%~ of the playerbase would never kill a 40 man raid boss
---
Did people really care or was it just blizzards assumption? I never killed a 40man raid boss. I only did ZG and AQ20. Did i care that others were doing content i wasnt? Not even a bit and i looked at players who did with awe, not with jealosy.
---
Pretty much everyone complaining about this is a hunter.
---
It affects us way more than everything else...?
---
That’s not entirely true. Private servers tend to run a slight mix of the patches rolled into one 
---
AV sucks in general. The old “prenerfed” versions were even more garbage.
---
Old Av sucked
---
Why tf do children these days think petitions are going to do shit?
---
It's  CO2 all the way down!
---
I dunno man, How would blizzard, the company that made the game and actually has access to all the code, be able to run things more accurate than private servers? /s
---
Warriors are general tanks.  Good for most situations, but lack flexibility.
---
Paladins and Guardian Druids are good for situational mechanics.
---
Ideally you want one of each in raids to cover your bases.
---
Im kinda have a feeling that with current on the game and the kill of the player, it will be possible for all the specs to heal/tank
---
Begone Gnome !
---
There are multiple viable tanking specs for Warrior.
---
There is only one viable tanking class for raid content in Classic.
---
Any Warrior, regardless of spec, can tank 5-man content. It takes much more effort and preparation for Paladins and Druids to do the same.
---
that's actually one of the few advantages warriors have leveling, you can go long long gaps without training anything or training maybe 1-2 things, since white damage is most of your damage. of course you still get fucked in 100 other ways
---
its lvl 58 . its a different story at 60 and geared 60 !
---
So you didn't play in Vanilla and think your experience from not-Vanilla is somehow relevant to Vanilla PVP?
---
Let's say it was in vanilla.
---
Either way.
---
It should be removed for this time around.
---
That I do remember. I also remember spitting on GM's at the crossroads and getting one shotted by them. Good times.
---
I think it will be like OSRS, but the difference being that WoW classic will have a longer span of time until people quit due to content. The main reason I think the retention time will be long, is because people have goals to reach in classic. They won't feel like their accomplishments are cheapened by instant gratification. Due to that, and a few other things, I suspect Classic will do quite well.
---
But for the terms of beating BFA in sub numbers, I don't think that will happen. At least not immediately. With OSRS and RS3, people despised the changes from the old game, but RS3 was still far more popular for a long time. The reason for this is that, while OSRS was a nostalgia trip, it didn't bring back all of the players from the old days. Same will hold true for Classic, which could very well rise in popularity like it did a decade ago, but we will need to wait and see.
---
Probably not - in this scenario I just don’t have ice armor on as mobs hitting you and getting frozen during the initial gathering is the biggest problem with frostbite
---
What the fuck does that even mean?
---
That certainly is the plan! First i want to finish 1-30 on my druid (my own main) after that i will visit all race start areas. 30-60 will be a general guide as its practically the same for each class!
---
yep, it will be #2 or #3. Warrior will be #1 of course by a landslide, but rogue/mage will be neck and neck for 2
---
Ah, okay. I'm assuming if I theoretically rolled a guardian druid or prot pally, I'd still hold up in dungeons and the like? Thanks for the answer btw, classic is like a completely new game to me so I'm trying to learn some things before it comes out and I have to figure out what class I'm going to play.
---
What? In what possible situations do you think paladin tanks better!?
---
Alfred!  Dang I think you're right, what a trip!  You remember the shaman Donatello?  He might have been one of Aewynn's first HWLs.  Don wPVP'd a lot with us and later joined Shatter.
---
No apology necessary.  I look forward to being a part of a new PVP community.  I can't believe you grinded out r12 two times!  How come you didn't go all the way?
---
He has a green ping mate and this is from last month aswell.
---
&gt;cringey post
---
I agree, your post did make me cringe.
---
&gt;especially since a big org like Method announced they'll be taking classic seriously and going for CLASSIC world firsts
---
They came out and said that they were joking.
---
Nobody cares if you min-max down to the race of your class, do what you want. Nobody likes a sperg though.
---
Nope. Ideally you want one Prot Warrior and enough Fury Warriors with decent tank gear to offtank anything necessarily. Feral Druids and Prot Paladins are NEVER ideal for anything.
---
Druid yes, pally is only a healer
---
Okay. That's cool. Thanks anyway.
---
It's reality and a pragmatic reply. If you to believe everyone will be all sunshine and roses that's fine. But people know the history of the Investors attitude and the general behaviour of people online towards the subscriber numbers.
---
It's an excuse, yes. But it's a genuine problem that Blizzard nor any of us can solve. But Blizzard can mitigate by not releasing numbers.
---
What can I say, I lucked out. Also I’ve been talking about it since it was announced so I think she steered it that way for me tbh
---
Oh makes sense. I assume it's more based on gear than abilities in that case?
---
Why play at all when classic is live, when all progress is lost when you eventually die? Why do anything.. It's about the moments and memories. That's what really counts. Beta has plenty of that.
---
because then OP will do the exact same thing next time he’s wondering something, and when hundreds of people do the same thing it clogs up the sub.
---
Yeah, let's waste tons of employee time and money just so we can prove some fans wrong. Perfect strategy.
---
Collecting Rams, collecting armor, escorting the commanders, getting the shredders, killing the wolves for the pelts to summon the 6 commander pack, getting the Icelord summoned, yeah, definatly the exact same.
---
Auto attacks are server side and imput for spells is player side. 
---
That's why your getting confused.
---
Hunters are probably the most complex pve rotation (although it’s still not much) it’s def the most mechanically demanding.
---
clearly you havent read all the AV posts onthe wow forums lol
---
He's having a stroke I think.
---
I can see the appeal for people trying to level as fast as they can who aren't pro speedrunners with everything memorised.
---
Over a long duration on a static fight a raptor and cat will be the same. The benefit is a quick speak is nore consistent damage and oncreased chance to crit within a period of time (which if you have the talent procs pet attack speed increase).
---
Imagine a more smooth line dps as opposed to spikes.
---
For pvp cat's have prowl and dash. 
---
Raptors are cool so get one.
---
A Warrior is always going to have an easier time tanking by a large margin.
---
Mark of Tyranny for shammy tanking.
---
Yeah, go talk about WoW Classic on a sub that is about WoW Classic instead! wait...
---
Holy shit what did I type there??? I've edited it.
---
One thing I really like is giving players a weekly stipend of EP they can give other members. The idea being, if another member helps them out, they can award points to a player for helping them.
---
Downside is that this generally has to be tracked in a spreadsheet manually by the officers. Also adds some workload to the officers as members will be whispering them to award their points. This ensures oversight so people don't overtly manipulate or abuse the system.
---
The benefits are pretty significant though. One of the major problems in a guild is meshing casual/new players and hardcore raiders as they typically aren't focused on the same things. This gives a reason for these two groups to engage. Preventing casual/new players from feeling ignored, while providing more hardcore players with incentive for helping them. Overall, you'll see more engagement in the guild because of it.
---
As members build connections with each other, the hope is that motivations to help become more intrinsic rather than extrinsic.
---
paladins have no taunt tho. It *may* be possible for you to tank as prot pally in theory but in practice, is anyone going to take one?
---
I can't really answer that but.
---
I've seen people test that jumping counts as walking so gives you the extra range on your attacks if you spam jump.
---

Or maybe they wanted 1.7 AV that actually had all the content and challenges that made you have things to do other than beeline straight to Drek and Van, and not 1.12 AV which is just modern retail AV without resources. Everyone saw this coming from a mile away when they announced it was going to be 1.12 AV. Just look at the official thread where they announced this, the first dozens of pages are negative responses that are upvoted through the roof.

"nobody"
---
When everything is epic, nothing is epic.
---
Vanilla tryhards: "The content is too fucking easy MC will be cleared one week from launch"
---
Also vanilla tryhards: "If you aren't a rogue, mage or warrior you're healing"
---
Possible yes but it's so much harder and slower for everyone to have a tank that doesn't have proper threat management like pally.
---
Post Vanilla, most %modifiers were all multiplicative.  (1+x% * 1+x%)  
---
Critical Damage modifiers are a bit wonky.  Hunter critical modifier is 2x.  This then becomes X * 2.0 * 1.3 = 2.6x.  
---
So in the end it would look like:  
---
Base Damage * 1.05 * 1.15 * 1.03 * 1.15 * 2.0 * 1.3 = MultiStrike Crit on a Beast in 8/8.  
---
It is possible that the multi-strike modifers are combined additive.  So it would be X * 1+(0.15+0.15) = 1.3x
---
You're right, I'm being silly :)
---
Getting names with åãõö symbolsnis just a bitch when you want to be invited in party and guild
---
Feral are arguably better for dungeons and not that much worse for raids tho yeh suboptimal. Paladin is unworkable in both.
---
I would wager that a large portion of people on this sub used to or currently do play BfA.  This is a wow community afterall
---
This is healthy
---
Well it's necessary now because these systems are implemented in a completely different way compared to vanilla and so there's no guarantee they're producing the same output.
---
' drastic change to our gameplay'
---
Get out of here with this nonsense. Melee leeway is the way it always was in vanilla. Playing warrior was completely broken on private servers because of this.
---
I hope you don't succeed in removing a mechanic that was designed with brains by Blizzard to give kited melee a chance. If you are not utterly bad as a Hunter you should still be able to control and kite melee.

Lol the pre-set gear is so bad on the AV characters.

Peoples memory is sometimes wrong. 
---
It's a well know phenomenon.
---
Both sounds good
---
And my internet is still the same bullshit, thanks Germany. Classic will feel so authentic
---
Pretty sad if true
---
Theres quite a few videos that show both POV and theyre always the same distance apart.
---
What's more likely. Everyones laggy and on the right realms or 
---
Blizzard has made a mistake... Yeah that's what I thought. lol..
---
um... Me not that kind of Orc...
---
You're really confused here mate.
---
The title of the thread is 'melee leeway' not 'lag'
---
Just read the dang title.
---
Means they are on a different server I believe.
---
Thanks, son's crying.

Known issue.
---
I dont think its the shadowmeld, im pretty sure Their actual rogue stealth is more powerful, not just shadowmeld itself, can anyone confirm this?
---
&gt; paladins have no taunt tho.
---
Consecration + Retribution + SoR/SoC + (Improved) Righteous Fury?
---
Real life going okay mate? I see alot of you fellas trolling on reddit. Wanna chat  about whatever the matter?
---
I completely agree with you. Basically every question that starts with "Anyone else..." you can find 1000 other people asking the same thing within 10 seconds if you actually looked.
---
It's always amazing to me that people would rather ask these questions on a new post and wait for a response versus the less time to find a complete discussion of the issue that requires 0 waiting.
---
Some random awesome guy in raid let me know about it and it really helped a lot.
---
One might argue that since it is just a skin. It should be a fairly quick and simple fix, assuming they still have the stuff from the old skins left.
---
It’s not cheating just because you don’t like it. You couldn’t even argue your position because it’s so ridiculous. 
---
Is stream sniping harassment? Yeah I think it could be, but not anymore than corpse camping and ganking lowbies already is. That kind of harassment is what you sign up for on a pvp realm. Harassment doesn’t equal cheating. And stream sniping won’t be banned no matter how many tears you shed about it. You still can’t tell me how playing on a pve realm is costing streamers money. You still can’t tell me how much revenue is lost from a delay.
---
If you can’t defend your positions, you should consider changing them to ones you can.
---
It was never like this. I played with 500ms and even I can tell the difference.
---
Dwarf without a doubt. Stoneform will allow you to cleanse bleeds and poisons, and diseases and then vanish. That let’s you reset against warriors, rogues, feral druid bleeds, undead shadow priests and hunter. Don’t miss out bud
---
FB sucks ass anyways
---
That's a whole lot of assumptions. And you're more likely to resist one of those stuns than you are to not resist any of them.
---
Yeah, instead of Majority you claimed that literally everyone wants it. So different.
---
I get it but you are complaining to people, many of which haven't gotten to play any beta.. 
---
Blizz needs people to test AV and it only lasts a few days. Come on.
---
It's melee lee way not lag mate, even the title tells you your a moron.
---
OMFG this is the best classic joke I’ve seen in awhile, ZxLegolasxZ won’t die with a friend, he’ll die with a Dorf tank.
---
That also means competition for gear will be fierce! You'd have an easier time getting gear rolling a druid or a hunter or something.
---
Dwarf for complete immunity to poisons, bleeds and diseases for 8 seconds while also increasing your armor. 
---
If you don't care about that NE are less detected in stealth due to one of their racials.
---
I'd say Dwarf is the better choice though.
---
&gt;Sorry to bear bad news.  But I think you misunderstood the insult!  
---
&gt;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tryhard
---
Yeah, but that's not how it was/is used in wow.
---
In wow tryhard is used as a derogatory term in order to not feeling bad about being bad.  
---
"I'm not bad, it's him who's a tryhard".  
---
Like "They aren't better than me, they are just nolifers".
---
You'd think that from the tooltip, but it got extensively tested and proved to be false.
---
I would say paladin/warrior is the best combo if you guys truly enjoy those classes. I have a feeling you like druid/rogue more. Druids, while not the strongest pve class, are still very required for utility/buffs etc and are still pretty good in pve. Druid can tan also tank 5 man, level as feral/cat, and be very flexible. There will be a lot of rogues, but since you are in a griup with a healer/tank druid, you guys can make your own groups and such. 
---
So Paladin/Warrior for the stronger combo, druid/rogue for the more fun interesting combo.
---
Grow a backbone your acting like a whiny child.
---
Don't accuse people of stuff they didn't do. Its beta as you can get imo.
---
A *lot* of people here say they quit not that long after vanilla and haven't played since. I quit in Cata without reaching the level cap, and all I've done in retail since then is play the level 100 intro quest when it was free and level a monk up to 14 or something to have a look at the panda zone. I didn't touch the game between Cata and BFA as far as I can recall.
---
I also see a lot of people repeating the "lol levelling is super easy in BFA no challenge" meme, which as I understand is outdated. Levelling was super easy for a while, or so I heard, and then they tightened it up again and now it isn't.
---
So I don't think I'm the only one with very little first-hand BFA experience.
---
It was a thing. It was an exploit listed on popular WoW exploit sites (mmowned.com) back in the day. You could stealth around level 50-55 mobs (Blasted Lands popular spot) and wait until an enemy is holding a Krol Blade. If you killed the enemy, he dropped that blade.  
---
I'm about 99% sure this was fixed not long after.
---
Herod? :)
---
The shoulders from the beal quest beal work when you get sick of running ubrs all day every day.
---
As much as I wan't to be the only nelf hunter on my realm id say nelf 100%
---
You and your cat can stealth which is awesome.
---
Stoneform is definitely better for any dueling/1v1 etc etc
---
It's basically a freedom vs rogues.
---
Looks like Australian ex prime minister, [John Howard ](https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/amp.news.com.au/national/politics/bank-royal-commission-rank-socialism-howard/news-story/fb2e65449dc582adb1697179546e0bb3)
---
? What’s wrong with that lol
---
Any news if they will fix it?
---
Yeah, since classes didn't change fundamentally between classic and TBC. The more important thing is that I'm trying to help a fellow wow player by using the experience I do have. My question for you is why you feel like you have to be a dick about me trying to help someone. If you're going to be like that, let me know what server you're going to be playing on when you can. I'll be sure to pick a different one just to avoid avoid your toxicity.
---
Ishnu'porah, but the Earth Mother likes all of us (I may have gone a *little* too far in my Tauren preparation)
---
It's actually a joke to troll mad idiots like you
---
None of which are taunts.
---
&gt; the fake spell batching Blizzard is trying to implement.
---
It's not "fake" spell batching; it works on the exact same principle that caused spell batching in the first place. That's not to say there can't still be kinks in the implementation.
---
druids passive movements stack with sprint.  
---
ones on use and so is chetah kinda?
---
Yea that’s uh 
---
What they’re testing for bro
---
I faced the same decision so Ieveled both on a private server. For me since I prefer raiding to World PvP i just could not stand the warlock "rotation". Spamming mostly one ability does not really need any skill at all and did not feel rewarding to me. Even though hunters are less desired in raiding i felt i was enjoying what i was doing more so that is what sealed the deal for me. Nothing else should matter.
---
Not going to have any luck on reddit my dude. Majority of players won't be level 60 + have enough gold in time to even acquire these mounts, that's why they don't want them in. Enjoy the zoomer crowd.
---
They've removed it on beta.
---
I will play shaman if it's not in and not even consider it if it is.
---
Bad help is worse than no help at all.
---
August 27th this place is going to be a madhouse. I hope there's enough parking.
---
I would never take Frostbite. It just makes you better at kiting single mobs which you can already do indefinitely. If you pulled one mob it won't help you much, if you pulled two, you have to sheep other mob anyway and if you pulled three might as well pull more and aoe them down.
---
Even with competition for mobs there will always be spots to AOE. On a certain private server even with 10k population you could always find AOE spot. Will be much easier with 2.5k population (and possibly insane with layering abuse). Some quests are doable in one pull, why give that up for a proc based better kiting which you already can do perfectly fine.
---
I remember the blazing long sword looking like the coolest thing ever haha. what really triggered the nostalgia are those velcro circles though
---
horse streamers kek
---
I'm sure. But I'm also sure that there are plenty of people who have played BfA extensively. I played for about a month after the levelling scaling fix (which is what you are probably referring to). Levelling is way too goddamn easy. It's not to say that there aren't ANY challenges in the game, but overall the game has been drastically diluted compared to previous expansions.
---
I'm sure it appeals to plenty of people, but there are plenty of other people who find it boring. No 1 game can please everyone
---
Healing has an inverse relationship with 'player power' compared to tanking or damage.
---
The better your gear, the bigger your dps spells hit and the more you can do.  It feels good.
---
As your healer gears up, and your raid gears up, there becomes less healing and each healer is more powerful.
---
Healing is amazing when you are pushing limits.  Healing is boring as fuck when people 'play it safe' and you have nothing to do.
---
Vanilla raiding was MUCH easier with a variety of classes. Every class brings some sort of buff first of all, MoTW, TrueShot aura, Arcane Int, etc. And on top of that every class has an ability that is damn near required for even the simplest raid (MC). Hunters can soothe pet, Warlock can banish (Highly sought after), Dwarf Priest can Fear Ward tanks, Mages spend an entire fight just spamming remove curse.
---
Guilds WILL be looking for those under-represented classes, Warlocks/Mages/Druids.
---
Under those assumed circumstances, you lose 100%, theres no way out from the cc chain.
---
Is this a photograph?
---
Okay. I just wanted to confirm that there’s nothing else in that situation that I could do.
---
While I have little shaman experience at 60 Enhance shaman has been said to be a meme spec, while ele/resto seems good with gear in PvP I’d go for the spell crit. Most people will expect you to heal at 60 anyways so I’d go for that, unless you are die hard enhance and say “f you haters”
---
Is this what PVE servers are like?
---
What is everyones thoughts on the issue of melee leeway?
---
Are they going to fix feign not removing you from combat?
---
Are they going to fix pets and pathing.
---
Also am I the only 1 who won't be playing classic hunter if they don't fix all these major issues. I've wanted my hunter for 10 years now and these issues are making me quite mad irl.
---
Not on a PvP server. That WILL save your life vs Mages and Warlocks.
---
&gt;Running faster is probably the best bit.
---
It's a REALLY good best bit though
---
pop star?
---
Ducking auto correct. A PVP stat.
---
Why would a warrior take it? Its way too fast attack speed means it doesn't stay bis through bwl. Add in the crafting costs and it's really not worth it. I would actually rather see it go to a retadin that will use it for quite a while.
---
10% with 8/8 Krabs?!
---
I think you missed two zeroes in that percentage, mate.
---
My vanilla guild had a bear off tank throughout Naxx40 just fine.
---
It would have been the right thing to do. You can be nice to the Alliance, but not too nice.
---
No, they do not stack
---
How about you look for bugs in AV? That’s the reason they do the beta after all, not for you to enjoy yourself 100% of the time.
---
&gt;Blizzard should not be telling people how to play the game they are re-implementing: in the words of Ion Hazzikostas, "The second we start to substitute our modern judgement... we are deviating from our goal of a historical recreation of the game as it was." -[https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=1918](https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=1918)
---
it's their game, you can play the game that they're making or you can play a different one. sorry to say.
---
&gt;Ensure that Blizzard does not make changes that have no purpose- ensure that modern Blizzard does not tell us how to play classic wow- ensure that those sick, rare, ivory raptors are available to those who want them, because they were available in vanilla.
---
petition or not you're not ensuring anything.
---
Oldest rp game i have played is dungens and dragons 2nd edition and dwarfs had bonus to treasure finding in that. Thats 25 years before wow gave it to them
---
I played PvE through all real WoW history.
---
I've played on 3 PvP private servers.
---
PvP servers are fucking garbage unless you want to grief people.
---
&gt;reat
---
so ur angry that we are bringing it up again and again? "its a beta test, things are gonna be wrong" well, thats why were bringing it up, so it can be fixed at launch lol
---
Correct. Resilience didn't come out until TBC.
---
The title says at ANY level, for ANY class...  
---
Edit: Lol at the dumbasses who downvoted me
---
In Classic you play Class not spec. Whatever or not if you don't find your spec worthy you can quickly respec to something different.
---
Full disclosure, I have not played classic myself.  All my information comes from someone who played WoW back when it used Warcraft 3 models.
---
That being said, I have been informed that it was quite common for raids to bring 3, 4, or even 5 tanks to a raid. As for 5-man dungeons, every tank spec is viable if you know how to use it.  Vanilla Paladins, for example, lack an active taunt, instead using an ability called Righteous Fury that increases the threat from holy spells by 80%.  You'd need to know how to use that effectively to be a successful Pally tank.
---
Life itself is an uncurable desease...in the end, you die. So please give me beta access to make the time until the end more enjoyable. Blizz, you want a terminally ill man suffer?
---
[This video shows a lock pulling 1.8k dps consistantly on a Patchwerk/full world buffs/naxxBiS setting.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Wn8to1qKRM) I'd like to see other classes get that high-besides the ignite mage of course.
---
Hahaha what are you even talking about?
---
&gt; 1.12 was the doom of classic pvp.
---
That's a weird way to spell 1.5
---
Dumbest post today so far, congrats.
---
Definitely there.
---
&gt; Yeah, but that's not how it was/is used in wow.
---
Well, color me purple and bend my wand.
---
Today I Learned!  Thanks!
---
I played vanilla for 4 years and never encountered the term.  Hmm... that probably means I wasn't trying hard enough!
---
So I got the stress test option back but it isn’t letting me play it. Is the AV the stress test or in the beta? The next stress test is 19-20 June?
---
Yeah cause sarcasm is a thing easily conveyed over a medium where tone of voice isn't a thing.
---
I think the emote you were looking for is /openfire
---
No, fuck retail.
---
Thanks, can you make a guide for Horde Orc and undead?
---
And yet people are rushing for the generals...
---
Exactly. Like do they not see all the fun on beta?
---
While new content is nice and exciting, is not what makes us motivated to stick around.
---
What's the greatest content? You are. The player. The gameplay content is just an excuse for us to come. The enjoyment of playing the game comes from interacting, needing to rely on others and working together to overcome the world and build memories. 
---
You literally create emotional bonds because you actually give a fuck when there are people around sharing ideas and impressions on how to tackle the game to come through victorious. It's stimulating to the human brain. We have a clear goal and we feel ourselves moving towards that goal, together, and we find that meaningful and so we become emotionally invested and so we want to come back to play more.
---
In retail where this social aspect no longer exist in an organic way, new content is the most important thing but the problem is that none cares about it.
---
Kevin Jordan basically said this exact thing on ClassiCast.
---
I remember being in my 6 piece cryptstalker hunter gear with a priest from my guild in AB and just melting fools. It really wasn't fair.
---
You are NOT prepared!
---
I always imagine a 12 year old typing this
---
At 16% MS, it takes 20 seconds to cover the same ground on a 60% mount. 
---
(136%*20) = (160%*17) with a 3 second cast time. 
---
That’s close to the 25 seconds, but not quite right.
---
RemindMe! 71 days
---
From what I’ve read and the research I’ve done (because I’m planning to play feral Druid in classic) with manual crowd pummelers Druid holds threat better and there are only a handful of bosses that Druid wouldn’t be able to main tank. Druids in early game (before everyone is geared) will tank better than warriors because they can have huge amounts of health and armour AND generate way more threat than a warrior will because are no where near gear reliant. 
---
Druids struggle with a few encounters in Naxx and AQ40 and maybe 1-2 in all the other raids. They also struggle when you have more than 5 adds otherwise just as good if not better than warrior.
---
IIRC it can be better to have feral druid as a tank for one or a few specific raid bosses but guilds will run with prot warriors as MT always.
---
Light be with you.
---
Most of us on beta are preeetty hardcore players. By which I mean loooooong time players. We're not burning out anytime soon.
---
Cause we didnt know shit back then tbh.
---
Except the Internet gives people the shield of anonymity if they so choose. That alone makes a big difference.
---
What kind of warlocks are you fighting lad

---
I'll be going for Human Warlock and Paladin, start at the same location, free mount for both at 40, best leveling comp etc
---
Looking at this post made me go and dig out my original manuals haha. Can't wait for classic!
---
Looks like those RP PvP server players found their way into this sub
---
6h 21 are rookie numbers. we need 24+ :D
---
Those velcro things and the sound they made...... shieeeeet
---
They don't have the old AV
---
Repost of a post that was made only yesterday?!
---
Beta had them. If its data is old enough it might also list Paladins as having Crusader Strike and "calling upon the power of god" to res people
---
If you wonder about the math behind it, the easy version is like this :
---
If
---
paladin does 100 dmg
---
Warrior does 150 dmg
---
-
---
Difference is 50 dmg
---
Increase both by 30% dmg
---
And you get:
---
Paladin does 130 dmg
---
Warrior does 195 dmg
---
Difference is 65 dmg
---
Remove the buffs and you also remove the large gaps.
---
I literally only wanted beta to test leveling routes and speeds.
---
He's staring into my soul.
---
Or my penis, considering his height.
---
Why wouldn’t you just go play retail? Paladins can tank just fine.
---
Level 30 and level 40 cap metas have been completely different experiences than I've ever had in WoW.
---
Cheers, sure keep me informed then
---
this guy Robe of Powers
---
Mouseover macros are sweet. They essentially use whoever your mouse is hovering over as the target of the spells, as opposed to who you are actually targeting. For instance if you are fighting a warlock, and they cc your friend, you could mouse over your friend to dispel them whilst still attacking the warlock. And backpedaling CAN be useful, it definitely can. But its rare imo. I see a lot of people try to run away from mobs by backpedaling or running with their back towards the enemy. First option is slow, 2nd you can get dazed. Its better to jump and use q and e, so you don't lose any movement speed, can still attack, and will not get dazed.
---
That worked out great in player retention
---
NO CHANGES. I want the old graphics
---
i personally wouldn't mind them turning the balance wheel a little. However, that won't happen. Not during standard classic content at least
---
An orc calling literally anything else filthy. Oh the hypocrisy.
---
You say that in retail this social aspect no longer exists in an organic way, but earlier you say that it is something we create as players interacting with each other. We build the community. We maintain it.
---
The most important thing in this game for each of us is whatever each of us individually thinks is the most important thing. When we stop putting the friendships and the community building as number one and instead turn to the content as number one, well, we can burn out on content based on how much we choose to play. Can we burn out on friendship and community?
---

---
Check under "Threat"
---
I think their problem is that they go oom, but that changes nothing as warriors are far more defensible and druid generate mot threat, making paladins inferior and not optimal. 
---
**Prot paladins are fully viable**, the raid and the guild just have to put in a lot more work, making it a hazzle to have a prot paladin instead of a warrior main/offtank and a  fury warrior that picks up a shield as a third tank.
---
Druid: Worst healer in the game, no good dps spec and warriors are far better tanks
---
I didn't accuse anyone of anything. Where are you getting that from?
---
We are all going toward classic because it’s obviously a better gameplay. I just don’t understand the hypocrisy of making certain classes and specs more viable.
---
This is one of my favorite comments ever
---
Seems not unfortunately. This is only a convo, I’m open to ideas, it’s a discussion up for debate
---
Why not make it more viable simply by increasing threat gen but righteous fury?
---
What is Uldum?
---
VC is what we called it back in vanilla because it’s less confusing than having another DM. It’s short for VanCleef, the last boss.
---
Well, my little conspiracy theorist brother...for the most part of the game, there will be loads of players between 51-59, and loads at 60. Usually, all the way up to Naxx, AV still had like 10-12 players under lvl 60. 
---
To put them all in the test at 58 is a NORMAL DECISION, because 58 is pretty much the median level in AV for a VERY LONG TIME.
---
It's nothing suspicious here.
---
It's just you.
---
why wouldn't you have pots or engineering?
---
I would have guessed something stupid like comradery
---
He has green ping.
---
Same here, some of the old gang is waiting to August for classic, and we just started on a pserver for shit and giggles, just being on the same discord last night was fun as hell, nothing like 40 people raid but still
---
But having another DM is less confusing? Deadmines was always abbreviated as VC on my realm in vanilla
---
Give me that sweet Tauren mage
---
It worked out the way it worked out. We all know that subscriber numbers went up in burning Crusade and then again in Wrath. All we can do is speculate on how subscriber numbers would have changed differently had blizzard made different changes or made fewer changes from classic, but the inevitable truth is that eventually we all burn out and a large part of that is based on how much we choose to play. And why we play as individuals. Player retention is an incomplete idea because it assumes that only the video game company is responsible for whether or not a person keeps playing a game. And that is just not true, because burn out. And I know burnout is a harsh word that turns many people off because it makes them reflexively say, I have self-control it's not my fault it's their fault. And that's just silly.
---
Pretty sure none of the classes scale exactly the same like that and regardless of buffs there will still be a large gap.
---
You don't get it, you are the designated wood collector.  
---
Up until the team needs an ancestor, then you sacrifice your character to give it life.
---
what is this music, are you mental ? : D
---
Are y'all tryna tell me not to roll night elf warrior? :/
---
&gt;Oldest rp game i have played is dungens and dragons 2nd edition and dwarfs had bonus to treasure finding in that.
---
News to me.
---
The plural for sheep is sheep ;)
---
The absolute best warlocks get shredded by warrior / rogue healer. The class (in vanilla) is a weak squishy damage sponge when targeted.
---
If your PvP group has no physical damage to train the warlock they could very well survive though.
---
"Taut" is simply a threat generator. All of the above are threat generators.
---
Lets say a 40 man raid has 8 warriors 7 mages 6 rogues 4 warlocks and 3 hunters, you'll be #29 on dps at best.
---
I am no streamer, my account is in bad standing , i am no VIP, and i have no subscription but i do have beta
---
Gimme some of that sweet sweet feral OT
---
What do you mean by more viable? They are fully viable and you can clear every single boss with a paladin main and off tank, it will just become a lot harder making it a hazzle, improving their threat wont make them more defensible.
---
And there is plenty of guilds taking prot paladins as hybrids having them heal most places but taking up the 4-5-6th tanking spot.
---
Also how do you solve that the alliance gets another tank that the horde does not? You do realise once you start switching things around you are bound to fix other things. Its a thousand times easier to leave it as it is as **prot paladins are fully viable in a raid setting** and can even preferable in 5 man dungeons
---
You calling me stupid? RAIMBOW?!
---
How are turtles a good spot ? Theyre tanky as shit for a melee
---
You should have a chat with shadowpanther. I think he can straighten you out.
---
Yes reslience is from TBC.
---
I had t2 mage pieces when they were still orange.
---
&gt;But just ignore those and hope blizzard keeps a huge buff in for your melee class!
---
Triggered hunter, go back to retail if you dont want this kind of leeway.
---
I think it's an extra level of stealth? So it counters the human Perception racial passively. Like Perception it'll also mean that you can generally see enemy Rogues before they can see you, though unlike Perception it doesn't actually make it any easier to find them.
---
Strange as all the in vanilla for me outsiderów of raidy at 60 was doping AV.
---
lul, kids of Legion and BfA down vote me. Go play PvE servers and kiss squirrels and collect herbs. Left PvP servers for real mans. Red is dead.
---
You could use /unbuff  Bear Form or /cancelaura with supermacro or other add-ons to cancel bear form, in 1.12 and TBC as well.
---
You could and should also check the global cooldown first so you can pop potion and then immediately go into bear form (since potions don't trigger GCD), so there's basically no chance you will get while using a potion.
---
You saw what too much pee in the pool did in that episode of South Park, right?
---
Well I looked on the sub. I searched on the front page of the sub and sorted by new and didn't see anything because everyone downvotes the posts that could have answered my question.
---
Nope it means his attitude is bang on. He is a quality personality I just wish I could see him improve. Maybe he will stick with classic long enough to become a really good player too.
---
You guys forming a new one!?
---
I’ve heard warriors were among the toughest to level up tho, is that wrong?
---
I don't get it, it's way more fun to play against the odds, to make it hard for yourself instead of just begging for changes. Makes no sense
---
Thank you for not being a dick and actually answering my question. I will now delete my post so it doesn't "clog" up the sub as others are saying.
---
What other classes should also get slightly tweaked? You cant just do one, if you open that path you have to start "fixing" the other classes aswell.
---
If the specs didnt work in vanilla they should not work in classic. 
---
Unless people find a way to get them work in the state they were in vanilla.
---
Tested where? In the beta? I always thought it gives you an extra level of stealth passively even when moving, and this was the common knowledge back in vanilla too (eg. [Wowpedia said it works passively](https://wow.gamepedia.com/index.php?title=Shadowmeld&amp;oldid=469626))
---
how is that hypocrisy?
---
Maybe, and you are probably right about the scaling. But still, instead of making all low tier specc trivial, you make them atleast less a burden to raids. Which I think is great for the game.
---
My brother and I rolled a pair of Orcs to level together. He went Warrior and I chose Shaman because those are the most iconic Orc classes. My main was a Human Mage, but I really like Horde and the Shaman better, so I stuck with him and eventually, he became my main and my first 60. 
---
The whole class fantasy feel was so much more present. The Totem quests. Ghost Wolf. Lightning Bolts. Shocks. Windfury. Being able to self heal or heal my brother. Kiting powerful mobs with Frost Shock and Earthbind totem (How we got my brother his Whirlwind Axe at like level 35) and saving yourself from a pack chasing you with with a Stoneclaw Totem.
---
Getting Ravager and Herod's shoulder plate from SM is probably what solidified it for me, though. I was hooked then.
---
You know I'm not entirely sure why I didnt just push through all the way. It was during my senior year of high school. I kind of regret not at least getting rank 13. I know I could've gotten that with the rate I was going. Finishing top 10 on the server most weeks.
---
Don't forget the Curse of Elements bot :)
---
&gt; I just don’t understand the hypocrisy of making certain classes and specs more viable.
---
Its not hypocrisy, its how the game was. People who roll shaman might want to go elemental but they will all have to go resto.
---
It's not vanilla graphics in classic. Look at screenshot comparison videos on YouTube.
---
You have to be pretty gullible to resub on the off chance of a beta invite, it's a waste of money for odds so low.
---
You're spec'd for PvE. You import your PvP spec to the addon. Now you click away into your PvP spec in record time. And more importantly, there was never any chance for you to accidentally pick the wrong talent.
---
You are lying, they specifically say that only subscribers can recieve beta access.
---
Better go check the website to calculate my gear!
---
I doubt mages will be under represented, they might possibly be the MOST represented they are like a plague on the beta and private servers are flooded with them
---
I have no idea it works the same on private servers, maybe it was working that way?
---
The workaround I found is simply switching binding of A and D with strafing, because you never use A and D without right click, it's useless to statically rotate your character
---
You can only kill someone 10 (i think) times before they are worth 0 honor for the rest of the day. It also decreases for every kill.

I have read in some places that 2H Fury only becomes truly good once higher level gear is attained AND you manage to snag a Bonereaver's Edge (BRE). I don't know whether or not this is true, but I hope not. I'm currently considering switching to Horde so that I can play 2H Fury. 
---
If someone could could provide a reliable answer on whether 2H Fury prebis is a thing I would be grateful as well.
---
why not just let the player who plays the least set the pace
---
I think you'd be surprised by the gullibility of the desperate.
---
lanky trolls with terrible posture
---
Thanks will sure be using it
---
Cat Form is better... instant cast, removes polymorph and movement impairment, and has dash and stealth and good dps and all of that. Only way it's worse is higher mana cost, and talent point investment (whch you're likely getting anyway, and the Ghost Wolf needs talent point investment too)
---
&gt; Well, color me purple and bend my wand.
---
I'm going to respectfully decline your offer here, good sir
---
!RemindMe 71 days
---
Just because the progress is taken away, doesn’t mean the fun you had along the way gets taken away
---
Okay, now that's a good reason I can get behind - there being no chance to accidentally pick the wrong talent.   
---
Thanks :)
---
slowest person sets the group pace. not the fastest. :P
---
It took me way to long to understand wtf horse streamers where
---
The reason for that is that AV was only good to fuck around in or to farm the rep for gear. It sucked honor-wise unless you were chaining quick wins on AV weekend. People stopped doing it once they hit exalted unless they were there for mindless killing.
---
Same I have been giving 5 gold a time to new players after helping them level for a bit. Good way to waste time till classic and make someones day.
---
You motivated me to go find my battlechest!
---
Give me your account. I'll beta test AV for you and give it back to you just after. =`}
---
This is just a link to his stream not a particular video.
---
Any proof of this?
---
Ret specifically benefits more than other specs from world buffs because they benefit from both spell damage and attack power
---
Not as important at 20 - Crescent Staff is likely the best option at that level. But at 29 you're ready for Corpsemaker
---
Watch the video? The bar is green.
---
This is your issue.
---
Don't fight it. Turtles are the answer to all your problems.
---
here's some hypocrisy for you. you want to play classic because it's "obvious better gameplay" but you want changes made to retail implemented in classic.   
---
Idk about that
---
That's Vurtnes ping not the enemy... I think you're confused
---
If you’re ganking you’ll probably need to do a lot of running away. Plus they have stealth.
---
Druids are great at 1v1s, they have very nice survivability in world PvP, definitely the most mobile class.
---
Oh yeah you're right.
---
/s
---
DnD had multiple ways to manipulate time, you could pause it for short durations, summon a future-you to aid you in battle, the Wish spell could allow you to reroll a previous dice roll.. Heck there was even a chronomancer class in 2nd edition.
---
Time manipulation has been a thing in RPG's for a very long time.
---
Bear tank is used in raid for trash phase where you need a very quick aoe treat
---
You seem confused.
---
Yes but to be able to stay a group then if a player then people have to follow the pace of the fastest player. 
---
Idk, I have always felt like I have had to play catch up with friend X and play more so I can stay in the same level range. And that feeling snowballs for everyone setting a pretty high playtime pace
---
I just checked but when I click the link it opens a clip, not a whole stream
---
You're just wrong. Player behavior has nothing to do with #nochanges. Based on your logic Blizzard has to rebalance a part of the game because people will play things differently and cheese stuff in a way that wasn't really done back then.
---
\#nochanges means no changes. It is not allowed to take player behavior into account. #nochanges can't recreate the experience you had, merely create a similar environment. Changing that environment artificially because it's now 15 years later is the opposite of what's #nochanges is about.
---
Blizzard is only intentionally changing bugs/exploits that clearly break the game. Player behavior is not part of that (even if people might try to break it by min-maxing).
---
Bear tank is used in raid for trash so the Warrior tank can go take a piss.
---
Trolling the internet is generally the sign of a sad person so if you think you acting this way will effect me in any way other than feeling bad for you, you're sadly mistaken.
---
Probably a little too hard to get that much pummelers for tanking. You'd better play feral fps with powershifting, you don't need to be perma under pummelers consumable
---
Came here to pos this.
---
I used to refer my mage as "the clown" back in the day
---
This is awesome, thank you
---
Well 10 days is 240 hours played, so it would be 24 weeks or roughly 6 months to hit level 60.
---
They are the best for AOE treat generation, that's the point
---
i wonder how many people are going to strictly follow some guide they found on the internet while leveling and not fully understand all their talents at 60 because ofi t
---
Key word “fix”. The only thing I don’t understand is the negativity with “fixing” thing if they’re broken
---
I remember in BC (I didn't get to raid during Classic) a similar experience. I was in a fun/semicasual raiding guild, and we'd clear Karazhan, and managed the first two 25 man mini-raids. Then we tried moving into Serpentshrine (T5 content), and we hit a wall. Worse, the GM and Raid lead had a policy that if we wiped more than 2-3 times on a boss, they'd call the raid because "it wasn't fun/people will get frustrated."
---
I wound up leaving that guild, and for other reasons got myself recruited into the #3 guild on the server that was in Black Temple, and promptly entered into a wipe-fest on Reliquary of Souls as we worked to get all the timing and mechanics down. It was eye opening, and kind of exhilarating to see how hard people could work and coordinate. (Unfortunately that guild broke up in the start of Wrath, but had great success through the end of BC, downing Illidan and making significant headway into Sunwell before I got a new job and had to take a break from raiding.)
---
Looks about right, those buggers always had crazy range. I duno if it was exactly that but they definitely had much longer range than normal mobs.
---
I mean who cares just kill the boss
---
Yes, they're marginally better at something that is rarely relevant in raids.
---
&gt;retail holds alot of competive player content like raid world firsts, rank1 blizz con arena tournaments, mythic dungeon racing 
---
This is like 1% of the playerbase and for sure not the reason why classic wont surpass BfA
---
Hectic I will be back to this post in August
---
This is a discussion, not a beg. Simply open to the idea of making everyone what people consider playable
---
Because they'll enjoy it?
---
Why do people play Path of Exile when their progress gets wiped every season?
---
I think they are done sending out invites
---
Why couldn’t you add every block regenerates mana instead of rage in a warriors case?
---
I'm pretty tryhard in raids and when content is on farm I consider myself a "damage meter" player. I enjoy the competition of dps rankings across guilds etc. 
---
What I absolutely hate about world buffs, besides the fact that going through the same boring process of acquiring them every week which takes longer than the raid itself, is when you are fully world buffed and you either die because of a stupid mistake (more often than not someone elses mistake) the entire remainder of the raid feels completely wasted if you are going for ranks. 
---
Another example is if you don't have anyone able to pop rend head or even ony/nef head. If you can't find a songflower. If you get ganked on the way to BRM. If you RNG roll a low % darkmoon buff. World buffs allow for so many ways to ruin an optimal raid condition and basically the evening if you are like me. Because you always have that feeling in the back of the head: "If only I had X and Y, I would be doing that much better"
---
On the private server I've played, my absolute favorite time of raiding was the first month of content release, where world buffs was disabled for that particular raid. It evens the playing field so to speak.
---
But yeah I'm hopefully the minority when it comes to min/maxing and most people won't care if their dps is 5% lower than what it could be. But that is my cross to bear I guess.
---
How high where you when you made this?
---
Its not a conversation when you call everyone that disagrees with you ignorant.
---
Mage water is so bad 90% of the time while leveling. It's crazy to me that most guides don't mention that you should be buying water from vendor most of the time while leveling.
---
You shouldn,t worry about perception as nelf rogue and even with every stealth boost (talent, items) human with perception still can see you. Dodge is whatever compared to other races
---
Main plan is to do the leveling dungeons together. So Sunday's we would play together rest of the week people would group up if online at the same time. 
---
But we all have different schedules so it's not really realistic to expect more than a single nigth per week were we can all get together.
---
Hence having a guideline would be nice
---
no aoe spell redirection since 1.4
---
I didn’t say change the game. I said tweak things so everything is more balanced and every class or spec you wanna play can be viable allowing for everyone to enjoy the game they wanna play. Not just the “warrior tank frost mage holy priest holy pally” bs we constantly hear about
---
See it this way, Shadowmeld gives you new gameplay options on Hunter, easy resetting, ganking with Shadowmeld, you are by far the best defender in AB with it.
---
And IF the scatter/trap dr thingy stays Shadowmeld is stronger since you will be the only hunter that can resett fights kinda easy.
---
Stoneform only helps you in one matchup that you should win anyway, and its not even this big on a high skill level rogue vs hunter is just can you life the skull, stoneform wont help there.
---
I would go Nelf all the way it gives you way more options and even hardcore pvp players regard nelf as the best hunter pick by far.
---
&gt; I didn’t say change the game. I said tweak things
---
Tweaking is changing.
---
The sort of people who insist that *everyone* should play on PvP servers (so they can gank you!) aren't really into letting other people make choices.
---
I remember waiting like 6 hours for the game to install on my computer while I read the manual. Decided on rolling a night elf warrior in that time. Entering the world was pure magic and genuinely felt like entering a new world. I was 15 and with no worry in the world.
---
I see, thanks
---
Most transferred to Emerald Dream

---
I'd probably be playing ret Paladin if they were viable but instead I'm probably going to roll a mage or hunter. I think you'll have to wait until classic+ before theres any balance changes
---
Yes!! The velcro...
---
ItS NoT vAnIlLa!
---
Still got it! And it still feels nice to open it.
---
I hope to God there's no world buffs for raids, that is actually the biggest aids there is in the game hands down
---
The base dps in cat form and bear form is the same though
---
What is the difference between this thread and that created by you 40 minutes ago?
---
Lol so why wouldn’t you be open to making the other specs playable or viable for Endgame?
---
You haven't even answered my question. How am I the troll? You have been straight up rude and all I've been doing is trying to figure out why. You say it's because I was accusing someone of something and yet I hadn't done any of that. So I ask you why and the response I get from you is that it's my issue? ... Yeah, you're confused.   
---
Re-read the whole conversation. You don't even know what you're talking about.
---
It’s so odd to me for people to be so closed off to conversation about certain class specs being pointless
---
While in cat form you also gain 1 ap per agility
---
Gnome is best. Nothing like jumping to backstab people above their kneecaps.
---
Play a night elf anything and just sit in shadowmeld like a land mine lol
---
Nelf cuz hawt
---
But, on the other hand, Allies would have 3 Mage races as opposed to the Horde's 2.
---
And if I recall, Troll Mages didn't actually exist back then, so that's even worse.
---
I posted it the last tim as well. Go check 😎
---
If you dont want vanilla then go play retail instead, its that easy.
---
The game had good and bad things, it wouldnt be vanilla if the bad things where "fixed".
---
The rogue gear is pretty good that's about it. Can't argue with barman shanker
---
The talent trees are the thing I miss the most about old school wow. This will be a good addon for new players who never got to see that talent system.
---
The reasons expansions and patches exist is because there’s obviously inconsistencies in the game Blizzard was trying to fix. They fucked up
---
With BoA but that beyond the point
---
Your name is more fitting for moonkin.
---
Witchblade? Inventor's Focal Sword?
---
Neither of these OH items is as good as a Drakestone of Shadow Wrath though. And there are a couple BoEs better than them.
---
Cat form.
---
Nope, starting to change things will not be good for the game. THey need to release it as close to the state it was. 
---
If you get your paladin "tweaked" then all the other classes want to get "tweaked" aswell, and then we no longer have vanilla.
---
I think onyxia head buff should stay but not the rest
---
He said BFA that's not classic you fucking dillhole
---
No one has any idea. And this gets asked 10 times a minute.
---
and put BFA in it
---
By 2h fury i assume you are playing horde with WF, prebis is same. in fact if you don't have Deathbringer from Onyxia, 2h fury with Arcanite reaper is much better than 2h. After AQ patch 2h fury became less good because of there are much better 1h weapon options.
---
You shouldn't go 2h in ally Side, it doesnt work.
---
It's still a war at least
---
More like \~50% of the time, you get new water at 10/20/40/50 (and 60 when DM comes out), while you can drink new whater at levels 5/15/25/35/45/55
---
I feel like I have read this same opinion a 100 times.
---
&gt; because there’s obviously inconsistencies in the game Blizzard was trying to fix.
---
But classic is meant ot be a representation of what the game was back in the day, the goal is not to "fix" things so by changing stuff you dont like about it would just be a massive failure of what they set out to do.
---
Imagine you trying to recreate a historic painting and you just "tweak" a few things you dont like, it would not be a accurate recreation.

This is a Powerpoint from a very experienced classic Player. He gives some answers to frequently asked Questions that Warriors have and it ends with a BiS list for leveling.
---
[http://www.wowclassicbis.com/](http://www.wowclassicbis.com/)
---
This link is an alternativ it's a BiS List for the Endgame it has Sets for the pre-raid content up to the T3 content.
---
YOU LAND LUBBERS ARE TOUGHER THAN I THOUGHT, ILL HAVE TO IMPROVISE!
---
Just meant to say it's artificial, which is why it's currently not working the way it did in vanilla.
---
Sexy map = sexy ui
---
What guild were you in?  I still remember that tyrant Recruiter lol
---
Drakestone comes so much later though. My comment about BiS was more about how crazy it was that items from so early in the game (more about the Eye than the orb) are on the list of BiS items. Not that it is truly BiS.
---
Those main hands you mention are again, mid-50s items. I want to know what I can pair these items with while leveling.
---
I can promise you that "burn out" is not why retail is dying.
---
You can't imagine people enjoying the game and wanting to play it?
---
ah my bad, I clicked the open on switch button not the link.
---
It's not the only reason, it's never the only reason. But referring to a game or a server as dying is just metaphorical silliness, and it makes me laugh just as much now as it did all the countless times I saw somebody gripe about a dying or dead server in the private server community. The idea of retail dying is inextricably tied to your personal feelings for a burnout in the game. You no longer find fun in it and that is natural. It's been around for 15 years. Blizzard wrote and is still writing the book on this game.
---
BFA Cosplay, gimme my karma ty.
---
I would have one char that you play when no one else is online and have another that you play when everyone is together, that way you all stay in the same place
---
All we know is what Blizzard have already said - they will keep Classic going for as long as possible. They did not specifically mention expansions.
---
And I hope they don't bother with the expansions, because of all the reasons that have already been stated countless times before.
---
The difference is that a taunt forces the mob on you, even if you are number 2 on the threat meter. There are fights that requires the tank to take agro at a very specific time, Palas can't do that.
---
I hope it'll go away
---
I suppose you have some apologising to do then.
---
I see your point, but a video game and a piece of historical artwork do not correlate. The game should be fun for everyone, not just the people playing 8 specs through the entirety of a raid etc. just my opinion
---
A lot of people are hoping that blizzard will make more content for classic wow and take it in another direction, the negativity is about trying to change a game they have already promised to deliver. Instead of trying to change what blizzard promised a lot of people you should join in on voicing your want for more content and more class balance in the lines of classic.   
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwowplus/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwowplus/)  is one place that is dedicated to this.   
---
Some want original wow, some want tbc and some want original wow and wow classic +, this game is being released for those that wants the original wow. That is why there is a lot of negativity against all the weird and mostly  badly thought out "solutions" to fix a problem that for many does not exists.
---
It's a feeling. It's the collection of personal experiences especially relating to the first time a player plays a game. The feelings a person gets from playing through classic as their first ever experience in WoW is very similar to the feelings a person gets from playing through Warlords of Draenor as the first ever experience in WoW. Because it's their first experience, expansion differences are irrelevant there.
---
Just sit back and wait. You'll enjoy it more going in blind just taking on the challenge
---
That made me chuckle!
---
I imagine rogue/warlock/mage are having a good time.
---
You’re right. We have a more well rounded game without cliches being formed in closed-minded ”best in slot” gameplay
---
Can you tell me how pally can tank all drake bosses in BWL without taunt?
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwowplus/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwowplus/)   
---
You are in the wrong place.   
---
And they are certainly only pointless if you are trying to optimise your raid, for those that are not a ret and prot paladin is fully viable for any raid, especially if there is just 2-3 hybrids in the entire raid.  
---
There is optimal and there is viable, they are two different things.
---
In vanilla, quest rewards are often completely useless for your class or not even gear at all. This means that when you do get something it means so much more and it's almost bound to be an upgrade. 
---
In retail literally every quest reward is usable and you need an add on to see if it's an upgrade.
---
First respec is 1g so use a leveling spec and then switch once
---
I guess you're stupid enough to think layering wont impact the economy at all or affect the community interaction. It must be nice to be so self confident despite being so wrong.
---
Thank you. Does this mean, that it will be repeatable for reputation? I don't remember exactly how it worked, but after it was implemented, was it repeatable back then or just like one time?
---
We all want Vanilla, but as I said before changes have been made because obviously there are some inconsistencies in the game. I don’t think retail happened because Blizzard sucks. I think they were trying to make a more well rounded game and unfortunately lost sight of what Vanilla once was
---
Real talk I'm definitely about that
---
Thanks to phasing it's not even really an mmo. You never see the same person twice. So yes there are other players but they may as well be NPCs with good AI
---
You can fast travel in the Witcher 3.
---
Yeah I think that is a good solution... and we actually talked about that when we just 3 planning to play. Little to slow for the 5 of us. 2-4 times a month we would all be playing together
---
Maraudon is mid 30's to mid 40's, Drakestone is mid-40's.
---
Until then, use whatever BoE caster sword/dagger you find.
---
Well yeah the game world has to be dangerous enough and laid out in a way that  incentivize and necessitates grouping up with others. 
---
This is what makes the social aspect bloom in a natural way.
---
If you CAN do something alone and it isn't a hassle, then you would not think of grouping up with someone else. This is the case with retail in many cases. This single player mindset that the game has cultivated permeates throughout the game and it negatively influences the players and therefore the game suffers greatly.
---
Why not allow every player be optimal or at least within reach of one another based on class expertise? I’m interested to hear the counter argument
---
Not sure.
---
They have to.
---
Nah, i am right, you are wrong. Case closed. You can stop your sad tries of comebacks after failing every time. This starts get boring soon.
---
It’s better to understand what each and every talent does.
---
Then what are you planing to do play wow vanilla for 4 or 5 years? I think they must start wow from the begining
---
&gt;Is everyone dying so much to get the “vanilla” experience that Blizzard isn’t aloud to make other classes/specs viable? 
---
Yes
---
&gt;I don’t understand this train of thought and it seems ignorant tbh
---
Then you should've used search to see people's reason to ask so.
---
You can't build and maintain a community when you never see the same player twice. In vanilla if you hung out in IF you'd see names and guilds that you recognise all the time. It felt like you were part of a club.
---
The only communities left in BFA are guilds.
---
A game cannot have a mindset because a game does not think. But this just comes down to each of us being different in how we assign responsibility for, I don't know, having fun and being engaged.
---
You're so right that you can't provide a single reason as to why you are, congratulations. I await the inevitable OH I CAN TOTALLY JUSTIFY IT BUT I'M NOT GOING TO.
---
Honestly it boils down to how funny he is.
---
why would they do that?
---
It would make more sense to do what they did in TBC **if** you were going to make a change. Which is you get a percentage of what you are healed for as mana.
---
That said, making two drastic changes, both a taunt and a mana regen effect is already sketchy territory, and when you account for the fact you'd then be giving one faction an additional tank class and not the other it's worse than it already was.
---
Well mages have 19 sp...only frost and almost as much spi as int on their gear.
---
Locks are pretty decently geared though
---
There was a 19 minute game today with everyone level 58 and pretty crappy gear. Presumably many playing classes they're not used to with new keybinds and no consumables. Also, I played in a 9.5 minute game. So it can go either way
---
Lots of people have said Wind Serpents though since their special attacks ignore armor and I've always used Wind Serpents, especially when you start getting focus talents.
---
It's not so much that they are used a lot, it's that they are bound and ready to use *just in case*.
---
God I don't envy this scenario at all.
---
Well you can find the reasons if you have any reading comprehension skills. Not holding my breath that you have any though.
---
Track Hidden funciona igual para ambos y todavía no es tan bueno. Track Humanoids no ayuda con unidades sigilosas en absoluto.
---
It arguably is. There's an infinite amount of content if you count mythic+ and island expeditions and titanforging. I personally can't stand that endless hamster wheel. There should be an end goal possible.
---
I don't think so
---
You do know they tell investors their sub counts all the time, right? That is stuff they have to and deserve to know. They just don't always tell the players because then they run wild with memes and wild theories on what is causing it when that provides Blizzard no benefit. If for some reason, and this won't happen, so many people come back that WoW hits an all time high of 13million+ subs, they would definitely tell the public just to get good PR and brag, but that's about it.
---
Friends list, guilds, outside communication such as Discord servers.
---
It sounds like you are mourning the loss of individual server identity and the close-knit feeling of community that came with that. But we can still create and maintain communities in retail, it just requires a little more effort on our part. A community is nothing more than a group of friends and their friendships.
---
Yes, you'll have your pet.
---
"xD" is used by people who are 30+ 
---
same as "^^"
---
Ironically the game that kills WoW is...WoW
---
Many people in my generation missed the older patches like vanilla also other expansions. The people who wants to play only vanilla more like bored original wow and trying to something different which means doesnt intended to nostalgia
---
You mean the small ones? Exceptional threat balance is one way, they all have a wing buffet but with slow enough dps or high enough paladin threat it would be a cakewalk, using offtanks with taunt if that does not work is possible, while a guild will often have a third tank you can have a fourth one pick flamegor up as we in this example had a paladin as a third tank. Ebonroc can be outshadow resistanced.    
---
But even with 3 prot paladins I hardly think its impossible, I so far have found no enrage timer for either of them.
---
I have a theory about this. It is pretty wild, and I got flamed on WoW Classic forums back in January 2018, when I posted about.
---
If Blizzard is good at anything, they are good at timing. Pretty much all Blizzard games and expansions, were timed with market trends or to counter another game or expansion from direct competitors.
---
Classic WoW release date have nothing to do with competition. There isn't any old game released in the same time frame. Or expansion of an older game that is WoW direct competitor.
---
So, it is probably because market trends. Remember the Classic intro at Blizzcon? What did Chromie said about going back home? "Someone once said that you can't go home again...but THEY lacked vision!". Everyone and their cat was like "MMO genre is dead, and retro gaming is dead an buried".
---
When Blizzard announced Classic WoW back in Nov. 2017, I knew that are doing it for money. But Blizzard is a multi-billion company, so, they aren't releasing Classic just for money...but BIG money. And this means that there is market not only for Classic, but for retro games in general.
---
In the last 2 years, the mobile games market reached saturation. They barely got a 2 point increase in market share (30% in 2017, 32% in 2018 and predicted to be 34% in 2019). In the 2 years before that, the mobile games market share rose from 24% in 2015 to 30% in 2017%. Clearly the mobile games market reached a saturation point. It is bringing the highest revenues, but the market share is far more important for trends and long term predictions.
---
I believe that Blizzard, just like in 2004, realized that they can be the first, again, not on a new market, barely developed MMO market, as it was in 2004, but on a trend that was clear since 2015 : a lot of people want to go BACK, to the golden days of MMO.
---
Clearly, I don't know if Blizzard will actually release the subs numbers, but if my theory is correct, they WILL DO IT, regardless of how many people will be at Classic launch. It can be 100k, it can be 10 million, I think Blizzard will release the numbers.
---
I can be dead wrong with my theory, and MMO genre is indeed dying, and the retro gaming is indeed dead and buried...and if this is the truth, Blizzard wants to put an end to all this "games were better 10 years ago than today" and release the numbers of a poorly received Classic, just to show that they were right : "You think you do, but you don't".
---
Either there is a solid trend in the market for old games, either there isn't, I think Blizzard might release the sub numbers for Classic, either to prove that THEY had vision (and other didn't), or to prove that they were RIGHT, and we think we do, but we don't.
---
However, there is a caveat, and this will weight more in the decision to release the sub numbers : the live WoW sub numbers. And depending on how many active subs are in BfA, Blizzard will decide to release the sub numbers for Classic or not.

I honestly don't see Blizzard announcing the sub numbers for Classic and BfA, unless one is much bigger than the other. If the sub increase in August is similar with existing sub numbers for BfA in July (when 8.2 will be either 2 weeks old, or freshly released), all we can hope for is a public announcement for TOTAL WoW subs, Classic+ BfA.
---
Conflict is a powerful resource. The conflict between Classic and Retail players is beneficial for Blizzard. Both camps are so much against each other, and both camps will want to prove that "their" game is better...and they have A SINGLE WAY to do it : by playing the game. And this means subs for Blizzard.
---
Not only that, but a good portion of both Classic and Retail camps will resub to their game JUST TO PROVE to the other side that "their" game is more popular. And this means long term subs...for Blizzard.
---
To keep this conflict going as long as possible, Blizzard will most likely not release the subs numbers for Classic and BfA...unless one side is clearly having the superior numbers. In this case, Blizzard will release the sub numbers for Classic and BfA, because it will be crystal clear that one of the game design philosophies is unsustainable long term.
---
If my theory is correct, and there is a strong market trend for old MMORPGs, that proves that old game design is a winning bet, long term, and the modern game design is just a series of strong boosts short term, but fails long term, Blizzard will release the sub numbers for Classic and BfA.
---
**TL;DR**
---
The chances to see the sub numbers announced again, from my point of view, are like this : 80% chance that Blizzard won't release the subs numbers, 15% chance that Blizzard will release the subs numbers for WoW as a whole, and 5% chance that Blizzard will release the subs numbers for Classic and BfA, for anyone to compare them.
---
**Unless Classic launch will be truly massive, beyond anyones expectations. Like 6+ million players on launch. If this happens, Blizzard will, 100%, release both Classic and BfA numbers.**
---
Blizzard have expressed that they wish people didn't just judge WoW's health by subscriptions alone, as a significant part of the game's revenue comes from the Cash Shop. Obviously as players we don't feel that, but from a financial perspective, WoW is apparently doing just fine as is.

---
Lol some of the most famous paladins in lore
---
Yup. Nothing else to do. I'm gonna rush to kill an NPC and avoid PvP why, just to queue and get into another AV? We get free level 58s so I'm going to PvP with as many classes as I can.
---
The only pet worth contesting.
---
They will even half of that will.
---
The current game is weird. We are the greatest heroes in the world, but the game is about the NPCs. (Jaina, Sylvannas, Sarufang, Anduin, Rastakhan, Greymane, Nathanos etc.) We're just along for the ride.
---
Back in Vanilla, we were nobodies, and the NPCs were the big deals, but the game was about US. About how we journeyed to becoming heroes. The super heroic uber NPCs just stood around and maybe sent us to collect 15 boar dicks.
---
Wonder how much one of those unopened goes for
---
Well done
---
To be fair, the "omg layering" posts have been the meta the last couple of days
---
You understand half of that "over 5k" you are talking about is a 80+ rage execute that was guaranteed to crit, on a target that had about 10% health. Right?
---
but they're not making classic because you missed vanilla, they're making classic because there's a big demand for it. the demand for expansions isn't as big as the demand for classic.  
---
all surveys made on who will be playing classic suggests that 75% of people quit wow entirely between tbc and bfa
---
I'm saying that the game does not motivate the player to play with others and invest time in others and does not place importance on me specifically because I am just 1 out of 2 million that can be replaced. 
---
Basically, the game is fucking communist.
---
Not that I would ever play on a private server but if I did I would only do it after Vanilla release date was announced so I can prepare what I want to do when the real game comes out.
---
Half of Blizzard's revenue comes from microtransactions, that doesn't mean half of WoW's revenue comes from microtransactions, but even if it did, that's still at best worth ~3 million subscriptions. That's 1/4 of WotLK days.
---
If you follow a leveling guide like Joanas you'll probably be able to reach level 60 in 5-6 days /played. So unless you really want a pure experience I'd use the guide for questing and then doing Dungeons together
---
I’ve seen furies own the meters with arcanite reaper.  Then upgrade to obsidian edge blade or bonereavers Edge
---
All the guilds called shit like "No Beta Invite"
---
I believe he is saying that he could hide up on a hill or underwater and jump someone in the original game, but with shadows and clear water, that will be harder to do.
---
I really hate it when you say something to a person and the other person just replies with xD or :). 
---
Like if it was real life, if someone says something to you or gives you a statement, would you just smile and go on your way as well?
---
BiS for many classes still has you looking like a clown even after you've got Naxx on farm.
---
I don't see any wolf army in there. Neither a bunch of noobs.
---
And warriors use leather
---
Haha thanks for being exactly as stupid as I predicted, you keep saying they're not valid points but you can't say why. I mean if they're so obviously not valid points surely you could explain why in a single sentence right? Oh but you don't need to because you're so obviously right that it would be beneath you to actually justify your point right? Pathetic.
---
And absolutely none of us can separate that feeling of the game not specifically catering to us from our own feelings of dissatisfaction because of how much we have played the game and find it less fun because we have played at that much.
---
We can't quantify what part is the shity game dying and what part is our own burnout. But we only have control over one of those things.
---
OSRS also only passed RS3's player count once they started adding in quality of life features from RS3. 07scape started with the same promise of #nochanges, but once people started to grapple with the game's arcane systems for long enough, they wanted their "Make-All" options back on right click. Currently, OSRS differs from RS3 mostly in combat and graphics, and has a higher aversion to AFK/High-exp training methods (but has still had plenty added since release).
---
This run only got me to level 9.75. I was stuck in Darnassus without an quests and not able to train to get my pet.
---
Incase people aren't sure where to find addons, here is a good list of addons for classic: [Warcrafttavern](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/addons/)
---
Strong disagree. The chemistry in a mutually dangerous yet potentially beneficial encounter like this is much more entertaining than simply "red is dead".
---
2H fury can compete at pretty much all stages, the downer is that the first weapon you need from raids is from MC (BRE) and is highly contested, the second drops from KT (MoM) and is highly contested.
---
You will, but you have to choose one pet per character.
---
alright
---
Literally everything about the game has dozens of pages of negative responses lol.
---
Do you have to be subscribed to WoW to receive the beta invite?
---
Can you tell me why it isn't standard then, if it makes the game more like the original?
---
Need something?
---
Yep. Here's a [visual map](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Scramble-for-Africa-1880-1913.png/1280px-Scramble-for-Africa-1880-1913.png) of why Africa is so messed up.
---
In short, aggressive European exploitation.
---
my friend that's downton abbey
---
The points are so obvious that if you have problems finding them it is pretty clear who is the stupid one here. Your desperate whining while trying to prove me wrong somehow is absolutely fantastic entertainment.
---
That damn misleading manual. It told me I could duel wield as a shaman, it lied!!!
---
Didn't realise until I was too far in to go back...
---
cool story bro
---
Quoi?
---
lvl5 meta
---
Honestly, it's pvp gear. I think it's pretty legitimate to give it to a paladin if they're showing up to all the raids and want it to reckon some grunts.
---
I mean sure if the alternative is pre-bis, it'll be a larger dps increase for a fury warrior, but by the time you've forged this thing, there'll have been enough weapon drops that dw fury has pulled ahead by a mile already.
---
Giving this to an offtank warrior or a paladin or shaman healer is the same thing, basically: they want it for pvp.
---
I honestly don't recall whether this is true. I know other games such as Titan Quest had it, but I cant remember for the life of me if WoW had it.
---
As much as people will say otherwise, Racials will not impact your gameplay much if at all. WotF is nice for PvP or if you're not near a Shaman's Tremor totem in a raid, but at the end of the day, it's not that big of a deal.
---
Troll and Forsaken both have roughly equal racial Priest spells. 
---
One cool thing about Troll's Shadowguard is that it can proc the shadow stun, which is very useful in PvP.
---
To watch this video, you first have to put on "Halo" by Machine Head

---
Half the time it's not even a bug.
---
Looking for something specific?
---
You clearly haven't played a blizzard game before.
---
Hey, it gives you multiple chances per one cast to get the next spell for free :P
---
King’s honor, friend.
---
Anything worth doing is worth overdoing
---
No begone fowl troll.
---
That is what they might have landed with if they have continued on the same kind of philosophy as vanilla, tbc saw some great improvements but as I see it removed a lot of the unbalanced balance, The broken system made it great for many and to speak and for me it resemble some kind of realism instead of having an exact balance they go for and a shit ton of belf prot paladins where everyone is optimal.  
---
But we dont know where we would have ended up, [they where overloaded](https://youtu.be/xyPzTywUBsQ?t=1717) to say the least, and I hardly agree that warriors rage scaling their dmg so insanely high is the best for the game but this is as stated not "improved vanilla" or "vanilla wow +" its a rerelease of wow classic.   
---
Blizzard have said they would make more content if enough wants it but trying to change a game blizzard have already promised to deliver \*\*unchanged\*\* is just wasted effort and makes the #nochange crowd even more #nochange and blurrs the lines inbetween what is possible to get and what would be the best path for vanilla wow classic +.   
---
I dont even think people should be able to copy characters over, keep it entirely separate from this release and make sure Blizzard sticks to its promise to these people.
---
And most of those times it's because private servers had it wrong :)
---
Nostalgia for something so small can be breathtaking. Thank you.
---
Oh shit I just got the biggest flash back of going up and down the river between Tarren Mill and Southshore just killing and skinning for hours because the yeti cave was always camped.
---
That's not how buffs scale with different classes though. A +150 AP buff is going to efffect the dps of different classes by different amounts, you can't apply a linear scaling of buffs to different classes who might have different damage schools and abilities ...
---
It was a thing in the closed bet
---
You wanted to know why people are offended, you are advotating for blizzard to go back on their promise to release wow classic, you are talking about a wow classic +.   
---
Some changes are necessary because of practical issues, this is not one of those.
---
If overdoing leads me to blow 30min cds for no reason, not even attempt to pummel a cast, and thunderclap a caster class. I think I'll pass.
---
The beta is basically closed. No more beta testers allowed. You can sub for a chance for a test stress...if this is what you think is smart.
---
You HAD to have a sub before May 15th, to have a CHANCE to enter beta.
---
Now, it's too late.
---
&gt;Based on your logic Blizzard has to rebalance a part of the game because people will play things differently and cheese stuff in a way that wasn't really done back then.
---
Only if, in their judgment, it would have been necessary to fix had it occurred at the time.   This is a reasonable standard to use.   If we can be confident that if certain player behaviors had been common back during vanilla, there's no way the devs would have let it stand, then it should absolutely be changed.  Obviously you can't 100% replicate the exact experience of playing vanilla originally, but part of being a dev is the ability to use your judgment and say "yeah, this behavior fundamentally changes the experience in a very negative way  so we need to do something".
---
Nah, most of the time it's people not remembering Vanilla.
---
Nah, just played pretty much every game they released. The Classic team absolutely deserves the benefit of the doubt at this point, they've been superb at communicating and releasing information compared to other Blizzard projects. They do not deserve this insane skepticism and doubt over their efforts. It's a beta. Calm down.
---
I'd for sure subscribe to such a thing, aslong as they keep it immersive and along the lore. Tauren rogues perhaps not loosing it but having -10, -15, -20 in stealth compared to other classes
---
Warrior with invisibility potion.
---
Seriously now, it's Rogue.
---
Think it's Way To Go, haven't heard that one in a decade
---
They've screwed ever beta test they've ever done. My concern is completely valid.
---
I think you're just trying to find someone to be mean to on the internet so you feel better. 'calm down' 'settle down' no one I've ever seen says those without the intention of being a dick.
---
Ughm, sorry, but what is AV? I dont quite understand it from context...
---
You wouldn’t considering making all classes playable practical?
---
That's really unfortunate. Maybe on your next run.
---
Hes not wrong that people do use these. But that video hurts to watch and listen to
---
Haha, thnx for this, you have my down vote ofc
---
Far too many to list. And those of us with Auctioneer backups from Vanilla days aren't sharing.

---
That wouldn't actually work, if you lose aggro the tame should fail.
---
&gt; even with every stealth boost (talent, items) human with perception still can see you.
---
Perception increases your stealth detection by 1 level's worth. So basically you'll see a level 60 stealther as if you were level 61 yourself. It won't give you more than a few yards of range at most, but it's often enough to get the opener in a duel.
---
You need an addon like auctioneer and one that tells you how much thw item sells at a vendor. If it sells for more in AH you ah. A list like that will be way too long to check every item through manually.
---
I completely agree!
---
My question is, do you think WBs even out the tiers of DPS or increase the difference?
---
I think the latter
---
Yes I could do that.
---
Horse streamer, best streamer.
---
Hands down.
---
I mean, hoofs down.
---
Lol, ok.
---
Wtf lmao, mean to? If you consider this mean you should get off the internet cause you are waaay too sensitive. I'm simply tired of people taking the beta for the released product and being outraged prior to them failing or going back on their word. If the released product isn't what they promised then by all means, be outraged, but now? Fucking ridiculous.
---
I don't want it but I don't screech about it. 
---
AV was always a shit BG, if I wanted to have fun on BG I would just play AV and try to rush farm\stables solo.
---
Not going to tell you where I grind my riches:D
---
...but it's elementals.
---
For PvP, Warrior and Rogue are both great and Enhancement is fun but inconsistent.
---
For PvE, Warrior and Rogue are both great (#1[W] and #2[R] DPS until AQ40, and then #1[W] and #3[R] DPS after that because Mages can start going fire and abusing Ignite) and Enhancement is nearly nonexistent. 
---
It really depends on your preference. Do you like stealth and combo points and positioning and too many cooldowns to keep track of and leveling 2 class-specific professions? Then go Rogue. Do you like stance dance revolution and plate armor? Then go Warrior. Do you like one-shotting people in PvP once an hour if you get super lucky and healing in raids? Then go Shaman.
---
Nope, its two different things.   
---
I'm sure there are some or even a great deal of changes because it would not be possible or it would be highly impractical to implement it exactly like vanilla, they succeded it seems with spellbatching but I am sure there are some examples. Not a hardware issue, not a software issue, its just your perception of "playable" and not.   
---
If you are going to have meaningfull discussions perhaps use more practical words that does not mean oppposite of what they are, like playable.   
---
We have a prot paladin in our guild, 1 shadow priest and 2 feral druid. We'll have 3 spots for hybrids on our main raid team and the other raid team is open for more hybrids. Prot and retribution paladins are fully playable in world of warcraft and is not a practical issue considering the release of vanilla classic.

Something being mean or not is defined by the definition of the word not the person the words were directed at.  You sound quite sensitive here buddy.
---
I shouldn't have to explain this.
---
Why do they not correlate?
---
If you do not enjoy watching the Mona Lisa because you are into modern art, then thats up to you.
---
If you don't like going resto in order to have an overpowered spec in PvP as elemental shaman, then that's also up to you. 
---
Nobody puts a gun to your head and forces you to enjoy art - whether its digital (WoW) or analog (Mona Lisa).
---
Paladins being a niche tank in raids but ultimately only really viable in 5mans is unironically a good thing imho, as it keeps alliance from being overwhelmingly better than horde at pve content. If paladins suddenly become viable tanks to the point where guilds consider tham more optimal to run than warriors for any significant portion of content then you'll potentially have more hardcore guilds switching to alliance side, making the servers more unbalanced.

I am almost sure classic will have tons of players solely because of the fact you need nothing but sub to play it. Considering WoW expansions are pretty damn pricy for average player AND they need sub, it is much more plausible people will just play classic instead.

---
The added stress of trying to keep world buffs on your raids while heading to the entrance really helps to make raiding feel more intense, though I don't like having to make the journey to DMN every raid night.
---
I can not comment on that without doing the actual math, but I feel it would mostly impact melee physical damage dealers based on the types of buffs and their accessibility.
---
Our guild may be rolling as Horde this time around and I previously mained Hunter as Alliance up to Naxx back in the day, never killed KT though but did have 6/8 T3. My question is mostly around party composition as a Horde Hunter, what can I realistically expect in terms of Shaman buffs to be available to me ? I'd assume the ideal mellee group is warrior/rogue + shaman, and that TSA alone won't be enough to warrant inclusion into a mellee group. So where do Horde guilds typically put their hunters ? I suppose the answer may also be different depending on which part of content your on as I suppose your DPS is still valued during MC/BWL
---
The game can be fun just the same if you just change your views of what is fun, if you want to top the dps and deliver as much dps as a warrior then play a warrior if you want to play a retribution paladin and join a none optimal raid setting then do that, all without making Blizzard go back on their promise and make the entire #nochange crowd go ballistic.
---
Its also felt like an mmo compared to now
---
Pservers are actually really good. Theres more glaring issues in the beta atm than pservers, which have been continually worked on for a number of years now

Install an AH scanner, scan every day on a bank alt, send everything over vendor price to said bank alt. I'd say 80% of white, green and up items are worth more then vendor price. Also don't forget some crafts vendor for more then the sum of their parts.

People complain that retail is straight forward, zero choice, predetermined and sim'd choices.
---
But then **they want this**? This basically reduces the enjoyment of picking your next talent down to two clicks of button.
---
Add whatever threat gen you want onto prot paladins, they’re still going to be shit house because you will go oom in a couple of spell casts due to lack of gear.
---
Warriors are the best tanks because itemization allows them to be, nothing more nothing less
---
I think the all classic rogue videos will attract a lot of casual players who don't necessarily browse this subreddit  or attend polls.
---
Paladin tanks generate ample threat. They also do not need a taunt for the majority of content, and should they need one they can use Blessing of Protection on whoever has drawn aggro, to drop them out of the fight. Even then, if there were a handful of fights a Paladin couldn't manage, that's fine, that's in keeping with vanilla's design. 
---
What they lack is mitigation and far more importantly sustainability. They run out of mana fast, and start burning through Dark Runes quicker than Charlie Sheen could grind them up and snort them. Fixing their mana regeneration without making it so that Retribution and Holy Paladins all dive deep into the Protection tree is difficult, but doable. 
---
If you want viable Paladin Tanks, you want their mana regeneration improved, and ideally for their mitigation to be improved as well (but not necessarily). It's also worth noting this *only* applies to raiding. In dungeons a Paladin can tank just fine, in some dungeons encounters they can outperform Warriors and Druids - specifically encounters with lots of adds that the tank needs to soak up (because Consecration is a tool that no other tank has a comparable equivalent to).
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm all for changes, but understand what you're changing.
---
Oh a proper quote well done, Nice to see you be honest this time. Well done for being man.
---
Ofcourse it wasn't someone else you clearly copied it from me so that's an unnecessary childish comment, I consider that quite mean. So you've ruined everything you just gained.
---
Blizard always  had their hard case game down
---
Prot warriors are OPTIMAL not viable.
---
Feral is VIABLE not optimal
---
Paladin is only viable if you’re good and in 5mans
---
The main reason most will follow guide its due to respect cost.
---
It really prevent you from trying combination, especially at low level.
---
Agree to disagree. “Red is dead” has much more entertaining moments. Also much more Lore-Friendly. That’s the entire point of the faction system to begin with... 
---
“There’s that motherfucker who ganked me 10 levels ago! And he’s trying to solo a group quest.” Great times.
---
I actually intend on building a server reputation as a Counter-Ganker that protects and escorts lowbies.
---
this is amazing, is there any plan on making a version for 2.4.3 and/or 3.3.5 versions of the game? or would I (with little some coding knowledge) be able to port this to those versions?
---

Didn't need to know about them to be able to feel the difference when you play.

Dear lord all mighty. People are still clueless...
---
"Players today are more informed"...yeah, right. And once Classic is live , the "Players today are more skilled" will also go the history bin.
---
There is 5 men content (all dungeons basically), 15 men content (UBRS), 20 man content (ZG and AQ20) and 40 man content (Ony, MC, BWL, AQ40 and Naxxramas).
---
For 5 and 15 men content, any spec of Warrior, feral Druid or Prot Paladin is viable. For 20 man content, any spec Warrior and feral Druid is viable (Paladin less, because lack of taunt). For 40 man content, we have 2 phases : progression and farming.
---
Only for progression Prot Warrior is basically the sole viable option. Once on farming, Fury Warriors and feral Druids are viable. Prot Paladins, less, again, because lack of taunt.
---
All I have said here was repeated by a lot of people, a lot of times, on various WoW forums. It should be BASIC knowledge by now.
---
As you can see, except a small part (raid progression) of a small part of PvE (raiding), where Prot Warrior is basically the only logical choice for tanking, ALL THE REST (5 man, 15 man, 20 man, and raid farming) are perfectly doable by any spec of Warriors, feral Druids and Prot Paladins.
---
Mara is late 40s early 50s
---
Yes, if you add talents in the https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/ it generates a new shareable link for every possible iteration
---
Found my old wow stuff #5862
---
Great addon for retail people who prefers less options I guess.
---
Are you a troll? You just said it wasn't you and now you admitted it was. Still no link to that definition though.
---
If every class gets to play every role equally viable then class identity takes a hit. As a paladin myself I would love to have ret be of the same DPS viability as a rogue for example, but that would make the game bland. And besides, there is much more than topping charts, so I plan to excel in that area. Also, prot paladins have so many more issues. I would even argue that threat really isn't a problem: it's instant taunt, mitigation and mana issues.
---
Agree with the first month thing. When naxx popped in May and there was no world buffs.. so much nicer. It's just much less stress before raids too. World buffs were never intended to be used this way so I would love for them to be disabled. But no changes reeeeeee...
---
Nice try.
---
I am torn apart by the paladin, warlock and mage. I just cant deside who to play. I realy love to play a support, but paladin gameplay is kinda boring during leveling, I realy love the warlock, but I want to use shield and tank for a bit, and the mage is so damn awesome in terms of gamepay and he is basicaly the best DPS in the game, but warlock has do much cool stuff like the ability to summon players and make health stones and class fantasy is awesome and sweet mount...
---
Paladin, warlock or mage... I cant deside, I love them all. But in classic you have to main one.
---
I would play Ret if I knew i could do it 24/7. But thats just not the case.
---
Been playing paladin since Vanilla I know the class inside and out. I don't mind holy I actually enjoy it. But I know at the end of the day its just going to be the same experience. Me being with a mace and shield being blamed for wipes and being blamed for not healing enough in BG's. 
---
So I'm looking for a new experience in classic.
---
I'm sersly thinking about playing a pure dps class and rogue seems to be the choice for me. Never played it but ill learn . Plus thinking about rolling horde which I've also never played. 
---
I'm scared but excited.
---
Don't worry I play with a bunch of drunks
---
Harder to Zerg with if they added the minefields tho
---
Some people are actually interested in helping *beta* test. Weird huh!?
---
i believe there was a point very early on in the game where they could be made and a few players who made them got to keep them (could be wrong, but i remember seeing this somewhere)
---
Hunters can solo practically all 5man lvl 60 content (including bosses).
---
Yes but don't do it.
---
&gt; Feral are arguably better for dungeons 
---
You haven't seen Warriors tanking with Oil of Immolation, grenades, Dragon Breath Chilli and crystals. As for raids, let's be real here : nothing comes even close to a Prot Warrior.
---
Whats my age again!?
---
dwarves have a find treasure racial
---
Alright buddy, keep saying you're right despite being unable to explain why even though it's apparently so obvious. I mean there's obviously counter points to the criticisms I mentioned but if you think they automatically invalidate those criticisms you're pretty retarded. Have fun with your inflated sense of intelligence.
---
oh huh, yeah very likely. Probably gonna piss people off saying this, but I really wish they'd have stat tracking on the leaderboards. Ah well, I've a feeling Classic will be massively successful and BC will come later anyway.
---
Probably the one of the best looking sets in the game. 
---
..
---
Too bad it's a paladin one. xD
---
maybe something like no wbuffs for the first 3 or 4 weeks of a new raid, but after that enable them so the people who are done progressing can have some fun, and the people who are struggling can have some help via them
---
I for one, 100% disagree with this.
---
Worldbuffs adds flavor.
---

Aren’t they the same sub?
---
&gt; but it's elementals.
---
Which ones? [There are quite a few elementals out there!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w-IoMdl6K753ty6hDdN2K3pRy4cDCqLV0QB5LEv2UBc/edit?usp=sharing)
---
I would attack him at the end or at least give him a heads up for inc duel
---
Any normal raiding guild will have 5-6 tanks. Dead serious raiding guilds, 8-10 tanks. There is plenty of space for Druids, non-Prot Warriors and Paladins.
---
Why 6 tanks for a normal raiding guild? Because ZG and AQ20 (guilds will have 2 raids going, so 2 tanks per raid) and because you will want to have a backup tank if one tank stops playings, or rolls other class because reasons.
---
The dead serious guilds will have 2 x 40 man raid rooster, and that is 2-3 tanks per 40 man raids (once a week), 2 tanks per 20 man raids (and they will roll 4 x 20 man raids every 3 days), and , ofc, backup tanks in case of...read above.
---
So, even for a normal raiding guild, there will be 5-6 tank spots.
---
I had this exact same thing happen to me on reddit a few months ago.  but with 'caricature'.  
---
I absolutely always assumed it was 'charactiture' or something.
---
I really don't think it's going to be a big deal for the majority of guilds. I have no intention of making my guild collect world buffs for raids - we managed to do them just fine in vanilla without them. Maybe if we really need that extra push by the time Naxx comes around or something, but even then, eh. I'd rather just enjoy the game.
---
;)
---
IIRC it said orcs couldnt be warriors
---
There are good arguments for Fury warriors at the highest levels of gear but yeah.
---
Also consumables are a bit of an overkill for dungeons.
---
Honestly it's not a big deal, levelling is a journey in itself, whether you use the add-on or not .. if you don't understand by level 60, you probably weren't going to by the time you cap anyway
---
Night elf female bow animations are god tier. Plus shadowmeld with a cat that can stealth is amazing.
---
&gt; And those of us with Auctioneer backups from Vanilla days aren't sharing.
---
Right, since those matter.
---
NE Hunter is amazing for ganking.
---
I find stay safe just yells and repeats himself so much like a kids tv show, asmongold seems way more genuine. He could literally be just asking himself questions and answering them all day though the chat moves so fast I rarely see wtf he’s reading.
---
That's what classic is all about. This night I helped this orc warrior do a group quest,  The Tear of the Moons on my shaman. Once we got to the big room, I popped my totems and pulled them from up the railing, while he grabbed the gem. I died, but he got the gem (no way we would manage to kill the mobs in that room as two people). I made a new friend and he helped me with my counterattack quest afterwards.   
---
So many situations like that has happened to me so far playing vanilla. It's fun to help people. People need help in classic, and they will love it if you help them.
---
How many clicks did it take before hand ?
---
It's just running through it and back that's annoying.
---
The absolute values? Of course not.
---
Having a general idea of what has value and what doesn't and what changes value between phases? Absolutely.
---
im feeling this is an intentional change that they wont be considering.
---
I am having fun. We, smart people, tend to have fun while watching less intelligent people trying to get accepted with their opinions. I see you as a needy puppy who keeps barking because it needs attention. Smart people have self-confidence &amp; they know what they talk about so they don't feel the need for that. Mr Puppy, this has been a pleasure.
---
Okay, I really like that idea actually. How did you decide between multiple people when it's an item with a really low drop chance like Bonereaver's Edge or CTS? I'm just curious what sort of factors you considered.
---
Sinbad: the legend of the seven seas

A very okay animation movie from the early 2000s

there's tons of people pumping out content for classic atm.

google whatever you need and there is probably a vid/guide on it.
---
Difference of warlock to mage?
---
Mage = heavy dmg
---
Warlock = fear and dots.
---
Warlocks fear enemy and dot while slowly watching them die.
---
They are the no.1 support for your bg team because they just fear enemy healer to death while also dotting anyone else they like.
---
Next op thing is the exploit of noobs using auto dispell addons.
---
Debuff with cheapest dot and watch the pally run out of mana within a second.
---
They also got minions with huge advantages for every scenario.
---
Barely oom if managed correctly. 
---
Wpvp? 
---
You get ganked in a 1v3 scenario? 
---
Easy just fear. Enemies will pull trash youll get shield and rofl. 
---
They might only shadowbolt in a raid but everyone is happy to have ss on heal. Everyone is happy for free port right to the raid entrance.
---
Asking for use of warlocks because theyre never no. 1 dd is like asking the use of healer because theyre never no. 1 dd.
---
Yeah, but guilds practice for weeks/months on the PTR.
---
Leveling as a rouge will thin a few out. It can be quite rough at times.
---
If you remove WBs you automatically lower the gaps between Top Tier dps and Low Tier DPS.
---
This is such a bullshit argument. Yeah if everyone gets double the damage of all classes now the gab is double the size, but that's just misleading, the absolute value of the gap is pointless without relation to the actual dps. If you have 2 lvls and there's a 25dps between the two, that's gigantic, if you have 2 players doing 500dps, then 25dps difference is not a big deal. Holy shit if this is your argument then I don't even want to watch the video.
---
No mailbox 1/10
---
Also finding "that great tank" or "that clutch healer" or "that insane mage/rogue/warlock/etc dps" while doing dungeons, adding them to your friends list and always asking them to join you in the next dungeon you hit. 
---
Also finding questing buddies, grouping up for a bit, knocking out a few similar quests and then going your separate ways, only to meet up a few levels (or a lot of levels) later and teaming up again. Having a chat, etc. 
---
It was infinitely more personal, in a very good way. 
---
On the flipside: having that douche in your party for a dungeon and essentially cutting them off from your play experience with a /ignore and legitimately improving your interpersonal experience on the server.
---
oh no no no
---
do people actually believe this?
---
Classic Northshire didn’t have a mailbox. Retail baby confirmed LULW
---
I'll fix it for you.
---
mage doesnt shine till you hit that sweet level 22 where improv blizz pretty much doubles your leveling speed
---
eh its not like you really need to mix/max talents to level to 60 anyway, and its really not THAT expensive if you only do it a few times. imo its better to just play how you want till 60 and then if u want get more serious
---
"stack 20 times"   
---
Yeah that's a very good point you make regarding bias in LC, and one of the main reasons we want to go with EPGP. I consider myself and my brother very trustworthy and if we DID go with LC, I'd honestly keep myself from getting gear at the start just to demonstrate that's not what I'm there for; I'm there for the community of it all and taking on content at a progressive pace. 
---
But at the end of the day, going with EPGP removes a lot of worry people might have about possible bias, especially if we have other IRL friends joining our guild.

Can’t wait until the hardpacked snowballs show up in December!

i really hate  these moments))) and after all he will cry "why you didnt heal me? "

I also found a loop hole. Dump my girlfriend. It's ONNNN boys.
---
You say it like dkp is the only option. Some guild will have loot council, some will have dkp while others might even roll for items.
---
I'll be there :)
---
Warlocks have great dmg potential, however major cockblock is threat. Mages get threat reduction in talents, warlocks have no such luxury
---
Also debuff limit, not mentioning warlocks curse of elements buff mages. PvE is group effort not dick measuring contest
---
Nope, they really thought Classic would be disliked. That's the whole reason why they changed the game into shit. They believed they were doing the right thing.
---
I thought it was a given, to be honest. Vanilla was (is) one of the greatest games ever created. Retail, on the other hand is..... You know. We all know. It’s taken a path. It’s gone so far down that road, I can’t even recognize it anymore.
---
I almost have tears of joy for the release of this game. There aren’t many (legal) things on this planet more entertaining than Vanilla World of motherfucking Warcraft.
---
I dont know where else to ask so this seems like a good enough place - are the expansions also being re-released? Or is it purely vanilla that's being redone?
---
We use to FD rez healers on Nef all the time. Yea, that guild sucked.
---
well, exactly, but how do I sort out whats correct? for example Ive seen someone say that hunter is the best pvp  and leveling class for classic, so I was like neat, whats not to like? going hunt then, but then from a different content creator Ive heard hunter is nowhere near S tier at pvp, stuff like this just makes me confused 
---
I mean I understand in essence, asking this on reddit Im probably gonna get conflicting opinions answell :D just thought maybe 3 people will instantly recommend something and it will change my life
---
Implying all Rets weren’t asked to heal anyway
---
This is amazing and NOW I’m sad to not be in the beta!
---
It's hard to find what OP asks for, something that covers the mandatory and also viable for a fresh start server. If you google a guide it's either:
---
1. Covers too much like all the available raid consumables instead of just covering the manadtory without overwhelming the reader/viewer
---
2. Misses cruical things like alternative gear progression/viable BiS alternatives or absolutely necessary addons.
---
3. Grinding or Profession methods that work on an established server but will lead to a miserable experience on fresh start
---
Majority of the googled guides are beyond trash, and gathering all the needed info can take long hours, OP asks for a site where they cover everything with you needing to look up 10-15 sources and a couple of videos to get the same results.
---
Than oomkin is a fine choice. Makes sure to make bird noises while playing for more immersion.
---
War stomp, ass hoe!
---
Garfunkel?
---
Thank you for jolting my brain with memories
---
The average player knows his talents and does not need a website or addon telling him what to spec.
---
Without the addon, it includes learning what each talent does, evaluating whether it's good or not.
---
With the addon it's "Click, click. Done for the level".
---
It actually doesn't, it makes the raid prioritize warr/mage/rogues for DPS instead of having a more diverse collection of classes.
---
Less flavour to raids.
---
depends if rogue poisons scaling with spell power is in right now.
---
 !RemindMe 70 days
---
https://www.warcrafttavern.com/addons/nugrunning-classic/
---
It's a journey but by using this addon you do not learn a single thing along the journey. At 60 you will arrive and do what you did up till now - find a "best spec"/10 guide, spec exactly like that and not worry about anything.
---
In the end you will not know why you are specced this way, why is it good and how you should be leveraging your talent build the optimal way.
---
This will basically automatically make you average at best, since people who do not understand their talents usually do not put much effort into performance.
---
They content is easy with or without them. If people want to spend more time to clear the content by chasing world buffs and farming consumables then let them.
---
No that's dps.
---
It’s pretty well known that hunters are really strong in pvp.
---
"Why not allow every player be optimal " Everyone can be viable, not everyone can be optimal. That is inherent in being optimal. Optimal is to be the best possible, which naturally puts you on a path to the best class, the best spec, and the best gear. Anything other than that is not Optimal.
---
If pserver statistics are anything to go by then no rogues wont be the most overpopulated class ever. Generally speaking on vanilla pservers the class spreads are actually pretty decently even with Warriors always being #1 followed by Rogues and Mages sitting around the same amount then slightly followed by Hunters. But none of them make up an absurd amount of the population. Youll probably notice a ton of Rogues early on(especially if you're Horde) but their numbers will dwindle as you get higher level as Rogues can be a bit of a pain in the ass too level.
---
Prebis is different as you don't need nearly as much hit. Assuming you roll Orc and use Arcanite Reaper you'll only require 6%. For Phase 1 use Truestrike Shoulders, Blackstone Ring, Battleborn Armbraces, Devilsaur set and you're good to go.
---
With Truestrike obviously being the most annoying to get you can simply use Mask of the Unforgiving until you get lucky and then replace the mask with Eye of Rend.
---
Yes, I see your point. But I'm talking about 30-50% increase in DPS. I'm not saying 25dps is alot if you have 500dps. But 50% dps increase at 500 dps is 750 dps, and that's a big deal.
---
hon, if you don't have the awareness to notice i've been drinking for 15 seconds now, i don't know how you are going to deal with being in a guild without fear ward.
---
Also, open your C:/ folder. Do you see a "Program Files (x86)" folder? (x86 is important)
---
If not, then **no** you need a 64-bit system
---
There’s gonna be a lot go rogues. Maybe even more than in Vanilla because people think that Vanilla rogues are super OP in pvp.
---
Sure,  and then we can start changfing the classes as well, and while er're at it the bosses, the weapons the armour, and before you know it we're back at bloody bfa again.
---
People don't seems to understand that a "small change" somewhere fucks up 15 other things.
---
not on classic LUL
---
Welcome to 2019.
---
The +6% hit is part of almost every mage build I thought
---
When warlocks complete their mount quest at 60, will they get the ridingskill to use their racial mounts?
---
Also, from what i've read, doing the epic mount quest as a warlock, you need to go DM, but that unlocks in phase 2, how am i going to get my epic rider then, do i have to get the racial skill/mount and then wait for phase 2 to unlock?
---
Several private servers have had AV with shredders, mines, guards, captains, etc. People still just ignore everything they can, kill whatever gives honor and then rush for the last boss. The BGs end in around 15-mins even with all the npcs.
---
.... there’s 4 Druid specs now?
---
They always had long range. This is even the nerfed version of their range.
---
wow this really strikes home with another hobby of mine. I'll remember the term elitist casuals :P
---
Hi Garrosh, long time no see!
---
He said track humanoids, a skill which druids have, is  beneficial for ganking as you can see opponents on the minimap.
---
He said nothing about track hidden.
---
Wow this is me.  Feels a little personal.
---
need that ad revenue
---
Suddenly the nochanges movement has died and were looking for ways to decrease the gap between top dps and hybrids. Hysterical.
---
You think you do, but you don’t.
---
Yes. Was confirmed on YouTube somewhere. I think it was during the interview with Omar.
---
Jeez, Northshire has a mailbox on retail now?
---
I  normally am ambivalent on most memes but this is terrific
---
There are actual problems with making paladins more viable tanks:
---
1. Paladin is Alliance only, which would give one faction two tanks and another faction just one (Warrior). Making Shaman a viable tank would take a lot more work and we run into balance issues at that point.
---
2.  It isn't actually as simple as buffing threat generation. You still have to address mana regen by way of adding prot-specific tier sets. Depending on how this is implemented it could just water down the drop pool. Okay, so maybe you let paladins trade their healing tier to an NPC for a Prot version. You still run into prot paladins competing with your holy paladins for drops. Additionally, if paladins get access to off-spec gear, why not other classes?
---
3. Paladins bring a lot of utility with them. If your tank's mana issues are dealt with, what impact does the addition of blessings, bubble, heals, etc have? Do Paladins become objectively superior to warriors? Do people stop taking warriors? Do Horde players switch to Alliance for Paladin tanks to min/max their raids and exacerbate population imbalances?
---
These are just a few issues off the top of my head.
---
I understand how No changes works. But, I also understand that there will be a few people arguing against this as it is rather controversial. But this is something I would argue for the better of the game. Obviously, some ppl will like to keep the game as simple as possible.
---
He specifically said while leveling lol
---
Shadow priest is one of the better solo levelers and yes you can heal dungs fine. Just be prepared to drink.
---
Ok been real for a second (I've never played vanilla) are world buffs in any sense needed to kill a boss during progression or is this just a speed running and parsing thing? Like I get every little helps but is it worth more then getting a few more pulls in on the boss?
---
Honestly if its just a parsing/speed running thing I can't see any issue.
---
Do I need to avoid damage from melee as ranged? 
---
Yes I'd like that
---
Going around and getting every single world buff to do a raid sounds like a huge time sink I'd rather spend just fighting something. As other people have pointed out, it could all just go down the toilet if you happen to die on the way to the raid or inside the raid to some random shit, and then it's like, why did I waste all that time for these dumbass buffs for nothing.
---
Why do a bunch of level 1 adventurers start out at a church anyway?
---
So i guess you are saying that without add-ons you would need a raid of higher skilled people
---
Lol thats more of a retail class thing, not classic.
---
Backpedals, keyboard turns in 2019. Big yikes
---
Feral DPS and tank got separated.
---
That looks just like the Abbey near my house :O
---
The mega minmaxer guilds will have trouble filling a ZG raid with “adequate” raiders.
---
Comparing dps is done in percentages, not absolute values. If everyone increases their dps by 50% that doesn't change anything regarding class balance.
---
Ever notice every sibgle one of those famoud play-what-you-want streamer always end up playing tier S class
---
It's fine to do micro-sips of water like in timed M+ runs in retail where you drink in any possible situation where you can spare a second or two...if water wasn't so damn fuckin' expensive.
---
You are dismissed Hero!
---

"Support Paladin"  
---
"Burst"
---
I'll take three words you will never hear in a sentence, Alex.
---
As a shadow priest, just try to mind blast snipe the last health of a mob to get the killing blow, and then you proc the spirit talent and regen like crazy, low downtime
---
Oh wow that’s interesting.  Guess it makes sense to be honest, it always seemed a little funky having a tank and dps both be speccing into the same tree.
---
Have you played Vanilla before? Ganking can be more of a rhythm and mindset; class has less of an impact than you’d think. It’s about being a predator. Choosing a proper Kill Target, assessing the danger, positioning, cooldowns/consumes, escape routes pre-planned, etc.
---
Stealth can be considered a Crutch. Proper Scumbags will gank you with any class; you won’t see them coming. 
---
You’ll realize this the more you gank and get ganked. And ENGINEERING. That’s your class; Engineer.
---
You basically pray for resist RNG. There's really not much counterplay in rogue vs rogue without LAP.
---
Healing as shadow can at times be beneficial in 5-mans, having a ranged silence can be a Godsend in the hands of a good priest.
---
No guild will allow you to run full arms, as you'd then need to mortal strike for high dmg, which will have a negative impact on the raid
---
Whatever it takes
---
Yes on classic. You can absolutely chain pull or pull multiple groups.
---
Everyone just sucked at the game back then and did everything slowly. Healers don't like it, but they don't need to be full mana for every pull.
---
This is epic. Thank you

You will DPS in exact values, you won't do % dmg to a boss. You will hit with numbers.
---
Therefore, if you (a rogue) have a DPS at let's say 500, and get a 30% increase in dmg. You'll end up with a 650 dps.
---
If you have a 400 DPS (as a feral druid), and get 30% increase in dmg. You'll end up with a 520 dps.
---
Both went up 30% in damage.
---
But Rogue did get 30 more DPS than the Feral. Why? Because the more DPS you have, the more % dmg will effect your outcome.
---
Hi, /u/Slymass

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c18ert/did_the_warlock_have_the_ability_to_summon_party/). 
---
That wasn't your argument.
---
What's turtle?
---
I'm amazed that ppl only start realizing this after 5 or 6 expansions and seasons, lol
---
People downvote everything everywhere. It becomes extremely clear at websites where the downvotes are shown or percentages are shown.
---
&gt;undead shadow priests
---
I mean it helps but won't let you reset, it's a 3min cd, somewhat situational disease, and they have another, bread and butter dot
---
Thanks for linking your doc. 
---
I only looked at the progression section and ignored professions and pvp. Overall, I like it and you touch on a number of details that are important: resistances, rep, attunements. 
---
My life constraints mean that I never raid and mythic+ is a fun opportunity for my playgroup and I. It’s not something that was around when you wrote this. Esports only general were not a consideration. How do they fit into your parallel progression? 
---
Balancing specs across expansions and gear has been a challenge. In your approach, how would this work while offering players something new? 
---
I’m still thinking about how to avoid all new content happening at level 60 (or higher). I like the idea of being able to go back to my toon at level 40 and running something that wasn’t possible before. Perhaps fixing the points of spec balance to every 15 levels would make it tractable. 
---
Imagine getting an expansion and there is new content at level 15 and 30 and you can revisit it with your character from level 30. Does it make sense?
---
Does blizzard ban both gold sellers and buyers or mostly buyers?
---
Please no moralising, I know. I'm just curious.
---
Note: ive sold gold for gamecards as a kid to sellers but thats it.
---
Enh / Ele shaman has the ability to do this as well.
---
But the difference between the druid and the rogue is the same with and without the 30%. Yes the flat amount increased,  but the % difference which is what matters stayed the same. If everyone is doing 1k dps instead of 500, then 100 dps means less than it used to.
---
What? It was exactly my argument?
---
This has been re-posted countless times, and I admit I don't even care... I will keep up-voting this meme every time I see it. It ALWAYS gets me, god damn!
---
It isn't required by the raids themselves, but it is required by high-end raiding guilds, and lower tiered guilds always end up mimicing what more successful guilds do, so then it becomes a requirement in most mid-tier guilds and even some lower tier guilds. 
---
It's also a personal thing where many end up feeling like they're not doing their part dps-wise by not being fully stacked on world buffs, as a fully stacked WB rogue will do about 50% MORE damage than an unbuffed one.
---
It kinda makes sense for making roles more clear cut, but I hate how it makes druids, who are THE hybrid class, less versatile.
---
Your argument is about gaps not total dps.
---
Well makes sense they can have such range, do you want the tower archers to have 30 yards range or what?
---
Thanks for sharing
---
My argument is to close the gaps between total dps. Is it not?
---
Blizzard has an actual backup of their 1.12 client, why would they use nostalrius data?
---
I don't think they get their racial skill, but it's very cheap none the less.
---
And yes you need diremaul, the quest isn't available before patch 1.4(or 1.5 i can't rememeber), which means you won't be able to get your class mount before phase 2.
---
&gt; But this is something I would argue for the better of the game.
---
Changes usually are made to benefit the game. Thing is, what's better for the game, which unintended consequences arise, and how you define "better" are all factors that need to be accounted for. Hence why WoW's had 15 years of changes to make the game better, but we're not at a better game.
---
Mate take a fucking math course before talking because you are so lost.
---
I was 16 when I first started playing WoW and my best friends were 15, we all rolled UD male rogues. Every day we would go to Duskwood and Redridge and gank lowbies. At the time we were around level 30 and I can't even recall knowing what the level cap was. I remember all of thinking we were so cool, one day a skull NE male rogue killed us, he had on Del'Rends, a white Ninja head (not sure what it was called) and Stormshroud shoulders, the dude looked so damn freaking cool, was so mesmerised... anyway he put us back in our place and we stopped ganking and concentrated on levelling so we could be as bad ass as that NE Rogue. It was awesome.
---
The more the better... wait....
---
Enlighten me please.
---
The warlock epic mount is technically a spell, AFAIK it doesn't come with the riding skill. Big deal for PvPers, because you can't use it during GCD. 
---
And no, you won't be able to get it until phase 2
---
Have you heard of private servers good sir?
---
willitclassic.com has a massive list of addons that have been ported to classic (the orange ones) and addons that will be updated for classic (blue ones) along with descriptions of each addon and where you can download them.
---
**EXCEPT that percentage wise, IT'S THE SAME**. How can you people fail so damn hard at basic math?
---
100 / 150 x 100 = 66.66%. The Warrior does 66.66% more damage compared to the Paladin.
---
130 / 195 x 100 = 66.66%. The Warrior does 66.66% more damage compared to the Paladin.
---
**IT IS THE SAME GAP, with or without buffs.**
---
Yeah I can see that, I always pictured them as hybrid because they could do all three roles but it always seemed funny to me that feral could be a dps spec.  Like why have balance and feral as dps specs and then have feral as tank as well (if you ask me balance was kind of a red headed step child in vanilla but that’s another topic).  Not that I don’t like ferals versatility in that sense, it just was always a little funny to me.
---
English is a language, where any comma is optional.
---
This looks awesome! Great work and a great site!
---
Subscriber counts in August aren't going to be very telling. Like every game, including WoW and every one of its expansions, there will be a significant drop-off in subscribers within a few weeks to months of launch.
---
Then we'll never see the end of "classic is dead" forum spam.
---
I'll have to pass.
---
The total value of the gap does not matter what matters is how the gap relates to total dps.
---
If you increase everyone's dps by the same amount, then yes the total value of the gap increases, but the value of the gap does not, so removing WB does not lower the gap between top and lower tier dps.
---
Not the only option of course but sure the most used one as in my opinion is the most fair. Loot council have mostlt the very serious guilds that min max everything.
---
Why are people still playing Spore in this day and age?! /s
---
My Dad threw away my Classic, Tbc and Wotlk boxes when i went for vacation to surprise me by renovating my room. Thanks dad. I never told him how much these boxes were worth to me to not make him sad or regret his surprise.
---
That'd better be a high elf and not a blood elf.
---
Well, first...isn't this #changes? World buffs were in Vanilla.
---
Secondly, if you think that removing world buffs will somehow lower the gap between a Mage and a Boomkin, or between a Rogue and a Feral Druid, or between a Fury Warrior and a Ret paladin ... you are clueless. The same gap will exists, regardless of World Buffs or not.
---
If a top tier dps class is doing X% more damage than a low tier dps class, the same X% will stay, with or without world buffs.
---
Do I, personally, consider that without World Buffs, raids will be harder? Yes. 
---
Do I, personally, consider that if Blizzard removes World Buffs from Classic, it will benefit the slow paced, old game style MMORPG? Yes.
---
HOWEVER, the moment you REMOVE a Vanilla feature, this means changes. And removing World Buffs IT'S A BIG FUCKING CHANGE. It opens up the possibility of additional changes, and I don't want that.
---
And, to our point : do I, personally, consider that the DPS gap between classes will be lower without World Buffs? NO, I don't...because I didn't failed math. I was quite good at, actually.
---
They won't but I've heard shadow oil and other consumable buffs will, until they fix it.
---
dude , i was born with infinity fear ward
---
Are the hitboxes of characters really bigger (tauren) and smaller (gnome)?
---
To be fair, most private server communities were pretty fucking shite compared to retail.
---
Blizz does maintain a number of classic games, and has started remastering some of them. Starcraft Remastered is available, and Warcraft 3 Reforged is a thing. Classic may also simply fall under that umbrella, old games they know they can still sell but may not necessarily be expecting some kind of renaissance.
---
Was this even in effect in BGs?
---
exactly!
---
It was pass retail until the next expansion announcement with ease, after that will depend on what the expansion offers, i guess.
---
Lesser dpsers aka cats and rets heal
---
I think this is [Abney Park Chapel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abney_Park_Chapel)
---
I think you could be troll druid aswell in the Alpha :p
---
Leveling was not my concern, but life at 60 outside of raid where you will farm for gold, rep, resources, pvp, etc
---
Because it makes the game look worse.
---
would like to live there)
---
Lighting in all of Classic is off. It really annoys me.
---
MC and BWL will be cleared by the most casual guilds, and normaly get even run by pugs.
---
So no commitment needed to run those, and most guild wont require to to be min maxed , consums farmed etc.
---
You can easly just pug mc and later bwl , zg/aq40 until you get what you want.
---
Female night elf called legolass
---
Indeed it does.
---
Removing world buffs in raids would be a good way to balance increasing the debuff slot limit (imo)...
---
Everyone will have their own opinion on this ofc, so most likely blizz will play it safe and change as little as possible.
---
&gt; But they used the Nost data... 
---
&gt; The only claim I have stated was that bears are better than cats at lv 20. Which is an objective fact. 
---
I'd love to hear your reasoning for how something that kills slower to the point of taking more damage despite having superior defences is "better", and that's of course also ignoring the loss of movement speed, because you sure as hell don't have the mana to swap to cat between pulls to move.
---
I have the USA collectors editor but I will play in Europe, and the USA key cant be ported to the EU account :-(
---
Not fair since EU game didnt even exists at that moment
---
It's literally only used for speedrunning/parsing on pservers. It was hardly ever used in vanilla.
---
Is 10 days played the average for 60? I’ve seen a lot of people talking about speed leveling at 4 days in the highest tier
---
God that was hard to watch
---
&gt; Have you often considered that the nost core information on how they guestimated the values for the game ( which blizzard also lost) was obtained by blizzard to help out with the release of classic? Because that's what happened
---
That's literally not what happened.
---
So, let's say.
---
Tier 1 rogue has 500 dps with no buffs.
---
Tier 1 feral has 400 dps with no buffs.
---
Rogue does 25% more DPS than feral. (gap 25%)
---
If you add 30% dmg to both classes you end up with 650 dps for rogues and 520 dps for feral.
---
Rogue still does 25% more DPS than feral (gap 25%) and you did a better math job.
---
My bad, reversed two numbers. So I didn't do this properly.
---
Has aimed shot with Shadowmeld been confirmed to work?
---
almost like not everyone has the same opinion
---
I guess going 20 minutes without those heirlooms is too much to ask.
---
Shit I love teldrassil.
---
It's still about gaps. The gaps will be the same, because there is only one proper way to compare gaps : USING PERCENTAGES.
---
If you are using raw numbers, and not percentages...you are doing it wrong.
---
And then you do math WRONG, you come to WRONG conclusions.
---
It's what Melderon did...and it's what you do.
---
You can absolutely clear most content without world buffs and it would still be relatively easy. I feel like world buffs are an unnecessary layer to vanilla raiding. Unfortunately, as a highly competitive individual player myself I'm a slave of the mindset "If you aren't doing it, someone else will and they will beat you". Even if I could force myself to not care about other guilds kill times, I would still be competing internally within my guild itself among the classes, which is also one of the things I enjoy about raiding. And if I show up to a raid without world buffs and someone else decides to get buffed, there won't be any competition no matter how hard I try.
---
But if you can enjoy the game regardless of knowing you aren't doing your 100% then more power to you. I envy the people that can.
---
Judt because you invoke slippery slope, doesnt mske it not a fallacy.
---
They can both, religiously.
---
Yep
---
Yes exactly
---
yeah that was a thing, exploited it myself
---
From what I understand you actually need less pummelers for tanking than you do for dps. DPS is about 1 per boss and tanking is 1 charge per boss.
---
It's really telling that the Arena Championships have less views than Classic WoW guides.
---
No I really don't care.
---
just so you know, you're supposed to use abilities and not only autoshoot.
---
Should I consider stat bonuses (like Gnome +5 int, or human weapon skills) when choosing a race for a class?
---
Not until you grind exalted with her.
---
 I choose undead rogue , it will be cool to stick daggers into the gnomes.
---
HEY GUYS CHECK OUT THIS SHIT
---
Creating water takes mana and time as well, might as well grind the extra mobs at that point.
---
Already knew that. I'll accept that as an apology.
---
Man Garfunkel really was a crazy guy, shame he died horribly when he was struck by lightning in the freak storm.
---
What like Esfand and Soda?
---
Nice repost
---
Do respecs cost the same no matter the level? For example does the first respec at level 20 cost 1g and the second 5g or are they discounted? Also how long for the cost to decay?
---
The man failed math, hard. I mean, he got to where 2+2=4, but he didn't get past.
---
Gaps, BY DEFINITION, are differences between 2 values. To compare GAPS, in DIFFERENT conditions, you have to use PERCENTAGES.
---
Melderon, and the OP fail to understand how to use math properly. 
---
Hopefully, by the end of this thread, he will get it.
---
Yeah, but then nobody will need you for their dungeon group.
---
nice
---
Not wrong at all, I'd say the hardest class to level hands down, but when you reach max you're a wrecking ball.
---
Not correct, they did this with overwatch and it was a huge success
---
Create them yourself and bring your friends.
---
Nochange was alwas a stupid meme and never realistic. No one makes a fuss about the improved graphics in the beta for instance. Or that spell batching us only a best guess implementation. Or that pets are behaving differently now. Or how wands interact with GCDs off of instant casts.
---
I found it to be so.  :)
---
yea pretty much this :D I just want to make sure everything I do is optimal
---
No, you have some proving to do.
---
It's a safe average if you're not wasting time but not really rushing.  
---
4 days : super nerd with 400+hours practicing on private server  
---
5 days : ignoring all professions/groups, just solo questing following a guide    
---
     
---
7 days : Doing dungeons, some easy professions, getting caught up in world pvp but generally playing efficiently  
---
10 days : Doing whatever they feel like but keeping true time wasting (afk in IF, bg'ing for a whole weekend, trying to get 300 enchanting) to a minimum - just log on and keep the exp bar turning over.
---
You don’t mail heirlooms any more either. You can instantly craft them from the heirloom tab.
---
As a paladin I'm a bit worried about not getting an epic mount until phase 2, but Blizz said phase 2 will be out fairly quick. Anyways probably not much to worry about, most people I assume wont have their epic mount before phase 2 anyways.
---
Wowhead has basic overviews on all the classes
---
https://classicwow.live/ for more varied/specialised info
---
For pvp and info on macros, addons etc for specific classes you probably want to just find content creators who are well known for playing that class on private servers
---
That is quite a substantial lineup.  Can’t imagine any other class / level can match it.
---
Pretty soon we'll all be turnin tricks in Old Town to get conjured crystal water
---
&gt;it includes learning what each talent does
---
Doesn't matter. Best talents are math weightings and interactions. For the majority of talents what is best can't be figured out without simulations and every good raider in retail is using simulation sites to figure out what gear they should value.
---
Ironically, it is in retail where knowing your talents and their situational utility is much more important than in vanilla.
---
are you referring the the beta server? because the other server type is packed.
---
jump in the r/classicwow discord on the sidebar
---
in each class channel there is pinned a link to the class discord
---
Tanks still do pretty good dps if they spec into feral affinity though, same thing for healers. Cat weaving resto druids are pretty much the standard for dungeon healing.
---
I really hope they touch up the lighting engine for the release...
---
I don't give a fuck, i've never seen this before and i lost it hahaha
---
Dude that's brilliant!!! Thank you so much
---
Any original owner will know this :D
---
It must be very very few who shill out for an original CE cdkey now.
---
&gt; Well, first...isn't this \#changes?
---
WoW:C was always about what changes are acceptible.
---
Well "speed leveling" is outside the average... but the normal person's average /played to 60 was 10 days.
---
And Warlocks are only used for porting people to the raid, right? Fuck that noise.
---
Try a film of gelatin. It's even edible.
---
Yes. It was changed like 6 months before 1.12.
---
I've got a group of bros and we've all decided. A warrior, paladin, hunter, priest and I'm Gunn run dwarf rogue. Rolling alliance this time round.
---
I’d say more sellers than buyers, it’s likely the accounts used to offload gold are regularly banned. However many buyers find themselves on the pointy end of the ban stick also.
---
What is your point?
---
thats not 100% accurate.
---
if we realy want to min/max a feral is superior to prot warries in single target tanking in the first few weeks/raids till prot warris get there gear. (first 1-5 mc ID s) 
---
why? because there tank stats are not as affected as warries (worse scaling but higher start values). and with the gnomeregan 2h mace "exploit" there threat is superior to warries by a long shot.
---
everything else is a great sumup
---
Just because you describe his comment fallacious, doesn’t mean he’s wrong.
---
Your response is known as an argument from fallacy, where you say “that contains a fallacy so just be incorrect”.
---
Fallacies often operate when there is a lack of knowledge, in this case of the slippery-slope we have existing precedent - this company has already taken the slippery slope.
---
Ergo, vis-à-vis, concordantly he’s perfect right to be concerned.
---
just keep pressing multi shot and you will be fine
---
As the paladin worked with mana regeneration on spell crits, and had no way to make use of spirit, I always assumed paladins would benefit much more drastically from intellect, as to why it was bloated full on ever gear piece made for them.
---
Sounds awesome, none of my friends want to play anymore.
---
I'm guessing it is \[Abney Park in Stoke Newington, London\]([https://images.app.goo.gl/8Qt199955gChSEJM8](https://images.app.goo.gl/8Qt199955gChSEJM8))
---
&gt;  is ignoring everything that isn’t in the combat to his justification
---
Please do tell what I'm ignoring, because from what I can tell
---
Cat have:
---
* More damage
---
* Less downtime
---
* More movespeed
---
I'm not sure what other factors I could possibly be ignoring.
---
Rogue vs Rogue is decided by whoever gets the opener. Pretty much always been this way.
---
I'm still very undecided between the two. 
---
Will probably decide depending on what my friends want me to roll.
---
Playing a tank? Let your healer drank
---
So your saying the old mode gave us more options? :)
---
For me it would not be classic without Iron Forge.
---
Ahh man that's a shame, good thing about classic is you'll have plenty of people to sesh with anyway Haha
---
The thing that is most tempting me to play Paladin is the fashion. Dayum.
---
Sounds pretty *bfa* to me
---
Total gamechanger
---
Yes it costs the same.
---
I think the decay is like a month, it's definitely really long.
---
Can't decide between Mage and Priest, nor between Undead or Troll, because one keep saying the Troll Berserking racial is a must for raiding, the others say it's not that important because you're near full health most of the time anyway and can't squeeze in an additional frostbolt.
---
Depends on what I'm going to do mainly: Priests might be more sought-after in 5-mans, DPS classes for raids due to their sheer size. Damn it!
---
Allahu akbar
---
Dwarf rogues are awesome
---
Depends, honestly the +5% int is really small, but for a warrior the human weapon skill is massive.
---
Oof.
---
blame the dps for not CCing correctly
---
Why do you reply the same answer everywhere? I got it, I did the math poorly, I admitted it and edited my whole post. You don't have to be a jerk about it.
---
What a delightful prank. I bet his cheeks were red after that.
---
He's probably relying on frost nova shatters only. 
---
15% chance to freeze from frostbite isn't very high when mobs die in just a few frostbolts anyway.
---
All about that stone form and find treasure ;)
---
Its #1
---
Hey huntards, can you stop with the spirit bond ? This talent is the single worst talent in the entire game.
---
I won't go on a rant to explain how bad it is, but these 2 talent points are a total waste and would be way more beneficial in ANY other talent.
---
Also, cool addon bro.
---
Tauren is bigger, gnome is the same (melee radius). Gnome has a smaller height but it makes no difference for attacks.
---
Well, a small change, due to implementation of an old game on new infrastructure, or even a big one that will be removed it's one thing.
---
To remove world buffs is a BIG FUCKING CHANGE. And I would say that while it might be a positive change...there is just no way to accept it, because it is too big of a change.
---
Oh, so your problem is that you're unable to tell the difference between assholes being a negative and assholes using min maxing to assholes.
---
Here's a thought, have you considered that no matter what those people would be assholes and they'd just be it in some other way?
---
When was it last posted?
---
This is why I’ll be tanking; it can be reeeaallly frustrating when your tank doesn’t know what they’re doing. 
---
“Skull -&gt; X, Sap Nipple, Sheep Moon, wait 2 sec for aggro plz. Careful of poison puddles. Healer ready? .....Ok, pulling after sap.” 
---
Man, I cant wait to do that again. Fun times.
---
“Healer ready?” I asked this before any pull where I’d have to Mark targets. It’s the most important question a Tank can ask, IMO.
---
In general the stats are ok but pretty weak, resistance buffs are useless, weapon skills is good sometimes for PvE depending on your spec, and actives are often good for PvP. Also watch out for priests who all get race specific abilities.
---
You’re not paying for this game for someone else to tell you what to play or how to have fun with it.
---
Vanilla wow is the best game ever created and even if it's capped and you lose progress it's still better than anything else.
---
Legend says that God himself came down to Earth to help design WoW. He unfortunately had to go home in 2006.
---
I don't think so, in our guild of 30+ there's only half a dozen of us who want to play classic again.
---
Nope.  Bet i was super pumped, though...
---
theres a great caster dagger from SM Lib endboss
---
And his ass chapped!
---
1, 5, 10, 15, ... 50 (cap). Level makes no difference. Decay is 5g a month down to a minimum of 10g.
---
Why is playing moonkin and ret paladin more fun than playing a good spec?
---
Lol friends? Looks like we got a cool guy over here!
---
Thanks for the comments guys, looks like the range is fine.
---
The paladin does 66.7% of the Warrior's damage, and the warrior does 50% more damage compared to the paladin
---
On /r/classicwow feels and janky memories are treated as the highest form of evidence.
---
Just look at the hundreds of thread that "felt" the damage was too low in dungeons, they didnt even budge when videos from that era and blizzards reference client showed that the damage was correct.
---
One person even told me blizzard was lying about the reference client so that they got less work to do, just hope blizzard keeps going for ACUAL no changes and not peoples distorted memories.
---
This is a great idea. Being able to save a pvp and pve build and being able to fly between them without fault.
---
The macros for fart wave and rude lmao
---
Where in this response did you address “why not have be slowest leveling person set the pace?”
---
Doing so is quite literally the solution to your dilemma you’ve presented here...
---
Here is a very basic idea for you: companies make more than one product to appeal to more than one market.
---
The same people who make Axe make Dove. But you would have to be a moron to think that means that if they make any change to Dove they will turn it into Axe.
---
Blizzard are making Classic specifically to make money off the people who do *not* like BFA. They already have the money from people who do like BFA. They want the money from the people who like Classic enough to pay for it but do not like BFA enough to pay for it.
---
To entertain even for a second the idea that minor improvements to Classic will make it turn into BFA is deeply stupid. The whole commercial purpose of Classic is to not be BFA. But that doesn't mean it has to suck in easily fixed ways just because some paranoid idiots think any change equals BFA.
---
The neckbeards who advertise no changes never set a foot in Naxx.
---
Yeah but screw shaman tanks.
---
Hypnotic Blade from SM Library is all I can think of.
---
That ain't going to be my healer.
---
My healer will be the happiest healer on my realm.
---
This meme sucks, you don't even know how it's used properly
---
You have to use a website talent tree picker to import the data into the add-on .. the add-on doesn't have this data natively .. I get what you are trying to say but you obviously didn't read the original post before crying about "noobs need to learn", who really cares how people pick their talents .. the onus is on individuals making that decision on how to play the game
---
Conjure water rank 3 is clearly the most important of all those.
---
What else would you consider?
---
Then they blame you for the wipe because you weren't wanding. Happened to me.
---
You're doing it wrong.
---
I announce my tactic at the beginning of the run. What marks are and what I will tank (I usually do not tank the Skull). As for healer, also at the start, I say that I will pull when I consider that he have enough mana. There are pulls that require 20% mana, and pulls that require 70% mana.
---
I also say that if the healer needs mana break, he should say it.
---
There is NO WAY for me to repeat every single marked pull what I do and ask the healer if he's ready. Before boss pulls, yeah, maybe. But every marked pull?
---
No, it has nothing to do with the fact that people want to improve the game. People only jealous of this guy.
---
Yes, otherwise AV would be absolutely glorious for farming huge quantities of honor for basically 0 investment.
---
Horde is winning by far in pvp imo. The faction wars seem to usually end with a horde victory. I think alliance has more PvE feats under their belt at this point in time however.
---
Wait a minute.
---
&gt; Ok been real for a second (I've never played vanilla) are world buffs in any sense needed to kill a boss during progression or is this just a speed running and parsing thing?
---
WoW is a game of inches. There's no one thing you *need* to do, a lot of the time, but there are lots of things you *could* do and if you do too few of those things you wipe.
---
So while you don't *need* world buffs to beat Loatheb in the universal sense, for a lot of guilds at some specific point in time given their gear and skill it will be true that they can beat Loatheb with world buffs and cannot beat them without them.
---
Harder for you.
---
I was a Warrior tank in Vanilla, I will be a Warrior tank in Classic.
---
Me not Carlos.
---
No one gives a shit
---
It doesn't even feel massively multiplayer because of sharding. Just feels like a looter-shooter dungeon crawler.
---
OP weapons in retail now? Like... you know that weapons in vanilla were much more OP and had bigger contribute to performance of a class, right?
---
No changes!!
---
You won't find a more comprehensive overview of the shaman class. They get into the science of that shit. If you're planning on playing shaman, watch their shaman guides 100% will thank me later.
---
Almost seems like the intent of the beta is to test aspects of the game that the developer determines needs testing.  🤔
---
Obviously bad design choices are bad in hindsight? 
---
Who knew?!?
---
You have better graphics in 2019?
---
All my post was obviously taking into account that gold is only introduced through looting of items that are sold to NPCs, gold drops and quest rewards.
---
If they just would have CCed perfectly it would not have been a problem. Horrible dps.
---
12 year olds have no idea about the og emojis
---
Picking undead is the easy part. Now I just have to decide on class lol
---
I know MC will be pretty doable by pugs but I'm skeptical about BWL and later mainly because I never experienced it though. You really think that will be the case?
---
How?
---
Raids are still easy. When will you people understand that.
---
playing with friends is awesome until they all decide that apex legends is their new favorite game and you're stuck on a bad server.
---
Probably quite a few. Some people use guides for games. It's been a thing since the advent of gaming. I wouldn't let it bother you.
---
Same subscription for both. But yeah, if they separated them that's definitely possible. 
---
But just as I've pointed out in previous threads like this. Just because classic might be more popular than BfA/future expansions doesn't mean modern WoW is dead. It still has a lot of players, and many of the classic players also play modern WoW, they are not mutually exclusive.
---
that is not how taunt and threat works.
---
you pull aggro if you have 120/130% threat of the current target. 
---
a taunt puts the tank on equal threat then the current target AND forces the enemy for the duration of the taunt to attack you.
---
now you have 100% threat and a time window to actually pull the mobs aggro (get over 120%)
---
if you fail to produce that amount of thread you will lose the mob again after taunt debuff runs out.
---
so if you lose aggro you are already 20% behind and also need another 20% to get it back. 
---
taunt negates the first 20% and gives you a save time window to establish another 20%
---
every other ability thats not a taunt only gives you a fixed value of threat
---
without taunt you need 40% while the mob smacks your dps. and no tank can produce that much threat in the 1-2sec the boss needs to turn around and oneshot your dps. granted, if the dps is dead you are probably nr1 in threat again but thats not how you want to play
---
&gt; In vanilla, quest rewards are often completely useless for your class or not even gear at all. This means that when you do get something it means so much more and it's almost bound to be an upgrade.
---
I'd also say it depends on the reward too. Some were truly amazing and useful like the Carrot on a Stick, but others had even sentimental value, like Linkin's Boomerang, that were never really super useful, but you kept stashed in the bank regardless since it was a badge of honor.
---
But original Vanilla was with or without glow?
---
not to mention spec. no more free spec changes

Follow up question - how do I beat a gnome rogue as a night elf rogue if he has dropped my HP pool to 0?
---
Please note, this is assuming I have no gear.
---
I'm with UNATCO, start talking.
---
To staff of warlock none compare
---
Leaves its enemies seeing double
---
To defy its power none would dare
---
Don't report anything, I might get in trouble
---
The idea that raid buffs are an exploit is pretty much bullshit. I get that he doesn't like them, but "exploit" doesn't mean "anything I don't like".
---
No thanks.  I don’t have these same fond memories of old AV that the few vocal minority shouting about it seem to have.  I’ll take the 1.12 version and be fine with that.  Thanks.
---
I never really understood why Blizzard decided against presenting the PvE part as Esports as well. 
---
I'm sure official Blizzard coverage of world first races (although not live most likely since guilds decide that on their own) would attract more viewers than Arena.
---
Elvui, questie, kth threat meter, gatherer
---
First rule:
---
Content must relate to World of Warcraft: Classic. This is not a community for private servers, current World of Warcraft, streamer drama, etc.
---
Yeah, but who got world first Hogger?
---
&gt; I get what you are trying to say but you obviously didn't read the original post before crying about "noobs need to learn"
---
You obviously do not have the capacity to think on your own. Of course I read the post. I also read OP's "this is Joana's build", which is exactly what I am talking about. Maybe you should try to read before you hate.
---
So time travel DOES exist.
---
Or just have a build picked out and now you can load it like this and not have to open a link in the browser every time.
---
It's kind of a gray zone because not even world first guilds used world buffs like they do on private servers. It's just a huge crutch that trivializes content.
---
This has never been true on private servers tbh.
---
This is WoW not OW.  There is post OW beta proof (BfA) to support my claim.
---
You’re a good man, thank you.
---
I have literally every key + every modifier (shift, alt, crtl) and several multi-modifier combos. Plus 13 buttons on my mouse + the same mods. I'd need to make stuff like physical F25+ buttons to get more keybinds.  And I refuse to click these extra bars so that would be useless.  No.  Sorry....not talking about bars.  If I made that communication error sorry.  Not the best conveyer of ideas.  Let me try again....
---
I have every key I can bound.  If you've got a way to be as efficient with a human and an auto-ranker....that's like saying a human speedrunner can play with the precision of a TAS device.  It can't.  We can't I mean.  And I find that....disappointing.  If they won't see use why are they in my book?
---
A &amp; D rebound to strafing was one of the best things I've done to improve my play. If anyone reading this is on the fence about doing it- do it!
---
i love it, love gnomes
---
What?
---
yeah but who wants to farm consumables for a shitty 5man dungeon. thats a level of basement neckbeard nerd autism i dont even want to know.
---
respekt if you do though please be my tank
---
It’s a shared subscription, so no real way to tell based on that metric alone.  Looking at the concurrent players online in each version of the game would be the better determining stat.
---
I think Classic will be immensely higher when it launches, and will slowly fall to numbers that are closer to retail numbers over time.
---
Why are you in such a rush tho
---
Still think they should have made a cow rogue originally. 
---
I think I just like cows. 
---
I am also from the South
---
I'm not following how it's different from the current reality, finding a spec online and following it to a T?
---
And the answer we've arrived on is that server infrastructure, graphic (but not model &amp; texture) and UI changes are acceptable, but gameplay and balance changes are not. This is firmly in the second category of change, and it's bad.
---
What a poorly chosen title, this was a great video but its dead on arrival to the masses that won't watch it.
---
I thought it was fascinating that a Death and Taxes raider said they weren't utilizing it at least up to AQ40 when they were present.
---
I don't like the "exploit word" but after the full video I get what they're trying to pull together. Personally, I agree with their recommendation of world buffs falling off when you go inside a raid.
---
Are shaman decent dungeon healers at max level?
---
Aesthetics
---
Mainly for PvE really.
---
Hopefully I dont get downvoted here, but I've never understood why people use addons at all?
---
Raid addons trivialise the content to an extent (e.g. Decurvise), economic addons mean that anyone can play the AH better and you dont need to learn the 'proper' value of things as much as if you weren't using them, and addons like the above, whilst cool, represent QoL improvements that remind me far more of retail than of classic.
---
Now I'm sure people will take exception to this comment and down vote, but the point remains that most (not all, but most) addons either trivialise content, or represent QoL improvements that are, to me, the opposite of what Classic WoW should be about.
---
If people want to install Questie and Auctioneer, and addons for each raid boss then thats cool, I hope they have fun - I have just never understood the appeal, and I think Vanilla is best played addon free (aside from that UI ofc...)
---
But you never look at your character.
---
General reposti
---
Just keep everything white that looks like profession material, especially raw meat. Dont know why but no one thinks about meat. Everything green and above that isnt soulbound obviously too.
---
Used to sell meat on ah, bought all and raised prices as hell. Thanks to non existant concurrence did i always get rich that way. Atleast in vanilla where pet food was important.
---
&gt; How long would it take to get into if you didn't have a background in programming?
---
Depends, but this is a really good way to start getting a background in programming.
---
Except when you're in those few levels right before new water and the only water available to you give so little mana.
---
I don't know if I'd agree. Having a poor spec while leveling could really ruin one's enjoyment of the class. If anything, I'd start with a good baseline spec and then experiment once you understand how it works.
---
I've got a good idea, they should balance the entire game around this "arena" thing.
---
since its one subscriptions for both the question is phrased wrong.
---
but you could ask how many none bfa accounts have an active subscription. and even then you dont know how many play both or have bought it and dont play anymore
---
but blizzard could give a count on aktive players, which they wont
---
Cdew isna good shammy streamer
---
Warlock or Druid...
---
I'd argue retail is dying because it is no longer massive, it's barely multiplayer unless you're in a guild, and it's only online because you need an internet connection. 
---
I tried, I honest to god tried, to play BfA and it was a slog because I could solo 3 mobs by myself, never even died, it was just "a matter of time" instead of a matter of effort and reward, and then I hit 120 and then it seemed like there was just "a whole lot of nothing" to do. There is plenty to do but it's all pretty inconsequential and has little substance.
---
Yes, equally good as priests
---
I didnt even know what bongos was till you explained it. I also think you are overestimating how many people use it. Most people use Elvui
---
I give credit to this guys parents.  Had his dad not injected a shot of his baby batter into this guy’s mother’s tuna oven, then Classic WoW would have never happened.  Bravo Mr and Mrs.
---
It's possible in lower level dungeons, but after say Uldaman, you have to be more careful with pulls. The game becomes progressively harder, to keep up with the fact that your skill as a player is growing.
---
When I say harder and skill, I mean less room for yolo shit, more methodical and planned out encounters.
---
Classic beta has presented a slightly skewed image of the difficulty because they are essentially running the dungeons with maxed out gear and being advanced players to top tier players.
---
The average Joe party with shitty leveling gear will probably find the dungeons stimulating enough.
---
Just.....deal with being a bit out of sync.  You're either forcing someone to not play or they don't get XP but can still run with you.  A level or two will never break a dungeon challenge.  That'll be less stressful overall.
---
This isn't true, I had many one v one duels with exceptionally good players, i'd say opener would give you 80% chance of winning
---
Efficiency
---
:(
---
Yes but disc holy is better for wpvp and more versatile.
---
But ganking lowbies is the essence of vanilla /s
---
Back in classic i played an dwarf rogue simply because i visited an friend at home that got the game first and i watched him questing in the dwarf/ironforge area with his NE Hunter. The area and snow mountains sold it for me back then.
---
After reaching lvl 60 and learning the competition of the many rogues for Dungeons etc. i wanted to go back to the leveling experience and started an human warlock and loved the class ever since.
---
My rogue never reached lvl 70 in tbc and i got into playing warrior and loved to play this class casual for dungeons and pvp.
---
In wotlk i switched to horde cause of active friends back then and i stayed on horde ever since (warlock/warrior/mage since legion).
---
For classic i cant decide between horde and alliance but for the classes ist warrior first and maybe warlock second if i got the time. I assume i will just have 1 or 2 friends  that will play casual besides Job and family, one of them is sold for the horde. I want to play casual pve/pvp without a regulär raiding shedule.
---
I love the human visuals and animations for both classes but on the horde side i am tired of the orc style/animations even if it is the warrior masterrace. The warlock would be undead for sure, but what gender?
---
So is it alliance or horde? 
---
I am leaning towards human warrior but what if the friend will get back into classic? And what absolut human warlock for pvp?
---
For Horde which race should i play for warrior?
---
Orc vs tauren warrior?
---
So many questions for the next 70 days ;D
---
difference is that people are good now, ragnaros will die within the first week of launch.
---
they are really good.
---
That last sentence. Guess ill try shaman. I've always played Blood DK which obviously doesn't exist in classic. Enh is the next best thing.
---
Oh yeah, you'll find groups no problem. Chain heal is awesome.
---
Yes, those who want to progress with their guild (or be secured a spot for future loot, pve gear is important for pvp and hunters are not taken to raids a lot).
---
Hunter damage simply drops off long term, the weakest geared hunter is nightfall hunter usually.
---
Regardless of what he meant he was mistaken. When levelling, its useful to blink away from a frozen mobs to get distance prior to resuming dps, both single target and AoE. Its useful to Its useful when travelling long distances pre mount. Its wasteful when moving between mobs. Its useful to escape in PvP to get range to sheep/whatever. I guess the long and the short of it is: Overall, its useful. :D
---
I mean it's not just "proving fans wrong" it's squashing criticism. 
---
And like you said they if already had the vanilla code easy they aren't wasting that much time and effort?
---
Those are the worst
---
No one except for world first guilds will turn you away based on your race. Pick which you like best
---
What? Most of us play in 3rd person and see our character literally the whole time from the loading screen until we exit the game. Do you play in 1st person?
---
Also if you think people don't care about that stuff you'd be surprised how much time people are going to spend on grinding for things like cooler looking mounts that don't give any gameplay advantage.
---
drinks entire water and still at 60% mana cri
---
I had many one v one duels rogue v rogue I was pretty decent and I vs players that were better than me, opener does NOT guarantee the win, definitely difficult to win but it's by no means impossible, tbh I enjoyed the rogue duels more when I got sapped first
---
Pretty much all the rank 1s and tournament pvpers rolled horde so it's not really a good representation. It will be different on different servers.
---
Probably not, but what you want is completely irrelevant and unimportant.  So it’s honestly a moot point.
---
Is it release at 11pm for UK ?
---
HAAAAAAA HUUUUUUUUUUUU
---
level 18?
---
AAAAHHHHH
---
Because no mater how close things are, unless they are exactly the same, people will have subjective preference.  Look at retail balance "debates".
---
At this point I don't think you even understand what DPS is.
---
No, it's not
---
Need mana. 
---
mana after this pull
---
OOM STOP PULLING 
---
Good times.
---
Absolutely. Windfury is such an instrumental tool in vanilla, every melee-heavy group is going to want a resto shaman healer for increased threat gen / dps.
---
Been a couple of weeks since this meme was last posted.
---
First month for sure. Then not at all unless it shakes a new wave of youngster subscribers (that for some reason like to suffer).
---
Simply put, people don't have the time to enjoy classic properly and there's a reason the game is more immediate now.
---
No, certain classes like warriors scale extremely well with stats like crit because of their talents, so if you add +crit to your raid through world buffs mages, warlocks and warriors are going to scale better then other classes. What good does +10% crit do to a shadowpriest lol
---
Well sure if you are blind you don't look at your character. In every other case you do.
---
It’s the final payback for World War II.
---
I feel like your childishly saying #nochanges.
---
99.99% of the player base wasn't world buff stacking in Vanilla. There's even audio clips of the best guilds in the world not doing it.
---
A #nochanges on something like that is against the spirit of the movement. It brings so many toxicity risks that its just not worth it. I don't even understand what the benefits are to be honest. Feeling more powerful? Seems hardly worth it. Ya let's log off our main to preserve buffs, deep gameplay.
---
Abney Park is used to depict Highgate Cemetery in Waking The Dead season 2 "Thin Air" episodes.
---
Ok it better serves for shooting Warcraft's next movie. 
---
lol.
---
Without a resist, I can confirm there is no way out of this stun chain for you. Even if you get the opener on him, with stoneform, he will be able to break this sequence
---
You’re not the messiah. You’re a very naughty boy.
---
Much like the got petition, an AV petition just wouldn't do anything.
---
Then play retail.
---
[https://youtu.be/oWNt\_8xcOZw?t=492](https://youtu.be/oWNt_8xcOZw?t=492)   watch in 0.25. after the fear&gt;will, he is meleeing from so far away - and there is a high probability that this isn't even max range as this just happened to be where he is at after the fear (high probability, it could be on the very max range yes but I doubt it)
---
it's blizzlike and there is a reason it was implemented
---
Yeah, after the debacle of the legendary rogue daggers in arenas during cats and the deathwing sword blizzard made sure to keep weapons as stat sticks.
---
Except for layering
---
It was a LOT on mine but it’s going to be different in every server cause they will have different economies.
---
I wonder what classes would be considered best DPS if the game was balanced solely around PvP. Probably rogues?
---
I don't understand, they are already doing that by closing access to beta servers and only letting beta players play AV this weekend.
---
They don't need more players, they know their servers can handle a big load.
---
Reminds me of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjMiDZIY1bM) absolute fantastic video.
---
I dont know what private server youve been on but I have never seen this strafing bug on private servers
---
www.avoidstreamers.com
---
TBC did, actually, fundamentally change the game.
---
True, I mean what will he ever do with those extra 20 seconds he saves by rushing and chainpulling?
---
This is why I advocate "play for yourself" in 2019 :)
---
Too much competition that if you are someone that will play wow for hundreds of hours over months - don't let others choose a server,faction,class for you.
---
They will get bored, pulled away or stop playing. 100% guaranteed :)
---
Reminds me of this:

I have a background in shipping would that help?
---
I'll be honest, I probably wouldn't enjoy healing your group. A tank who thinks everyone is an idiot and is a control freak about everything is one of the most frustrating things in a pug.
---
6 hours is short.
---
Well, it seems to require so little effort that it just doesn't happen in retail anymore.
---
Game design influences player behavior as well as the style of player that sticks around, full stop.
---
I was waiting for the REEEEEEEEEEE. I was disappointed.
---
I've set myself for what race/class I'll play. Now the difficult part is choosing which race/class gets to be my first alt.
---
\&gt; Could be useful for people who want to find more about the class they  plan to roll or maybe dodge them when they release the realm names.   
---
well the page you linked has not classes mentioned and half of the streamers are missing, but thanks dude
---
10 ping tryhards in the house!
---
First toon was a paladin.  It sucked.  But I enjoyed the role I played in my raid.  I didn't want to play a tank.  And yet if I was a viable tank i would have been expected to tank.  That's not why I rolled a paladin.  Just my opinion.
---
No, it's completely possible to chain pull level 60 instances. The vast majorities of players just completely sucked.
---
I'l just drink through half a fight if they start when I'm not ready.
---
A lot will start - then most will reroll to Hunter after they realized sleath makes them move slower (who woulda thought?!?!)
---
Ofc not everything has to be. But it's not something that can officially be decided imho.
---
If competition in a game reaches a certain level it automatically becomes an Esport.
---
I asked him why he do this... he answered he don't want to be the slow tank guy. All mages and the heal are oom trying to kill the mobs with the wards...
---
Your site has method players and hydra on NA for God knows what reason.
---
I agree, there are going to be many players who don't browse this sub at all. We will never know what they are going to play lol
---
Then the mage will start pulling mobs to speed things up.
---
Any Priest standing near steep ledge or lava.
---
I don’t get why people want to live the experience of Classic while wanting to alter it at the same time.
---
You want vanilla back? Have it as it was. It had its quirks and flaws but that’s how it was .It you update it you’ll get a new experience and it’s not vanilla anymore.
---
It should be this simple.
---
Did it get reported?
---
not my site, but goot point
---
I bet that some people will limit their internet speed just to feel those warps in pvp haha
---
This is part of the experience - going in and having more knowledge allows you to generate more gold - you'll learn soon enough, plus the fresh launch will be different from 3 months in :)
---
I'm doing the exact opposite, I was a rogue throughout all of Vanilla and on but this time around I'm rolling pally.
---
Indeed!
---
Closed Beta finished up at 60.
---
No but it's the same company dingus, same practices. When a successful business model is presented it would be stupid for them to not take advantage of it. OW drought a month before release really got people itching
---
They are playable.  The role goes with the class.  The difficulty of the raid is based on comp NOT the mechanics of the raid.  You are looking at the "fix" backwards.
---
Respeccing costs gold.
---
Great clip ruined by his over excitement and blowing my ears out.
---
This is so cool! I'll have to use it when I'm tanking
---
If you're looking to optimize this much, just go dw.
---
I think you posted this in the wrong sub
---
Nah, if someone needs a break they should announce it, especially healers. I just quickly peek at their mana before pulling.
---
Legomyegolas
---
I first decided to play gnome mage. I dont know how, but I have now ended on Night elf rogue. Yep, you read correct.
---
It was all known.. and there will be people without bis now due to time limits and not being in a hard-core guild. The hard-core guilds always theory crafted and knew.
---
Still 25%less dps, useless.
---
Do you have hard data that shows Activision-blizzards World of Warcraft monthly or annual revenue, and how it shows that microtransactions support half?
---
Warrior with a pocket healer, way more deadly than any other class+pocket healer combo.
---
Easier by patch is fine, I was discussing player skill and knowledge though.
---
For one month, yeah.
---
It looks like the back cushion is meant to sit on top of the bottom cushion.
---
Just make sure everyone knows, those are alts for those that plan on playing a lot.
---
With that in mind - just set the goal to the slowest person, if they are level 15 tell everyone to not go past 16.
---
So what? Whats your point?  
---
The fact that there's so many people on this sub reddit asking for changes, really makes me think that this "you think you do, but you don't"-guy was right. If you don't like Vanilla for how it was, then maybe you should consider playing something else.
---
Sounds like a dead mage to me.
---
Minipets are one of the most volatile markets. Low supply, and also fairly low demand, usually only sought out by collector types as one-offs (in a game that doesn't exactly encourage that playstyle). Could sell for anywhere from 5gp to 150gp depending on your server (might be waiting a while for the latter though). When I played a pserver for a while last year, it was around 30gp.
---
Jokes aside from my experience people really love having an actual good hunter in their raids/dungeons. Maybe the bar is set low for expectations.
---
Yo look at this fuckin guy ballin it out with full judgment and sulfuras.
---
&gt; Vanilla is the only **expansion**
---
Sorry, that made me laugh. You should know what you did.
---
Looking at your character is the worst thing you can use your focus on in this game, it provides you with no information in a game where people struggle to take in all the necessary information.
---
cross realm bg is the best thing ever for PvP, who the fuq wants to wait in que for 2 hours and have 30 min fun.
---
You must be someone that enjoy watching paint go dry..........
---
For most players, not even with a good AI
---
What about new content? How do you feel about Jagex etc producing new stuff for old school runescape? Do you think that could be an option, whilst still remaining true (certainly for a time) to its pedigree.
---
All I know is Shield Slam does too much damage and needs to be nerfed! Tanks be damned!
---
&gt;Is everyone dying so much to get the “vanilla” experience that Blizzard isn’t aloud to make other classes/specs viable? I don’t understand this train of thought and it seems ignorant tbh
---
Unfortunately  - yup :)
---
Class changes / balance makes the game more like BFA where every spec does the same damage/heals/tanking.
---
1 of many reasons why BFA is dead on a weekend on "high" populated servers.
---
No changes isn't a meme to just say - it's a literal request so that warriors are unstoppable with healers and warlocks get to gear you for 10 years.
---
Yeah they are. But what he means is that they can internally see where the subbed people are playing (retail or classic) they won’t show it but instead say “wow has x amount of subs” making it look like retail is doing great so they can sell more expansions.
---
Blizzard: "Here's layering"
---
Jon Snow: "UH DON WUNT IT"
---
Ion Hazzikostas: "You know nothing, Jon Snow"
---
Thank you for the reply - but how much is a lot in terms of gold?
---
Orc anything... Stupid stun resist.
---
#Track Hidden works equally for both and still isn't that great. Track Humanoids doesn't help with stealthed units at all.
---
As a dwarf rogue I avoid orc anything
---
havent seen soda for a long time, went looking up some of his classic videos.
---
Jesus the guy is either naive or completely ignorant of classic meta. He will be in a rude awakening if he thinks he could still do decent dmg as resto druid or be fine at other specs just by swapping.
---
As a rule of thumb you can do all 5mans as any spec.
---
Oh I see. Does it actually list population count of the servers, or just how many there were of each?
---
To me Wpvp is the largest driving force behind an mmo feeling like an active vibrant world.
---
&gt;  Do you play in 1st person?
---
No, I just look at things that provide useful information, my health, enemy health, surroundings, cooldowns, quest log, map.
---
Like, it depends. If, like me, you're going to play on a PVE server than rogues should me much less. The core play pattern of the class is to make the others waste their life just like you do. 
---
When that's not possible, the appeal of the class drop significantly.
---
Interesting. I thought with a 0.1% chance to drop such a pet would be much more expensive than 150g late game. But thank you for the detailed insights!
---
no offense to you and I appreciate the effort you've made in your post, but many of us spent 12 years since its departure to advocate for a back-to-basics vanilla world of warcraft. much of our efforts was met with opposition from blizzard itself. after so many years there's finally enough demand for a re-release of vanilla world of warcraft as it was and now people want to add changes to make it more how they want with little regard to how people who've actually made an effort to get this shit back.
---
we all love world of warcraft, but we'll never get a perfect game. classic will be a new chapter in video gaming signalling a clear opposition to how the mmorpg genre has evolved over the years
---
You can't just blame this stuff to the players for 'not caring'. If a game gives you a weapon that allows you to beat the game by just clicking '1' every time you encounter an enemy, most people will use it to the point that the game is no longer fun for them. This is just how most people are wired.
---
Just like developers of single players have to be careful to not add stuff that trivialises the game, MMO developers need to be careful to not add stuff that trivialises social interaction. Because many many players will simply not do it if there isn't a clear benefit, and then they'll complain that there is no community.
---
Even worse, social interaction isn't a one way thing. Some players may be able to resist using the 'beat everything' weapon and still enjoy the game. But even if you resist taking the easy route of just not grouping, other people will be less prone to responding to your messages, they probably won't group up with you unless you prompt them, they'll probably find you annoying and like "wow this guy is forceful" for trying harder to become friends than the game naturally incentivizes you. It's also just damn demoralising to always have to be the guy that tries to start any form of social interaction because nobody else would do it as there's no reason to.
---
If social interaction is the thing that keeps an MMO going, then modern WoW is plainly a worse game than classic WoW on account of allowing precisely that to be trivialised and ignored.
---
Nice! Unique characters &gt; boring vanilla smoothskins.
---
Male or female undead mage? And tell me why..
---
It's pretty simple actually, I liked Vanilla for a lot of reasons and I want to play WoW Classic for those reasons. When I played a bit in Cataclysm the game was nowhere near as fun as Vanilla was.
---
This however does not mean I want to play WoW Classic just because it is like Vanilla, my reason for wanting to play it is because of the things that made it fun. That does in no way mean that Vanilla WoW was as flawless and from this perspective there is no reason not to make it better.
---
If you want to play WoW Classic because you want to experience ONLY the nostalgia then you are absolutely free to do so, I will of course do that too but I don't want the journey to end there.
---
Make sense?
---
Yeah,  if you don't have a way to break it or get lucky... you dead.
---
This is how we ended up with BFA, mind you. There will NEVER be a game that is fun for everyone. Classic doesn't seem like the game for you.
---
Well put.
---
if only they did...
---
&gt;looking up the spec and making my bars not knowing about the actual class is a real bummer so I quit after one match.
---
This is the reason you'll play for 3 months, (maybe) kill rag and then quit.
---
If you just want to know how 1 class works without knowing what other classes offer - that's some selfish dps only ever and will only result in a sour experience.
---
All the power to you, if you don't enjoy the game.
---
Afaik the weapon skill is very powerful and probably a must for min-maxers
---
And a smaller fraction would be/still are multi boxers.
---
"Not enough energy!"
---
If you respec often you will quickly see yourself paying the 50g cap to respec. 
---
If you respec away from raiding spec you'll have to respec back again in the same week. That's 100g and gold is a very limited resource. 
---
The most effective gold farming methods, for most classes, yields at most 30g - 40g pr. hour and that's if you're doing it perfectly. I'm not accounting for travel times, ghost walking if you die or getting corpse camped etc. Obviously mages and hunters are better at farming gold. 
---
On top of that you'll have to spend gold, each week, for raiding consumables and pvp consumables. That is a significant amount of time you have to spend just to be able to *respec*.
---
I guess they eventually realized balancing the entire game around something that ~0.5% of the population participated in was kind of stupid.
---
&gt;I mean I'm sure prot pally and guardian druid are both playable but is every group just going to want to find a prot warriors instead of testing their luck with the other classes?
---
Not really testing their luck - if you could pick a car that lasts longer than 2 others - you'd pick that one if you wanted the least amount of headaches.
---
they did with m+
---
Oh yes, for the love of Azeroth. That's the only change I welcome with  an open heart. Just disable them in instances and problem solved.
---
My response:
---
Are world buffs an exploit? Depends what definition you use, but either way it's blizzlike. In speedrunning, typically the difference between exploits and clever use of game mechanics, is that an exploit is a unintended mechanic being used in a unintended way, and clever use of mechanics is an intended mechanic being used in a unintended way. Worldbuffs are intended, they are intended to be able to be used in raids, but people stacking them to clear raids faster probably wasn't intended. That makes it clever use of game mechanics, since there's no bug or unintended mechanic.
---
For the pros and cons:
---
**Pros**
---
He mentions: 
---
1. Foster world pvp: I totally agree, it makes for some of the most amazing moments in vanilla.
---
2. Creates competitive play: Yes it most certainly does. Speedruns created with worldbuffs are some of the coolest things done, people even did them in vanilla BTW. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svS2QMEK7jI Notice titans, onyxia, DMF and DM buffs. 
---
3. Makes you feel stronger? Feels like this youtuber uses this pro to argue against world buffs like people don't want to remove world buffs because it make them weaker. This is such horseshit. 
---
4. Provide reward? I don't know what the fuck he means with this. 
---
My own: 5. It allows people to clear farm raids very fast. That's what it's used for. Farming the same content over and over again can get really boring, but that's vanilla, thunderfury is BiS until the end and there's always upgrades for people in the previous raids, so you have to farm them. Worldbuffing allows you to do this quickly, but also in a more fun way, because it provides a whole new organic "hardmode" which is clearing the raid without dying, so that you keep your world buffs. This was later enforced in wrath for example with the naxx undying and immortal achievements, in vanilla, people did this because it saved a lot of time.
---
**Cons**
---
1. World pvp is not organic: I don't know what the fuck he means by this. I quote: "World buff pvp is short lived, it's orienteded about ganking, one side just wants to get their buffs and go into the raid, and the other is just looking to stop them, once one side is victorious everyone moves on" So literally exactly how quest pvp is done? One just wants to quest, but the other ganks and steals the mobs and is done ganking then because he is done with the quest. Guess this youtuber wants to remove world pvp too?!
---
2. Creates cross-faction and cross-guild collusion:
---
Cross faction collusion is not allowed and players who do so will/should get banned. This hasn't been the case on the pservers that this youtuber played on, but that's not classic. Cross guild collusion is a good thing, it creates a good community even if it's about sabotaging others. 
---
3. Create forced requirement: Well yes? World buffs are good, guilds wants to be good, guild wants worldbuffs. You can say this about literally anything that helps your guild. 
---
4.  Limit game time &amp; social interaction: This is about raidlogging, a practice where you get the world buffs in advance then log off. People raid log for 2 reasons: A) They need to get buffs in advance becuase buffing is inconsistent and B) they don't have time / want to buff the day after. Point B) doesn't matter since the player can't play anyway. Lets look at A): People talk a lot about how world buffs have cooldowns in vanilla/classic, and they don't on pservers. There's a good reason. The cooldowns suck, and waiting for the buffs is annoying, that's why pservers removed them so everyone can get the buffs they need when they have to get them, I don't particularly want changes, but if you are gonna change something, then remove the cooldown (I'll talk about the next change in a min). Lastly, worldbuffing actually prolongs game time, if you are raidlogging then you only log in for raid, clear it and then log out. Log back in if you need consumes. That's all you do. With worldbuffing you are spending extra hours getting those world buffs, that's extra time put into the game.
---
5. Promotes false competition. Basically he says that you can't compete as a non world buff guild and that's "fake competition". Yes if you intentionally put yourself at a disadvantage you will be at a disadvantage. Holy shit lets move on.
---
6. Breeds toxicity? What? People who die get angry that they lose their buffs? What's next? You gonna remove graveyard runs because I get angry when I have to run back to my corpse? 
---
7. Trivalize PVE content: Do they? World buffs disappear on deaths making them essentially useless for progression unless if you specifically get lots of attempts on a boss, then go back and almost an hour getting world buffs, come back and have a better chance. That hardly trivializes anything, but I agree world buffs should be removed for progression, just like EVERY private server has done since nostalrius went down. First month of new raids no world buffs, that's the rule, and trust me those raids get cleared within 1 month by almost every guild. The latter guilds who don't clear it, well giving them worldbuffs is probably not going to help them since they are wiping due to failing mechanics. 
---
The only thing that world buffing "trivializes" is raids that they are already farming, so it's really pointless isn't it? Once a raid is on farm it's already trivial.
---
What role do druids do in PvP BGs? I like being a healer but it seems they don't really heal in BGs which sucks.
---
Arena doesn't interest me tho I would watch the shit out of retail/classic WSG.
---
I dunno I was too young and never reached 60 but I remember, as an Alliance player it always looked terrifying to see Horde players come down from their graveyard in WSG because they looked bigger and like monsters/beasts whereas we had Gnomes and Dwarfes and all were Humanoids...seeing Tauren Warriors with huge two-handers and those Orc shoulders was terrifying to 10 year old me.
---
I actually do stream so check it out TTV/Kyliemanogue. Make sure to follow so you can see the DW/Defiance tanking as soon as possible in MC. I'll make sure to have people clip when it doesn't work if it doesn't work.
---
LOL
---
are warriors viable in 1v1 duels at level 60 against every class?
---
I plan to minimize add-ons if at all possible. For instance don't need raid frame add-ons, the updated blizzard ones work great. 
---
I'd say WeakAuras is a must. A boss mod like BigWigs or DBM. Maybe a bar add-on deoen8 on what you need/want. A threat meter if available. 
---
Not much else is really needed.
---
Du sind sehr leichtgläubig
---
ITT: Everyone knows exactly what's going on in Blizzard's finance department.

Can you have 2 or more specs saved for faster respec?

Hi, /u/rangabeats

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c193q9/how_long_can_character_names_be/). 
---
Well I’m remembering from like 13 years ago but maybe 1g? Can’t get an exact price because every server would have been hundreds different based on the server economy.  
---
There are also people who will be MUCH smarter about earning money with 13 years hindsight so there’s a chance the economy in vanilla is very different from classic. 
---
But I would be prepared to spend as much as you do on your epic mount.
---
They should absolutely be playing with this. And when/if they re-release BC they should give you the ability to transfer your player from a Vanilla realm to a BC realm.
---
/spit
---
Male undead, female gnome. That’s the bottom line because Stone Cold said so.
---
I don't think you understand the subject we are actually discussing here. Aestethic doesn't have anything to do with the things you tried to use as an argument. Person has to be total fucking moron if he thinks people don't care how their character looks in a Role Playing Game. Also the fact that everyone looks their character at some point in WoW is a fact. There is a reason why transmog items are expensive in retail, why transmog got implemented in the frst place, why there are rp servers, why people can say what gear people are wearing just by looking at them. Because people actually cares how they character looks. Why would there even be character creation tool if nobody cared?
---
Nope. A friend of mine got it on the last wave, and he was inactive since November.
---
First of all thank you.
---
For the effort you put in to get Blizzard to even release WoW Classic.
---
Let me be very clear that I too want "back to basics" and that I do not at all like what WoW has become, and even became with start release of TBC. 
---
There are many things that have changed for the worse and some for the better.
---
One thing I do want you to consider though is that sooner or later people WILL get bored of WoW Classic if they do not release more content, I just rather they release Vanilla-like content instead of the original expansions. That is all, really, and taking the good parts from what the original WoW devs and designers were unable to add in Vanilla and put it into the game while maintaining "the basics" is in my opinion far superior to just re-releasing the expansions again.
---
I mean preraid you can go MS until you get 700 ap as i said when BT becomes usable. But yes you want to raid as 2H fury not raid as MS.
---
Here is problem I see with vanilla raiding; it is ruined by current meta.
---
15 years ago, you raid with whatever. Theres 40 slots so who cared, there wasn't really dps meters. Nowadays every one wants it optimized even if your guild only raids 2 nights a week. Everything needs to be tip top.
---
Love to see that old school mentality. Play whatever you want 🙏🏻👌🏻
---
I feel attacked
---
I mean you use it while getting Rok, and it is useful for taming pets. It helps reduce their damage a lot so if you are taming someone like Humar who is a 23 elite and hits like a fucking truck at that level it is very useful.
---
Ooga Gang is winning
---
Not at all.
---
Warriors would have trouble 1v1 with mages who can kite them quite effectively, warlocks can fear dot and sacrifice pet for massive shield, druids are sustain freaks and can outlast most in fights, and don't even get me started on shadow priests.
---
Warriors with a healer though can do quite a bit of damage if they aren't locked down.
---
I made a warrior as a "class I won't be playing in classic, probably" and I'm enjoying it way too much. -_-
---
No harm if people wanna spend more time outside of the raid preparing so they can clear the raid faster. Although, there's something ironic about that.
---
Thankfully (and I say this being an avid, many thousand games, arena player) classic is trying to be a competitive game. I would love it if WoW retail was one, and they got close to competitive norms in Legion, but it seems plain their simply incapable of not ruining things with dumb gear systems and as a result it never did become much of a competitive esport. If classic gets arenas later, we need to either treat it as a dumb novelty or template it completely.
---
It's not needed. But it's obviously easier/quicker if you use them. So if you are for some reason struggling with damage for a boss, then going and picking up world buffs would make your chance of killing that boss much higher. 
---
Good guilds definitely don't need them.
---
FUCK ironfoe that weapon is a curse. Dal Rends are good but very highly contested and trash is good but not as good as an AR. The post was about 2h Fury, and you can do competitive dps to DW with ARCANITE REAPER. Compared to the weapons that are available to someone going DW.
---
While I agree that there is a chance (eventhough a small one) that they will share the subs for both classic and retail I only think they will do it if they’re both impressive like “look, we hold the rank 1 and 2 for most played MMORPG in the world”. Why show that one of your games is doing bad just to prove a point?
---
If by options you mean reasonable alternatives, then no.
---
This is unequivocally false. In fact, arena was most fun when it was unbalanced.
---
You mean mage warlock rogue warriors and hunters right? Mortal shots is amazing.
---
So what you are saying is that every viable dps spec gets better? Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
---
maybe in your bracket, not in 2400+
---
&gt;15% chance to freeze from frostbite isn't very high when mobs die in just a few frostbolts anyway.
---
Not really actually. My lvl 40 frost mage has around +150 spell damage and despite doing almost 400 damage per frostbolt only casters die in 2-4 bolts without crits.
---
Frostbite also greatly increases your damage per mana because it essentially adds a large amount of crit percentage. If you're speccing for single target you should absolutely grab it. After all, DPM is one of the major reasons people choose frost over fire in the first place, and also one of the major reasons arcane missiles are so bad.
---
I doubt it, but it would be funny if after 15 years, the first game to finally out-WoW WoW was WoW.
---
I think you underestimate just how valuable gold is to the casual/mainstream player. A hardcore player farming gold could earn that much in 7-10 hours or so, but for the more casual player (and most of your market will be casuals) that's almost certainly over a week of savings. A lot of high quality world drops won't sell for that much, and those are usually a lot rarer, and a lot more useful.
---
Its the first stress test. Intro is a 40 second channel trailer, which is just a mix of game cinamatics and gameplay that doesn't exist on the channel, followed by 20 minutes of literally a raw rip from his stream. This is only levels 1 to 5.
---
Skip it.
---
The real way forward is TBC and Wrath because they deserve their favorite expansion just as much as we deserve vanilla.
---
Anything else is egoistic
---
Oh if i was going to level a shaman again i would 100% not go 2handed enhancement i don't like praying to RNGesus to get a fat windfury only to have to have it parry, dodge, miss. But yeah you are right shaman are super versatile when it comes to leveling and dagger and shield is a very effective way to level.
---
cc and dps
---
I played dwarf rogue once..
---
I'm playing orc rogue on classic :)
---
Today on my laptop in AV I was solidly 60-100 FPS at 1080p on medium. Even at 40v40. Id say the game is very nice optimised. Unsure if it’s multi core support but it’s at least using a core / thread well.
---
Spec:
---
i5 8250u (sat on over 3.0ghz all game)
---
Mx150 gpu 2gb (sat at 1500-1600mhz all game)
---
8gb 2400mhz ram
---
Booting off a m.2 solid state (fast load times)
---
Dis baby was only $549 USD in like April 2018.
---
If there is one thing I would trade classic for, it’s reverting the gaming industry back a good 20+ years. So much greed, so little integrity and vision atm.
---
Ah, sorry, multiglad here. I do not enjoy 15 minute games, 3-4 minute games was the best. Good setup oneshots were by far more fun than the current "balanced" bait all cds or mana before you can get a kill at all.
---
Human paladin
---
That is pure evil! You have to at least wait for the guild to take 100 arcanite bars from them. And then have them summon the boss and kill it for you.
---
&gt; minor improvements to Classic
---
I don't want "minor improvements". I want Classic as it was back in the day, and guess what, there's a lot of people that feel the same way. And as long as that's the case you can stick your "minor improvements" up your ass, because shit ain't gonna happen. Sorry not sorry.
---
This is exactly why you play horde. Where irl can you find the huts in durotar?
---
They did that in WotLK, every few weeks ICC got a little easier.
---
I get that they wanted the hardcore people to have a challenge while still allowing useless people to complete the content eventually, but i didn't like it for a couple of reasons;
---
One, its part of turning the game from an RPG into a theme park ride. Two, you might be a badass for a week or two wielding a big 2h weapon from the final boss and a kingslayer title, but after that first week or so *everyone* has them, and that takes away from the satisfaction of doing something difficult. Same tting with sartharion +3 drakes up; i did that on my rogue when it was actially bloody difficult. Later they nerfed it and then i didnt wear that title anymore because it no longer meant anything since a random PUG could do it in the bits of tier 8 they got from running trial of the crusader 5-mans.
---
Holy shit, I joined Stoic for a while. Right before AQ40 started up. I remember our first night downing Nef.
---
Of course, they understand that... it just doesn't make sense to think about the potential "future" of classic before it's even released.
---
Everyone likes to have an opinion on whether the game will die out in 6 months or thrive for 2+years.
---
It comes down to 2 guaranteed things -
---
1. WoW fans that enjoy playing the game to just simply play it and not only go for r14 or full naxx gear will be there 100% through until the end.
---
2. It's safe to assume 70-90% of players that Classic has in August / September of 2019 will NOT be around sometime between January 2020 and August / September of 2022.
---
People will fall of drastically if they aren't a part of group 1... and while this sub likes to pretend it's full of group 1 people - they aren't. Most will play, have fun and fall off.
---
To that point - there is no reason for anyone (including blizzard) to talk about content in 2021/2022 when the playerbase will be only the dedicated.
---
1 gold? Your epic mount cost between 800g and 1000g.
---
The whole "rogue overpopulated" is a meme at best.
---
Could you give me a link to when they announced this? Must have missed it
---
Lol the whole screen gets filled with these effects. It's just too much.
---
nah you dont need nerd autism for that.
---
for strat and scholo you only need holy water for aoe tanking.
---
 crystal charge farmin is easy if you are mining/herb in ungoro.
---
It's almost like the "you think you do, but your don't"-guy was right.
---
People have know idea what's happening in beta on this subreddit. Most of the time I see someone talking about beta it's obvious they aren't in it and they're just butt hurt they aren't playing. They make it sound bad for everyone else to make themselves feel better?
---
5 minute queues on horde side Saturday night, plenty of games running. One game lasted 40 minutes and both sides zerged like modern AV but most are 2-3 hours. One was a bad stalemate
---
But I’m a champion! Or so everyone tells me
---
High end guilds used them at least in Naxx to kill certain bosses. Basically they tried the boss a few times until they thought they could kill it with buffs, then went out of the instance and got all the buffs, then went back and tried the boss again.
---
Your comment is sitting beneath the comment about a swingers club in L.A. Made me chuckle.
---
Man that is real AV; along with Korrak in the middle. It really made it feel like a WC3 map inside WoW.
---
If you use your spells shaman are pretty good single target as well. Full t1 set they will use Healing wave. Which will cause it to heal 3 targets near by. So then that one generally becomes the tank healer to keep up Ancestral Fortitude on the main tank for the extra armor. In short shaman are incredible healers doesn't matter who they are healing.
---
Unless you are pushing for like world firsts none of the facials are NECCESSARY, be what you want to look at.  
---
You are going to be like 1 of 30 dps, a racial might add, what, like a maximum of 1% to your dps? So 1% of 3% of all the damage possible from you is tied to a racial.
---
Thered a defined meta and hard counters in vanilla, which means a high skill ceiling, but also stagnation if you don't get in early. 
---
Arenas could be an interesting addition precisely because classes are much more limited in self healing than they are now
---
Talk to us man, what choices have you got narrowed down? 
---
What role you feel like playing endgame?
---
Let us help you :)
---
Gold means something though so I'm finding myself excited for a 2h weapon to sell for 1g+. Need mount money!!
---
&gt;I would never take Frostbite. It just makes you better at kiting single mobs which you can already do indefinitely.
---
That's not true at all. Frostbite greatly increases a frost mage's DPS and damage per mana. They have much higher burst damage when Frostbite is paired with Shatter and Ice Shards.
---
No problemo brother
---
Who killed the king
---
It was a known thing. You can even see it in the Nihilum KT Kill to this day. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CNN_Cn2L2A 
---
You can see they are running darkmoon faire, warchiefs blessing, zg heart, songflower, zanza. The notion that no one used it during vanilla is pure bullshit.
---
It's been a thing ever since nostalrius shut down for every raid release.
---
Yeah, when they let you reinstall the classic beta, just in order to deinstall it properly 😂
---
Maybe check out some of Kargoz's guides. They employ educated guesses based on private servers, but he acknowledges that usually. Perhaps you can figure out what use you can make of the videos. There are a lot to view, but you mentioned in the comments that you were interested in hunter, so you could start with that one. 
---
The link goes to his Youtube playlists.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/user/jheldridge/playlists](https://www.youtube.com/user/jheldridge/playlists)
---
A large chunk of my epic mount gold came from buying and reselling whelplings in vanilla and if i remember correctly they sold for around 100G on my server. As someone has pointed out though server economies differ and we’ll just have to wait and see.
---
I get that but I don't really see the issue. The buff isn't needed or even efficient for real progress pulls and they only matter for speed running or pushing the last little bit of output you need for a kill.
---
I guess I just like the idea of cool buffs in the world and I don't mind if guilds who want to speed run need to do extra bullshit to get a small advantage as that is the reality of speed running.
---
Eh I hadn't played at the time, I shouldn't comment honestly but I'm just not seeing an issue with the system. I'd get it if it was after every wipe you had to leave the instance and travel for an hour to get fully buffed and that was the only way the bosses are doable but in the current iteration I'm just not seeing an issue.,
---
Sorry, meant 1K g
---
No, I'm aware of that, but its one raid.
---
This time around people will know to collect the correct resist gears, item sets, elixers etc So half the time sinks and barriers will be stopped before they are an issue.
---
Difference with naxx and the rest of the end expansion raids was time, the point of doing it, and skill levels.
---
So no, I haven't forgot, and I know how hard it was back then, but I'm also not naive enough to think that it will be the same this time.
---
No listening to the community plz. Just rebuild classic. Listening to the community is what destroys every game as it did with WoW
---
Yeah exactly.
---
&gt;hardly ever used in vanilla.
---
It was pretty rare and only really first used on naxx where the first real dps checks came, but since it WAS used like that, I see no reason why it wouldn't be used like that in classic either.
---
If It's mage closely followed by warlock then how is it mage by far??
---
&gt; The post was about 2h Fury, and you can do competitive dps to DW with ARCANITE REAPER.
---
Yeah and I'm saying you can't, lol.
---
A warrior with Dal'rend/Ironfoe/thrash blade will out DPS you big time.
---
I think Kungen has mentioned they grabbed Zg buff and Ony when fighting Loatheb and the last encounters when they thought they were close to a kill
---
Oh no worries! I'll keep checking now and then. Thanks! ^^
---
Most fishermen don't fish on the frontlines
---
If I wanted quick matches I would queue up for wsg/ab.
---
Where do we download addons for classic?  Looking for a couple simple ones like VendorPrice. Want to have them ready to go before launch. Thanks!
---
Yeah, but grounding totem *never* stopped Aoe's.  Only targeted spells.
---
But if it is stopping silence yeah I think that's a bug.
---
Yeah, I usually just wrote “mana” in chat that was enough
---
Are Priests the original Boomers?
---
* sipp water *
---
Ah, the Outlands were the shit back then man.
---
My 40 man raid bois fighting, me outta of mana and then
---
* sipp *
---
Boom bam I smite em all with my lvl 60 priest
---
Normies these days dont know the good ole days of sipp and grind I tell ya, those god damn zoomers and their medals for everything.
---
* sippppppp *
---
* slurp *
---
* cough *
---
Nice gatekeeping there son. Keep it up. You'll figure it out when buffing for MC in AQ40 gear.
---
Not sure about subs, as having one will allow access to both games, but I'm sure classic will register more active players than BFA.
---
To get this vanilla like touch you need to set your display res. To 1024x768 on the good old 4:3ratio  xD
---
It was posted 222 days ago and got 1.9k upvotes.
---
Here’s my reply to that notion: Fuck that. Nothing ruins a game as quickly as putting emphasis on micro transactions. In fact, this very defense only makes retail more dead to me (I’ve played all 14+ years of wow on and off).
---
Tauren rogue would go completely against the class fantasy, which was a big point of emphasis for the class designers.
---
It stopped being an RPG years ago, and it's not even much of a multiplayer game anymore. As someone else mentioned you rarely see the same players twice, and much of the content is designed to be done solo.
---
It is still an online game, gotta give it that. Take away the 'MM' and 'RPG'...
---
Retail WoW is an O.
---
&gt; Eh I hadn't played at the time, I shouldn't comment honestly but I'm just not seeing an issue with the system. 
---
I haven't played much vanilla end game either. But I've heard several people who have complain about world buffs, and I haven't heard anyone defending them who actually has used them a lot. 
---
&gt;I get that but I don't really see the issue. The buff isn't needed or even efficient for real progress pulls and they only matter for speed running or pushing the last little bit of output you need for a kill.
---
Doesn't matter if they are needed or not, players are competing against each other, at least dps, and when you can get an advantage over others by collecting world buffs a lot of people will want to do that to get ahead of other players in the raid. And then you end up with an entire raid doing that just to not fall behind everyone else, even if it's not needed at all.
---
Neat.
---
Nelf Hunter you can bait people so hard if you have a non stealth pet put your pet somewhere hand have it stay then run 20-30 yards away from it behind a tree and shadowmeld. This works really well against mages. They will lot of time rez ontop of your pet and pop Frost nova. Thinking you are sitting there stealthed right on top of your pet. Then you just start aimed shotting them from the shadows and have your pet start attack. I used to do this all the time with my Wind Serpent on the private servers.
---
the majority will likely not PVP as always.  
---
plus the number of players who don't know the full mechanics of their class can be astounding. classic will certainly handicap a few people who only have played the more recent expansions.
---
I’ve played parts of maybe 10 AV matches, on various characters, and PVP is not my thing. I’ve submitted 3 big reports. That’s actually the entire point of the weekend, to help them catch bugs so on 8/27 it doesn’t have many bugs.  
---
The beta isn’t classic, anyone who got an invite is a free game tester for blizzard. I would much rather quest too but if they don’t get ample people playing these areas they won’t have a working product in August.  
---
Also, complaining to a sub with 130K subscribers, most of which are dying for invites they don’t have, is a little tone deaf
---
Racial aren't even that strong, by that logic racials are 1/3rd of your dps lol 
---
But your point remains valid, if you aren't chasing world firsts then pick what you wanna look at bro
---
Release a TBC server. Done.
---
I did..... other than the zergfest at field of strife..... what's missing?
---
Which is good
---
You just open a tab and get your heirlooms and your level one mount the instant you spawn
---
I prefer to read the options and make a choice based on how I feel like playing. Does that mean I may have a less viable spec? Yup. I don’t care to make the optimal choice.
---
IMO without pet battles pets will have far less value in Classic. People will still buy them but I wouldn’t expect to see them fetch extremely high gold prices.
---
Nah i played ally that fucking mace is a curse. I will never use it again. Because as soon as it starts to fall off you get he off hand from AQ40 and it brings it back up again. So if you use IF you won't replace it until naxx. But you will fall behind super hard. Trash won't out DPS an AR if you know what you are doing. The gearing stages early and lack of hit/crit for fury the 2 handed is better suited especially as orc for the extra 5 skill. I mean i prefer DW. But i will be tanking. I would probably try to scoop a felstriker and a heart seaker as a warrior. Dagger warriors are fucking strong as fuck.
---
Keybind water and before a pack dies spam that key, so you can drink while the tank pulls another pack
---
I think this thread proves there need to be dedicated shamans and priests purging and dispelling world buffs from these meter whores.  
---
We get it, you’ll still clear MC.  But you’ll cry first.
---
Real talk though all those level 40-somethings who want to duel people 10 levels lower have really small peepees.
---
Does anyone know what the trash rotations for a Aff Lock and Frost or Fire Mage would be? What about single target rotation in Dungeons?  I plan on mainly playing Dungeons and all the info im finding is specific to Raids. Thanks in advance.
---
You freeze on average every 6-7th cast. My point is that it's not a reliable way to kill mobs due to the relatively low proc chance. So if you want to spec an AoE build you will still do fine on single target. 
---
Obviously if you spec for single target you pick it.
---
You're the one gatekeeping by criticizing everyone else's opinion because they didn't go into Naxx.
---
What the other poster said isn't gatekeeping at all...
---
&gt;   So if you use IF you won't replace it until naxx.
---
Why's that bad?
---
Is there a macro that automatically yells out when certain spells are resisted? For example; I'm a Hunter in a dungeon and my task is to freezing trap a certain mob. The trap gets resisted, and I want to let my group know it got resisted. I could ofcourse manually push a macro that yells "Trap resisted", but I was wondering if there's a way it triggers automatically when it resists.
---
Thanks in advance.
---
No, this is retarded. If you don't want to use world buffs then don't.
---
It will be hugely popular for the first month or two, especially considering everyone with a retail sub already has free access to it.
---
It'll die down to just the dedicated players pretty quickly though.
---
Both were best when there was source material to work from.
---
Who says you have to follow someone else's build? I'm going to be using this because I'm so hyped about classic I'm writing my own spec now, and I don't want to forget it by the time release rolls around.
---
Well it's not talk. Jokes aside I wanted dwarf mage but blizzard removed it 😟
---
I mean yeah it is nice. But the problem being you really start falling behind dps wise of the other members of your guild and no one is willing to give you upgrades or thats how it was in the guild i was in. We will have to see on the state that IF is come classic. Because if it is not on a PPM basis it may be super fucking good. But i am still going for a felstriker hands down for my warrior. Going to rock double daggers until i can get TF/Maladath for tanking.
---
Nah, you're just talking shit and now you don't know what to say. Proves my point tho.
---
It's the same subscription, so no?
---
All this thread proves is that there's a disturbingly large portion of this community who hates anyone who has a different playstyle than them.
---
Can't tell if trolling or actually retarded
---
And then you sit in the raid doing way less damage then everyone else of your class just because you didn't pick up world buffs. Doesn't feel very nice.
---
If you AOE you don't get it because it breaks mobs up. If you spec single target you get it because it adds 7.5% crit to your frostbolt.
---
It’s the sun reflecting off of the snow and it’s not wrong.  Day/Night lighting.
---
As a hunter, basically any kind of mage. 
---
I just don't fucking know what to do once they use Frost Nova and dead zone me.
---
More like this sub doubled in size in about two months, and it's now filled with people who have no interest in preserving Classic as it were.
---
4 deaths on purpose wew lad. Interesting to see that becoming such a heavily used strategy!
---
Pvp servers in 2019 kekekekekek.
---
It’s 2019. If you have enough computer literacy to install an addon, then you can alt+tab and use a guide.  This doesn’t do anything substantial.
---
Banking at its finest
---
And for the PvE part (the MDI) it was the same. Very low viewer numbers, compared to Classic.
---
I don't know how many will play Classic, but I know that it will be vastly more popular than Retail.
---
And not only at launch, but all the way until retail is moved to mobile.
---
I’ve been playing shadow priest AV and haven’t found a class that can beat me 1v1.
---
Even took down a void sacrificing warlock yesterday.
---
If you want new content, play Retail. Classic is made because some ppl wanted it and i doubt Blizz will ever add anything new there because sooner of later ppl would start complaint that it sux and want classic back.
---
Dude i sure hope this is the case i want to see people running around with their zergling pets!
---
Imagine getting corpse camped in STV and then having to further hamper your leveling by losing XP at spirit healer lmao
---
"oom" master race
---
The ogres in SW Tanaris. There's this one spot with like 20 of them and they all respawn just as you finish killing them if you go as fast as possible. Also they're the right level range for edgemaster's if you're stupidly lucky.
---
It’s a better game.
---
I am still undecided which is worse : S8 GoT or BfA.
---
Probably because both are shit, and it's hard to determine which shit smells less worse than the other.
---
Hunters basically never have to respec, though I'd get imp. FD for trib runs if that's a thing. Mara solo can be done as MM spec though it's a few mins slower than BM spec, but you can only reset instances so many times an hour anyway.
---
&gt; I haven't heard anyone defending them who actually has used them a lot. 
---
Because you haven't been on private servers much then. Getting world buffs is another activity that strengthens the social bonds within your guild, and adds an another incentive to stay alive during what can otherwise be some quite stale raid encounters. It only takes like 15-20 minutes to get them, and DM Tribute is a pretty fun dungeon.
---
Is it confirmed by blizzard or is it another "these elites definitlely don't hit as hard as like back in 2005 !!" while they actually do??
---
It is funny to think guilds with meme specs will struggle, they won’t.  The private server autists min/max so they can epeen over killing rag in 2 minutes.
---
Bro you got arcane power.... not ice block
---
I like the HoA and HoN buffs since they encouraged player interactions between different guilds. My oldest brother told me that his guild and three other guilds on the server would schedual when to use them so that they all would benefit from the buff as they were on 6(?)hour CD.
---
Yeah... the kind of guild that expects everyone to spend hours getting world buffs isn't going to be bringing a feral DPS in the first place.
---
I did a check from a top guild on a pserver lately. If you averaged out the dps of each raid mages, warlocks and hunters are very close to even. Warlocks get better over time, so in full naxx they were pumping.
---
It's not necessarily about raid leaders forcing it on people. People do it willingly themselves just to top meters. And then everyone else feel pressured to do it as well to keep up.
---
The AV test is actually a good metric for getting the feel of vanilla classes
---
If forums are to be believed wow has been dead since 2005
---
Does Blizzard actually need all the time up to August 26th or are they delaying release for just marketing purposes?
---
Long as items are not a factor it could be worth checking out its competitive potential. If items is a factor in it, it will be an entertaining novelty.
---
Frost Nova was more important.
---
Druids are definitely viable. They are the best 3rd tank in the game running two warriors then a feral druid for tank 3 is awesome. It helps better distribute the loot between the main and off tank without having to worry about a 3rd warrior that you need to also give gear to. Bears have high armor which means they have about a 70% damage reduction on hits and then their high hp pool also adds to their success. Bears are great tanks don't think otherwise. That is why my guild will be running on.
---
\-Kyliemanogue Main Tank of &lt;Participation Totems&gt;
---
uh huhuhuhuhuhuh
---
Ah fudge, good point, I forgot about those, my memory mixed old DM with new DM (which still has goblins, actually &gt;.&gt;)
---
If I were to level my shaman as resto for ease of finding dungeon groups, would Healing Grace be worth taking? If so, should I invest 3 talent points to max out?
---
Wasn't written by me, was written by /u/Undoer who is a mod of this sub.
---
I know this is kinda late... but could you explain why it is more difficult to gear them on Alliance?
---
100% disagree with the premise of the video, that "world buffs are exploits" and the idea that anything that isn't developer intention is automatically an exploit. Regardless, these buffs were put in the game with consistent ways to obtain them. From that fact, we can surmise that you are intended to be able to get them.
---
Literally the same guy did a video on mage, obviously he gets his own ignite, but he doesn't get others.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFwzGm81e10
---
So yeah.. Also here's warrior at 2k https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHizolVdLJ4
---
I dont understand why people have this problem.
---
Are you running with goggles to help you see stealth and running as sub for increased stealth level? If not you should probably do that.
---
Pet collecting was still a thing in Vanilla. I expect it will be a thing in Classic too.
---
dae
---
Not going to happen.  They  don't want to admit publicly how bad retail has gotten.  Announcing subscriber numbers was only in their best interest as long as the population was growing.  Once it started to contract \*eyes calendar\* a decade ago, it no longer made business sense to tell.
---
And they have a point really.  Perception is key.  If people think a game is dying, new players stay away, existing players begin to divest their interest.  I'm not sure it's even remotely fair to hold Vanilla/TBC/Wrath numbers against them though.  World of Warcraft grew into a fad during that period.  Since then, those kinds of gamers have moved on to other fads like squad based shooters, MOBAs, and Battle Royale.
---
If classic is a big enough success though, they may announce something like "WoW subscriptions numbers jump XXX,XXX in August for release of World of Warcraft: Classic"
---
That explains why Babbage's had a big PC game selection. Did not know this.
---
Level as enhance, you can still heal dungeon groups and dungeons will not be the main source of experience at all.
---
Undead Frost mage, because unless your specifically designed to counter then or have some overwhelming advantage you're doomed. Especially if your a warrior. 
---
Hard to tell if they are UD combat rogues are the most OP
---
I was thinking that in November 2018. Once BfA dropped in August 2018, I was almost convinced, but was still thinking. Today, I stopped thinking. I am 100% certain that Classic will not only have more players, but it will have 2-3 times more players than BfA, long term, and it will blow out the water BfA numbers on August 27th, by a factor of 5 or 6.
---
And even if you do a lot of single target you can still consider not picking it just so that AoE is an option.
---
It doesn't take more than a few minutes if someone else in your 40 man raid already cleared DM Tribute, and most guilds won't require you to get them for lower end content anyway.
---
If you have such a strong aversity to "time sinks", vanilla really isn't for you, because vanilla really is all about those time sinks, and preparation. The raids themselves aren't what takes the most time.
---
Things to do when classic drops:
---
1. Create Macro to ask for water
---
2. Create macro to ask for mage friend 
---
3. If 1 and 2 fail, kidnap said mage.
---
Gonna be fun
---
???? 1 gold is peanuts
---
No, they got downvoted for the inv thing.
---
Just trying to engage you on your level, what you stated pretty much boils down to "hurr don't play the game if you don't like it" which is not constructive in the least and fucking gatekeeping. I mentioned Naxx because your  noob ass have never been getting wbuffs 2x a week and have absolutely zero clue what you are talking about, my arguments stems from having actually tried this and found it to be cancer, yours from "you think you do but you don't".
---
But this is reddit so I guess we cannot avoid fools like you, go back to watching assmon.
---
Well I’ve personally found several bugs in AV and I’m sure they have gotten thousands of reports, and they still have untested areas. They need time to identify then time to fix.
---
You may very well be correct in that many people will drop off but even so, I would not want Classic to die out because I didn't do as much as I could to keep it alive. As Tips points out, 35% of people who play on private servers aren't playing for nostalgia at all. 
---
From my perspective I would very much want to keep playing WoW Classic forever but there is literally no way I will do that once I have finished all the content.
---
Goddamn, put a loud volume tag on this. I was sitting there turning it up to hear him speak and then he had to fucking yell.
---
:o 71 days  *Happy little claps*
---
Classic == vanilla. That’s what people asked for. That’s what they’ll get.
---
If you want more there’s other unofficial options out there I guess.
---
SP+Mage
---
My point is that these tards have never tried getting wbuffs 2 a week - then they too would realize how aids it is and stfu with their "classic isn't for you go play something else" bullshit.
---
That's good to hear. I'd rather wait and it be polished.
---
Www.willitclassic.com probably but anything for current or private servers won’t work
---
The only guilds who require this are those going for server speedrun records.
---
You don't _have_ to join a super hardcore guild. Nobody is forcing you.
---
As a tank, most annoying player is a mage with blastwave.
---
Easy on the cough syrup
---
It happened with runescape, wouldn't be surprised at all if it happens here.
---
Will probably end up just like OSRS though, in the fact that even though more people play OSRS (classic) jagex makes far more money off of RS3 (retail) because of microtransactions.
---
Early game when the total gold on a server is relatively low I would agree with that. On a mature server however where the total gold has had time to expand I wouldn't sell it for less than 700-1K gold. My opinion however is based entirely on my experiences in vanilla on my server. That being said, as with all the threads trying to predict the future, in classic your mileage may vary. :)
---
One of these things is not like the other...
---
And with Classic, it won't happen. Because Blizzard will announce new content for Classic before the numbers will plummet.
---
Or do you think they are so dumb not to do it, and somehow missed the OSRS massive decline?
---
An actual good use of the slippery slope meme, damn I'm actually impressed.
---
Sweet summer child. You'll see... You'll see.
---
I'm intimate with all of the invisible walls, i've spent a lot of time breaking them in Retail. Sticky walls are brutal, when I get stuck sometimes i'm stuck so hard I have to log off for 15 minutes just so I get teleported out of the dungeon. Sticky walls are very similar to not being in an ADT (basically SUPER edge of the world, literally no saved information there, so you're unable to move as there's no grid to snap to). I can safely say that this here isn't that, and as someone who got to Hyjal on the stress test I don't think there's any sticky walls in Classic. GM island was ripped out of the game and we lack the critical items required to break through invisible walls so I don't think they'll use em. However, anything is possible
---
Agreed. Classic is a « little » gift on the side. Their product/focus is mainly the retail version (WoW wise).
---
They're desperately trying to redefine the word "exploit" so they don't have to admit that it's actually a balance change that they want to make to Vanilla.
---
"The devs didn't expect people to use world buffs in raids, so it must be an exploit!" doesn't make any sense in a game where players farm a bunch of Manual Crowd Pummelers to use as disposable weapons in raids.
---
Yes but you will also spend a good time focusing on totem and most of all mana management. Down ranking spells is something that is important
---
That 30 year old holy priest boomer
---
WoW changed for the worse in many ways with TBC and lost much of what made it successful to begin with, gear was very easily accessable and questing was in nowhere as hard as it used to be to name a few.
---
That said I did already leave that open as a possibility and, as was also pointed out, there is no "right" answer.
---
Don't forget there's no crystal water until phase 2
---
There goes your 2g though.
---
This is somehow worse quality than the end of Roguecraft 1 where they made fun of videos like this.
---
That's fair, honestly, i've just met too many people that are serious when they declare their opinion as fact
---
Because you said level 20 I'd like to prophesies that all you will care about around 30+ is affording your level 40 mount. Don't spend anything other than skills because you don't need it. We used to say level 56 is half the game so a mount will make up for any possible non-spent gold.
---
Plan tree to the point that you can respec with you first 5 gold after buying the mount.
---
I get the advantage part 100%, but I'm actually ok with it when people want to push. I doubt players will go to that effort in every day farm. Might be completely wrong on that but on live you don't see people popping runes on farm yet its much easier to get because its not worth the effort. Ofc runes give less then the world buffs in terms of output but I think the same thought process will apply to the majority of players
---
People will collect them for sure. But without the associated game play loops like pet battles, pet dungeons and achievements IMO they will be less sought after. 
---
Also the economy will be very small for a while while every is leveling up, dealing with gold sinks like new spells/abilities, repairs and mounts. After a while the economy will normalize when the player base is more stable and established and disposable income is more a thing.
---
Buddy, you've never been in a group with me.
---
&gt; If you don't want to use world buffs then don't.
---
The ultra-competitive people are upset that they'll have to get world buffs to compete in speed runs.
---
And that's the dumbest reason ever to start asking for balance changes to Classic.
---
I don't know man...Classic will have the same effect as Vanilla. Or crack. I expect a large number of player to be hooked by the best MMORPG that ever existed.
---
I don't see a massive loss of players for Classic in the first month or first 3 months. Later on, yeah, maybe.
---
The icon is originally from the WC3 warden. And they changed it to a dwarf head as I now know thanks to you. Interesting.
---
The same thing could be said for consumables really, and spending 45 minutes setting up spreadsheets for whatever 10 potions/elixirs I'd need to buy mats for every raid night was way _way_ more boring than just flying down to Feralas, or going to STV where there'd always be a looming threat of PvP which made it exciting.
---
You could keep chipping down on every little bit of raid preparation but at some point you just gotta accept vanilla for what it was. It wasn't perfect. The raid encounters themselves weren't what took the most time, it was preparing for them.
---
I keep dungeon lore consolidated to the dungeon itself. The Defias are much larger than just the Deadmines, as their story can be followed from level 1 in Northshire, continued throughout Elwynn Forest and Westfall, and reaches a high point in the Deadmines. But it doesn't stop there: the Defias story line pushes you forward through the Stockades, the entire Missing Diplomat quest chain (Duskwood, Wetlands, Dustwallow Marsh), and culminates in the Onyxia attunement quest chain.
---
That's a lot to cover just for talking about the Deadmines, no? There's a far grander story to be told.
---
Thanks for trying it out!  I actually do not have access to the beta so this alpha build is currently untested.  That specific error was caused by a change in 8.1.5 that I had to make when I tested the it quickly in retail, guess that specific change didn't make it over to classic.  
---
I'll fix it shortly.
---
That is untrue, lock + healer is pretty insane 2v2
---
More likely is that shit where ur 100% oom, fight ends, you sit to drink and immediately the tank is running off for the next pack.  Sees that at this point you're 50% mana from drinking and assumes it's ok to pull but forgets that you're 100+ yards out of range and dies before you can run back in range in time.
---
They didn't have to change mob stats or decrease xp per level to make leveling significantly easier over the course of Vanilla. Just fixing bugs, adding content, and revamping talent trees was more than enough to make 1.12 leveling significantly easier than 1.2. Warrior in particular was absolutely miserable to level at launch compared to 1.12, due to rage fixes and talent changes.
---
Anyone who actually played Vanilla should understand this just from their own experience playing the game.
---
Hell, I'll take it one further. I don't even know which faction, let alone race/class
---
how hard was it to recover your old photobucket? i had one with wow screenshots way back in the day too
---
Indeed. Which would make the logical thing to do if one drops for you whilst leveling to stick it in the bank for a couple of months. Unless you are a collector like me in which case you go "Oh goody!" \*click\* :D
---
That's why they could add fresh servers and treat them like seasons- quicker phase windows, leaderboards, certain season buffs.
---
I would have left d3 in the dust years ago if seasons weren't a thing.
---
He's referred to hunter so much I would accept it.  With taumeril, the magical bow he and cattie use, and guenhwyvar his summon friend.  I could see Hunter working.   
---
Entreri for rogue 🤷
---
Same happened to PUBG, while it's still popular it's total player base "especially in North America" is a fraction of it's former self
---
Why? To preserve the feeling of classic right, for all its glory and failures. I was in a top tier guild (and they also did an interview with a guy from DnT) and world buffs weren't used in PvE. 
---
People say no changes to preserve the experience, and I agree with that outlook. Removing world buffs in raids would actually be a change to continue to preserve the experience.
---
Fap 3 times
---
Yeah spriests are busted 1v1, so many tools, heals and mana burn.
---
Piles of murdered kobolds stacked up behind it too!!
---
Surprised I haven't seen anyone mention this yet, but the main reason entire guilds clash in large scale world PvP as they head into Blackrock Mountain, or get their buffs in STV, is to try to kill them for their world buffs. It is a _major_ world PvP content driver.
---
have you actually watched the video?
---
Although melee leeway is bugged to an extent, wouldn’t removing that further make warriors’ lives more miserable?
---
what's with people's obsession to disable their brains completely? it's frightening.
---
&gt; I don't want "minor improvements".
---
Thank you for sharing your very interesting opinion. But you are not the centre of the universe.
---
Female for both.
---
I've raided in vanilla for years, in hardcore guilds. You're delusional.
---
They should have balanced Arena and PvE separately. Other MMOs used to do this (like Guild Wars 2) and WoW Arena had a big enough audience and competitive scene to do this. Sad that they didn't, absolutely loved Arena, pretty much did nothing but arena for the entirety of WotLK
---
This is why i sell water in town for whatever people are willing to tip, up to a full mana bar of water conjuring
---
Every BfA patch is hit by content drought 4 weeks later. It's a cycle of 3-4 months, with the last 2-3 months being content drought.
---
The speed at which players clear content in BfA is stupidly fast. And that is because the game is fast. Make it SLOWER and the content drought doesn't exists for 90% of the players.
---
Classic won't have content drought for 2 years. Classic players won't play BfA because of content drought...there isn't any. But BfA players will solidly play Classic, because 60-70% of their time in BfA is content drought.
---
And slowly, but surely, the majority of BfA players will migrate to Classic as their MAIN game.
---
Buy wait, I moved a EU character to US when I moved from England to MA in 2013. I just contacted customer service and they moved my account! Worth a try

Is orc shaman vastly superior to troll?  I really like trolls animations and model, but orc just seems really good on paper.   I haven't yet decided to go with resto, enh, or ele.
---
...level one mount?
---
&gt; 24 hour AV s are no fun and pointless.
---
You went there to farm HK's. The old AV also felt more like an actual war, that could last a long time. Which many found appealing.
---
Sam was clearly a paladin
---
I downvoted this... A game ruiner really
---
&gt; inconsequential and has little substance
---
It's also utterly shit and boring.  World Quests get very tired after the first couple of days and island expeditions are a joke.  Just an aoe-fest with no story or challenge.  I did one, and have never went back.  As for warfronts....my god.
---
I unsubbed 6 months ago when I realised all I was doing outide of raids was farming transmog.
---
Not at all sir
---
Arena died because pvp in wow i so bad these days it barely even feels like the buttons you press make any difference.  There's this strange disconnect between player agency and actual ability effect on your target.
---
Join the Ooga gang.
---
So, Marcooga.
---
&gt; blizzard is going to start off at the highest point at launch and rapidly decline. 
---
That is speculation. Yes, there will be a decline, it's an educated guess...but "rapidly decline" is speculation.
---
I think reflector is must vs mages
---
Looking back, a lot of people needed the world bluffs because they wore those terrible pre change tier 1 sets
---
Not classic but in Cataclysm chaining heroics I loved getting Deadmines because the Goblins dropped water and I would stock up.
---
Thanks!  My next addon will be a tool to inform you of which trainer abilities are available to you at each even level, and if you have CTP installed it will suggest skipping the visit if you have hidden the skills at that level.  I'm still trying to figure out the best way to present that info, though.
---
That doesn't sound like a very good reason to start making balance changes to Classic though.
---
I don't disagree that the game would be better without world buffs in raids.  But I also think the game would be better with Paladin tanks having a taunt, Druid tanks hitting defense cap, and guild banks available.  However, we probably shouldn't go mucking about with those things until after Classic has run its course.
---
No problem, mate. If I can be of any assistance (having beta access) to help you develop this addon please feel free to let me know.
---
Blizzard already announced addons like Decursive will not work any more in Classic because it goes against the spirit of the game, so you're in good company on that opinion.
---
I cannot imagine playing without Auctioneer or some other auction addon tbh. The auction house is just not a part of the game I want to devote a significant portion of my attention span to. Keeping track of all the different prices is damn near impossible, not to mention time-consuming, so having an addon take care of that is just my way of allowing myself to focus on other parts of the game I actually like, while still feeling like I'm not getting scammed every time I need to pick up a stack of wool or whatever.
---
Questie is a tricky one. I'm incredibly glad that I didn't use it or any of its compatriots when I first played in vanilla. But now I'm at the point where I know most of these quests anyways, and questie is nice for reminding me about the quests that are weird and off the beaten path. It's a good way to find and experience all the game has to offer. Not to mention if I couldn't find a quest mob or whatever, I'd just be looking it up on wowhead anyways - this just saves me some time. That being said, I am considering playing without it given I'll be leveling alliance, which I have little experience with. 
---
I think for some people it's also simply because the leveling experience is not why they play the game - they play for endgame content, challenging PvP, etc. Like why I use auctioneer, they use Questie so that they can spend less time in the parts of the game they don't enjoy and more in the parts that they do. It's the same reason I'll be using an addon that automatically sells all my greys, or that switches between my gear sets at the push of a button (outfitter): it's shit I've done a million times, and at this point, having to do these minor things again will reduce my fun.
---
Yeah some mounts you can now use immediately
---
I mean AV is cool but I wouldn't want to do it for an entire weekend on a character that I don't give a fuck about.

Thats why NE is OP run abit back shadowmeld Then Rez after they died.

 [https://www.wow-auctionhouse.com](https://www.wow-auctionhouse.com/) private server data but still relevant perhaps
---
also gives terrible logic https://clips.twitch.tv/RamshackleCheerfulWebEleGiggle
---
Yeah I don't think it was, pretty sure it was still a thing late into BC.
---
You don't need world buffs for Naxx. Most guilds in actual Vanilla either didn't use them or only used then rarely to get first kills. Private servers turned them into way more of a thing than anyone (outside the literal world first guilds) in real Vanilla ever did.
---
I highly advise against trying to walk before you can crawl. Learn a bit of programming in general before you jump into addon or mod creation.

MY GF (who never played WoW so far) took a glance at this picture this morning when I was browsing reddit. Her reaction: "Ohh.. I would like to marry you THERE. I broke into laughter and was like "Ya, I can definitely make that happen. Let's login."

yep 11pm on bankholiday monday.
---
I always felt the opposite and assumed other hunters were assholes like me, SO I would gank them
---
Some people like a challenge. Making an unviable spec work is way more fun and creative then reading a spreadsheet on how to get that extra 1% out of something that is meta.
---
Lol literally isn't - it's the sole reason they implemented layering at launch - confirmed by blizzard themselves. 
---
Ckassic wow will not be bigger than it's going to be on August 26/27 - welcome to gaming in 2019.
---
If I could cherry pick, I would personally like to have TBC and Wrath content at some point too, although not maybe having all the changes they brought to the game. Skip Cata, it was a catastrophe. MoP content (especially monks) would be nice to have as the next phase after Wrath. Probly no need to bother on other expansions after that, nothing so memorable. Maybe BfA races if they are good (haven’t played so no idea).
---
So basically, for me, keeping the game mechanics etc mostly on the classic level, but bringing additional content and classes would be a dream scenario. Basically a fork from classic with additional zones. 
---
I understand this kind of personalization isn’t possible as everyone would have their own preferences - but one can always dream...

I was an undead priest.. I think I'm gonna try a warlock or a mage.
---
Yeah looks like it.  Interesting that such a 'rural' looking chapel is actually in a cemetary/park in London.
---
Thanks, I edited for clarity. Listening can be misunderstood.
---
I wouldn't say it's vastly superior, but it's definitely better for enhancement. It's objectively worse for ele/resto, unless you plan to PvP a whole lot. The Orc stun resist racial is really strong.
---
I'd still strongly advice you to go for the race you feel the most for. You're going to spend a lot of time looking at that character.
---
&gt; but I know that it will be vastly more popular than Retail
---
Don't think so. The high-end raiding scene is definitely going to stick with retail WoW. And among the casuals I think the majority will not come to enjoy the delayed (sometimes VERY delayed) gratification system of Classic compared to the instant gratification system of retail WoW.
---
boo fucking hoo some people are going to suck at a game. why does that concern you?
---
On private servers today, nobody really needs the buffs, even with the poorly itemized gear. Most of the early encounters are faceroll, and they'll be even more faceroll today since private servers grossly overtune elite NPC damage. People mostly get it just for rankings.
---
People who think they'll be forced to get world buffs for MC today in a non-speedrun guild are just creating fictional problems for themselves.
---
Ion Hazzikostas: "You think you know something Jon, but you don't"
---
&gt; Competitve arena died because of lack of balance.
---
Competitive arena has been dead since like 2014/2015, which is when the class homogenization and streamlining started taking place. Competitive arena was most "alive" during the earlier days of WoW arena, when the game was arguably very imbalanced.
---
Blasted Lands is inspired by my toilet, when the dead winds pass.
---
Cool video.  I played beta and I don't remember bandages not being a channeled spell.  It was a long time ago, though.  Also thoroughly enjoyed watching the warlock get wrecked haha
---
&gt; And then you sit in the raid doing way less damage then everyone else of your class just because you didn't pick up world buffs. Doesn't feel very nice.
---
It's probably not going to feel very nice for Mages to do 25% less DPS than fury warriors in BWL, but that's the imbalance of Vanilla.
---
At least getting world buffs is probably less effort than rerolling to a class that just does way more DPS.
---
Honestly I understand that the game would probably be better without world buffs in raids, but that's a balance change that I'd put way below things like taunts for Paladin tanks and defense cap for Druid tanks.  We're getting 1.12 Vanilla and that's probably for the best.
---
Jesus these REEEE replies. 
---
For 99.999999999999999999999999999999% of players and raids, world buffs were never used like they are on private servers. Removing them for raids is actually preserving the vanilla experience, and you really have no argument against that. The concept of no changes isn't so that autists can sperg out on forums, it is for the underlying concept of preserving the experience.
---
Since HS has such long CD, dying is just a free HS. You also unequipp first and the further you get into the Levels, the less this strategy is viable which is why the "abuse" is as much used as possible in early levels to get ahead.
---
Get the spell crit chance. It will be better for ele as previously stated. Ele can blow people the fuck up!

If you live in Stokey, London then it probably is.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abney_Park_Cemetery
---
Things are worth what people are willing to pay for them. Initially, the pet will not be worth as much as people's priorities will be gearing up, getting mounts etc. As people accumulate more gold over time, and start to accomplish their initial priorities, the pet will increase in value. Thus, these types of rare vanity items are best saved for a more mature server perhaps 6-12 months after release to be put up on the AH.
---
**Abney Park Cemetery**
---
Abney Park cemetery is one of the Magnificent Seven cemeteries in London, England.
---
Abney Park in Stoke Newington, in the London Borough of Hackney, is a historic parkland originally laid out in the early 18th century by Lady Mary Abney and Dr. Isaac Watts, and the neighbouring Hartopp family.
---
In 1840 it became a non-denominational garden cemetery, a semi-public park arboretum, and an educational institute, which was widely celebrated as an example of its time.

I thought I had settled into Hunter but Priest and Mage are still calling my name...
---
You are failing to see the big picture here.
---
Retail patch design and fast game paced design, makes most retail player clear the content in the first 4-5 weeks, than simply unsub. Basically, the average retail player is spending maybe 30-40% of an expansion subbed, and 60-70% unsubbed.
---
Now, with Classic...they won't have to unsunb. They WILL play Classic. And Classic have a very powerful addiction effect. 
---
BfA will stop losing subs...but they will lose players. To Classic. 
---
Do not be surprised that after 6 months of Classic, half (or more) the BfA player base from August will play Classic as their main game.
---
Don't be surprised of the snowball effect of losing players. For months now, many BfA guilds have issues forming raids...after August 27th, MOST BfA guilds will probably disband, merge or fully move to Classic.
---
Make no mistake. Retail will still exist...but it will be dead. There will still be players...but they will have massive issue enjoying the game, due to lack of players.
---
This is going to snowball, quite fast.
---
Underestimating Classic "crack" effect is a big mistake. Retail players should better admit this, and prepare for. Because fighting against is going to be futile.
---
Haha yep i was in order of the ancients with recruiter, then we had a coup and unseated him and made eximos
---
The world buff meta from private servers won't exist for classic anyway. Private servers removed the cooldowns on turning in stuff for things like Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer, which in the real game was iirc a 6 hour CD.
---
Flame Sacks, Posion Sacks from Whelps and Insects sell well for Fire/Nature resist potions and gear.
---
Look up raid consumables and what it takes to make them. A lot of those items drop while you level.
---
I'm not complaining about OP, I'm stating that the horde in the comments are being dogs again.
---
Thumb up! Thanks for sharing
---
You kept the Zandalar buff though death, and it provided runspeed. It was the only one that was actually practical to get.
---
But otherwise, yeah, people almost never actually used them in Vanilla.

He just have to play a melee hunter duh!
---
That sure is quite a few fallacies in such a short amount of text, but you do you. I also enjoy the idea of recreating the pure vanilla experience, and usually that is by not making changes. However, the whole world buffs always on in raids is really a private server thing. "It was available in classic" doesn't really hold water when it was not a thing at all. The content is already going to be brain-dead easy.

This exactly
---
I honestly believe this is why blizzard didn't fix paladin tanking till TBC.
---
Depends on how much over the vendor price though. People forget about deposits and auction house cuts.
---
It would probably be easy to Port to other versions that still had old style trees.  I have the code for a 1.12.1 version of the addon that someone may be easily able to Port.  I don't know how difficult it would be since I don't know what, if any, the changes were in the necessary API calls between those versions.
---
Who are you to decide what's good or bad. People genuinely love like TBC and wrath, search for "what expansion was the best poll" and you will find most polls have lots of answers for wrath and TBC.

etc etc.
---
I wish there was a massive poll, if you find one please let me know. But clearly there's a demand, clearly people enjoy TBC and wrath and it's egoistic as hell to say our version is the best and the only that deserve recreation.
---
I'm glad u won't easily be able to do this (log an other faction alt) in real classic.  Not that this example is an example of it being abused, but it does get abused for sure.
---
Staysafe was there on stream.  I'm not sure but i think  he made it to the roof
---
Human warlock is pvp god for tbc arena. Rogues are op in every single early arena season so countering them is great.
---
The people complaining are not from retail Vanilla. They're from private servers.
---
South of shadowprey village there are centuars I think around lvl 33. There is loads and the area is never busy. Good alterinative to early lvl stv on busy servers.
---
I think work, spouse and kids are going to GREATLY affect the play style of many who think they will play anywhere close to they did in 2004-2006
---
I was a holy paladin actually, funny enough. 
---
We only has one fury warrior in the guild and he was a newer recruit. I was an officer with 100% attendance and pvped  often.
---
Our gm said since its too difficult to say who deserves item priority, we just rolled for it. 
---
He rolled first .... 56. Statistically likely to win. I was absolutely shaking trying to type /roll into the chat. I took a deep breath and pressed enter
---
78
---
Ive never cared about getting shit rolls on loot for the rest of my life, because on that day luck was on my side. 
---
Ill never forget after getting it, showing up to world pvp for the first time fighting over azuregos and seeing the reactions on the forums haha. Definitely cherished memories
---
That is true, but this was actually changed in patch 1.11, so hopefully on classic the buff will be removed on death. https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Spirit_of_Zandalar
---
 You mean /oom right?
---
You got that level 55 water right? 45 water at 60 suuuucks
---
PVE classic server is like playing diablo 2 on hardcore but alt-f4ing every time before you die.
---
It was a charged up ability, you would start running slow and increase in speed over a duration of a few seconds.  So if you wanted to remain at full speed you would have to keep running.  Lots of cows running in circles is what I remember.  hahaha
---
What world are these people living in?  They're going to be struggling with half the group being incompetent and taking 5 hours to get through MC, not doing speed run world firsts lol.
---
I believe if you type /mana (or it could be /oom, unsure), you're character will loudly exclaim "i need more mana" or "i'm out of mana!"
---
I agree. I’ll want to focus on PvE to start with then PvP during the lulls I’m content.  AV was fun for a bit, but the marathon games can get boring fast.
---
Warlock
---
That's awesome, saving this to launch
---
Argent dawn and alterac biscuits until then
---
This is similar to what I would want as well, there were many improvements in both TBC and WotLK but at the same time it killed many things as well.
---
Dungeon groups were easier to get but at the cost of community, viability of each spec were added but at the cost of diversification as all specs could do the same thing in different ways. Flying mounts were just plain bad as the world suddenly shrank and you basically never saw other players anymore.
---
We have a unique opportunity now to cherry pick the things that would be beneficial after having seen them play out already such as making for example retribution paladins viable as a DPS/off healer if it's done right and basically make WoW feel even more like WoW and not just turn into a cookie cutter BiS chase.
---
So far its been ok when they pull another group. It's when another another group comes along uninvited. 😥
---
I always had sap on triangle or diamond as a tank.

My brains might be broken but for some reason i recognize the icons when i see them but never really haven't thought how they really look and what the icon represents.

Is it beneficial to level Fishing and Cooking on alts?
---
Is leveling with Tailoring/Enchanting reaaaaaaaaaally going to slow me down? (Warlock, so at least the mount issue is mitigated)
---
Time of day.
---
Warlocks are good, rets and cast are not.
---
&gt; And then you sit in the raid doing way less damage then everyone else of your class just because you didn't pick up world buffs.
---
So, add a bit more effort to get that world buff then, dont whine because others arent as lazy.
---
#NoChanges
---
Gnome warrior.
---
Its just easier on the older version to sign up everything so people know what to keep an eye on.  Or moon is by tank, resheep.  Square is on me, reice trap.
---
Exactly! It's the same with HS cards.
---
&gt;private servers grossly overtune elite NPC damage. 
---
Source on this? I was under the impression pservers were actually tuned easier because the Parry rate of bosses was like 5% when it was supposed to be 14%? (https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/bug-hit-tables/185675/34)
---
Hunter why did you trap the guy that ran over your trap first which you had no control over. You were supposed to trap the caster in the back.
---
I'll be just as hardcore in Classic as I was in Wrath, but this time I'm a bit smarter and more organized.  
---
I'm looking forward to going full autist.
---
Not only melee leeway but also layering, 1.12 alterac valley have really made me think twicr about resubbing for classic
---
Yay i am not the only one then!!!!!
---
People arguing against this saying #NoChanges or invoking the slippery slope argument are being so incredibly disingenuous. World buffs were not used in raids in vanilla. Go ahead, post me the link of in 240p of nihilum using it once on a boss for a world first, it doesn't change anything.
---
The use of world buff stacking and going full neckbeard by logging off your character to preserve them is a private server invention. The fact that it was technically available on vanilla is pointless when it wasn't used ever. 
---
The argument for nochanges is to preserve the integrity of the classic wow experience. If you disagree, then make that argument to me. Preserving the classic wow experience would mean removing world buffs in raids. I was in vodka, we didn't use them. They interviewed DnT, they didn't use them. I assure you, far less renowned guilds also did not use them.
---
Ret/reckoning is a joke anyway.  And before people get hurt ask yourself this: why would you ever bring a ret instead of another DD? The most effective thing a ret can do is using his support spells ( since you dont really have anything agressive anyway). So dispel/ freedom / protection/sacrifice,etc. 
---
Freedom is almost always better on another class than it is on yourself. A rogue/warrior can use it to close the gap /interrupt/ slow the EFC/ healer - things to you cant really do with the paladin spell-kit.  And- depending on the situation - healing  (yes even as a ret) is better than doing damage. And at that point you might as well  be a holy paladin. 
---
This isn't even exclusive to paladins by the way. Try arguing for stuff like fire mage, combat rogues, fury warriors and you will face the same resentment.  All these specs bring damage, but just like ret that is mostly all they bring to the table. Meanwhile a frost mage or arms warrior do good enough damage anf have better utility.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
That is why I assume holy paladins. and how are you supposed to kill these as hunter? They simply outheal you until you give up or run out of ammo.
---
It's seriously tough.  I was an orc warrior back in the day. Most friends going horde, but I wanted to play alliance so I have access to paladins. 
---
'Tis tough.
---
There's really no point to have fish/cook on more than 1 character and I would recommend it being on the main since if you get 300 fishing you can use it to summon the fish boss in ZG. 
---
Tailoring enchanting definitely takes time which could go to leveling. I think the best solution is to get enchanting and just disenchant everything, remember that in vanilla you don't need enchanting skill to disenchant things, so DE all the quest items and send all the mats to a bank alt, so when you are 60 you can skill it up together with tailoring. I think waiting until 60 is the best move since at 60 there's a lot of waiting for dungeons.
---
Anything Metallica
---
You are asking for changes to a game which is supposed to be a recreation of the original game. Thats the whole idea behind Classic, like how fucking special do you have to be to not understand that?  
---
I didn't say you shouldn't play the game but obviously if you don't like the way things work then you should probably CONSIDER playing something else or do something else in the game.  
---
   
---
I have cleared everything in vanilla except Naxx. I know what it's like to gather world buffs and yes it takes time and sucks to lose them if you die, but that's just part of the game and not an excuse to remove them entirely. You are not forced to farm world buffs, nobody is holding a gun to your head, so whats the big deal? Why can others not enjoy world buffs if they want to?
---
Marksman is the only hunter spec.
---
Warrior for life.
---
People know the game better. They're going to use better gear, consumables, buffs, leveling routes, addons, tactics, computers, and even classes.
---
And all of that was possible in vanilla too.
---
Music in the old PVP videos was crap.
---
How much are you going to pvp is the real question.
---
My friends are all no lifers who are gonna grind hardcore on a PvP server.
---
Meanwhile Im probably rolling pve cause I'm gonna be very slow.
---
You list some pros and ignore all cons
---
If youre farming a dungeon it can make or break how many runs you can get in.  Saving 2-3 minutes ever few pulls adds up in larger dungeons.  Sunken temple for example.  I tanked in vanilla, i had this thing down to a science back that.  Knew the quickest route and when to pull.  Could tell how long some groups were going to be based on how quickly i was able to get patting mobs.  Some people just dont want to waste time is all.
---
Information.
---
But at least you're not a gnome.
---
It's nice for a lock since you save extra cash from the mount. If I were you I would put as much money as you can into tailoring first to get as far ahead as possible so you can make and sell shadow and frost weave + bags first.  You will make a killing.  Be first.
---
This is a very interesting tool! Thanks! :D
---
For single target (bosses) it's mostly the same, but when doing dungeons you will use instant spells and aoe spells a lot more it's kinda hard to say what your "rotation" is, it depends heavily on the pull which is what kinda makes dungeons fun to do.
---
Or a priest that did nothing but shield himself and kite mobs
---
Heavily considering rolling tauren warrior for tanking. Is orc considered better?
---
i dont feel like it does that much at best it reflects one frostbolt
---
&gt; makes most retail player clear the content in the first 4-5 weeks
---
4 weeks into BoD around 30 guilds had killed mythic Jaina. 
---
People don't quit because they "finished the game", they just don't like the game enough to put a lot of time into it, or at least not the progression system as it is. 
---
&gt;Now, with Classic...they won't have to unsunb. They WILL play Classic. And Classic have a very powerful addiction effect.
---
I don't think so. I think the initial launch will last for a pretty long time, considering how long it takes to level and stuff. But I really don't see end game having a much higher retention rate than modern WoW. And especially classic patches will not cause players to come back for very long, if they had previously left. 
---
I think a lot of players will loose interest pretty quickly after clearing the raids. Unless you're really into PvP or stuff like that, there's not that much to do except log on for raids.
---
Ayle is a treasure
---
You can like vanilla, and despise one of the thing in there. It's not mutually exclusive. And you can't play something else, because there's nothing like it/as good as it.
---
I'm too much of a fashion slave to play gnome.
---
The whole atmosphere of the game is very different, when ppl aren't just playing AVs for fun, but everyone is farming honor and rep.
---
Ppl act differently and everything is different really.
---
Ofc playing AV for hours with no purpose and just hanging around is a special kind of fun, if its fun at all. It super fun and engaging when you are farming shit, but once you get your rep and honor cap for the week, you lose all intrest.
---
Also usually AVs are only heavily played on AV weekends which is only couple of days per month. So its hype, and ppl try to juice everything out of it.
---
In warsong they are almost always the flag carrier. This means stealthing to the enemy base, taking the flag and running like a mofo, switching in and out of bear stance, cat form, and travel form to remove slows and use the abilities in there. 
---
In Arathi basin you are mostly a healer, sometimes you go with the rogue to cap smth, sometimes you stand on flag and spamclick it so people have to attack you, it depends a lot.
---
In AV you either tank or heal, your choice.
---
Glowfx was added with Dire Maul, iirc, and was way more intense when added than in 1.12.
---
It's baffling to me that so many people seem to remember the game as not glowy. I can only guess that either they turned it off right away when it was first added because it was too intense and then forgot about it, or they played Vanilla on potato computers that couldn't enable it.
---
I also don't get how private server players think it looks wrong. Does the zip of the 1.12 install everyone uses have it turned off by default? Maybe the 1.12 client turns it off because it can't properly detect modern video cards?
---
Troll is better for pve and ele spec, orc for pvp
---
Warlocks do the lords work by just shadowbolt spamming. The only reason say warlocks are outclassed is they don't have innate threat reduction. So they have to throttle a lot vs other classes. But if done properly and you have good enough tanks Locks can pump a ton of damage. Especially on multi target fights just roll all your dots out and enjoy the free padding of meters.
---
I mean if you were on the fence just because of those things - then yeah would you spend hundreds of hours leveling and gearing if you are going to hate playing the game.
---
Just out of curiosity why are people like yourselves so adamant about post Nax content/changes. Why don't you just focus your efforts on changing retail to adapt more of classics philosophies. A lot of the things you posted here are what retail offers you: hybrid balance, fast flight paths, re-worked talent trees. 
---
I'm not trying to be an ass, but shit like this gets posted everyday and it gets downvoted the same everyday people are kind of tired of seeing it its so tedious at this point.
---
Also I noticed 90% of the time people post these threads its on a throwaway since they already know its an unpopular opinion.
---
https://youtu.be/CD-E-LDc384
---
I agree, but do you ever get that thing where you say a word over and over and the more you say it the weirder it starts to sound?
---
That's me, but endlessly playing around with leveling specs.
---
Here, help me out. 
---
I wanna be in demand for groups and raids. I'm thinking warrior or druid tank, or maybe warlock/shaman. I feel like this go around there are gonna be a lot of locks and shamans. But never will there be enough tanks.
---
Living action potion. Breaks stun.
---
The JUICE!
---
I’d advise you to play a melee hunter without a pet (because pet are lame, it’s not Pokemon here!)
---
 Pick a cool name like ´DarkLegolas¥69’ and play on RP-PvP but without role playing because it’s lame. (don’t forget to remind everyone of that on global channel)
---
For talent, during leveling, don’t spend any because you get double points if you reach lvl60 without (not many people know that) when you are max level, drop everything in one tree because only virgins don’t know what they want and put points everywhere.
---
Concerning your raid, be the one to link DPS-meter and put yourself in the top 5 (but not first, you want to keep low profile) if somebody link their own, pretend it’s the special character in your name who mess the result.
---
Of course roll need on everything (class tradition) and threaten to report anyone complaining before they do and don’t forget to feign death every single fight because repairs are expensive and finally be sure to not buy any skills that doesn’t deal damage (because again it’s expensive)
---
Level 10 cooking is needed to pick up the strider meat quest in dark shore, but so far as I know that is the only such cooking quest that requires cooking.  There is a similar quest to fish up 3 of a specific fish in dsrkshore, but I skip that one.
---
I don't play alliance but if I did make a warlock it would be a gnome.
---
You sound like someone hurt you.
---
If this happens more than a few times I'm leaving that  group and smacking that hearthstone.
---
Oh shit
---
That may be the most efficient solution but it doesn't appeal to me at all. I want crafting profs to play with as I level and it's part of the core experience for me, whereas I have no idea how max level will go. I was thinking of just going Herbalism/Alchemy instead.
---
I just never leveled Tailoring/Enchanting so idk how bad it actually is. Like, if it's somewhat slower but not fatal I'd take it, if it makes leveling take 6 months instead of 3 that's a no go. It also sounded like Enchanting is not particularly wanted, I'm not sure.
---
In your head, I assume you believe you are making sense.
---
I don't have an issue with people having less ping. Forcing people to have more ping in vanilla to try and recreate would be dumb. That would only serve to hurt the experience.
---
Here is the key difference. World buffs were not used in raiding in vanilla. This is a pure private server invention because you've had a decade to find out just how much you can break unintended design. It requires you to logout and specifically not play to do. This is incredibly harmful to the vanilla experience, and ultimately that is what is most important here.
---
100% this. For example, leveling a priest without Spirit Tap would be such an abysmal experience. It's one of the only things that makes priest leveling bearable. 
---
Of course people have leveled and will level without it, but it makes the experience so tedious.
---
No, you would come out as soon as you started channeling eyes of the beast.
---
Gaming isn't the same as it was 15 years ago :)
---
Poggers.
---
I am talking about when it died. Which was Cata era.
---
&gt; It's probably not going to feel very nice for Mages to do 25% less DPS than fury warriors in BWL, but that's the imbalance of Vanilla.
---
Yeah, but that's a class difference, you can't do anything about it. But if you as a fury warrior do 25% less damage than the other fury warriors in your raid just because you didn't bother to pick up world buffs, that can cause some problems.
---
Disturbed- Down with the sickness.
---
Mine also... I will play alone. That means I will probably roll a hunter to have a pet with me... or Lock. tbh I checked hunter on a private server and it seems that lvling as a hunter is just facerolling on Your keyboard. Seems the same with a lock with Voidwalker. I just cant decide... I would like to play a healer maybe this time... Because I never played one... Also Alliance or Horde... All my life I played horde. I don't know anything about alliance, maybe thats a good thing... Maybe this will allow me to enjoy the game like the first time if I roll alliance. but what class... I tend to play PvP more... Maybe a warrior gnome... I always thought it would be a good idea with Escape Artist meing great and all...
---
Were you around last month when we had threads every day about how the content felt _wayyyy_ too easy? [Blizzard even had to publicly state the damage values were correct since people felt it was much lower than it should be](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/elite-npc-damage-is-way-off-plausible-evidence/178518/77).
---
The parry thing mainly affects threat generation of tanks. It does affect how much damage the group will be able to output, but not really the incoming damage.
---
No warrior is going to be crit immune. If you are running that much defense you wont be able to have enough hit for yellow hit cap so your threat will be booty cheddar. Half the time a tank unless they are human wont have increased weapon skill because once you get thunderfury you wont have anything unless dwing maladath you wont have over 300 weapon skill anyways. So i mean i didnt mention those things because they are irrelevant and when a druid takes a crit it doesn't really phase them that much. Because they have so much damage reduction because of how much armor they have. it goes from a 3k hit to a 4.5k hit. on 10k hp target. That really isn't that big of a deal.
---
Plz stop
---
Mages are bad mmm k
---
I don't want to live on this planet anymore.
---
Not a talent, but the old icon for Serpent Flesh looked like a dick.
---
BRE on AoE fights and Deathbringer beg to differ.
---
There is no reason to believe that they won't become a requirement, even for casual guilds, as is seen in the private server community. 
---
You are arguing against your own interests, since allowing them is actually going to hurt the classic wow experience that everyone wants to recreate.
---
The only difference between now and Vanilla are server side checks to detect speed hacks, teleport hacks, and if your character is under the world geometry. The basic movement and collision detection are still purely client side.
---
It's actually not that hard while leveling up. I'm playing an arms warrior and tanking dungeons just fine. When you hit 60 there will really only be 1 viable spec for raising. The problem will be if you want to raid and do PvP at which point it almost makes more sense to just get another toon to 60.
---
Well i didn't before but now when i tried that couple of times it really makes at least short words sound weird and stupid. Excellent.
---
I imagine for warlocks single target would be a lot different in dungeons because you don’t have to worry about the debuff limit. So you would be putting up corruption and siphon life if youre affliction.
---
All top guilds used world buffs. Even my guild used world buffs in BWL.
---
Is the max rank mage water only level 45?
---
Just rallying cry. Everything else is exactly the same and will be the meta.
---
Fused wiring. Never vendor that shit you need it for repair bots and is generally worth a pretty penny.
---
&gt; emulating the server code
---
No, they are not emulating server code, they are running written from scratch server code on bare metal...
---
Can the faction bosses be summoned in AV 1.12?
---
http://i.imgur.com/FMvrAoN.jpg
---
Wasn't released until TBC, my bad.
---
To each their own!
---
You are singling out something that was in vanilla, because _you_ didn't use it.
---
You are free to still not use them, if that's what you want, but they absolutely were in vanilla, whether popularized at a later date or not.
---
It’s not a small change by any means. You need to get miss chance to 0%. As a non-Orc you need three more items with 1% hit and that is a big problem.
---
Do yourself a favor and trust experienced people when they say *this is big* and not just min/max. I don’t get why you feel the need to argue about this without knowing what you are talking about.
---
I get 3% sounds like a small change, but the difference in output is greater than 3%.
---
It's all pretty simple,  frost bolt and aoe  Haha
---
No but mages get the highest water at lvl 58 or something so they only craft 4(maybe 2?) per spell. Depending on how much they liked you they would either give you a stack of 45 of cast a bunch of 55 and give it to you.
---
^this. please do not level as resto theres absolutely no point youll just be gimping yourself. just go enh or ele if you really feel like it and keep a healing set and youll be able to heal any group. no healer is resto specced for leveling dungeons
---
Since most things are account bound in Retail now, it's become less and less about your character and more about what you achieved on your account.     
---
That's one thing I'm really excited for Classic. I can play a character again, not just me playing a video game to the next achievement.
---
Microsoft couldn't figure out mobile, funny how software works eh
---
&gt; However, the whole world buffs always on in raids is really a private server thing. "It was available in classic" doesn't really hold water when it was not a thing at all.
---
Maybe you didn't care enough to use world buffs in Vanilla, but [the world first KT kill had world buffs.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CNN_Cn2L2A)
---
World buffs were always there and available to use, but very few people cared enough to take the time to use them.  Now that there will be raid logs and speed runs and such, people are wishing that they'd never been there in the first place, and I understand that.  But they were there in Vanilla, and the try-hardest of people used them, and it would be an unnecessary balance change to alter them.
---
Druids are great great healers because they are so mobile and hard to kill
---
Contested how? No pally on horde, so the only competition is another warrior.
---
This is why i as a healer usually run to where the next pack or fight will be and start drinking the moment i get out of combat. Then again, im the priest that makes mages be the ones to beg for mana breaks if the tank wont pull fast enough.
---
The instant gratification of retail WoW is not sustainable compared to classic WoW's gratification system. I'm willing to bet the main reason casuals won't make the swap is because they "already have so much time invested into their accounts, and all that progress will mean nothing"
---
The exact same thing happened with OSRS and RS3. Some people swapped right away and realized the old game was better, while others swapped after 4-5 years (people are still making the switch to this day). Obviously not everyone will switch, some will still prefer retail, but I can actually see Classic being the more popular of the 2, at least until it gets to the end of its content cycle (Naxx). The next expansion for retail will certainly shift the numbers, but that's the nice thing about a shared sub, both games will benefit.
---
But MUH METERS!
---
It's a spell and costs about 70% of normal
---
wat
---
&gt; Or your idiot raid leader decides that you totally need those world buffs for this boss kill and have everyone go get them, what are you going to do?
---
I'm the GM of my guild so I doubt that will happen and we have already voted against world buffs and consumables that are too time consuming to farm. The total time farming for and clearing raids will be lower overall, plus our members get to decide what they want to do on off days.
---
I will play a paladin so luckily my 40 mount is free :)
---
It's just writing scripts, you don't need a programming background. You need to understand what methods are and maybe basic if/else control structures but that's it, if you are willing to put in the effort to read up on it and try you can probably do basic stuff fast.
---
"You spank it, you tank it!"
---
He is using hyperbole to get a very important message across. While its not an exploit, its not a change to vanilla in reality(since nobody used them), its a change to private server meta.
---
That would suck on STV, back to level 1.
---
Priest, Mage and Warlock trainers stand right next to Shadow Priest Sarvis. And then he gives you a Scroll *from them* which says to go and visit them... even as they're standing right there.
---
That doesn't make any fucking sense. So go for Warrior or Rogue, at least these trainers are in the building on the other side of the street.
---
PVE is a completely different game to PVP.  To imagine otherwise is to vastly underestimate the level of restriction put on pve server players in contested zones compared to pvp.
---
For example on PVE servers what do you do when you get to level 30ish?  Go straight to STV and do those nice nessingwary quests for awesome xp.  STV is probably the best zone for questing, there's just so many quests available and for a long time.
---
On a PVP server, going to STV at 30 is a death sentence.  You never do it, you'd be killed 3-4 times per quest or more and never get anything productive done.  No you must level to 36 or 38 elsewhere via alternative routes/means until you have some more survivability.  This forces you to react and perhaps do things that are sub optimal to bypass areas/quests/zones which have high chance of ganking.
---
What about shimmering flats.  Great place to go and quest at level 30-32 for horde and alliance.  On a pvp server I've had some insane fun with spontaneous pvp where horde is rolling around in 2s and 3s killing alliance soloers so the soloers get together and make a 5man and go spend 30 mins rolling the horde back and then it escalates further etc.  So much fun.  This would never happen on a PVE server.
---
There's a reason they don't allow you to transfer level 60 characters from pve servers to pvp servers.  Getting to 60 on a pvp server is a completely different, and far more fun and dangerous, experience.  
---
PVE servers are like playing an single player campaign game with cheats on.  Sure you get to experience the same game, the same story, but the satisfaction from achieving something within the game is hollow for the player with cheats compared to the player who earned it.
---
mages can make 55 but vendors only sell 45.
---
Cats it was huge though
---
&gt; 4 weeks into BoD around 30 guilds had killed mythic Jaina. 
---
I am sorry, but which part of my "most retail players" you didn't understood? You do KNOW that most retail players DO NOT raid mythic , right ?
---
As for you not agreeing that Classic  have a very powerful addiction effect...well, that is your (and most retail players opinion) and I am putting up with that since November 2017.
---
And I will keep putting up with that until August 27th. And a while after that, like 2-3 months.
---
But before December 2019, everyone will see the effects of Classic addiction.
---
So, keep not agreeing with me for as long as you can...it's your opinion, and it's fine. Just don't be surprised when half of your guild is not logging in BfA anymore, and they are playing Classic.
---
Cant use in combat
---
I gotta say, playing in Classic Beta with the voice comms helped a lot. It seems like telling someone in voice that you're almost oom has a stronger effect. Or the people in the beta are just better players generally.
---
Dark rune is a good way to lower your health to increase the beserking buff.. also the mana gained is nice
---
In world pvp as a hunter I feel like I used to wreck mages. But they must’ve not been great, because I probably wasn’t very good either lol
---
Can Devilsaurs be killed solo at fresh level 60... debating if skinning is worth taking to 300 as fury warrior for the Devilsaurs gear
---
That's the most arrogant thing I've read in a while.
---
"In 15 years no one else has been able to make this work, but I bet I can do it!"
---
Are you honestly suggesting this is their attitude?
---
I used to play with this great warrior and mage back in vanilla. Huge pulls by the standard at the time, the dps would be running out of mana before I would. He was a good leader and didn’t require any communication in regards to what pace to pull at. We normally had stellar dps though and that made a huge difference. I remember solo healing a ZG run near the end of vanilla. 
---
Warrior’s name was Nerd of Mal’ganis. I hope he’s doing well in life.
---
Well they started to do that and the game got even worse
---
Inspired by the recent meme from u/qwasd0r
---
Dude, i'm torn also. I played warrior and mage, and like the idea of playing my old builds, but at the same time i want to play a dwarf priest for fear ward and juicy mind control kills in BRM(Would like to repay the favor of all the times it happened to me as a kid lol). I only have time for one character, though... Choices choices.
---
No one would expect you to be resto to heal while leveling and you won't need if to be capable.  I would only level resto if you had a 5man group dedicated to dungeon grind to 60.
---
I generally would not take healing grace, you are unlikely to rip threat on things actively being tanked.  Usually you get healer aggro on unranked adds, but if th ey are untanked 15% is no difference.  Also as resto you can get pushback resistance and a shield so you are semi viable offtank.
---
Hey, 10% intellect bonus. What can you do
---
You can spend the time until launch trying different classes on private realms.
---
I enjoyed many things in both TBC and WotLK but at the same time there were many things that changed the game in way that has now snowballed out of control.
---
It's very easy to say it some things were straight up "bad", increasing the ilvl in each expansion by a disproportional amount made most gear acquired pre-expansion useless. This, coupled with the abundance of new gear for almost every quest and the many and more easily acquired drops from dungeons made gear upgrades much less significant. 
---
Of course you can argue that this is a good thing but to my knowledge one of the many reasons people wanting to play Classic are doing so because they found this abundance of loot and the overall simplification of the game to be bad. 
---
Again, I am not saying that any particular iteration of WoW is better or worse than any other, what I **am** saying is that **some parts are** **better or worse.**   
---
**This** is the entire point of the post to begin with, to find out what people enjoyed the most, why they enjoyed it and if it would be advantageous to add in WoW Classic.
---
I was not! Thanks for that link, very interesting read.
---
You don’t need to ask healer ready every pull. Which is what you’d being doing since in vanilla and bc you mark basically every pull, even if you’re not using cc.
---
On alliance it is human only for me. 
---
But on Horde....i played much orc warrior and warlock in later expansions, never touched tauren but had a troll warrior time back in wotlk.
---
Imo the perfect game would be Classic with Wotlk talent tree/skills/combat
---
God damn dps need to learn to focus fire one mob down at a time.
---
Yes it's very weird. It's like buying something you wouldn't have bought otherwise just because it's on sale and thinking you're saving money. 
---
If people want to spend more time overall related to raiding they should be able to. It's a very inefficient use of everyone's time, it can lead to burnout and it takes the fun out of the game but if you want to you should be allowed to.
---
Personally I'm looking forward to raiding on wednesdays and thursdays if needed which is plenty to clear all the content without world buffs. The rest of the week we can fuck around doing whatever.
---
Too close to home
---
[The songs from this video are pretty suitable , they have already become part of the story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfjtk2VEb_M)
---
99.99% of the player base didn't world buff staff, including guilds like Death and Taxes. Private servers have brought the meta forward because of no cooldowns on dragon head turn ins. Even with cooldowns being on live, the meta will creep its way in. To act like keeping world buff stacking is being loyal to #nochanges is a bit delusional, no one did it in retail vanilla
---
they must have changed the 100% durabily loss too, shame.
---
Oopsie
---
Dillion Harper ofc
---
World Buffs seem kind of eh anyway unless you're going for "cutting edge" (as much as it can be for old content). If you spend an hour getting buffs to save 45 minutes in a Raid you've only played yourself as long as you can clear the bosses anyway. 
---
If you want to go hard for logs/meter/speedruns go nuts, though. Do what you gotta.
---
Cool, argue against your own experience because #Nochanges autism. Can't wait to not play the game because we are #PreservingBuffTimers living our best #VanillaExperience. jfc this sub is dumb sometimes
---
Macro no, addon should be able to.  I know there are addon that /party other info like the results of a purge.
---
That too, though these dots really aren't that much of a dps increase for most things if I recall correctly.
---
Wrong. warchiefs blessing for example has an even bigger cd. i believe it was around 12 hours or so?
---
how is multishot just gonna give me a 3 sided nelf sword
---
talk about laziness design
---
Very mature, calling "autism" whenever someone calls you out on your bull. You'll go far in life I'm sure.
---
Excellent. Excellent. Excccellent. Exxxxcellent. ExCELLent...
---
What's the relevancy to my post?
---
&gt; to my knowledge one of the many reasons people wanting to play Classic are doing so because they found this abundance of loot and the overall simplification of the game to be bad.
---
Who says they neccesarily have to be the same players?
---
&gt; There is no reason to believe that they won't become a requirement, even for casual guilds
---
They won't be in my guild since we all agree that it's a massive waste of time. If you don't want to use world buffs and extreme consumables just find a guild that's in line with your own views, it's always been like that.
---
Lmao
---
Roll shaman! You won’t regret it.
---
I agree. Let's preserve this thing that was not a thing in vanilla because the private server crowd is super into it. Can't wait to not play the game because I have timers running.
---
Oh god......
---
There's no way a dead chick with bones sticking out will be sexy. So you might as well make a male abomination.
---
Even on trash mobs you’ll only put up corruption and spam shadowbolt. Single target dps is the way to go. Always attack the tanks target.
---
I was thinking of going gnome warlock for the better ally racials, but then realized that I absolutely hate the way gnomes look, so I would probably stop playing it after a while. Now I'm thinking of human warlock or something else.
---
&gt; Might be completely wrong on that but on live you don't see people popping runes on farm 
---
I dunno, I see at least augment runes used when people try to parse. 
---
&gt;I doubt players will go to that effort in every day farm.
---
Depends on you mentality. If you're only there to get loot, then yeah, why bother (except if the other raiders think you're slacking because of it). But if you like to make farm runs more interesting by trying to parse well and so on, then it will definitely be a thing.
---
Yes,  mostly by hunters
---
This is a perfect example. Didn't make any sense.
---
I don't think anyone here is interested in thanking sociopaths like Alex.
---
Tauren resto shaman, where the hood attt
---
I know i will not be able to decide. I just accepted the fact that i wont ever be 100% satisfied with whatever i play.
---
I get your argument, but considering the amount of downtime WoW has running from one place to another or just eating/drinking... you look a whole lot at your character.
---
It's easy man, you go BM and have a really fast pet speed. Also the moment you slip, just cast your aspect of cheetah and run opposite way with pet attacking
---
Gnomes just look horrible. No endgame gear looks good on them. Damn I wish dwarfs could play warlock in classic.
---
They're a reward for guilds having cleared the content already. It's makes reclearing easier but I people keep forgetting the 24h cooldown on world buffs. It's not as if every guild can buff themselves whenever they like
---
Hunters dont even get the attack power from buffs, since its "meele atkpower".
---
Lol what a dunce.
---
You dont get in to combat when they pull.  
---
You get in to combat if you cast anything.  
---
I used it so many times in vanilla back in the day.
---
As long as your 20’ from anyone when they die and you havent casted anything you could enter shadowmeld and save it.
---
more importantly: no paladin
---
You still play D3? :O  
---
I was thinking you could have leaderboards for arena for example. Only vanity items as a reward like a mount, only accessable by a few people and ideally changing each season.
---
It was a thing in vanilla, whether you used it or not.
---
We've been over this already, and you already lost control over it due to your inability to provide any form of arugment other than "I didn't know about it". Are we really doing this again?
---
Nope what?
---
That sounds like fun. When you say put money into it, do you mean actually buy the relevant materials (linen, wool, etc.)? And would you prioritize it over First Aid?
---
I really hope they consider atleast one month of no world buffs when new content is released.

I would want to see something like that for Classic

But shadow boi

Totally agree with you! I was a hardcore raiders and got to rank 12 in vanilla. I had no wife/kids and Job was just getting interesting. 
---
Now I have a demanding job, wife, kids (7&amp;5yrs old), so will be limited to playing after kids are in bed, roughly 8pm onwards. 
---
I hope to get to 60 in approx 2 mths. Where I’ll be raiding 1-2 times a week max. Will prob level another character / alt in between raiding, but will not be going hardcore at all.
---
In vanilla I had a main who was raiding Naxx (only 3-4 boss killed though), was in full T2.5 and good pvp epics. This time I will be playing casually and having fun. If I get gold gear, then great, same with PvP, rank 10 is achievable, but without major time sink as 12-15yrs ago was! 
---
Still can’t wait to get back into it.
---
&gt; Yeah, but that's a class difference, you can't do anything about it. But if you as a fury warrior do 25% less damage than the other fury warriors in your raid just because you didn't bother to pick up world buffs, that can cause some problems.
---
Not necessarily. The threat cap in vanilla will be much lower than what people are used to on private servers so buffing yourself to the teeth will just cause you to steal aggro if you use any of your abilities.
---
Everyone can play however they want, but to this I have to just wonder 'why'. If the dps rank you so desperately crave is so dependent on all these factors, why do you really care? Why is the goal not more of the intended game philosophy of accomplishing a greater goal as a collective, but instead so hyper focused on epeed measuring? There are 1,000,000 things you can do in this life to feel good about your personal level of achievement, why sacrifice so much fun/enjoyment just to try to get it from a wow raid?
---
Don’t download it then
---
If we are going with a sign of the times I nominate Thrice
---
&gt; You can like vanilla, and despise one of the things in there.
---
Sure, but what this guy and other people don't seem understand is that these things will never change and are not supposed to change. Like the sole purpose of Classic is to recreate the original game but apparently thats very hard for some people to understand, and accept that other people want it that way.  
---
The thing is that this moron come here and calls others for neckbeards, retards and whatnot because they don't want the game the way that he wants it. So all i'm saying is, if its such a big problem for him or anyone else, then maybe he/they should consider playing another game or at least do something else in the game.
---
Why?  There are tauren rogue npcs (grimtotem).
---
I don't really give a fuck about retail but i'd probably go back and play a grimtotem allied race rogue if it ever became a thing.
---
They got a guide over an hour long about bag space. That should say something lol
---
I'm pretty fucking sure you're trolling, or maybe you forgot that you wrote the words, "graphics" and "no changes".
---
Either way, I'm out. I just dropped some deets since it was 100% relevant, and I'm getting flack for it? Fuck off. LOL
---
For frost single target, get close to the trash and cone on frostbite procs, assuming imp coc and frostbite.
---
For cleave same as single target just now worth it to nova coc.
---
For aoe, 2 ways: safe aoe is blizzard kiting, requires imp blizzard and permafrost.
---
  Dangerous but higher dps, is let a tank gather, flamestrike-&gt;nova-&gt;coc-&gt;arcane explosion while kiting with coc debuff, requires permafrost.
---
So it doesn’t work?
---
I had the opposite experience with Soda. He used to be ok but nowadays he is overly toxic. He is most likely just exaggerating to spice up his stream but to be honest its really annoying. I guess most people enjoy it though, to each their own.
---
Instead of having the leveling progression goal driven..
---
"Alright guys we are hitting lvl 45 by the end of the month.!!! "
---
It is.
---
"Hey stop leveling we need to wait for Karen, she is crunching at work and needs will be back in two weeks, but her in laws are in town so I dont know when she will start leveling again or for how long we have to wait".
---
&gt;something ironic about that.
---
Let me answer why.
---
Raid time is special. You have a very limited amount of it, because you need 40 people online at the same time, preferably the same 40-45. Spending some extra time outside of the raid, so that the raid time is efficient makes perfect sense, and farming AQ40, AQ20, ZG, MC, BWL in one week would be very difficult if that time isn't spend efficient
---
immune to bleeds, poisons, can break out of blind.  Pretty sexy.
---
Congrats on the wife and kids!
---
I hope to be in the same boat as far as raiding goes - consistently clearing raids and seeing gear actually be upgrades for people will be great.
---
Idk about classic but in retail i could never play a warlock because a lot of their icons to me dont fit the abilities and i couldnt associate anything
---
BFA mentality at it's worst.
---
Imagine having a Hard time playing a hunter 😂😂
---
it was only spirit res, not run-back res.
---
I'm 100% playing Paladin i we end up going Alliance, but im not sure what i wanna go as a Horde. Healer for sure, anyone in the same boat aas me that have any suggestion?
---
only spirit res
---
Now I understand why you are fighting for this, you have no idea what you are talking about.
---
15-20 minutes to get them? Totally wrong. On a Pserver maybe, but the timers to turn in heads are not going to be like that on classic. You will have to logoff once you are are fortunate enough to randomly get the buff. This is what you are arguing for.
---
That's what I came to say XD
---
In 2005/2006 I helped an ally mage do his quest at tabethas hut. He and his friend deleted their ally characters and created new horde (pvp server), leveled them up and raided with us.
---
It really depends. There was this Undead mage that I was fighting in Duskwood/Redridge for a few hours for 2 days in a row. 
---
If it was a fair fight at full health and we squared up, it was maybe 70/30 split, his lead. 
---
But if I got the drop on him, he was definitely done for because I'm Beast Mastery and even with blink my pet is too fast and just whittles him down eventualy. 
---
However if it was he who had the drop on me, there was just nothing I could do. He would Frost Nova, stick both me and pet, and just wreck me without me ever getting off as much as a Serpent Sting.
---
Which one?
---
This is the best answer. You may wind up using it till early raiding until you grab a Sorcerous Dagger from MC if you get super unlucky with  witchblade or focal sword.
---
How did TBC kill world PVP?   
---
Heck Haala alone was an insane place to be and it was constantly having fights there.
---
I've tried that but he blinks on me and dazed me every time lol.
---
Sounds like you'd need an addon for that
---
&gt;Decay is 5g a month down to a minimum of 10g.
---
Wow, I must have completely forgotten about respec cost decay. Do you have to not respec for a month in order to benefit? Or does it decay regardless?
---
yeah but it started to die after the s9 fiasco. There were a lot of known faces that started to stop because of it &amp; bad decisions by blizzard.
---
&gt;I am sorry, but which part of my "most retail players" you didn't understood? You do KNOW that most retail players DO NOT raid mythic , right ?
---
Then what do you mean with:
---
&gt; makes most retail players clear the content in the first 4-5 weeks
---
Apparently most players don't even try to clear content. 
---
That was my main point. It's not about patch design or fast pace or whatever. People just don't like the game enough to even bother doing all of it. 
---
&gt;As for you not agreeing that Classic have a very powerful addiction effect
---
Of course it does. But not endlessly. I mostly speak from my own experience here, and some from what I've seen from other players. But when I've been playing on private servers I do get bored with the game after a while. And there's a reason the *fresh* meme is a thing on pservers. 
---
&gt;But before December 2019, everyone will see the effects of Classic addiction.
---
Yeah, and by January 2020 a lot of people will go play other games instead, because they got bored of classic. 
---
&gt;Just don't be surprised when half of your guild is not logging in BfA anymore, and they are playing Classic.
---
We are already planning what we are going to do in classic, lol.
---
Why in tbc? Did their racials get better?
---
I’m really conflicted...I really want to roll undead lock, but hate dealing with the threat issues (rolled one through bwl on a private server). Pally buff sounds tempting.
---
Yes please keep us posted OP. European living in SEA here. I am assuming that Taiwan is the only region where I will get decent ping. But I also don't speak any Chinese, especially not the traditional Chinese favoured by Taiwanese. 
---
Maybe we could coordinate and form a guild or something if there is more interest from other English speakers.
---
Maybe you haven't realized that the OP image is not actual ingame graphics but irl. So get your stupid corrections back to r/woosh
---
Yeah that's what I don't understand. How is it a reward getting a raid on farm and then having to spend hours preparing for the raid by farming consumables and world buffs just to shave an hour off raiding hours. 
---
Getting a raid on farm should be the time to relax, not do more work and spend more time than you did before.
---
Then you must love wiping in classic.
---
I recommend getting an old monitor instead to make everything perfectly authentic.
---
I haven't seen any kind of constructive post in what **could** be a way, or one of many ways, forward post Naxx but I only started looking at this reddit once I heard the release date had been set. I don't know the history of this forum so if you can set me off to a similar more populated thread please do so. 
---
I will probably not get to experience Naxx this time either and that's OK for me, I never even set foot in AQ40 and that's also fine. I just really like Vanilla WoW but after trying to level a character to 10 in order to make a post on the Blizzard forums I just.. couldn't. I haven't played since Cata and even that was only for one month, it just seems much easier to get it right from the start than trying to fix whatever retail now is.
---
If people want their WoW experience to be about farming mounts in retail then ok, that's their preference and I won't try to change that. WoW Classic is back to basics with a game where all the learnings from the previous expansions are readily available and the aspirations and visions the original devs had for WoW actually have a chance to be realized. And I wouldn't mind playing Classic WoW forever :)
---
I don;'t really see that being a huge issue - it's only spirit rezzing.  It would just mean that basically no one ever used spirit rezzing unless they were already 60.
---
I played a game back in the day called Dark age of Camelot that had far worse xp penalties for dying.  But there were a few things that stop it being really bad, for example you could never de-level (which was the same with the blizzard version).  And also, at least in the DAOC one - if you went back to your corpse then the xp loss was less than if you rezzed back in town.  As far as I'm aware the blizz version was simply an xp penalty on using spirit healers, normal rezzing by a teammate or running back to your corpse did not cause xp loss.
---
The buffs aren't random. At all. Guilds choose when to pop them by saving the quests, usually ca 5 minutes before raid time.
---
Really, good job, you played yourself. You're arguing very, very hard against something you literally don't even understand lmao.
---
Fresh 60 as fury? I’m gonna say no
---
But if you just take 1 guildie or whatever with you can farm the whole zone and split the funds / send the excess to guild
---
Could you even make a vanilla PvP video without "Bodies"? It was like the hallmark of bad vanilla PvP videos for the drop to hit the moment the level 60 rogue cheap shotted a level 48 in Arathi Highlands.
---
Depends of you want to do, Paladins are kings of Buffs and single healing, Shamans are kings of Aoe healing and Windfury buffs, Druids are hots kings and they have Brez and Innervate, Priest are versite because they have accsess to every form of healing, i love healing as a priest but that depends of you
---
I love this whole concept! Amazing.
---
Now, one can only hope this will be a thing. (:
---
Back then you didn’t think about after 60, what role you could play or not. Remember playing Druid, got into a guild as feral, like I lvled ,and didn’t even know what stats I needed. Then joined another guild and had to respec resto. Didn’t plan on anything besides what class that looked and sounded cool.
---
That’s one of the things that we sadly never get back. Was a true joy to learn every little “stupid” thing.
---
Still I can’t wait to get back, I too can’t make up my mind about what to play. 🙄
---
Suggest the counterpart Horde-only class: Shaman.  Unique toolset, more offensive-minded than a paladin, but is still important as a healer.
---
Keep us updated OP! Living in SEA we are in an even worse situation as I don't think we can get decent pings to OCE nor US west.
---
i mean they basically recycled the idea for worgens.
---
Oooooooooo!!!! We’re going home!
---
It’s amazing not because you were meant to play 9 hours of straight AV but because you could play for an hour before raid and then resume the same AV after the raid.
---
Just rub it in a bit more that you have beta.
---
Watched the entire video... it changed my mind. I agree it should be one of the precious few changes.
---
Deadbolt
---
One frostbolt is/can be alot in vanilla
---
The health from Tauren is marginal, war stomp could be nice in dungeons, but orcs get axe weapon skill, stun resist, and an attack power (threat) cooldown.
---
As much as I'd like to explain why you're an idiot and that it's a simple informative post and has nothing to do with the OP or anything even close to a "correction"... I don't think it would get through your thick skull, so good luck not burning your hand on hot stoves and whatever else you obviously must struggle with in life. Wow.
---
Yeah, I leveled enchanting after a few months at 60, once I had income rolling and could comfortably drop skinning. I farmed rep heavily so it was convenient to the guild to have another enchanter available with the big rep recipes.
---
This. You can't compare gamers today with gamers back in 2004/5. Even those who already played games back then have likely changed their mentality by now. And don't even get me started on all the popular (irl) kids who're considered to be gamers today. Back in 2004/5 I was such a massive nerd that nobody wanted to hang out with, except for the other gamers. Now gaming has become a mainstream phenomenon that even the cool kids, who used to bully guys like me for playing video games, are playing all day and it's perfectly normal. Times have changed, and so will the classic experience.
---

---
For me its In Flames and Soilwork, and Atreyo mb. The absolute top of music related to wow
---
World buff being a private only meta, and it not being a thing at all in Vanilla would be in keeping with vanilla's "spirit". Therefore, removing world buffs to make people play like they did in 2005 would be #NoChanges.
---
heard female undead havw best animations, but havent played one
---
Wasn't there a sub for this?
---
What are you talking about?
---
The people that want to play classic wants to play it for this reason, are they just gonna not play now that they finally got it released?
---
Also, more importantly, what is your goal here exactly? Debating whether or not people want to play classic? What is good or bad? Feel free to do so elsewhere, the purpose of this thread was to try and make Classic to be played for as long as possible, that's it.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09LTT0xwdfw
---
This is literally what the video is about. How this is an awful game design choice in every way.
---
Yeah, its pretty to define what the hell is retail WoW today. Not an RPG, not an MMO.
---
I mean, no wonder people unsub in droves...they don't know WHAT they are playing.
---
Honestly it’s probably less memory to run this add-on then alt tab into google chrome to open the webpage up lol.
---
the major stakeholders likely know anyway
---
False. Once you cast, you Shadowmeld will fade and you will be visible.

I think Venruki and Ziqo streaming mages is convincing a lot of people to go mage. They are a wrecking crew.

Mobile healer flex is how I would describe their role. They run flags in wsg, and in group fights you mostly heal, but also disrupt the enemy team with stuff like roots, bash, and faerie fire.  Despite being resto specced they can add some damage to finish off people.  Druids struggle to heal when focused and are force into bear or to flea and lack magic dispel so they are more of a support healer then a primary one.
---
Cooking gives you more quest, also increases the value of the stuff you vendor, Fishing is top tier becuase you need fish for alchemy , raiding and also you can get crates with useful goodies. Leveling Tailoring is easy, enchanting is the hardes prof to lvl, specially as lvling, my advise is to also lvl fishing/cooking so you can compesate the amount of gold you need for enchanting, and also as soon you get robes of the void, drop tailoring for someting useful
---
I like to be optimal because that's what I enjoy. I like the theory crafting, the BiS lists and having optimal talents. I show up to raids but I also give 100% regardless of what I'm doing. 
---
For me being optimal isn't elitist. It's a frame of mind and when I raid that's where I set the bar. 
---
If I lead a raid then I expect everyone to be near that. If you aren't then you are holding back 39 other people. Those are not elitist expectations. Being 100% min/maxed for your spec and role is a whole other story though. When I lead raids I give leeway because being 100% min/maxed is ridiculous and unnecessary in classic wow. Optimal builds and optimal rotation and dps is all I expect.
---
Alterac biscuits come in phase 4?  No AV at launch.
---
Not sure about the AD stuff.
---
I'm not a big fan of a lot of the icons the game uses. To this day I still have no idea what the Whirlwind icon is supposed to represent. It just looks like one of those nets you catch butterflies in.
---
The Shaman heal spells bother me too. It's just a picture of the most poorly drawn hand possible surrounded by teeth things.
---
To add to your statistics, I'm French and I regularly follow the (only ?) French pserver pop.
---
The top 4 (at about 15% each) is always warrior / rogue / mage / shaman for Horde and warrior / rogue / paladin / mage for alliance.
---
Hunters are in the bottom 3 with warlocks and druids, around 9% pop each.
---
Priest are middle of the pack at 12%.
---
Ratio A/H is 57/43
---
If you add the numbers of warriors, rogues and mages they're around 50% pop, meaning in wpvp you'd better know how to handle these 3 classes since half of your encounters will be with them !
---
FINALLY a post I can post my opinion 
---
Wrath was my favorite expansion. I would of rather played a private server that was wrath but vanilla was the most populated one at the time so I kinda just got used to it. 
---
I would add barber shops. 
---
I would also make epic mounts cost 10,000 gold not 1000. 
---
I would implement new armor models into vanilla from wrath or new ones altogether. I'd made pvp armor, pve armor, and craftable armor equal with different stats, but equal in power. 
---
I wanna make a mega server with no pop limit and only dynamic respawns
---
"Don't use them if you don't want to."
---
If that had any merit, I wouldn't have bothered posting. Do you think using these was a part of the classic wow experience? If you don't want to be called an autist, stop repeating the no changes line over and over in the corner. It has no meaning. The point has always been no changes...to preserve the classic experience.
---
Indeed.
---
Not so hard it would not be done
---
&gt; It's also a way smaller change than either of those, which doesn't really change any gameplay elements directly.
---
But it *is* a balance change for the purpose of (from your perspective) improving Vanilla from what it actually was.  And while I would totally support this change in Classic+ or Classic TBC, I think we're better off leaving Vanilla as it was... rather than having a constant stream of arguments over what balance changes are minor enough to squeeze in and which are too major to fit Classic.
---
^ this
---
Wait really? So without a mage friend the best mana food a caster can get is level 45 water? Didn't remember that.
---
Many people who stay in retail will reconsider after a week or month or so when they have fear of missing out and don’t want to have their account be late to the party. Plenty of tentative players will go into classic out of a feeling of... obligation? And then realise what anyone else who’s played in recent years does - it’s not nostalgia, it’s superior game design.
---
&gt; But you are not the centre of the universe.  
---
Well in this very case I am, because Blizzard is on my side. They have specifically said that their goal is to replicate vanilla as it was in 1.12
---
Yup. Enjoy logging off for 1-24 hours before raid because you got a world buff. The spergs in the other thread are diehard defending this pserver practice because the ability to do it "technically existed in vanilla" even though nobody did this, ever.
---
Dude! Solid advice right there! The 25th is shopping night for me
---
That's why we want it removed. Because we think it's a stupid mechanic that doesn't add anything worthwhile, and only detracts from the raiding experience, while at the same time costing us time.
---
I'm not too concerned about time. I'll probably grind stuff and duel during the week (when I'm tired and can only play for 60-80mins, if even that, anyway) and do the more serious stuff (dungeons, battlegrounds) on week-ends.
---
What I'm looking forward to in Classic is the lack of constant updates like on retail, which cause me to miss out on content if I don't play all the damn time. I hope Classic will feel like a very long end of expansion patch.
---
Other way around.
---
Launch? Yes ofc.
---
Short term? Absolutely not.
---
Long term with Classic+? Yes
---
K, it was how vanilla was, so stop whining or get the buff.
---
There are many design choices people didnt like, why should they specidically change the world buffs?
---
You can guarantee that if it's a few million people they'll make a song and dance about it at least for a one-off.
---
Theres only so many times you can watch a Prot Warrior, Resto Druid, Monk and 2 Rogues run the exact same route through the same dungeon before it becomes boring.
---
&gt;but I people keep forgetting the 24h cooldown on world buffs
---
Probably because that doesnt exist?
---
I have the opposite problem, I'd love to play shaman, but all my friends want to play alliance :/
---
What time does classic launch?, I know the day but was wondering if theres a set time
---
Yeah, I have no clue on whirlwind. The Blue part looks like maybe it's a sweeping slash, but then the circle makes no sense.
---
Shaman heals are a bit odd, but at least the green colour scheme seems to line up. I always interpreted the "teeth" as vines with thorns to play more into the nature theme.
---
As someone trying to decide what race to make my shaman, how did you decide on tauren?
---
I wish that they had left plains running in.
---
Also against hunters from people not playing one.
---
&gt;This wasn't part of the vanilla experience
---
Dude.
---
#No.
---
You are not getting it. Classic is not about giving you a fun raid experience that appeals to your nostalgia. **It's about delivering the game as-it-was.** Classic is not supposed to be this fun version of Vanilla that fixes the things you didn't like about it. It's supposed to be the jagged, harsh version that it was. In fact, in large part when people play Classic WoW they should remember what they hated about it. 
---
As far as whether world buffs were an exploit, I don't believe for a second that the developers didn't know that people would take those buffs and use them in raids considering dragonslayer buffs COME FROM A RAID. The original version of C'thun declared "mathematically unbeatable" before being nerfed - I would put money on the table that he wasn't so much unbeatable but tuned around those buffs, and the playerbase was just not up to the challenge and didn't take those buffs into consideration. We can never know exactly the developer's intent unless we're a fly sitting on the wall back in 2004. We know now they didn't like the influence those buffs had on the game because they eventually removed them from raids, but we also know that they didn't like that Paladin's didn't have taunt in Classic. A design oversight doesn't necessarily mean an exploit. Stacking Moonkin on Mythic Blackhand is not an "exploit", it's just a design oversight that the encounter design encourages that behavior.
---
Perfect.
---
&gt;And like you said they if already had the vanilla code easy they aren't wasting that much time and effort?
---
They still would be wasting a lot of time. They have to make the code work with the modern engine which was not easy. Then they have to fix everything that gets messed up from it and implement new systems and keep old ones... Any time wasted on a personal agenda is not what a company like Blizzard does. They don't care if people actually want to play Classic and enjoy it, all they care about is the money that comes along side it.
---
&gt;Because we think it's a stupid mechanic that doesn't add anything worthwhile, and only detracts from the raiding experience, while at the same time costing us time.
---
Costing time is what makes it more rewarding in the end.
---
Running back to the boss after dying wastes a lot of time aswell, should they change that so you spawn next to the boss instead?
---
I do too. Gives the race some flavor
---
Whenever I try to use these macros on my priest he just says "#showtooltip". Then if I delete that line it just doesn't work. What's wrong with my game?
---
&gt;Basically, the average retail player is spending maybe 30-40% of an expansion playing it, and the rest not playing it or even unsubed.
---
Where are your metrics mate? Or are you just pulling numbers out of your arse?
---
I will literally unsub between raid releases. There is zero reason to pop into the game when we've cleared current content, just like on retail.
---
&gt;BfA will stop losing subs...but they will lose players. To Classic.
---
You sound so sure of yourself, are you perhaps a visionary? A seer?
---
&gt;Do not be surprised that after 6 months of Classic, half (or more) of the BfA player base from August will play Classic as their main game.
---
I'm certain they will. People who like retail will go over to classic. Certainly :)
---
&gt;Don't be surprised of the snowball effect of losing players. For months now, many BfA guilds have issues forming raids...after August 27th, MOST BfA guilds will probably disband, merge or fully move to Classic.
---
It's the end of a patch cycle, 8.2 is hitting in 2-3 weeks. It's so funny reading you, you sound like some lunatic who thinks classic is the second coming of Jesus our lord and saviour.
---
&gt;Make no mistake. Retail will still exist...but it will be dead. There will still be players...but they will have massive issues enjoying the game, due to lack of players.
---
I will certainly lose sleep over the fact that retail will be just dead. I will have "massive issues" as well ...
---
&gt;Underestimating Classic "crack" effect is a big mistake. Retail players should better admit this, and prepare for.They should try to diminish the effects of Classic impact on retail player base.
---
Are you perhaps addicted to some kind of substance? Are you a professional in the field of addictions? Video game addictions?
---
&gt;Because waiting and hope that "crazy" Classic players are wrong, is going to bite them in the ass.
---
The only thing biting me in the ass is my dog as it is wondering why I'm laughing my ass off currently. Thank you for the mass pastor, I've learned a lot!
---
You're like a broken record right now. You've created an imaginary problem, just so you can play the victim. You can spend the time it would take getting world buffs talking to a psychiatrist instead to get some help. This is not a healthy way to live life.
---
I thought it's because it's the bouncing glaive from WCIII?
---
Because people play classic for fun, not to get max level. This is the reason, why classic is so good. It is just a damn good game and you get enjoyment just by playing it.
---
Oh the times where classes mattered.
---
Maybe you should actually read his post you fucking dillhole. He is **complaining** about **classic**. He is saying the implementation that is in Classic should go away and it should be left in BFA. Perhaps you should learn to not spaz out with the mention of retail so hard that you don't understand how he isn't talking about it.
---
I'd love to play a healing hunter.
---
Yes. How the fuck could I be replying to a point made in the video but never brought up in the OP, if I hadn't watched the video?
---
I plan to level Fishing/Cooking on the main for sure, was just wondering if it's useful for alts really or more of a waste of time.
---
&gt; also as soon you get robes of the void, drop tailoring for someting useful
---
Hmm, there aren't items that require Tailoring to actually wear for locks?
---
Could replace it with Alchemy afterwards...
---
Maybe I could do Herbalism/Tailoring or Skinning/Tailoring, skinning on a Warlock sounds so silly, though.
---
So what happened to the #nochanges everyone keeps prattling on about?
---
World buffs were a thing back then. Most guilds used a couple here and there on order to help on progression nights. They were nice and added a lot of flavor since it felt like a server "event" when a guild did the turn in.
---
If new guilds wanna go ultra neckbeard and stack up buffs let them. Thats hours spent co-ordinating and prepping their raid to clear content. I fail to see anything wrong with using the tools the game provided.
---
I think some players are just getting their epeens in a twist because they wont be no-lifing it to the same extent as these "world buffing" players. Well too bad. That's how classic was. Just play the game your way and enjoy it. 
---
If you're worried about pvp then thats the bar set by your competition. Better get to strategizing or as we used to say in the old days, "QQ scrub"
---
I personally will be raiding casually, the content is old and ive seen most of it before, if younguns and nolifers wanna clear everything in the first weeks of each phase then let them. It doesn't affect me in the slightest, aside from pvp. Which as a 30something I have already accepted that I dont have the time to be as competitive as I was back in 2005.
---
I just leveled a shaman to 55 on a private server. I can't say I'll miss the experience. Dropping short range totems over and over as you or your group move around just isn't my cup of tea.
---
If there's not a blue post on the official classic forum then we haven't heard anything.
---
Always check there first.
---
The projection though.
---
You can't just turn in a head whenever you want (and get a buff). This is more than just DM buffs, you do know that right? You are discussing a mechanic that ONLY EXISTS ON PRIVATE SERVERS. 
---
It's like arguing with a trump supporter. The projection is off the charts.
---
And just because something gets listed over vendor price doesn't mean that it will sell at that price or that it will sell the first time you list it.
---
World buffs only gained any real popularity towards the very end of Naxxramas, even among guilds competing for world firsts. Prior to Kel'thuzad there weren't many challenging bosses in the same sense. Loatheb was a consumable check, Thaddius was more about surviving the polarity mechanic. 4HM was about getting 8 tanks with the taunt hit cap. Patchwerk would be a good target for world buffs being a gear check, but he is a gear check designed for precisely the level of gear that hardcore guilds who had been farming AQ40 for some time had coming into Naxxramas, so it wasn't really needed. In the end I believe world buffs were only ever used for Sapphiron and particularly Kel'thuzad.
---
There's a couple of things like that that only really showed themselves near the end or even during private servers that you can consider detrimental. The Dire Maul farming is another example, as very few people knew that was a thing. The few that knew were secretive about it to gain advantages over others, and as such the handful of people on each server that knew about it made no real impact on the economy. Yet now that everyone knows, it causes gold to hold significantly less value than it did back then.
---
I think it is fair to question whether things that were only really explored starting in 1.12 or later (and for one that KT kill was in 1.12) have a significantly negative impact on the game or not.
---
You can also boost a character straight to lvl 110 , bypassing most of the leveling.
---
It isn't part of the journey anymore on retail, it's mainly a chore you need to finish quickly to get to the "real " endgame, sadly even said endgame sux too so /shrug.
---
maybe on pvp servers, but more people will go hunter than rogue because rogue isnt really that great imo
---
Get yourself a wand. It is stupid, but at least you aren't just standing around whacking stuff with a stick - or trying to because you can't even hit anything.
---
And time costs.
---
The problem with that is that he relies on world buffs in raids being an exploit in order to argue that he's not asking for a balance change, but just fixing an exploit. His argument relies on it not being hyperbole, because if it's only supposed to be taking as hyperbole, then he's suddenly arguing for balance changes.
---
&gt; There is no reason to believe that they won't become a requirement
---
They existed in Vanilla but weren't a requirement in Vanilla.  Only the absolute try-hardest of guilds (like the [world first KT kill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CNN_Cn2L2A)) used world buffs.
---
&gt; allowing them is actually going to hurt the classic wow experience that everyone wants to recreate.
---
What will hurt the classic wow experience is the competitiveness you see on private servers to top meters and speed run raids.  Vanilla plays like a game of Dungeons and Dragons in that min-maxing everything will lead to a shitty experience.  The tools to min-max were there at the time, but most people had the sense not to ruin their experience by using all of them.
---
Keep your feet on the ground.
---
I can't comment on any rage fixes in particular because I don't know what you're talking about, but in general none of the classes got enough changes to make a substantial difference in the leveling experience. It was mostly QoL and stuff that didn't really make a difference outside raiding. As for additional content, that'll mostly help with the quest drought you'll hit in your 50s.
---
Either way, none of the complaints about "vanilla being easy" are about any of the things that would have changed in the patches.
---
There's a horde-only quest in RFK to pick up a piece of bat shit and return it to an apothecary in UC.
---
Look I'm not saying that it's a conspiracy but I just think we should take things with a grain of salt from the same company that started the "FUN DETECTED" meme.
---
haha yes :D
---
BoE greens can be hard to sell, especially if the stats are not good. You could always try to last the best greens and disenchant the rest. Enchanting mats are a lot easier to sell, and a lot cheaper to list.
---
&gt;Can we Create a "Classic Wow AV, before 1.12 nerfs please, everyone on classic seems to want it
---
So you didn't claim the majority wanted it? Then what does "Everyone on Classic seems to want it" mean? Can you backup how everyone on classic wants it?
---
if it goes up drastically, they will
---
The bloom in the beta is a about 10x stronger than Vanilla, at the moment.
---
Turning it down to "Classic" graphic settings help cut some back but it's annoying as hell and blows out bright colors like th YELLOW SNOW in AV.
---
You don't even understand what projection means. Keep exposing your own lack of knowledge throughout the thread all you want. I'm sure that'll work out great for you.
---
Literally just don't use them if you don't want to. What a weird victim complex you've got...
---
I know I might be the ONLY one here that thinks this, but I just don't feel good levelling without Spiritual Focus. The moment I respecced into deep ret from holy that I did early on back in the day (because it was the first tab open lol), I started to notice that I was dying more. Much of that had to do with pushback on self healing. When I was specced into holy, and I pulled too many mobs, as ret I was dead unless Lay of Hands AND DP AND potions AND Blessing of Freedom was up. As holy, I could facetank them and outheal them, even if I had 3 mobs of the same level as me on me. I could just white damage the primary mob, and then get enough mana up for heals later.  
---
What I'm interested in, is how holy, while being both lower dps AND mobilty for levelling than ret, basically makes you better in an emergency situation, something that happens alot in classic. It saves you time on corpse runs, gold on repair costs, and allows you to escape ganks more easily because you can heal straight through a rogue's dps combo.
---
Yes, this has already happened multiple times on beta.
---
Argent dawn mana biscuits.
---
But almost noone used world buffs in Vanilla like they do on private servers now, so you just want Classic to be like your private servers. It would be closer to the real deal to disable them in raids.
---
We're talking about after classic holy jesus
---
Marks with a slow weapon and a decent crit rate will own him. You scatter the Nova deadzone and fd trap to get range. After that you aimshot multi again and he's toast. This is why hunters guard farm/stables.
---
Northrend is based off the north
---
That’s even worse.
---
Well to be fair you need 300 Tailoring for the 3 set bonus Bloodvine set (2% crit) , but that si ZG and to be honest, tailoring isnt a great money maker, in my opinion you should drop it and get alchemy or engi
---
That Demoman is not one of us! \~hon hon hon
---
Indeed. So theres no 55 water in phase 1. The quest to get 55 food/water is a Dire Maul quest.
---
Judging from the angle, the screenshot must've been taken from flying on dragonback.
---
I’ll definitely PvP when I’m not doing any dungeons or raids and warstomp is another nuisance for healers to deal with that only taurens offer on top of being very aggressive with r1 earth shock/frost shock. That’s from a PvP standpoint.
---
Aesthetics wise taurens look awesome to me. My first ever 60 back in vanilla was a troll shaman and as soon as I started getting raid gear I said wtf I look like a clown. Apart from appearance I also like taurens cast animations when they heal. I saw a tauren resto shaman POV video versus Ouro in AQ40 and fell in love to be honest.
---
U can gank as a priest all classes are scumbags choose 1 and git gud.
---
Why?
---
How does rested XP work in Classic? Log out at an inn, and is it something like 1% of XP per hour? Just curious, I never paid attention to it. Gotta be efficient!
---
&gt;The exact same thing happened with OSRS and RS3. 
---
No it didn't. OSRS wasn't very popular on release and was declining pretty fast until they decided to start adding player voted content. 
---
Polling community on changes and future content was what made OSRS popular not that it rolled the game back to 2007.
---
Nobody got the world buffs back in the day.
---
&gt; I don't really feel strongly one way or another about the topic personally, but I don't agree with the notion that "it was possible to do but basically unused, therefore it's fine even if the entire server abuses it".
---
I would say that world buffs in raids are a net negative, and if I could go back in time to change Vanilla then that would be somewhere on the list of things I'd want to change.  But I'm pretty strongly against the idea of making balance changes to Classic for the purpose of improving the experience.
---
There was a 6v6 rated BG tourney like 2 weeks ago, it was actually pretty interesting.
---
One thing to consider, is that while retail racials are meant to be roughly balanced, this was not the case in vanilla.  Human weapon skill is on the order of 8% better for raiding.  Dwarf for priest and orc or undead for pvp are similarly broken.
---
They will gladly report subscribercount when classic hits. Trust me. Nobody wants to floss on garbage but if you got something to be proud of, flossing your shit is a natural result
---
I think I made my decission. Im gonna play with a friend and going druid tank and shaman as tauren seems like fun. I know druid tank isnt very viable but it should be ok for leveling and switching to resto at level 60 is always an option. Bear aoe plus chain lightning seems awesome. Plus that sweet ghost wolf + cheetah form. I havent done alot of research concerning mana dependancy and what spells are present in the game so this is alleen Just speculation tho. Also gonna level a warlock on the side.
---
What makes you think that Classic is gonna be like Vanilla? There is centuries of private server meta inbetween that changed everything. Your "vanilla" experience really doesnt mean much.

It doesnt matter how few got the buffs back in the day, they were available so they should also be available in classic.

If you dont want to waste time getting them, then just skip them.
---
I'm changing my decision between rogue, hunter and warlock every day... seriously Classic can't come soon enough so I can finally choose one class and focus on it.

---
Alright thanks guys. Seems like spell crits the way to go
---
Does Blessing of Freedom prevent/affect Dazed? I'd assume not but wanted to check.
---
But it actually wasn’t how world buffs effected the world in vanilla. If guilds were farming them as a requirement for every raid, blizzard 100% would’ve patched it earlier.
---
Why anyone would want to keep world buffs except tryhard private server players is beyond me.
---
No no it’s easier now, because I had two 60s in vanilla so I won’t be playing those two classes this time around. Paladin was a pain to level, rogue was pretty enjoyable though. Had a ton of alts. Either Druid or hunter for me. Druid is nice and sleek, Hunter is the solo god.
---
Is there any guide or something on Flag Running. Seems quite important and intimidating as a role.
---
Isn't the whirlwind icon the same as blademasters ulti in WC III?

Exactly, i hate the opposite when the tank stops and tells mana. Fuck me i know if i need to drink or not, makes a huge difference if you drink after 1-2 less packs every single time, especially in a longer dungeon
---
Sabaton

I guess I'm a raider then.
---
This isn't true though because if you talk to most Arena players they would tell you S15 was the best season. There's basically 3 stand out seasons s7 from Wrath,s15 in MoP,s18 at the end of WoD.

Not everyone wants to do the math or theorycraft the absolute best build. And I can only speak from myself, but it's not hard to go "Oh I guess I put a point into Pathfinding now. Guess I'll be able to move faster."

Mglad here too, I enjoyed tbc/wotlk style of play more tbh, there's just something appealing when not all classes have the same cds/defensives, it felt more flavorful but that's just my opinion.
---
I think that's probably the connection, but it's a really weak one. Hunters are using it with bows, guns, and crossbows, not glaives, and it's not a bouncing attack like the glaives. All in all, it's a huge stretch.
---
You sound fun

I second this! I found them through the shaman discord and they have chill informative streams

Barber shops I think is self explanatory, as is new armor models. I will add it.

Why would you want to increase the epic mount cost to 10'000? There might be other gold sinks available. 
---
Why would you want dynamic respawns?
---
As for technical changes such as pop limits I don't think there's much to do.
---
There is a popular addon (dont remember name) that announces taunt resists, so it should be possible to do the same for your case.
---
Paladin, actually the most boring fucking class in every single aspect.

Seriously, they're perseverating.

That's why you stack spell damage* so you increase damage per mana while at the same time reducing how long you have to drink for.

Sure. Look at the forums. :)
---
Buffadin
---
I agree with most of this, although I enjoy running around the world getting world buffs. Most of the raids are pretty much trivial to begin with but I guess this makes them even easier.
---
However I'm 99% certain Blizzard will not remove world buffs.

Straight to Video or Shut Me Up by Mindless Self Indulgence obviously.
---
Guilds: why not just require world buffs from hybrid DPS?
---
They were available, people not using them as much back in the day doesnt matter.
---
And its diferent on private servers since for example the world buffs from the dragon heads had no cooldown like they do in vanilla/classic.
---
I'm talking about the private server meta, I thought that much would be obvious since world first MC to end of vanilla wasn't even two years and as such raiding for "years" in vanilla wouldn't be possible.
---
90% of guilds absolutely couldn't care less if you bring world buffs to farm content, and these guilds are all way more hardcore than most guilds will be in classic, focusing on speedruns and competitiveness.
---
Warrior. It's too boring. All you are is a set of melee attacks. Other classes have cool spells, or stealth or pets or something.

Reading stuff like this really gets my blood boiling. Stop trying to dictate how people want to play the game and come up with wild speculative reasons for it that have no basis in reality. You only get to raid a few hours each week, so you spend the rest of your time grinding various materials to buff yourself and make that time really matter. Adding world buffs into the mix multiplies the effects of all your other consumables and actually makes them feel worth farming. For gods sake, everyone can have a level20 warlock alt outside the instance and literally soulstone every single person in the raid before you attempt harder stuff like cthun. If someone wants to do that, who are you to tell them they can’t?
---
How exactly is entering a raid with a bunch of mongs that have zero ambition and nothing to lose any different than queuing up for LFR on retail? It’s a 15 year old game that wasn’t designed for raids to be the only activity you do. It takes some truly special players to not be able to eventually clear the available raids.
---
World buffs are a complete non-issue for everyone except the few guilds that keep poaching all the good players. In a 40man roster there’s plenty of room for tourists who asspull stuff that will either cause the entire raid to die or sometimes just the tanks. Both of these mean that no-one can play as a roided up beefcake anymore. Unless you’re playing in one of these tryhard guilds, competing for logs is literally impossible because they kill bosses literally ~60-70% quicker than your mediocre guild does.
---
If you throw in the towel after you die to something, you’re a terrible teamplayer. Playing with a ridiculous amount of crit on a warrior feels buttery smooth and losing your buffs is devastating, but gives you the option to take over offtank duties from someone who still has buffs. Most classes have secondary roles like this and adapting on the fly is just something a good teamplayer does. Shit has a tendency to happen sometimes and that’s no big deal as long as everyone understands to make the best of it.
---
To all the special snowflakes that are set on playing moonkin/retribution: getting world buffs and flasking up makes your contributions to the raid quite comparable to your non buffed/flasked counterparts.
---
There is a 2-12 hour delay on these buffs depending on faction you are on. Please explain to me how the expectation to get one of these and logoff is me inventing a problem, when you are claiming they only take 10-15 minutes to get. How does it only take 10-15 minutes to get buffs on a 2-12 hour cooldown? Or are you being disingenuous about it only taking 10-15 minutes assuming you logoff for the entirety of that time before raid? Don't need to respond because I know the answer. You are arguing from a private server standpoint that has different mechanics.
---
Exactly why I wouldn't be upset if they released dual spec with an 8hr cooldown which must be swapped at a trainer.
---
Wow. Edgy reply bro. Haven’t seen this type of comment before at all.
---
Nelf has better base stats while dwarf has his stone-form and Rifle specialist. But Rifles are not BiS if you min/max Hunter and the Base stat is (IMO) better than the Stone-form if you do not go main PvP. 
---
Unfortunately NElf Hunters are a meme so you’re gonna get a lot of flak for playing that.
---
There's nothing "esports" about world first PvE races though. They're largely about pooping in a sock, the anti-thesis of the fantasy Blizzard wants to sell when presenting eSports. 
---
Remember, eSports is not just about viewership of the event, but also hooking players on their product.  The "collegiate" program in Hearthstone has hooked something like several dozen players at the very least, possibly hundreds of players, to spend an additional hundred/thousands of dollars to get the entire card pool in multiple regions to practice. They're selling the fantasy to these college players that if they just put in the money and the time they can be an eSports pro. You can't box up the fantasy of being "unemployed" for weeks/months at a time to race world first in WoW.
---
The Arena scene and M+ scene are different. Players can do that part-time while going to college and become an "eSports pro". It's compatible with the fantasy. 
---
That said, could Blizzard somehow monetize the world first race? Sure. I don't think it would fit under eSports though. Maybe some sort of marketing/promotional push for the content itself, but even then, I don't know if the lens that world-first racing presents is favorable. The kind of trickery and raid-stacking guilds do doesn't look good. I also don't know if people really care to watch wipe after wipe on content or listen to players whining about the content on voice chat.
---
Drowning Pool - Bodies hit floor ofc
---
The only way to keep them from pulling is to not heal them at the end of a fight.  Finish the fight and tank's at 40%?  Leave 'em while you get mana.  They'll stay put.
---
Microsoft figured out mobile better than anyone else. But they can't force people to adopt it when the two other markets are already so saturated. Anyone who has ever used an Windows phone knows it was a superior experience when the apps you need are there. To this day I use an  Windows phone skin for my android phone because the Android experience is garbage.
---
It depends how how easy the instance is for your group.  I've done plenty of runs in the beta where the tank charges in when the healer is half mana, and it's fine because by the time they actually need heals the priest/pally/druid is at full mana anyway. You actually save a bit of time this way.
---
Now if your group is struggling to clear the trash then this is a really bad thing to do.
---
No you're just nitpicking on pointless hypotheticals, do you have anything constructive to bring please do so. It's about finding out **what** people liked with each expansion that is important, they have all had their ups and downs as far at least in my experience. If you like a particular expansion please say why so I can add it if you think it would be a good fit in Classic :)
---
The hunger can't move back?
---
Ret paladin is a blast to level imo 🤔
---
I went shockadin, because 14-15 year old brain said heal.
---
They had said in an investor meeting like 3 years ago that services now made up roughly half of the revenue in WoW.
---
If competition is involved, everything will attempt to become an esport if enough interest is shown.
---
You... *bought* water!?
---
Lock + healer is one of the most hilariously weak trash combos that exist for 2v2, it loses to everything.
---
True, I believe Argent Dawn is in at the start, its not a Naxx thing.
---
We are cursed with knowledge
---
The guy from Prodigy video Firestarter.
---
As a priest, as soon as I log on I'll just find a mage and ask them for water in exchange for a tip. While leveling I usually ask for 8-10 stacks. At 60, I'll ask for 6-8 stacks.
---
It feels a bit premature to think about what will happen when people get bored of a game that hasn’t even been released. So many things could change between now and then.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if Classic has 1/5 or less of the players after 1 month that it did on launch.
---
Primadonna healer much?
---
Oh boy this is actually a complex question - it depends on your spec. I'm going to take a lot of crap for this, so let me preface by saying that this is just my opinion after playing all of the classes that can heal.   Druids can of course be resto with 31 points which makes them decent healers, but you don't really do like a paladin and just follow people around and heal/cleanse in the thick of it wearing plate and being pretty tough. It's also not like a priest that needs peels and works offensively dispelling buffs, hots, mage armor, etc. 
---
So let's start with resto FC spec [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0p00bZxGMoZVeboeq0o](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0p00bZxGMoZVeboeq0o)
---
1) WSG it's your job is to capture flags and stay alive with your speed, ability to shift out of snares, and OH SHIT abilities like Nature's Swiftness and Swiftmend.
---
2) AB you actually do an AMAZING job of defending flags! What you do is wait for someone to try to cap and you come out of stealth and DoT, which leads them to come after you...and you do what druids do - kite. Keep tagging them with moonfire and insect swarm, if you can, you root. But you're always going to Travel Form and run away and then they will try to hit the flag again and you simply tag them with a DoT before then can finish until help arrives. The group might ask you to follow around and heal, and that's fine too. Generally you want to keep FF up on any rogues you see and be really careful not to get caught by rogues. Keep DoTs up on people and off-heal and tag flags. Your Travel form and movement abilities really shine here and your biggest threat is rogues locking you down, and keep your distance from spriests and locks (they can't catch you like a rogue, but can ruin your day)
---
3) AV stealth capping flags with rogues is ideal. You can also heal
---
Outside of resto, the answer gets more complicated. Once you get spellpower gear, you can play a lot more offensively and really trash people. Let's just for the sake of argument say that you get very decent SP gear and you want to PvP as more of an offensive caster:  29/11/11  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0pMxbMxsLxG0oZVcbo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0pMxbMxsLxG0oZVcbo) .  This is really good because you sneak up on people, root, wrath, moonfire, insect swarm, and if you have the time starfire is a really long cast but it can crit really high. You also have feral charge for interrupting casters and enough points in resto for insect swarm which adds to your DoT capabilities. Your role now is similar to the above because you can still heal given your SP, but you're more of a killer now, but you are always kiting. Play like a hunter and keep your distance, always.
---
If you're more into the feral hybrid thing, you'll still want Nature's Swiftness and some ability to heal so 0/30/21 is pretty good, very good early on without gear.  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxGMscddxVvboco](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxGMscddxVvboco)  Note that you can take  point out of HOTW in feral and pick up Nature's Grasp which some people absolutely love, and you might too. I personally can live without it for the extra stats but again it depends on your preference. In WSG you can still run flags, in AB you can defend flags more using melee and stronger bear form to defend until help arrives. You can also cap flags using your stealth, and you can throw quick offheals to help your team. Of course you have roots, moonfire, insect swarm as well too and you want to use your full set of capabilities (FF on rogues, cat form focus priest healers, etc.) in different situations. 
---
Pure feral I'm not even going to get into, but if you go that route...good luck with that.  There are also a lot more options that I didn't get into. Opinions on druids vary A LOT. I highly suggest the classic druid discord  [https://discordapp.com/invite/UmPt3QP](https://discordapp.com/invite/UmPt3QP)  as they have some REALLY good druid players there like Taladril, Stormx, Javel, Ebn, and others.
---
Not to put on a tin foil hat or anything but here's my conspiracy theory...
---
I had thought I finally decided on Undead Warlock, but the feeling of playing Tauren Warrior keeps invading my thoughts....
---
There's evidence of a lot of top guilds using them for many bosses in naxx. Even for Nihilum there are screenshots showing them with world buffs on quite a few bosses in that raid. There may be an argument for removing world buffs from other raids but having them for Naxx progression is an entirely vanilla like experience.
---
There are tons of things that were not part of Vanilla but will be part of Classic not because they weren't in the game but because we know a lot more about the game now and the meta changed.
---
If you really wanted true Vanilla experience you would ban most addons for the first half of Classic since not a lot of people used them, but allow clearly broken addons to exist like decursive because they did in Vanilla.
---
Also for the leveling perma-ban people using outside sources to look up where quest items are because at the beggining of Vanilla everyone did the quests without help.
---
There's a difference between being a lot stronger in raids and straight up one-shotting a boss. If people take the extra time to get world buffs and get stronger, that's just part of the game even if people didn't do it in Vanilla.
---
&gt; Why show that one of your games is doing bad just to prove a point? 
---
Because it is entirely possible that Blizzard is planning to either massively change Retail or put it on life support,  or change it significantly, if their data shows a much higher support long term for old MMORPG design.
---
You think that the level squish announced for (probably) next expansion is the ONLY thing they are preparing to change in Retail?
---
If Blizzard is considering that current model of WoW is failing (and it obviously is) and it is unsustainable long term, presenting the low numbers of BfA in tandem with the very good numbers of Classic,  will be their public argument, to the players, that retail needs a massive overhaul, a reset or significant changes.
---
**I am NOT saying that this is the case, but if it is, Blizzard will use the low sub numbers of BfA as a solid argument for an overhaul, reset or significant changes for Retail.**
---
Orc sl warlock. Yeah good luck fighting that in wpvp.
---
Best way to do this is to get sweetfx and turning all bloom settings way up
---
+1. BFA has bad class/dungeon design from what I understand. MDI was fun and popular during Legion because it had better dungeons and better class design.
---
Because most people did not understand their value.
---
Also Warlock Soulstone gives Res Sickness according to the manual. Bunch of cool legacy stuff in there.
---
Did/do warlocks ever summon a doomguard or infernal in a raid? Are they ever worthwhile?
---
Also, ally lock worth it over horde for the pally 30% reduced threat buff? Rarely ever were shams put in a lock group for their totem.
---
Exactly what I mean. I mainly played NE rogue neck then and wanted to play something different this time around. But I also want that exact same feeling from back then...
---
that's what it was always going to be.
---
beta or not
---
&gt;"Classic will be nothing more than a private server with better graphics."
---
I mean...what do I say here? The grass isn't always greener on the other side? I don't want to say your feelings aren't valid but...this is pretty pessimistic, and if I was armchair psychologist-ing you I'd probably just say: you're just jealous and taking it out on the game itself. I mean, I wanted into the beta too, and didn't get it, but I understand it's 80% marketing and 20% beta testing, and my reasons for wanting into the beta aren't that important anyway.
---
So uh... Hey. Are you okay, OP?
---
When they announced classic in November I resubbed. I had not played since cata so figured I beat prepare. So much has changed I'm not even sure it's been helpful, starting with leveling. 
---
I decided to level up a mage for a couple of reasons. First, I had never played a mage before and wanted to learn the class, it's rotations and so on. Second, I wanted to experience some of the content I had missed out on over the years of not playing as well as experience some of the story. 
---
Aside from the differences with talents and specs, the first part has been fairly successful, I do understand how mages work. The real problem is that everything is so damn facerolly and unchallenging I didn't learn how to really maximize my class. Mana Regen is nuts. Potions are basically useless and mobs mostly die before they get a melee in unless you're aoeing. 
---
The second part has been a failure. Zones now scale.. so barrens is like 1-60 depending on your level. Same for all of the expansions. There's also exp boosts with war mode and heirlooms so you will outlevel an expansion in typically 1-2 zones. I think it took me 5 zones total to hit 60, 2 more for 70, 2 for 80, 1.5 for 90, 3 for 100, 2 for 110 and I'm currently 115 and just finished zandalar(sp)? So to say I've experienced much of the story or content is a farce.
---
I remember when I started bfa expansion and healed the wound in the world or whatever and it's just a giant sword in the desert. I was like.. uh what? Apparently in the previous expansion it got weird as shit and there was a giant space dude with a sword and a spaceship and illidan killed him but not before he stabbed azeroth. Idk man, I only killed some demons in azshara (sp) and some stuff in highmountain before I moved on and was 110. Was confusing as shit. 
---
Basically, it feels like I missed out on everything I wanted to catch up on and I've got almost 5 days played. I get why people just buy level boosts I guess. I wish it was better paced so that you could catch up on the history of the world and what's gone on but I guess people don't care like they did in classic. It's weird.
---
So you suggesting that a better spec is automatically more fun is not arrogant?
---
Lol
---
Yes, use what you find to level it and purposely buy the mats too. Getting to bag patterns first is big. Also getting the shadow weave, frost weave and fel cloth patterns. As an example,  look up some of the mats for those patterns and make plans to grind a couple levels on the mobs that drop them when you get to that level.
---
Oh I see what this is. You think that, like on private servers, people raid 24/7 so you get people turning in the head outside of normal raid hours!
---
Well, that's not the case in Classic. Glad we got that out of the way so you can go on to find another reason for your victim complex.
---
Still waiting for your rationale behind why you totally _definitely_ need to get world buffs.
---
&gt;at which point it almost makes more sense to just get another toon to 60.
---
Where do you guys find the time!
---
Woah, looks cool. Have you thought about whether these ports / parts are connected via train / ships / zeppelins?
---
I shared this on a couple of other similar threads but this is the site I've been using since I found it.  
---
https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/
---
You could always hold out for TBC :) In that expansion hunters hardcounter mages.
---
Just a few more years hopefully.
---
Can someone explain it like I'm 5 what the various seals that Paladins have and when each is used?
---
Maybe. I've never played WC3. I'm not much of an RTS guy.
---
Skill helps?
---
Hunters: Skull of impending doom to become immune to scatter trap. 
---
Mages: This is a skill match up in every sense of the word
---
Warlokc: SL is basically impossible to fight, but reflector and good opener stunlocks helps a lot.
---
&gt;Priest, Mage and Warlock trainers stand right next to Shadow Priest Sarvis. And then he gives you a Scroll   
---
&gt;from them  
---
&gt; which says to   
---
&gt;go and visit them  
---
&gt;... even as they're   
---
&gt;standing right there  
---
&gt;.
---
Maybe it's just because I'm high, but isn't it because the scroll is old and maybe they weren't standing there when the person wrote it down?
---
I think it's reasonable as long as the thing that you're changing was not part of the vanilla experience in the first place. But I'll admit that I'm also scared of Blizzard slippery sloping this into changing things that fall outside of that as well.
---
This is why a lot of people just vendor a lot of shit while leveling.
---
I'm an altoholic so of course I'll probably roll every class (like a complete idiot), but from previous experiences I have to say that my least played class is none other than warlock. The aesthetic just doesn't do it for me, I guess?
---
I guess it'd probably be Hunter as well, which is weird considering I played Hunter a ton in actual Vanilla. Trying it again after all the years it feels awful
---
1 wipe in classic is a huge time waste, running back +rebuffing and everything. Avoiding wipes with world buffs saves time
---
Hi, /u/MaltaDuDe

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c1abu0/av_win_ratio_horde_vs_alliance/).
---
Thank you for your absurd opinion that literally no one here agrees with.
---
no changes
---
These guys don't camp the streamer into the ground killing streams. They kill them one or two times, excite their viewers, and honestly getting ganked by them on your stream has become a right of passage on beta.
---
I'm firmly alliance, even though most of my remaining family that plays will probably go horde. :( I might roll a shaman with them for kicks but I can't imagine it ever getting to the cap, because, well, who has that kind of time to have multiple capped alts? If I do, they'll be on one server...preferably.
---
Wow this might be the dumbest post I've ever seen. You basically said the Beta is the real game, and official launch is pointless. Wtf. Go outside
---
Don't forget that vanilla is rock paper scissors for classes. All classes will have their counters at equal skill and gear. Play what you'll enjoy.
---
I wouldn't say refuse to play, but I've played since Vanilla and have never once really played any of the 3 Clothies.
---
That's the thing... play what you want, and find people who are okay with that. I play MEME specs, but I'm not gonna get mad when the elitist neckbeards don't want me in their raid.
---
"Well, that's not the case in Classic. "
---
Prove this statement, ill wait.
---
Yea I’m understand that with the 25% resist it’s likely that at least one of those stubs gets resisted. In that case I’m wondering if it would then be best to immediately vanish and do my stun lock rotation into an improved gouge &gt; sap &gt; re-stuns. However I know that with improved sap you basically drop combat the exact instant the direction of the gouge ends. I’ve been able to land the gouge &gt; restealth &gt; sap before, it’s just very close.
---
Tons of assumptions/10. Most players take a premade spec at 60 anyways... I really don't think it affects someone's knowledge of the game THAT much if they don't want to workout the math behind why one talent is chosen over another.
---
Waste of time, really.
---
With or without world buffs, good players will still be first, and bad players will still be last. The content will be cleared fast, no matter what, by top dog guilds.
---
However, most (and by most I mean well over half) guilds will not clear BWL, no matter what.
---
When top guilds will farm Naxx, most guilds will wipe on Chromaggus and Nefarian.
---
By the time most guilds will have a change to go past BWL, new content will be announced.
---
Well if you're doing bwl for T2/bis you'll have the head which you can turn in for a buff to help with aq/naxx
---
We had a separate alt friendly guild that we would leech the world buffs off of when clearing aq or when we needed some help with a particular boss in naxx.
---
Look! I spotted a salty warrior!
---
Sure. If you want to PvP for example, the Gnome escape artist is amazing. Gnome warriors give mages a hard time for example. Gnome escape artist and +5% int for a mage is incredibly strong. Dwarf rogue with Stone Form for PvP is very strong. Dwarf Priest is disgustingly strong with 30 sec cooldown on Fear Ward, 3 min CD on Stone Form, and arguably the 10 min CD on Desperate Prayer. Humans help you grind rep faster, the +swords help tanks and DPS if you're min/maxing. Shadowmeld + cat prowl on a Night Elf hunter is very useful in PvP when you need to stop and eat/drink (and you will) without being seen or being targetted.
---
Of course Night Elf Priest is absolutely THE BEST priest in the game because mailbox dancing, flippy, and watching that hot ass jiggle back and forth for 60 levels running around questing. MMMMmmmm NELF priest baby, gimme that hot ass over OP dwarf any day!
---
Just depends what you want.
---
I enjoy running around the world getting world buffs, to me it's a fun part of the game. I enjoy ganking people with world buffs. It was in Vanilla it should be in Classic. 
---
There are things that weren't in Vanilla and I would love to be in the game, like harder bosses, Alchemist only consumables and more consumables in general I love potions, but that wasn't in Vanilla so I would never ask for them to be put in Classic.
---
Flag running is basically just a sub-role which is usually performed by druids and shamans, since they can use travel/ghost form for a flat movement speed increase.
---
On retail, and I don't know if this transitions to classic as well, but prot warriors could also be flag carriers due to their tankyness and movement abilities such as heroric leap and intervene. Given that warriors do not have these abilities in classic I doubt their use as flag carriers in bgs.
---
I work in aviation. That could translate well, r-right?
---
I honestly think it's just a testament to how horrendous the gaming scene is right now. There's so little well rounded mmorpgs out right now that no one is truly satisfied. The beta level caps have created a unique one time scene that is an experience in its own. The working class (40+ hours a week, streaming excluded) is probably not playing the beta consistently and saving themselves.
---
It's useful so I can collect horde only cooking recipes. I'll just need a friend on horde side to get them for me.
---
Many bis items for warlock come from tailoring and the chest is a tailor only item.
---
You must not have played much vanilla wow if you think what he said was overly controlling or assumed others were idiots.
---
If you mean do you stay stealthed when casting aimed shot:  that's a hard NO!  The minute you cast anything you come out of shadowmeld, that includes Eyes of the Beast.
---
Yeah, it’s called the Earnings Call for all Shareholders that gets reported by news outlets.
---
Imagine not adding tooltip numbers on spells and gear in an RPG because it would confuse players.
---
lol oh the things you've missed
---
&gt; because if you talk to most Arena players they would tell you..
---
Who are these?
---
I guess "the best arena seasons" can be highly subjective if you look at every arena player's opinion. But mentioning a WoD season over the TBC seasons seems weird.
---
Your healer's mana bar is as important as your own health bar.
---
or just kick you from the group
---
We used to do this too. I think we did the 45 minute baron with 4 people. Maybe you were just bad.
---
Not going to be as useful.
---
At a time or thought the whole leveling process? And that many at once at 60? That's a long time to conjure. I hope you are a good tipper. What was your tip amount?
---
I was pally, my friend was druid. Might have taken us a long time to get the kills, but we did. We almost never died, it was nearly impossible to out dps our survivability and we would clear entire zones world pvping. Some of the best fun I ever had playing any game, ever. He would lan at my house on the weekends, this was back in high school, and we would just world pvp all day
---
The raids are solid, but that about it.
---
Dungeons are *ok*, but pretty cancer with the M+ affixes.
---
Class design is rooouugghh, the bases of some classes are good, but they feel empty.
---
That's not the sole purpose of classic and it will never be. No change is a starting point, but if you'd listen you'd have seen devs are not closed to the idea of tbc or 1.14. If classic is popular, it won't stay popular if there's nothing after naxx. You think blizzard won't try to retain those millions when there is nothing to do in the game anymore?
---
The servers are regional. Like they've always been. Like they'll always be. Even in retail there's like 2-3 active guilds across hundreds of realms that raid during off-hours. 
---
You really don't know anything at all, do you? Why is it always those who know the least who are the loudest?
---
This is the second time somebody used this Narcos meme and doesn't know how to use it..
---
Because they're huge fucking cows with hoves, and would not be very sneaky.
---
I know basically no pro that liked it since PvE was a must for the trinkets or you are done so.
---
????
---
No ashole tanks who wipes runs.  
---
Setting expectations beforehand means less problems.  Letting them know that if they pull without my ok at &lt;50% mana they endure a repair cost penalty.  Is often enough to encourage them to look at my mana bar.  
---
Guild runs was another matter but for pugs that was the truth.
---
Very strange... almost as if you are upset you didn't get to play a beta that gets deleted when classic launches.
---
This is LITERALLY the only thing that's ever turned me off of Shaman.
---
In my opinion doing a roll back to vanilla is the first step to get a WoW I can enjoy again. And I'd really wish they would continue development (after WoW Classic has been played through) from what was existing in vanilla instead of working on the current modern WoW, which in my view is a waste of time.
---
WARLOCK WHY DIDN'T YOU FEAR?!?!?!?!?!?
---
What voice are you using? Is there one baked in?
---
be sure to clear extra pacts that people want to run by to avoid to "save time" 99% of the time those get accidentally pulled and that's the reason we wipe. the time saver squeeze by packs always get you killed
---
Dragon heads had cooldowns and songflower was one person click only, so no your experience was not in Vanilla, it's in your private server trash heap.
---
This. Without mage water, I'm not grouping with gogogogo people to heal. Fuck that noise. Not worth the expense or frustration of bad tanks that don't watch mana.
---
Only exception was I had a gogogog tank that would run over and hand me every major mana pot that dropped and even a few before the run started, so I just used those and let him do his Aspergers thing.
---
so you'll only beat them once a week?
---
I'm purposely rolling classes I've never really played before in Classic and going Horde.
---
This is literally how I picked my race and class. I read everything from the manual and chose Tauren Druid because I loved the Native American influence and the Druid class fantasy. It wasn’t based at all on racial abilities, end game role, specs, etc. Just plain old excitement for the class fantasy and flavour of the race. 
---
Only got to level 20ish before I made an alt and never looked back. I’ll be rolling Tauren Druid again and this time I’de like to continue all the way.
---
Lmao of course you can shadowmeld in combat. That's the entire point of the spell. Shadowmeld -&gt; prowl -&gt; drink is how I've done M+ since Legion
---
What's worse is that I'd feel bad if I went human caster. 5% int is just too good to pass up.
---
And then I think oh screw it.. horde instead lol
---
druid, mediocre class in every aspect unless you tryhard nolife it.
---
Yeah, since the client is new, it has voice comms. Check the settings.
---
Sorry, how come it won’t be in phase 1? I’m not too familiar with the phases. Isn’t dire maul a highish level dungeon that will be out in phase 1?
---
Oh shiet, twitch chat outside of twitch, cringe.
---
Maybe prot can be FC if someone else runs it? But that seems like too much of a theorycraft
---
I never played the original AV, but I'd like to try it. It would be cool if Blizz could do 2 versions. A "Short" or "Lite" version, which would be the 1.12 version, and a "Long" version, which would be the original. They could have both and let the community decide which one to keep, or even run them along side each other permanently. Although the latter would risk splintering the community, but honestly, they could adjust the amount of servers to fit both. Even if they made both for a month and then left it up to a vote as to which one to keep, I think it would be very interesting to see which version people liked better.
---
I would argue that in Vanilla Warrior is one of the more complex classes (fleshed out). 
---
Stance dancing, plenty of situational abilities, top DPS/tank, interesting talent specs.
---
5%\*
---
I'm in a similar life situation.. how do you figure 2 months for 60? Especially if only playing after 8pm? I'm assuming not everyday since will have to spend time with wife too!
---
Really? I contacted a GM and he told me it was not possible. I will call by phone to double check, thank you!
---
Going by that logic I guess we should all be backpedaling and clicking our spells again?  
---
Look, its two different things we're talking about now. The Classic experience wont be the same as back in 2004-2006 and theres nothing we or Blizzard can do to change that. It just wont be all the same and thats something we just have to accept.  
---
World buffs were in the game back then, so of course they should be in Classic as well. World buffs could be used in dungeons and raids, so of course it should stay like that.
---
What is wrong with it, out of interest?
---
/r/classicwowplus
---
Meh, get the hybrid balance&amp;resto spec and you can spam HT rank 3 and 4 for hours on end.
---
Think it was 21 in balance and the rest in resto. Been too long.
---
I’m torn between playing what I did back then, or trying something new. Don’t think I can give up redoing the epic hunter quest
---
Monkaw
---
Thanks for the info. My concern isn't gold per hour, just a challenge. Soloing raids was my hobby in wow, until they nerfed the crap out of it.
---
It’s the best pvp weapon obtainable before naxx, given that warrior is the best dps class and the most popular class, it’s gonna be hard to get by any standard.
---
&gt;S3 &amp; s5-8 are considered the best for most gladiator+ players I have talked to.
---
All those seasons were completely dominated by PvE gear.
---
&gt;I know basically no pro that liked it since PvE was a must for the trinkets or you are done so.
---
Liked the Cata seasons? Yeah they were pretty dominated by PvE gear at some points, but certainly no worse then most seasons that came before it.
---
They're fairly self explanatory. Some are better for DPS, some are best for healers. This link should give you a better breakdown [Vanilla Paladin Seals](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Seal_(ability)
---
For real: Say you're outta mana and cant heal, stay far back so you don't agro, sit your ass down, let him die, and then rez 'em.   
---
They learn real fast. Pointing out that the group icons show your mana helps too.
---
Exxxdiiiiiii
---
All of my friends are playing Horde...again...and I'm going alliance because I've seen enough Horde zones and I'm going to pick them off 1 by 1 ganking and post pictures of their corpses.  If I can find 2 more people, I almost wanna copycat the Ooga gang.
---
I once had a healer refuse to heal me because I life tapped.
---
I'm dreading rolling a warlock and ending up with a stupidly named demon. Something like Coksuk or Cumguz lol
---
so many polearms would be perfect for druids its another sad day for druids in vanilla
---
Warriors and rogues benefit much more from world buffs. Without them they're actually just slightly ahead of hunters/mages. But with them they do x2 more dps.
---
The pre-raid BIS set up.
---
Without raiding, there is PVP.  Eventually you max professions, get the cool stuff you want, etc.  But at endgame, there is raiding and PVP.  PVP is endless, can do it forever in theory.
---
The concept use to be you raided to be geared for PVP.  The best raiders had the best gear, therefore could be the best PVPers.
---
I don't like PVP that much, after a few BGs I am done.  After that, it's just putzing around.  Farming mats to min.max raid dps/tps/hps is the only thing that interests me.  The auction house alone is a sub-game for me as well.  Grinding gold through sales and auctions, so I can even bring more of a net benefit to my raid.
---
It's just fun to play wow.
---
&gt; I haven't seen any kind of constructive post in what could be a way
---
Then you are not looking very hard. This like the 10,000th post on this subject. People just are not interested in discussing it right now.
---
Stormwind doesn’t have enough raging bonfires.
---
That’s on of the reasons I’m choosing orc as race. Just not sure if I roll hunter or lock...
---
Make the time! Just gotta sleep less and ignore all other social obligations. Also, be efficient about leveling. Use add-ons and follow guides.
---
Oh I'm sorry, are you a memeologist?
---
But like what do you use? Seal of crusader makes you faster but do less damage. Is this a dps increase? Do I use this or seal of righteousness which gives bonus holy damage per hit?
---
Druids have never appealed to me.
---
2-3 active guilds per server, maybe. 2-3 Across hundreds? You're just trolling at this point. Judging by your post history, you spend most of your day sperging out on reddit, specifically this subreddit.
---
Enjoy the life where anyone who calls you out on being a sperg suddenly has a victim complex. My life is pretty great, but for some reason you feel the need to continually search my post history and try and attack me personally. It's super cringe.
---
While leveling I'd do it everytime I logged on and planned to play for more than 2 hours (mostly if I knew I was going to run a dungeon). Wand spec leveling has the least downtime but if you are blasting through healing spells and chugging waters it helps to save some gold. When leveling I usually look the cost of vendor water, and then tip half the vendor water cost per stack. At level 60 I usually just tip 1g. Unless I have a mage friend on. Then I just get it for free lol
---
Are turtles naturally resistant to spells? I remember them resisting alot more than regular mobs.  Could be wrong though
---
Uhm druids can and will tank the vast majority of 40man content, probably not main, but a lot of guilds will take a feral OT for sure.
---
3pm PST in the 26th, worldwide. It’s in their website.
---
What am I looking at? Are the entries different mobs?
---
There definitely was a cooldown. Cant remember if it was removed or not.
---
I know that if Ony/Nef's head was hanging up that the buff could not be reapplied
---
You can probably summon one for the luls but they're not much use. Ally buffs will make pve much easier.
---
Think the "problem" is more about the attitude. If the majority of guilds make it mandatory, then it will be a problem, irregardless of it being "worth". It IS a problem on private servers, I think time will tell if it will become a problem on classic. Might be worth waiting and seeing, if it does become a huge problem, they could poll if this suggestion is preferable.
---
Personally, I think world buffs weren't intended to be used as they are, and that they weaken the gameplay as is. Think Defcamp is quite rational in wanting this changed, to avoid this new way of playing becoming the standard.
---
To me it's always been annoying honestly. I get the shield bash and block in defensive stance, but some abilities like charge and hamstring seem needlessly convoluted.
---
Hahahaha, you admit to going through _my_ post history, and then accuse me of going through yours? Why the hell would I ever want to see more of your posts? Wow, I mean, at first I thought you were just trolling, but you're actually clinically insane, aren't you? You think people are following you around?
---
Get help. Professional help. For your own sake.
---
Well if you are maintenance, yes. If you do anything too wrong, everything crashes.
---
I just don't understand why the monthly sub is so low if micro transactions financial benefit influences development so much. Am I the only one that would gladly pay $40-50 a month for a great game free of micro transactional / vanity bullshit?
---
Not just any night elf huntar, night elf male with a moustache that back pedals, is the epitome of that huntard image for me , especially the ones that come with names like "lolgolas" " lêgôlâs " and "legolasqt".
---
So?
---
All I said it you have to stand still for auto. Which is 100% a fact. Yet my post gets downvoted. This subreddit has some of the sorriest idiots I have ever seen.
---
All pets were normalized in patch 1.9. Every pet is the exact same as all other pets in that family except for two things:
---
1. Character model/texture/color
---
2. Attack speed
---
Considering Flasks and consumables cost a bloody fortune, its likely in an effort to clear raids within 1 flask. Raiding isn't hard in classic, but you can easily run several hundred gold per raid per person. Especially on progress. Stacking world buffs is a response to that, and just the general desire to "speedrun" the content.
---
Hunter too, aspect of the cheetah ❤️
---
He isn't saying your DPS is 3% while 1% of it is from racial. He's saying 1% *of* the 3% is from racials. Very, very different.
---
I wasn't disputing the fact it could be done. The point still remains for stressing healers mana. If your tank/healer combo doesn't have the gear to mathematically mitigate/regen at the pace you're trying to make it's going to cost ONLY the healer a lot of wasted money drinking 1/10th of every drink. Has nothing to do with 'the vast majority of players completely sucking'
---
No they won’t. Any Fury Warrior with decent gear can OT just as well and won’t be completely useless during boss fights.
---
1% of 3% is 0.03%, not 1%
---
Undead rogue... do ppl not remember being stunlocked for 10 secs straight? If they have their cooldowns you’re just dead
---
150 gold at the end of what?
---
Diremaul is phase 2 since many rewards are better than MC items

So the water wont be available right away

Same goes fpr Paladin and Warlock epic mounts afaik

1% of 3% is .03%

No, AV is a good metric for AV. Large scale PvP doesn't happen with frequency (unfortunately).  If you judged from AV, then rogues are shitty and can't do anything but cap flags and die in huge shitstorms of people.  But a rogue picking his prey in 1v1 WPvP...totally different animal!
---
Dueling and WSG is probably a better indicator because if you're going to rank grind, you're going to play A LOT of WSG.  Even dueling you have to take with a grain of salt because in WPvP, initiative means everything and the formula is:  levels &gt; gear &gt; skill.
---
Then you have PvE which if you play AV on a mage, you really shine and you get to do all kind of cool stuff (pun intended!) but in a raid, you're gonna hit frostbolt and make people water.
---
TLDR: no
---
Human warrior for me always has seemed like the player is saying "yeh, i'm not into this fantasy thing you guys have going on here".
---
Won't there be a million shamans according to the polls?
---
Might be that I'm very jealous ;) But somehow I'm also thinking that this move was the best move Blizzard could do to kill private servers :D Because the one I played on is dying, and some others too, as I heard.
---
But ye, I'm okay. :)
---
I did it twice, once when I moved to England and once when I moved back.
---
I agree that it seems premature to consider something 2+ years in the future, but at the same time...one of the important aspects of development is considering the long-term: how sustainable is your project and how long will it maintain its audience/playerbase?
---
I'm sure these are questions the devs are asking themselves right now. If they're not way ahead of the curve in guessing these things, they'll see their hard work stagnate.
---
Obviously we can't predict exactly how long people will really be into Classic, or when they'll drop off for sure, or what the threshold will be for drop-off/playerbase retention, but going with current trends we can make educated guesses. The sad reality is that people can and will get bored of the game: the only question to answer is \*when\* that will occur. 
---
Again, seems silly for us to worry about it now, but I think it's on a lot of people's minds—and almost certainly is something the devs are talking about now.
---
\*cries in 2k\*
---
&gt;I remember rare/elite hunter pets having better stats/high lvl abilities etc
---
I won't be the case, in 1.12 the only difference between pets is their class and attack speed.
---
&gt;keeping a silver/gold dragon around their portrait when tamed
---
I don't think this is the case either.
---
Kinda makes sense on a season to season, expansion to expansion level too. Absolutely fantastic up until its third iteration which was its peak. Then it became worse and worse as it was made to be easier for casuals to understand what was going on, ruining all the minor details that made all the difference in order to streamline the experience for the casuals.
---
This entire thread is filled with:    
---
"I didn't watch the video. You all are idiots to want to disable this exploit in raids".  
---
And.   
---
"I watched the video, great points. WB meet the definition of exploit. Thus small change will preserve vanilla.".  
---
WB is a Game System that will NOT be used and Intended. = Exploit.    
---
Disable in raids. Everyone is happy.

People complain about Paladins having 5 minute buffs, but the totems are like 1 minute buffs at best sometimes. And you have to be very cognizant of where you are dropping them in relation to your party members.
---
I have Beta access and rarely play it. Mostly just to test addon development. My guild’s been using the account to test their routes.
---
Sorry but you clearly know nothing, a feral OT does a lot more dps then a prot in fury gear and a fury specced off tank will die a lot faster then a  feral OT in dire bear form. Idk where people get this hatred towards feral tanks from...
---
So far Spriest and Warlock/Rogue. I'm liking Spriest far more, but I do know that they aren't ideal to raid. I plan on joining a casual raiding guild a anyways so I don't think it'll be an issue. But, they do go oom soooo fast and that might get annoying
---
Lock is cool, but casting shadow bolts non stop might get pretty damn boring. And in PvP it's fun, but something just feels weird to me. I don't really like fucking with pets, and they seem incredibly gear dependant
---
Rogue is a lot of fun and was my original main so I was looking for something different this time around. That and there's like a million rogues so groups would be very hard to get I assume, so probably not rogue.
---
that's mostly due to pruning tbh
---
Dude you’re literally only destroying the game for yourself.
---
Classic is gonna be hell of fun. Your beta character will be gone after those 2 months whereas your classic character will be with you until you quit the game. (And still be there when you come back).
---
Just forget about beta and streamers and go outside, enjoy summer. Come back when autumn hits and classic releases and there’s nothing better to do than sit inside and play games.

Hunters.

I think what he is saying is not about complexity but fantasy. One is a human using a sword, which is not fictitious. The other is a warlock summoning demons while casting magic
---
Genious
---
It does matter. If there were a game warping exploit that wasn’t abused and fixed until BC, we should want it fixed in classic, right? The only argument against it would be “nochanges”, which loses any of its persuasiveness since removing said exploit would actually make the experience more like vanilla.
---
Now replace “exploit” above with world buffs.
---
Can't argue with the mage, but are you really ready to priest and be dependent on other people to help keep you alive healing in PvP and making money farming anything other than herbs and fishing, or go shadow and be OOM all of the time in PvP and not get raid invites?  Not saying priest isn't awesome, it's just a lot more painful than mage or hunter in terms of your independence and money making capabilities.
---
Yes, it just feels so weird with no moving auto shot, no cast bar aimed shot, and the deadzone feels so much larger than it did back then
---
I'm looking forward to playing horde. Played purely alliance in vanilla and retail so all the horde quests and zones are brand new.
---
What about argent dawn? Will that rep not be available on launch?

Meanwhile, my other posts have someone named Aodhyn replying, who totally isn't you.
---
Aodhyn: REEE REEE REEEEEE GET HELP REEEE

I get you just like arguing on the internet for no real reason, but why do you feel the need to continually try and judge my mental health based on a reddit post about classic wow? How convinced are you that doing that is even possible for someone who is licensed and gone to school?
---
Anyway, find someone else to sperg out on please.
---
I'd rather be botting and watching the screen than play paladin. In vanilla especially it looks like such a boring playstyle in conparison to any other class.
---
Also warrior because I've done the whole 'hitting people with a sword' thing in real life so it just has no appeal in game for me.
---
Dwarf mages were in the beta. Were removed because Alliance had too many options to where the Horde was very limited in terms of class choice per race. Although the people that had made Dwarf Mages already, were allowed to keep them for the remainder of vanilla beta.
---
Centuries old music with no copyright so your video won’t get the audio removed

I wouldn’t say completely true, Druid has a lot of aspects which are enjoyable. It’s also very fun playing a counter rogue build and watching tryhard rogues fail to get you past 80% hp whilst hitting them for big 500 damage mauls
---
Pretty accurate. I wish I was still as oblivious as back then.

 [**Patch 4.0.6**](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_4.0.6) **(8-Feb-2011):** Hunters can now use Auto Shot while moving.; Casting Trap Launcher, Distracting Shot, and Scare Beast now cancel Auto Shot when cast.

Yikes dude, trust me it doesn't sound cool at all when you say it outside twitch, you just look like an idiot . :p

Dude mages are so clutch in classic. Portals, food, CC.. Fuck I might have just convinced myself to roll a mage.
---
I cant freaking play anything else now, that's why I want beta. But I'm far from desperate.
---
As someone who will be an orc warrior when it comes out, thanks for these posts! I really appreciate it. This information is great, Iove knowing more about it before it hits, I'm really nervous. Even if it turns out to be different I love the history lesson. I think I mostly plan to be a raider, but I also want to dip into world pvp and might even do competitive pvp. Of course, I'll need a healing friend to be max potential, being a warrior and all, but it's my favorite class and race so it's what I'll be. I look forward to your following posts!
---
If you're curious whether you'll like raid healing, I STRONGLY recommend trying out a game called "little healer"
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3hrgp5/little_healer_wow_healer_simulator_nostalgia/
---
For a mobile app, it's a surprisingly good recreation of the feel of healing a raid.  I was caught off guard by how well it captured the experience.  
---
If you like this game you'll probably like healing, and if you don't, you probably won't.
---
As an example,  on my last lock I was 300 tailoring around level 40
---
Well some pets have unique abilities, not all bird are the same etc. there are definitely ones that are better to get than others
---
but runescape isnt free?
---
That depends, you got that level 55 gold.
---
Consecration is 10-15% of your overall dps and is part of your single target rotation.  Good ret pallies spam consecrate and mana pots.
---
I’m gonna play my human pally from retail and now pretend this is his adventures where he was just starting and truly learning how to be good and now he’s hardened in retail
---
As a mage this is why I give 60 water to the healer and to the other casters. I know its a lot but I can go through 60 water because of microsipping in a SM Cath run easily. 
---
You go through them FAST when you are drinking only 3-7 seconds here and there, but it helps overall downtime. At the same time though summoning 180 water for me, the healer and the Hunter is a pain in the ass when the level caps in beta are hard 0's, because you cast 2 at a time.

Calling worldbuffs an exploit is the most retarded thing I've heard on the internet this week, and it's been a busy week.

Thanks for this detailed writeup. I'm planning on going 20/31/0 at endgame to heal casual raids and tank 5-mans.
---
Can I ask you to go into more detail about stats for 5-man tanking? Do I predominantly want Stam/Int/Spelldamage? What about Defense, Mana/5, Strength? Is the Deathbone set any good? Or maybe just a few pieces of it?
---
Rogue. Reason - getting ganked endlessly by them in Hillsbrad Foothills years ago when I first started playing left me with a loathing of the class.

This subreddit truly is trash and its so obvious nobody here gives a shit about true and correct information. It's just a giant circle jerk where idiots upvote whatever already has a bunch of upvotes and downvote what already has a bunch of downvotes.

Truly a hillarious study in how absolutely dumb the average person truly is.
---
Partially true, but all birds *can learn* the abilities available to birds.
---
Yes if people can't control themselves and feel like they have to use them I suppose Blizzard could step in but I don't think that's a good path to go down. Private server guilds will either be spread out across multiple servers or clumped up on a handful of servers, it will be pretty difficult to push some kind of meta on the general playerbase that have no interest in juicing up to beat trivial content.
---
I'm pretty sure it does not do anything for being dazed.
---
How good a season was, isn't solely determined by how much PvE gear you needed to compete for rank1.. Never seen anyone rank how good a season was in terms of how many PvE pieces was BiS in PvP.
---
Pretty much every season in the first expansions had some type of PvE BiS for many classes.
---
I'll agree with s5 being absolutely terrible with DK's. But WOTLK seasons got a lot better after that.
---
40-50 is pushing it, but i will - and frequently do when the option actually exist - buy a game outright rather than all the micro transac bs. The price has to be right and the content good though. More reasonable would be a doubling or trippling of the sub, i believe that would be plenty - but if it came down to it, i would much rather pay 100$ a month for a genuinely good game with integrity towards gameplay first than play shitty diluted games for free.
---
I'm not good at healing, and I don't enjoy the gameplay of a healer. So I don't really want to practice or play one.
---
You want tremor not grounding, I /played over 200 days on a shaman in vanilla, and grounding never worked on aoe fears. Get your facts straight and stop freaking out about shit you know nothing about

I don't know, having to log out and wait to preserve my buffs sounds pretty meh to me. And even though I don't really mind much, if WB are gonna be in raids or not, I'd rather personally see them disabled there We'll see.
---
Must admit it was dumb of blizz not to release during summer in the business sense. Like won’t it just ruin everyones time when we have to play when we have stuff to do. At least give us 3 months of enjoyment..Jesus
---
I remember in the old days... healing and hitting 70, then getting Azol'nerub and watching so many tanks with pure pvp honor gear ungemmed, unchanted, no mitigation.. running in and pulling all 3 watchers.
---
Then blame the healer who was desperately healing binary and watching a watcher wrap him...
---
Convinced me to roll my priest as shadow from then on.
---
Yeah that is expected that we will not be in complete sync. and I even said above that we just wanted to stay in the same level range.  2-3 levels
---
The caps I mentioned are just the monthly goals I was asking for assistance with allocating lvl 1-60 into
---
it was very popular on release actually. The rest of your statement I agree with, but it's also a very different type of game. It didn't have gated release content scheduled at launch so of course people would quit once they hit end game. Tons of people would quit Classic too if they stopped development at MC and Onyxia.

the A:H ratio is going to be so, so different than original

Problem with enhancement is you pull aggro without any way to dump threat and you are squishy enough to not live very long getting hit by raid level bosses or trash.  Enhancement can do really good damage but it really is a nightmare to manage and you can expect to die a lot.
---
Sure it's 80/20 class trying to be single dimensional, but if you use your complete toolset it's 100%. Does require gear, but don't other classes like warrior and warlock...

The PvE Content IS already easy, so there is not that big Advantage. Dunno. People have so much Problems with real Classic. Makes me sad. If they remove World Buffs for Top Guilds then I want 200 Stacksize :-(

Snowballs were the greatest thing ever, and should be in AV year round! My favorite thing was that you could chain them. One person hits, then the other hits while they're flying away. You get a second bounce that launches them even higher. Pure awesomeness.

Bottom line:  spec and gear for leveling when you are leveling and keep role-specific gear if you tank or heal, you can still play your role just swapping out gear. Maybe think about switching at 58 to grind 5s for your prebis.

I wouldn't say I'm adamant about post-Naxx content (I liked BC and Wrath a lot and I'd be cool with them getting released next), but I'm of the opinion that retail has gone straight to hell and cannot be salvaged. I thought Legion was a bad expansion on top of WoD which was a bad expansion. BfA has also been terrible thus far; they lost me in the first two weeks kind of bad.
---
I'd argue they had some reasonable ideas with terrible execution, but it goes deeper than that. I honestly think post-Naxx content could be good for the game (kind of a WoW2, if you will). Releasing TBC and Wrath means going down the same exact path we've already been down, and where do you draw the line and say "the game ends here!"—is it after Wrath? Cata? MoP? There are people who loved all of these expansions. Heck, Cata seems pretty great to me personally compared to WoD/Legion/BfA!
---
Post-Naxx content means building on a good foundation that, if kept true to, could produce high quality experiences for the playerbase. OP seems in favor of small tweaks to talents, legitimate hybrid balance (not homogenization, balance: where hybrids get to do more than one thing and exist for that purpose, not as healbots), etc. Retail didn't tweak these things: they steamrolled it hard. Clearly if OP is here in a classic subreddit, he or she isn't on the retail bandwagon for a good reason.
---
That said, I want to play devil's advocate: at least we know what we're getting with TBC and Wrath. Any WoW2 or Classic+ content would be a dice roll—or at least, it would feel like one. Maybe the writing would be great! Maybe the content would be the best yet! But it could also go the way of BfA very quickly, too. Leaving things completely up to developers who are leashed to marketing departments? Maybe not the best choice.
---
I'm fully open to post-Naxx content creation, but my biggest fear is that it ends up being a huge mistake and we would have been better off getting TBC instead.

..... but if you get world buffs for the entire raid (which maybe you don't I guess?) then why not just start the actual raid 20-30-40? minutes earlier?  You would be more or less requiring everyone to get on early so everyone can get world buffs at the same time anyway ...  Saying raid starts at 6 but everyone make sure to show up at 5:30 for world buffs is basically the raid starting at 5:30.
---
I pull now, good luck everybody else.
---
No all pets are the same, only diffrance is the skin colors
---
Warlock. Throughout every xpac it has been top tier in both PvE and PvP, and it is utterly boring and pointless. 
---
If you play a Warlock you are literally accepting your entire gameplay involves standing in one spot and pressing 4 buttons over and over.
---
It's more about the experience that Blizzard gives during the beta and won't be available after release anymore. Doesn't happen that often, that there's a revamp of such an old and vast mmorpg.

It was in vanilla? Then keep it in classic.
---
This balancing horse shit people keep trying to put into classics atmosphere is retarded.
---
Play BFA if you want balancing changes in classic... or shut up and play :)
---
I always wanted to play a paladin in vanilla as a horde player. The terrible leveling turned me off from it then I found out they just heal and buff late game and lost interest.
---
IDK man, I tank a lot in WoW.  People expect me to know every pull and how to pull it.  It is really that much that I ask a healer to also know every pull and to already be in position, sitting and drinking, by the time I've made the next pull?  I expect no less of myself when I'm healing.
---
Is the consensus that the Vanilla Add-ons will work with Classic? 
---
It seems like the streamers are using the same ones from 1.12 p-servers.
---
Gosu? Same name as a gnome DK that ran though Forge of Souls nekkid. Best run ever. Co-inkydink?
---
So you're guild doesn't want to enjoy vanilla? :( Everything has to go fast nowadays. Or what is meant by "routes"?
---
Sad, once someone calls you out on how shit your argument is, you simply block them.
---
There used to be a pretty popular guild called &lt;The Enclave&gt; that only allowed humans and they still took the fantasy aspect as seriously as anyone else. I get that that's the exception to the rule, but I felt they were worth mentioning all these years later.
---
Followed by a wipe and "why didn't you watch your mana?"

No... Smooth McGroove...the grooviest of smooths... HOW COULD HE DO THIS TO POOR WOLF... I feel Betrayed™...by my own side... No true honor.

My friends want to play Alliance.. Otherwise I'd go undead warlock for sure.
---
Female Night Elf Priest. Reasons? Appearance and sweet sweet casting animations. Fear Ward just isn’t worth having to be a Dwarf. At a push I could go female Dwarf as the casting animations aren’t too dissimilar from female Nelfs (two hands straight up in the air on heal completion). But there’s a lot of time to go, could change my mind dozens of times by then..
---
On ultimate settings
---
I only played as a lock during legion, is the same concept as back then?
---
Sure, if gear is equal. If the person opening on you has even slightly more gear, then you're basically dead. Always been like that. Or if they open, cheap shot, cold blood evis, you're probably dead as well.
---
Yeah it’s the bladestorm icon
---
Would you or anyone be upset if it was closed and they weren't allowed to stream?
---
How is it any different? 
---
Millions of subs and only ~10k testers... not players... testers.
---
&gt; And the answer we've arrived on is that server infrastructure, graphic (but not model &amp; texture) and UI changes are acceptable, but gameplay and balance changes are not.
---
The beta already has gameplay changes to what most people call \#nochanges. Starting from melee leeway, over to pets and simulated spell batching. All those are very different to how things worked on private servers which is what most people based their \#nochages off of.
---
Saying some gameplay changes (have you noticed the wand discrepancy after instant casts?) are okay but not others is just incosistent.
---
That's totally okay, but that leads to no ability to discount proposed changes out of hand.
---
It's part of it. 4/5 4/8 glaive ruined s4. I didn't play Wotlk arena past s5 because s5 was such trash it turned me off it completely.
---
Why don't you answer the question?
---
Also, who suggested playing a better spec is more fun?
---
I'm sure the private server scene will always have people, but once Classic releases they'll be dead comparatively speaking. At least with Classic you know your stuff won't randomly end up deleted or whatever.
---
Most efficient way?  Get a paladin to pull everything in SM and AoE it down and repeat until you're level 40 or so. After that mob tagging. You only get 50% from mob tags now but still fast.
---
Most vanilla healers were terrible.  
---
You would look at the healing meters afterwards and like 80% of their healing was just overhealing.
---
Down rank your heals and you won't be OOM.
---
I'd just fireblast the next pull while we were still in combat and blame it on hunter pet multi-shot.
---
There are voice comms?
---
There're LFM Mondays on this subreddit, and I think posting a guild ad as a separate thread might be against the rules.
---
&gt; To remove world buffs is a BIG FUCKING CHANGE.
---
Who said they should be removed? The video talks about them being automatically displled if you enter a raid instance.
---
Outside will do you some good friend
---
&gt; It should be BASIC knowledge by now.
---
It should be. But people on here continually spread misinformation and it gets upvoted heavily.
---
I'd have to agree with you there! I guess my point was that it's not always 100%, too many variables etc
---
Rogue. Sneaking around and being scum don't fit me.
---
We're planning a week one Ragnaros kill. Have to get the /played to 60 to under 100 hours.
---
This is what we enjoy, speedleveling, speedkilling, speedrunning, etc. It's the only hardcore mode left in Vanilla.
---
Decursive and threat meter.
---
Boomkin tanks, on the other hand..
---
Pretty sure they are still around and have been on and off again with WoW. No idea if they plan on coming back for classic but they did start allowing non human races in late vanilla if memory serves.
---
So because your 'top-tier guild' wasn't try-hard enough to use world buffs in vanilla, the Wow Classic game code should be changed to make sure everyone else models the way you chose to play the game 14 years ago?  That is absolutely ridiculous and you know it.
---
Interesting, didnt know this one, thanks :)
---
I like your answer :) You're totally right. Unfortunately, I'm the kind of guy who don't know what to do outside. xD And I can't efford a dog, yet. :( But that's another story. \^\^

Thanks :) i was quite caught up in the whole priest is the best healer line that is so prevalent.
---
There's no way you've been on this sub since the release date. And also I comment this everytime someone asks for hybrid balance, how would you do it. Its not just as simple as "tuning the numbers" Those classes don't have gear statted properly for them. Additionally you buff ret, ele, boomkin what happens in pvp. Some hybrids are nuts in pvp like Ele and spriest whats your solution to that.

Wasn't it also the case that you couldn't summon people from Kalimdor to EK? I vaguely remember something like that, given they are separate instances it would make sense.
---
No one gives a shit about what happens on a private server.
---
AFAIK the WoW API Is still based on Lua version 5.1.
---
I play apex but like all BR’s I’m bored after an hour of playing. No progression, no goals, the cosmetics are boring at best. What’s the point? The running and shooting is fun but there’s just nothing to really strive for
---
&gt; Just because you describe his comment as being fallacious, doesn’t mean he’s wrong.
---
I didn't say he is wrong. I said his argument is invalid. That's pretty big difference. The argument in my post is that using slippery slope has no informational content inside a discussion.
---
For me saying he is wrong, I would have to field some arguments (which I didn't in this post).
---
&gt; in this case of the slippery-slope we have existing precedent - this company has already taken the slippery slope.
---
And we also have 2 precedences that the company
---
* reverted changes that are part of the slippery slope argument chain
---
* has publically stated that they want to recreate the feeling of classic, and that this recreation includes gameplay
---
&gt; he’s perfect right to be concerned.
---
Sure. In the same way as Defcamp is concerned in the OP video that World Buffs will have a negative impact on the raiding scene in classic.
---
Because its not me suggesting that and I'm focusing on the arrogant part.
---
&gt; Why is playing moonkin and ret paladin more fun than playing a good spec?
---
You are implying it. Very clearly.
---
Yeah as much as I like the idea of totems and the class quests, I really don’t think I want to do that for the entirety of endgame.
---
Might have a alt shaman though.
---
Not that expensive.. I’ve been doing fine
---
I'll probably roll an Undead Mage, but I can't see all the appeal for Undead. Why do people like them so much?
---
So the buffs people use for raiding weren't intended to help with raids, is that what the problem is? I mean some of the world buffs are just annoying to get, I think that's a natural counterbalance to them first of all. I mean playing the game not exactly as intended is what leaves room for players to shine in certain ways and it's part of the fun too. Is using 20 dapper charges to kill a group of people instantly an exploit? Certainly it's not fair to the people being shit on, but then again those people out the time into engineering to be able to do that. I see no problem. Is using a bunch of odd items in a 1v1 to win an exploit? Idk man if you want nice things &amp; tricks just put in the time for them.
---
Some of us enjoy trying to level fast. The race to 60 of only going to happen once, but you can always roll an alt to take your time and smell the roses later.
---
What is your feeling to improved graphics, bnet integration and other obvious changes to the game?
---
Human/dwarf Priest/Paladin. Started flip flopping again...
---
Hence the part after the word “even”. But you also know what they say about being technically correct...
---
Does that mean **Lupos** and **Broken Tooth** are no different than other typical tameable pets within the same family in patch 1.12?
---
At some point Lupos dealt Shadow Damage which made him amazing, but if he is normalised he isn't a particularly desirable pet any more.
---
The other choice was **Broken Tooth**, who had the lowest attack speed for a pet in the in the game of 1.0 seconds, doesn't mean Broken Tooth will have the same Attack Speed as as other cats?
---
I  don't really mind, since I'd rather not have to camp taming them, but that will change things a little.
---
&gt; They have specifically said that their goal is to replicate vanilla as it was in 1.12
---
That is not really what they said though. They said they want to recreate the vanilla feeling and are using 1.12 data as a reference point.
---
If someone finds AV too long they can just, not play AV.
---
I'd prefer the epic version instead of the watered down one.
---
Very few people would pay a $40-50 for a subscription, and you can bet that Blizzard have done their research on what people are willing to pay.
---
Just amazing commentary. You'd really have to be one of the cool kids to get this.
---
But you'd have to be one of the kids who were repeatedly dropped on their head to post or upvote it.
---
How do you balance those hybrids? Classes like spriest and ele shaman are already insanely good in pvp you buff them to be more viable in pve and then what they're even better in pvp? You guys don't understand the ramifications of what you're asking. 
---
And like you said sure post Nax content COULD be great, but its a coin flip that most people arent willing to take.
---
 I'm totally down with this, I also think #nochanges is a theoretical impossibility anyway
---
Oh sorry I wasn't aware of this! Thanks for the tip :)
---
HEMA practitioner?
---
Expliot has a very specific meaning in the context of a game.  
---
Walljumping to an area you could not normally reach, and attacking players while simultaneously preventing them from reaching you, retaliation or guards helping is an exploit.   
---
Acquiring buffs that are available to all, but only require time is no more an exploit than using flasks or E'ko.   
---
You **can** make the argument that removing world buffs upon entry to a raid makes things more balanced, or fair, or is even more true to the experience, but what you can't really do is suggest that using them is exploitation.
---
Locks look legit like Gul'dan with t1/2/R13 gear
---
Hm, kay. Everyone what he likes most. I hope I hit 60 in 3-4 months xP
---
Did you read my post? Attack Speed wasn't normalized until the pre-TBC patch. Broken Tooth is *the* pet for WoW Classic.
---
&gt; Microsoft figured out mobile better than anyone else
---
iPhones and Androids - thousands are selling right now, Windows Phone - literally dead. Yes. Microsoft figured it out. Deep.
---
Sounds like you are the one who haven't paid attention. The core pillar on classic is authenticity, they specifically said that. They have never talked about a "1.14", all they said was that they were open to the idea of tbc, AFTER Classic is over. But these are two seperate things, I don't know why you are mixing this up with changes to Classic??
---
Yeah, I’m fully with you against balancing in Classic; it’s not needed or wanted, and cuts against the point of this project.
---
But I can also see how Blizzard would view World Buffs not as an issue of balance but of gameplay. They may feel that it is antithetical to the MMO they created to have chunks of players “storing” their world buffs offline for days at a time (even more likely to occur with increased cooldowns on head turn-ins). 
---
Blizzard also has a financial interest in prolonging Classic’s already-simple-by-modern-standards content. They may take any angle they can get to be able to avoid trivializing endgame PvE further.
---
Sorry for asking a genuine question about a game that I don't know too much about. I personally don't spend all my time browsing wow classic forums and I never played vanilla. Sorry for being clueless about a game I've technically never played.
---
Time to make some macros that say those things and its easy
---
You'll want engineering for the dps boost and utility.
---
It's almost always done by druids at high level, not just because of travel form's speed boost but all of their other forms too — cat can stealth up to the flag and sprint indoors, bear can tank massive damage, all of them are immune to most common forms of CC.
---
But besides just being a druid flag running has a lot to do with mind games. Everyone is alerted to you grabbing the flag but your position isn't live-updated on their maps — the point being a straight line from their base to yours is usually a bad idea. You want to juke the defenders by hugging either flank or sometimes doing nothing at all, carrying their flag to some obscure spot in their base until they've scrambled enough to leave an opening. If your jukes fail and you get caught in a zerg vs zerg you're mostly at the mercy of your teammates.
---
If your flag is taken you're unable to cap, in which case you want to be at the ready somewhere in your base (usually the roof) with at least a few teammates standing as bodyguards, preferably hunters and rogues.
---
Perplexity's latest video is a great example of high level WSG and while he doesn't flag run you get a taste of a lot of the tactics involved. Sorry I don't have a good vid of the druid perspective at hand.
---

---
tell that to the BoSacing/BoFing/BoPing paladin keeping the lock out of any melee harms way, while the warlock is THE caster counter class with tongues, felhunter etc.
---
There is reason why warlocks are considered superior in a alliance premade in comparison to a horde prem.
---
Fears, corruptions get insta dispelled while the paladin keeps the warlock as mobile as a mage.
---
Distract stops your movement though, so this person hit W after the distract.
---
Used to do this on the chain in BRM, much more satisfying when people land in lava 😉
---
Human Warrior
---
Only got 3 search results when searching for WoW Classic, like I said I just recently made an account to post this. I have replicated it a more appropriate forum now too though after I was given some help :)
---
Yup way too many
---
100% this.  If you care so much about your DPS rankings vs players in other guilds/servers and speedruns, then you'd better be prepared for the monotony of stacking world buffs and praying you don't get ganked on the way to the instance.
---
No changes
---
Those Spriest tanks tho
---
https://youtu.be/J7siEh7-aZ8
---
&gt; But i want to know which class need maybe less skill to be successfull in pve/pve.
---
Definitely paladin. In PVE, you buff people and you spam 1 or 2 heal buttons for the rest of the raid. In PVP, you buff people and you spam 1 or 2 heal buttons for the rest of the BG unless you're being attacked, then you bubble and spam 1 or 2 heal buttons for the rest of the BG.
---
Most raids do not need a pure Shadow Priest, they can just get 1 of the Holy Priests to spec down Shadow to get Shadow Weaving for the shadow damage buff. I've said this before in many other posts that Shadow Priest damage should be measured in Gold Per Second because of how many consumables you have to chug to keep it going. In reality a Shadow Priest is one of the least needed specs in the game for raid content :( I will still be playing a Shadow Priest because that is my #1 favorite class in the game since 04 launch. That being said I expect a real struggle trying to progress in raid content as a Shadow Priest. I will probably have to respect to Holy before ever raid just so I'm not an anchor for my team.
---
I don't know, was it? You could view it differently and say people need more time because they can play less and therefore will be subbed longer? ;)
---
I have played every class, but I never stick with the cloth wearers. I just get bored, it's not even the roll, I'll heal on druid, shaman, or paladin if need be. Just don't like clothies.
---
That’s a really well put argument; if Blizzard uses this reasoning I would have no problem with them keeping world
---
buffs for raiding. The longer cooldowns on head turn-ins may already be enough.
---
Getting defensive? All I said is that you sounded like a primadonna healer... And your reply really cements it in there.
---
As a priest, I come to a dungeon and do my job. Ask for something if you need it, but don't cause wipes out of spite... What are you 8?
---
Hunters have come a long way since the OG huntards in '04. People know how to play them now and they're quite solid in vanilla. If you still think hunters are huntards then you probably don't know how to play one at a high level. At the end of the day all classes are simple in classic. But they all do have varying levels of skill cap.
---
Mage or hunter for me
---
I never said I used world buffs in Vanilla like they do in pservers and Classic will have the original cooldown on dragon heads.
---
As I said, if it was in Vanilla it should be in Classic.
---
Your oppinion doesn't matter (and neither should mine) on what should or should not be in Classic.
---
It's as simple as looking at something and asking, was it in Vanilla? If yes, it should be in classic, that simple, if it wasn't in Vanilla it shouldn't be in classic. The only room for discussion is if something had different versions.
---
Exceptions to this are obviously game breaking things like reckoning, DI exploit in BWL (even though that was never fixed in Vanilla) and things like that.
---
Shut up with that realism nonsense. Standing 10 feet away and crouching down doesn't make you sneaky either but you'd never dare question the logic of a person being literally invisible until they're in stabbing range. Rogues, like most things in warcraft, are magic. Magic doesn't need justification.
---
Damn that is pre smart, never thought of it like that. Except come on they need to give some love to the community lmao. They gonna be ruining careers lol
---
Human warrior is the same why people play the imperial guard in Warhammer 40k.
---
It's very immersive for some to be exactly what they would be themselves when being put in any real world scenario.
---
Most likely you are some frontline grunt who gets 3-6months of basic training to get shipped off to the battlefield where you eventually get battle hardened or you perish.
---
Only a select few become mages as they probably are taken into school at 5years of age to begin a life time of learning. 
---
You - a warrior - a conscript who survives against the odds to rise above others.
---
&gt; Because its not me suggesting that and I'm focusing on the arrogant part.
---
Well, you're either suggesting that or that people who want to play trash specs are retarded, there's no third option, so I just went with the nicer version.
---
&gt; You are implying it. Very clearly.
---
No, what I'm implying is they're equally fun, because literally 0% of your enjoyment of the game comes from spec, class or race selection.
---
Are you literally unable to tell the difference between saying x is not greater than y and saying y is greater than x?
---
Druid Healer is actually my preferred healer for exactly the reason you mentioned. Thorns. Retpala is also great if you can find it for 10% increased Holy Damage which does wonders for your threat. A Paladin in the group also means you get both Judgement of Wisdom and Judgement of the Crusader.
---
As far as gearing is concerned there's a lot of options. No matter what you do I would prioritize Stamina until you get a good enough amount that you wont die to burst damage and that healers can have some breathing room to heal other players. Nothing is worse than healing a tank with so low HP that he'll drop dead if you stop healing for a few seconds.
---
Secondly you want some intellect. Running out of mana is really bad. You suddenly wont be able to keep Holy Shield up. You cannot recast seals, and you cannot consecrate or Cleanse. Get enough Int that you feel confortable that your mana can last you through a pack of mobs, a boss, or an asspull. In my experience you dont need much. Using a couple pieces of Lawbringer or Judgement gear like Head/Legs (in early patches) should be enough. If you just hit 60 there's some items you can use like Blood of the Martyr (15 stam, 10 int ring from a quest in Stratholme), or a shield like the quest shield from killing Nathanos Blightcaller. Also 15 stam 10 int.
---
Spelldamage boost your threat. Getting some when you can is preferred, but not at the expense of stamina or int in my opinion. If you can get a Briarwood Reed and maybe a Spellpower Ring you should be good for early tiers.
---
Deathbone is quite okey. It gets you defense, stam, and some mp5. The mp5 can be nice for when you are oom, trying to get enough mana back for a Seal of Wisdom. I personally find the set to lack in stam and int so I wont use them for 5mans myself. Typically you can handle taking crits in 5 mans, and through Reckoning you will be doing a lot more threat that way and also regen more mana with Judgement of Wisdom up when you get crit for additional attacks.
---
Strength is in my opinion not that great. You take it when you can get it, but you need 20 strength for 1 Block Value, and your white damage is not boosted by Righteous Fury. Take it where you can get it without sacrificing other stats.
---
When it comes to Paladin tanking though, even more important than your overall gearsetup is your choice of weapon. Because you are limited by mana, then regenerating and keeping your mana up should be the number one priority to reduce downtime.
---
My choice for this is to get a fast weapon like f.ex Flurry Axe (1.5 speed). Because Seal of Righteousness scales with weapon speed, it will do the same threat per second whether you have a fast or slow weapon. The scaling from spellpower is also just a flat 10% of SP no matter your speed, which means faster weapons actually do more threat once you start getting SP.
---
But more important than any of this is that the procrate of Judgement of Wisdom is independent of weapon speed. Against a judged target, your attacks have a 60% chance to restore 59 mana. The judgement is also triggered by Seal of Righteousness, which means every attack against a judged target has a 60% + 60% chance of restoring 59 mana. A fast weapon will mean a lot more returned mana over the course of a fight.
---
If you can coordinate this with your group then mark a target in any group of mobs that will be left alone until everything else is dead, judge it with wisdom, and start hitting it with SoR while letting your return damage and consecration build threat on the other mobs. You can see this way of playing in the video I linked in my previous post.
---
Anyway this got a lot longer than I intended. I hope it answered your questions, and if there's anything else then feel free to ask.
---
Rep will be available at launch, and the Enriched Manna Biscuits will as well.
---
Well said. Glad that not everyone think intended game mechanics &amp; design choises are exploits.
---
Because there were no blood elves or nightborn
---
Hunter for me too. The micromanaging required to play it optimally is completely absurd.
---
i'm not a hunter or a warlock and i'm complaining about it. pretty much not true.
---
Yeah I’ve battled with all of the above. I’d really rather do shadow and PVP but all of that scares me away from it. Feel like I’d just be poor all the time.
---
That’s why I roll 2 toons.
---
I don't see why blizzard would expect classic to give them a massive boost to subs past 6 months.
---
March of 2020 is going to be a different landscape for sure since more people will be playing Classic than BFA but they aren't going to just ignore BFA and next years expansion.
---
As we get closer to the date I feel like I'll be spending a lot less time in Classic than I originally anticipated.
---
It's the best version of wow and I'll never play retail again when Classic launches - I just don't see me spending 100 hours in a month on Classic when games like Cyberpunk release.
---
Then again I don't plan on having one of every class at 60 and in raiding gear. 
---
I just want 1 level 60 with epic mount and enough gold to keep up with consumables while waiting for raid night(s) :)
---
It's AV beta on a test character. Just playing around. Not everything has to be optimal.
---
&gt;I always told tank if my mana &lt;50% and you pull I let you die.
---
Jesus what a baby you are. Just roll dps and leave healing to us folks who aren’t this terrible
---
And attack speed.
---
Yea i know the pally. But i csnt decide between shaman and druid. Holy pally seems for be the best protectic heal class in overall but i want to have some dmg output also
---
World buffs arent an exploit, they are a intended part of the game. Comparing them world buffs to exploits is jus silly.
---
Or are you saying Nihilums world first is illegitimate because they used world buffs?
---
&gt; here is a reason why transmog items are expensive in retail, why transmog got implemented in the frst place
---
Yea, people don't realize how little time they spend looking at their character.
---
If you want the easy way out, you're no Horde of mine.
---
Like right. I’m a pally so it’s easier but I’ll be healing with like 5% mana cause letting my tank die is so stupid. Some people man.
---
Exactly, catering to all these people who want to make the game more convenient is the exact reason why retail started to suck.
---
Next up, "Blizzard the RNG of boss drops makes it too long to get gear, can we have tokens instead?"
---
We're all older with more responsibility now, I am not going to be no-lifeing it for world buffs.  If somebody wants to do it, or a guild wants to require it, let them.
---
That just means those guilds aren't the right fit for you.
---
It's absolutely shitty that he wants Blizzard to handicap other players because he doesn't want to make the sacrifices they will.
---
I guess you'd hold hundreds worth but I dont remember us using a mounts worth of pots even in naxx all night attempts.
---
Are you sorting by lvl required to wear? Quest items dont have a lvl requirement and are at the bottom of the list below lvl1 stuff
---
Which is perfectly acceptable and I don't ever plan on playing retail after Classic releases - I just don't see myself running multiple characters through raids each week... I just want my main 60 with epic riding and enough gold to supplement consumables.
---
Too many other games to play :)
---
They specifically said that the core pillar on Classic is authenticity. Removing or restricting world buffs and things like that would have a crucial effect on authenticity.
---
to be honest , no , orgri doesnt looks like that , it has its own "barrens" [style](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2spifXWQiyE/UVxQ1VP6W1I/AAAAAAAACS4/mcpCjUo3xSg/s1600/WoWScrnShot_110210_204027.jpg) , it doesnt looks like  post-apocalyptic destroyed city
---
Are you talking about low-level PvP? Because at 60 I don't think Mages particularly enjoy going up against Hunters of any sort, especially not beast master.
---
Rallying cry of the Dragonslayer, it gives 5% crit to physical attacks and 140 melee attack power
---
&lt;pikachu face&gt;
---
&gt;You basically said the Beta is the real game, and official launch is pointless.
---
You seem like a master in just reading what you want to read. Do you give lessons?
---
&gt; You aren't even going to play because u didn't get beta? 
---
I'll take a look into it, as I still have a WoW token. And then we'll see. I fear that the community might not be like it was back then or is on private server (just a new thought that came into my mind).
---
I scoured the databases for daggers and swords. There is literally nothing until hypnotic blade. Seems your best option is to just equip with the best “of the eagle” , “of the owl”, “of intellect”, or “of stamina” item you can get til hypno blade.
---
For real, you gotta strike a compromise between being an idiot and being overzelous.
---
As a healer a little bit of mess is fun.
---
I understand completely what I’m asking. It wouldn’t be an easy process and would require a lot of little tweaks and manpower for testing to get to the point where it’s actually somewhat balanced. Unfortunately Blizzard’s track record making these kinds of changes is, uh, bad. So I lump it in with post-Naxx content: it would also be a coin flip and maybe not be worth it.
---
Sorry but your argument doesn't make any sense.  You proved once again that you just don't know what we are talking about here.
---
ITT i realize i have a weird emotional attachment to all the icons and im mad at OP for making fun of them
---
I think I agree with you with the sap combo being the a good play. I prefer playing with a hemo build, so my counterattack on the dwarf rogue if I get a stun resist would be - immediate vanish into CS, hemo, gouge, KS, hemo, hemo, rupture, then kite him into another restealth/CS. At this point he will probably use stoneform to cancel the crippling poison and rupture, because if he doesn't, you will have a very good chance of winning. If he DOES, you can still restealth, but he will also restealth, and the fight will be a soft reset - now however you will be free to use blind on him for the remainder of the fight. If you are too close during the kite he may also try to blind you.
---
The reason AV is short is because people don't like doing it for anything other than the rewards.
---
On the beta you have a bunch of level 58's in blues and greens with no incentive (or even ability afaik) to get rewards from the AV and who will be deleted in just a few days. Ofcourse they aren't trying to rush it, they don't care about the rewards, they're trying to have a fun time (and make things enjoyable for their viewers (and test the mechanics of AV)).
---
Take out the incentive to complete the bg asap, and people will gravitate towards doing what's fun, which as it turns out is actually engaging with the mechanics of AV, who would've thunk it? 
---
Now if only we could get all those older, additional mechanics back for there to be even more fun... bah, who am I kidding, everyone rush to exalted and then never touch the bg again! xD
---
It's speed 1.6, it's actually terrible, saying that it's 20-30% more dps than your current 2 hander means you're ignoring a lot of factors such as AP, hamstring kiting and overpower.
---
Would he have killed Wolf if Wolf were a cat?? Hmm...
---
I agree 100% with him, but don't start complaining if some people won't invite you to their raid / group.
---
We know the game, it's been out for 15 years. You know exactly how strong your class / spec is from the start. 
---
If you want to meme spec do it for the memes and have fun with it.
---
I’ll have a few nights a week my wife will play. I’ll roll my alt to level with her and play my main in my solo time. 
---
I doubt my alt will be doing much end game content. My wife doesn’t even want to run dungeons now because of a failed mythic plus run on retail. The people were rude and she took it personal. Now it’s just questing for her. 
---
Those buttheads cost me my pocket healer. Now she’s back to dps.
---
retail pop is really migrating to classic. since everyone played horde on retail, they somehow do the same on classic now. everyone i know who used to play alliance in classic now wants to play horde
---
Maybe raid dps the ceilings aren't much different.  But hunter seems to have way more tools and abilities at his disposal to truley min/max.  I'm thinking mostly in PvP.  It's easy as a rogue to pick up and feel good because you can just pop all your CDs and murder someone pretty easily.  Hunter seems a lot harder to master.
---
found the healer
---
Yeah but we're not being inconsistent. Melee leeway pets and simulated spell batching are bad should be fixed so they work accurately. Gameplay changes are bad and should not be made. There's no inconsistency there.
---
There's also a fundamental difference between trying and failing to create an accurate emulation, and intentionally changing how a mechanic works for game balance reasons.
---
It wouldn't be Classic without hybrids whining that they're not good at anything except taking loot and begging Blizzard to do something about it.
---
Plus oractically requiring 8 naxx-geared prot warriors for 4 horsemen.
---
Because it is a single player game.
---
It makes perfect sense, people want something that "looks good" because they think they spend a lot of time looking at their character, when in actuality the only time they do is when they're logging in.
---
Paladin.
---
so basically dual spec but having to pay gold every time
---
I see, thanks you. Trying to nab Broken Tooth is gonna be a brutal challenge for Hunters.
---
If you Uber twink you enchant your heirlooms and still mail them.
---
Tailoring will get your quick cheap bags and later a great gear set, enchanting will get you good wands. They're really not bad leveling choices at all.
---
You can be flexible with getting world buffs. You can get them at any time and then just stay logged out until the raid starts.
---
Example A: I have a lot of time to play on raid night so ill just get the buffs before the raid starts
---
Example B: I wont be able to play during the day of raid night so ill get the buffs before i log out the day before and log in fully buffed when raid starts.
---
It's just annoying how people propose something like this and have no solution and they completely deflect when asked.
---
Demi Lovato plays wow???
---
I hate DKs, so it's probably a coincidence
---
Gosu just means "high hand" in Korean and is used by l33t epic starcraft gamer pros
---
I have looked occasionally on this since the release date was announced, I don't normally visit this site. 
---
Also, I am in no way going to pretend I am going to "solve" anything, especially not class balance in a 100% hypothetical scenario with literally no data to give any guidelines in either 1 vs 1 or group PvP or PvE in any group or raid composition. "Tuning the numbers" is the only answer you are going to get as I do not have access to the data required to give you an actual answer, which I think you are well aware of. 
---
As for the gear you are of course correct however I recall in some expansion that AP was translated into SP. Now if one were to use a retribution paladin as an example you could, as part of a talent overhaul, give the option to spec into AP also giving you SP and being able to throw an instant cast FoL. Maybe if you have 3 charges of whatever the buff is called that increases your damage on crit you can consume them to cast an instant cast FoL for free but you would still want mana for and mana potions for your DPS rotations. 
---
Again, it will need to be in line with other classes but WotLK was able to create something similar so it is in no way impossible to make it work, it was just that it never ended up that way as the devs simply didn't have enough time.  I would highly recommend checking out the links to Esfand's conversations. 
---
Being able to further customize your character in the way that you prefer without sacrificing viability might never be achieved to 100% but that is not to say it shouldn't be possible to get something at least decently viable for raids.
---
Is it really a tall order to understand that people who used to play this game are now adults with responsibilities? Crazy right?
---
You cant actually use ms in raids though, your guild wont allow you to do it as there are debuffs that are way more beneficial for the raid, actually every other debuff is better
---
I used to sit at the camp in 1K and just watch priests mind control poor sods off the bridge.
---
Doesn't matter how hard the content is, you can't expect everyone else in your raid to spend time and effort into min maxing and then roll up as an oomkin with no pots and expect to get carried.
---
You know from the start if you roll a healing class and want to be in a top guild you will heal. If you want to go for a meme spec you will have to find a casual guild. Nothing wrong with that.
---
It’s one of those things, if you don’t want to use it you don’t have to. But yes, I’m not asking for a free respec, just the qol feature.
---
Do you really come here and post pirate server stuff?
---
I farmed them and crimson whelps to fund my mount, about 90-120ish gold a pop on my server.
---
For the record, I don't recommend doing that to make money, it was terribly random and time consuming compared to more consistent farms.
---
No more shamans than paladins I’d wager.
---
Marriage is just a leash nowadays and a terrible idea.
---
I'm thinking of the responses this thread got, and other responses suggesting Enchanting is best leveled at 60: https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c0ynox/questions_on_leveling_as_an_enchanter/
---
Did you watch the video? His opinion is that world buffs should be removed once you enter the raid, not to remove them from the game. This is essentially an exploit, blizzard never intended for players to go on a world buff crusade before raids. 
---
He even lists many more negatives and reasons to remove them once you enter the raid. 
---
&gt; With or without world buffs, good players will still be first, and bad players will still be last. 
---
What you fail to realize is that world buffs trivialize already VERY EASY content, it will lower the bar even more.
---
Just open up your RES settings console and edit the Keyword filter to hide all posts and comments containing the words Druid, Shaman, and Paladin.
---
For me its the fact that the camera pivot point is so damn low when playing gnome. Just something I could never get used to.
---
Indeed, they also never have a decent answer for "how would this improve the game?"
---
Okay Honey! Your argument only lasts on Autoshot. 
---
But a Hunter back then used Arcane Shot, Concussive Shot, Multishot, a variety of Stings, Distracting Shot, Scatter Shot.
---
By removing Autoshot out of this "rotation", doesn't mean, that he is unable to fight. In fact, to use these abilities WHILE moving was THE metagame for a Hunter in PVP and while leveling. It is the definition of kiting as a Hunter. Even the late game Hunterquests were build around these techniques.
---
So stop posting bullshit and sayin' "a Hunter can't fight while moving"
---
&gt; I read that a year ago and, while John is a great guy, I find this section of his book very distasteful. It's sort of an appeal to authority; "let us think for you, for you are unqualified."
---
If this is how you feel after reading that excerpt, you didn’t understand what he’s saying and are exactly the kind of person he’s talking about
---
Nobody said anything about realism, but this is an mmoRPG. The game should be designed so it adheres to the rules of the fantasy world to create immersion. Of course some sacrifices have to be made when it comes to game mechanics, especially for a 15 year old game. 
---
There's a reason why undead can't be shamans, and that only tauren and night elves can be druids. The class fantasy was very important to the designers, this according to Kevin Jordan, who was one of the original class designers for WoW
---
They create some interesting social dynamics, from what I've seen and read. I see people talking about coordinating their buffs with their guild. The planning that goes into it. The PvP that springs up to gank buffed guilds. The efforts to speed run raids and how world buffs are some extra juice to squeeze. 
---
Also, they are another thing that gets 60s out into the world. 
---
All that said, I do think they're kind of a wart. If the raids were more difficult and world buffs were the things that supplemented progression I'd feel more fondly but they instead contribute to the natural circumstance of most of the raid content being totally trivial. While it's cool to see guilds clearing BWL in nearly 15 minutes on private servers, it's also very sad.
---
Haha true😀 i meant the easier😀 i am sure i dont have a high skillcao but who knows
---
Groups shouldn't be marking casters for Hunters to CC unless there is a clear spot of LoS for the hunter to pull the caster to.
---
In the beta pve server it's all spread out evenly between classes horde side with a few exceptions
---
My guild has 1000 members and from all our lvl 31 - 40 (cap) - i would say the most popular are hunters and warriors.  The least common, by far, are druids.
---
Now this is a beta and folks might just be trying things out.
---
I don't mind client-side changes such as improved graphics as long as people can play with the original original graphics if they wish to. I got mixed feelings about the battlenet feature as I can see how that could be abused but then again with all these different ways of communicating with each other nowadays it's hard to prevent anyway so ye..   
---
There are a few other changes such as loot trading and items being in their 1.12.1 state right from phase 1. I mean it's Blizzards own decision so thats just the way it is.
---
I thought shaman was one of the least favourite classes.
---
Just learning warriors.  I know there's a ton of rules for stuff like main hand vs offhand.  Fury vs Arms for leveling etc.  I replaced a 12 dps 2h, and threw my old 1h in the offhand.  Stuff seems to be dying a lot easier.  Right now I am dual wield Fury, with a sit macro.  I'm lazy and not doing the hamstring outrange thing.  
---
Anyway you know to search for OP 2h quest rewards?
---
I know about hamstring kiting, I just don't know how the weapon swing mod is helpful.
---
Are there other techniques it'll be useful for?
---
I was going to say no one really cares but damn, based on your other videos it’s clear this is all you got going for yourself. So you know what, you do you man, fight the good fight.
---
Wife,  dog,  school,  work,  all those can be left behind,  let your mom know to make room in the attic.
---
#English is a language, where any comma is optional.
---
I'm doing the opposite and playing the same old class and race that I mained since TBC.
---
Hunter and warlock. I don't like pets.
---
I agree that exploit seems over-the-top and is probably a clickbait word for their YouTube channel. I think the reasoning behind using it is that they don’t think that the private server world buff meta fits the devs’ design intentions (“an exploit is the use of a bug or glitches, game system, rates, hit boxes, speed or level design etc. by a player to their advantage in a manner not intended by the game's designers.”).
---
I don’t have a horse in this race, as I’ll be running a chill guild with nothing to prove and an express desire to avoid forcing our players to min-max, but I find the topic interesting and telling whenever Blizzard decides to chime in on it.
---
Thanks for taking the time to reply!
---
Most people with families and who arent into games take their vacation from May to August. 
---
taking your yearly vacation anywhere from September to December will be much easier.
---
So just work now, enjoy summer, take your vacation when nobody wants it and accumulate extra credit with your company for taking one for the team by taking your vacation in winter.
---
oh don't get me wrong, i like the idea. it's just this sub is sometimes really bipolar. at one point everyone goes "qol ruins the game" and then you have "gimme gimme qol"
---
Is set twisting possible in the beta?
---
I know it was possible all throughout vanilla but it wasn't discovered til TBH. I'm curious if they left it in. If they did that'll make playing a paladin a little more active.
---
Come to the dark side!
---
They specifically have been making a fuss about those things though.
---
Exactly. Every class has its pros and cons. For example, warriors are the best tanks and are great dps, but they are the worst class for solo world pvp and duels.
---
That’s a little much. You just need to clearly communicate from the beginning what each mark means and let people do their job. But also pay attention to their mana/health and if you noticed things are low just communicate. Dungeons weren’t THAT hard where you needed a paragraph before each pull.
---
&gt; Nobody said anything about realism,
---
&gt; but it would not be feasible to create a class that relies on stealth in a realistic way
---
Hmm...
---
When Vanilla launched and up to patch 1.9 every AH was separate. The "main" auction houses were IF for Alliance and Org for Horde. The 3 neutral auction houses were also separate from each other. 
---
Yes, each character will have it's own bank.

Go for a hike, look at your local hiking/cycling/running/frisebee/parkfootball/batminton groups and enjoy your outside time.
---
And take your yearly vacation in autumn when nobody else wants to take it.
---
there are nothing but advantages from a late release from a gamers perspective.
---
To play either shaman or Druid very well definitely takes a good amount of skill. Out of the two I’d say shaman has a lower skill floor.
---
I’d go elemental shaman 30/0/21. Very fun spec, high burst damage and you should be able to heal dungeons just fine.
---
The highest tier one is repeatable, but gives less rep than the first time you do it. I think it's like 75, but 200 the first time you do it.
---
well we play on 1.12 where frostshock is shit
---
Once again you proved that you don't know at all what we talk about. Aestethics and person caring how something looks doesn't have any correlation to time used looking at the subject a person likes to look nice. Do you think people who want to wear nice clothes or makeup needs to look in the mirror 24/7 to show that is important to him? If a person buys nice furnitures because he wants his home to look nice should him stay home 24/7 look for them? Your argument that there is some kind of time related requirement to fill is absolutely borderline retarded.
---
I know the feeling, which is why I endorse these kind of adding. I love the idea of vanilla wow but then I love the ability to make it the game I want.
---
Seriously.  More importantly, casters need to get out of that shit habit of immediately plopping down and drinking after combat.  Get your ass up there with the rest of the group and plop down while the tank is marking and setting up the pull.  Now, you can drink during the first 7-10 seconds of the fight and start casting right away.
---
to be fair MDI was played in Sydney, Australia so for most of NA it started at 2am. MDI usually floats around 25k-30k viewers
---
Disc is actually pretty amazing in PvP and you can 1v1 shadow priests w/ PI and shadow burn, just have to deal with the one silence. Can heal PvE with it too and try farming lashers if that's a thing. Otherwise, group up and do orb runs. You can make it work and avoid the respec costs while still being viable doing anything.
---
The polls are taken with rose-colored glasses on. 
---
You don't have to look farther than a... uh, certain server census... to see what people will roll. 
---
For Horde, Shaman is the second least played, only beaten by druid. 
---
Mages are literally 20% of the population on each side. 1 out of every 5 players is a mage.
---
I'll consider a feature like this, but that feels like the responsibility of a different addon since this one is targeted to leveling where you'll probably not be respeccing.  
---
If I were to do this feature, I would just have a "one-click" solution where you import and it fills out the talents automatically, without having to click on each one.
---
&gt;Preserving the classic wow experience would mean removing world buffs in raids.
---
Preserving the vanilla wow experience would be to leave the world buffs in and letting people choose if they want to use them. Just like your less tryhard guild chose not to.
---
Ok so a couple of things:
---
1. You think spriests and ele shamans are overpowered but you seemingly don't want them to be brought in line? 
---
2. If you are ok with this, why would you argue against hybrid specs being more valid and thus making them more in line with the spriests and ele shamans?
---
You can't both have your cookie and eat it, mate. Also do you honestly want me, a lone stranger on the internet, to solve class balance for Blizzard do you? That would be best left up to them as they have the resources and I do not.
---
Retribution paladins were already taken towards where they needed to go in WotLK, there is nothing that says it cannot be done. Did you miss the part about a complete talent overhaul to enable each class to specc into a viable build that isn't necessarily cookie cutter?
---
The devs themselves said they **knew** people wanted to play paladins as sturdy front liners with the ability to throw an occasional heal yet the entire Vanilla WoW raiding was standing in the back spamming FoL.
---
Class balance is one of the areas where Classic can be better!
---
Priest4Life
---
Is gurubashi going to be active from launch? I know most PvP stuff is phase 2 but it's already active in the beta so I'm not sure.
---
Does Metroid hold his gun in his right or left hand?
---
Is Tailoring worth it as a time investment just for Truefaith Vestments as a Priest? Considering if I should level it up and farm the pattern and then switch to Engineering. Or I could just go for Robes of the Exalted...
---
I'm right there with ya. I can't even pick a faction. I played Horde in Vanilla(still do) and I was kinda thinking I would play Alliance to switch things up, but it just doesn't feel like home so I'm leaning Horde again. Then I start thinking and wondering if that's the right decision to keep me interested. I think I want to heal, so that helps narrow it down, but there are things I like and dislike about every healing class so it's tough picking one.
---
any class that use cloth.
---
Awkward https://trashguild.se/
---
Those are some great points. I’m genuinely curious how a modern mythic player would fare without all of the anachronistic advantages we will have in Classic (ie shield slam and 1.12 talents in MC, world buff meta, etc.).
---
Basically any kind of caster. I hate the idea of standing there watching a spell bar fill up and god forbid something has a fast attack speed.
---
Yes of course, because if some "content maker" does not like the feature it should be removed.
---
To answer your opening question, I think some people are worried that the min-max mentality of this sub will carry on once the servers go live. And if you really want to play a certain spec, it's obviously frustrating to read "lol go holy or go home" all the time.
---
That being said, I don't get why people react this strongly to other people's opinion on reddit. I play a hunter and have never ever had a problem with people telling me my DPS was low. Because I'm good at it. If you are a very good, dedicated ret pally, welcome aboard! If you are lazy, toxic undead rogue, you can go loktar yourself.
---
FOR THE HORSE!
---
But that doesnt answer thr question as to why they wouldnt just play a vanilla private server while they wait
---
idk what you mean by same concept but if you have VW out you can sacrifice it and basically just outlive the mage by dotting and fearing and curse of tongues if you feel like it. same thing with felhunter but you just purge the frost shield  and dot/fear/deathcoil/hs. havent played a lock at high level in a very long time I've only recently played a warr on a server but a mage vs a lock is a hard match up for the mage. also at 60 locks gear up way faster than mages (b/c theres so many mages in a raid and so few locks) so this gives an advantage to locks as well. (plus lock tier gear is better for pvp than it is for pve)
---
 No - Warrior, Rogue, Paladin, &amp; Hunter. Probably not - Druid &amp; Warlock. Meh - Mage.
---
Except those aren't going to be the ones playing Vanilla wow.
---
The only people who went through the trouble of downloading a whole new client and modifying the connection data in order to play on private servers were the tryhards who got into Vanilla too late to be successful.
---
Classic is primarily going to be filled with casuals who feel nostalgic.  
---
You can tell by watching anybody stream the AV tests.  
---
It's the nerfed version of AV where games only lasted 15-20 minutes because people had the base race strategies figured out.
---
However games are lasting hours because the majority of people just run it down to die in the field of strife or on one of the base bridges.
---
It's annoying listening to all these private server assholes thinking they have it all figured out because they played on a server with 90% hardcore players.
---
You know, cows, horses, whatever!
---
Unless you have a source, the WoW diary entry in the OP makes me think you're probably super wrong
---
Rogues can't give out buffs. I plan on rolling a rogue but I'll feel a bit like a shit if I'm running on the road and I get buffed by someone and I can't buff them back.
---
Don't like em don't use em. It's as simple as that.
---
Druids.
---
I am not a flag carry player and druids suck dick at virtually everything in the game that is not flag carrying.
---
Those people don't want to accept that classic is a different game than retail. If they want to do PvE and PvP they will have to accept that they either aren't optimal for one of those or have to respec regularly
---
How many times are you going to repost your annoying videos?
---
&gt;by a player to their advantage in a manner not intended by the game's designers.
---
Even using your definition, this absolutely wouldn't apply to buffs. The purpose of a buff is to be intended to use that buff. If it wasn't the intention the buff would either not exist, or be acquired by non-standard means like duping, or walljumping.  
---
As for not having a horse in the race, even chill guilds almost universally expect raiders to keep a head for next week, or the rend hand in for before a raid etc etc. Granted chill guilds don't go as far as tuber farming, DM:N stuff etc, but they will almost certainly be doing the large world buff sensibly.
---
I don't want to burst your bubble, but hand of sulfuras will be very hard for you too get. That is usually rewarded to the guildie people think deserve it the most because of their contributions to the raid. So it's not often given to enchancement shamans or ret pallies because they don't contribute much to the raid, even with nightfall - nightfall is better off on in the hands of an offtank normally.
---
If you get all the mats for nightfall yourself and craft it yourself a guild will probably let you use it because of your dedication, but you're still going to end up healing alot :0
---
I really recommend at 60 you stick with weapon smithing/engineering. The engineering will be required for your spec to be useful in the raid, and the weapon smithing is required for you to craft nightfall yourself. Like i said before it's really important to get the mats yourself and craft it so you can prove your dedication to your guild, because you're definitely less useful than a resto shaman, a rogue, or a warrior. 
---
If you really want to drop weapon smithing after you craft nightfall than enchanting or alchemy is your best bet, again to provide something useful to your guildmates. You need be in the mindset of "how can I make myself useful to my teammates in ways other than dps" because your dps will be subpar. 
---
I hope this was helpful.
---
I am glad at least some people read and **understood** my post... :)
---
I think the most important thing first of all is to understand what the player base is interested and why people want to play WoW Classic and then take it from there. Assuming it's financially beneficial for Blizzard to keep some WoW Classic servers as is, progress some to TBC, some to WotLK and some where they create new content for Classic then all that is stopping them is getting the information. 
---
Of course there is the risk that they mess it up badly but if they understand the motivations of the player base they have a better chance of creating new content that would appease the players.
---
There's plenty of posts about hybrids, because they're interesting to people I guess. But I don't see any posts demanding tuning, is this really such a meta issue?
---
You have to endure the mcdonalds sponsorship that is tier 1 paladin set but the payoff with judgement makes it all worth it lol
---
Bro remove dog from this list. Everything else for sure
---
Blizzard has no reason to care if pservers got things right or wrong and they certainly don't need to lie about  classic values etc. It's such a random thing to doubt.
---
Yeah, that’s where I fall personally, too. I’m more curious just to hear the arguments on both sides and really curious to hear what Blizzard ultimately decides.
---
Ive just happened to have the same junk email and set of passwords over the last 15 years so i guessed it lol
---
Mage, Getting 2 shot on the regular is no fun.
---
That's what I'm doing.  Glad I did because I'm pretty sure I'm switching from rogue to hunter.
---
And then you pvp and have 60kb
---
What ive heard is that they dont affect it at all. The only way a weapon can affect druids form-damage is through attack speed increase (and maybe attack power but thats not as important).
---
Thats why the real hc feral druids of endgame will be farming gnomeregan for Manual Crowd Pummeler because of its attack speed buff.
---
There doesnt seem to be any guides about it and im pretty sure weapon has always been nothing but a statstick for druids. Atleast in the early years.
---
But you can already play vanilla wow on a private server....
---
The best possible product is not always the most popular. Look at iPhones and Macs.
---
Blizzard owns all rights to all content made with in-game footage or screenshots of their game. They should just demand any and all revenue from Twitch and YouTube.
---
In a game with 8 classes.
---
Agreed. Odds are, you are resto for raids.
---
Will of the forsaken is super broken and their animations are awesome
---
Should be day one active
---
Twitch bought curse. They have an addon manager. That is the program you will want to be using.
---
To this day I'm still not quite sure what the Recklessness icon is supposed to be. I've always seen it as a crab claw.
---
Nope it’s a DM thing according to other folks around here. Best you can get from a vendor is 45 water and food.
---
Using keybinds "technically existed in vanilla" even though not everyone used them like they do it today. 
---
Should we remove that from the game too because it makes players much stronger?
---
Should we make people have higher latency, lower FPS and smaller monitors too because that's technically how everyone played?
---
The guilds on my server did use the Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer on progression raiding so would we take out all world buffs except that one?
---
There are millions of different things people will do in classic because we know a lot more about the game and are better players on average.
---
Why are you saying sorry? He didn't say anything rude to or about you. It is pretty easy to infer that his "people are still clueless"-comment was not directed at you but rather to people spreading the misinformation you have been hearing.
---
Which is why I would love to see official Blizzard polls asking questions like what people like/don't like and why about the various iterations of WoW
---
More than 8. And it’s from the best to worst. But yea, whatever you say bro
---
I disagree.  If you're a squared away enough tank to mark pulls appropriately and call out mechanics then you should be more than capable of glancing at the healer's mana bar occasionally and realizing if the healer needs more time to drink or not.
---
Might as well ask the Mage if he's ready to Sheep?  
---
Hunter ready to trap?   
---
Rogue ready to sap?  
---
Okay, wait, pat just came back...
---
This is a group dungeon, the implication is that everyone should be ready.  A cursory glance at mana bars between each pull is all that is needed for a good tank.
---
Not even steps. Oh the ground is now a different color? Enjoy your 1 foot blink.
---
Open world ganking? Rogue is definitely the best, you just can't beat the combination of high escapability, undetectable approach, high burst, and high control.
---
That being said I'd say (night elf) hunter is a close second, you have the longest engagement range of any class, high in combat movespeed, basically inescapable for anyone but druids once engaged, high burst damage, strong crowdcontrol (a little varied depending on spec, but traps are sick) and as a night-elf you can even lay a stealth ambush with a cat (or a pet that blends into the surrounding monsters or is just told to stay out of line of sight). The only downside is you don't have the escapability of things like sprint+vanish, so you have to pick your fights more carefully.
---
Classic Battlegrounds are just not nearly as fun as most players remember.
---
There are plenty of contexts where you're the douche if you lifetap and dont health funnel yourself back up though.
---
Thats when arena pvp started. Humans had stealth detection racial and warlocks got extra detection on top of that. Finding enemy rogue was massive advantage, auto win in many match ups.
---
Love the Family Guy reference :)
---
They are expensive. MBP cost for average person is too much. 
---
Whatever, you think that dead product was somehow figured out, no one can help you.

IT might reflect a 2k frostbolt and a 1.5k cone of cold. Very much worth iT imo
---
It was a thing in vanilla, lol. It was an intended mechanic. Just because you didn't use it to its fullest doesn't mean it wasn't a thing? I doubt you were flasked 24/7 in raid either, but you're not calling for the removal of flasks.
---
First off I never said overpowered so stop putting words in my mouth to win your reddit argument. You didn't answer my question. How do they balance those specs to perform well in PVE while keeping them in line in PVP. Additionally its not just a fucking tuning issue its gear optimization. Shamans, druids, pallys don't have tier options like the big dick DPS specs do whats your solution to that add more gear options like fuck no.
---
It's also pretty easy to infer that he was directing it at people like mean when he said that the information has been stated countless of times on other forums. Personally, it seemed to me that he was being a little snarky about me not knowing "basic information" but I can see how it could be taken the other way as well.

Been saying it from day 1 - anyone that goes into classic trying to re-live 15 year old nostalgia will quit within 2 months.
---
does it work on cone of cold? thought it only worked on singletarget
---
What do they do?
---
5% of a level every 8 hours. Cap of 10 days, or 1.5 levels.
---
Maybe because that's what they want to play?
---
Not everyone enjoys meme specs.
---
Your wrong, admit it and get out of my thread
---
&gt;  I replaced a 12 dps 2h, and threw my old 1h in the offhand. Stuff seems to be dying a lot easier. 
---
What you've really done is replace a 5% chance to miss with white attacks, with a 24% chance to miss white attacks (on targets that are equal level to you, assuming full weapon skill). It may seem like you're doing more damage, but you almost certainly are not. Especially when white attacks are what gets you rage.
---
Not even 24 hours, seems rushed to me.
---
C C C C COMBO BREAKER!!!
---
Can't go wrong with tanking then imo, warrior tanks will always be highly sort out. Druid tanks can do tanking aswell but if you wanna be in demand for raids warrior is the way to go for sure.
---
&gt; is it still #nochanges to cut world buffs out of the Classic raiding experience?
---
\#nochanges means, unsurprisingly, not any changes.
---
That's the whole point, that people want the game warts and all.
---
No it's not, but you must be an extremely busy person if you can't even set a couple of hours aside once a week. What kind of life is that? To be in so little control of your time.. 
---
My brother works full time and has 3 kids. He raids twice a week with me. It can't be that impossible to at least raid once a week.
---
I'm not sold on a lot of those responses. Many of them have gripes with gathering professions at large and enchanting is not a conventional gathering profession. Someone even suggested leveling mining/engineering as a moneymaker which is a bit laughable.
---
I guess warlocks don't need wands as much as priests or mages. You could level with skinning instead to make some vendor cash but that would forfeit disenchanting your quest rewards. The main reason people run skinning is to afford the mount at 40.
---
They can play what ever spec they want. Guilds are allowed to select whatever players they want. I wish them luck getting into a raiding guild with a hybrid spec.
---
It's easy - ignore them, they won't gain traction and blizzard (hopefully) won't ruin classic :)
---
Complete nonsense. AV had by far the most participation out of all the BGs on my server throughout all of vanilla, until they removed Korrak and quests and made it boring.
---
It was by far WAY more popular than WSG or AB.
---
If nothing else I think they'd be interesting to read. Imagine the different kinds of answers you'd get?

I thought it was a curved sword being swung down? Andin the back maybe it's ripping through something... Recklessly? Lol
---
It's much more than that.  I've been in groups that can clear LBRS in 40 minutes while other groups have taken two hours.
---
Some short instances like SM Cath you want to farm for the gear.  If you can clear it fast enough it is actually decent xp.  The faster you clear it, the more chances you get for the gear to drop as well.
---
Plenty of reasons to pull your boot straps up and perform well.
---
No because the rewards are vastly superiour to anything outside of much later content.
---
Like the other guy said, it's about flexibility.
---
Mages eat warriors for breakfast.
---
Yes attack speed very important on pet, only few have 1.0 attack speed.
---
Yeah, I’m sure many guilds will, but again, the 8h cooldowns on head turn-ins is probably enough of an ass-pain to dissuade most casual guilds. Most private servers do not have the same cooldown duration which accounts for some of the difference in meta. 
---
As for my guild, I doubt we will be keeping many heads, as we will be raiding just once a week during prime time and the buff is virtually guaranteed to be on cooldown by a more hardcore guild looking to get an edge on their rivals.
---
this was just a categorical refusal to life tap. Generally, what I did was life drain life/health funnel back up to full if I could but this guy only used rank 1 heals on me because he caught me life tapping and refused to resurrect anyone in the group.
---
Yes and people do that, but you can only experience these level caps on the beta this will never happen again.
---
I want to play the beta to test things, you can't do that on pservers.
---
😂🤭 idk why this made me laugh so hard but it did
---
hard choice, female can fit through more random small places because of the smaller model and you can make them look absolutely terrifying, which is cool paired with a name like Maneater. Male undead is classic as fuck but I think the most played race/class combo in Vanilla will be Male undead frost mage. Thanks to streamers such as Venruki showing off his PvP skills alongside Xaryu and Ziqo, mages are in the spotlight right now. Having mained an undead mage since 2005 I’m pretty upset there will be a bunch of clones, as I like playing classes with not much popularity. :/
---
May end up maining a Druid just for this reason I’m classic, could help me experience the game in a whole new way, and I can just see myself getting worked up seeing all the undead mages running around come September. Not mentioning the competition for gear lol 
---
Tauren Druid 😤😤😤
---
No, retail has a ton of features to make the game attractive to casual players which are the vast majority of players. The people who want a more hardcore and time consuming game will go to classic but that is not even 20% of WoW players. Maybe some will come from other games but there are a lot more games that can compete for that type of audience.
---
But if he doesn't miss, he does more damage right?
---
Warrior, boring as hell, need more rage..
---
If you believe in the infinite universe theory then, somewhere out there, people are looking forward to the release of a Classic that has turned up the difficulty to compensate for all of the built-in catchup mechanisms in 1.12.
---
Right. I think the only real issue is that what will be most financially beneficial to the company is monetization of the game beyond the 15/mo sub fee. I feel like they can't see past their own noses when it comes to this...but maybe the latest survey that went out to some people will help a bit? At least it's an attempt...
---
There's always some dumbass in a raid advocating for it too.
---
Its not me suggesting that because Im another person ffs.
---
&gt;&gt; Because its not me suggesting that and I'm focusing on the arrogant part.
---
&gt; because literally 0% of your enjoyment of the game comes from spec, class or race selection.
---
That standpoint is hilarious. Sorry, I dont even want to talk to you anymore.
---
What the fuck.
---
I have updated the addon and it _should_ fix this issue.  Let me know what other problems you run into.
---
I think you're overstating how careful you have to be. We usually just started runs by saying "Moon is sheep, nipple is sap" and then I would sheep after the sap to pull. We didn't have to have a mantra before every pull.
---
There are 3 and 2 of them come from ZG, so they won't be available for almost a year.
---
Yes, but he \*\*does\*\* miss on average 19% more often. Which is gigantic.
---
#mykindahealer
---
No innervate for you!
---
Random fact: Shamans used to get ressurrection sickeness when using reincarnation. They changed it a few months after release.
---
Shaman easier - don't have to change forms, just lay down totems.
---
Stfu say Druid u lil btch stop overcrowding the boat
---
Cool story.  I don't want to treat the game like a job where I have 39 other people relying on me to make raid hours.  Thanks for your concern tho 🙄
---
What you usually want to do is judge seal of the crusader as soon as you pull an enemy - in the vast majority of fights this is a significant date bonus vs just judging righteousness when you start.
---
After you judge crusader it's best to have righteousness up and judge it every ten seconds.
---
Once you hit level twenty you swap out righteousness for command. But judging it is pretty much a waste because of the low damage.
---
There are situations where seal of the crusader is flat out superior to righteousness but they're less common. It gives you a 40% swing speed increase, but it leaves your dps untouched except for the attack speed bonus. That means very slow weapons benefit from it more than fast weapons - the AP bonus is usually very large for the level.
---
I recommend reading a guide, I'll see if I can dig one up
---
I like how you say my argument is borderline retarded, right after you compare aestethics ingame to real life.
---
In real life there's status and prestige associated with looking nice, having nice furniture and art, in game it's the exact opposite.
---
It is longer, it's bugged
---
I don't see what's so exciting about playing a character that is going to be deleted in 2 months.
---
Duly noted!
---
Yeah that mass of mental masturbation is definitely legitimate.
---
"You're wrong. You're very wong because you're wrong. I have no examples or explanations, but you're really wrong!"
---
Thanks guy
---
I don't know about you guys, but my mage group in my guild was pretty damn close. WE were always stoked when someone got a piece, and we had our own channel [vendingmachines] were we dicked around during raids.  It was fantastic camaraderie.  We made fun of warlocks, and begged priests to give us infusion for sexual favors. Good times.
---
Blizzard stating something doesn't make it true. It's common knowledge they often think they know best but then fuck everything up because the people actually wanted something else.
---
Most regular BG players loved old AV, it was the most popular battleground by far. It never got boring to a massive amount of people, except until they changed it. This 1.12 version of AV? This is what people got bored of, QUICK. Like few months and AV was deserted.
---
&gt;The majority of polls are nostalgia based. Give people the opportunity to play those matches, their tune will change.
---
False. It was just better game desing to have Korrak and a lot of other content more than 1.12 AV which just has LESS CONTENT.
---
&gt;I was watching Swifty (and so happened to be in his AV as well) and he was even saying “damn, this game has gone on for more than 2 hours. Are we gonna win this?” And that’s the feeling. It looks and sounds fun until you start doing it, then it’s a completely different story.
---
Nothing about that statement implies he didn't find it fun. And again, this is 1.12 AV. He would be finding it more fun if it was pre 1.12 AV which had way more things to do.
---
AV not only looks and sounds fun, but doing it feels fun as hell, as long as it's pre 1.12 AV.
---
You are delusional.
---
By the time AV hits BWL will be available.
---
The rewards you get from AV are rep rewards, longer AV means more reputation.
---
Haters Honda hate, I am going too roll a ret paladin
---
Yes, great news!
---
But if he kills 50 mobs in 30 minutes and misses 14 times, isn't that faster than killing 50 mobs in 40 minutes with missing 4 times?
---
I don't see why his dps dictates his leveling speed.
---
I'm in California but I work nights. I'm hoping there will be an Aussie server I can join.
---
&gt;Only the absolute try-hardest of guilds (like the world first KT kill) used world buffs.
---
At some points, there were half a dozen guilds on my little server using world buffs.  It wasn't just the first guild to kill KT, every guild to kill KT would have used them.  Many guilds that did not kill KT would have used them.
---
What you call Try-hard was pretty much a requirement if you wanted to clear more than a few bosses in Naxx.
---
You get to feel the game, its a lot different than 1.12, you get to set your addons, learning which quests have higher drop rates and stuff. People playing the beta are getting a pretty big advantage over the people who are forced to watch only (or play on PSers) Also with the AV test, its a good way to decide what to play on release. I really wish i had an invite so i can better decide between rogue or lock.
---
Warrior gameplay seems absolutely dreadful boring to me.
---
From waiting 10 years for your autoattack to hit, to waiting to get enough rage to spend on various melee attacks that dont have much thrill about them either.
---
Paladin comes close second but thats only in vanilla tbh, the class was much more interesting in later expansions.
---
Rogue. It's just too dirty.
---
Those evasion tanking rogues tho
---
#Ibelieve. Thanks for the /soothe :)
---
It also says druids can use spears
---
Has there been confirmation that vanish immune is still in the game? I absolutely loved vanish immune in PvP. It was a saver in PvE too. I know they're aiming for as few changes as possible, but I'm worried they'll try to remove this secretly.
---
99.99% of the player base in classic won't stack world buffs either.
---
Private servers attracted the semi-hardcore players who came to the game too late to be successful in Vanilla. They are chasing after the glory that they will never achieve.
---
The majority of people in the re-release are going to be casual players who are terrible at the game.  
---
There will only be a handful of servers and nobody is going to give a fuck about "firsts" since the content has been cleared 100's of times.  The majority of people will have the "I'll get there eventually" mindset.
---
Just watch any streamer, the majority of people in the beta are terrible.  
---
Look at either of the guild recruitment forums, 75% of them are semi-casual.  The only "hardcore" ones are from people whose only accomplishments were on private servers.  
---
I can tell you right now, there is no way that Classic is going to support the 30 or so "hardcore" guilds that are trying to start up.  There just won't be the talent.  The majority of guilds will have 10-15 good players that carry everyone, 10 players who are dead weight but have good attendance and 30+ players who are decent with terrible attendance so you're rotating them in and out.
---
The issue comes when most people turn you down even if you're dedicated and good enough along the general blame and hate you take from randoms which is usually worse.
---
Nihilum used them and so did most other top guilds. World buffs were used extensively.
---
There's no class I refuse to play, but I always end up maining a mage anyway. Probably warlock is my least liked class though. I'm not a fan of the pet management and I miss the mobility of mages all the more when playing a practically immobile clothie. Still, I have played and enjoyed high level warlocks as well.
---
Probably the only thing I really refuse to play is Tauren. I just feel slow when playing a Tauren, regardless of class.
---
&gt;  I’m fully with you against balancing in Classic; it’s not needed or wanted, and cuts against the point of this project.
---
How? Vanilla was being balanced through patches. Wouldn't staying true to Vanilla also mean changes at some point? Vanilla wasn't launched with 1.12 and stayed that way until TBC pre patch.
---
You just think you're not because you haven't actually ever played pre 1.12 AV. No fucking shit 3 hours of 1.12 AV is boring, it's not the same as the original, good AV that actually motivated people to play it for hours and hours.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/dressing-room
---
Yeah, I'm continually surprised by how much disparity there is in responses given how old this game is.
---
I'm leaning rather strongly towards Skinning/Tailoring right now as I think I might want to focus on getting Tailoring up early, and gold would be useful for that.
---
&gt; disenchanting your quest rewards
---
What is the benefit of this? Do the resulting mats sell better than quest rewards?
---
Is this what you’re on the lookout for?
---
https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=1172
---
Paladins do really suffer in vanilla, even in their most viable spec (Holy) the class is boring AF to play pushing the same 2 heals 99% of the time.
---
Once they got Avengers shield in TBC for example in Prot spec, the class started to be more fun to play imo.
---
Well you'll need the recipe to drop, then you'll need to win that roll. You might need to spend DKP on it depending your guild. If you plan to drop tailoring after, note you might be holding on to it for a long time, possibly multiple phases.
---
druid. on classic wanyway. druid was my main 9in wotlk but in classic it seems like such a unfinished class

---
&gt;emoving them for raids is actually preserving the vanilla experience
---
Its not, since you had the choice of using them in vanilla. Remving them from raid because you didnt use them is not preserving anything, its just forcing your less try hard experience on everyone.
---
I am sorry but aestethics is actually real life branch of philosophy. You actually managed to make counter argument that proves 100% that you don't have a clue about the concepts we talk about. Thank you for proving me right.
---
I’ll be glad to sheep a mob if tank tells me to even if I think it’s unnecessary. If tank or another dps breaks it, I’ll resheep once. After that, tough fucking shit. I’m a dps, not sheep man.
---
It’s all the Tauren farts!
---
&gt;But if he kills 50 mobs in 30 minutes and misses 14 times, isn't that faster than killing 50 mobs in 40 minutes with missing 4 times?
---
I mean sure if you pull numbers out your arse then yeah one is faster than the other.
---
I could just respond to that by saying "If he kills 50 mobs in 30 minutes and misses 5 times isn't that faster than killing 50 mobs in 40 minutes and missing 16 times" 
---
I'm not sure why you can't see how killing something faster, and more efficiently increases he amount of exp you gain in an hour.
---
Stop sperging out at me with your endless strawman bullet points, I don't care. None of what you listed requires you to literally log out as part of the mechanic. 
---
Not to mention most of what you listed people did regularly. Most people used keybinds, even though that is a shit argument for plenty of reasons. People keep saying "just cause your nontryhard guild didnt". My fucking sides dude, I was in vodka. There's even a interview with DNT where they say they didn't. There was not a more tryhard guild on the continent.
---
Nobody logged out for raid because they got a world buff. The fact that the toxic communities on Pservers are trying to bring this practice to classic is a problem.
---
We always used two voice apps. One for raids with push-to-talk and one for our class with open mic (and push-to-mute). Made raids much more enjoyable.
---
"I made a shitty comparison that shows *I* have no idea what I'm talking about and was called out on it, that proves *I*'m right"
---
wutface?
---
Now that's rough
---
Nah you obviously didn't play vanilla. People didn't complain for shit about AV, it was extremely popular.
---
&gt;Stop trying to be cool and pretend you were all super into multiday AVs
---
Stop thinking your pminority zoomer opinion is of any relevance to the general playerbase. I was extremely into multiday long AVs, and I never saw anyone have a problem with it back in the day.
---
&gt;This idea that AV was good before 1.12 is purely and utterly a myth.
---
You're a complete idiot or just the most dishonest person on this subreddit. It was objectively the best form of AV, there is a reason why it was so loved and popular and why AV got real fucking dead from 1.12 onward when they gutted it.
---
My macro was "OOM...Drinking."
---
He said he felt like he was doing more damage, because he was. - be traded % chance to miss for damage.
---
He 100% decreased his damage on a raid boss - not on leveling.
---
Fury wasn’t even good until after 1.6; people had been raiding MC for a long time at that point.
---
I honestly cant remember if totems were group or raid wide... And Lust came in BC? Right? Wonky ass memory lol
---
I agree 100%. I'm fine with people playing them and raiding with them you can clear Nax on a boomkin or ret its fine. I just don't understand teh constant need to say "for the future of the game" these classes should get tuned etc.
---
Shouldn't your pet stop attack the player/mob once you fd?
---
I wanna play a troll rogue so bad. But Undead rogue is so much better for pvp. But still... Trolls are motherfucking OG cool. Such a tough one :S grrrrrrrrr should I just multibox both at the same time? XD hahahah
---
wotf shares a cd with the pvp trinket. It's not as broken in 1.12 as it was in previous patches
---
Bags are always a money maker. Mooncloth is a great passive money maker on a CD if you can't log in too often.
---
I believe left.
---
Not too sure about the actual rate, but it caps at 2 levels of rested XP.
---
So it's really really useful post 30. Its extremely useful if you have a lot of characters - if you have 4 or more, you can basically have the entire road to 60 rested after level 20 or so. Even leveling two characters benefits quite a bit from it.
---
I plan on taking full advantage of the mechanic to level my paladin main and warlock alt at similar rates. That will let me fill any role in a dungeon my buddies need
---
Every census from "those places" that I've seen show Shamans and Paladins at 8-9% of total, so effectively 16-18% of the player base since they're faction locked ofc. Top three are usually:
---
Warrior = Mage &gt; Pal/Sham
---
gross a paladin
---
Well, it is a playet mindset issue, I presume. Minmaxing is quite more common now than then, there's been enough proof and advertising against such specs and the typical justifications for minmaxing (i.e such specs *stealing their gear*, *getting carried* and so on) are being used by the most casual pugs.
---
It's phase 1.
---
I can understand that you don't want to treat a hobby like a job, you're hardly alone in that regard. I doubt that anyone sees my nephew's football weekly football training as a job though. 
---
Be aware though that guilds don't require a 100% attendance. The core raiders will probably be expected to have above 75-90% attendance. But that's usually only like half the raid unless you're pushing Naxxramas. So there are always members or socials who fill spots. It's of course annoying if you actually have set aside a few hours and you don't get a spot, but that's the risk you have to take I guess.
---
They refer to alterac valley battleground
---
Very true! if there is a bunch of low HP mobs I usually am wanding them when I am not actively healing to try and proc that :). Actually, whenever I am not needing to cast a heal I would be wanding to help clear it faster / use less mana/ maybe proc the regen
---
For sure. Just out of curiosity, are there any other similarly high-impact strategies developed on private servers that saw little use in Vanilla? DM farming comes to mind, which also is a sticky issue. It's interesting that a lot of pservers opted to nerf that gold grind.
---
Yea i know things can get confusing for simple people. I suggest you don't stress your brains with this subject any longer.
---
Oh we did that as well. Led to some rather awkward funny moments when someone messed up the press to talk.
---
This is so spot on lmao
---
Yeah, totems were party wide which is why you wanted 8 (one per party). No lust in vanilla, correct.
---
This makes me wonder if wall climbing will be a thing again?
---
I've figured out the races and classes I want to play, but now I'm stuck on what 3 names I want to reserve...
---
My Tauren Druid I leveled when I was 13 will always be my favorite character. I never got into end game raids or a good guild, but dungeons, questing, and PvP were so much fun. I could tank, heal, or dps in 5-mans so I never got bored. Could wreck those tryhard frost Mages that people hated. Could stealth like a rogue. Could swim and run, then fly in TBC. The rotation was super fun. Cat form bleeds, roots, big starfire or w/e it was called, rejuv/renew, bear form charge, usually confused people. Probably super inefficient but I loved it as a kid.
---
2019 baby! If they get 2 pieces of loot because the "council" said so and you get nothing- ggwp!
---
It's not no-changes-that-conflict-with-our-feelies-of-how-the-classic-*experience*-should-be
---
It's nochanges.
---
Aww, give her my encouragement, will you? M+ runs in retail are hard as hell compared to dungeon content in Classic for a multitude of reasons. I've been healing in most expansions since Wrath and these days on retail people just rush bosses and try to overpower the trash without actually considering how taxing it is on their healer. 
---
Classic will be so much better, at least in most communities. I feel like people will be more forgiving and you can always slightly outlevel the dungeon before you do it, if it'll make you feel more comfortable going in there. Then you'll get the practice in and feel more comfortable at the cap.
---
What class was she hoping to heal on? Maybe I'll be able to come up with more encouragement for her!
---
My husband and I are doing the opposite as you guys: he likes to heal, so I'm going to tank.
---
That's because he is
---
"Finally, none of these assholes can pull threat the very first nanosecond after I pull."
---
What i set twisting
---
I love the rogue class, but like warrior, when its picked by so many ppl it starts to become not so special. Rogue class in pvp especially is just like the gnomes hate, nobody likes them even if theyre good.
---
I agree, but you really can't force other people to assume that you are a beast at a generally perceived underperforming spec. Prove yourself during lvling when you are doing dungeons, where specs like Ret really shine and I'm sure you will make some friends on the way that will accept the Light.
---
As a hunter, this is normal stuff as everyone assumes you are a huntard, if you play a nelf hunter. You have to prove to people you are not, as the hunter class is a huge liability if played by someone who's not very good. If played by someone skilled, it's an amazing class.
---
What's this?
---
&gt; And if you really want to play a certain spec, it's obviously frustrating to read "lol go holy or go home" all the time.
---
Just keeping the vanilla experience.
---
But to be honest i think people will be more forgiving nowadays when all the information is available and they know that its possible to clear raids without being 100% try hard.
---
First of all she’s a she...
---
What exactly do you mean by powerleveling?
---
Yeah I agree, honestly worst part anything after vanilla is that you max have like 2-3 of the same class and they usually don't even play the same spec. Everyone playing their own little unique spec is boring.
---
I guess it's because there were no arenas in vanilla, arenas got introduced in TBC.
---
Paladin because fuck alliance. Lok'tar Ogar
---
In a perfect world, yes. But for a variety of technical and logistical reasons, that's not the Classic WoW we will be getting, though I wish so much that that experience could be recaptured.
---
They should have always had a talent point that allows you to "carry" your totems with you.
---
Always thought the idea of having to keep dropping same totems cuz the group moved sounded tedious.
---
Your first paragraph is absolutely going to happen. We as a community are much much much better at this game than we were in 2004. We are better at theory crafting the best classes, specs, and we have better tools to measure ourselves and others. The second one is also true... Because a dependable raider is more important than the perfect min maxer.
---
Oh shut the fuck up, everyone fucking hated it you moron. 
---
Let me guess, you were 11 and joined it once, and were like "omg le epic battles. This is so cool"
---
Idiot
---
Which is the 27th in the US. You’re not getting it a day earlier.
---
Being a paladin was not how I imagined it to be when I got to lvl 60 and got told to heal and realised pallys dps sucked, couldn’t tank. Biggest let downs until the expansions came along. 
---
This time it’s mage or priest.
---
You can play resto to level if youd like. I've known people to level paladins and priests as holy. Just know going into it that you will be spending  significantly more time leveling than if you went with the enhancement tree. Its just not efficient for solo play, and even for duo leveling you're better off as enhancement. You'll want to build up a gear set with intellect, spirit, and +healing as  you level so you can swap when needed.
---
I don’t have a very good understanding of professions in Vanilla. How important are they? More specifically, what the hell is engineering good for? Seeing lots of people considering it.
---
Rogues and warriors use it to optimize for sword specialization talent to avoid wasting auto attacks. 
---
It’s most useful for the hamstring kiting method so that you do not lose any dps while also completely minimizing the damage you take. 
---
That way you waste no time outside of the mob hit box when your weapon should be ready
---
They're mainly for dropping at IF or Org flight master, then chain banishing for 3 hours. Not too useful otherwise.
---
So? I knew that when I replied. It was still extremely uncommon. Blizzard certainly didn't tune the fights to require world buffs.
---
I'm not even on this thread suggesting Blizzard make any changes. I'd prefer Blizzard keep world buffs in raids. But the way you're carrying on like vanilla required players get world buffs is just silly to me.
---
Private server culture, on the other hand, may mandate world buffs. But I don't give two shits about private server culture.
---
Because they’re edgy
---
It's handy to level the alt for sure.
---
you can use it on garr if your raid kills adds first

Can seal of command proc off of its own proc? And does it scale with weapon damage, strength and spell dmg?
---
Already been posted take my downvote
---
Elemental and enhancement are both really fun for pvp in my opinion and resto shamans are really good for chain heal and totems in raids. It's a good class to roll if you don't like leveling alts to explore other roles. Elemental feels like a true caster, enhancement is probably the only spec in the game that feels like a true hybrid, and you get easy raid spots as resto. The only drawback I can think of to rolling one is that shamans generally have a hard time farming mobs because their only aoe is essentially fire nova totem and chain lightning, which have cooldowns
---
You should probably read about how they are plan to implement and remove it before complaining about it.
---
Druids also get a set bonus that increases their travel form speed another 15%.

I dont game on my pc but Classic wow is my Love.

Which gpu will be good enough for classic on max graphic Settings?
---
Atm. i‘m using a Intel i5 6500 3.2 ghz cpu as a graphics card.
---
This sound like lazy, casual, raid-day logger talk to me. Try to make progress on some of those dps check encounters especially in naxx where you not only need flasks &amp; pots, but dragonslayer buff, ZG buff, etc.
---
Theyre the IRL equal of sucker punching ppl :P
---
But once you realize if they didnt do that they would get the ass kicked it kinda makes sense for the class.
---
The worsth thing to happen to a rogue is being brought out of stealth.
---
Well, if you could just explain your logic behind how getting called out on a laughably bad comparison proves you're right it wouldn't "stress my brain"
---
What other class lets you swap between weapons so often. I'd have several different one handers with on hit effects that I'd swap to depending on the class I'm fighting.
---
Swap to sword and board and back to 2h and vise versa depending on the skill I'm using.
---
You won't be selling the mats, you'll just be leveling your enchanting. But yes, reagents are almost always worth more than vending.
---
&gt; He said he felt like he was doing more damage, because he was. - he traded % chance to miss for damage.

He almost certainly **was not** doing more.

Saying you feel like it is like saying you "feel" like sugar makes your child hyper, even though objectively by double blind study it doesn't.

He is **objectively** missing 19% more often on average. Not only does that mean 19% more of the time he does absolutely **zero** damage, but he also generates **zero** rage when he does, which means he loses more damage yet again. 
---
In order to even begin offsetting such an objective loss the 1 hander would have to be several **magnitudes** higher in DPS than the two hander.
---
Because trying to compete with hundreds or thousands of players for tags on the first week is going to save the game. 
---
Also layering is just for some of phase 1 and as the player count goes down they’ll get rid of layering.
---
I'm going to need confirmation on this. I havent see it in the beta from what I remember
---
Your question is stupid bro, I already said in the post and you don't even read my answers anyway. It's under the assumption it will be balanced - end of "discussion".
---
Gear optimization can be adressed by adding new items, it's not difficult. You add more gear options. Tadaaa!
---
If you want to play in a cookie cutter one spec only meta forever with no more content or tweaks then you belong to option 1), which is to simply play Classic and never change a thing and that is fine but I want Blizzard to take this opportunity and treat Classic the way GGG treats PoE.
---
Perhaps you should re-read the post and if you have any **actual constructive** questions or ideas I am all for it! :)
---
Seal of command.
---
&gt;The argument for nochanges is to preserve the integrity of the classic wow experience.
---
No, you don't get to redefine what words mean. No *"experience"* will be the same in 2019 to begin with (not to mention that "experience" is a pretty subjective concept to begin with that can't be definitively captured). But we can preserve the game. Obviously new emergent gameplay will arise from that, that is the nature of any game with depth. New strategies, builds, leveling paths, ect will be found that were not widely known or used in actual vanilla. 
---
It's not your place or mine to dictate what conforms with the classic "experience". And even if it was, it's a fool's errand because emergent strategies will ***always*** emerge, and if you try to ad hoc retroactively squash every one, you'll end up with a game that truly doesn't look like classic.
---
Thats the thing man..i havent played for like 3 months. Got hyped about watching classic streams and charged my account again.

Log out. Charged the account june 1. Havent played since.
---
Just be aware that depending on what class you pick, even if you collect the full T2 set, will rarely wear all the gear together at once in Raid/PvP.
---
You will still have a mix match of BiS items.
---
When all you have left to defend a mechanic is the authenticity argument, then it's not a very good mechanic worth defending. It's a toxic mechanic and almost universally annoying to players, even to the point where private servers (which also aim for authenticity) remove them for the first month of a new raid.
---
I really, really wish people would educate themselves before opening their mouths.
---
&gt; Why is blizzard so insistent to implement layering?
---
* Layering
---
* 25000 people queues
---
* Empty servers after 3 weeks
---
Pick one.
---
It's just the "hybrids must heal" mindset.
---
OMG derp!
---
Gods*
---
Duh, OP!
---
Under the assumption it will be balanced. Have you kept up to date with pvp metas? Why would you assume they could balance it properly when the last 4-5 expansions have had awful arena/bg balance.
---
Loot Council is far more popular than DKP is nowadays, because the guilds goal is to make progression as fast as possible. Most loot councils do have rules that try not to leave you going long gaps without getting gear. But loot council was found to be way more beneficial FOR THE GUILD than DKP.
---
LOL. More like Blizzard forgot about it because nobody ever used them. Notice how after Vanilla world buffs never existed anymore?
---
Funny, in Classic the biggest issue with water is the cost. In Retail the biggest issue with water is remembering to buy more because I chug the stuff like an r/HydroHomie
---
Luckily in Classic i'll be maining a mage so I can chug the stuff AND don't need to buy more :D
---
Well the rest of us are not robots.
---
All the people advocating “for the future of the game” are people that haven’t played Vanilla. If they did, they’d know these hybrids won’t work. Instead they try to force Blizzard’s hand to satisfy their selfish wants.
---
Yeah but when you get new water you produce it like x2 at a time
---
There won't be as many rogues as in vanilla. Every single online poll points to warriors, shamans and mages as the most popular. Rogue is usually around 5th.
---
Nah, Kendo but HEMA looks fun, too.
---
A few weeks before release players can create characters to reserve names, we’ll know how many server blizz will do and what regions will have servers.
---
Avoid Loot Council. And avoid any version of DKP. [Loot lists are the best](http://onslaught-wow.com/about/). Never any drama, everyone always knows what’s happening to every piece of loot before it drops, and handing out loot takes no more than a minute at the end of a raid.
---
When I played Vanilla back in the day, limited world buffs were used for progression.
---
We would always have the 2 Orgrimmar buffs prepared, and we would port out to Org to get them for a progression fight that the dps would really help on.  On the harder bosses, we would use them for the first few kills.  For example, in the early raids we used them for Ragnaros, Razorgore (dps check when it launched) and Nefarian.
---
We didn't bother with the ZG buff until Naxx, where we only used it for progression.  We never used Darkmoon buffs.
---
&gt;Like I get every little helps but is it worth more then getting a few more pulls in on the boss?
---
You didn't get buffs for every pull.  You did it without buffs until you thought that you were close a few times, then got the buffs to try to push it over the edge.  We must have pulled some of these bosses 30+ times before we world buffed.
---
Hunters are tranq bots that provide a mobile 100 attack power buff, and that's the only reason they get brought to raids past BWL (due to their piss poor DPS as a result of bad scaling) so you get to play support in your own unique way.
---
Paladin: just boring in Vanilla. Auto attack to 60, then cast 1-heal in Raids.
---
Warrior/Rogue/Mage: I don't see the appeal in playing FOTM OP classes.
---
Blabla "me hurr and me durr" blabla. 
---
Next!
---
Thunderclaps a priest, seen all I need to see.
---
That's precisely the problem though...there's a notable chunk of folks saying they remember it that way...somebody has to be right and facts do not care about your "feels".
---
I am playing a horde warrior and want to have engineering at 60. 
---
What would be best to professions to have in the lead up to 60? I'm thinking enchanting with skinning and dropping skinning at 60 for engineering when I'm ready to make the switch.
---
Plan on using fishing for gathering and selling instance tanking runs as the primary source of income.
---
this guy is tanner from high school, I’m shocked he didn’t end his post with ... pathetic
---
You ask why, so I'll try to answer. Layering is only going to be in the game initially until it has served its purpose. Layering is there because blizzard wants really high server caps on the launch, talks of 5 even 10k player caps on each server, the reasoning for this is because classic is expected to have a lot of tourists since it's a pretty hyped game and essentially free for many (no base price and sub is linked to retail), but the game isn't for everyone. So to prevent servers dying out once the tourists leave, they want the initial high pop, and in order to sustain a high pop like that, some sort of sharding/layering system is.. I wouldn't say needed, but it certainly makes sense.
---
Dope
---
Hunter: Hate everything about hunter pets and ammo sucks
---
Warlock: Pets and shards suck
---
Rogue: Always despised Rogues for their world pvp shit. Such a cancerous class for scum. 
---
Shaman: Horde
---
Paladin: Most boring class in the game and Id rather heal with my priest
---
Competition for mobs in the first month is going to really happer the game for most people even with layering. Can't understand why these anti layering lot want it worse. The stress test server was bedlam.
---
NOCHANGES
---
I mean, you think a rerelease of a 10+ year old game was going to have the same experience?
---
You know what else wrecks a community? Unstable servers and lag during launch. Blizzard got away with it 15 years ago, fortunately, but now they are doing everything they can to prevent this.
---
We just cannot have a launch with servers lagging for days on end. The impact could be disastrous for your community. In fact, the community could be destroyed even before it got build properly.
---
oops
---
Yeah its quite annoying. I just want the game to come out so these people don't even have an audience to be entertained anymore.
---
&gt; But the way you're carrying on like vanilla required players get world buffs is just silly to me.
---
Ive never said anything close to that, i never claimed you needed them, i literally wrote in the comment you replied to:
---
&gt;If you dont want to waste time getting them, then just skip them.
---
I just said that if you dont like being lower on the dps meter then get the buff or stop whining.
---
I remember doing this too. not as far as the gnome, but def bein able to walk on the tree
---
Lol a void saccing lock is the easiest since u can dispell the shield. Good luck on a soul link felhunter Trying to dispell Sl on the pet Which has insane resistances. I love shadow priests and ive Mained one in all vanilla but a lock has all the tools to beat a spriest.
---
And this is why we need Transmog in WoW Classic!
---
Don't play until phase 2 - no layering and you can have your vanilla experience.
---
I pick 25000 people on a single server
---
because that's really what I want to see
---
DKP? I'd just start my own 5 man Strath groups and probably reserve that item.
---
Lol. Like those are the real life options.
---
Id rather have a bit of a queue than people morphing in and out of existance. World pvp is already dead.
---
U might be right, dunno :D
---
If you don't understand what philosophy means or think that philosophies don't account to people in a virtual world i don't think you can understand any logic really well. I don't have time to start educating you you in these concepts.
---
I mean, I don't really like world buffs either, but you can't possibly call them an *exploit.* That's insane. It's an intended feature deliberately put in the game by the developers. The main ones are obtained *by raiding.* You can't say that raiders using world buffs is somehow abuse of game mechanics. It literally is intended use of game mechanics. People used them back in the day as well, just not quite as systematically.
---
They won't work the same way in Classic as they did on private servers, either. There are some mechanical differences that largely prevent a whole raid from just stacking up all the world buffs and logging out to wait for the raid. The citywide buffs have a cooldown so you can't simply save an Onyxia head or whatever and trigger it right before the raid, and songflowers were completely different as well, you can't have a whole raid click on one flower to get the buff 40 times. That's most of the problem solved already without making any special changes.
---
The note about class parity is pointless. Whether or not some classes benefit more from world buffs than others, it's not something that changes anything at all. Raids don't pick their 40-man lineups based on which classes get the most out of world buffs. People won't start bringing more feral druids if world buffs are gone. That's silly.
---
I think you overrate the world buffs a little as well. They don't trivialize content that wasn't already trivial for you. If you're in a guild that has trouble raiding, world buffs don't suddenly change that into smooth sailing. It adds like 20% DPS to your raid but you lose it all if you wipe a single time, so unless you already clear raids without wiping, the impact isn't that great. It's not gonna turn a struggle into a speedrun.
---
And most importantly, something being unfun is not an argument for changing it. You know what's unfun? Half the specs in the game being crap. Class itemization that caters only to one spec. Whole segments of content being immune to some damage type. The ranking system. Loads and loads of things in vanilla are really awful for gameplay, yet they're part of what makes the game what it is. You can't say "change this because it's annoying." World buffs are a drop in the bucket of things that probably shouldn't have been the way that they are.
---
imagine thinking resisting roots beats resisting frost nova and a cd that makes you immune to poisons and bleeds
---
It looks like *Sunday* has come to the Classic WoW sub.
---
B-b-but ReD Is DeAd FoR ThE HoRdE
---
You are ignoring the fact that world buffs have not been used in raiding during vanilla. So technically they are not authentic to the experience.
---
Mages definitely won't be under represented. They've consistently been one of the top 3 most played classes on every single private server. They're one of the best DPS'ers, one of the best solo farmers at 60 and one of the best PvP classes.
---
I admire your bravery. If you don’t like the class you picked you’ll have wasted a humongous amount of time.
---
&gt;So stop posting bullshit and sayin' "a Hunter can't fight while moving"
---
I give up. My whole point is that people intentionally choose is misinterpret what is being said so they dont have to admit they are wrong, and then you come and do the exact same thing when literally nobody said they cannot "fight" while moving. Only that they cannot "shoot" which is 100% correct.
---
Thanks for proving my point.
---
agreed, and it makes me sad it's one of the most popular classes.
---
WTB energy-based dps class that doesn't have stealth.
---
Stats was like 10 years ago for me, but I think I recall 800 as being the number to shoot for where a survey becomes a totally relevant sample size. I could be remembering wrong, but that’s what it was for political polls.
---
if I don't get to redefine what words mean, then you agree with me that stacking world buffs in raids is technically an exploit, right? All of the people saying it isn't are just redefining what words mean.
---
Stop arguing slippery slope. Stacking world buffs and the toxicity of Pservers where *everything* revolves around that is going to make classic worse. People just really want to get a world buff and logout and play something else until raid, I guess.
---
I know the feeling dude!
---
I want to play a Human Warrior, but I also want to play an Undead Warlock. I was also thinking priest, but my friend is rolling Priest, so I'm choosing something else.
---
If we end up as Horde, and I end up as Warrior, I'm not sure if I want to roll Troll or Tauren....
---
still absolutely nothing   
---
my bfa mm hunt is many times more complicated with trying to maximize rapid fire haste buff, not overcap focus and not let aimed shot get 2 charges
---
And i guess their dots feel the same like guldans
---
hunter &gt; everything else
---
They would go by alot but dont waist your time farming them for like 6months after the servers are realized because no one going to spend loads of gold on it
---
IMO there's not a big difference. Both examples do not adhere to the class fantasy. The tauren is the race with fewest class options, and there's a reason rogue is not one of them.
---
World buffs are quite cancer IMO. This is why private servers disable them for first month of progression.
---
1.12 means 1.12 though. When Blizz release Classic+ in 2030, first thing they'll get rid of will be world buffs.
---
## Horizontal Progression through Set Bonuses
---
If there was new content added to Classic eventually, set bonuses could enough of an incentive to complete new dungeon/raid content.
---
If there were new dungeons and  T1, T2, T3 raids that dropped gear with new set bonuses, would that allow for enough customization? Some of the Molten Core sets offer pretty good set bonuses, and I wonder if set bonuses could be a way to offset the stat increases that T3 gear offers for example. If there was new Tier 2 raid similar to Blackwing Lair, it could drop new set bonuses that changed the way certain talents worked. This could make less viable specs more viable. If you wanted certain boosts to Ret or Boomkin, you could farm the new raid for the set. The issues with the vertical raid progression is that if attribute increases are all that matter, then higher tier drop gear is clearly better.
---
Naxxramas gear should remain top end. Adding new raids that increase the tier level beyond 3 creates problematic power creep. The solution is perhaps to add special set bonuses to gear from new raids, as well as bonuses that aren't just attribute differences. You have to create itemization that makes doing all the raid contet worth it, but at the same time doesn't invalidate the other raids. The issue of gear inflation is also something to consider. If you have 10-15 raids to choose from, then it could make it much easier to just stock up on epics. If the itemization is good enough that real character customization exists from collecting different raid tiers, then it could be ok.
---
You wanna know one of the reasons we ended up with the expansions? Because players were too busy posting #nochanges Blizzard-can-do-no-wrong lunacy on the WoW forums back in day. Instead of constructivy discussing the future of the WoW, players were sidetracked by nonsense.
---
I understand Classic will be #nochanges, but there are a lot of knowledgable and erudite posters here who might have solutions to advance the original game if and when thst times comes. Sure Blizzard might just drop #nochanges TBC on us, but at that point I'll be out.
---
## New Quests, Collectables, and Leveling Zones
---
Improving the leveling, quest, and farming experience in Classic WoW is something that new content patches could focus on. Have new questlines and storymodes for leveling zones. For every raid patch, there could be a patch that enhances other aspects of the game. Never underestimate how popular cosmetic/collectables are. There should be new mounts, recipes, etc.. that you can farm in post-naxx raids/dungeons/questlines. They probably keep BFA alive. Then of course improving the PvP system is also very important. Making World PvP a bigger aspect of Classic WoW.
---
## Player Housing
---
Finally bring player housing to WoW with a new content patch. Allow players to collect and assemble items to deck out their houses.
---
## World PvP System
---
Instead of adding Arena to Classic WoW, add a new system where players players can viably rank up through World PvP. A huge flaw with Classic WoW is how battlegrounds become the main focus of PvP. You can't really rank up doing World PvP once battlegrounds are released. They need to either create a separate honor system where you only rank up doing world PvP with a leaderboard or increase the honor gains from World PvP. Add more objectives and resources to collect. Add unique chests and rewards hidden across zones so players leave the capital cities to find them.
---
## Event System
---
Player-run PvP/PvE events that are supported by Blizzard. Speed runs, ironman runs, dueling tournaments, Roleplaying games etc..
---
## New Classic Races
---
Add Worgen and Goblin to the game. They were heavily featured in Classic WoW, therefore Lost Isles and Gilneas would be good additions.
---
## Boats
---
Allow players to construct their own boats and sail across the seas of Azeroth.
---
Some ideas for patch content here
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c0rogx/my\_take\_on\_the\_classic\_post\_naxx\_contentmassive/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c0rogx/my_take_on_the_classic_post_naxx_contentmassive/)
---
Yeah I got this vibe as well when I realised that classic will be released within months or weeks of 8.2.  Kinda seems like a full proof plan to make sure BFA looks as popular as possible.  Sneaky snakes up at Activision HQ.
---
&gt;people morphing in and out of existance. World pvp is already dead.
---
It's really not that big a deal, if done correctly you should hardly ever notice it. That's the goal and that's partly what the beta is working on.
---
Also, blizzard rather wants that, than queues, and they decide.
---
Yeah, or you could just merge servers when tourists leave..? Like they did in classic.
---
No we don’t.
---
They still haven't fixed rogue stealth walk, the checkered box in WPL, flight paths dropping people randomly, etc. They have a lot of kinks to work out.
---
We’re getting Blizzlike server populations, so yeah. That’s just stupid.
---
No. The entire reason that it doesn't have its own, seperate subscription is so they don't have to explain to investors why their 15 year old remake has more players and beyter engagmenet than their abomination of retail.
---
Well thats the point right? To make it as close as possible
---
Skarm, who was on Tips Out's feral deep dive, said that he saw a feral druid do top DPS on kel'thuzad. So as long as you're putting in the effort to farm full consumes and pummelers, you can definitely pull your weight.
---
With hardly any architecture. 
---
You can make amazing addons with little to no formal knowledge, but as complexity increases you will need an amazing ammount of formal training.
---
Priest, for me.
---
If I was healing as Holy, I'd rather play a Resto Shaman.  If I was DPSing as Shadow, I'd rather play a Warlock or Mage.
---
I'll probably level one a bit in Classic just because they're the single class I never had much play time on, but I just don't get the appeal.
---
Also:
---
Quin- ret
---
Cdew- enhance
---
&gt; just for some of phase 1
---
*Just* potentially for a few months...
---
Ahhhh okays.
---
Im guessing you mean sub rogue, combat is only good in pve
---
Sorry I forgot to do that quest :P
---
But what faction/race?
---
No. Investors will get the numbers as they always have. It's the general public they stopped giving numbers to.
---
Two months later, beta bugs don’t get fixed on launch
---
Spider-Man: *Wait, that’s illegal.*
---
Causes more long-term issues, like potential inability to play with your favorite name.
---
A little wrong. Before 1.9, no other cities except Ironforge and Orgrimmar *had* an Auction House.
---
Mining, you need lots of ore, stone, and green gems to level engineering. So make sure you save those green gemstones too.
---
shaman has higher skill floor because you have 10 totems and you need to keybind the ones you need for whatever class your going against or whatever situation. 
---
While ghost wolfing to get distance and using proper shocks
---
Personally, I recommend an undead or orc warrior.
---
Orc has that 25% stun resistance which can save your life in a pinch in PvP, and your axe bonus meshes perfectly with arms for PvP. Orc also allows you great dps in pve, your active racial is the best for warriors, and the bonus to axes can make edgemasters unneeded in certain circumstances. Remember, glancing blows lower your damage by 30%, and having 10 weapon skill over the cap makes them not occur on the appropriate mobs. Human is recommend for the same reason. 
---
Undead makes a wonderful warrior in PvP because your active racial is one of the best in the game. They're also great in PvE because the same racial can save your bacon, and cannibalize can reduce downtime quite a bit - which is a godsend for warriors because you have probably the worst road to sixty in the game. More time Underwater is also situationally useful for questing. While you'll do a LITTLE less damage than an orc at 60, the road getting their is much easier as undead. Plus, I think they're the coolest horde race. If I wasn't sold on a human paladin already, I'd be rocking an undead warrior named Fortesque 
---
I suggest warrior because it's a plate wearer (like pally) and a ton of fun. Youre the best tank, you're one of the best DPS, and you're a monster in group PvP. Your biggest weakness is solo content and the road to 60, but if you were going to play paladin you would've been mentally preparing for the same problems. 
---
Ultimately, just go with whatever race/class combo looks the best to you. The racial differences aren't large enough to prevent you from getting raid slots, and whatever class you play will be fun (except hunters i hate them). 
---
Good luck!
---
I have a good friend who heals and I was tanking on my warrior in some BFA dungeon. I was tanking slow and methodically vanilla style and my friend who is the healer started pulling because I wasn't going fast enough and we wiped a few times because of it. And I struggled the whole time to keep everything under control. I chewed him out afterwards and told him this crap is why nobody wants to tank anymore. I haven't played BFA since.
---
You won't get my battlerez you better be friends with warlocks to soulstone you 😡
---
Classic had a steady and constant  increase of playerbase 
---
https://i.imgur.com/nabkKDF.jpg
---
Classic playerbase is gonna look more like WoD.
---
The amount of merges needed would be crazy, and merges are just as messy and ruining of the vanilla experience.
---
Are you saying that word buffs were in the game by accident? You mean there wasn't a developer who were told to make world buffs in the game? I am pretty sure they intentionally made world buffs available available for players in the game so it was intended. Unbelieveable how fucking idiot person has to be not to understand such a simple concept.
---
Huh what's this layering thing? I haven't heard of it yet. Maybe we need 15+ topics per day about it
---
You think you don’t, but you do.
---
Hell yeah!
---
Seems pretty noticable on the beta. Also just smaller things like being in Orgrimmar/Ironforge and running into known people.
---
Now theyre making 5-10k servers with layering according to a comment here? So everyone except your group will just be a random face. 
---
Way to ruin the community imo.
---
And yeah i did notice that blizzard decides.
---
&gt;:p
---
Don't be dumb. We are talking about world buff stacking.
---
But you’re complaining that the experience isn’t going to be real. It’s never going to be real
---
Haha don't appeal to play but very much to play with 😂
---
Soul link locks aren’t giving me any problem, they don’t do enough damage, I don’t need to dispell anything, they die.
---
Thotbot.com
---
I've been a shaman main for 11 years, you don't need to convince me.
---
Your reasoning is flawed.
---
The rogue still does more DPS. If you remove world buffs you just lowered the raids overall damage significantly and now there's even less room for Hybrids as you have to make up for the lost damage by stacking meta-classes.
---
Broken tooth has a 1.0 attack speed but overall damage is the same as any other cat. Meaning itll hit softer but faster
---
No(but other things can proc off command), yes, yes, not sure about spell damage.
---
Yeah it would've been cool to have the totems like around you similar to lightning shield or something.
---
It is gonna be that way until phase 3 tho. As a mage main that means I too will be buying water most of the beginning year
---
Oh look. Another post about the same topic. Yes we all agree layering sucks. It's not permanent. It's just for initial launch.
---
I miss when we used to complain about streamers. I wonder what our next complaint will be.
---
A typo, haha.
---
I am sorry but i am not the one who haves problems with simple concepts.
---
Just a two timer here, (both in Cata s9 and s10), but I felt that Cata struck a good balance. Matches could drag if you were bad but you just needed that one good moment of ability alignment and opponent vulnerability (making a mistake) and boom you could capitalize.
---
I also played a rogue so I and smoke bomb and played shadowdance so that probably colors my experience though.
---
Horde has been winning in terms of Large Scale WPvP battles.
---
The reason it's noticable on the beta is because it's an entirely new system that they are working on improving... Yes the initial pop of the servers will be around that until the population fades, and layering is removed 1-3 months after launch. 
---
Also each layer has 3k pop, you won't be alone.
---
Sorry, a glaring typo. Meant to make it seal twisting.
---
Why are you comparing bfa to classic?
---
Feels bad man =/
---
Trolls have clunky animations but the raptors are damn cool.
---
Servers were absolutely loaded the first months of vanilla. Much more than blizzard expected
---
I’m fairly sure spell power increases the damage of seal of command
---
As close as possible..
---
I like how Alliance players are down voting this because it upsets them. You can't dispute the fact that Horde have won more Large Scale WPvP battles.
---
"#NOCHANGES but " everywhere on this fucking reddit
---
I'd play classes or races I usually wouldn't pick when it's released, just in order to test them and don't have to "replay" them in release. And I think it's fun to play on an not perfect implementation of WoW Classic. And the level caps lead to some experience that won't exist in the release. I mean, as far as I know modern WoW players, most of them will rush through to 60 as fast as possible. However, with lvl caps on 30, 40 and so, there literally was new content, new difficult npc that were like bosses, doing high lvl dungeons with low level, the ability to gather gear for a lower lvl without getting a lvl up which enables you to wear stronger gear, and a whole new endcontent talent and ability usage. I mean, there were probably a lot of people going for cross talent tree builds during level cap, because they were probably stronger.
---
Exactly. That’s what layering is doing...
---
I was planning on buying all the mats necessary from the AH to be honest. But the stone and gems I find along the way I'll keep hold of on a bank.
---
Dude you're in the wrong thread. Nobody is talking about private servers or Alterac Valley here. Go troll somewhere else.

The dwarves' relationship with the divine has always been weird. Made weirder as the story went on, with there being dwarves who worship *the Titans.* But then the Dark Iron dwarves, who (as of vanilla lore) never were part of the Alliance and had no real relationship with the humans, had light-worshiping priests. Did they discover the Holy Light on their own? Wouldn't it have been more natural for them to have priests to Ragnaros?
---
In general trying to think about the faith of these races is weird. In terms of mages, I think if dwarves *had* mages no one really would've batted an eye, in the end. Not any weirder than troll mages, when you think about it.
---
&gt;They won't but I've heard shadow oil and other consumable buffs will, until they fix it.
---
Of course they are not going to start nerfing items that worked a certain way in Vanilla. Shadow Oil cast Rank 3 Shadow Bolt, which scales at 56% of spellpower.
---
The damage difference between those and poisons in a raid where the rogue use Supreme Power, Elixir of Shadow Power and Greater Arcane Elixir is something like 2%.
---
You will have to be an idiot to think this is something they will nerf.
---
Yes of course they were, but the population stayed as you can clearly see. That's not expected to happen in classic because the game is open to a lot more and classic isn't for everyone.
---
I’ll just have to reply to a few things myself.
---
On the Swifty thing - I never said he was never having fun. He definitely was. But that comment made it seem like after about 2 1/2 hours, he was ready for it to be over. As was I. If I’m playing a massive sized battleground like AV, I want it to play out a while. But days long? No. Absolutely not. People also didn’t like it because after a while, it was just you killing others with no benefits. Killing the same player multiple times reduces the amount of honor you receive. So if that’s all you’re doing, you’re just PvP’n to PvP. Which is cool and all, but serious PvPers, people who want rep, people who wanna actually win or playing other BGs won’t enjoy it as much.
---
The battleground poll - A lot of people did not like it. I don’t get why people refuse to believe it. They see a large group of people on a subreddit commenting that they loved it, but don’t account for the 10+ million other people who played Classic WoW when it came out and had their opinion on the BG as well. Day long BGs are not fun. It’s simple. When you have an objective and it takes half a day or even DAYS to reach that objective, it becomes boring. There needs to be a decent time set up for it, like a 2-3 hour BG average.
---
People loved the old AV - if that’s the case, then why do pserver players only play AV when it’s AV weekend, and they do the rush to the boss to get the game over with? It’s not because that’s how it’s supposed to be played. If players really wanted the tug of war style battle with day long BGs and such, they’d make it happened regardless of how the game plays out. However the players don’t want it that way because they don’t play it that way.
---
And you say I’m delusional.
---
You don't even know what the hell your talking about, bye.
---
No not at all.
---
Not for me it won't.
---
IIRC shamans were meant to be tanks in beta.
---
Imagine having three different talent trees in a class and wanting all three of them to be more or less equally viable
---
the absolute mad lads
---
This is an interesting strategy... I'm getting some  backpay soon and could probably get a laptop! Good luck sir.
---
You pick a class yet? I'm torn between hunter and mage... I was a newb kid as a hunter and didnt even realize how to  train pets!
---
I tried and I sucked at it lol. It looked like shit.
---
I’ve never played a warrior. Classicdb says wrecklessnes causes most attacks to be crits. So it makes all attacks guarantee crit or raises chance by a %?
---
I played in said guilds, they weren't. Nihilum using world buffs to kill the last boss of the entire game is not "extensively".
---
Who hurt you man? You’re out here assuming shit about others. I’ll give it a try. Spend some time with your father today he misses the old you.... before throwing temper tantrums and locking yourself in your room for days.
---
they are releasing the game like it was back then, not like it felt back then. if they were to recreate the experience itself they would need to change a few broken things that are just common knowledge by now...
---
fuck no
---
It's not even about the matches being quick. I wouldn't mind playing an hour long AV if it was actually fun throughout, but 45 minutes of attrition at \[insert AV chokepoint of choice here\] just feels dull after the spectacle of it fades.   
---
I really enjoy the side skirmishes AV can bring, the 'psuedo world pvp' of running into a straggler in the field of strife, or flanking fights that only have a handful of people on either side fighting over a GY. I just don't think the "giant fights in the middle for hours on end" is nearly as enjoyable as some people make it out to be.
---
Yo I think I know a game that offers that
---
Holy shit I’ve played this game as a mage since 2005 and never noticed that
---
Oh vanilla wow had millions of players logging in and doing the starting zone all at the same time???
---
Is this the same Enclave I know from Planetside 2?
---
And the healing OH is better than anything in BWL, on par with Sartura's OH. The dps OH is also better than anything in BWL for Warlocks, only superceded by the Twin Emps OH. 
---
You get the most rep by just zerging through and either win or lose instead of just turtling for 5 hours.
---
Might as well just implement LFG and LFR then
---
Lol yeah. I totally forgot about that.
---
We are also needed to ninja pull every bug in AQ40 and roll on all the cloth.
---
It'd have to have been different, like the Running Wild that came with Worgen in Cataclysm. Actual Plainsrunning was HORRIBLY awkward. It took ten full seconds to kick in and was stopped by being *tapped.*
---
Same roll also, at least for healers and tanks
---
Actually, Blizzard has shown that each layer can hit 5k pop.
---
So that’s a minimum of 20k people per realm.
---
I'm one of the rare breed of people that actually loved Lawbringer's design, like I think I always even liked it more than the Judgment redesign. Not a fan of skirts.
---
Professions are great to add extra help for what you're doing. Alchemy for potions for raids and dungeons, tailoring you can make some great gear for yourself. blacksmiths can make one of the best helmets ect ect. You're not required to have one by any means but I would recommend to do them. At the very least have first aid!
---
Engineering is fantastic for PvP, if you're planning on a rank14 grind it's basically needed, I will say this sub makes too much of a big deal about it imo because it is not necessary really outside of that.

Alliance guild &lt;Nether&gt; was light-years ahead of the server on progression. I remember a fellow mage Xerel who was always decked in t3. I was probably a top 10 mage on the server and wayyyy behind this guy.
---
Horde guild &lt;Tact&gt; wrecked in PvP and since we were BG9 these guys went in hard. Hated looking at the scoreboard and seeing we were playing a premade of them. Sen'Jin alliance didn't have a great PvP presence, a couple rank 14s that were beasts but nothing like Tact
---
They eventually all 3 got mailed to you, I know at the start you had to hand in a quest and pick one but later on they gave them all. I hope we get all 3, rip if not
---
Ok now you’re just trolling. Imagine saying “I want the vanilla experience, crash the servers, make it impossible to play” and wanting to be taken seriously.
---
This post is the single best source of information I've read on how to pally tank dungeons at 60, thanks a bundle for writing it up. If I could give you reddit gold, I would.
---
I'll take you up on your offer and ask you a couple more questions. Hand of Edward the Odd - think it might be a decent tanking weapon? Or too gimmicky?
---
And [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/AzPUwAQ_p8xxAA) is the build I'm thinking of going with at 60. It's intended to be viable for casual raid healing (with Illumination) and tanking 5-mans. I went with 2/2 Guardian's Favor for more BoPs as a pseudotaunt, 3/3 Imp HoJ for more stuns to deal with caster mobs/if I lose threat on a mob. Couldn't decide between Toughness and Anticipation, so I just went with more armor.
---
LET ME IN
---
LET ME INNNNNNNNNNNNN
---
Well it's important to keep in mind the census is drastically different based on PVE/PVP status. Here is one list I found
---
For Allies at level 60: 
---
* Mage 20.6
---
 
---
* Warrior 15.4
---
* Rogues 14.4
---
* Hunters 12.4
---
* Paladins 12
---
* Priests 9.7
---
* Warlocks 8.9
---
* Druids 6.8
---
For Horde at 60
---
* Mages 21.6
---
* Warriors 16.1
---
* Rogues 15.5
---
* Hunters 12.8
---
* Priest 10.3
---
* Warlock 9.8
---
* Shaman 8.9
---
* Druid 4.9

All you have to do to "Preserve" the experience is to LEAVE IT ALONE. Let people buff who want to, and for those who dont, wont.
---
It's the "reeeee, it's an exploit because I dont like it." crowd that is causing such a fuss over it.
---
Get over yourselves. "I dont like having to farm tribute and songflowers." You don't have to! 
---
"My dps will be x% lower and that makes me feel bad." Well boo freaking hoo. Are the bosses dying anyways? Are you having FUN? Go join, or better yet, create a guild that doesn't prioritize world buffs. That way you can play how you want to.
---
I specifically will GM a guild that's like this if I cannot find one amongst my friends. Why? Because this "problem" has the easy fix of quit cryin and go make your own group to have fun.

Lots of bombs and stuff, good for pvp. And gadgets. God I love the gadgets
---
That rogue is from TBC. No wonder he's so good in Classic.
---
So 90 servers and a cap of 100,000 players at peak on day 1?
---
Cool.
---
Paladin - I dislike how it levels, and all its specs at 60. Fudge those tiny blessings and spam of light.
---
Rogue - Hipster reasons, and cuz I aint no light foot coward!
---
 That rogue is from TBC. No wonder he's so good in classic.
---
Strong feeling you're in the extreme minority there bud.
---
A holy paladin who only presses 1-2 heal buttons in PvP is terrible. If your not using freedoms, sac, bop, hoj, engineering items etc you might as well carry a sign that says “free kill”
---
addons is not classic

I have a background on my desktop, would that help?

Roll a mage. Get him to 60, farm some gold and then level your warrior. Best way
---
&gt; Because trying to compete with hundreds or thousands of players for tags on the first week is going to save the game. 
---
Isn't this the forced socialization that you miss oh so dearly?

Vanilla had 90 servers and a peak of 100,000 on day 1.
---
A completely optional cosmetic feature that’s available to everyone? Fuck yes!
---
Oh, i want a consistent server community sorry. 
---
Its 15 years ago and i would prefer a queue.
---
Just play BFA and use the LFR

How do guillds determine who gets 2 handers on alliance side? As an alliance warrior you won't be using a 2 hander in raids, so how do you convince the raid to give you one?

How about female leaders with a twist? Sure the GoT was worse in the last episode( breaker of chains to civilian BBQ, and angsty undead lich king nemesis to raid boss), but still questionable writing at best, and just beating on female power characters.
---
15 years ago
---
I mean, you sorta can be still. The issue is more what you can/cannot cast in which form. Like cat, bear and moonkin cant cast any heals but Regrowth, but both cat and bear can spec into using Moonfire in their shapeshift forms. But if our tank dies in a 5 man I can shift into bear form, taunt and hold threat while I brez the tank myself or another party member does. Obviously feral isnt as versatile as it used to be, where your tank was catweaving for dps when not holding threat.
---
&gt;Well that is the pessimist point of view. Let's hear a realistic one please.
---
actually. he is 100% right. You are wrong. The minute blizzard added honor kill system and rank 14, this also coincided with the release of the addon that let people group up together in AV premades. I was able to regularly take part in horde premade AV's that would fill up 35-38 of the 40 slots with our people.  
---
both teams would literally run past each other. and it became a dps race to the towers/graveyards/boss. it was win or lose in 10 minutes or less. Even taking a loss every 10 minutes was more honor in the long run than battling 1 AV for hours and hour and winning. It wasn't AV being nerfed that caused this. It was a change of tactics made by honor cartels to promote an environment conducive to getting rank 14.  
---
here is strat posted in 2008 clearly explaining what I am saying.  
---
 [https://www.ownedcore.com/forums/world-of-warcraft/world-of-warcraft-guides/92292-av-premade-how-win-horde.html](https://www.ownedcore.com/forums/world-of-warcraft/world-of-warcraft-guides/92292-av-premade-how-win-horde.html)   
---
here is the guy explaining why defense is meaningless.  
---
&gt; So, group 1 and 2 should kill Balinda (62 honor) fast and then go back to IB and TP to recap them before they get destroyed by the alliance. Winning with those 2 towers will give you an extra 180 honor.  
---
&gt;Group 3 should cap SH bunker, defend it untill it's destroyed and then go help Dun Baldar, aid station and all. Same for IW group 4.  
---
&gt;Group 5 goes to DB south and group 6 to DB north and then help Aid Station.  
---
&gt;Group 7 &amp; 8 should cap aid station ASAP, capping aid station BEFORE SP is very important. Aid station is so much more important then SP. You can cap SP after Aid Station if you want, but we usualy don't do that.  
---
&gt;You should also NEVER cap SH GY. If you do, alliance will rez at SP or aid station and you will get shitloads of alliance defending, you don't want that.  
---
&gt;Ok, so when IW and SH are down and IB/TP are being recapped I ask for timers on DB bunkers. When there is \~20 sec left on those bunkers I tell everyone to go in (ALL IN) and to start nuking van. Having a tank helps alot here. When van dies and you destroyed all alliance bunkers and you recapped IB and TP you should have around 500 bonus honor in about 10-15 minutes.   
---
&gt; EDIT: I had some questions about people asking why there is no defence. I'll explain why you don't need defence with this tactic. Horde can rush up to aid station so fast that we cap it 5 minutes before alliance start drek. This give us enough time to kill Van with 25+ people dpsing him. So yeah, no defence needed here.
---
Raid speedrun records are pretty competitive in the top end.
---
You're right. For some reason I thought it was from MC. I can't remember what I'm thinking of.
---
You can get world buffs on your own, but a raid requires 40 players to sync their schedules and pray nothing unexpected comes up during the few hours the raid last.
---
If you can reduce this time and thus reduce the probability that someone lose focus, disconnect, need to leave or whatever then why wont you?
---
Pepega just dont do it if you dont want to Pepega
---
Now really how the community is going to work once this cat gets out of the bag.
---
no, not at all. im talking about things like warri dps doubling other dps speccs and DM goldfarms being so obviously broken you can easily farm 100g+ per hour. Did you watch private server battlegrounds? they are full of skips, wallglitching and oher soft exploits/bugs.
---
Back then everything was new and these things didnt impact the game that much, now everybody and their mother knows about DM goldfarm. Epic mount used to be something special, right? now its 10hours of grinding away! 
---
there are things even privateserver nerfed, like the goldfarm above or items like HoJ...
---
Paladins always carry the “free kill” sign. They keep it in the same pocket as their Bubble Hearth macro.
---
I just want to play something other than a builder-spender, but that’s all the melee classes are these days (and even some casters!). I miss the time before everything became Rogue Lite
---
Except literally half the comments mention private servers and the OP's original video is talking about taking mechanics from private servers.

I'm not computer-savvy but if I was you I'd get a trial account for retail. If you can run it smooth on low-medium, classic max should be aight.
---
Minimum? Where are you getting that there *will* be four layers? Just because they can handle that doesn’t mean they will.
---
Blizzard has said Blizzlike caps, meaning 3-3.5k pop.
---
Ok?
---
Do some research before making a post next time. If you think layering is going to effect server community then you need to do some reading.
---
Paid server transfers.
---
They were a thing toward the end of vanilla with a long cooldown.
---
Any confirmation on their inclusion in classic?
---
And once again my victory is flawless.
---
Thank you. For some reason googling this wasn't bringing anything up.
---
Alas, I'm no sport-guy. At least the things you mentioned aren't fun for me, and especially not when doing them alone. I'd wish I'd live on a farm with some animals and my own dog, nice nature, big forests, wild animals. However, I'm living in a city and am bound to it. When I have enough money, I'll move away. Scandinavia, Alaska, Canada, Poland. Something like that \^\^
---
Why is that best? 
---
Why not just level my warrior and then make a mage alt when I have the time?
---
Nobody did it sure but it was in the game and it's not pserver players that are trying to bring it to classic simply we know the game better so we will use this knowledge to play better.
---
I don't want to log out for a day, I would prefer the game that way, but it was in Vanilla so it has to be in Classic.
---
I think the shitstorm Blizzard is getting now would be better than the shitstorm they would get at release if they hadn't added layering. Imagine thousands of people cramped in the same zones trying to do the same quests, day-long queues, I bet many people would be turned away from the game if that were to happen, it's just the more hardcore crowd that wants to get rid of layering completely.
---
I'm also not a fan of layering but I do believe that it's good for the game's health and the amount of people playing it in the long term. Especially when they get rid after phase 1.
---
Cool. So what's your solution then?
---
1,800 - 3,000 servers or 14-18 hour queues?
---
Usually they're worth more.

It's not optional if you want to speak remotely well. Commas actually make a difference in what is being said in the sentence. It can actually change the meaning of the sentence. So, no, it is not optional.

We're only up to season 7. Retail can get worse.
---
Enough servers would be nice.
---
You can and possibly will. Your 2h fury spec will be around improved slam and making sure to only dump that rage right after a white swing lands, so as not to interrupt weapon swing.
---
Also, they'll like having less competition on 1h weapons. And there aren't really other options for 2h weapons. Ret pallys, yes, but any guild letting rets play won't question you using a 2h.
---
Sure, some gear combinations have always been broken in PvP. But have many realistically had that in your battlegroup? 2-3 teams max?
---
add weekly decay on points built up. this is prevent people from skipping obvious ugprades hoarding points.
---
I was on Staghelm and they didn't merge Staghelm for a long ass time. And even then, the 5 realms combined were STILL low pop.. I rerolled because it ruined the experience for me.
---
Its not just about defending one thing, its also about when do we stop after the first change has been made? Like I also hate that its going to take me fucking months to rank to r14 just to be able to get some epic weapons but you dont see me asking for Blizzard to completely rework the ranking system, because that would be fucking stupid and not true to how it was in vanilla.

---
Just to add to Geofunk's solid response, weapon speed, dps, damage and even weapon skill (e.g. 100/110 maces) have no effect on feral combat. Weapons are essentially stack sticks.
---
The biggest problem with world buffs is it encourages you not to play once you get them. Most people aren't going to collect world buffs on raid day, so you get them and then stop playing until raid time. What if I actually wanted to keep playing on that character? Too bad, can't waste the world buffs.
---
Sure, let’s ban all consumables too. Make it Retail Arena rules. /s

&gt;Instant respawn.
---
Mobs should have 5 min respawn.
---
&gt; Juju Flurry: 45 second cooldown and stacks up to 20 times
---
Flurry has 20 sec duration and 1 minute cooldown. Impossible to stack.
---
&gt; This is MASSIVE in your DPS. 
---
It's single digit DPS increase. 0.7% increase on my current Pre-BIS spreadsheet. I'll be farming them, but less than 1% is not massive.
---
I always told the Tank: Look at my Mana Bar... This Blue thing you dont know anything about... it's your fking Health so let me reg between your Kamikaze Charges, if you are willing to survive.
---
Agree with this. I honestly think it's a lack of understanding to what the layering is actually going to be. As it's been mentioned it's only the first phase and I for one is quite pleased they're doing it. Imagine the packs of people in elwynn waiting for princess or gold tooth to respawn? Aslong as it's only implemented to starting and maybe secondary zones I can live with that.
---
Or you get them the day before. Or the day before that.
---
Skinning is pretty much a waste in classic if you're not a leatherworker.
---
Private servers got a lot of the tuning wrong, so mobs in classic drop way more stuff, the aggro ranges are usually smaller, and there's usually less downtime than in private servers. Bags are also much less common. This kind of upends the established best strategies, especially for skinning because you have more than enough vendor trash to sell, and your bag is full most of the time.
---
Gathering professions are both easier and harder in classic. Nodes are much easier to grab in classic than in private servers, but with the massive population we are going to have that means they're all going to be depleted 
---
So all this info means, that especially for a warlock, skinning is a waste and tailoring is amazing. Tailoring benefits you alot because you can make bags cheaper than the vendors sell, and make a bunch of silver early on selling 10 slot bags. Bags are much more valuable since they drop less frequently. Also, because of the rarity of gathering nodes in the first few months tailoring is perfect because humanoids drop the stuff you need.
---
Cooking and fishing are definitely worthwhile in classic because those resources are not going to be difficult to get. The buffs from cooking are especially good for the effort put in. First aid won't be as important for a warlock because you need your stuff for tailoring.
---
Gathering professions are usually the best moneymakers, especially when leveling up, but the super high population and ease of getting nodes will change things. Enchanting as always is a waste to level as you level up. Since tailoring has no needed gathering skill, you can fill that second slot with anything. A big thing to note is that mining is going to be by far the most difficult gathering skill to level up intially because of the huge competition. Herbalism won't be so bad because of the high density of herbalism nodes in general. Engineering is a money sink and I don't recommend anyone except warriors and paladins level that as they level up. Blacksmithing is a big money sink because of the rarity of ores, but alchemy won't be as bad as the rest early on just because of how abundant herbalism nodes are so prices on AH will be low, but again any crafting profession early on is a money sink.
---
So I really recommend either tailoring/herbalism or tailoring/alchemy for a warlock. Herbalism will definitely make you more money from selling stuff to other players, but alchemy will provide you some much needed buffs. If I had to pick between the two of go tailoring/herbalism while leveling just because more gold is better when leveling, but you should definitely level cooking and fishing because the resources aren't hard to get and the buffs are extremely useful. First aid is a luxury for you.
---
I'll edit in the link to the video that I got alot of this info from

---
When you hear people talk about world buffs, you understand why people want them.
---
World buffed guild mate vs non world buffed guildmate will never perform better. Which says loot council. Which says your personal character progression.
---
It's not really about helping the guild. It's about helping yourself have the highest DPS/etc to get prio on loot. It's a competition vs your guildmates.
---
Oh common... I’m not even anti layering and I call bull shit on this string of statements of yours.
---
&gt; I'm also not a fan of layering but I do believe that it's good for the game's health and the amount of people playing it in the long term. Especially when they get rid of it after phase 1.
---
Agreed. It's the best bad answer to a question with only bad answers.
---
))
---
Why do some people give a shit what others want to play?
---
So do the right thing and play a shaman
---
There is no way it is not going to affect the server community. 10k plus players per server? Layers at 3k a pop?
---
Whats the chance to run into some dude you did a quest with yesterday? Or to recognize a horde player you fought before?
---
You really knew people on your server back in vanilla. Not just your guild.
---
Made the game so much more immersive.
---
My main was a hunter, I loved it, played it hardcore till Cata. But also loved healing on a shammy. Thinking of starting with a shammy and then leveling a hunter....for gold farming later. 
---
But then I did love the hunter. So still not made my mind up but it is defo between these two classes.
---
Are BiS the same for PVE and PVP?
---
Ok. Good contribution. But you’re gonna have to think a little bit more than “bull shit” for a reason I’m wrong.
---
Yea I also enjoyed to tank back in the days, imo wotlk was the last good expansion for me
---
I've played alot of pservers and when we had shamans in our group I always wound up saying "why do we always get these nototem shammys?!"
---
Cause people just don't do it. I did it though :D once you get windfury at 32 it's a must for the melee units
---
Hello good sir comad,  
---
This is a replacement music choosen by youtube. You know, copyright things. I did not bother too much selecting something else
---
No, fucking, changes. Quit trying to alter the game. Let it be as it was so we can experience it again. Tired of these types of posts. Wait until after the game has been out for a while to start whining about ruining it.
---
&gt;people keep forgetting the 24h cooldown on world buffs.
---
Nobody is forgetting anything because there's no proof world buffs are on such a long cooldown at all.
---
Onyxia is the only buff we know for a fact has a cooldown and its something like 6 hours.
---
Diremaul buffs have no cooldown. Songflower respawn every 20-30 min and can be found in multiple locations, and there's no evidence ZG buff has a cooldown either.
---
It's really fascinating how people keep repeating nonsense as if it was fact.
---
Has nothing to do with what people want to play. Its about people advocating for changes on these specs without considering the ramifications it will have.
---
I mean, most people have stuff to do in the summer. And summer is also the sunny time.
---
Best time for gaming is dark winter! :D
---
R14 is a reward for just playing the game though, not something that may become a requirement for high end raiding just to even participate.
---
Warriors, Mages and Rogues. I just dislike the class fantasy. I guess i could play them as twinks but never as my main
---
And while there's no real advantage to taking such a risk, Druids have tanked Nefarion successfully. [Here's a clip from 2006, timestamped to the Druid class call.](https://youtu.be/e5SN5qAEaNU?t=553)
---
Hmm. I know it was capped at 40 in the closed beta for a good while. They might have increased it to 60 later on.
---
Hunter, Rogue, Warlock all don't really appeal to me.
---
oshitdatme, what do you mean? I do not understand this comment
---
I personally don't think it's worth leveling fishing and cooking on alts, but I bet some people here think it is. I guess it depends on how you'd like to enjoy your alt. If your main has capped fishing/cooking and all the recipes, I don't see a reason to do it on an alt unless you really love the completionist feel and/or you feel leveling these things will benefit that alt specifically. (Hunter with fishing can feed pets, but like...you can buy cooked regular meat from vendors too, so...)
---
I think leveling with Tailoring/Ench will slow you down but only if you're sitting in capital cities or grinding for materials for really long periods of time. IIRC there are a couple parts in the profession which require more cloth than you'll have by just questing-leveling, but say if you're a mage farming this would be easy-mode and maybe even part of your leveling experience by default.
---
Enchanting is one of those things that might be worth having as you level to DE unwanted green quest gear, but which I wouldn't actually hard-focus on leveling until I hit the cap. (Just bank the mats as you go.) That said, if you're not in a super big hurry to level enchanting anyway, waiting until 60 could allow you to make some decent side-money with skinning—or you could send skins to a LWer alt to help level that, as leather might be abundant on the AH due to the sheer amount of people playing and posting stuff they got while leveling.
---
It’s 2 layers per continent, which is the minimum.
---
I’d rather trust what Blizzard does than what Blizzard says.
---
I really don't recommend skinning. Alot of the guides recommending skinning are outdated because any made in the past 10 years have to reuse info or do the research on private servers, where the tuning got alot of things wrong. Let me grab the link showing some differences.
---
Congrats. 90% are now dead.
---
Your server got merged with the server your exwife / boss / 2,000 fourteen year olds / Asmongold plays on. You know, the one you purposefully did NOT roll on. Have fun.
---
Damn. You sound exactly like my psychologist. 
---
Our greater goal as a collective **was** to compete with other guilds on clear speeds etc. That means stepping up individually and become more coordinated and structured as a whole. When you clear MC for the 100th time, the sense of accomplishment you speak of changes. You set goals for yourself to keep it interesting. Vanilla raiding does get very repetitive, so most people that don't do this, just stops raiding. It's the same reason weight lifters keep track of PRs, runners record the fastest times an so on. To get a sense of progression and accomplishment as you say.  I believe this sense of progression and accomplishment is a vital part of anything you do long-term. Be it in real life or in a video game. And vanilla WoW just happens to have a big social aspect to it, that makes you want to stick around for a while. At least that's how I feel.
---
Ah... I misunderstood. I can relate to that.
---
Except that they were - not by many, but they were. World buffs are just as important to the true vanilla experience as anything else.
---
Yeap everybody has combo points.
---
Mana management? Gone outside of Arcane.
---
Snapshotting? Gone outside of Feral (I think)
---
Guess it'd just easy to balance this way.
---
Coldhearted daggers from Razorfen for that sweet slow/immobilize effect
---
Nothing about layering  has anything to do with the vanilla experience.  It’s completely contradictory to it.
---
And for the record, I’m absolutely fine with that.  But arguing that it some how helps replicate the vanilla experience is asinine.
---
The jokes on you, I don't make friends.
---
It's funny that wall of no trolls on the WoW forum are pointing to the AV beta and claiming "see? they are not zerging!"
---
Yeah its true. 
---
But its 2019 and there has to be some way to do it now. 
---
I was on burning blade and it was queues every evening almost. My guild eventually migrated to grim batol along with a bunch of others. 
---
But it was worth it compared to what WoW is today.
---
19 hunters dominate. 29 opens up many more classes, and really anything with BIS can be viable. 39 opens up every class essentially
---
surprised nobody mentioned rise against, silverstein, or dragonforce. those bands were everywhere in pvp videos back in the day.
---
Shamans and Hunters.
---
Druid. I played a resto since very early 2005 into naxx, when innervate was a talent or no invite, and feral and balance were absolute jokes. Ruined the class for me.
---
Thank you for at least admitting you are going against your own interests because REEE it must be like it was in vanilla.
---
2handers off rag will do more dps than pre bis gear so should go to fwar if they need it. I beleive this is true for every raid actually. After that I usually see them go to the main tank or anyone else that has put in a obvious investment into the guild. Be an active helpful member, hang out in discord and you will get one. Or just join a dkp guild and save it for 2h
---
It does annoy me a little that hunters don't get to spec for damage. Once you're in naxx level gear, you do significantly more DPS as survival due to the 15% extra agility talent, but... gotta have that trueshot aura. Feels bad man.
---
I played Warlock from vanilla - mop and only recently realized that the corruption icon is a guy puking out his insides.
---
No, but I want to be paying at least 20. Paying the original price is making me feel like I must be getting less than before.
---
World buffs isnt a requirement to raid, wdym? Nobody is forcing you to use them. Stop being stupid.
---
The thing is, it won’t take much to tip the scales. Classic will be “free” for people who already play bfa - no way with all the hype they don’t check it out. You only need a small portion of people who weren’t going to play classic to decide to play in order for everyone else to notice something is up. And from there more and more will move over - realizing the current game is a joke and their only hope for a fun time is to take the time machine ride back to 06 along with everyone else. Modern wow is toast, the people have spoken!! We want a decent game again!!
---
Did vanilla have millions of players at launch fighting to do the same quest? 
---
No. It didn’t. You didn’t have to wait in line to loot a rare mob. You didn’t have to fight to click on a NPC because people are stacked on them. Stop trying to get away from the vanilla experience.
---
Only if it's one of those neon mushroom ones from the early 2000s
---
?
---
Still not worse than layering
---
Sorry, but you cannot discount how having a few L60s in the raid zerg would make a WORLD of difference.
---
That was, honestly, one of the most intimidating videos I've ever seen.  I kind of want to re-create my experience playing vanilla WOW.  and I think to myself, "I'm so much better than I was back then."  The thing is, most everyone is so much better than they were back then.  Skillwise, it may not be much different than it was when I originally played -- maybe worse, hah.
---
Anyway, great video.  Thank you for linking it.  If you have any other really good vanilla PvP video recommendations, I'd appreciate it.
---
I would rather totem manage than paladin buff manage 40 people every 10 minutes.
---
The whole "first" mentality has ruined a lot of RPG games.
---
It's temporary and it's to make sure the servers aren't completely dead after a month after all the retail players who just wanted to try it out have left.
---
Robe of Power doesn’t have +Fire tho
---
Not at all
---
The one for Darkshore Groupers requires I think 6 fish. I definitely had the thought that, if I wasn't in such a big hurry to level ahead of the pack, I'd probably get to an appropriate level and camp out there to fish so that I could sell those fish for X silver for the exact amount you need for the quest. Lots and lots of people will want the quest XP but not want to spend the time to fish, after all.
---
Cause they’re human
---
They’re not just talking about the buffs from onyxia turn ins and such, they’re talking about buffs you can get in the world. Some of them last an hour.
---
Shaman wind fury much better then pally auto attack
---
OMG. So sorry this happened to you! Must be a bug because literally no one else has experienced this.
---
We actually saw rogue stealth depicted in one of their BFA cinematics, when they attack thrall, and rogue stealth is absolutely most def "magic" in nature.
---
Dead servers and forced server mergers are worse than virtual servers and natural collapse server mergers?
---
In TBC when people started stacking world buffs like the currently do for Vanilla, they removed world buffs from inside of raids because they became something that they were never intended to because they ran into the issue of world buffs being so overpowered to the point that they would either trivialize content or they would have to balance content around them so that the content was impossible without them. 
---
The only reason that they did not make this change in Vanilla was because it was not yet a wide scale problem in Vanilla.
---
Those voidwalker tanks tho
---
Rogues are top tier in every bracket
---
Int and spirit also make it so it takes longer before you have to eat and drink. Enjoy drinking after every two Pyroblasts. 
---
Also you shouldn’t be stacking stam, your objective as a mage is to not let shit get in melee range. If they are, you’re doing it wrong.
---
That with enchants, consumables, darkmoon fare trinkets, shadow oil and even possibly gear it was reported on pserves that spellpower rogues were doubling that of normal rogues. These were hardcore players too and they fixed it in the pserver. If this is true that's far more than 2% and they will fix it.
---
What level are these items available?
---
Main reason I was looking at skinning:
---
1) doesn't require nodes to farm;
---
2) speeds up spawns;
---
3) some Tailoring recipes require skinning materials;
---
4) selling mats to make money.
---
If not skinning, what would you recommend?
---
Are [Prayer of Healing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=596/prayer-of-healing) and [Holy Nova](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=132157/holy-nova) every used by healing priests during end-game raids?
---
Trying to decide if I should take the talents or not.
---
Comparing world buffs to consumables is disingenuous. Consumables could be acquired at any time, via multiple means, and didn't expire on death. World buffs need to be acquired right before raid and do expire on death. Now that I'm typing this, world buffs are reminding me of another horrible toxic mechanic that was the Immortal achievement in Naxx25 that Blizzard tried to rehash in awful ways that whole expansion. A single death or wipe ruining an entire week's worth of progression was NOT FUN and I say that even as one of those try-hards back then. Fuck that bull shit.
---
There’s no such thing as a Classic “purchase”. You just need an active subscription.
---
barely anyone had glaives back then in arena. I have seen maybe 3 different rogues on my realmpool back then and I played on the most deadly one in europe.
---
S5 was oneshot fest for the first half (Arcane + Retribution), after that most people loved it.
---
Short answer: yes. Long answer: yesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyes
---
You mean aspirations to play ranged character
---
That wouldn’t be cool at all. Why would I want to be around a bunch of WoW players?
---
That with enchants, consumables, darkmoon fare trinkets, shadow oil and even possibly gear it was reported on pserves that spellpower rogues were doubling that of normal rogues. These were hardcore players too and they fixed it in the pserver. If this is true that's far more than 2% and they will fix it in classic wow.
---
Not true, you get your highest water from a quest in diremaul which will create 10/cast at 60. This quest won't be avaliable in phase 1 so everyone will only get level 45 water which mages learn at level 50 (also 10/cast at level 60).
---
 Allow me introduce you to twink pvp
---
Less then that, 2 weeks
---
Who cares? Even if it’s a little bit worse than the shit you can buy, you’d have to be fucking crazy to waste money on drinks when you can make that shit for free.
---
You wont have to pre-purchase it as it is free (many already bought the original game) and you only have to have an active subscription to be able to play it.
---
It will most likely just show up in the launcher some time before the release so you can install it and then the servers themselves will go online on release day.
---
You'll be rare purely based of the fact that the human DPS boost for that free weapon skill is immense, especially with info we now know about the it's DPS contribution.
---
Oh, okay. I thought the dps was too low on alliance side. Yeah, there will definitely be a lot of fury wars and rogues. Dark edge of insanity and asskandi here I come.
---
Metroid is the scientist, you’re thinking of Metroid’s Monster
---
how many more to trigger your autism?
---
You're right, they'll be more useful because they reflect demand of modern vanilla players more accurately
---
EPGP with your own specific changes to suit you. Other than loot council (which you could mix in) it's generally the best way and most versatile for each guild.
---
Even with Frostbolt most mobs already go down in a couple of shots
---
Second this except one tweak I would make is the hunter range/clipping from cata. I used to main shaman and I can't tell you how many hunters I've  /taunt /wave /spit /lol /bye to while sitting in their dead zone slowly killing them because my frost root could hold them in limbo until they died.
---
People forget that the try hards in this sub will only make up a fraction of the players on the game once it comes out. You’ll still see your noobs running around and people who just want to have fun without worrying about min/maxing
---
Healers mana bar IS tanks health bar.
---
Loved fighting Horrigan and his Enclave those first months on Bleeding Hollow.  Before we moved to Cho'gall, which coincidentally they opened transfers from BH to Cho'gall around AQ40 or Naxx release and got to see all my old friends again.
---
Yup been playing pservers. Saves me $15 month for chance at beta. Will resub on release.
---
I don't think tailoring is that bad. Enchanting can be rough to level but I think the key issue with it is that you have to have a lot of the recipes to make money on it (connections can be important), and if you're too far behind the initial surge of players who get those recipes, your services will not be prioritized. People just like going to one person who has everything, after all.
---
But neither is 'fatally' slow to level. I think enchanting is fun but I liked getting high leveled and steamrolling lowbie dungeons for cloth/greens to DE.
---
Prayer of healing was awesome for fights like Vael in BWL, being able to spam (with pretty much unlimited mana) keeps your group alive. Helpful until everyone is a bit more geared!
---
What wpvp are you expecting to see in starting zones?
---
&gt;Private server culture, on the other hand, may mandate world buffs. But I don't give two shits about private server culture.
---
Trust me. You will feel different when your guild spends 3 full raid nights wiping their way through AQ40 and Naxx every week and you spend hundreds of gold on consumables instead of just getting World buffs and breezing through the raids in a single evening.
---
You’ll see it at the Auction House and in the realm Discord, because that’s exactly what Blizzard plans.
---
Yeah.. but tbh it’s a far better system. MoP Hunter was the best iteration of the class by a mile imo. SV hunter in WoD was incredibly fun in PvP. Then something went wrong with MM and BM. I like the new melee SV, but I think I’d trade it for WoD’s version.
---
Instead of the content having a n actual difficulty curve, they shoehorned a difficulty slider in.
---
So turn them into group auras? 
---
Personally, as a Paladin main, I feel blessings are in this weird place where they are strong enough that you can't ignore them, but they expire so quickly that you can't just set and forget.
---
Of the two 'Bard' classes, I always thought shorter term but stronger buffs were the better idea. Although I haven't had to drop totems every pull, so I can't really be objective.
---
*cries in healer*
---
I wouldn’t skip Fire Ward I think. Many caster mobs throw fireballs and that shit is very useful on them.
---
Closest thing is an interview with Ion where he says they are open to idea of it as a tool to balance server population. 
---
That pretty much guarantees it will be a thing since it’s free money.
---
How does it work? I remember WOTLK having a PVP stat that Classic doesnt have (I believe) and it had two separate BiS sets that you could buy with Arena points or by doing ICC, is the gear that you get from BGs the best for PVP?
---
Wrong, they reflect the economy of a server that got a shit ton of things wrong and purposefully fucked the economy by changing node respawns and other things.
---
Hey everyone. I haven't played since Wrath, but I can't wait to get into classic. Is it worth playing retail until classic releases? I have a level 80 character, so I'd have plenty of content to work through.
---
In pugs I guess, but in organized pvp they are not. Very CD reliant and can be peeled off pretty easily after they open up.
---
Holy Nova is very good for farming low-level dungeons.
---
A bit of a queue? You'd have to start your login queue before bed so you could hopefully play when you wake up. And idk where you get the idea that wpvp is dead?
---
Yeah layering is worse than merging with a server with 2000 fourteen year olds or asmongold.
---
Atleast its the same 2000 fourteen year olds, and not just completely random players every day.
---
I still remember when battlegrounds became cross realm in late vanilla. It was super dissapointing to me. 
---
Yeah the queues became a lot shorter, but now you were just fighting randoms.
---
It was great fun fighting people you recognized.
---
Holy paladin got to be in with a shout?
---
&gt;Now replace “exploit” above with world buffs.
---
I think not being able to fly is an explot as it allows guilds you block off areas of the map. This tankfully got fixed in TBC so Vanilla should have flying too.
---
See where I am going with this? Calling something an exploit does not make it an exploit. It's just how the game worked.
---
&gt;Why are some people dead set on playing shit like ret
---
Cause ret can have some incredible, top tier DPS when played with more than half a brain.
---
Go ahead and use remindme bot. There's been a ton of theorycrafting in the past year. Ret is capable of top segment of Recount.
---
On the beta there is layering in arathi and STV
---
For a Hunter Pet in a DPS setting, is it worth it to train both Bite and Claw, or to only get Claw and spend the TP somewhere other than Bite?
---
Again, there are already tauren npcs in the game that stealth.
---
Have been wondering this as well. Rolled a toon on a private server to practise a bit myself
---
If the world buff meta is anything like some anecdotes I have read, or like the video you reference, then they are complete cancer.
---
The argument behind keeping them is "play your way (get them or dont)" which, again, if its anything like the video you reference, is asking for classic to be a terrible experience. If a very small minority of players get them and they have relatively no impact, I no longer care. However, and this is based on posts like this, I imagine the private server community driving these as required as going to be very real. 
---
A fallacious and far less solid argument behind them is "they were there in vanilla, therefor they must be there in classic." I get the no change crowed, and for the most part, I even agree with the concept. However, there is *reasoning* that backs the concept of #nochanges. The reason for changes is to try and replicate the experience people had in vanilla wow as best you could. You can't be a part of your community when you are logged out preserving the timer on your raidrequired world buff. People keep flailing their arms against this by just repeating no changes, but I have not seen anyone defend that keeping world buffs as-is is actually going to be subverting the vanilla experience. 
---
People mindlessly saying no changes are just shitposting.
---
Find an ornithology group which maybe car pools to get a bit into the more greener suburbs or watches the local birds. 
---
Or a chess group which assembles with protable chairs in the local park.
---
Or maybe there is group doing various activities like collecting garbage one weekend (like these city cleanup pictures on reddit sometimes), paints a daycare nonprofit next week, or do local shelter work. 
---
there really is a lot you can do if you are open for new activities :)
---
Missed MoP out in that list so we are season 8.
---
&gt;while at the same time costing us time.
---
Yes, spending an hour getting world buffs so you can clear all the raids in one evening instead of having multiple raid nights really cost a lot of time.
---
Hurr Durr.
---
Yes they will, you are vastly underestimating the power of world buffs if you believe otherwise. 
---
World buffs are the difference between a 3 hour MC and a 1-2 hour MC for a casual guild. You don't have to be speed running world first to see the benefit in something where all you have to do to get them is be standing in a city or interact with something.
---
This is really, really awesome. Great work dude.
---
Just run out of aggro range and let them die. Then drink over their corpse and rez the tank last.
---
Every now and then if there was a lull before a boss pull we might summon a doomguard, but it was pretty much just for the fun of laughing over who died.
---
It might have technically been a DPS improvement (no clue if anyone crunched the numbers) but even if it was, for a progression raid boss it wasn't worth the added chaos, and on non-progression/speed running fights the delay to summon was longer than any (potential) dps gain merited.
---
Everyone is entitled to play the game how they want though. If they want to rush through certain aspects of the game that is their prerogative. Its no different than people who want to focus on pvp vs people who want to focus on raiding. Everyone has different goals, some people enjoy the leveling experience others just want to get to the end game. I don't want to shit on people who want to rush through leveling because I was in the top raiding guild on my server in WOTLK and Cata. It feels good getting server first kills, there is a sense of pride, so I understand the mentality. Difference is in my opinion, the leveling experience in WOTLK and Cata was boring at best. Vanilla the leveling experience is more interesting because it actually feels like you're building a character.
---
I mean Alliance has that with DM, Stocks, BFD and Gnomer.
---
&gt;Not necessarily. The threat cap in vanilla will be much lower than what people are used to on private servers so buffing yourself to the teeth will just cause you to steal aggro if you use any of your abilities.
---
9% more Parry while mobs also do less damage so you can afford to wear more threat gear.
---
Ye... much lower. Some people arent very intelligent lol
---
I don't see wolves.
---
No it’s basically everyone. I have it, my guild has it and people have been posting about it.
---
Orc Warlock.
---
everyone else is, so why not
---
Ive seen it on youtube where alliance went to face horde in arathi. 
---
Guess what?
---
They couldnt see eachother
---
And classic will have a completely fucked economy vs 2006 vanilla because layering will mean the supply side is completely different while the demand will be completely different due to foreknowledge of what items gain value in future content as well as just generally increased game knowledge adding value to certain items.
---
I remember selling one for 1500 late in vanilla. Was nice.
---
Warlock hit ratings. I’ve heard Warlocks really start to shine when they get late stage gear that gives then hit rating bonuses. Before having that gear, do Warlocks have a tough time hitting their target because of a lack of hit rating talents (besides the one talent in I believe the affliction tree)?
---
Maybe I’m wrong but I’ve always seen it as they use icons that help give off the intended feeling from the spell, rather then finding the most literal depiction. This becomes especially apparent if you’ve ever messed around with using different icons via macros and it completely changes the feel of the spell.
---
I'm not saying bad. What I'm saying is the mentality has manifest into a stigma that needs to be followed for most, even if they don't want to because of outside pressures and access to certain events. It has quite literally changed the gaming scene mentality.
---
Druids, hunters and locks shred mages tho.
---
FACEPALM
---
i played the tail end of MoP before WOD so that epxlains it.
---
lol. no. i dont want to drag myself to a store to get a physical copy in todays age of technical wonder. i mean, sure, there's many downsides to the current state of the internet, but the ability to download whatever i want, whenever i want, aint one of them.
---
Ah, I dropped my mage by that point I think for warrior so don't really remember. Also my memory is awful.
---
Didn’t Shamans have a dual-wielding talent in enhancement?
---
Does minor movement speed stack with the druid cat form movement speed talent? I'm thinking no, but the talent doesn't specify like the paladin talent does.
---
Oh yes it will be perfect on the 27th of August.
---
I might not be alone but it will just be random players out of a shifting 20k pool. Might aswell be alone.
---
Congratulations! You’re the 100th poster to repost this!
---
and steal all the 2handers, and one handers and ... basically everything.
---
Dwarf shadow priest
---
Deadmines vancleef and mr.smite ?
---
You don't need world buffs to clear them in one evening if you know what you are doing. .
---
Mages. I’ve never liked them.
---
That is so awesome. I'm glad you were able to make it work. I will make an update to the the original post with your link.
---
Of course I don't. I was like 14 at the time.
---
Layering will be in the game for 2 months, that's hardly a lasting impact on the economy.
---
And you're precisely right on the knowledge part, which is why my Auctioneer data is more useful than your Pserver data.
---
I convinced my friend group to roll horde on the off-chance that someone wants to heal as a shaman and I get some sweet sweet totem love.
---
&gt; Atleast its the same 2000 fourteen year olds, and not just completely random players every day.
---
You don't seem to have a firm grasp on what Layering is...
---
19 and 39 is my favorite bracket. 
---
19 rogue or hunter 
---
39 priest or mage.
---
/r/woooosh
---
&gt;I love vanilla and will play it. I could live without world buffs, I could live without debuff limit. I think both would make the game more interesting and fun if they were removed, without making it easier.
---
Wrong though.
---
You havent played Vanilla until you know the thrill of having a fully world buffed raid trying to get through Blackrock Mountain while fighting a full 40 man raid trying to kill you to make you lose world buffs.
---
It adds a whole new layer to the player driven gameplay of Vanilla. Without world buffs it would remove this aspect of the game which a lot of players enjoy. 
---
The argument of those in favor of removing world buffs can be summarized as this:
---
"I am too lazy to get world buffs so I will rather see them removed from the game because I dont respect other people who get enjoyment out of them and I put my own selfish needs to be a lazy sloth first"
---
My favorite thing to do is as a Gnome Warlock, drink Noggenfogger till I’m super tiny and hide inside my Voidwalker. It’s absolutely hilarious when a rogue is looking for me and can’t find me then I DoT him to oblivion when they walk past me.
---
Herbing + skinning, loot everything, vendor everything, don’t buy anything. It’s really not that hard
---
Lol got it. Fast travel is bad in RPGs but only in games we wanna criticisze.
---
Any shred of proof?
---
reesports
---
Well yes, since it invalidates DW tanking completely which was necessary to keep up with fury warriors.
---
So dont use them? Whats the problem lol.
---
Sounds to me like you want to join a top tier guild that easily clear raids, but you dont want to put in the effort required to be in such a guild.
---
Explain to me how not wanting to be forced to logoff to preserve a buff is casual. Playing less is casual, forcing me to logoff and do something else so that I can be buffed at raid is casual. Your argument, as bad as it is, defeats itself.
---
If this was just running a quick DM tribute run I wouldn't have any issues.
---
Yeah its to increase the server population to like 15-20k and divide them into layers of 3-5 k a pop.
---
Feral does still have some snapshot mechanics with Tiger's Fury and Bloodtalons. As much as I hated snapshotting it in the past, its been kind of nice to play feral over balance while im bored during during this content lull just because it still has some depth to it still (albeit not much).
---
Druids &amp; Paladins 
---
I just cant play!
---
Ah yes, xXxLegolasxXx, the Night Elf with a Boar pet.
---
I know that in the end I’ll be a support class. 
---
Since I can’t benefit from tier sets I barely need any items and hope to save my dkp for the HoR ;)
---
This is cool info! Yeah, I'm 100% in in Tailoring at this point.
---
It seems with Classic a lot of previous ideas are going out the window, haha.
---
Don’t be an idiot.
---
Maybe Blizzard should limit the download speed of the client from Battle.NET to 861 kbps like the good ol' days. Then you'd for sure want to run to Walmart and grab a set of disks.
---
Unless you really neglected on gear you shouldn’t be oom after 3 spells. Also evoc and free drinks. Also if mage is getting hit then tank is not doing his job right
---
I used to think a lot when you could use heirlooms and play at the 10-14 bracket. Hunters and rogues were sick!! Just soooo OP! 
---
If I get my main suitably geared (resto shammy) and I then get my farming hunter to 60, my next plan is a twink at level 19. Prob hunter or rogue. 
---
Plan would be to get a 2nd sub....then run them through Deadmines and WC for the BiS gear. 
---
Not even sure if you can transfer the char from account to account anymore, even if the same name, but would try.
---
Lol the amount of players that are going to login day 1 of Classic **monumentally dwarfs** the amount of players that played day 1 of Vanilla.
---
Layering is **necessary**.
---
Needs more 60 for more gear variation and epic mounts. Also marks of honor, because there is no incentive to defense stall a losing game. After people start rep grinding and their time has more value for other aspects of the game, they'll get over the, "we're gonna fight until the bitter end". Seeing people fishing in the ponds will crush your will.
---
Exactly how the original release of it went over time
---
What’s seal twisting?
---
BFA is not classic, all concept of class fantasy has been long abandoned in retail WoW.
---
There were also "caster pets," which just basically had worse stats
---
And I'd argue that's bad design.
---
It's not about me.
---
If we start changing things because some people don't like them we will end up with a completely different game.
---
There is no way to have the exact same experience as it was in Vanilla you can't just delete people's knowledge of the game, the meta will be vastly different. The average player today will utilize consumables a lot more than they did back in Vanilla. I was tryharding with consumes even back in Vanilla but my guild never really required anyone to do it until the later bosses in AQ and in Naxx.
---
I'm going to assume that in todays meta even some casual guilds will have a sort of "requirement" to use consumables, of course not to the extent that we see on pservers since they have increased spawn rates.
---
How would even Blizzard decide which changes they add? Should we consider things like, 1.12 talents and debuff slots make MC much easier than they were originally? It's much cleaner and easier to keep the no changes philosphy. 
---
Obviously the exception to this are things that are game breaking exploits.
---
This is hilarious. Guess since Name plates not viable at all..
---
I mained hunter up until now and I don't want to do the same thing so I'm rolling a different class. Having a simple 19 twink would be perfect tho! 
---
How long would you say it takes to gear a 19 hunter twink?
---
A ton of streamers didnt think they would be all that into it but now it's all they want to play and they go on and on about how trash retail is
---
I totally agree.  I’m not against layering at all and think it’s completely necessary.  But taking a stance that it’s vanilla like is utter BS.
---
It's not casual, because you have alts. And any guild doing speedruns (the only time world buffs matter), are going to control when they get them. They won't have to logoff for very long, if at all.
---
Priest? I'm definitely curious - what's the playstyle?
---
Not after 1.9, no.
---
You’re not going to be wearing this tho. You’re going to be wearing a pink dress and healing and buffing the raid.
---
I don't entirely understand this subreddits recent obsession with world buffs but they are not private server world buffs, you will rarely (never) have all of them up. I don't get why you're saying they're exploitable because they're not.
---
Even if they are or were... so what? If a poopsocker puts in far more effort than everyone else then he should be properly ahead of everyone else.
---
Welcome to real vanilla.
---
What you described is the reality for average or bad players. So for you, I guess it's not different at all.
---
They already sais that character creation will be a few weeks before release. I guess thats when it will show up on all accounts. 
---
You wont be able to login past character creation as worldserver will be down.
---
Rogue. I love leveling as feral Druid but for some reason, the class that is most similar is somehow my least favorite. Also Warlock.
---
Those are literally the options
---
Technically an exploit how...? Using ride wide buffs to gain a raid wide advantage in raids seems pretty reasonable to me. Also:
---
&gt; Stop arguing slippery slope.
---
&gt; Stacking world buffs and the toxicity of Pservers where everything revolves around that is going to make classic worse.
---
See how easy it is to call literally any inductive argument that moves from specific observations to general conclusions a slippery slope? I can do it too.
---
Afaik no, but it does increase your movespeed inside when the cat form talent isn't active.
---
Why is it any more unrealistic than a personified garden ornament shooting fire from his fingertips?
---
It's going to surround you with the amount of players that you would've seen on Vanilla. The alternative would be to make 500 different servers, which would be a disaster from top to bottom.
---
It’s ok. Alliance is beta anyways
---
Hey don't sweat it — as the disclaimer at the start of the video said it's all played on an invite-only server with infinite consumables and instant 60 + free gear. That's the cream of the crop duking it out in really unrealistic scenarios with maximum tryharding. Classic will be nowhere near that level of play.
---
Here's a good hunter one:
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7B24r8J6ZZs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7B24r8J6ZZs)
---
By the time you hit 60 totems are no issue , but rebuffing 40 ppl every 9 minutes is annoying
---
The icon for Blink is of a dwarf.  After WoW Alpha dwarves could no longer be mages.
---
Because being on a dead realm untill blizz decides it's time to merge is gonna be so much fun.
---
After waiting for over 10 years to play the game that few months when you actually can play will be just fine even with layering.
---
I'm fine with that. If ret can do decent dps in the 1.12 state thats awesome. I just don't want to see ret players complaining and advocating for buffs once the game is out.
---
&gt; All you are is a set of melee attacks
---
What isn't fun about bashing your enemies heads in with giant weapons? And wearing massively oversized armor allowing you to take hits from anything and still stand strong. A big part of the class identity of warriors is their weapons and armor. For most classes equipment is just an assortment of magical items making you passively more powerful, warriors actually use their equipment as an integral part in their combat. 
---
It's not strictly just melee attacks either. You have shouts too, buffing/debuffing enemies, causing them to flee, etc. And you can somehow conjure lightning with a clap of your weapon (I have no idea how thunderclap works). Taunt is, well, a taunt, basically insulting your enemy or whatever to get them to attack you, kind of funny. Charge and intercept are fun movement abilities too. A shame heroic leap wasn't a thing until much later, probably my favorite warrior ability.
---
Just merge earlier. Better than layering
---
Roll shadow and melt faces in pvp
---
Don’t change the game at all, but change the thing that makes you stronger for raids because muh fun!!!
---
Simple answer: PvE gear can prioritize stats that are useless in PvP (such as hit chance), and converse is true for PvP gear in PvE (STA is wasted for most classes).
---
Actual class-by-class or spec-by-spec BIS reasoning is probably beyond the scope of this sticky.
---
isnt every server lopsided nowadays?
---
I was not aware of this, i supose ill just log in to my private server
---
As a warrior, hunters were always a pain in the ass
---
I remember taking songflower in retail vanilla to raid Naxx, but we never bothered with onyxia/nef head. Maybe was it because you couldn't get the buff if the head was already there?
---
&gt; WOW doesn't start until you hit 60, really.
---
Different opinions.
---
World buffs in raids were in Classic, therefore they should not be removed.
---
If that annoys people, then Classic is not the game for them.
---
&gt;  But if you were battling for rank1 and facing that team over and over again, I get it could be frustrating.
---
S2/S3 gladiator in 3s, I was sitting on the border of duelist/gladiator S4. Trying to make the push for gladiator, you see a lot of the same teams (especially back then when Blizzard was running 2s, 3s, and 5s simultaneously). We just settled for duelist because the meta was not favorable and we had no interest in re-rolling that late in the expansion to adapt to the meta. Tried again in S5, that was basically the end of that, back-to-back unfun season. 
---
I really have no interest in arguing with random people online about it beyond that, I experienced it, it was bad.
---
No, just no. Classic needs to stay classic.
---
This is going to vary a lot depending on who you're asking.
---
In my humble opinion, no. Personally I'd rather save that hype for a couple of more months.
---
Current retail feels very different to the Wotlk you know. Not necessarily a bad thing, you might enjoy it a lot.
---
While this seems good, it also seems like a major pain for everybody involved - the spreadsheets are huge. Also - I understand that you can't change the values, but how can I assign values to all pieces if I am pre-raid bis? I do not know what I will need the most in 6 weeks... This goes triple time for non-released raids (but I guess you could update the sheet once new tier releases).
---
Also, what do you mean by this: ?
---
&gt; handing out loot takes no more than a minute at the end of a raid.
---
At the end of the RAID?
---
I see. Well, I guess its PvP only then. I don't really enjoy many of the other classes this time around for some reason.
---
It would be 6 per craft. At lvl 58 it would be 2, 4 at lvl 59, 6 at 60.
---
Great. So you'll be stickied to a layer, and play with the same 3-5,000 players... just like a dedicated server.
---
"You wouldn't understand it"
---
Easy way out, just try me.
---
I'm not playing human warrior. But I don't mind humans as a race. If you think you need to be some weird magical creature to be immersed in a fantasy setting you lack imagination.
---
&gt; If we start changing things because some people don't like them we will end up with a completely different game.
---
I stopped reading here. Stop using the slippery slope argument. I am not asking for sweeping changes, and if you believe making one change will lead to a million changes then thats your own paranoia talking. 
---
I want one change that, if the youtube video is anywhere near correct on, will stop a asston of toxic gameplay where I am forced to logout to preserve a buff for raid. "Don't do it if you dont want to" is very well addressed in the video.
---
I have no issues putting in the time to get bis before a raid. I have no issues putting in time to get gold for repairs. I have no issues putting in time for all of the consumables that you can stack (pots and demonic runes). However, if the video is anywhere near accurate, and I will be required to get timered buffs (which will almost certainly require you to logout to preserve them), I now have a problem. Stop asking me to logout as a design mechanic. Its bad and it needs to go, regardless of whether it was "technically" possible in vanilla or not.
---
If you think this is prone to sweeping changes in other areas, thats on you. I am not aware of any other mechanics where I am forced to logout to optimize gameplay. 
---
Its like if the 1-60 speedrun community only killed monsters while they had rested experience, meaning the majority of their time was spent logged out. They don't do this because its fucking dumb.
---
Cap was raised to 40 recently, and it's actually been decently fun. Besides I get to test my leveling routes so I don't get trapped trying to complete quests with everyone else on launch day.
---
We don't need much. we're in a good place.
---
Bad rets (those who wear warrior gear) might still complain tho.
---
Good point
---
How is your community constantly getting dissolved any better than layering?
---
What ever happened to 3 doors down anyways.
---
No because I have the CE! Downvote away baby!
---
Certainly not in my experience
---
Not at all. That socialization is about forming groups to get group content done. Not to collect bear asses.
---
Stance dancing is pretty fun tho, its probably funnier to play Warrior in tbc with the fancy spell reflect
---
Does Power Word: Shield get any benefit from +Healing items?
---
No, you can get pushed out of a layer if its capped. Like while joining a group or leaving one..
---
That's the point of beta, and people reporting these issues in game is our way of letting blizzard know. I'm simply stating that the way this post is worded makes OP seem like the typical entitled classic wow enthusiast, like blizzard owes him an explanation as to why the game isnt in perfect working order during a beta. Its kinda funny if you think about it.
---
Interesting! It might not have the most APM, but its role is to do mediocre damage while supporting your group with instants &amp; auras, the former you can weave within auto attacks. Personally I find that very interesting gameplay. Also, I find Paladins have the most interesting lore driven mechanics, along with Warlocks and Druids. Finally there is the flexibility to switch between heal/DPS whenever I want. What do you think about those aspects? Genuinely curious what makes somebody think the complete opposite of what I do :)
---
per https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/95abc8/list_of_spellcoefficients_1121/,
---
20% spellpower and 29% holy spellpower.
---
What was the cool down?
---
You can farm herbs
---
I'm not arguing it's unrealistic. A game, a movie or a TV-show doesn't have to be realistic to be good. It does however have to adhere to it's own rules. There is a reason why every race can not be every class, it's not just a random decision the class designers made. 
---
Send Kevin Jordan an e-mail if it's that difficult to comprehend.
---
What if I told you Fury Tanks with world buffs are are a better MT than Prot?
---
Yes but if I’m not mistaken the coefficient is only 5% or 0.05 meaning every +100 healing is only adding 5 to the tooltip.
---
Which part of "i don't have time to educate you" was too difficult for you to understand? I don't need easy way out, i believe you need some kind of way to start educating yourself.
---
"You have alts." Literally defending a mechanic that forces you to logout because you would rather do that than admit you are wrong. 
---
The way you turn-in things like Onys head is different from how it works on Pservers. You know this right? The only way top guilds can account for this is to shift raid times around 2-12 hours.
---
Wait....
---
You want to skip QoL Small changes and skip right to changing the entire game entirely?
---
Do you recall the big city community if classic wow?  No one will be there if they have to grow their crops to min/max the game bud
---
I’m wondering if Swiftmend is necessary once a resto druid has enough gear (for PvE that is). It’s a good talent, but the points could go elsewhere, the way I see it.
---
Paladin, vanilla paladin is the most boring class I've ever played in WoW. 
---
Rogue, I don't like energy as a resource. 
---
Hunter, I don't like pets or pet management. 
---
Warlock, pets again, and why would I not just play mage instead?
---
Druid, I don't like shapeshifting.
---
The ideas are getting more weird by the day, already curious where we get by August.
---
Good points, thanks for the write-up.
---
You could apply this to literally any well meaning change in TBC, Wrath, ect. It's not like the designers were trying to make the game shit, they honestly thought they were improving on the balance and oversights of vanilla/previous versions of the game. If you start trying to "balance" vanilla, you no longer have vanilla. We know what TBC is, and we don't want TBC. 
---
^((I actually want do TBC, but not in my classic)^)
---
You make 2 lists, one for MC+BWL and one for everything else.
---
You base your list off of your own personal research. Only you know what you need/want most.
---
WoW Classic has loot trading in raids. One person can collect all the loot and give it out at the end of the raid (or within 2 hours).
---
That's not how it works. When you log in to the game you will be assigned a layer. The only reason you will shift to another one or see people disappear or appear out of nowhere is if they join a group where the party leader is not on the same layer as them. This will be nothing like sharding. You will only ever play with people on your server.
---
So is the video exaggerating the impacts of world buffs in raids?
---
Apart from #nochange, player housing is a bad idea : like garrisons it drains players from the world making it feeling empty.
---
Whatever new activities would you create, they should happen in the world so that players can interact with each other.
---
“Lol dude. I can’t tank for this fucking group if I am not going to get heals” leaves group jumps around and is teleported to ogrimmar
---
Caster stat pets were in the game all the way to the end of TBC. I'm pretty sure they were considered a bug, though, so I don't know if they'll be in Classic.
---
You're redirecting your embarrassment for not knowing something that is easy to find out.
---
Without a doubt
---
I don't remember him specifically talking about himself getting camped. He talked about stream sniping in general. Even if he was killed once a day by the same person, every day, that he is what he was talking about. Not repeatedly killing him over and over.
---
So technically, this is exactly what these guys are doing.
---
I'm not personally against this either, I find the Ooga gang hilarious. I'm saying that Sodapoppin said he was against this exact thing, so I wonder what he thinks about this now that horde players are doing it.
---
If you think that a smallish beta is going to be anything like day one live, yikes.
---
And great work on the app, from which I reverse engineered your encoding and ripped your data so I could link it to the correct positions in game
---
Is launch phase 1 or phase 0?
---
&gt; but I'm worried they'll try to remove this secretly.
---
Probably an unreasonable fear. It was an intended feature added in 1.1, buffed several times through 1.12. Wasn't removed until Cata.
---
BFA doesn't serve as a capstone of WOW and make everything that came before worse
---
Yet, you have time to write nonsensical arguments and insults.
---
If you truly believed what you were saying you would actually try to convince me using actual arguments instead of just insulting me
---
Watch the beta
---
All cities had auction houses, they just weren't connected. You could list something in Thunder Bluff from the beginning.
---
I remember a guild leader of mine on a pserver who was a ret pally use Bonereavers Edge...was weird?
---
Just wand whatever it is they pulled and if they ask why the fuck you aren't healing them, just respond saying you don't have enough Mana to do anything other than just wanding.
---
Rogue - they are pretty pvp on ez mode. Also most rogues ive meet remind me of a leathery version of huntard.
---
I guess I just never understood the appeal of speed running for competition. I've run MC probably close to 100 times over the years of vanilla and pservers, but I've never felt the need to speed run. If I was looking for a 'challenge' I would rather complete the content with off specs and alts.
---
Rogues. I like the general idea of sneaking around, yet it actually isn't fun for me. Played all classes to Level 100 at least, but I never managed to play a Rogue for more than 20 levels.
---
Just claw, spend the rest elsewhere.
---
I have and it doesn't refute the point of how it works. Maybe you need to read up on how it works.
---
This is it. The lesser of all the evils. Anything you do sucks. Layering is just gonna suck less.
---
I'm not embarrassed lmao. But I find it funny how some people think it's not okay for me to ask a question about a game on the subreddit for that game.
---
End game was ok but the journey of leveling and going to unexplored areas that i have never been was what i had the best memories of
---
This is exactly it. My big take away is that they expect a lot of lightning related issues and most of them will need to be fine tuned with manual corrections.
---
Then I wonder what the DPS difference is in terms of leveling. I do know I love Wind Serpents for PVP when hitting anything above leather.
---
farming was the best part of MoP
---
By having bought retail you already bought the vanilla game.
---
No they didn't.
---
In vanilla you started with the quest item in your inventory, this was changed during TBC so that you received it in the mail instead, people who already did the former ended up with 2 pets but never a 3rd untill they made pets account wide.
---
At max level, there are 11 servers within 10% A/H deviation, another 12 servers within 20%, and another 32 servers within 30%. There are 58 servers with a swing greater than 2:1.
---
It's a problem for warlocks , but you can get a few off set peices before zg bloodvine to help out.
---
Happy to see the originator approves the work as well :) Great community of developers.
---
Ooooh you missed the constant "DAE think this is garbage" circlejerk
---
Disturbed, breaking Benjamin, rise against, atreyu, and others I don't remember
---
&gt; But its 2019 and there has to be some way to do it now.
---
Like dividing a server into different parts and later merge them when the population drops.
---
MoP is utter garbage so you didn't miss anything.
---
You say this, but you clearly don't remember. I do remember, but not well, so I went looking. All the news articles for Patch 1.9 talk about Auction Houses being *added* to the other 2 cities for each faction and there isn't a single source that says same-faction cities had different auction houses.
---
inferior? are our fore fathers inferior because what they did is old and outdated? you're just rude dude. seems to me the only thing you can actually see is your own perceptive.
---
*Laughs in illumination*
---
That's probably a mistake unless you plan on gold farming days on end. By the time you're ready to drop skinning you'll be spending huge amounts of gold for the mats. Also not to mention you'll need to buy mats for enchanting as well.
---
They have never merged servers in WoW. 
---
Even in vanilla with a steady pop increase they had dead servers prior to 6 months into the games life.
---
Leaving server economies and communities in tact (even though you will “hardly” see the same players the first few months) is better than forcing merges which destroys and fractures both communities and economies.
---
So people complain when they rip off Pokemon for Pet battles
---
Then suggest they want to rip off Farm Simulator!?
---
*counts coin in mage*
---
Dwarf is the best player killing race for the Alliance, good luck keeping up with your worst race.
---
&gt; just stay logged out until the raid starts.
---
This is awful game design though. Playing optimally shouldn't involve not playing.
---
How could they realize that before S8 GOT existed?
---
Ah fuck I got got
---
I still wouldn't argue that forcing yourself *not* to play the game so you can have the best advantage where it counts is somehow "casual".
---
And yes, I'm aware of the timers for world buffs in Vanilla.
---
They did player housing called garrissons it was awful. Also it included the option of a farm.
---
Retail WoW doesn't begin until you hit max level.
---
Classic WoW is a journey the whole way through at any level.
---
Player housing in stormwind is nothing like garrisons. The housing plots would all be in the same instance so you can visit other player's houses. There can be farms in the open world as well.
---
Just reroll on a populated server then. 
---
Hardcore
---
No thanks. 
---
I hate when rpg games make me build houses and plant crops. 
---
Perfect example is fallout 4. I legit had to build a house to continue the story.
---
I stopped playing fallout 4 when I reached that quest.
---
As close as possible to 2006. They also stated they would like to avoid the launch mess they had in 2004. Layering is how they are deciding to avoid that mess.
---
Or, "I want to play my character and not keep it logged out because I happened to have a nice buff at the dmf." the wpvp thing is true, but there will still be some at raid time, wbuff or not.
---
Whatever it takes 😃
---
Paladin is best at ganking, coming from a rogue player. You can initiate any fight you want and if it doesn't go you're way, bubble-hearth.
---
The level 30 cap was a unique and strange beast of a meta. It was really fun.
---
Level 40 is an equally unique and strange meta.
---
In classic, I had an auto-it script that watched for the buttons to press and I would sit on the IF bridge conjuring lvl 60 mage water and selling it for tips while I was at work.  I got my first and second epic mounts that way.
---
Yup, the journey to 60 is a good, fun chunk of the vanilla experience to me
---
Every single time a "new" mmo comes out, there are always a tiny, insignificant amount of idiots trying to promote awful playstyles and makes excuses about how it can totally work if "X, Y ,Z."
---
There even was a moron last night, on this board, saying how prot pally totally can work and all that it would require would be for the guild to adopt and put in more effort and... blah blah blah. What kind of a selfish piece of garbage do you have to be to join/make a guild just so people have to put in an extra effort just because you want to feel special?
---
No thanks.
---
Isn’t fear ward 3 min cooldown? Can you really give it to someone every 30 seconds??
---
100% holy shit
---
Don't be a retard.
---
Yeah its going to be a pass from me i guess.
---
1.12 also means cross realm PVP
---
It has no bearing on the discussion. You'll understand. See you around (or most likely not).
---
The community will be to big to have the houses all in the same instance
---
Well if layering works like their retail sharding and you add that dude to your friends list.. pretty good. Even if it doesn’t it’s a higher chance than running into the same person on retail with sharding and CRZ. As they are on the same realm and the pool in quite finite compared to the pool in modern WoW.
---
What the fuck is this
---
&gt; didn't expire on death
---
Yes they do. The only thing that persists are the 100g+ flasks. And not all of the world buffs expire on death (ZG one for instance).
---
The math says no, not sure why you are randomly shitposting this?
---
You don't grind honor like a currency in Classic.
---
You grind Ranks and you wouldn't get a high enough Rank at 49 to hit 60 and buy the armor sets.
---
Sets are bought with Gold so you'd also have to grind that up AFTER tour Epic mount.
---
I never managed to get past level 20 with Druid, Shaman and Paladin. Maybe that's not enough to out right refuse to try again, but i doubt i will give either of them a new chance any time soon.
---
It is more vanilla like than the alternatives though especially the ones that involve not having it and just having 20k servers.
---
No one is fucking forcing you to do anything. Holy shit. Being incentivized to log off IF you want to go full try hard and keep those buffs, is not being forced. 
---
That’s like saying “Well if to want to go full try hard and reach rank 14 I’m FORCED to play 16 hours a day for months at a time.” 
---
It’s s fucking choice. Don’t want to? Then don’t.
---
The wrong sub
---
Vanilla tryhards: "Stop wasting everyone's time! In and out, 20 minute raid!"
---
Also vanilla tryhards: "Everyone needs to farm for 5 hours a day so that we can have a 20 minute raid."
---
I played hardcore from classic through mop. Removal of dotsnapshotting and implementation of garrisons killed it for me.
---
I played for first page wowprogress for years. I spent more time sitting through raid logs than I did playing the game.
---
Then WoD, and I was gone.
---
I think the old screen shots of the day were made for players. I noticed a lot of them had peoples characters in the pics and less of environment envy. 
---
Funny poses in awkard locations and stuff like that. I like your screen though its comfortably ominous.
---
But formally the game didn't work like that. In the ensuing 15 years people have figured out how to optimize a thousand times better than anyone did in Vanilla.
---
By actually leaving it in place you end up changing raid culture significantly from what it was. Culture changed on the pservers. All the lapsed players who never touched them don't want the pserver experience, they want the Vanilla experience.
---
I don't have to convince you. The fact that you don't understand what we are talking about doesn't need convincing. And how i use my time is not your concern, at all. You don't dictate how i use my weekend. If i don't have time to educate you then i don't. If i have 20 seconds to write back to post in reddit, then i have. The fact that you use my time as an argument shows how much problems your logic haves even on basic level. You really need to start putting more on your education. Maybe the world wouldn't be so confusing then and there wouldn't be the need to get convincing from the randoms in Reddit.
---
You can for sure link to the add-on from your site! The curseforge one is still waiting on verification, and I'll have a link to a 1.12.1 version soon
---
I will think I prefer face stomping and not huge cooldowns so warrior is winning my heart. Thanks
---
Hidden friends joke in a wow joke in a moot point joke. I like this community
---
Having only leveled twice in BC (and never in vanilla), I don't understand how you can think -- regardless of size -- familiarizing yourself with quests and zones could possibly be a bad thing?
---
Affliction Warlock - Mambo Italiano while you DoT
---
What the fuck is this shit dude?
---
If you're arguing that only bad players follow guides, and good players do not, and now in the new reality, the good players also follow guides, doesn't that make them bad players then? :D
---
I see what you did there.
---
Most of the time Healing Touch is preferred to the HoTs anyway because of mana efficiency.
---
But this wasn't something done regularly in Vanilla. This is something that developed on a pserver.
---
Pservers nerfed the gold farm not because it hurts the economy but it hurts the lining of their pocket. Also chances are the DM gold farm won’t be as lucrative in classic since the items dropped by the lashers were merged in vanilla. Very likely pservers have that off on the list of other things that are off.
---
I'm giving you Mark of the Wild and Thorns and YOU'LL FUCKING LIKE THAT SHIT!
---
I don't see many priest mentions. It's a seatbelt class. It's like playing soraka janna or Morgana support in league. Super dull and and does not impress me
---
And with one single comment you have killed the thread. People thought you were serious until this.
---
Wouldn't Nightfall be wanted for the raid? What phase does that come out in?
---
I'd like more free-form arena content. Stuff like the Gurubashi arena.
---
I do agree, or atleast for first few months after the raid release. But doesn't matter really, do it after classic if you want major changes.
---
I still maintain that any mmo launching with a launch as bad as WoW has in 2004 would be DOA in today’s gaming climate. Unstable servers for months? Yeah no one is lasting that.
---
I never raided in classic and the collecting of world buffs before a raid doesn't sound appealing to me. I'm for this change, that way I don't *have* to learn how to get them and it will make getting into end game raiding easier.
---
Oh gosh, get it out of your system.
---
Done? Good
---
I loved season 8 got and I don’t like retail wow. Deal with it mate
---
&gt;But this wasn't something done regularly in Vanilla.
---
So what? You had the choice to use them in raids during vanilla, if you remove that choice its no longer the way vanilla was.
---
In the true spirit of \#nochanges.
---
They would be limited at very expensive. players could sell the houses/lots to other players. like 500 lots per server.
---
I never knew there was a cross faction AH. What items is this AH used for mainly?
---
Not an option for most people just like it wasn’t then.
---
This would be nothing like garrisons. These would be houses in a shared area.  They would be limited at very expensive. players could sell the houses/lots to other players. like 500 lots per server.
---
Upvoted. Let's get this to the top boys.
---
If the anecdotes I have read, or the video is to be believed, then yes you will be. I am not going to be a casual player playing in a casual guild with 14 moonkins just for the luls. I am also not going to logoff to preserve a fucking buff.
---
Pepega just dont do it then Pepega. Listen, small brain - those all hinges on if the toxic atmosphere of private servers stinks up classic. If it doesn't - no problem. If that shit becomes mandatory, it shouldn't be in classic. Does a SMOrc such as yourself understand that?
---
Well, modern wow is trash so not really a valid argument.
---
The world is so much more alive when you just run into players you know. Are they going to put your entire friends list in the same layer? Thats not going to be possible.
---
You also recognized horde players often. 
---
I also just realized that 1.12 means they will implement cross realm BGs. 
---
I was so dissapointed when that went live. Fighting against the same guys in WSG and AV developed some real personal competition. Loved that shit.
---
Guess its a pass from me.
---
Husband wants to play Paladin.
---
Guess I'm human now.
---
37 IQ
---
I had that shroooooms
---
Probably. Which again isn’t as bad as everyone wants to believe. Also was very well received when it launched. I know my server went from 2 hour queues to under 30 min queues.
---
&gt; now in the new reality
---
what's that? I am saying that only bad players follow guides and do not think about them.
---
Dunno what you're talking about.
---
Back in my day, we used Linen Bandages on you outside Orgrimmar so you'd always have the Recently Bandaged debuff during duels.
---
Back in my day, we filled your mailbox with *Peeling the Onion* (a grey book that couldn't be vendored) and your bags with Heavy Leather Balls.
---
Back in my day, if you saw a Hunter taming a pet, you killed that fucking beast dead.
---
Back in my day, you left one shitty item in the chest for the next poor sap. Or better, cast BoP on them so they couldn't loot it and you could take it yourself.
---
Back in my day, you spammed that fucking rat whistle in the Auction House forever.
---
Back in my day, you used Aspect of the Pack in Battlegrounds and only Aspect of the Pack.
---
Nah, they actually said they were specifically opened to a 1.14, you can google it. Which would mean changes to classic.
---
I think it would be cool to have a 'Companion Addon' nav-link at the top of the bobo-talents website which takes users to a page which has an explanation of your addon.
---
1. Is there a better way for me to credit your work besides linking to your wowinterface/curse/reddit accounts?
---
2. Are your wowinterface and curse links "permanent"? If not, can you give me permanent links?
---
3. Can you PM me the types of information you'd like to have on the page? I intending to add some basic instructions but could use your help with that, given I don't have access to classic Beta.
---
Raid-wise bite is the only option since you're likely to go with a wolf. 
---
PvP-wise having both is better (for added burst) if you go with the typical cat. 
---
For leveling/solo grinding can't be precise enough.
---
Don’t get too caught up with what that guy is saying. Shamans are definitely best at healing, but at the end of the day the hardest thing for guilds to do is going to be getting 40 people online with the same schedules. People are going to be scrambling to get whatever they can. Play whatever you want, man. This sub is obsessed with “bis” as if the server is going to give you a warning at character creation about raid imbalances. There might be 2 big guilds with perfect raid makeups and everyone else is leftovers
---
The... smell...
---
Just hope its not raining.
---
Until then, let people abuse it. Why should we bother
---
So don’t play until it’s removed. I know plenty of people who are taking that route. That’s fine.
---
You're making it my concern when you're spending your time insulting me.
---
Yet, I must admit it's hard to take it seriously when you say I have problems with logic on a basic level when you unironcally claim that me calling out an outrageously terrible comparison makes you right especially when you refuse to even explain how you thought the comparison made sense.
---
Not when noone has any gold. You can't really sell things on the AH for a large profit at launch because noone has money to buy them.
---
Dirty!
---
When summoning an imp, is there dialogue that promptly follows? I remember there being dialogue such as “why can’t we all get along!” Being in real vanilla (could be wrong idk)
---
That is the best thing about wow.
---
This is the kind of content I followed this sub for
---
An exploit is defined as an intended game mechanic being used to create unintended outcomes. Using knockback from a rocket launcher to rocket-jump is an exploit.
---
The dragon head turn-ins are intended to give buffs, but the unintended behavior is logging out a whole week after a nef head turnin to use in BWL the following week, or in general, the social behavior of players putting pressure on players to keep the buffs at all costs, including *not playing the game at all*.
---
It cleanly fits the definition of an exploit. MMOs are more than strictly mechanical games. Mechanics that influence the social mesh of the game need to be taken into serious consideration.
---
&gt; Not fair since EU game didnt even exists at that moment
---
"I didn't buy EU collectors edition so it's not fair that those who did get the benefits from buying EU collectors edition".
---
Why didn't you buy it?
---
You can get rank 9 at 49 and then rank 10 at 59. CP from bgs at 49 is 57% but youll win more as a twink so Id expect  between 30 and 40% slower grind but as one of the strongest chars rather than one of the weakest.
---
Cool. But this just automates gameplay and decision-making that made vanilla what it was so... Not really cool in that regard.
---
Yea that also wouldn't work either,  to many people would complain they couldn't have one
---
&gt; WoW Classic has loot trading in raids. One person can collect all the loot and give it out at the end of the raid (or within 2 hours).
---
I get that, my question was more as to why. I usually carry mats for enchanting new pieces straight away, so this potentially hurts the performance - think a warrior getting his new MH at the end of the raid. I get in order for your method to be quicker you have to do this after the raid but I do not think that is a trade-off I would like to make.
---
Fair enough.
---
It's all ours.
---
Another part with wbuffs is that they feel valuable, if you die you get pissed so you "feel" liek you have to be alive and dont fuck up. 
---
Other part is that if youtry and take them and you have pissed off anotther guild, they might come and snipe you, leading to more dynamic gameplay.
---
I Agree that it is annoying AF sometimes but you don't NEED Wbuffs to clear raids.
---
i doubt the people developing the private server emulation software nerfed DM so others can make bank with dubious transactions.
---
i hope DM farm wont be as broken as presumed, the official /camp macro is helping a bit with that aswell (so you gotta run out of the instance instead of porting)
---
still, making more than 50g per hour FOR ME doesnt feel like classic (but, apparently, it was), thats the whole point im trying to make.
---
This. 
---
If you want to play Prot Pally then going a guild, learn to heal in Holy and gain their respect and then get Prot gear and become the Servers popular 5-10man speed running Tank.
---
It's literally Win-Win and you don't have to force other players to compensate for you.
---
https://forum.elysium-project.org/topic/23265-warrior-2h-weapons-throughout-leveling-1-60/
---
Google classic wow 2h weapon progression. There are a few guides for it.
---
I'll swp onyxia if I feel like it.
---
If you do a buncha stuff you forget about it for a while
---
Then how did you end up in this thread? None of this should affect you and your fellow godlike players at all since none of you follow any guides to begin with, whether they're in-game or not. :)
---
They are a little too powerful imo, and it creates a very toxic culture both amongst players (Which is arguably very fun as well) but also within yourself (If you lose your buffs early on, gg now you have to wait until next week to have competitive dps). Also a pain to acquire all of them before every raid and this is mandatory in hardcore and semi-hardcore guilds. 
---
I would say, disallow songflower &amp; DM buffs from being used in raids. Maybe DMF as well but these 2 should be the first to go. 
---
This way you are keeping raid content relevant because people will always want to use these word buffs and you’re still giving people room to maximize their performance and wpvp and wiping guilds will still happen, it just won’t be as catastrophic.
---
Farming was in MoP. Housing was in WoD. Please go back to retail.
---
I've bought myself wotlk and then over the years automatically got upgraded, currently on Legion. Will I have access to classic?
---
Even +30% at level 21. Yeah it's that good.
---
The patch notes for 1.9 state in plain text that they were linked once that patch hit.
---
Can you dismount with a macro? Would love to have a macro that let's me dismount one the first push of the button and then cast nova on the second
---
Id think it's easier and cheaper to find another twink and boost their char in exchange for them boosting yours. Good plan, regardless.

There's literally ogres with stealth, like huge ass ogres way bigger than taurens.  So how exactly does a tauren stealthing break the game's own rules?
---
The queues were better but it killed a lot of the fun for me. I was so dissapointed, along with many other of my friends.
---
But i know the queues on alliance on my server wasnt too bad compared to other servers.
---
You just dont care as much playing against random people youll never see again, with random people youll never see again.
---
If a horde guild would queued up for AV you would bet your ass we would know about it and make a counter queue. You knew what was going on.
---
WoTLK killed wow by taking it even further imo.
---
Where did you find this discussion?
---
We're speedrunners. Every second counts. I'm sure a case could be made ahead of time, but it won't be an every boss occurrence.
---
It’s not optimal. It’s a choice made by one gamer based off their time.
---
I didn’t play at vanilla but I personally used it in bc/wotlk to make some money by farming pets in horde zones/recipes in horde zones and selling them there because on alliance side these things were kinda rare.
---
I remember screwing up one time and made a rather disparaging, yet truthful, remark about huntards in raid chat.
---
I couldn't disagree more.
---
Even if you log out for a week (which is literally the most extreme example you could possibly muster) you cannot possibly suggest the world buffs were not intended to be used in raids.
---
So more like PvP events? I think that was originally planned in Arathi Highlands or something?
---
Oh... oh no...
---
If you watch the video in the op you have a guy from DnT talking about it. I'm not just pulling it out of my ass.
---
Thanks, replicated it there!
---
Mage. All you do is make drinks and city portals for people. Sure you make more money, but all it does it pay the repair bills for how often you die.
---
WC has the cool event thing tho.
---
I used to do this for hours in AV.
---
Gah, ain't that the freaking truth... Knees weak, arms are sweaty, OOM!!
---
several orders of magnitude is larger than the difference between your starting weapon and Naxx weapons
---
Actually, I used to not get along that well with other paladin players in my guild. Out of about 8 of them, there was ONE which I got along with great, and the rest were mostly mouth breathers.
---
I made the most friends at 29, but spent the most time by far at 59. The community felt more like pre-coss-server BGs, where you'd get to know people and their playstyles, and create rivalries, but you'd be unable to get Naxx epics, rank 14 weapons, etc.
---
I’m  using an addon to dismount called classic dismount, hitting any spell that you can’t use while mounted will dismount you, then another press to cast the spell. It probably does just use a macro although I never looked into it.
---
That a big invitation for more mafia guilds
---
Of course they will
---
How does one get one
---
You’re not talking about AQ40 the movie are ya? It was like an hour long and multiple songs.
---
Yup
---
I wish they would remove them in raids personally.
---
One of the reasons I disliked Naxx in classic was because of the wasted time every raid night getting world buffs.  It would take over an hour of just riding around getting them.
---
Then if we wiped or people got killed by the horde trying to get to the raid it would cause tons of drama and was super toxic.  Caused a bunch of people to always get mad at each other and people to quit etc. 
---
World Buffs are just overall not fun.
---
Awww, insults. How cute, hahaha. 
---
Well on that note, you could have saved us both some time replying with a simple disclaimer: 
---
“Hey guys, I’m going to misuse words like ‘exploit’ and ‘forced’ to push my agenda of crying for balance changes to Classic. Oh, and if you disagree I’m going to result to insults because I’m an epic XD twitch memer fornite dancing in social studies class XD”
---
No such thing as "abuse" in this situation. Just people playing an mmorpg with each other.
---
Well i would be more concerned why you want to be insulted again and again then (even though i am not insulting, just making observations and statements). And there is something you take seriously, otherwise you wouldn't feel the need to make this these "logical" arguments. You have lost your credibility from the 1st post you made to me. You can't make comeback anymore from this.
---
Call me terrible if you like, I have you the recipe to prevent unnecessary  wipes.  If you like to wipe on tanks ignoring your mana bar then fine by me.  
---
I have been healing since beta -&gt; cataclysm when I abandoned wow.  I don’t scream, I don’t rage quit but I let the group know I decide who lives/dies and my goal is making the run as smooth as possible. If I have to break a few egos then so be it.  I had a health reputation back in the day because runs with me didn’t contain drama.  
---
I set expectations, as I did when I was tanking.  It’s the best way to avoid drama if everyone knows the boundaries.   It’s the same thinking as dealing with over aggro dps as a tank.  After chasing then for a few times you just ignores the mobs as they will return to you once the dps is dead.  A death or two will teach the dps to stay inline.
---
From the mindset of competitive players I am curious why it is needed to go through this much work. Obviously the leadership knows what the best gear is for any given class. Could they not just assign the loot quickly through loot council, even if it is just a 1 player ML as many competitive guilds use, or is this more about preventing loot drama?
---
Our guild used world buffs but we also had world firsts. Alliance on laughing skull server. 
---
No way in hell I'm going that hard this time around. I'm happy to never see Naxx again.
---
Pallys. The class fantasy is definitely not for me.
---
Same...i wish it would be that simple again...
---
It occurs to me to wonder if, whenever we get classic TBC servers, it will again be possible to macro the BM rotation so that you can just spam the shit out of your mousewheel and still do top DPS.
---
I would not be averse to this.
---
How is preparing for a raid anything like buying things on a sale?
---
If you want to do the most dps you can then you prepare with mats and buffs. If you don’t mind being low dps and getting carried mostly then don’t worry about it :)
---
Or are you trying to change everyone’s mind so they don’t make you grind for mats? ;)
---
Why are you giving grammatical lessons about commas on a WoW sub?
---
Dps roles in general, not a class in particular. Years, and years, and years of tanking and healing in mmo's has made me develop a rather fierce hatred of dps'ers and their usual proneness to be being stupid and inept. It's to the point where I rather not dps so that I do not feel like I associate with them.
---
Thank you very much
---
What other niche things do you want to remove from the game?
---
Gimp spelladins? Those wherent common during vanilla so i guess you want to teak paladins a bit so they arent viable.
---
Yeah.. I seem to have killed my own hype with this thread. Maybe just leave it be, spent enough time in wow classic in my teens.
---
Death stranding looks good
---
Because already had USA collectors edition, why buy the game twice
---
Honestly have no idea what you mean by templating and haven't played WoW for at least 6 years. 
---
When I say balanced I mean in the form that Vanilla was balanced like adding DR on stuns so rogues couldn't just stunlock you to death i.e. it's under the assumption that it will be somewhat fair.
---
Anf the economic is fucked since people used layering to farm
---
Not really a question but I wish they left the ability to increase nameplate visibility distance  after playing AV... even if they reduced the max  to 36y or 41y.
---
do you think they are trying to tell us something?
---
Perfect thank you
---
Warlock class chat is best class chat.
---
If in 1.12 they accidentally added a bug where pressing a certain sequence of spells immediately one shot any boss/player and this went unnoticed until TBC where every raid started one shotting bosses until they fixed it. Would removing this one shot sequence in Classic be a balance change even though nobody noticed it until TBC?
---
Wasn't Avenging Wrath released in WoTLK?
---
I didn't say order of magnitude. I said magnitude.
---
If you're going to be pedantic with me it helps that you actually read what I said.
---
bro what? that doesn’t look like goldshire at all lmao
---
Wait until your first raid wipes because you are telling all the casuals it will be so easy. ;)
---
I will never going to join a guild with loot council. DKP is fine and you can apply rules to DKP as well.. for example, Hunter will not get the Sword/dagger from Rogue because he has more DKP, as well as rogue will not get the Bow before the Hunter, etc.
---
Locks dont have that demand.
---
&gt;Dungeons are *ok*, but pretty cancer with the M+ affixes.
---
M+ is just cancer. Adding such a Hack n slash mechanic in an MMO changed dungeons from an enjoyable experience to a chore.
---
Oh... That is just... Damn.
---
Its the World of "filler title" that is bothering me the wrong way the most.and this game has 
---
* dailies
---
* professions 
---
* world boss quest
---
* Raids
---
* Dungeons
---
* Mounts
---
* WoW soonish graphics
---
I disagree. Generally I see them all as rivals and most of my friends aren't even in my guild. I just show up, try to out damage or out heal my peers, then go do stuff with my friends. Pretty much how guilds have always worked out for me.
---
In the chance someone has played vanilla, testing new classes and specs to see what they want to play. Not everyone playing beta, played vanilla.
---
Man this stuff gets posted about ever god damn second
---
Wouldn't changing these buffs' timers to run out even while offline fix the big "can't play my character" problem?
---
Is this just a list of what your playing or what is this?
---
Probably references the Artifact weapons from Legion.
---
no worries my friend :P
---
Not goldshire goldshire, it just looks like a familiar area I flown over with a griffin,thats why I said sherlock Holmes ppl examine this evidence and decide
---
Because if you're chain running dungeons for 10 hours straight, shaving 15 seconds off every pull adds up to literally hours of time.
---
Now multiply that by every time you play the game.  Would you rather do a 2 hour UBRS run or a 1 hour run?  Personally, if I'm binging on a Saturday, I'd rather get twice as many runs done in the same amount of time because everyone was on the ball and going hard.

Okay then, find me a single source that says they were ever not linked or prrof that any of the Auctioneers from Stormwind, Darnassus, Undercity, or Thunder Bluff ever existed before patch 1.9.

You can't, because they didn't.
---
Imagine getting hostile and then trying to cry about being insulted.
---
Is this trolling? Argue that it would be a good idea to make them not have an effect inside raids if you want, but don't pretend there's a way to justify it under a nochanges philosophy
---
Agreed. Rogue. Just avoid felhunter Warlocks. Or play an sl SL lock and afk in enemy territory.

I agree with that Fjuben, but I think housing offers lots of immersion like it did in Ultima Online.
---
Horde lots of warriors are orc so they get axe skill, alliance human get sword skill so both warriors and rogues gunning for swords as they are bis, meanwhile horde they kinda want axe primarily
---
Templating means pvp and pve have individual scalings. For example when you enter arena in the current expansion your azerite traits are weaker than they are in PVE
---
Damn, why did he get so mad? I remember I used to get excited and there was an adrenaline rush when i knew the enemy team was doing the boss and we had someone telling us his hp% on chat haha. It was fun no matter who got it. Also it’s not like he gets to keep the honor, it’s a test character.
---
because before season 8 there was a season 7, 6, 5 and 4. much like how people realized wow was becoming lazy development after tbc many people have realized that game of thrones became lazy writing after season 3.
---
&gt; As such your contention isn't with the buffs but rather the lengths people may go to in the most extreme circumstances possible to maintain them.
---
Correct. Obviously you can get another guild's nef buff right before your own BWL. The exploit is preserving the buff beyond its 3 hour timer.
---
&gt; Which I would also contest is not an exploit.
---
And you'd be wrong. You can't judge the mechanics of an MMO with the same lens as you'd judge a single-player game. An MMO is much greater than its mechanics in a vacuum. It is very clearly unintended by Blizzard that community members could pressure other community members *not to play the game* to preserve a buff. If it were a single player game, this would be fine - but WoW is not singleplayer. 
---
As I said, this is a very clear example of an intended mechanic being used in an unintended way. In other words, an exploit.
---
Im not going to google something I know isnt true.
---
The no-no change crowd will be here shortly to REEEE at you.
---
Answered this in the classicplus thread but doing it here as well:
---
* **Horizontal Progression through Set Bonuses**
---
I think this is too little and too late (game) and a lot of issues for example retribution paladins were in some ways fixed in WotLK and druids in general in TBC. Having changes to the talent trees to accommodate changes and removing "cookie cutter specs" and making more specs viable would be more impactful, a lot of the earlier sets for druids and paladins gave stats to everything and could **potentially** be utilized, for example. Another way is to get token drops instead of loot from bosses as it was in TBC where you can choose a set piece depending on your spec.
---
* **Cosmetics**
---
Having not played retail since my first month of Cata I cannot speak for cosmetics or collectibles but they should not be a substitute for real content as is seemingly the case with retail. I am curious as to what kind of cosmetics are being referred to though so any examples would be welcome.
---
* **Player Housing**
---
Don't really see the need for this, is there any particular reason?
---
* **World PvP System**
---
I never did much PvP in WoW but I personally was not a fan of the way the system worked, we had one guy in my guild that eventually got R14 and he quit the game shortly afterwards. I would personally like to see a re-worked system and adding bonuses to world PvP is an interesting take, it can either be a separate system all together or it can add bonuses to existing ones. It cannot replace the arena in terms of the PvP experience though but it could very well be part of a seasonal ladder, maybe one for world PvP, one for arena, and one for BGs?
---
* **Event System**
---
Could also be a way to add more content or make content repeatable, interesting idea!
---
* **New Classic Races**
---
* **Boats**
---

hating on streamers and layering
---
I get warning your group that you're mana hungry, but I really hope you dont let people die because you're only at 48% mana...
---
less utility than a warrior???
---
Not so others can,  so they can. Both Nost and Ely which is where the other gets the core had back door behind the scenes deals with gold sellers. I really doubt the other doesn’t either.
---
You’re welcome :)
---
Definitely not a tier list, or a most played list.
---
Yes, personal preferences.
---
alright buddy, hit us with your finest memes
---
Its not preserving it beyond the timer, that's a deliberate obfuscation of the truth. It's still the same tree hour timer.
---
Given that you're willing to obfuscate like that, it's clear to me who is actually wrong here.
---
&gt; Well i would be more concerned why you want to be insulted again and again then
---
And there we have it again an absolutely clear example of your inability to utilize logic.
---
Not caring about something happening is *vastly* different from wanting it to happen.
---
&gt; even though i am not insulting, just making observations and statements). 
---
Well, we could go with slander instead, if that's what you'd prefer
---
&gt; You have lost your credibility from the 1st post you made to me
---
Again, this is so ironic coming from a guy whose first post to me was that the only reason you would want information that you could react to in a video game is because you're blind.
---
100% agree.. They definitely  weren't intended to be used how they are. Ony Buff and WB are two that I could possibly see being put in for the use of a buff for the whole raid. But I would bet my bottom dollar DMT was not meant for 40 people to go snag.. Then again I don't gamble so who knows.. but I do agree
---
I always prefer push to talk so I don't hear people mashing their keyboard, or a dog/kid/baby in the background. Or since it's sweaty neckbeard season even in August, not hearing the fans or AC they have running in their room.
---
WoW PvE isn't a game you need to treat like WoW PvP with constant communication, push to talk works perfectly fine in PvE and I prefer to not hear their background noise.
---
“Moon glow” spec is a popular spec for resto druids once they get enough crit gear
---
My guild killed KT and we never used them outside of Lotheb / 4 horseman / Sapphiron and KT.
---
And even then we generally only did the Onyxia and ZG buffs.  Didn't do Dire Maul or anything else.
---
We never even considered using them for earlier bosses because it isn't fun to run around getting them.
---
Now though everyone uses them for even the weekly MC or BWL clear.
---
Welcome to world of casual craft.
---
Try playing osrs if you think world buffs are too much grinding lol.
---
I was more thinking of a minimal change that would let people actually play the game.
---
Ah I see, thanks for the response
---
The exploit you're saying exists is... not playing?
---
Right. Almost like the guy you're replying to was being sarcastic?
---
Jeez so basically nothing.
---
Loot Council is based on the opinions of others, Loot Lists never are.
---
homegrown tomatoes
---
How do you do, fellow kids?
---
Il do my job. But wiping because You only got 10% mana is not worth it. 
---
If it’s more time efficient to let them die /Rez then then spend 15m Corps running.  Because that’s what’s the scenario above is.  That’s the two options you got when tanks pull premature.  
---
If I deem it doable then il heal then hell most times i do bad judgment calls and try and save it resulting in OOM and everyone dead with a long corps run.  
---
If you let the tank know before hand what’s going to happen in a friendly way.  They know when they FU.  
---
“Hello im your friendly healer for this run, please take a look at my Mana bar (blue bar below my name) if this is below 50% you will most likely cause a wipe.  And I might choice to run of and shadow meld to save corps run time”.  
---
Setting frame will help you
---
How much better is +spell damage than just regular “of the eagle” gear for leveling?
---
I saw someone adjust this while streaming with a /script command. Unfortunately I don't remember the command.
---
 `Players will now be able to buy and sell goods with greater  effectiveness using the Linked Auction House system. Auction Houses in  Orgrimmar, Undercity, and Thunder Bluff will now share the same pool of  Horde player-created auctions, and Alliance players will find the same  to be true when visiting Ironforge, Stormwind City, and Darnassus  Auction Houses.`
---
OG - Online game.
---
They should just keep world buffs but make the timer continue even if you log off. Logging off to preserve buffs is an exploit, but using the buffs themselves is not.
---
He literally reads the definition of the word "exploit" and spends rest of the video making a case why world buffs qualify as one.
---
You know people do the speedruns for fun to see how well they can do and not because it's faster to do it on raidnight. Speedclearing was never about saving time.
---
Obviously speedrunning has tons of preparation in any game not just wow.
---
People should join a guild with the expectation that everyone else will be as dedicated as they are.
---
If you are a casual or want to play meme specs, join a casual guild where no one is expected to bring consumables or play the good specs. There will be tons of different guilds with different expectations I'm sure everyone will find one suited for them.
---
Stop crying about what dedicated players do with their time.
---
switch friends!
---
Oh sweet I didn’t no that. Playing a high pop private server those quests are rough
---
I still have mine as well. Are they worth something by now?
---
I'm right there with you, anything to make a mechanic less toxic. But that crowd will refuse to compromise to make it a better experience.
---
&gt; they want the Vanilla experience.
---
Which means leaving the world buffs in, since they existed during vanilla.
---
If you remove the choice of getting them you change the raiding culture even more.
---
Guessing you’re talking about this one? - not quite the one I’m looking for, but definitely of similar cinematic quality! 
---
https://youtu.be/yiHcWO6KGpc
---
Loot Council's strength is you gear your best players first. It's why DKP is so flawed. Some shitter might get the BiS when he won't take advantage of it like your top tier player.
---
Loot Council works fine if you set restrictions. One person isn't gonna get 4 pieces of loot in the raid before his other class gets 1 because that upsets the others.
---
/u/BeethovenTheMage    
---
&gt; Okay, then find me a single source that says they were ever not linked or prrof that any of the Auctioneers from Stormwind, Darnassus, Undercity, or Thunder Bluff ever existed before patch 1.9.
---
This is the second time in two days you've directly contradict provable fact because your memory said otherwise... It is an ongoing problem with you. I cannot tell if you're trolling or really believe all the erroneous corrections you keep making.     
---
&gt; World of Warcraft Client Patch 0.8.0     
---
&gt;   
---
&gt;  Auction Houses      
---
&gt; Auctioneer NPCs have been placed in each major city (Stormwind, Ironforge, Darnassus, Orgrimmar, Thunder Bluff and The Undercity). The Auctioneer's are faction specific, allowing Alliance characters to trade with other Alliance characters and Horde characters to trade with other Horde characters. Each city's Auction House is run independently; all Auctioneers that exist in the same city are all a part of the same Auction House.     
---
&gt; One non-faction based Auction House is located in Booty Bay. The Booty Bay Auctioneer NPCs have the same functionality as the aforementioned faction based Auction Houses, with the additional capability of allowing trade between Horde and Alliance characters.     
---
So you're wrong. Again.
---
&gt;Rolls mage
---
&gt;Thinks hes more than a water cooler that can sheep mobs.
---
Topkek.
---
^^^(/s)
---
Yeah it reminds me of the people that criticize PVP videos. Where are your videos so that we can judge your skill ?
---
That is not proof the auctions houses in SW, Darn, UC, and TB ever existed before. It could easily mean the *new* auction houses in these cities will be linked to the main ones. Which is exactly what happened.
---
Thats the best talent calculator out there! I love the fact that keep the order you get the talents!! I was creating builds the whole afternoon :P
---
Same here, I never played Horde in Vanilla through Wrath so I’m looking forward to all the quests I never got to experience.
---
Dunno about that, Wotlk arena was a clusterfuck. At least in Classic you know wtf is happening in a battle.
---
And Gadgetzan? And Everlook? And Ratchet?
---
**THIS** is when the druid or shaman steps up and and gets a hybrid boner.
---
Oh yea that’s the one. I used to watch that so much on warcraftvideos.
---
Why is it bad that people wish half the specs in the game weren't garbage?
---
Classic's biggest weakness is class/spec balancing 100%. It would be a near perfect game if all specs were truly viable. Half the specs are memey bad.
---
BC/WOTLK have pretty damn good class balance overall.
---
You want world buffs gone because you're scared a Guild/Raid leader will tell you to log out so you can be top DPS. Is that what I'm reading here?
---
It's actually really easy to find quest rewards.
---
Go to classicdb.ch. Run a search for weapons. Set the max required level of the item to a really low value like 1 or 2. Set the item level to whatever you want to filter results. Sort by dps. 
---
And there, [on page 1](https://classicdb.ch/?items=2&amp;filter=minl=20;maxl=40;maxrl=2;#0-6+1), is your [cresecent of forloron spirits.](https://classicdb.ch/?item=2044).
---
Also, don't worry too much about the guys telling you to have a slow 2 hander. there is real value in getting fast 1 handers while leveling: first of all, with this melee leeway stuff, it's by no means clear that hamstring kiting is even going to work. Second, a lot of mobs cannot be hamstrung kited effectively, due to them having roots, but mostly, due to them having very slow swing timers (for example, murlock warriors have a 3 second swing timer.
---
Beyond that, at low levels, hamstring kiting is EXPENSIVE. Hamstring is 10 rage and you often have to apply it twice, on tough mobs. 20 rage per fight is a ton of rage.
---
Demo shout is often not much worse, if any, damage reduction, and you will NEVER have to reapply demo shout, and you can also demo shout without using an important global, by using it while out of melee range of the enemy, as it's basically a ranged ability. you can also demo shout multiple mobs and you don't need to risk aggroing extra mobs by doing it.
---
Don't get me wrong, on pservers I hamstring kite all the time, but don't be afraid to stop if your equipment no longer justifies it. 
---
Also, in classic, leveling weapons sounds like a real mess, so it may be really handy to level 1 handed axes without having to roll need on every weapon in dungeon drops. You don't have to marry a 1 handed axe, but swinging one for half a level might be a good idea. 
---
As for why this weapon is not super popular?
---
Well, if you run deadmines, it's less dps than the taskmaster axe or smite's mighty hammer, (drops), but it's also worse dps than the staff of westfall, which I have seen some leveling guides recommend as a consolation prize (it's also worse than the emberstone staff, which I have gotten from deadmines a nonzero number of times, but mostly just when the clothies were trying for the stirring rod and already had it). 
---
Also, I don't know that you are doing that quest at 22. It only requires 22, but it's a 13 part quest that requires you to travel all over hell, as I recall, and if you manage to do all that without dinging, you still have to fight a level 32 mob at the end, which is REAL hard prior to about level 27-28. 
---
To be honest, while I think what you are attempting is really cool, dungeon drops are way better loot. At level 22,  you can have run deadmines enough to get  a ~18dps weapon and had it for about 4 levels, and then at 25, you can start thinking about blackfathom deeps: the strike of the hydra (25! dps sword with a proc to damage on hit) is only a 20% drop chance, but rogues aren't rolling on it, and even if it doesn't drop you have chances at a blue cape (thresher), chest (turtle), and gloves (murloc). And a blue quest shield. All from one instance.
---
I farmed all of the dragon pets in Vanilla.  I don't recall them selling on the AH for crazy amounts.
---
Hi man!
---
My Guild recently began recruitment for the early days of classic. I'll throw a link your way just hmu through the application form  if you're interested!

---
The video is claiming that world buffs are so OP that raid groups will be pressured to get them before raids. However, history shows that very few guilds did this, including top-tier ones.
---
Also, you might want to work on your interactions. Not sure why you'd think that was a shitpost.
---
I remember very well our Warlock channel.. was always full of banter and good times. During raids but also all the time for other stuff.. Even survived Guild collapses etc at the start of Burning Crusade, became a Warlock channel of people from 2-3 guilds. Was a tight-knit community of locks and some handpicked members of other classes (2 priests and 1 warrior).
---
I would question what makes any one persons personal research magically superior to anothers. Again again, this is with the lense of competitive players that are meant to be knowledgeable.
---
Lol you’re thinking of locks. That’s the class you bring only for their utility. Unlike locks mages don’t do shit dps
---
Hunters say hi.
---
I get the feeling that he is maybe not a good person.
---
Will I need to purchase the current version of the game to play classic or can I get away with just buying vanilla. 
---
Quick shadowmeld.
---
Tell that to my curse of agony ticking away at 13 of your health every 3 seconds you feeble arcane puppet!
---
But yeah warlocks were fun pvp, but I was only brought to mc for my banish and soul/healthstones.
---
Tailor+Ench wouldn't be my first choice as a race but of course ymmv :o
---
Found a guy who never played on a vanilla private server. Somehow there is instantly a community formation as soon as the fresh server launches and people care, yet they don't on retail.
---
Pre-release patch notes of Alpha and Beta builds mean nothing.
---
Got it, you're just a troll.
---
No, based on what you shitposted I have a hard time believing you can read.
---
Digging around in the suggested on that one did get me to the one I was looking for though! 
---
https://youtu.be/Ks0sRormBaA
---
Of course not 
---
50% mana is because since I’m drinking I will be at 75% when you get hurt.  Pulling when I’m at 20-30% it’s a judgement call if I think we can make it or not.  
---
Most of the time I’m bad at pulling the plug early. Because as soon as you toss a shield or a hot your committed and can’t use it anymore. It’s really a split second decision.  
---
I’m just saying NE got this extra wipe/res option that should not be neglected.
---
You’re on a private server, aren’t you? Different frameworks, so these macros won’t work for you
---
I would contribute to the problem with terrible memes of another kind then.
---
No we don't
---
https://www.vanillafriends.com/
---
Great thanks
---
Haha, true! At least you can wear the cool plate gear around stormwind and in pvp.
---
Probably the standard enhancement build. There wasn’t much of a variation in talent builds.
---
It also depends on patch build, if that video was made *before*, or *after* the Windfury change.
---
“getting carried”
---
Yeah let me go ahead and get carried through raids people cleared while keyboard turning and mouse-clicking 15 years ago.
---
this is where you drink as much as you can until the tank is low, this is exactly how you should be running through dungeons, you don't have to stop drinking just because the tank pulls, wait until he needs healing to stop drinking
---
You are literally making the argument for removing them. 99.99% of the vanilla raiding experience did not have world buffs...
---
Bite is better but I don't think it's worth actually finding the pets with good ranks of bite.
---
I played a night elf rogue in vanilla and I’m playing an undead priest for Classic.
---
I will be using my name.
---
Greater blessings make it really easy in 1.12
---
If u can stack much its very good, otherwise stam int int spirit is good
---
Im going to main a shaman, is there a best weapon type i should use for enhancement spec? Also do weapons skills matter for spell casters?
---
The thing with priests is that shadow isnt actually that good for leveling until you get shadowform.
---
The God tier leveling spec for priests sup 40 only dips into shadow for spirit tap, 3/5 spell hit, and longer sw:pain duration. 
---
So the play is to either go 5/5 spirit tap first, or 5/5 wand damage in the discipline tree first, depending on your wand/mana.
---
You can then either spec into holy or disc for the utility, because all of your damage will be from sw:pain and wands(open with either mind blast or holy fire/smite).
---
This allows you to *never * run out of mana. Once you hit 40 you get shadowform, and mind flay finaly starts to become mana efficient.
---
Aah, another hybrid spec apologist. The vermin are breeding I see.
---
same as saying "you don't enjoy chemistry? go study arts" advices, thank you xD
---
If you're choosing a loot system because you know you have members in your raid you'd rather replace, then just don't bring them.
---
And if Loot Council's strength is gearing your best players first, then you absolutely would give one person 4 pieces of loot before another player gets anything.
---
No, fuck no .... A big thing of classic was that people recognise your gear you can't hide and you can't show stuff you don't have. In PvP you are afraid of the people with the cool looking gear and in awe of geared people you see running around. It's a big point
---
You seem aggressive. What influence do worlds buffs have on you? If you dont want to log out to keep them, simply don't log out. If you raid leader is demanding that you log out to keep them, quit your try hard guild and go elsewhere. Your only reasoning for wanting them gone is because you think the mechanic is stupid and that you will be forced to alter the way you play the game because of it.
---
Also, asking you a question is not "shit posting," you sperg.
---
Hi, /u/HanMan37
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c1cqo0/recruiting_for_wow_classic_guild_horde/).
---
Ahhhhhh yes I see what you're saying now, I must've just read it wrong thanks for clarifying :)
---
Because what you posted was beyond a non-sequitur. 
---
Everything else you said is ignoring a decade+ of experience and private servers that disagree with you. I mean, I hope you are right, don't get me wrong, but I am not a person that generally relies on things like faith and hope. I'd rather they just remove world buffs in raids which, if I am right, will make classic a much better/truer experience to what it was then, and if you are right, would have negligible effects.
---
Retail WoW might not start until you're max level, but Classic starts as soon as you make your first character. Classic is RPG that just happens to be multiplayer. Leveling is part of that journey. Retail WoW is just another MMO where you log in, queue up, do a match, and log out. Same shit as LoL, Fortnite, Dota2, CSGO, or any other online multiplayer game these days.
---
There's plenty of reasons to play the Beta, same reason people clammer to play Betas or even Korean/Japanese/Thai versions of other games before they release officially for NA. You get to learn the game beforehand. Figure out what quest paths are optimal, what farming strategies are viable. Maybe you're on the fence about what class to play and the Beta helps you figure that out.
---
Also, the level cap (which is now 40 btw) introduced a unique, new, and weird meta for PvP that only those in the Beta will ever get to experience. It's kinda similar to how people used to make Twinks for BGs, there are distinct metas at 19/29/39, etc that can be really fun for certain classes. It's pretty cool how just one level (29-30) can change the meta entirely because of new abilities being available from talent points and certain items from quests (https://classicdb.ch/?item=6975).
---
And then there's also the obvious reason someone would want to play Beta....to test stuff duh. Classic isn't just a reprint of Vanilla, it's the assets and data from Vanilla layered on top of modern BFA code, so of course there's plenty of issues and bugs. I'd much rather discover, report, and help Blizzard fix the bugs before release, than run into those issues while leveling for real.
---
Classic is an entirely different beast than modern WoW and other MMOs. It's not for everyone, but hey, at least you can still go back and play BFA :)
---
Reckoning pally turns and claps you from the 5 stacks you gave him
---
Hey motherfucker, look at your next pre-patch notes:
---
&gt; Auction houses/Auctioneers will now exist only in Ironforge, Orgrimmar, and Booty Bay.
---
Patch 0.9
---
Fuck you.
---
u cant copyright gameplay or wow would be the only mmo, overwatch would be the only hero shooter, hots would be the only moba, and hs would be the only dtcg
---
the only other game in the world would be fortnite...
---
Don't have the math on tab, but iirc cat is almost always faster for leveling (some argument for screech, but imho the dps is more valuable).
---
In group content wolf buffs are easier to maintain dps with, but it depends on if the cat is at risk of dying.
---
WS also has the side benefit of looking better on meters compared to wolf. So pugs will be more easily impressed.
---
Only thing that is ironic here that your last sentence showed once again that you didn't understand what we were talking about in the first place, you don't understand it now. Again, i know you have problems with the concepts we were talking about and that is okay. Next thing you really need to try to understand is that it is not my job to educate you. Instead of writing to me how difficult things are for write some key words to Google instead. Telling these same things again and again starts to get little tiring. You should take my advice so you can get forward with your life.
---
Well I'm 52 and I dont do memes low effort or otherwise. What about you bub?
---
Oh man, I never noticed that. That icon comes from wc3, right? Dwarves could never even blink there, what were night elves doing with a dwarf blinking icon? 😂
---
I don’t think I could give an estimated time, but I guess it depends if you have a friend to run you through dungeons to grind BIS. 19 is definitely the quickest bracket to gear
---
The difference is really just how much stam is on a piece. Stam is highly needed in pvp, but it's not really considered for pve. Since items have a limited amount of stats, typically the best PvE items are stacked with damage increases but no stam, but that's not always the case, some items are just so crazy loaded that you get both. Another difference is hit. You need way less hit for pvp, and a lot of the best pve items are good because they give lots of hit.
---
if you've been drinking for 15s you should be at least 60% mana, for a random trash pull this is more than enough
---
How does a gnome have a saber here ?
---
I'm simply responding to what he commented to me. Why are you not minding your own business?
---
First, 500 houses would be a ridiculous looking area. Even 100 in 5 places. 
---
Second there are going to be a fuckton more people per server than before so instead of 2-3% getting houses it'd be like &lt;.01%. This would piss the majority of the population off. 
---
Third what would houses even be used for?
---
Fourth #nochanges
---
skipping natures swiftness is a big nono
---
Transmog doesn't allow you to appear to have loot you never owned.
---
I mean... there's no game to play... what high quality content are you expecting, exactly?
---
No problem. English is not my first language so I might be a lost in translation.
---
The classic patch is after windfury changes for two hands, but some people found a loophole to windfury with one handers, if you use the highest rank on your main hand, and a lower ranked one on the offhand. They work together rather than against.
---
this is wrong, you heal them to full and then drink, they can pull while you drink when they get low you stop drinking and heal, this is just efficient and works for most trash pulls
---
&gt;You are literally making the argument for removing them. 99.99% of the vanilla raiding experience did not have world buffs...
---
Or you should just learn to read, but i guess ill just repeat what i sai.
---
The choice of having world buffs in raids existed during vanilla, the fact that many chose not to does not mean you should remove the choice.
---
Just ask yourself this, where you able to have world buffs in raids during vanilla?
---
If yes, then it should be in classic aswell.
---
If you start removing things that where niche then you have a whole lot of removing to do.
---
It's only really if your duelwield weapons suck which typically is for mc. You will most likely never 2hfury ashkandi or dark edge as alliance. It's only really when you replace dalrends with a bonereavers or something like that.
---
For other situations, it's given to pvp warriors basically, whoever has an interest in pvp usually warrior prio but sometimes paladins can get it too, or even better ashkandi for hunters!
---
Classic will be the first time I've not tanked since TBC, I think the thing I will most is the relationship you build with your fellow tanks, assuming they are nice people.
---
It goes a long way when raid leaders like to ignore your concerns with certain strategies so you have to figure out a work around to stay alive and help others not die too.
---
How much mana you need to heal instance? None?! Okay!
---
I was there when it first popped up. This post is just to hear about others memories and stories but also another platform that people will likely see vs coming across vanillafriends.
---
They know.
---
Im in the same boat. I plan on doing what I did in Vanilla. Making friends in-game.
---
Barter. I played classic at launch and 3 private servers launches. Post your shit with what your looking for
---
I have no idea how long he was actually in the bg but if he was in there for hours and to lose by such a small margin I'd prbly be upset/mad too. Yeah it's just beta and a game but that's a lot of time put in just to lose that close.
---
Before you decide to play enhancement based on what you saw in that video, keep in mind that for each of those clips there's 10+ that didn't go nearly as well.
---
The problem is when people like you start saying, “if you don’t play like this you’re wasting *my* time”.
---
Engineering is the cheapest profession to level, it's like 100-200g depending on server.
---
I plan on rolling the same character I did years and years ago, but am unsure of where in the early patches Classic is picking up. Will Arcane Explosion have a casting time or is it instant cast on launch? Also, will the rolling ignite mechanics be in play? Just curious 
---
Also, in case any old friends see this: I was in a guild named Adventuring Fools on the PvE realm Malfurion. Please message me if you see this!!
---
None, I suppose. I deleted facebook exactly for that horrible disconnect I am feeling when im visiting here.
---
Paladin - never a bubble boy.
---
1.  Not really, You can link to my github, https://github.com/fusionpit if you wish
---
1. They should be permanent
---
1. I'll slide into those DMs
---
Not true. Level 45 mage water is the max available before the DM quest comes out.
---
One of the best feels
---
&gt; Also, asking you a question is not "shit posting," you sperg.
---
&gt;You want world buffs gone (strawman or improper premise) because you're scared (improper premise/ad hominem) a Guild/Raid leader will tell you to log out (faulty generalization) so you can be top DPS (faulty generalization). Is that what I'm reading here?
---
Just a question tho, totes not shitposting.
---
When it comes to vanilla, I'd never want to play a Paladin.  But I'm horde and my first toon was a Shaman, so..... there ya go.
---
You'd have to find out the Intellect to spell crit conversions for those levels, but at 60 its 59.5 Intellect per spell crit for a Mage.
---
Flying mounts.
---
19 rogue w 15 agi and crusader is nastyyy
---
You absolutely can just buy it, usually it's around 100-200g to level it, that is not worth all the effort it takes to level mining. 
---
Enchanting can get expensive but if you really put in the effort it can work, remember you do not need a skill requirement to disenchant items in vanilla, so you can just learn enchanting and disenchant everything you get from 1-60, hopefully that should help you on level it, but you will probably need to buy greens or dust.
---
Yeah. Find a good guild and your set I guess!
---
But I thought:   
---
&gt; Pre-release patch notes of Alpha and Beta builds mean nothing.     
---
Uh, DW wasn’t in Vanilla for Shaman.
---
Phase 1, so gurubashi will be in there from the very start.
---
it seems that any alliance race have been giving the black saber on the AV beta server. The Horde are equipped with Kodos.
---
Well at lvl 40 priests utterly dominate every other class. In the beta I've been beaten by priests in mediocre greens as a rogue in BIS (gutripper and the ST dagger)
---
imagine being this bad at the game and this much of a drama queen about it. just suck it up and heal the tank
---
Enhancement isn’t a memespec, it’s fine for pvp with great gear, you just won’t raid with it.
---
You would pay nearly the cost of a new game every month just for WoW?
---
They don't, because they were constantly adding and removing shit.
---
Don't be stupid. Oh wait, it's you.
---
I dont want to Start discussing that but it doesnt really disprove my Point that those farms were over the top.
---
The consequences of These extremely effective gold farms are already noticeable in a dynamic Economy but Producta like mounts have fixed prices.
---
I Just dont want to See everybody with an Epic mount 1 week after hitting maxlevel, thats doesnt feel right to me :/
---
At 19 if a twink rogue opens up the person they opened up on is deleted. Also who tf does organized pvp at 19? You just random queue
---
Im cringing at the thoughts of a healer telling me to wait for mana or when the tank waits for my mana and you have to command him to pull
---
"where I am forced to logout to preserve a buff for raid"
---
Literally your fucking words. Who is forcing you to log out? The IRS? Illuminati? Who is making you do this to preserve the raid buff?
---
Because it's completely pointless. It's like running 1h every day so you can complete your weekly 1 hour walk 20 minutes faster.
---
When I played retail horde and I did bg's, we would win 80% of the times.  This was common among horde from diff servers as well.
---
Mtg predates hs by quite some time. 
---
" the only other game in the world would be fortnite... "
---
Reminds me of a line from scrubs... "If they removed all the porn from the internet there would only be one site left and it would be called bring back the porn" I'm doing that from memory so it may not be 100% but the essence is there. :)
---
That's an interesting idea.
---
That’s because back in the day the sentiment was different. If a guild was all flasking and potting to kill a boss the first time they were made fun of for having more money than skill.
---
Today there’s a lot more of a min-max mentality to it which normalizes the cost. The reality is that nothing pre-Naxx was tuned to require any consumables, and even Naxx was mostly doable without.
---
You mean the majority that’s downvoted this post? Yeah
---
probably not. Devilsaurs are really hard to kill as a warrior, you should bring a friend in either case really, you most likely won't be able to farm devilsaurs alone at all.
---
I did it 14 years ago without consumables and world buffs and it was laughably easy. We just won't recruit mouth breathers and it'll be fine.
---
I'm of the mind the every spec should be viable at *something* but no spec *needs* to be viable at everything. If Shadow is already powerful in PvP maybe they should focus on one of the weaker specs or even a weird hybrid spec.
---
WhY aReNt ThErE bAnDaGeS fOr MaNa
---
If you are orc you will want to use two handed axes. https://classicdb.ch/?item=19169 this is an awesome weapon but pretty costly to get. For the other races it doesnt matter as much but two handed is best for enhancement.
---
For casters you should still level your weapon skills in your downtime because you dont know when you will find yourself out of mana and about to die and you need to melee and enemy. But it is less important overall.
---
Oh, so you were using it in the relative sense, and then trying to multiply that? That's incoherent, but not provably incorrect
---
Absolutely! That +6% is amazing. I was responding to someone having said they could get pyro at 20 though, which would have meant they put their first 11 points into fire and skipped the +hit talent.
---
I know it's only 10 levels late, but getting to 3/3 in elemental precision for the +6% hit makes you hit capped against mobs up to 2 levels higher than you, so imo it's worth maxing that talent as soon as possible, since it really opens up what mobs you can kill and therefore what quests you can do. This makes it a lot easier to do orange quests while you're leveling, which keeps you from having to move between zones as often while you're questing, and that can save you a ton of time.
---
The font is the only thing I recognize
---
&gt; Instead of writing to me how difficult things are for you write some key words to Google instead
---
I did try googling "why would players care about aesthetics in a game where doing so is detriment to your ability to play the game", but nothing of relevance came up.
---
But if you're so sure that you're correct and refusing to argue your position to me over and over is getting tiring, why don't you provide me with a link I can read?
---
So should I go out of my way to get these +frost spell damage gear or just keep questing away and use whatever I come across naturally?
---
They're strong as fuck in pvp too
---
Even if you save 1 minute, then technically it's not pointless is it? It also saves from misclicking which is another point.
---
Boi if you don’t quit
---
As a healer doing bfa dungeons, thank you for trying to play carefully. In the end pulling slow is still faster than wiping multiple times and having to run back with a repair bill.
---
Some tanks just go and go, even if they have shit gear and die. Had a tank with next to no hp was taking crazy damage and just wouldnt stop so I could take a break. Told him I was oom, but I dont think anyone on retail reads chat, so he pulled another group and died. Ended up healing the dps through it  and the tank starts flaming me for not healing him enough. 
---
A- I'm oom, B- if the dps survives better than a tank that's clearly not my fault.
---
So I stood there and started to rez the tank, jumped at the last second, did this 3 or 4 times then said "fuck this tank" and just left. I dont need the AP that badly.
---
Sorry for the rant, but impatient people have ruined dungeons for me.
---
&gt; You could list something in Thunder Bluff from the beginning.

https://web.archive.org/web/20060110044032/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/basics/auctionhouses.html
---
Only Ironforge, Orgrimmar and Gadgeztan had an AH at launch. I dont know when it was added to the other cities, probably in 1.9.0 when they were linked together?
---
There was reason Ironforge and Orgrimmar were the go to cities and SW/UC were more or less dead....
---
Well, I like it, so have my upvote :)
---
There were tons of guilds on private servers that didn't use world buffs (outside of Ony head, which doesn't really count). Why do so many people have this obsession with trying to curate Classic and turn it into something its not? If you don't want world buffs, join a guild that doesn't run them. They existed on pservers, they will definitely exist in Classic. And if they don't, then make your own. 
---
Trying to push for a change like this is shoving your own playstyle down the throats of others.
---
Maybe it felt like an RPG to you because you never played a proper RPG?  
---
WoW was always barebones RPG.
---
Google World of Kings on Googleplaystore 🤬😡😡😡🤨🤨🤨 fucking  thieves everywhere !!
---
a spec that relies on rng to such a degree is never "fine" for anything.
---
It's like having a really excitable guard dog
---
Cany wait to hate my life as I roll a priest again.
---
I mean it's perfectly coherent to me if you don't happen to know the exact formula but know it takes a lot to offset a 19% extra chance (roughly) on average to do nothing and generate no resources.
---
Aspect of the cheetah says hi
---
I'm quite sure you can do this by making a macro for the ability but at the start of the macro put
---
/cancelaura (mount name)
---
/cast (spell name)
---
Without the brackets of course.
---
Hope this helps and anyone correct me if I'm wrong.
---
Yeah after years of alliance, all my friends are on the horde train (or havent played since tbc/wotlk and want horde anyway). 
---
I am... sort of excited for new leveling but jfc I hate the horde models.
---
I have to warn you before you decide playing enhancement based on Unbreakable, it's an edited video of windfury procs, this doesn't represent reality. He also has hand of rag and full High Warlord gear at a point where most people had really bad gear. In reality you will be very weak most of the time, auto attacking and hoping for procs.
---
Enhancement can be a fun spec for pvp I made a twink shaman myself back in Vanilla and it was a lot of fun, although elemental is much stronger and enhancement is terrible in pve so if you want to raid as a shaman you will have to find a very casual guild that takes whatever and slowly progress through raids which is fine as long as you accept that or you will have to heal in raids.
---
If you really want to do it go for it but don't expect to be constantly WF One-shot people like you see in that video.
---
I don't think we have an exact list of his talents but there are tons of guides out there on how to play and build enhancement for pvp.
---
“I’m a hardcore Vodka raider okay but omg I don’t wanna log out blizz please come on change the game for me blizz.”
---
You’re hilarious.
---
Yea! Why live and let live, allowing everyone to play to their preferred style, when we can beg Blizzard to force everyone to play the way WE want to!
---
According to your own patch gatekeeping the only patch notes that "mean something" are the 1.9 notes that proof you wrong.    
---
So therefore, you've managed to argue yourself into a corner. You'll either have to be a hypocrite and argue that the alpha/beta notes are now valid, or be wrong and admit that the 1.9 disprove your position.    
---
So are you a hypocrite or just wrong?
---
I have a background in mycology. Would that help?

When i was in school, a 40 yo dude came in to pitch an idea to build a social media platform to replace facebook because facebook is littered with 9gag.

The whirlwind icon is a blade with blue after-image...and a ring for some reason.

Just built a new PC a couple of months ago. Its my first build ever that hasnt had a cd/dvd drive of some sort. Prior to this I usually stuck in a blu-ray burner for backing up stuff. The last machine that currently has a blu-ray drive in it is serving as a media center PC.
---
It's comedian Greg Fitzsimmons
---
It's an old Blademaster icon from WC3 that increased his critical strike chance, and it depicts a blade slicing through armor.
---
You seem really out of the loop. Let me help you out here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Udl2kRIb50
---
Here are some quotes from the comments from people who have experienced it on private servers:
---
"On the [redacted] private server world buffs were wiped upon entering a raid for the first month after the Raids release. The first month was also the most fun because you didnt have to waste an hour before raid bothering with world buffs."
---
Keep in mind, thats with there having no are greatly reduced cooldown on turning in things like Onys head, which won't be as possible in classic - meaning you will need to logout to preserve these buffs when you get them. As represented in this quote:
---
The thing is it will actually be worse on classic realms because I’m sure blizzard will have the correct timers on how often the world buffs can be popped. So even longer people’s mains will be logged."
---
For the most part it has tabs and tabs full of Green Hills of Stranglethorn pages and bloodstone ore for STV quests, and as the server ages you'll start to see T1 BoE pieces on there sometimes
---
Maybe have them be an "enchant" that they can only put on their own gear and stack with other enchants? Wait... no changes!
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c1cwnm/wow_classic_horde_guild_recruitment/).
---
Then don't get world buffs you moron. How fucking hard is it to understand? World buffs is going to be in the game whether you like it or not, just fucking deal with it, holy shit.
---
Do you guys don't have printers?
---
It was the xpac that finally killed my interest in retail for good.
---
These look most accurate to what I saw in Vanilla.  Originally warriors were a bit less popular until people realized their strength and scaling into end game.
---
Preserving the buff beyond the timer would be a glitch. Preserving an hours long buff over a week with intended game mechanics is an exploit.
---
But yeah, keep putting words into my mouth, that'll show me. :\^)
---
What about rogues? Versus other classes.
---
Two things about this though; you’re undervaluing Intellect in terms of increasing your mana pool, with spell power stacking I might kill 3-4 mobs before running OOM, quicker than an Int build, but with Int I can last 6-7 mobs before drinking. Time spent between mobs is a huge deal when you’re leveling
---
Second, if you’re going to do any sort of AOE farming, spell power stacks extremely poorly in that regard. Obviously the best choice is get gear with both Int and SP but that’s rare early on, and I’m especially not going to advocate using the AH around level 30-40 for overpriced SP gear when everyone and their mother should be saving gold for their mounts.  I like you listing useful ways of getting the items don’t get me wrong but the benefit of SP early vs stacking eagle gear is minimal if not worse.
---
It's significantly better, but also more risky (lower HP/Mana) and you'll have more downtime.
---
ravenholdt manor was the og class hall and rogues had it first
---
Oh thank god
---
So you want them to keep you alive through this fight, and then be in position, restore their mana, and be ready to heal again in the time it takes you to use taunt?
---
This topic is the wart and cancer.
---
If players want to logout until raid with a world buff that’s their choice. The logical thing is to do it before the raid if you want to keep playing. Players have to adapt to the game not the other way.
---
Your wording is tiresome to read btw. Feels forced.
---
Welcome guy

Loot Council is based on attendance and performance usually.
---
If 6 mages have the world buffs and you don't as the 7th Mage, guess whose not getting geared tonight?
---
Most guilds nowadays use Loot Council too.
---
Also when you're doing dungeons remember to add people to your friends list. If you got along with them obviously! :D
---
Neither, the 1.9 patch notes DO NOT prove there ever was other-city Auction Houses. Only that now they exist and are linked to the main ones.
---
You're interpreting a single sentence as if it's your argument's shield and yet can't find any supporting evidence because it does not exist.
---
Who's "Metroid" (in the saga metroids are a non-humanoid alien creature)?  If it's for Samus, she holds it in her right.
---
Well i said write KEY WORDS to Google, not whole sentence. You have to be fucking kidding me that even the concept of googling with keywords is strange to you. I hope you start now seeing your problem here. The problem just keeps repeating again and again. This proves, once again, that i am right. No links needed.
---
Hunter
---
Do you guys not have clairvoyance?
---
False. Most people knew they could kill bosses without them, and didn’t want to get stuck on the same boss next week because they didn’t have the world-buff carrying them.
---
... that's just botting with more steps
---
It is second least popular horde side.  And thus the 2nd least popular class overall or potentially the least popular class (druids are least on both sides but might combine to be what shamans are) because pallys are a bit higher popularity on alliance side (and historically there's more alliance then horde too).
---
Also quality of life...farming soul shards to summon people.
---
A snowflake infact
---
Unless you work for blizzard- yes, why would you bother getting upset over the inevitable.
---
&gt; Preserving an hours long buff over a week with intended game mechanics is an exploit
---
Having duration freeze when you are not on the character is not an unintended game mechanic.
---
it is possible with some prep and planning, but it is by no means healthy. I wont go that hard either. But speaking from past experiences, resetting your sleep schedule to where you wake up right before the launch, prepping meals, staying away from sugar and caffeine, getting some exercise regularly, consuming plenty of water, nuts and fresh fruit go a long way. Another trick is to do your regular "morning routine" after 24h to trick your body: take a shower, eat, go for a 5min walk outside.
---
Its the only part in history of the game where the entire game mattered.
---
~~Most~~ 0.1%
---
Good idea! When I played vanilla I was REAL young. Highest I got was 41 and on a night elf hunter giving my best to add to the huntard genre! Next thing I remember was catching TBC in the middle a few years later and few years more mature and by then the LFG system for much more robust.
---
I'm not out of the loop. I completely understand how the mechanic works. I'm asking you what omnipotent being is taking control of your peripherals and forcing you to log out to preserve these raids buffs. If you don't like the mechanic and the way that the mechanic requires you to play the game... Don't use it?
---
You don't need buffs until late naxx to be honest
---
You are right about hand of rag going to a dedicated guildy but it's actually not a great pve weapon so it's not like the fury warriors will want it really. It usually goes to ret pallys or shamans cause they want it for pvp. If you put in your work and are a helpful member of the guild there is a chance you will get it
---
The only thing you really have to go out of your way for are the Acidic Walkers, and they aren't that great. A lot of it will also be BIS for a considerable number of levels. The Icefury Wand, Hypnotic Blade, Celestial Orb, and Azure Shoulders won't be replaced until your late 50s/60.
---
We don't want you anyways. 
---
I'll just be off in a corner petting myself
---
“Time costs”
---
Playing classic wow.
---
;D
---
It won't be - if there was zero layering and we had 6 hour queues - do you think the economy would be perfect after 3 days?
---
Blizzard wants people to play on day 1 - this is the necessary evil that has to happen.
---
In vanilla there were just more players so before cross realm bgs all these players were waiting in queues.  Where I'd get insta pop bgs and run the same group back to back.  It was of course easier to win with more practice and less bad players queueing up.
---
Eventually I was in a premade that was promoting HW's.  We won 100% of games against pugs and 90% against premades.  Only if we hit the GM premade on the other side did the game go 50/50.
---
There are no bragging rights in being the first to clear MC - since everyone will clear MC very fast once they get there.
---
MC, BWL and ZG (and perhaps also AQ40) will have bragging rights in the form of speedruns.
---
The most frustrating part about this post and the commentors who defend it is that it's super fucking simple to start or join a group that doesn't require world buffs. There were TONS of guilds on private servers that didn't require them. 
---
That's all they have to do. But they want to be 1% performers without putting in 1% effort so they cry and bitch in the hopes that Blizzard will cater to them, and force their preferred playstyle onto everyone.
---
Hmm they tied to booty bay? 
---
K great - answered the concern. Thanks for giving them additional infomation.
---
Druid. Jack of all trades for sure, but I'd hate to be a master of none.
---
Sounds plebeian
---
Nice Avenging wrath :D nice vanilla wow bruh :D
---
World buffs were available for us in raids in vanilla. Even low-tier guilds would go into LBRS to mind control a Spellbinder and get their fire resist buff for MC/Ony. If anything, removing world buffs from raids would not make for a truer experience because that's not how things worked in vanilla.
---
This video is describing a problem that did not exist in Classic. Even the guy from D&amp;T guy said that top-end guilds did not obsessively farm up world buffs.
---
And I still maintain the video contradicts itself too much. They narrator claims that world buffs trivialize content, but then says that if the raid wipes then it was all wasted effort, which means the world buffs never actually trivialized the content. Clearly, top-end guilds in Classic knew these world buffs existed, tried them out several times, and ultimately concluded that the effort was simply not worth it.
---
People who played on private servers may need to take their experiences with a grain of salt. They're approximations of 1.12 behavior, and the fact that there is such a large discrepancy in mob difficulty between Classic and Private shows that those experiences are not good measurements.
---
It thematically fits well with the Undead profession.
---
It's almost like the people who played on private servers for years have been drowned out by newcomers who know nothing about Vanilla.
---
No it wasn’t. We had 4H on farm in Vanilla and the only boss we ever popped word buffs for was Loatheb, but even that was overkill.
---
I remember being a god at the high level of a bracket and then a scrub after dinging. Like grade school all over again.
---
Havent seen anyone say a dummy thicc 2hand wielding enhance shaman... hmm
---
Rolling rogue will never be rare.. however you can roll a female dwarf rogue .. and THAT will be rare. Go get em
---
I don't like private servers, and so thus I am practicing my leveling route with the exact data that we will be playing launch with.
---
Again, patch 0.8 is irrelevant. It was four and a half months before the game was publicly available. Did I really need to specify *find me a source in the live game...*? Idiot.
---
Enh shammy is the most fun class to level. Unstoppable force is also good till you get the rag hammer. I suggest resto pve till u get the hammer. And /gquit and enjoy pvp lol
---
2-handers are fun and hit hard, but another popular option is a super fast dagger + shield (for leveling, not for end game). The idea being that the shield gives you some protection against the dreaded "I pulled 2 mobs so I guess I'm dead" element of vanilla, and you're relying on flametongue procs and searing totem for damage, so a fast dagger gives you the most of those. 
---
I leveled that way to \~45 a while back and it did indeed feel very safe, where a 2-hander would be a little more risky.
---
Well, it's hard to find stuff when you don't know what you're looking for, and as you claim you do know what i'm supposed to look for i came here humbly asking for help.
---
If you honestly think "inability to provide citations" proves you right, I'm not sure what to tell you.
---
Shaman because I'm Alliance for life.
---
I know he has records and everything, but aimed shot at 57 seems not so optimal. I would beeline down to bestial wrath, pick up aimed and then go back through the pet tree.
---
Wahey, another streamer thread, another downvote button to click. What a time to be alive.
---
I'll put my neck on the line and say that'll get removed. But if not then I will be bitterly disappointed as stv is a huge hub for wpvp.
---
Yeah you give up ability to AOE for 15% chance of increasing crit chance. Sure against single mobs it increases DPS and DPM, but but are way lower compared to AOE anyway.
---
The cool part is that no one cares and anyone with a brain can google and wiki any item to see it’s uses.
---
How’s it feel to be normal?
---
Players who cared about their DPS so badly usually found themselves BoP’ed or DI’ed mid-fight. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Oom. Hey tank, Oom. OOM. I'M OUT OF MANA YOU TIT STOP PULLING OR I'LL MAKE YOU REGRET IT SHZJXNCOCJDN
---
Nice editing above to remove your mistakes/hypocrisy. Unsurprised. You don't strike me as someone who stands by their words. I'll make sure to quote you from now on.
---
Hmm wonder why
---
I much prefer slower paced dungeons with lots of precise CC execution. That's how I like my MMORPG's. Idk why everyone wants to turn WoW into a Diablo 3 Action RPG. It's really frustrating to me. Can't wait for classic.
---
Sometimes they kill you and sometimes they just try...
---
Sure it does. Elwynn Forest when empty you will do every quest.
---
Elwynn Forest when it'll take 2 hours to do the Defias item quest, the Kobold item quest, you are probably skipping those. That impacts your XP, and levels increase when you're eligible for quests. You need to route how to make up for that XP loss.
---
You don't even need any version of the game, you just need to sub.
---
Yeah, they were a thing even through TBC.
---
Things are very balanced I'd say considering the roles each class plays. If you consider balance "dps meters' then this is the wrong game.
---
yep yep yep
---
Yeah totally agree with you regards the price, but doing it my way is all on my own terms and if...big if I find the time. I can farm SFK for weapons on my own main, and can then run the alt through the DMs also on my terms &amp; time. 
---
As said, I want to have 2 chars to 60 by this point, and would need a good supply of gold! So prob not gonna be possible within the 6-9mths of playing for me.
---
Damn, I didn't know they had in-game voice in the beta. Not that using discord is a big hassle, but for pick-up groups its great.
---
So it was meaningless, until you used the 0.9 patch notes below, and then proof? Then you edited your reply to remove your claim that the 0.8 patch notes were wrong.
---
Lmaooo this is horrendous
---
You still have to pick the talents you want and plan it in advance (as most players do anyway). I assume this is intended for someone who's going to respec a lot, for example from pve to pvp which can be tedious sometimes and lead to mistakes.
---
&gt; Would this spec be fine for healing dungeons to farm pre raid BIS?
---
He's only doing dungeons. It's a waste of money to be drinking mana pots in combat all the time, wtf.
---
Wait why is this dragon flying? Do they fly around before spawn? I have never ever seen this before
---
Definitely quote me. It's the only time you'll ever be correct.
---
They would need to release this in reaitl not classic, and if they did it limit it to guild housing, like make guild halls so to speak like they did class halls. And you can make it a ridiculous amount like 5 milloon so guilds would have to farm together to get it. In classic it would just make the areas feel empty. In retail the areas are already empty so it wouldn't hurt.i
---
Also worth to mention. BfA is the 8th version of wow.
---
\*buff\*
---
Sure, go ahead and do that for every item in your bags. I'll be sure to not wait.
---
Sounds like a personal problem
---
Yes. The same way you can skip The End fight in MGS3 with an exploit by not playing. It's intended that if you wait 1 week The End dies of old age and you skip the fight. However, you can change the clock on your PS2 forward 1 week to get the same result. This is an exploit. It uses intended mechanics in unintended ways for some unintended advantage.
---
So I'll say it a third time since smoothbrain pserver kids have a hard time picking this up. MMOs are more than their mechanics. In the MGS3 example, waiting a week and not playing is fine. MGS3 is a linear game with completely linear content and if you invest the time into the game you'll eventually get the same result.
---
MMOs are not this same experience. Taking a week break from an MMO can have far-reaching effects in terms of opportunity cost. Missing out on gathering, grinding, or market fluctuation. Guilds putting pressure on their raiders to buff-save creates a host of negative effects for that player's play experience that *require* leveling at least one alt to 60 to circumvent - potentially an alt of the same class.
---
Then play with your guild and friends who know you.
---
If you have the choice of inviting a mage or an oomkin as a group leader of course you will take the mage.
---
Like none of you have ever gotten mad at a loss or mad in general at a video game.
---
Please. Pfffft.
---
I, though, find his misery enjoyable :)
---
In this case you're just saving yourself a bunch of alt tabbing to check the spec you are already planned on a talent calculator.
---
It's not like it plans that spec for you.  You either decided on it on your own or you checked someone's cookie cutter build.  Both of which are completely viable things you did in vanilla (planning with talent calcs).  Simply removing the alt tabbing or chance to ruin a point by accident are certainly not going to be QOL that ruins the game.
---
There's addons in classic that are much more game changing that people still love.  I mean does auctioneer ruin the game just because it's a way better version the the auction house?  Maybe some think it does but most of us think it's a great tool to boost your wow economics.
---
I didn't remove anything from the post. I just added to it. Before it said:

&gt; Pre-release patch notes of Alpha and Beta builds mean nothing.

And it still does. Because they don't.

ok bb im coming to you

Profession: Undead
---
If the melee range isn’t correct then yeah it should be ‘fixed’
---
If he’s talking about the hunter dead zone (which is what I thought initially) then hell no, hunters were never able to shoot in melee range. (I get what he meant now)
---
But are you really going to call me dumb as fuck for him not explaining it correctly? His bad but I’m dumb? What the hell man.
---
Oh yeah, it got so bad I had to disable the subreddit style.
---
Did you just ignore every other word of my comment? People didn’t bother wasting time going to get the ZG buff and shit.
---
I would not worry to much about streamers. If you can avoid a server with them on, great. They have followings, and play more than any of us will be able to (most likely).. but I wouldn’t let that change what you choose. Play what you want or you’ll regret it. Just hope for the best server balance you can and enjoy as much as you can.
---
On the part of asmon. I am pretty sure his best friend or friends play paladin. Doubt he would just start playing something else. But who knows. I
---
That wouldve been a good idea 5 years ago
---
Thank you for the editorial advice; I'm sorry you "felt forced" to read it all and even leave a comment.
---
Druids. I'll just play the real thing thanks, not the knockoffs.
---
Warrior. I'll play it in other xaqcs but in Vanilla they are too over played to be remotely interesting to me.
---
Paladin. Played it to Naxx in Vanilla. It can stay in my memories.
---
If someone speaks to you in English with the wrong words you don’t think “oh hey I’m the problem!”
---
Came here to say this. Makes me sad to see unhappy pets :(
---
You can get tinkerers sword from maraudon which is better than the dagger. Also witchblade from strat or scholo I don’t remember is better
---
Why would someone keep doing something they don't like?  This is Classic, not Retail...
---
I'm in the beta and now I remember how boring AV was and why I used to just move my character every 15 mins to farm honor.
---
&gt; Will Arcane Explosion have a casting time or is it instant cast on launch?
---
Instant Cast
---
&gt; Also, will the rolling ignite mechanics be in play?
---
&gt; Also, in case any old friends see this: I was in an Alliance guild named Adventuring Fools on the PvE realm Malfurion. Please message me if you see this!!

&gt;Pre-release patch notes of Alpha and Beta builds mean nothing. They removed those auctioneers in the next pre-patch (0.9):

&gt;&gt; Auction houses/Auctioneers will now exist only in Ironforge, Orgrimmar, and Booty Bay.
---
&gt;Get fucked.
---
No contradiction there.
---
Why are u russian

I highly doubt they would word it 
---
\*will now share the same pool\*

if the only thing they did was add more auction houses. The title of the very section I linked is even called \*\* 
---
### Linked Auction Houses**
---
I like to have power over life and death of a killing machine, making it a unstoppable monster.
---
What kind of fucked up loot council are you used to using?
---
If someone puts in more effort to the raid than someone else they are carrying them, yes. It's not about the difficulty of the raid.
---
Well nobody played warriors because "NEED A TANK. YOU'RE A WARRIOR? YOU TANK!" and like you said, they only became popular when people realized how good their DPS was. 
---
There is one thing in classic concerning dungeons and raids and it's just like it was 15 years ago--nobody wants to talk or heal, ever. 
---
In retail there are tanks and healers everywhere, for whatever reason. 
---
But in classic you'll have a whole party full of warriors and priests saying "need tank and heals!" It's one thing I'm not looking forward to.
---
As someone who enjoys a lot of older games with dwindling or very small communities, let me give you some advice. The largest communities don't want to turn people away, and for the smallest its catastrophic. 
---
I hope that this entire topic is super overblown, and there is certainly a chance for that. The thing is, if I am right and the private server meta comes to classic, it's going to drive away a LOT of people which is bad for everyone, including the Pepega's like yourself. You are proving my point:
---
&lt;If you don't like the mechanic and the way that the mechanic requires you to play the game... Don't use it?
---
If you don't like it, leave. Yeah, many people will - and that's gonna be really unfortunate. You can say something like "that could be expanded to a lot of vanilla mechanics" but the reality is that world buffs really werent abused in classic as the level of tryhard then and now is not the same. 
---
Also, the biggest reason I am against world buffs in raids is because of the aspect of being forced to logout. That is trash design with literally 0 upsides. There are a lot of bad designs in vanilla, but most you can at least argue come with a positive (and the positive is generally speaking, what people are trying to relive) - IE no dungeon finder forcing you to make friends organically.
---
Geared undead Warlocks/Shadow priests would be the worst for me.
---
That or the Dwarf arms warrior with Ashkandi that used to hunt me and my mates in Searing Gorge 1v3 and destroy us.
---
I mean you can’t really know if you like a class or not until you get to 20/30/40. Even getting to lvl 20 takes a lot of time. Time wasted if you don’t like the class. And then you have to start over, do the exact same quests all over again...
---
Wpn skill isn't very important on rogues, its 1-2% dps boost compared to the 10% on warriors.  Also race doesn't play a factor for dagger rogue dps.
---
The Gurubashi Arena was just a chest in the middle of a PvP area. It's such a simple thing but it makes for some nice emergent gameplay. That's the sort of thing that's healthy for an MMO.
---
Then find the patch notes where they were added back in without being linked. Or a screenshot of the auctioneers before patch 1.9. Or a database of their existence before patch 1.9. Or any news article for patch 1.9 that says the existing auctioneers are now linked.
---
You can't.
---
That allows the tank to make decisions though.
---
I believe internals were the go to between the two. Doomguards were a lot more work to summon
---
The beauty of Vanilla is that there are reasons to play every spec and it's not just a one dimensional boring reason like it is good dps.
---
If you want to be special and meme around, play oomkin, if you want to perform well in raids play a mage, if you want to delete people in PvP with insane burst play ele shaman, if you want to win 1v1s play spriest.
---
Hybrid tax has to exist, you can't have a class that can heal do as much dps as a class that can't heal. That makes zero sense.
---
&gt; World buffs were available for us in raids in vanilla. Even low-tier guilds would go into LBRS to mind control a Spellbinder and get their fire resist buff for MC/Ony.
---
I'm fine with this, it doesn't require me to logout to optimize performance.
---
At level 60 will human sword+mace racial matter in pvp?
---
I’ve gotten mad before lmao. The fucking table vibrated. He’s pretty chill from what I’ve seen for the most part too. Would suck if he was in there 10hs. I think he streamed like 18 or something the day AV was announced
---
That’s not true at all. If that person misses a raid, does the whole thing go tits up? No, it literally makes no difference.
---
Yes we already have concensus that many things are hard for you so i know that. I tried to help and give advice but it is difficult to help if even the most simple advice like using keywords in Google appears to be too difficult. With your reading comprehension skills how am i supposed to help you? Sending links, citations or writing to you doesn't help because you don't understand what you read. So again, it would take minimun months for me to educate you on the level that this discussion would be understandable to you. It is not my job to educate you (unless you start paying me).
---
Because it was bullshit revisionism.
---
quite literally are though and there's other guilds out there
---
Lol. Are you intentionally being hyper-literal because it's the only leg you have to stand on or are you just this way normally?
---
Could be something like 
---
/script Dismount()
---
/cast frost nova
---
Even as support paladins are boring.
---
only reason I cite the guild I was in is because people keep claiming hardcore guilds used these tactics all the time. They didn't. It's cancer design, but keep defending it I guess, sperg.
---
&gt;meaningfulusername91
---
Thank you!
---
Loot council. Pass. 
---
The dkp system that we used to run in vanilla was that if you had the points for something then you could be forced to take it if no one else wanted it and it was an upgrade for you. Oh and we didn't do a bidding system, each item had a set value and if 2 people wanted it the one with the most points got it. Worked pretty well for us. Up until Naxx killed the guild. :)
---
It really was both.  These types of SS are harder to come by.  Mixing in hilarious or fun ones was good.  But IMO op's post is more quality showcasing the WoW world and those are the ones I preferred.  But a mix was great so we didn't get bored of them.
---
That point was made 5 seconds into the video. I think he's accusing you of not watching the rest or being unable to comprehend the argument. I concur with him.
---
Hunter and mages...I like to be close up my target, ranged in general feels weak to me.
---
I feel bad for the players who rush into it and plan on playing a meme spec.. its all fun and games when you roll a Pally to 60 to be Ret on purpose. Its another thing when you roll it completely unsuspecting!
---
I still had your post open in another tab. It used to read:   
---
&gt; Pre-release patch notes of Alpha and Beta builds the patch notes were often wrong, they mean nothing.    
---
Nice editing though.
---
Would you say it’s better for aoe grinding or single target? I’m going a single target build as I think there will be more competition for mobs on launch
---
Agreed. But maybe as time went on pictures strayed away from players to environment as we got a different love for the game we began to miss.

---
It's not hyper literal they mean two completely different things and there's absolutely no way to infer that you perhaps didn't mean it one way over the other.
---
It's not the only leg I have to stand on either, suspending the buff timer when you log out **is not unintended** as you claim. What's more, having those buffs in raids is **also not unintended** what this means is, you don't have anything. It's not an exploit.
---
Hmm interesting. I’ll have to look up horde specific drops so I know what to save for this AH. Thank you
---
What did you raid in Vanilla?
---
Priests are mana hungry and I’m not being a bastard I’m being realistic. I can’t heal without mana that’s a fact. 
---
 at 10-20% it’s a wast. 
---
Wast of my time as I will run OOM 
---
Wast of groups time as we will all die and have to spend 15m corpse running.  
---
Since bandaging is not going to cut it.  
---
If a tank does that then I got two option 
---
1# wait the longest drinking hoping I get enough mana to make it. 
---
2# pulling the plug and run off wiping group.  
---
It’s a judgment call and a split second decision as you have to decide keep drinking or run off.  
---
Tank spec( yes arms warriors sometimes tank),
---
My mana, 
---
Dps with healing capabilities will dictate my decision.  
---
Even A Soulstone would make me commit 100% of the time.  
---
It’s not very much different from a paladin tossing a DI on you to save time.   It’s definitely not different then a tank teaching a dps to stay on his side of the threat table by letting him die a few times.  
---
I was definitely not bad at the game but don’t worry I don’t play in NA servers so you don’t have to care.  
---
Frame it nice to the group early and it was 0 issues. 
---
“ Hello I’m your friendly healer for this run, please pay attention to my Mana bar(blue bar below my name in interface). If this bar is below 50% and you pull a new group you might cause a wipe. If to low I will run off and shadow meld to save us a corps run.  Now let’s help each other and make this a swift and good run.”  
---
Frame it right and no one complains.
---
The classes that interests me the least are mage &amp; paladin. One of often used as a vendor machine and the other has to rebuff people every 5 minutes.
---
&gt; On the private server I've played, my absolute favorite time of raiding was the first month of content release, where world buffs was disabled for that particular raid. It evens the playing field so to speak.
---
this is the sort of mentality that ruined WoW stuff isn't fair or even that is what makes it fun. it feels like you doing that isn't intended and geting a unique benefit. it is the spike in power you aren't otherwise going to see.
---
Not sure where you're getting your numbers, but rogue damage is a huge % auto attacks, weapon skill is absolutely a vital and huge part of your DMG if you're playing any kind of melee
---
I think I played in Season 9.. I played a Holy Paladin and I remember Arena games went from fast to long and drawn out af.
---
This guys nuts, I had so much fun as a battle healer. You can keep your seals up on the boss, constantly regen mana with Insight, perform mechanics for melee groups. All while being the main tank healer
---
Oh, god, not this "while leveling" shit again...  Classic WoW begins at 1.  The treadmill begins at 60.
---
All specs are viable just not in a one dimensional way retail players expect them to be viable.
---
Shadow priest is viable because it's good for 1v1s. SL lock, same thing.
---
Elemental shaman is good burst damage, fun for pvp.
---
Enhancement shaman is good if you want RNG procs that sometimes one-shot people.
---
Ret paladin, good for pvp, it's an RP meme thing, if that's what you want.
---
If you want to be a clown / be special, go for balance druid.
---
Nope. Now you're just lying. 
---
http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/world-of-warcraft/678633p1.html
---
Keep thinking you're right about unlinked AH's ever existing in the Live game you piece of shit.
---
Every game can be an esport as long as some people want to compete and others want to watch them compete. The problem is that a healty esport scene can only be grown from the bottom, as a movement among players, not from the top as another checkmark in some manager's portfolio. Remember the recent Horde PvP tournament? It probably had more viewers then all recent Arena tournaments. The problem is that Blizzard during the majority of its history stomped on any possibility of grassroot esport movement.
---
Dwarf paladin. That thing comes running with a fucking sword and one shots you, you go see the log and then you understand that "it" did a overkill of 9k damage.
---
Never got that. 
---
Shaman is the best. You are the ultimate five man support class, you have this awesome arsenal of spells and then you get a shitload of utility through totems as well.
---
Dropping totems for people feels like a *privilege*.
---
Wasn’t season 3 straight up the Glaive meta?
---
Its release date.
---
"If you don't like it, leave." See, that's improper premise. I said if you don't like the mechanic then don't use it. Some people prefer Life stealing over AGI enchants despite losing DPS. You are not being forced to use that mechanic. Raids CAN BE DONE without using worlds buffs, or flasks, or pots, or full Fury Warrior teams.
---
As for the world buiff mechanic itself. Blizz never intended for people to use them in the way that they are abused on private servers, hence why they function in the way that they do. If you, as a player, wish to preserve these buffs you get to endure a very punishing mechanic... you can't play the game on that character. Seems pretty balanced considering that you're trying to stack world buffs in order to complete content "faster" don't you think?
---
&gt; Then if we wiped or people got killed by the horde trying to get to the raid it would cause tons of drama and was super toxic. Caused a bunch of people to always get mad at each other and people to quit etc.
---
that is a good thing, drives pvp.
---
most of the large scale pvp fights happens because people want to wipe other guilds world buffs off.
---
Paladin without a doubt. Boring as hell as a healer, boring as hell as DPS and boring as hell as a tank. As a class they feel the most unfinished and uninteractive. Too much of their support comes from passive blessings and auras.
---
&gt;Two things about this though; you’re undervaluing Intellect in terms of increasing your mana pool, with spell power stacking I might kill 3-4 mobs before running OOM, quicker than an Int build, but with Int I can last 6-7 mobs before drinking. Time spent between mobs is a huge deal when you’re leveling
---
Spell power increases your damage per mana far more than Intellect does. So not only does it help you kill faster but it also allows you to use fewer spells doing it. You also don't need to spend as much time on the ground drinking because your mana pool is lower. You're also greatly overvaluing how much Intellect contributes to how many spells you can cast. At lvl 40 it takes 10 intellect to add a single extra cast of Frostbolt. Much of this gear also has +intellect on it, so you're unlikely to be able to cast more than 3 extra frostbolts. Considering you will do 30-40% extra damage per frostbolt you end up being able to do more damage before you go OOM than you would stacking Intellect.
---
&gt;Second, if you’re going to do any sort of AOE farming, spell power stacks extremely poorly in that regard.
---
Yes, if you want to AoE farm to 60 you shouldn't get spell power.
---
&gt;and I’m especially not going to advocate using the AH around level 30-40 for overpriced SP gear when everyone and their mother should be saving gold for their mounts.
---
If you actually look at the gear on the list you will see most of the crafted stuff actually requires very little as far as mats go. If you're a tailor you're probably spamming Azure Silk gear to level anyway. Consequently it goes for very low prices. The Dreamweave set are the only pieces of gear that require a semi-rare item.
---
You also don't even have to get most of the stuff on this list since of Frozen Wrath greens are almost always better.
---
God I fucking hate tanks like that. I have started explicitly asking for relaxed and chill runs when I’m healing. Let’s have fun in the dungeon and not try desperately to get out of it as fast as possible.
---
If you’re looking for a frantic pace you can find another dang healer.
---
No that would clearly be (like you said) a bug. There is a difference between bugs and emergent gameplay/strategies/ect. Wall jumping behind WSG is a bug, using Blessing of Sacrifice to break CC is an emergent strategy. And trying to ad hoc squash every new strategy, build, meta, is a fools errand.
---
Besides that distinction though, I'm not even convinced that using raid wide buffs on raids to help clear raids, is unintended gameplay in the first place...
---
And end up having to go back to town to spam “LF healer” for over an hour? Remember, the meeting stones can’t summon people, so unless there’s a warlock in your group, kicking a tank/healer can result in the entire run falling apart when people get impatient and leave.
---
thats pure dog shit pvp was poppin throughout MoP and even WoD to an extent

Resorting to lies to detract from the fact you lost the actual argument.
---
Not really, rogue don’t have crippling poison at 19. Hunters dominate them
---
AV has always been the least popular bg. And yes, there are many who mainly play for PvP and bgs are the main realistic long term PvP option.
---
Its usually whoever gets the opener.  Hunter wins if you start it max range, mage wins if you dont have any engineering tricks and feign trap to get back to range.
---
Someone putting in more effort and producing better results means they are carrying you. This is the second explanation of the word carrying in this context.
---
Any version of Alterac Valley is boring after a while
---
I remember my vanilla wow schedule, it was pretty much a second job. Nowadays I want to spend time with my son and then do housework before I play, so classic will be firmly in the realm of hobby for me, it might even take me over a year to get to 60.

Horde fo' sho'

Exactly lol MS will outscale until 700 unbuffed ap then you can swap to full fury and use BT.

Are you sure it shouldn't be a dead horse that he's beating in that pic..?

No problemo. I don't main healer anymore but i have healed on 3 different private servers.

No, you asserted this, because it's the only way for you to not seem retarded after making outrageous claims.
---
&gt;  tried to help and give advice but it is difficult to help if even the most simple advice like using keywords in Google appears to be too difficult.

it's not like pugs back then were filled with rational people. But thanks for reminding me why it's so important to roll a warlock for classic
---
They don't have that QOL either, TP mostly benefit others, and they have to carry and farm soulshards. But Gear Style should be 10/4 at least.
---
Time is dependent on how try hard you want to be.  If you just wanted to get a few BiS pieces and the BiS ranged weapon you’ll be fine and still wreck as a hunter.  Arena trinket and fishing events with DM enchants is a different story all together.
---
Umm.. no..

"Should" is not equal "will be". Depends on the water quality which on the water level breakpoints and 45+ will be a lot less efficient.

I don't think anyone who has out grown their edgy phase is gonna roll a rogue.

Watch your tongue.
---
Implication is the key word. In practice? You new? Have you tanked? Have you tanked and had a healer with full mana, and you pull? Then find out healer was AFK smoking a cigarette? You ask the healer every pull. Stop being High and Mighty.
---
It's part of the AQ40 questline for the scepter.  You have to defend Remulos from Eranikus' attack but not kill Eranikus so you can talk to a neutral Eranikus after Tyrande converts him (you fight off Eranikus but if you kill him you fail).  It's a combat on Nighthaven in Moonglade that you proc as part of the quest chain for the Green Shard piece of AQ40 scepter quest.  Blue shard is from Azuregos and red is from Vaelastrasz.

Dude I am obsessed with Rythym bot ATM.. there is no background silence because everyone in the room is listening to music I probably queued up.

All my favourite bands are Australian and quite new, so I get a real kick queuing up say Nonagon Infinity - King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard while we BG.
---
lol you're getting downvoted for RPing
---
This sub is doomed..
---
I think its a nice boost to damage, but there are arguably better warrior PvP racials.
---
Blizzard clearly thought they were mistaken, that's why they removed the Auctioneers one pre-release patch after adding them.
---
The only thing that looks bad here is your disregard for evidence. It proves you're an idiot.
---
I love it
---
Yeah definitely the former. ~90% of best stats is good enough for me
---
the buffs very much intended to be used this way. the idea being a sort of soft lowering if diffculity as the raids went on so more and more people cleared. the only thing is that they didn't consider people getting them all every week which is a very typical classic design thing of not knowing what the other hand dose. if this had been somthing every guild did in classic it would have been limited to one be allowed one at a time.
---
the main reason this is clearly intended is that vanilla devs have said as much and they kept it in TBC with Blessing of A'dal world buff that worked in raids.
---
It's the ONLY thing available, it's fun for a bit but it was only ever something done once or twice a week as its s real slog of a bg. I've only done 1 all weekend, I have queued a couple of times but long queue times put me off.  It's a shame o couldn't take the level 58 chars anywhere to try out specs etc, that would have been a better use of my weekend
---
As in Eranikus from Sunken Temple? Cool!
---
I am mostly unfamiliar with the AQ event from Vanilla retail (never hit 60 back then - I just know we collected resources to open the gates). Would anybody mind explaining why dream boi was out of his dungeon?
---
We should seceded from the union and fight for our independence.
---
SHOULD doesn’t mean squat. I am overly careful because it is my experience. Full mana healer is AFK smoking a cigarette or eating dinner because mom yelled at him. You ask the healer if they are ready. The one time they aren’t ready, you do a Corpse Run.
---
from what I remember, they were 10-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59 and 60

You generally can't just splice sandbox concepts into a themepark MMO. It has to be designed for them from the ground up.
---
&gt; I said if you don't like the mechanic then don't use it.
---
So obviously, I won't. However, **if** the toxic Pserver community gets its way, even casual guilds will require it. At that point it's use the mechanic or quit, yes? Have a little foresight here.
---
Is anyone having immense problems trying to keep the old crew back together?
---
I have people dead set on Alliance and dead set on horde, then like 75% of the rest of the guild not caring which side we roll.
---
All specs being viable does not make the game better. Look at retail
---
It's temporary mate... what does it matter after the initial month? I'd rather this to splintered ghost town servers with far more servers in a battlegroup.
---
Think beyond the launch....
---
Yes you do. You just not have had cigarette smokers/kids healing you. I’ve done so many corpse runs from AFK healers, that this is how I Tank now. Hasn’t failed me. Cry me a river if it’s taking too long. Wipes take longer.

For the AQ 40 even you needed to get three dragon shards Blue, Green, Red.
---
Eranikus held the red shard.  You start this even by going to AQ 40 and dealing with the Shade of Eranikus and Malfurion pushes the quest further so you end up in Nighthaven in Moonglade and defend Remulos from Eranikus' attack.  However you need to speak to Eranikus so you can't kill him.  Evenutlaly Tyrande converts Eranikus to neutral which then progresses the quest where you're seeking his Green shard.
---
Blue shard required you to speak to a neutral Azuregos and Red shard you spoke to Vaelastrasz.
---
The whole quest is a fantastic thing to learn about.  I recommend Madseason's video on it.
---
not at first, i think they changed it pretty quickly though. originally the 10's were the top of the bracket - 21-30, 31-40, etc.
---
Where now, is the horse and the rider ?
---
Damn, I love that. "Fk these easy mode paladins and warlocks; watch me tank and carry my dungeons". 
---
Classic will be big because many games don't have this anymore.
---
Without the STVietnam, mount grind and running to scarlet monastery grind memories would be different. Still in raids you would think "fk these guys got mounts for free and know nothing"
---
Yeah you're right, I put the wrong link.

Beyond that, there's really very little room to discuss anything. If you want to change something, **\#NoChanges** (which I agree with by the way). If you don't want to change anything, why even start a topic? We already know what the game will look like.
---
Lol. True...
---
Outside of the use of slippery slope that you seem to be against... Elite/Hardcore/Dedicated groups requirements for raids don't extend to the majority of the population. On retail right now casual guilds don't require flasks, enchants, BIS, Specs.... any of that. Sure, some do ask that you try to be the best that you can be, but unless your guild is trying to really push content or something.... these things just aren't required.
---
The "toxic pserver" community can try and force this meta all they want, my guild will not require these of any raider. Fights are thinly veiled gear checks and trivial mechanics at best in vanilla. Asking people to dedicate hours of their life to clear content that doesn't require that kind of investment is stupid and the community will realize that just as they have in retail and through every iteration of this game.
---
Priest and druid. Priests just dont seem very fun. Healing in general. Would rather heal on a pally and get that sweet pally gear. And druid would be cool to play a bear, but I feel like I would much rather tank on a warrior.
---
Sugar crusted fish feast 10% hp + mana every second overwrites well fed for a 20 verse but it's the fastest healing food in game.
---
200g is quite easier to acquire really...
---
Yes they were. Some people are REALLY casual WoW players.
---
Everyone is different and bad in their own way. Some healers are OCD about full mana, some use way too much, some smoke a cigarette every 5 minutes, some are up past their bedtime. 
---
You need to ask the healer. Assuming and being overconfident will get you wiped, sooner or later. Just because it LOOKS like they have enough mana, doesn’t mean they think so/are ready.
---
Calm down nerd
---
Which is stupid, Artifacts in Legion were great. One of the worst things about BFA is getting rid of Artifacts and not replacing their functionality adequately, so some classes are missing core utility/functionality that they were built around.

did you not read the part where i said "i like the idea"?
---
&gt; suspending the buff timer when you log out is not unintended
---
If we're being hyper-literal, then you should note that I never made this specific claim. You're making assumptions about what I've typed - hence words into mouth.
---
 &gt; What's more, having those buffs in raids is also not unintended what this means is, you don't have anything. 
---
For a fourth time, the exploit isn't having the buff. Getting the buff 20 minutes before your raid because another guild cleared it is fine. Exploits are literally defined as *intended mechanics* created *unintended results*. The unintended result in this case is the social aspect surrounding keeping the buffs at any cost. The exploit is when a guild pressures its raiders to not play the characters they want to play to retain a buff. The intended outcome of a few of these buffs, besides the buffs themselves, are faction pride because the more people clear Ony/BWL the more buffs your faction get. When the buffs are a burden because it means you get yelled at if you don't log out when you're in the mood to grind mats, you've created unintended outcomes. Therefor preserving the buff over a week via logging out is an exploit. ***Logging out and not playing the game shouldn't give you a leg up over another player who chose not to log out for a week.***
---
I don't know how much clearer I can be about this. MMOs are social games. The social aspect is part of the fabric of the game. Social consequences are also a factor when we consider intended and unintended outcomes.

what does realm discord mean?
---
What a desk slam or should I say desk scam.
---
Priest, Paladin are pretty tough to level, I'd avoid them. For a smooth leveling experience I'd chose one of the classes with pets, warlock or hunter, they have a place in raids and pvp and still enjoyable to level.
---
Only in wow I end each sentence with "^^"
---
Warrior I would stay away from.
---
Warlock/Hunter/Mage are all new player friendly. 
---
The former two get a pet, the latter just nukes shit dead.
---
That's because a lot of the stuff people suggest as "qol" isn't "qol"
---
Doesnt seem to work on android :(
---
 One shaft of light that shows the way  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Play mage
---
You'll see a lot of rogues in the 10-19 bracket. 19 priest is probably top healing in that bracket, hunters were great at kiting melee classes, Warriors were great if you had a pocket healer with you. 19 twinks aren't too difficult to gear up (besides getting the fishing hat and buying expensive BoEs) so you could roll two or three as long as you have a friend to run you through DM and WC.
---
I had a 39 shadow priest that would melt faces but would go oom very quickly which spoiled most of the fun. I remember mages dominating in the 30-39 bracket.
---
My favorite would probably have to be my 29 subtlety gnome rogue, could one shot non-twinks with one ambush crit, plus with the boosted engineering skill gnomes get you could use the Goblin Rocket Helmet to charge up the WSG GY and Parachute Cloak to glide down to BS from LM. I had a 29 holy paladin as well, could withstand a lot of damage and healing output was pretty decent.
---
As for the queue times I would imagine 10-19 would be the quickest as you had a lot of people in that leveling range, followed by 20-29 then 30-39.
---
There will be a Discord Server for every realm, probably one for each faction. It will be used for pretty much everything and take the place of in-game chat.
---
To me protection paladins are lesser warriors, holy is not as fun as shaman, and retribution I just think ASHBRINGER each as special as the million others
---
same, ive played free trials many times over the years but now im really gonna try and play it
---
a lot of classics design has major up swings be it things like world buff, whirldwind axe at 30 etc. doing things you aren't meant to do but you do it anyhow and get a huge benefit. the downside however is that if a person dose it and you don't it dosen't feel fair. the same can be said about classics social interactions somtimes they are just great but you also get really shitty situation where a dude ninja loots the bindings.
---
you can't have those just huge massiv upswings without those big downswings
---
Paladin is slow but easy. Priest is pretty good to level with the right spec. Both aren't especially hard.
---
That is exactly what it means.
---
This was posted a few days ago.
---
I have been leaning toward hunter but after watching videos I think A priest healer may be fun! Im torn
---
I’d say screw the perceived ease or difficulty of a class. Narrow your choices down to type (melee, ranged, caster), role (tank, healer, dps) and pick a class fantasy that appeals to you. Have fun with it and don’t be afraid to roll new toons to play around with them. 
---
The current free trial lets you play up to level 20. It’s not classic but it’s close enough to get a feel for the game and classes.
---
Yeah I agree, while i would not mind disabling world buffs in raids for some time, calling it an exploit because it "was not intended to get 40 people to gather them together and use them in such an effective manner" is really stretching the definition of a exploit.  
---
The thing about timers being an exploit because people log out to preserve them is hardly an exploit, every naxx guild killing loatheb would have been called out in vanilla if so.
---
Mage and Priest are the two I’m between currently. Thanks for the advice! I’ve heard that same advice about race before, and I’m going to heed it
---
If you're wondering why no one's watching, it's because you forced YouTube-only and no one wants that shit.

1.12 AV is bad.   
---
Need side quests and big battles.
---
This is solved at high level with Greater Blessings though. And you only have to buff one of each classes in the entire raid every 15 minutes.
---
Sword spec was ridiculous with hand of justice where it would proc off the extra attack, whirlwind and sweeping strike. The proc rate was fixed in 1.12.
---
Whelp ?
---
Why? Im between mage and priest. Any reasoning?
---
Stoked!
---
1.12 AV sucks and is the poster child for why #nochanges is a brain-dead philosophy. AV has so much potential, but the incentives need to be reworked. Ideally Blizz would be willing to keep iterating on this BG rather than just shipping the 1.12 version, which is hands down the worst version of vanilla AV.
---
They also aren’t gaining anything from it.   They have subpar gear, aren’t 60, aren’t really gaining any honor or rep because it’s only for 3 days.  But I mean most people will only play av during about weekends or if they need get the rep for items. Otherwise it’s always going to be the least popular bg.
---
Same same
---
Just something to consider.
---
* Best levelers: druid/ hunter/ warlock
---
* Medium: mage/priest/rogue/shaman
---
* Worst levelers: warrior/ paladin
---
You can heal as enhance for most of the pre 60 dungeons but you will need a set of gear dedicated to it
---
Fights in vanilla were never balanced around groups having every world buff available.
---
You couldn't even get Rallying Cry until a group actually cleared the raid to get the Ony/Nef head. By then, the amount of gear you would have gained from partial raid clears would have done more for your group than the buff itself.
---
I had this experience in Korean beta.
---
I started a priest because I wanted to be a healer so I completely disregarded the shadow tree, I'm so glad my friend played mage and provided me with water so I could actually afford to respec once I noticed that talent.
---
Well your last post starts with "it's hard" so you said it by yourself. Now you don't even understand what you write by yourself? Can't you really see the problems you have? The decent thing to do here is let you learn by yourself. It is the best way. You need to learn that you can't give up in 2 seconds and start asking help straight from randoms. Thats where all these problems you have come from. Sometimes you have to put the effort in learning all by yourself. I already showed you where the path starts but you need to start walking it alone.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_satiation
---
Retails biggest class problem is that are all so similar because they took away class identifying buffs/etc. That wouldn't change with just making certain specs not garbage.
---
So were talking private servers where the resources are abundant compared to vanilla (node spawn rate and it still cost hundreds?  
---
Doubt that will carry over to classic.
---
**Semantic satiation**
---
Semantic satiation (also semantic saturation) is a psychological phenomenon in which repetition causes a word or phrase to temporarily lose meaning for the listener, who then perceives the speech as repeated meaningless sounds. Extended inspection/Over-Analysation in place of repetition also produces the same effect.
---
Might not want to play with those kinds of dingleberries, then.
---
Yeah, it's really fucking shitty. And blocking it with RES doesn't help.
---
/u/iDylo, /u/mr_rosh, and /u/Nooble5 should be fired.
---
Thanks for that! Why are pallys so hard?
---
Cutting edge raiders were getting bleed the fuck out during Legion, myself included. Between the fucked M+ gear system, 54 trait grind, and Tomb of Sargaras's bullshit, followed by a fairly lackluster finish in Antoras a lot of us up and quit. Look at the Alliance raid representation, as of a week ago, only 11 Alliance guilds cleared Shrine. Hardcore WoW is in a huge dip, and one of the factions is fucking collapsing. 
---
I'm still a very competitive video gamer, but I have absoltuely no desire to return to retail WoW mythic raiding. There's no pride to be taken in a game nobody gives a fuck about. Parses are a crapshoot because gear is so RNG it's damn near impossible to get BiS, so there's no even playing field, it's all RNG. I couldnt even compete if I wanted to, I'd be either given a blessing or a curse by my gear RNG. Even winning and getting top 50 parses doesn't particularly feel good, and it hasnt since MoP. Its cool seeing your name on the leaderboard, but when you look at trinkets and see Titanforged Unstable Arcanocrystal next to your name, you know your parse is bullshit because blizzard has a broken gearing system. 
---
I know for a fact I'm not alone, and more guilds have died leading into and following BfA than any other expansion that I've personally played. The guild I was in during Legion fell appart some time between september and december, and the number of current content clears for modern mythic raids is dropping every tier. 
---
If you're talking the 500-1000 hyper invested 10+ year no lifers and the like, yeah, most of them would stay, but I consider myself to be part of that crowd when the game is worth playing.
---
Alright, how do you feel about healing?
---
Typically involves staring at health bars and is a role that a priest would be expected to fill while leveling. Though as far as healers go they have all the tools to make it happen. 
---
Mage is a good first choice, I just got the wife into classic and having tried all the classes (she hated healing), it was the one she connected most with.
---
The problem is that you aren't going to be in a hardcore guild as an oomkin. You can play 60 hours a week, still doesn't matter, you're landing in a casual/meme spec only guild if you play oomkin.
---
I find it insane how people think shitty spec balance is somehow a charm of Classic WoW. It isn't. It only makes the game less interesting because everyone is playing the same shit because you have no choice if you want to be good or in a good guild.
---
The Old Gods
---
Definitely going to try the trial just to get used to the keybinds
---
Classic is a long investment game, so I'm not sure if it's good to pick a race and class based on ease of use and such. No class is so difficult you can't learn it. And many people end up never branching out of the DPS role due to starting out with an accessible option, sometimes it's best to take the bandaid off early.
---
Frankly, your friends should be helping you with this as they know you and can explain some key aspects. When I introduce people to WoW I give them a rundown of their options, and generally people may want to try each class up to level 5-10. I try to get people some practice "tanking" and healing, as well, even if it's just outdoors.
---
Have you played an MMO before? Do you know what the holy trinity is? What kind of character fantasy do you like?
---
Apparently Druid players are insecure as fuck, lol. 
---
Druids, just because someone doesn't want to be you doesn't mean they don't like you. &lt;3
---
Till they see that ugly ass armor. Aside from forsaken female casters, everything looks trash on horde
---
All the reasons
---
I remember when stormwind added auctioneers. It was kinda a big deal.... they did not have a auctioneer in all major cities from the beginning.
---
Ok, should I be on the lookout for that type of gear whenever im questing then I suppose! Or should I also join dungeons as enhancement and see if I can get some off set pieces while dpsing?
---
Healing is fun. 
---
Yes there are 2 healing spells but you will downrank to rank 4 HL so 3 in total with holy shock 4.
---
On a low level healing is as boring as chain casting frostbolt. But to be good healer you'll need to do more. 
---
Per Boss battle I try to optimize...
---
-positioning both for heals and aura + judgementrange
---
-when to use Divine Shield to either ignore a specific boss mechanic.
---
-when to use pots/trinkets etc...
---
-strategic use of LoH for 30% armor buff (pop it 30 sec before pull and drink up to full) =1,5mins of massive armor
---
-tactical use of LoH when tank needs heals now during massive damage phase
---
-keep wisdom or light judgement up
---
-dispell when necessary as paladin has the cheapest dispell that gets everything except curses
---
-BoP to force tank changes or rescue kiters/AOEers/aggro hogs that get into a bad spot 
---
-HoJ stunnable trash mobs to reduce damage taken on tank.
---
Because we are in beta and layering has clearly huge flaws currently, therefore there is a chance for it to get changed before launch and we should fight for it while we can
---
You accidentally the universe
---
I'm bored of it too and I'm in beta and am not a streamer.
---
Call me a min maxer, but I don't want to play in an AV that goes past an hour usually. I just want to do the honor grind. Playing with people who can't coordinate and end up turtling is beyond frustrating.
---
And, as mentioned, it's literally the only thing we can do. We can't level up. You can duel, but still.
---
Yikes...
---
It's not an exploit lol
---
I used cross-factions a long time ago when I transferred items from horde to alliance, and vice-versa.
---
They do nada damage.
---
World buffs never made your raid group wipe-proof. They never trivialized content.
---
If they did, top-end guilds would have farmed them before every raid and the guy from Death &amp; Taxes would have said likewise.
---
My original main was a hunter, still over the years I lost enthusiasm for ranged combat "legion survival is my favorite" also I don't want my raiding to just be 97% aimed shot
---
That makes sense I suppose!
---
You’ll just have to piece it together as you can. Only way you’ll get dungeon heal gear is if the healer doesn’t need it which is unlikely. If you roll on heal gear while dpsing you’ll likely get kicked
---
Thats true! Priest healing is what seems to be most interesting to me so far from researching.
---
This is blatantly false, you learn so much better by taking advice from people who actually know what they're talking about.
---
There's 2 things that go into improving at game, learning what to do and learning what not to do.
---
The best way of learning what to do is imitating better players, the best way of learning what not to do is by playing against better players.
---
The only time where "self learning" is helpful is the best way of going about is once you run out of better players to help guide you.
---
World of WarCraft: ASS
---
I used to do it several years back, it was enjoyable. Kendo is probably fun as well. They are both semi-to full contact weapon fighting sports so share a lot of similarities.
---
Flat increase.
---
I have no clue what the holy trinity is but I like a character that I can kind of replace with myself and feel comfortable aka a human or elf or something like that. I enjoy placing myself in my characters shoes
---
Their damage is low/ almost no damaging active buttons which means "afk" leveling as you dont do much.
---
Priests and mages. Not much into casters I guess.
---
If I press Scourge Strike, I want to do more than 3% of the target's health. Mortal Strike should do more than 10 or 12%.
---
Meanwhile healers get to pop for 25%+ per cast. 
---
The entire system is broken because 1 healer is supposed to match 2 DPS in healing throughput without cooldowns. Healers are WAY too strong, just from a fun perspective. They get to fully negate whatever the fuck you do unless you pop cooldowns, and their mana costs for handing non-CD damage is pretty much negligible.
---
It's almost like there are different people wanting different things.
---
I mean, I’m 25 with a good job, I’m gonna roll rogue because I don’t care for mana and I wanna skip shit sometimes
---
Essentially your auto attack is all there is to do?
---
Is it just me or does it feel like most People here are alliance Players?
---
Warlock because A: I played one in BFA and legion and B: I really don't want to have to farm out soul shards all the time. 
---
Paladin because if I want to DPS I would not be the best and I would be taking gear from warriors who would use it better. Also as healing paladin looks like it either buff bots or spam heal just the tank and has little aoe healing.
---
Hunter sounds pretty bad to me too because of dead zone and the meta that hunters ninja loot weapons from other classes and that just doesn't make me want to play one.
---
I love playing as a rogue, warrior, or mage - but I played each extensively during vanilla and then cata.  I plan to do priest for healing endgame.  Druid looks interesting but I hear they aren't the best as raid heals.  As an alliance specialist,  I havent tried shaman but some of their totems make them interesting.
---
I played the game when it originally came out, and no, it started at 60.
---
You would be mind blown at the amount that are gonna quit just in the level 6-10 zone alone 🤣 
---
Shits no joke.
---
The difference is you know exactly what you are getting into the moment you start playing.
---
If you roll something in retail and it turns out bad you can argue that hey I didn't know it would be like this, but with Classic if you chose to play Ret or Balance or whatever meme spec, you know exactly how strong they are so you have no right to complain. If you wanted to have good dps you could have just picked mage. You didn't and it was your choice.
---
Hybrid tax has to exist to preserve PvP balance. Retadins doing as much damage as a mage makes as much sense as mages being able to heal as much as paladins.
---
Alright.  
---
So i guess it‘s just a bad wording?
---
Few things are more fun than ambushing rogues, turn the tables on them
---
Sure, when you trust the tank.
---
Love the clip - would recommend setting up a noise gate however :)
---
post the 1.10 RAP normalization people who already used the melee dive system opted out of using AiS whenever possible and instead went for 4 auto: 3 melee dives. (2 raptors 1 generic white hit, then you had to delay one melee hit into the next rotation due to misalignment of the swingtimers)
---
As the system doesn't use the AiS cooldown it was back to the pre 1.5 arcane shot usage and with that even more raid consumables as you get both str/melee ap stuff and spell boosting stuff
---
(as lil history lesson. Pre 1.5 AiS cast time was 3 sec + ranged weapon speed - unmodified by ranged attack speed. So up till 1.5 AiS usage was really bad for everything that was not a PvP or solo PvE opener. It blocked 2-3 auto shots depending on how bad people timed the cast)
---
Stings in 40 are a no go and were always a no go in good guilds aside from desperate 'more dots' pre enrage scenarios ... and even then they were a bad choice lol
---
anyway
---
The benefits were (aside from the better overall dmg) that it frees you from the 10 sec rotation clutch system.  The only things to keep an eye out was to not clip auto shots with arcane and to keep the multishot animation timer in mind. (multi has a 0,5 - pre ranged haste - animation time so it can delay auto shots even more than other abilities when it is poorly timed)
---
(adding this as obvious, but since people are always toxic about the melee dive system I ought to add that this is only applicable in raid environments as they would provide you with enough melee AP buffs to make it worthwhile)
---
you still spec into AiS for situations when you had to stay at a distance  due to stuff like low raid HP, our your own HP dropping to play it safe for 1-2 10 sec rotations to give your supports time to top you up again or for certain boss phases (heigan, sons, gluth as ally, veno p1, theka p2 ayam p1)
---
But alas the typical 'me bad hunter, me sit on 41y auto shot afk' players are going to tear my apart for mentioning the melee dive system
---
We all decided to roll alliance for a whole new experience. We've been horde since the beginning so its gonna be weird for sure lol.
---
Indeed, writing plugins/addons/whatever is such a great way of getting your feet wet since you can actually achieve meaningful things with very little work.
---
Seems like an even split for me tbh. I think the polls have it very close to 50/50
---
If they roll filthy horde are they really your friends?
---
Yes. That or pserver.
---
This could be posted every day for all I care. So beautiful!!
---
Bite+Claw is a minimal dps increase *if* you manage it yourself or have an addon do it for you. 
---
I’d get Claw only.
---
i can now see the frame to import the spec, but as soon as i click OK i get this error:

Not classic related but Death Knight. Warriors didn’t have a class rep, people had all these cool ideas on the forums for a long time.
---
DK’s get released and warriors are like, “we asked for that wtf.”
---
Nope not unless you add a pet passive command either by manually hitting that hotkey to pull your pet off the target or by adding it to a macro (you can combine 2 skills in one button as the 2nd is a pet action and not a player action)
---
Maybe this sub should be dead until launch then
---
You put warlock as worse in PvP than mages? Only in large scale pvp is that the case
---
Cats are more DPS than wolves in raids.
---
If you’re on mobile and scroll over to the right, it does list the mobs.
---
WoW maybe had that level of competition during Cata and the like but it really doesn't now. The only reason Arena is an esport is because blizz is pumping money into its walking corpse to keep it alive. Its got a lot of investment for something nobody gives a fuck about. 
---
Only the pastiest of neckbeards watch arena, and I dont mean that ironically, the only guys I've ever meet who watch arena are already incredibly hardcore to begin with. There's no mass appeal. The viewership is bad. Blizz should axe Arena esports and use that budget elsewhere.
---
Agreed, a talent that reduces downtime is absolutely useless while leveling.
---
What makes axe smith profitable
---
What is that?
---
Always. I am the most paranoid tank you’ll come across. 
---
The more you do something, the more confident you become. I am the opposite for tanking. I am confident in MY skills as a tank, but am NOT confident in a PUG’s ability do do their roles properly. I babysit PUGs, because the alternative = corpse run + rage + repair bull
---
Less.  At one point I ran a spare account to bot with Glider too.  Glider was much more of a pain to set up and run.
---
Yes pretty much for 60 levels. And even at max level it's only really auto attacks for damage.
---
Alliance specific weapon route: Smites hammer -&gt; sword from mor ladim-&gt; WW axe/Ravager/SM quest reward axe -&gt; Mara crock boss axe
---
This is basically your route. Weapon from Mara is worth farming. There are swords and maces with higher top end dmg, but you have to factor in that axes give you 5% crit, making them much better than all other options for leveling.
---
I have no idea what the proportions were/are, but many found battlegrounds to be uninteresting throughout WoW's history. If I had a beta access, I would go because it's expected of me, but would have zero expectation of any interest. That may be true for the present beta testers, or some of them.
---
I fully appreciate that others get enjoyment from bgs, not criticising them in the least.
---
Easier said then done in 40man raids bro.
---
Unless you're the top tier guild on your server/faction you don't just have choice of all the most worthwhile players to go with.  Most guilds will have to be bring some relative dead weight players just because a warm body is better than an empty slot most nights.
---
You will probably need gear.  You MIGHT be able to do it without gear, but it will be a lot harder, and it will take a lot longer.  The higher you get the higher the need for gear will be.
---
Just pick up and save some int gear while leveling.  Some quest items are pre raid BIS, so be careful not to sell those.  After that, just spec resto, and you will likely find groups.
---
I would always queue right before dinging so I could play lvl 20-29 bracket as a lvl 30 Druid with travel form or have my mount in a 30-39 bracket. Car form also for Druids at 20
---
I played a gnome warlock in vanilla and I still get flashbacks of undead warriors
---
OGame \^\^
---
I'm just confused about what you don't understand.
---
Holy trinity is a style of roles that a lot of modern MMORPGs use. You have 3 core roles: tank, healer, damage (DPS). The tank attempts to keep enemies hitting them rather than allies. There are often leadership expectations with the tank role. The healer heals everyone, especially the tank. DPS does damage. The healer and DPS are dispoportionately squishier compared to the tank.
---
If you never tanked or healed before I suggest give it a try one way or another.
---
This has some consequences to class choices, especially during leveling. For instance, Warlocks, Mages, Rogues, and Hunters can't heal or tank in dungeons. They can only deal damage.
---
Priests, Paladins, Shamans, and Druids can heal.
---
Warriors are quintessential vanilla tanks, druids can tank, too, mostly, and paladins can tank a limited amount of easier content but not the hardest stuff.
---
*prepares for tomatoes*
---
Man go to the other fucking sub if you wanna talk BFA fucking dillhole
---
Original vanilla had a standard content road map that led us from MC up to Naxx 40 the the launch of TBC +. Outside of that we had PVP and the HWL/GM grind. 
---
Do you think we will see a classic specific content  arch that doesn’t lead us into expansions and keeps us in the classic configuration? 
---
The original WoW team lead covered his thoughts  on that on his stream. https://www.twitch.tv/videos/432126733
---
What do you guys think?
---
[https://willitclassic.com](https://willitclassic.com)
---
Yeah and just keep random green drops of the owl/eagle/falcon etc
---
Eh, it might scratch the itch but the game is very different from what it used to be. I'm currently having fun leveling with my wife but I think it's more just playing a game with her than the game itself.
---
Youre the man! That helps a ton. Are priests the best healers?
---
How dare you
---
I hope you are right, and there is a decent chance you are.
---
However consider that blizzard listens only to me and removes world buffs in raids. If you are right, the effects are negligible. If the video is right, or I am right, then we just avoided a massive shitshow. Right now its really speculative because private servers and classic will operate differently, and we can't really say with any certainty how that difference will play out (relative to the world buff meta).
---
I applaud you for running the guild how you say, and maybe if a million other variables line up I might even consider applying. At least you can get some satisfaction in rejecting it!
---
When the amygdala takes the wheel.
---
There’s plenty of interactions/mechanics that ported from the retail client. This is a valid concern.
---
I'd love to see you play with 12 action buttons, no raid frames and no quest tracker
---
There's probably more I forgot but those are the main ones I remember missing from the default UI in classic.
---
It didn't back in the day, blizz  might change it (hopefully not) don't have beta or haven't seen any details. But true to form, it does not. So druids can use a noggenflogger and constantly shapeshift and it's always a skeleton.
---
Mages are perceived as an easy class to play as they do a ton of DPS and have the ability to craft their own water+food. This means you'll have some down time between pulls but you're not spending money on consumables. 
---
In terms of end game, raids always need mages as they consistently top DPS charts and can produce said consumables for the raid.
---
Also if you can master AOE grinding you can level up super quick
---
ARCANITE REAPER, HOOOOOOOO
---
Plebeians: Write words to express their thoughts and use font formatting to express emphasis.
---
You, an Intellectual: "yikes sweaty"
---
How do the classes compare to each other from an ease of mechanics in a PVP perspective? Easiest to play at a high level? Hardest to play at a high level? Most carpal tunnel inducing class? Most straightforward class?
---
I believe that's from an addon typically.
---
I thought I read that before ~lvl50 spell power was pretty much universally worse than int gear.
---
Hmm, they're up there, but I'm not comfortable answering that question. :D
---
In an interview, Ion said about 2 months for the first 2 phases and then they’d let the community’s progress decide the rest.
---
&gt; and I think Vanilla is best played addon free
---
Why would we play it in any different way than we did back in retail vanilla?
---
Weapon skill doesn't do anything in PVP.
---
We have all been playing for AB, WSG, AV for 15 years? Is there really anything new?
---
Beautiful.
---
So this means it won't be insanely long and dragged on.
---
Such a good idea, and I think 2 months for the first 2 phases is perfect.
---
Track Hidden fonctionne aussi bien pour les deux que pour les autres. Suivre des humanoïdes n'aide pas du tout avec les unités furtives.
---
Oh! Well I have no idea what azerite traits are but templating or something like that was one of the ways I was thinking you can have a linear gear progression that would be working in raids but not out in the open world or BGs in order to keep the ilvl in check, the AQ40 gear and Naxx was already outscaling the open world content with quite a bit.
---
no1 knows.  Best guess is 2-3 months.
---
I don't see a lot people saying priest?
---
For me being a holy guy with light spells just isn't enough, every class has a nice edge to it, for me being a holy man or shadow man is too generic to me
---
Never played one, will never put my time in
---
that's exactly why i said "should", the only reason a tank should give the group an actual mana break is for a difficult pull/boss, there is no reason to hang around while the healer is drinking if you're full hp and have an easy pack near you that you need to clear.
---
Suit yourself, but if you start giving loot to dead weight, everyone else is going to be looking for another guild.
---
What was your favorite class in Mass Effect?
---
Exactly that, they're called the auto attack simulator for a reason. Good if you like healing though as they're potentially the 2nd best healers in game at priests
---
I thought that was a glave.
---
Source for this? I believe you but I’ve actually looked for this earlier and couldn’t find it
---
Make honor kills and objectives give way more honor. This way ganking other players in AV is more worth it.
---
Makes it so your volume won’t go above a certain limit. For instance: if you set it at 3 Dc and then scream, it will cap the volume at 3 Dc instead of going to 40+ and blowing out our ears.
---
Fairly easy to set up, pretty sure OBS has one built in and if not then Voicemeter Banana is great for this.
---
Wait why would skip that talent..... it's one of the reasons shadow priest deal good damage for leveling........
---
I'm hoping for most servers to be at least 60/40 or vice versa.
---
Why do you think so? The wording implies it will impact all of your Shadow Spells and that's exactly what it does. Shadowform and Darkness have almost exactly the same wording, except they removed the word "spell" from Shadowform likely for brevity.    
---
The only non-spells that is in the Shadow school are Shadow Wands.
---
Yeah I agree
---
You're very generalizing that all QOL is bad.  I was expanding on which QOL is bad.
---
I think you misunderstand what people think is bad and are applying it to something that will not be considered an issue.
---
Just trying to broaden your understanding of the "QOL is bad" point of view you seem to incorrectly perceive.
---
Yeah, I doubt it will be more than 18 months for Naxx and no more than 24 months for TBC.
---
The thing that sucks most about off-meta class specs is the fact that you will not get tier gear that's useful for you.
---
I tried a bit of BfA recently as I rolled Alliance for the launch, now I wanted to see the Horde's story. I've probably had 5 pieces or so go from a green/blue quest reward and Epic UPGRADE!!11 from PvP 1-114. 
---
Everytime it happened I felt nothing. If anything I felt like it was stupid. I didn't deserve Epic gear from finishing my random no name quest...
---
Don't forget to check out Staves as an option while leveling. Many have pretty high dps and people tend to forget about them and favor 2h maces or axes.
---
He’s referring to everyone commenting wrong information. He’s not bashing you he’s bashing people who are telling you wrong information
---
People theory crafting like this worries me for classic. Some people are totally going to screw themselves thinking they are being clever.
---
Never raided hardcore, eh?
---
If you're rushing to 60 dont bother going after certain pieces of gear. It'll just end up being a waste of money
---
No, no, no... If we bring back the REALLY REALLY boring version, then people will want to play it even more.  #logic
---
Yeah I'm aware, never once able to get my hand on the chest. Stuff like that is a good way to add content without really putting in a lot of effort, same goes for the fishing contest. 
---
As for the Arathi Highlands I recall it being talked about before launch as one of the areas where factions would be competing over stuff in the zone but it was scrapped and reduced to a couple of troll NPCs attacking the.. whatever the horde outpost is called. Hammerfall?
---
most of the posters on this sub didn't play classic at launch. 1.12 players who never made it to 60 most likely
---
I’m no changes. I couldn’t care less about pvp or the battlegrounds. It’s 10% of what wow has to offer. I never did then in vanilla and won’t be doing them this time around.
---
Yeah, 18 months seems fine to me.
---

Will my PC (i5-3570k, AMD Radeon 7850 2gb) be able to run classic at 60 FPS on medium graphics?

Unironically yes. Post not great but yes, game would be better without world buff meta
---
https://youtu.be/DdZH3UAwUZo?t=572
---
That means you're gonna go Horde
---
I guess i was interpreting to much :-/   
---
i was not sure if it would increase my spell damage from my gear or my spells directly.
---
Okay lesson learned
---
first aid. powerful antivenom. doesn't force the potion cd. It doesn't solve the problem permanently, but at least it delays it temporarily
---
Yea that could work for sure
---
Not everyone knows this. We sure as hell didn't know when Vanilla launched either.
---
This sub tells people "PLAY WHAT YOU WANT" to interested Classiic players when that is entirely misleading to not present the true story of how fucked you are if you go Ret, Oomkin, Disc, etc.
---
Personally, I want to main a spec that my guild won't take because it isn't optimal. I'm not going to leave them, because I want to be in a good guild. That spec I have the most fun with is shit and therefore makes me have to play something I would prefer not to, unless I enjoy 4 hour Molten Core runs with meme spec only guilds.
---
Now imagine how many people feel that way, and how much more enjoyment they could get if their favorite spec was viable. You know how many people are going Fury and Frost just because they are so fucking good and not actually what they enjoy? A lot.
---
You know, I'm actually quite a competent googler and quite good at learning things on my own, I've been doing it for a very long time.
---
You know what the difference is between "usually" and now? The fact that you're trying to make me learn something that probably isn't even real.
---
Yeah my bad, forgot i usually scatter before fd to trap and the pet stops atk when i scatter!
---
Bonereaver's Edge is a sword.  
---
Deathbringer is good but also 56.38 dps, you are not going to use it over 6x+ dps swords.
---
That's the classic experience. It is also how people learn (and how talents find new usages).    
---
I agree this will happen. I don't understand why it would worry anyone though.
---
doesn't matter shamans &gt; paladins
---
By this logic we should also remove keybinding since most people didn't use them in vanilla.
---
&gt;One shaft of light that shows the way
---
no mortal man can win this day
---
where did i say QOL is bad? I'm just pointing out the duality of this sub in which some people are vehemently against any qol (see the #nochanges crowd) and soke are very much in favor. If i had to say, I'd put myself somewhere in the middle
---
Hardcore is the only raiding I've ever done. In Vanilla, in Retail, and on Pservers. We've had several realm firsts and record times/kills.
---
Couldn't fly unless you were in outlands.     
---
Flying mounts in outlands made it amazing, you could see people questing, and fly right down to them.   Made hunting for people to kill even easier...     
---
Not only that, you couldn't even fly until 70, so questing Wpvp was still awesome too.
---
Yeah that clearly happened in every DKP guild.  Oh wait no DKP was extremely popular and carried a lot of us through AQ40 gearing.
---
If you run loot council you're going to be losing players because of favoritism.
---
Anyways the idea is to get your guildmates to buy into whichever system you do choose.  And some things in DKP can still be decided by council like first hunter quest, first sulfuras and first thunderfury.  As long as these are clearly defined ahead of time.
---
But your going to run MC/BWL/Onyx so often you want to gear up your whole raid eventually to push further into content.  You don't need to give 4 pieces to MT and shaft everyone else to accomplish this.  These raids aren't that hard.  Please the guild so everyone is being rewarded for their participation.  They all matter to the progress.  Also improve your worst player.. Don't just gkick, many people have a lot of room to grow. 
---
But whatever if you want to treat people that way instead of raising them up.  That's on you.
---
For classic it's hunters. Was my first class to hit max lvl, fun leveling but I hated raiding on it. Never went back til the class was heavily reworked. In general, druid is something I don't see myself ever playing. I have tried many times over the years but I just despise how the class functions in any spec. However I am grateful that other people are willing to play it for me.
---
? what does this even mean, the tank is always making pulling decisions all the time, they are the 'leader' of the group usually because of this, they mark, they decide when, how and where to pull, if they lead the group to a wipe its the tanks fault, there is a reason most GMs play tank
---
Ah thanks for that!
---
&gt;summons mostly benefit others
---
meh. not really. This is the scenario where warlock summon is amazing for the warlock.  
---
you are about 45 minutes deep into an UBRS run right? 
---
Healer says: sorry folks. gotta run. 
---
tank says: no probs, I got another healer ready to go. lets summon her.  
---
this is where summoning helps you the warlock.
---
If there was no warlock in the group. You might have to wait 20 minutes or more for that healer to run to the instance, and then run down to your group. There could respawns. there could be opposing faction ganking the instance zone in.
---
A lot of people are going to be extremely disappointed because of that video.
---
Never played it!
---
&gt; If we're being hyper-literal, then you should note that I never made this specific claim. You're making assumptions about what I've typed - hence words into mouth.
---
Are you fucking kidding me?
---
So, I say you said **beyond** the timer, you tell me that's words in your mouth.
---
I clarify, that you **literally** said beyond the timer, you tell me thats hyper literal. 
---
I change it to suspend for you, since you were accusing me of being too literal, you now say you never claimed that. Fuck me dude.
---
&gt;The exploit is when a guild pressures its raiders to not play the characters they want to play to retain a buff.
---
That's not an expliot thats a **CHOICE.**
---
&gt;. Logging out and not playing the game shouldn't give you a leg up over another player who chose not to log out for a week.
---
And it doesn't necessarily. Not only do you not need to log out to get the buff for a raid, but you also can gain several advantages by using the time you would have been logged out to do other things. **Anyone** can get the buff, logging out doesn't change that. It's not a leg up.
---
You got some numbers that are off and some important number dps/hps differences too (like shaman is 4 on HPS but 1 on DPS so 2.5 overall if joined)
---
Got it. Thanks man!
---
keybinding doesnt require me to logout to preserve them.
---
24/0/27 is the preferred resto spec for raiding once you have a decent set of gear. I’m not sure what gear level they make the switch.
---
The healing hierarchy kind works like this:
---
Best tank healer: paladin
---
Best raid healer (debatable): shaman (healing everyone else but the tank) 
---
Priests fall somewhere between the paladin and shaman in that they have spells that can fill both roles in a raid and are strong in both regard. 
---
Weakest healers are Druid, but bring a lot of utility.
---
Ultimately, healing is an area that brings a lot of player skill into account, more so than dps imo. All classes are viable healers, they just excel in different areas.
---
PvE hunter rotation is actually pretty complex compared to most dps rotations. Usually it’s chaining aimed shot and multi shot with auto attacks.  Doing a clipped or full rotation depending on your bow speed plus being able to swap trinkets mid boss fight is unique. One of the main reasons hunter excites me actually is how they PvE
---
You can try to replace the contents of line 20 in TalentSequence.lua, replacing

    local talentsString = _G[self:GetParent():GetName().."EditBox"]:GetText();

with

    local talentsString = self.editBox:GetText();

On my 19 twink rogue I could kill hunters with my gun
---
This is a garbage post.
---
...like shadow damage wands getting buffed from it?
---
I'm not sure either to be honest.
---
Memes are for old people? I thought the opposite. Memes for the most part arent funny and childish imo. If anything, I feel old because I don't think they are funny, not the other way around.
---
Because OP was confused as to whether it increased his damage or increased his "increases shadow damage dealt by spells and effects" stats on gear.
---
s9 games were over almost immediately as healers went oom instantly and DK/Warriors/Kitties did too much damage
---
What rogue hurt you? Lol
---
if you are in a melee group, they start to turn into active mitigation as you weave windfury buffs with grace.
---
This is completely against what the video itself said.
---
Aside from one world-fist Kel'Thuzad kill, vanilla guilds didn't do this.
---
Wasnt, s4 was but only if you had both glaives which barely anyone had
---
&gt; I first played the original WoW beta at a friends house back in 2004. All my friends bought WoW vanilla on release and I played extensively 
---
I call bullshit. Not once did you mention setting your alarm for 5am. Getting into queue and going back bed, to wake up after 10 and still be in queue to just log in.
---
Fortnite poggers!
---
It seems to be a problem at 60 more than levelling. Affliction spells have the hit talent and most of the spells you use while levelling are affliction.
---
It's really quite arrogant... "haha, in 5 minutes i discovered something that other people haven't in 15 years!"
---
Everyone says this, but no one ever says why. Why is going from 0 to +20 frost damage much worse than going from +80 to +100?  
---
It seems like just another thing someone said once and now everyone repeats mindlessly.  
---
No, *because you still have to cast the same amount of frostbolts to kill something* or *intellect lets you cast more frostbolts* pseudo-maths reasons are not real reasons.
---
2nd this one, the site is legit and has an amazing atlas.
---
Yesssss this.   Play what interests you.  Do you want to be a beefy damaging axe wielding madman? Arms or fury warrior will be your jam.   Want to be the most holiest of healers?  Try paladin or priest.  Want to be a powerhouse of magical damage dealing?  Mage or warlock will do it for you!  Undecided?  Try paladin,  shaman,  or druid.  Hunters and rogues are great at getting out of dangerous situations so if you want to be a survivalist these are for you. 
---
Play it like an RPG, and you're bound to get hooked on it.  WoW isn't as addictive as people say,  it's just a really fun game that you can keep playing for unlimited hours.
---
And how far did you actually get in Naxx?
---
Ok so me and my bro are rolling mage and rogue on launch day. Is it realistic that we could both roll mining and engineering? Our main goal is wpvp at 60. I’m worried there won’t be enough nodes for us both since we are planning on leveling exclusively together.  if rolling double engineering isn’t possible what would be a good replacement for me or the rogue.
---
Pally/Warrior for sure.
---
Female dwarf rogue.
---
1.	They know how powerful stoneform is.

2.	They want to min/max humiliation.

3.

Either option is equally scary.

Why would blizzard release a shit product?
---
People act as if they are oblivious to the downsides of layering...
---
No biggy. If you ever want to learn more about a talent, you can also look it up on WoWHead for example this is [Darkness's Rank 1 mechanics](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=15259/darkness). The "value" on WoWHead right now is always 1 too low, it is a bug, just assume 2%. But that tells you which spells it impacts and how.    
---
You can see mechanically it applies three different auras that impact different schools of Shadow Spells. In all it impacts "everything" a Shadow Priest would cast.
---
Some addons might work if they don't rely on any of the functions blizzard blocked.
---
We played Horde in Vanilla, so we have people wanting to relive the nostalgia and others wanting to experience something new.
---
I raided with Bloodskull &amp; helped him get all that gear he's wearing. He's nothing special, but it's nice of him to make some educational videos. :)
---
Hell yeah, brother. Cheers from Ravenholdt.
---
Imagine rolling horde
---
I could never get into rogue because I really don't like the energy system. You're constantly out of energy, spamming a hotkey while waiting for ticks. I could never get used to the pacing for it.
---
100% agree. Warlocks are smelly.
---
they'd be bored regardless of version.  i've been playing wc3 because AV (especially with no rep gains and on premade characters) is boring as fuck
---
No...?
---
The problem is that in the current meta everyone is going to use them every raid night.
---
Back in classic my guild never used them except for Lotheb / 4 Horseman / saph / KT.  
---
Even so it caused a lot of problems.  It simply wasn’t fun to waste the first 1hr + of raid night running around to get all of them.  It caused constant drama when people would get picked off by horde or died to a trash mob etc.  If we wiped everyone would get super mad at the person that caused it etc.  It caused a lot of people to quit the game in my guild at the time.
---
Once the majority of people figured out how good they were and started using them every raid in BC Blizzard made it so they never worked in raids anymore.

If you think aestethics as a branch of philosophy for example isn't real i am not too convinced that you have competence in anything. But i am glad that you feel self-confident about leaning alone. Not sure if "learning long time" is a good thing though, usually smart people learn pretty fast. But lets not get stuck on the negative things! Lets be Happy that our conversation made you see your problems and now you are motivated to start fixing them! Glad i could help you to get started!

DKP is garbage. New recruits get shafted and just /gquit once they find out how many points their competition has. It leads to classes conspiring together to not spend DKP on items only they can use. And it rewards mere attendance far too much. It also forces people to pass on loot they could use but don't want to waste points on. It leads to point saving and drama and isn't fair to all classes/specs.
---
Their repair bill is drastically cheaper than say a warrior though.
---
Still rolling it, gotta be the cheetah mang
---
Unpopular opinion: AV sucked, always did. People did it for the rewards which were/are really good.
---
For sure for sure. But we can't forget that it's also referred to as the Nintendo Crater, with references to the Super Mario Brothers, Donkey Kong and Legend of Zelda.
---
What a chad.
---
I've played every class except a rogue. I just don't feel it tbh
---
The leveling ease is what draws me to pally/lock. Plus double free mount.
---
I would really recommend at least trying once for strike of the hydra. Blackfathom deeps has a blue cloak, blue gloves, and blue chest that are all something that is going to be a clear upgrade for you and that you have absolutely no issues rolling need on (it's not an agility cloak like the deadmines one). 
---
Strike of the hydra makes archeus completely irrelevant, as it shows up about 5 levels earlier and is just better. More dps, same swing timer, and it's super well leveled for the instance. the last boss is level 28 and it's a level 26 min item, so you can actually get strike of the hydra before you can even equip it. And even if you fail? you still likely got to roll on a blue piece of mail and get the arctic buckler as a minor quest reward.
---
They really are convenient. Also, a small side-benefit of having teleports to major cities is you can set your hearthstone to a convenient out of the way location. 
---
For Horde: Kargath, and you're never more than 5 minutes from Blackrock Mountain, whereas everyone else has to take a zeppelin from Org to UC, then a 10 minute flight path.
---
For Alliance: Feralas or Cenarion Hold so that you are right next to Dire Maul and Silithus. Everyone else has to fly from Ironforge to the boat, then fly across half of Kalimdor.
---
Whatever floats your boat, it really won't make any difference while levelling. If you're going to play a lot of BGs together **and** the pally is ok going healbot it's very hard to go past holy/warrior - if you can get some decent gear from raiding you'll tear up the pugs.
---
Paladin/Warrior is the best in terms of killing speed. It essentially zero down-time and large pulls.    
---
That being said, there's SOME gear clashing. If the Paladin wants Mail then Plate, they may be rolling for the same gear in some circumstances. I don't think this "kills" the combo, just a footnote. If the Paladin is going to sick to healer gear, it is less of a problem.
---
All 3 axes are very strong. Arcanite reaper, nightfall, and annihilator, but particularly arcanite reaper.
---
I've yet to really play Druid, but my buddy did back in the day. They're so mobile and have so many tools. They take forever to kill someone, but they're really good in the right hands.
---
you must be black

Dont forget to summon the replacement,  the group has to run to the entrance to summon. You cant summon the guy to inside the instance.
---
Inside to inside summon or outside to outside only.
---

---
I wouldn't assume that the OPs intent. Good for OP to try and completely understand the talents instead of copying and pasting off the internet. Those are the ones that will be screwing themselves when they don't understand why those talents were chosen.
---
Mostly Annihilator and Nightfall. Both items provide a unique debuff that's really strong in raids.
---
Annihilator's debuff stacks with other armor reducing debuffs. It is a very good weapon for tanks going into MC. Even after getting raid gear offtanks will still use it just to apply the debuff to the boss when they aren't actively tanking. It's also an axe which makes it ideal for Orcs (most popular Horde race), due to the extra weapon skill they get.
---
Nightfall is amazing at every raid tier. You give one to an Enhance Shaman, Ret Paladin, or Hunter and let them keep the debuff up. It's a massive increase to raid DPS, especially at later tiers of content once casters get their gear. Very few people will be Axesmiths, and even fewer will take the time and effort to grind out the Thorium Brotherhood rep required to get the recipe.

Is the DC woman Catwoman? That's the only one I'm unsure of. All of the marvel characters + Superman and Robin are 10/10, Batman and what I think is Catwoman are pretty weak :p
---
No it makes perfect sense.
---
You should include the importance of each factor in your calculation. This is called an Average Weighted Decision Matrix and it gives you personalized results. 
---
The factors you've chosen, especially PvP, can be broken down into duels, world PvP, split by battleground, etc. Good example is Druid who is very role specific in WSG and AB. You should definitely break down each class by talent spec as well. Giving weights to the entire class doesn't make much sense.
---
If you want to start a Google Sheets collaboration for this, I'd be happy to contribute.

4 hours of work compared to 10 hours of mining
---
&gt;WOW doesn't start until you hit 60
---
Arbitrary number, i think a lot more people would agree that it starts at max level and not ''60''. Since 30 was max level they were playing it as if it was 60. They were farming lvl 30 BiS which was kind of unexplored territorie and that alone made it fun. 
---
Its 40 now btw.
---
Bro. You’re talking about playing WoW, and you haven’t played mass effect!? I recognize wow came first, but you’re missing out here. 
---
If you enjoy rpgs or sci-fi games in any shape or form, go buy all three immediately!
---
How old was everyone when they found out the Trinket slot icon was an earring? I think I was around 22... and I’ve been playing the game since I was 12.
---
So? You are arguing that because a system wasn't widely used it is okay to remove.
---
paladin will have 15 minute buffs from the start I do believe which buff the entire class instead of 90% buffing over and over.
---
Ok, so what's your incredibly fulfilling, life affirming gameplay at 60? Killing bosses that are easy even if half the dps and healers d/c? Ganking players in pve specs just trying to get to dungeons? Grinding hundreds of hours to fill up a rep bar or for a new mount skin?
---
This post offends me on every level as a NE hunter :). Might compensate by needing some weapons I don't need and accidentally pull a whole dungeon with my pet. /s
---
I found out it's /openfire thanks for your comment though and have a nice day
---
Dragon Age?
---
In other games do you enjoy a melee class or a class that does damage from range? Or a healer?
---
That's correct. One major discrepancy between the private server meta and Vanilla is that the head turn-ins (Onyxia, Nefarian) are often on a much shorter cooldown on pservers. [The Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=22888/rallying-cry-of-the-dragonslayer) is definitely one of the biggest buffs available in the game, so it is certain that the buff will be rarer or harder to obtain in Classic. The degree to which that difference will impact Classic is one big part of the contention on this issue.
---
I mostly played healer back in TBC-Cata. And in PVP that was mostly as a pally.
---
yes lol
---
anyone that doesn't think this is literally trolling
---
just imagine what twitch is going to look like too
---
you won't see anyone streaming retail with over 100-300 viewers unless its Josh
---
There's a leg enchant in the burning steppes that I think requires a quest chain to unlock.  Not 100% on that.  Either way, you have to bring certain mats to the npc, and he gives you an item that allows you to apply the enchant.   I don't recall if they are unique, but it doesn't matter if they are, since you can just go back with more mats to get another one.
---
Will the epic pvp gear be available at launch?
---
Yeah, I remember my first char back in 2005. I was a nelf druid with talents in all three trees, all over the place and by level 30 I was getting my ass handed to me so badly from creatures the same level as me, that I rolled a new class.
---
&gt; you now say you never claimed that
---
Correct. You're making assumptions based on my word choice. It was an ambiguous statement and you keep doubling down on this point for no reason even though I've clarified what I meant in other posts. For what purpose? It's not adding to the discussion to keep hammering this point, it's playing *gotcha* at best. At worst it demonstrates that your argument is so flimsy it requires a wording error on my part.
---
&gt; That's not an expliot thats a CHOICE.
---
Exploits involve choices. Are you trying to make the claim that exploits only happen by accident?
---
&gt; It's not a leg up.
---
*Wow*. Okay dude.
---
I would be shocked if they re-released expansions. The community would be so divided
---
There's a couple factors here for point 1. If a group is a bit overleveled for the instance, has a composition with good CC, or maybe something like a shadow priest DPS for passive offheals, you shouldn't run into any problems. Just hang onto INT gear you come across and make some space in your bags and you're golden. You shouldn't need to have "good" gear to pull this off. The great thing about shamans is you can wear leather, cloth, and mail, so you'll be able to take advantage of a lot of unwanted drops and quest rewards for this. The higher level dungeons (starting about Sunken Temple, maybe Maraudon depending on the group) will start to become very difficult. This is about when tanks and healers start respeccing and getting dedicated to those roles or there will be a lot of wipes. But for everything beneath that you should be good.
---
For point 2, I'd make it known you're looking for healing stuff when you join a dungeon group, and run lots of dungeons. Often times there will be unwanted drops (stuff the healer already has) that you can soak up.
---
Bear in mind this is based on my private server experiences. I played in vanilla but not a shaman, and I never made it to 60 then.
---
Naxx yeh but TBC isn't even confirmed or anything.
---
Thankfully there's still people like you around in this world.
---
Can't have this problem if you don't have friends
---
* They are repeatable. You just need to have whatever the relevant mats are. 
---
* Note that not all of the possible ones will be available at launch. For example, some new ones are added with a questgiver in Dire Maul. 
---
*The only quest enchant that I can think of that is not repeatable is the Fiery Blaze Enchantment: classic.wowhead.com/item=5421/fiery-blaze-enchantment
---
Yep. My Disc Priest did a lot of ganking. As did my solo-warrior. Class is irrelevant. Just gotta pick the right time for the right fight.
---
Wouldn't the pally be holy?
---
Actually I can relate.  I was playing Monster Hunter World and when you use a sword and shield, the sword anyways defaults to your LEFT hand.  As a righty, this drives me nuts!!
---
Allright sir I think I need to clarify my backpeddeling. First of all my backwards walking is bound to shiftS and not just S. Secondly I backpedelled o  porpused to appear as a helpless  casual that does not do any harm. With that I tried to increase my chance of getting helped as people generally tend to help the weak instead of the strong.
---
I hope you understand eventhough I'm not English native speaker

---
&gt; If you think aestethics as a branch of philosophy for example isn't real i am not too convinced that you have competence in anything.
---
Now that's a tiny straw man if i saw one, what I said was no one has explained why people would choose aesthetics when doing so moves their goals further out of reach.
---
&gt; Not sure if "learning long time" is a good thing though, usually smart people learn pretty fast.
---
I think this statement says more about you than it does about me tbh, the fact that you believe there is so little to learn that it's possible for a single human being to learn it all is honestly mind blowing.
---
After two years? Nah. The community will want new content and Blizzard is *never* going to spend a dime developing content for Classic. They want to figure out a way to convert Classic players over to Retail and until they do, they'll keep everyone on the tit of content they already have.
---
Yeah agree, I’ve never gotten it and I also hate BFD so I usually skip it but it’s obviously much better
---
If the tank is doing his job properly, he should be taking the minumum of damage. Shield Block is excellent for threat generation as well as reducing incoming damage and thunderclap is used to reduce incoming DPS. The tank should always be facing all of the targets, all of the time. I see a lot of tanks turn their backs to enemies while running around, you can strafe run and it keeps them in front of you and as long as you're spiraling you're fine.
---
But just claim I'm retarded or trolling because you're just another slow player.
---
That's nice dear.
---
Using so many consumables.
---
Outside of patchwerk and the last 4 bosses in Naxx guilds never used flasks or that many consumables at all.
---
I still remember that everyone made fun of the guild that got server 1st Nefarian on our server for being tryhards because they used flasks.
---
Probably just a little cryptominer. /s
---
I would probably level as ret and switch towards the end.
---
The OP didn't say that. And even if they were Holy they might still want a Ret/Prot set. You at least have to consider gear overlap when discussing these things. If the Pally is going full healbot and only rolling on healbot gear, yeah, no issue.
---
Priests have the most versatile healing "kit" because they have a variety of abilities to heal both single targets and groups.  They can "take a break" to get back some mana during combat because of a talent ability that allows them to utilize passive mana gain from their spirit during combat. 
---
Paladins have great single target sustained healing because they get mana back on critical heals.  Paladins also have better survivability and are considered generally easier to play than other healing classes. 
---
Druids have okay healing abilities and the ability to combat resurrect, but they generally don't provide the best healing for raiding.  All healers can easily heal small groups. But druids in classic won't have a regular resurrection ability making them a little less desirable in this role. 
---
I don't really know shamans as well,  but I hear they have a versatile buff set through totems which makes them desirable for both raiding and group content.   As I mainly play alliance I can't really comment on their raid or sustained healing ability. 
---
I personally chose priest based on my research but I don't currently have a sub or access to beta so I won't be playing until August.
---
Didn't get most end wing bosses. Which is relevant to your argument how?
---
Female ud always
---
Well then I guess a hunter is used for misdirection in Naxx.
---
If this ever happens to you, you brought it upon yourself.
---
Warriors. Charge is super fun. But they are so fragile when alone and don't offer much support to others. 
---
(I'm a healer and support at heart so this explains why).
---
Engineering topkek
---
Sweet, was worried we’d have to run MC for eight months
---
Strider meat is bad drop rate, but it has no followup so there is no rush and you can just kill striders as you do the rest of the zone so it is time efficient xp.
---
No, there won’t be honor kills
---
You can't even get honor from kills at launch...
---
Level a new character, help people, explore, wind back on WoW for a while. People are different, what appeals to one does not necessarily appeal to another.
---
Um, in pve? Because in pve ret is awful. PvP sure, it can be good.
---
Ez dut uste
---
Hpal/Warrior, you'll quest with ease and quickly form dungeon groups due to only having to find dps. And warrior with a dedicated pocket healer is a scary thing in PvP.
---
you're making excuses just heal the tank and don't be a baby. I regularly do speed runs where I'm at 10% mana for a while and even with a two hand tank and don't let them die out of pettiness. sad
---
I wanna say shaman because totems are awful and leveling them is a pain.
---
Remind me to not do premades with you, thanks.
---
I remember leveling and getting one shot by an Undead Rogue in Duskwood of all places. 
---
Instant fear afterwards when hearing the stealth animation.
---
one of you goes herb/engineering 
---
you should both be engineering, but you don't need mining to engineer just some way of making gold
---
The idea is to have more chests scattered across the world, so players venture out and look for them.
---
At 1080? Yes. My latop with a dual core 'u' and 750m can.
---
I never played mass effect but have played wow since vanilla. I think mass effect looks boring and uninteresting.
---
Or play prot pally, and whoever wants you wants you? It's not selfish to join any group that wants to take you. Most people probably won't even be able to get a tank, so if they choose to take a prot pally that's on them.
---
Yes. 
---
&gt; From the classic demo, we learned that the riding system is the older race riding one, instead of the profession-esque system we have today in modern wow introduced in Patch 1.12.1. What was the train of thought behind this decision?
---
The modern riding system was introduced in one of the later 1.12 patches, and as we were discussing it, we felt this system was added to prepare the game for Burning Crusade, which had the ability to ride flying mounts.
---
For most of the history of WoW Classic, throughout 2004 and 2005, we had the older mount system. It just felt more authentic to that game, to use the older one instead of one that just laid the groundwork for another expansion."
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=292170/riding-and-epic-mounts-in-classic-wow
---
the idea would to make Naxx/t3 the max gear, but add t1, t2, t3 sets in new raids. These new tier sets would have not only different attribute allocation, but also new tier set bonuses. So you could get a new T2 rogue set with a 5 piece set bonus that gives bonus % to a talent. Like 20% increased Master of Deception talent so you have better stealth. Gear set bonuses could we a way for players to enhance their talents and create new talent specs. Imagine if ret paladins could boost the effectiveness of the Retribution tree through raid gear set bonuses. If you change the talent trees, you risk homogenizing the classes. That is what the expansions did. They tried to make everything viable, giving way too many abilities/talents to classes. The classes weren't unique anymore. Having tier set bonuses that enhanced your talent trees could be a better solution.
---
Having new tier sets would give players new looks. Instead of being stuck looking the same as every other BWL Priest, you could now look different. Additionally, there could be more mount grinds and drops in raids. There could be tradeskill recipes that only drop in raids for engineer or enchanting etc.. ?
---
This isn't a priority really, but Blizzard originally intended to make player housing. I think having players or guild housing in certain parts of the world could work.
---
There could be a second honor system that is entirely dedicated to world PvP. Give players more reasons to fight in the open world. At the very least Blizzard should have boosted the honor gains in World PvP, so players could rank up doing it instead of battlegrounds. Having more valuable objectives to take over and resources to control could underpin the World PvP system. This is a rough idea, but World PvP was far too neglected towards the end of Classic.
---
There was a Hero's Call Board in Cataclysm. There could be something similar in Classic where players could create and signup for serverwide events.
---
There will always be a demand from some players for more races/classes etc.. The classes Blizzard introduced in the expansions don't belong in Classic WoW. From a gameplay and lore perspective. However, Worgen and Goblin were prominent in Classic WoW, and adding these two races and their zones would fit in perfectly.
---
Having a new tradeskill profession that allowed players to build. Being able to sail from Booty Bay to the Lost Isles across the ocean could add for a lot of immerson. Being able to fish, pvp, treasure hunt, and just hang out on the open seas might be fun.
---
If you are rolling together one should go herbalism so you are not both mining. Selling the herbs on ah to get eng supplies will work just as well. Both mining means you'll take way longer to level it and get the same amount of materials as if only one had it.
---
No it’s not. You’re nice.
---
Sssure. I still hope it's either gone in a few weeks, or made unexploitable - somehow...
---
Maybe leatherworking/skinning on the enchanter? Or are y’all both looking for engineering for pvp?
---
As did I. Isn't it great that both of us can have fun at both ends of the spectrum.
---
&gt; Exploits involve choices. Are you trying to make the claim that exploits only happen by accident?
---
Ok, is the choice to use a flask because my guild pressured me an exploit?
---
Remember, people who chose to actually use the flasks shouldn't get a leg up on me.
---
This x100
---
Warriors and hunters.
---
Pally/warr. 
---
You can 2 man a hell of a lot. 
---
And would be the next best thing to unkillable in pvp
---
I feel you :'(
---
Idk but  2 months P1 seems pretty short to me.
---
Ofc hardcore guilds will have everything cleared early but huge part of playerbase wont even hit 60 after 2 months.
---
I honestly think a main prot tank and an off feral tank are enough as long as you have a fury warrior tank when needed.
---
this post made me setup a server so i could see how close this pic was (i have no active sub anymore)
---
here is the result
---
[https://imgur.com/uZ4hAL9](https://imgur.com/uZ4hAL9)
---
There's really no way to balance it so it's good in AV but not op in WSG.
---
If pally plate existed and they had a taunt for the fights that demand it (4horse, for example) they wouldn't have been so bad. I played a prot tank at the tail end of vanilla, and not having avenger's wasn't a problem. Not having appropriate gear was.
---
Balancing out specs worked fine for BC/WotLK.
---
I’ve just watched friends trying to play on pservers spec totally wrong and then have to spend all their starting gold to respec which is a bit discouraging
---
&gt; I bet many people would be turned away from the game if that were to happen
---
To be honest, I think this effect is overestimated. And if someone gives up on the game due to first few days being unplayable, they probably didn't really want to play in the first place.

You might find the JAWs reference in vanilla intriguing.
---
World PvP.  Too bad it was sort of ruined by adding Battlegrounds.
---
WSG, AB, and 1.12 AV won't be so epic 15 years later.
---
Tanking spec is whatever you’re specced as. You can literally clear all content in any of the cookie cutter specs. Even 31/20 pvp works fine.
---
No. Are you capable of being genuine? JFC
---
I am saying that if the community responds to world buffs as they have on the private server meta, and if the video that brought this entire topic up is anywhere near accurate, then buffs should be removed in raids. I am saying that the #nochange people should actually be on board with this because if you arent a sperg, and you are saying #nochange for an actual reason - such as keeping the vanilla experience accurate - then removing world buffs in raids is actually a step in preserving that experience. Stacking world buffs wasn't a thing back in the day, pick your reason as to why, it just wasn't. 
---
There is a legitimate concern it will be a problem in classic. There are some people who have made reasonable suggestions that it may not be a concern, and indeed it is speculation either way.
---
I watched it, so speak for yourself, peasant.
---
Yea but see your last point is exactly what I’m addressing, “of frozen wrath greens are almost always better” just isn’t true.  Those greens have 0 stats on them aside from plus frost damage, so in the margins your shatter combo doesn’t fully benefit from it, not to mention the much bigger issue, no stam and no Int.  In a perfect world having +100 frost damage sounds awesome but when you’re leveling in vanilla, survivability goes a really long way, and rocking 1k hp + 2k mana at 40 is going to spell doom for any mage out in the world.
---
The point is for spell power to be even remotely worth it at low levels you need to have a lot of it, which is both rare or expensive, which is exactly why most mages just stack of the eagle. At BEST you having to throw 1-2 fewer frostbolts per mob breaks even with my mana pool, then you have to consider getting resists, which impacts your build more, aggroing extra mobs, or getting ganked, all of which favor the eagle / survivability.  Simply not worth the effort.
---
Thats my plan, Ret to late 50s then holy moly from then on.
---
Crit doesn't really matter and isn't that great for druids. .5 sec cast speed just isn't that important. The main thing is getting enough +healing to enable rank4 HT.
---
Well, you dont really understand the argument and are using some strawman arguments. Losing 10 int for +6 spellpower is clearly not worth it, since, yes, you still have to cast the same amount of frostbolts to kill something and intellect lets you cast more frostbolts. That is not maths whatsoever.
---
Both of you should roll mining + skinning or maybe herbalism. The gold from that 2nd profession will allow you to buy any extra materials you need.
---
Apparently you're not in beta, where 99% of warriors are tanking dungeons with 2H weps
---
Combine that with this:

Easy and pleasant way of spending some time
---
They should've allowed you to place totems at range, like in Warcraft 3.
---
They should've also allowed Chain Heal to bounce at a decent range like in Warcraft 3.
---
They should've also *insert anything crappy about Shaman*, like in Warcraft 3.

It depends if you enjoy a sci-fi universe or not. Imo, it’s certainly not fast paced like halo. 
---
If you were to go watch gameplay for dragon age:origins it would look like the most boring crap on the planet. But it’s the overarching story/characters that are done well. (This one is still my favorite game of all time)
---
Pretty sure it's 10% but yeah either way it's very poor on a spell with a cd. You shouldn't be using shield unless you need something to cast while moving or you're worried someone will die in the time it takes to cast something. The efficiency is terribly.
---
No, stacking spell power while leveling is not really that useful.
---
Stacking spirit and intellect greatly increases your efficiency while leveling.
---
Seems like the base mana gives you enough to cast heal/hot yourself and cat form.
---
You shouldn't have to do it after every fight though.

Assuming your guild kills Ragnaros week one, you'll get 8 clears. If you split up into two teams of 20 after the first clear, that's 15 clears. Onyxia is a little tougher, but resets every 5 days, so let's call it 10 total clears. With ideal loot distribution, that gives the main raid team roughly 400 pieces of loot or 10 per player (of their ~17 gear slots).
---
Prot pally leveling was pretty good once you got access to blessing of sanctuary and especially holy shield. It still felt kind of slow, as you had practically no buttons to push, but running into 3-5 mobs at a time and watching them kill themselves on your reactive damage effects was infinitely more fun than guarenteed death the second an add saw you as a warrior.
---
It's a whole new game compared to retail. The value of items will be very different.
---
Well for you many things propably are mind blowing and i respect that. Things, when they are new to you can have that effect on a person. I didn't say there is little to learn, i said smart people learn fast. But yea we already identified reading comprehension as a problem for you so it is okay. Maybe you could actually start googling that (reading comprehension) and look if you could find help and use your method of "long learning" to that? Maybe next time you can then learn faster like a normal smart person. That would help you in the long run to learn even more in this short life time we have. Can you see that i am creating you almost like a personal plan here how to overcome your problems! Again, glad i could help you.
---
In my private server experience, they were the most wanted class for guild recruitment. Not enough people play them to fill a raid.
---
Ok, here’s my recommendation. 
---
Level as enhancement, keep a heal set, pick up as much mp5 as you can(won’t see much if any till like 40)
---
Put your first 14 points into resto, the increased hit chance and improved totem range is HUGE
---
Vanilla wow is fun to play. It isn't just a skinner box slot machine like retail.
---
That's it, then. Oh well, I'll have to wait until August to try them out.
---
This, 100%
---
Going to get a lot of opinions here, especially about PvP. I say you just play what you enjoy and fuck if its viable or not, as long as you are having fun thats all that matters at the end of the day
---
No one is using Retail data... We're arguing over Pserver auction data versus Auctioneer data from actual Vanilla days.
---
We rushed it back then too. Once we were geared if wasn't hard
---
At this rate we'll be playing tetris
---
I'm not in beta, and I'm also not responsible for people who aren't performing their role.
---
Depending upon how good the healer is by taking more damage they're slowing down the run.
---
Imagine being MT without thunderfury

Every single person can mute it. I guess thats good anyway cause me and my guild like to have fun. 
---
Better then listening to 21 Savage and Post-Malone on repeat imo.
---
Why multiple shot instead of arcane shot?
---
Shadowpriest really wasnt that popular tho? I know that their 1v1 potential is off the charts but I def don't remember having a shortage of healing priests over shadow.
---
Ah thats super helpful! Thank you so much!
---
Levelling you have about 5% miss rate. Raiding you have 16%. So yeah it's mainly just for raiding. Of course you get suppression for afflic spells so +hit isn't really worth it while levelling, you just have to accept your immolate/bolt will regularly resist (not there's really any +hit gear to get while levelling anyway).
---
Your argument is not very good, even using your made-up numbers!
---
Even if you did get an extra 30% damage per Frostbolt, this saves you exactly 1 Frostbolt eg. where it took me 4 to kill a mob, now it takes you three. heyGreat! However, I can cast (say 3) Frostbolts more,
---
Inc. Minmaxer meltdown
---
Chernobyl won't have shit on this thread...
---
True, i don't want it to stay forever but wont lose my shit because of it. I will be too busy playing as a total sack of shit healer for months before i have time to worry things like that.
---
Before 1.12? Yes. After 1.12? Yes. On 1.12? Nope.
---
More seriously, in raids it's just inferior by far but you might be able to convince a guild to let you do it. In PvP it's not all that great but if you have gear and are into it you can still go for it and even feel epic when the RNG is on your side.
---
Go figure, my guy. I just calls it as I sees it. Somehow warriors are the #2 most played class and all of them are Arms/Fury begging for a tank.
---
Viable? Technically sure.
---
But it's bad. It's not even good for pvp. Elemental is better raid or pvp dps spec (actually the best pvp spec). An enhance shaman does poor raid dps and is a free kill in pvp.
---
Agree
---
They're all pretty good and I've played every role in the game before, just never with Warriors or Priests or a Warlock, who are some of the best classes in Classic. And really, even if you love your class, let's be honest: anything to do with WoW is a humongous waste of time.
---
I'm sure, but plenty will play both
---
It's even more frustrating because until max level, a dps warrior can put on a shield, go d-stance, and tank a dungeon just fine. Likewise, a priest who is spec'd shadow can heal just fine. I know, I did both leveling up.
---
Thank you for your answer, I  almost certain I will play Enhancer anyway, the only thing that would really kill the enjoyment would be if I could not find a raidslot because of my spec
---
**ROGUE**
---
Oh I definitely foresee that one happening, but I was specifically mentioning just the priests.
---
In Dungeons yes. In Raids it's just not possible unless you have the ENTIRE raid dedicated to lifting that Prot Pally up enough to be on the same level as an Average Warrior.
---
Yeah I’m not into sci-fi gun games. I played through all of the dragon age games to about 30% completion each and while they were fun I couldn’t fully get into it because I’d always find my way back to wow.
---
I have heard that but wasn't sure how godly it was back then. I'm a decent healer and he typically plays melee so this is probably ideal.
---
Fans that are disappointed can’t stand the fact that other people think it went as well as could be expected and the fan base is just too large to please everyone?
---
At 1080 resolution I reckon a 1050 would probably be good if you're ok with a mix of medium/high 60fps, 1050ti for all high, and a 1060 if you want everything maxed at 100fps+.

Jon Snow apologized for S8, who will apologize for retail?
---
Should’ve mentioned *only* MC for eight months
---
It's something to help define what kind of player you are, and what kind of guild you want to be. Are world buffs mandatory? Do you only care about Dragon head + Heart of Hakkar? Or do you not even bother with that because your raid will probably wipe? 
---
It's an extra dynamic layer thats an important part of the game. I agree with Defcamp and  Melderon often, but disagree that it should be removed from raiding. 
---
I am #no-changes, though I wouldn't be angry or anything if Blizzard cancelled world buffs for the first month of a raid.
---
Oh yeah, I think we can all relate to this one lol
---
There is some truth to the rock paper scissors statement in classic. Some classes will require you to utterly outplay the enemy in order to beat them. Every class has its quirks, but I'd say there is a spectrum. From most depth to easiest in my opinion: Warlock &gt; Hunter &gt; Rogue &gt; Warrior &gt; Shaman &gt; Paladin &gt; Druid &gt; Priest &gt; Mage. Again, tbats my personal opinion. I'm guessing a lot of people would put mage up near the top. Rogue or warrior for carpal tunnel.
---
Disabling CSS via RES or unclicking "Use subreddit style" does nothing, the browser still loads it, it just hides it after.
---
Until you guys have this fixed, you should remove the CSS entirely.
---
Some great enemies too.  Just screw them a few times, and the drama is real.
---
&gt;This quest won't be avaliable in phase 1 so everyone will only get level 45 water
---
Omg. I forgot about that. Months with no lvl 55 water...
---
On a serious note, you'll have a hell of a lot of fun in pvp. You'll range from crazy numbers to white hitting and wanting to rip your hair out.
---
Grinding wont be an issue either.
---
If you arent looking towards being a hardcore progressive raider, most guilds will take an enhancement or two, you've got more chance if you have Nightfall.
---
I really do think the "meta" has changed since 15 years ago and I believe enh will be a lot more viable than it was, if played correctly (along with other class/spec combos).
---
Aside from that, play what you enjoy. Can't get in a raid? create your own pug.
---
I seriously considered it for classic too, I'm going for a resto main though with a lock to grind some pvp ranks, I did play one on a private server and it was great fun.
---
how does more/better gear in expansions not diminish previous content
---
There are discords (https://discord.gg/ByNzer)full of guilds recruiting for vanilla. I don't know if its too soon to commit to anything (probably), but that will be your best bet in finding people on the same page as you.
---
Anything like that is totally against Classic WoW. Gear scaling, gear only working in PvE or PvP. We don't need that. It makes items worthless in many scenarios. The expansions did that and it was awful.
---
Argent dawn friendly
---
Paladins, they are priests that wish they were warriors. All their spells are yellow and look the same. Everything they do just looks so lame and stupid

I just let them die.  I am not wasting my waters.

Consider crafting a good 2h?
---
Mhm that doesn't sound good but doesn't sound too bad either... Just what I thought
---
Yeah, I was just speculating that even the very best guilds will only be half-geared for BWL.
---
Retail=vanilla, my bad
---
Rico!
---
A lot of this is subjective. You'll feel out what you play better on one class more than others and you gotta go with your gut as to what is fun and works for you.  They're all challenging in their own right just in different ways. My wife likes playing melee. Melee is induces dizziness for me, so from my perspect a rogue looks insanely difficult. She looks at me playing a hunter and managing keeping people out of my deadzone, kiting, jousing to wing clip, scatter/feign/trapping as difficult and I'm not saying it's easy but it's easier for me to play than a rogue.
---
That being said, Blizzard said they designed paladins to be easier to play at high level. That doesn't mean that it's EASY though - you still have to be quick to bless of sacrifice before getting polymorphed, heal without getting spell locked by mages and lock pets, etc.
---
So I tend to think Melee is hardest, after it's probably glass cannons being harder than more survivable classes that don't hit as hard. The exception might be a druid which is really carpal tunnel inducing.
---
Not sure that helps you a lot or that I answered your question lol
---
So as an Enhancer, even with good equip I will not be able to do as good as a... let's say Hunter?
---
They were doing it with a modern api that didn't exist in vanilla.  The classic beta was updated a few weeks ago and removed that script since it was gameplay enhancing and not vanilla-like.
---
Is dual Boxing still an option or has blizzard cracked down on that? I was big into dual boxing for leveling and thinking of doing it again.
---
&gt; I didn't say there is little to learn, i said smart people learn fast. But yea we already identified reading comprehension as a problem for you so it is okay. 
---
Yea, you did and you claimed the fact that I've spent a lot of time learning is a negative as I wouldn't have had to if I was smart, the implication being that I should've learned everything by now, so maybe it's not reading comprehension that's my problem, maybe my "problem" is that, unlike you as you've clearly demonstrated, I'm able to utilize logic and thereby understand implications
---
&gt; Maybe next time you can then learn faster like a normal smart person. 
---
Maybe I already am a fast learner?
---
&gt; Can you see that i am creating you almost like a personal plan here how to overcome your problems! Again, glad i could help you.
---
You haven't helped me do anything, all you've done is insult and slander me, not to mention costing a charity money.
---
If you're ganking, then ur goal is to piss off the other player more than total kills.  This is were the druid really out shines a rogue. you wont be doing a 8second stun lock instant kill. its more about moonfire spam and kiting. the longer and more annoying dot dps is 10/10 for ganking.  it just depends on what you really want to do at the end of the day.   
---
frame of reference is watching sodapoppin giggle like a child as he dances around players
---
You could pick up PvP gear by doing PvP. But in a broader sense you're asking us how a hypothetical raid will handle DKP/off-sets. It depends on the guild/raid composition/etc. There's no real answer.
---
So
---
&gt; It's a whole new game compared to Vanilla
---
Which is false. It's exactly Vanilla in it's final form with some time-gated content.
---
Then why didn't he say that? He's just bashing without stating the people he's bashing lol. My bad for misinterpreting though
---
i think there's also something to be said for mid fight heals and reshifting
---
You're a certified asshole
---
30 sec
---
If you plan on tanking as a Warrior as your main spec then by the time you've got enough Tanking gear and a nice 2h to feel you can hold off on PvE and do some PvP you will have accumulated plenty of DPS gear.
---
Your dungeon runs and 10 mans will get you some gear for DPS and in 5 man's you may not even see another plate wearer.
---
Beyond that, if you want to PvP you can do it in Prot or in Arms with Prot gear. You just have to realize you aren't going to be a damage dealer/killer. You would be better off rushing their back rank healers/casters and playing "the nuisance" that the enemy can't afford to ignore.
---
This draws attention, GCD, spells, attacks all off your team and onto you, which gives your team the advantage in that moment.
---
You play the utility/support role until you gather enough gear to actually put out some threat on the front lines.
---
I actually think the 2 hander will be easiest to get since fury warriors want 1 handed weapons
---
the number of people who will be shocked how their now favorite classes play is going to be immense. even those who say they know what to expect will be shocked at the reality.
---
Paladin, because disgusting alliance
---
Not related, but I have a story. 
---
I remember seeing whelp pets and encountered the mobs while questing. 
---
I figured, why don't I kill a few to see if I can possibly get the pet?! 
---
After killing 10, I just gave up and left. When I went to go sell, I realized that I actually looted a whelp pet and didn't even notice!!! Went ahead and sold it for 1.3k. (This was in Cataclysm and others were selling theirs in AH for 3k). Looking back, I wish I just kept it.
---
And you don’t represent the full player base...
---
It’s helping not cause part two of vanillas launch, with people not being able to play for a week or two. They want to get rid of it fast too, stop whining.
---
Fine - if it's on different servers and not mandatory.
---
Keep classic classic.
---
Agreed, I just go for stam/int gear to stack my hp and mana pool while aoe grinding. Especially since damage added is minimal on aoe spells
---
Lol I love these posts
---
That's why you just never log out after a mage gives you water
---
Hard to believe someone was wrong on the internet
---
He’s not asking what system to use he’s asking what to use to keep up with it
---
Warrior doesnt look intresting from the outside, but doing those big crits and hearing that deep wound sound feels pretty satisfying actually :D
---
Saying you need the same amount of frostbolts only makes sense if you always attack something with the exact same hp, and if frostbolt did a exact amount of damage. Seeing as both of those things are not true, there's no breakpoint for frostbolt amount to kill something, so you actually have no idea at all if +6 damage is better or worse than +10 int.  
---
You'd have to work out how much +10 int saved you in recovery time over 15 minutes of grinding, and compare it to how much +6 damage saved you in kill time.  
---
I mean it's very obvious +25 damage would be far better than +10 int. But would +20, or +15, or +10? Obviously +dmg is worth some amount of +int but no one seems to know what it is.  
---
The idea that it's *only good if you stack* has no actual merit though.
---
I made my priest a night elf for this reason. I would shadow meld and res after. The party would learn fast.
---
My bad was talking about Spinal Reaper dunno why my priest brain went to BRE.
---
BWL onwards perhaps. You'll find most warriors will go arms and maybe a few 2h fury, but 1h fury is so hit dependant its not partularly common until the later phases, in my opinion
---
Why would i stay around and wipe for hours on end to get gear that doesn't progress my character? Feels like an arbitrary hindrance just so i can continue to raid other useless raids. The whole reason why people wanted to progress through tiers was so they could be able to style on others and become powerful.
---
Don't listen to this guy, he barely knows how to read.
---
If you group is smart they just let the tank die.
---
Wont this slow down my leveling considering the lost point in enhancement while im questing?
---
Top- fuck tbc - if they do it - they should make tbc servers and anyone that wants to play tbc MUST transfer their character off of Classic and to the tbc server.
---
Then we'll see who is willing to actually play tbc.
---
Sounds great I hope you will have a lot of fun!
---
I don't want to play super hardcore and I think that Enhancer could still be a viable choice. Thanks for your opinion!
---
multishot does WAY MORE damage than arcane shot
---
The intent of bringing back WoW vanilla is to experience the game again not to make changes just because you think it should be done. Don't like don't play it, go back to Bfa tyvm
---
Sometimes when every group you run with is terrible you manage to convince yourself that drastic measures are a good idea to avoid wiping.
---
In other words, git gud.
---
Normally I have styles turned off. I turned this one on and the memory usage is fine with Firefox Quantum 67.0.1. 21.6 MB on this tab.

Advice: Race and class is all BS.
---
You can do whatever you want - if you stick to your guns and continue to learn - you’ll beat 95% of the people you fight in PvP.
---
Some may be harder to learn with - but it is all a process.
---
Just because Orcs have 25% stun resist racial - doesn’t mean your human warrior with no equivalent racial can’t run into some group of clothies and overpower their limbs off.
---
People, especially advanced players, get stuck on those advantages and skip their actual preferred selection for the best advantage.
---
Interesting, that doesn't sound good at all haha
---
just reserve gear when literally everybody is looking for a tank to run their preBis 5 mans
---
FOR THE HORDE
---
Happy cake day my druid friend.
---
Mediocre is an interesting way to say dogshit.
---
Not too worried about acquiring dungeon gear. It’s raid gear that will be tougher to get
---
False. 
---
Other healers are competition, my only friends are warriors who peel for me in pvp
---
Pick different gathering professions while leveling together. You can always drop it later.
---
I'll just decline, if you want me in the group might as well explain what for
---
Answer this:
---
*Does it cost Blizzard more than the absolute minimum amount of money to develop to keep Classic players happy until they figure out a way to convert them to Retail?*
---
If the answer is yes, it isn't happening.
---
No, as a tank your important and your friends will always look after you as your more sought after than even healers!
---
I’m definitely a casual player so I’m going to stick with whatever pleases my eyes and heart &lt;3
---
Yes, I think that's a fair assumption. There's going to be a lot of warriors, and they'll get a lot of raid spots. If you're the MT or 2nd tank you're gonna get gifted basically all the tanking gear, and all the dps gear will be gobbled up by the line of fury warriors.
---
Yea this is an issue on priest.  Pws dominates in pvp for most of vanilla but by aq and naxx melee 1shot it consistently and force you to gear more and more defensively to survive.
---
Either add content like zones, bgs, that give rewards that have no power gain/spike or it's a "no changes" from me
---
if only there were different levels of a spell to cast
---
If you would be fast learner or logic wouldn't be a problem for you we wouldn't have this conversation at all. Sure it can sometimes feel that person isn't helping you because he don't help you the way you think would be best. But sometimes you are toi blind for your problems and mistakes that it takes a other person who can tell you what to do. So you are welcome. I have helped you to identify at least a half dozen problems you need to start focusing now. Now it might feel like insulting but you will thank me later. Glad i could help.
---
The boring gameplay is rewarded in BWL with the most beautiful set ever produced in this game, Judgement :D

Oh, fuck off. They're bored because they're playing level 58 dummy characters that mean nothing. Stop trying to make it into a 1.12 thing.

---
I think it's a good idea for Classic+ but there should be a little of a power increase too just so you have some sort of progression of your character. Maybe it'll take five tiers to get a power increase equal to what you used to get from one tier.
---
if every group you run with is terrible then you should indeed git gud. this guy was specially saying he doesn't heal the tank if he's below 50% mana and the tank pulls. he's a bad healer
---
Why would mages get taxed? They are not a hybrid class they are specialized in DPS.
---
In vanilla not everything is raiding, if you want to feel really strong as one of the hybrids, just play PvP.
---
Sure not all classes are equal and not everything is balanced but the game is fun. Every class is needed for raiding so no matter what you start with you can raid, not every spec but every class which should be enough.
---
If someone really wants to be in a good guild and be a balance druid, there are tons of options. Make your own guild or be an officer in a guild with tons of friends where it's accapted that you are memeing. Bad specs are not as bad as you make them out to be, if you give 4 mages 3% crit and also provide innervate for healers, sure balance is not optimal but having one in a 40 man raid is not the end of the world since raids are laughably easy up until mid AQ.
---
There are vanilla screenshots of oomkins at C'thun kills. I killed C'thun back in Vanilla and we did have a feral druid and an oomkin as well.
---
I'm going to be playing a warlock but I would be really mad if they changed the balance of the game and made warlocks do as much damage as mages. I want to play a lock to support with HS SS Summons and later decent DPS but still not as good as a mage. Mage exists to be the top ranged DPS. I won't be crying that destro or demo is not viable for raids, I'll play SM Ruin or DS Ruin it's all just shadow bolt spam anyways and spec something else when we have the raid on farm and go PvP.
---
You can do the exact same thing as a druid. Heal until you have the raid on farm then spec balance and you can heal as a balance druid on farm runs easily and go PvP or whatever you want to do as an oomkin.
---
I know - I'm planning on casually playing Tues-Thurs then taking Fri and Mon off to enjoy a long weekend full of Classic.
---
&gt;No, *because you still have to cast the same amount of frostbolts to kill something* or *intellect lets you cast more frostbolts* pseudo-maths reasons are not real reasons.
---
What the hell does qualify as a reason then? Do you find problem with the pseudo math? If you desire actual math, there's none because the problem isn't uniform.
---
Some mobs have more health than others. The health:damage curve in general changes as you level. The current rank of your Frostbolt relative to your level greatly affects the equations as well (i.e. upon getting a new rank, you may need 3 frostbolts, but 1 level from a new rank you may need 5).
---
In the end you cannot give any sort of mathematical proof that one method is superior to the other. Even running an actual experiment with logging time is heavily biased depending on farming spot, level, etc. as all of that affects the question of whether or not running +damage gear will actually cut down on a Frostbolt cast or not.
---
The only thing that is certain is that there are cutoff points for +damage, and that's what people refer to when they say stacking +damage. If all of your +damage doesn't allow you to cut down on a spell cast, then the stat is worthless (might save you a single wand shot I guess).
---
So it's not that +80 to +100 is better than +0 to +20. That's not true. But if +90 is what you need to cut down on a single cast, then +90 is what you want. The problem is that this question isn't uniform. There is no magic number that you should meet. You can only make assumptions as to whether your amount of spell damage is really saving you anything.
---
IMO, go with +stat gear. It's more reliable and predictable, and will help you more in PvP as well. But if you want to roll with +damage gear, go for it. But if you're looking for the 'objectively superior build', then you're out of luck, as such a thing is impossible to determine and would at best only hold for a subset of mobs at a certain level range.
---
If they are going to do ANYTHING with new content for Classic. I'd want it to be something CLASSIC oriented.
---
Heroic 5 Man's for level 60's (Same gear skins but perhaps itemized for level 60 hybrid/offspecs)
---
Scarlet Crusade or Defias Brotherhood Raid
---
hey man you wana be a pussy about it go rp

---
Or they can eat mage food aswell. Faster pulls like that.
---
I don't see why there is a concern about them in vanilla. The content isn't difficult to begin with. If people want to grind out all the world buffs to help them with it why does it matter? Just like back in Vanilla most people are not going to be stacking up world buffs for raids. What is more likely to happen is someone getting one or two world buffs which is something they very well could have done in vanilla and removing that would be damaging the vanilla experience for them.
---
Well consider that you only get 1 piece of raid gear a week if you're lucky. 40 man raids.
---
theres always the pvp set you can go for
---
nobody really need those beefy 2handers for pve anyways, so i don't see why tanks should be at a disadvantage when rolling for pvp gear tbh. ultimately its up to your guild who is allowed for what
---
I know I said this to you before in a different thread but I'd rather the Worgen story go in a different direction than towards Worgen as a playable race.

You know, it's pretty evident that your motivation is not helping anyone.

You're literally taking money from charity just so you could continue insulting me, that's pretty sad tbh, though I'm guessing the reason you did that wasn't related to neither the charity, nor to spite me, more because you've been talking out of your ass.

Im kinda new, what was the standard?
---
Thank you for the advice
---
I'll take a look
---
LOL. Seems a bit hypocritical but i guess?
---
It will be very difficult to find raids that accapt you and it's the worst spec for PvP but it's still okay just too much RNG.
---
Oh I see. Cool!
---
I did kinda like that at level 10 when you chose you obtained a 'key ability' for that spec.

Note the quote. 
---
Fear of it being imported inaccurately? Reasonable.

A conspiracy in which the world's top game designers try to stealth remove a beloved feature under the nose of an extremely watchful consumer? Loony.

Make priest friends so you can bitch to each other about everyone taking your drops.
---
With loot list, you relly on your own research. You can't blame someone else for loot distribution.
---
Because of the debuff limit, is it just not viable to raid as an afliction lock?

Also, how is the debuff limit managed? Do new debuffs push of the oldest one or replace the newest one or just not apply?

Yeah seriously, fuck rogues in the face

Thats awesome man! Thank you very much for that info, that will help a lot. Getting that FPS out of a 2gb GPU is pretty impressive!
---
Back during vanilla I played both alliance and horde. Definitely enjoyed horde a lot more
---
This.
---
All 3 axes are incredible in Classic.
---
NF and Annihilator especially. If you need to know why here's a good video explaining...
---
https://youtu.be/VLe0U4KbavE
---
Yup, get used to that /oom emote
---
We should make something like SS of the day on this sub
---
Same here...my guild is rolling horde for classic. I have been a paladin since the pre vanilla beta as my main. Over 15 years... I can't change now. Lol
---
Is going with two gathering professions at launch really still the best way to make money while leveling? With the knowledge of it that exists now, it seems like there might be too many folks doing this.
---
I'm not adverse to time sinks for actual content, wasting time getting buffs when everyone could've been in the raid and clearing trash/bosses seems like a huge waste. I played vanilla, it was cool when you knew someone was turning in an onyxia head or something on raid day but we didn't go out of our way to make sure it happened just to do raids. Nor get all the other buffs. I'm not saying get rid of them, I'm saying it shouldn't skew the community perception to a point where everyone and their mother thinks these things are required to raid from the get go.
---
I guess as prot you can carry flags and guard the closest base to the entrance in AB pretty effectively
---
Crazy, or efficient. 
---
Time is money, friend
---
YICKKKYIICCKKKKGGGGYIKGG
---
Good answer 10/10
---
Really just any reason to group people up and have them compete against each other.
---
Ha, yeh. I'm the same way.
---
that's a big yikes from me
---
Priests know what im talking about :D
---
But you actually had to work for the OP weapons. You can go months of killing a boss without seeing the drop you want and then you need to roll against 40 people. Compared to retail where everything is RNG. If someone gets a sick Titanforge odds are they can't even trade it because how personal loot works.
---

---
It is easier to splitraid Ony than Ragnaros, even if you don't use the strat of having 90% of the raid hearth out when she's at 1% health so only a few people get locked to that ID.
---
Just tried the balance/resto drud on pserver without addons/macros 😀 i had no idea what i am doing but i guess it was bad i mesn my dmg output and without addons was hard to folkow who to heal😀 any the healing touch is so sloow so i gues that is used only with ns only
---
You must not play Mage or Warlock.
---
in classic, if you spec deep into arcane, your main spells will still be fire or frost depending on your leftover points
---
arcane only has arcane missiles which is situational for pvp and garbage for pve
---
Alright doesn't sound too good to be honest
---
For now it's only vanilla WoW that's being released.
---
They literally said they already plan to lmao
---
So I hope you're shocked.
---
Depends on what type of raid you're looking for.
---
Hardcore guilds will definately not allow enhancement. You will need to find a more casual guild where they allow you to do that. Most of the early raids are incredibly easy so it shouldn't be a problem, mid AQ40 to Naxx is where having to carry the bad specs can be a bit of a problem.
---
Getting into a pug will be probably near impossible depending on realm population because the only legitimate reason to take an enhancement shaman is that there is no one else and it's better than nothing but if the RL has a choice between enhancement shaman or a rogue/warrior/mage/warlock whatever good dps class they will obviously pick them.
---
Assuming classic will be very popular it should be easy to find a guild that fits you so if you really enjoy enhancement go for it.
---
Dude that spell is not even in the game
---
Enh Shamans are boring as fuck to play. Just so you know there is nothing fun except when you do get crits wind fury procs. Which is not that often. Its super boring. Nothing to have wet dreams about.
---
Hunter. Really don't want to deal with a Pet and always stocking up on Arrows.
---
There's also something strangely satisfying being the everyman, armed with nothing more than a pointy stick, who is keeping up with all those superpowered monsters around him by sheer force of will and skill.
---
Definitely warrior. You'll have a dungeon and pvp healer tank combo
---
What the hell
---
MC will probably be the hardest raid in the game since it's the first.
---
Every other raid will be cleared on day 1.
---
cannot... unsee....
---
You’re under the impression that
---
1. Blizzard plans on spending a single dime on new content for Classic.
---
2. The promise of Classic is permanent.
---
Browse via new reddit or use a different browser. I cannot solve it if I cannot recreate the issue. None of the CSS developers can recreate the issue. 
---
I have said that we will try to rewrite the entire code, hoping that something optimizes and magically fixes it.
---
&gt;It usually goes to ret pallys or shamans cause they want it for pvp
---
Maybe this is true on private servers, but on my old vanilla server every hand of rag was on a warrior, every ashkandi was on warrior, except one guild got a ton to drop so hunters started getting them.  The server 2nd dark edge went to a pve resto/ pvp enhance shaman via dkp bidding and it was a scandal, with the rest of the server making fun of them.  The guild had several active pvp warriors who felt cheated.  The guild abandoned dkp in naxx because of it.
---
Mages and Wlocks both benefit from this, both will use over half their mana when they respawn in BG's, but Priests are even worst
---
Yes. Really any point in AB as long as you're adjacent to one your team owns.
---
If you have Engineering and Shield Slam you can be a healers/casters nightmare if they don't deal with you. 
---
Watch your rogues and see who they are targeting in the back ranks and support them.
---
 The playstyle as Prot is to understand that you're built to take more damage than your teammates so every time the enemy attacks you instead of them they are wasting their damage and your teammates are effectively not losing as much health in engagements.
---
I really do think its a sub-par spec for raiding but if you find the right guild it shouldn't matter too much. Good luck
---
&gt; I agree with added content, new zones or dungeons in classic style, as long as they do not change in any way the classic experience
---
This is literally an oxymoron.
---
Adding content that wasn't a part of the original design will always affect that earlier content, usually negatively, because of scope, balance and distorted incentivization.
---
Arcane blast wasn’t a thing. Going deep arcane, you are still going to spam either frost bolt or fireball
---
Thanks for the heads up!
---
Hunters should have always had energy.
---
I am! Can you link the article, blue post or video?
---
It wont be bfa for ever so your whole theory is wrong
---
Buy Cat
---
Speak for yourself. My guild wasn't hardcore but we still had world buffs during progression because it was such a small chore to get them but they helped with progression immensely.
---
Paladin warlock is literally god tier. refer to kargoz on youtube
---
Yeah, but it's also important to note that even with BWL out you'll still be going back to MC.
---
It seems like people are still in the BfA mindset.
---
Well it is you who keep sending messages. I literally said like 10 posts ago that don't write to me, write to Google. So no, i don't want to continue insulting anyone, you keep messaging me. Maybe we need to add problems in your short term memory also to the list. Once again, i helped you to identify a problem you might have. I start to feel that you are ungrateful of my help. I also can't really be blamed if you are unable to give money to charity without my help. But don't worry, i can do it myself. What the heck, lets make it 40€ instead of 20.
---
Agreed
---
Giving freedom to warriors and healing them is the fastest way to kill anyone as a paladin.
---
Pretty sure it won’t be the only thing they miss though. Mage Tables? Soulwells?
---
Ret wins pvp by outlasting their opponents, not by out damaging them.
---
"Arcane dps" doesn't really exist in that way in Classic. The arcane pve spec in Classic is frost; you essentially put points in Arcane until you get PoM/AP, then put the rest in frost &amp; spam frostbolt to dps. 
---
The only spells dealing arcane damage are Arcane Missiles &amp; Arcane Explosion. While AE is useful for aoe damage, arcane missiles is essentially a dead spell (it might have niche pvp uses, such as if you get locked out of your other spell classes or something).
---
\&gt; World buffs in raids were in Classic, therefore they should not be removed 
---
Blizzard already did a lot of changes tho, so not really slid argument. 
---
\&gt; So how can the content be trivial if there's a risk of dying 
---
YIKES, if 1 of 40 raiders died its not a trivial content? As a pservers raider i would say - vanilla pve is stupidly ez. And its will be easier in classic tho. Pretty sure atleast 90% or raiders agree with video, wbuffs so much wrong and unhealthy for game
---
Hunters are really bad DPS they are there because of tranq shot. 
---
Enhancement is one of the weakest dps specs you will most likely use Nightfall to buff casters and provide totems. Even if you severely outgear people you will struggle to keep up with other PvE dps.
---
Actually I do. I was nominated by blizzard to speak on behalf of 51% of paying subscribers
---
You should do a poll on how many people actually use your CSS. And then delete it when you realize it’s basically no one.
---
You forgot Star Belt https://classicdb.ch/?item=4329
---
For sure. I wouldv rolled hunter considering I had a 60 hunter, 49, 39, 29, and 19 twink hunters. I tried it on a Pserver and thank God, it was awful
---
Thanks alot for taking your time writing this!
---
How so?
---
It's in the interview most likely that was posted above. Or in literally any interview.
---
Unironically discovering that Theme Park MMOs **in the grand scheme of things** are actually not as fulfilling in their endgame as other types of MMOs, like Sandboxes.
---
&gt;  Once again, i helped you to identify a problem you might have. 
---
No, you did not, you asserted I have a problem, yet refuse to back up that assertion with anything.
---
&gt; But don't worry, i can do it myself. What the heck, lets make it 40€ instead of 20.
---
Receipt?
---
I know, they suck. I'm just saying the selfish part. I don't agree. If the group is willing to take the pally, it isn't that selfish. As long as u aren't strongholding your guild to take you, that's your decision. You may have a harder time getting a group, but if one wants you, that's their decision.
---
I miss the days of original thought. Like Barrens chat for example.
---
Prepare by remodeling/decorating your game room.
---
If it takes you over 2 months to get 60...
---
As a Warrior main myself.... Battle Shout = The Nightmare. 
---
2 min buff that requires rage to use.
---
60 on day one is impossible. The first feasible raid reset is Sept 3rd.
---
Just keep a set of int gear on you and you wont have any issues until you start getting to the sunken temple range dungeons.
---
For getting healing gear youll start at the bottom of the barrel dungeons and work your way up. Probably BRD and move your way through tougher dungeons as you get healing pieces.
---
I think a shorter P1 is reasonable, since P2 doesn't add much additional raid content but it does add Honor, which players are going to want to start grinding once they get bored with clearing MC/Ony.
---
In single target combat you shouldn't be taking any damage anyway. The extra dps and shorter time/kill outweighs the extra time spent drinking. The quicker you kill a mob the faster you start ticking up your mana with the 5 second rule. Even just walking between mob pulls these extra seconds of regen add up.
---
Hunter, but not because I don't want to play one but because I remember how goddamn hard it was for my hunter friends to get groups. 
---
A close second would be warlock due to shard farming.
---
You know what's great about it though, you can disable the CSS or just not visit the subreddit.
---
Judging by your numerous warnings on your account, you won't have to worry about it too much longer before the ban eventually forces you out.
---
&gt; Barrens chat
---
&gt; Original Thought
---
Choose one
---
The only noticeable delay is putting off the 2h talent, but pro-tip, low level staves do a lot of damage. The crescent staff from WC will last you till SM when you can grab the ravager.
---
You can definitely pug at least Onyxia and in phase 4 ZG. MC is doable as well assuming your pug group is decently geared and can understand basic mechanics.
---
Joining a big social guild will be a massive asset in casual raiding. Any raiding guild will also likely have alt/casual member runs in which you'll be able to tag along.
---
You dont make a mage table or soulwell every respawn lol, do you understand what this buff is? This the few second period in BG's were you are able to buff your self without a mana cost. In retail everytime you buff your self you use 50-80% of your mana and have to drink every single time :D not sure how mage table and soulwell is related
---
Raids will be pugged eventually. They were in vanilla, they are on pservers, they will be in classic.
---
If you’re only play time is on weekends it will take longer (real life time) to see em but will definitely be doable in time.
---
 Horizontal Progression through Set Bonuses
---
If there were new dungeons and T1, T2, T3 raids that dropped gear with new set bonuses, would that allow for enough customization? Some of the Molten Core sets offer pretty good set bonuses, and I wonder if set bonuses could be a way to offset the stat increases that T3 gear offers for example. If there was new Tier 2 raid similar to Blackwing Lair, it could drop new set bonuses that changed the way certain talents worked. (ex. T2 mage set Spellweave Regalia (5) Set Bonus Tier %chance Pyroblast hits multiple targets. This could make less viable specs more viable. If you wanted certain boosts to Ret or Boomkin, you could farm the new raid for the set. The issues with the vertical raid progression is that if attribute increases are all that matter, then higher tier drop gear is clearly better.

Is holy pally pvp not a thing in classic ??
---
No now your reading it wrong I said if you pull below 50% I MIGHT not heal you.  It’s a decision I have to make.  Because wiping is NOT in the groups best interest. Letting them die and res them takes 2min instead of 15min corps run.  Save 13min.  
---
The picture clearly stated pulling at OOM meaning that I’m &lt;10% mana.  Even trying to heal a pug at that point is useless and would result in a wipe. 
---
More often then not I didn’t take the wipe card why because I did a faulty decision resulting in a wipe. 
---
I do not speak or running 5mans in t2+ gear because that’s a totally different ballgame when your out gearing content and have It on farm.  
---
Most often in pugs in 5man your tank might be Arms spec and don’t have access to great gear this will drain your mana quicker.  
---
I’m not saying you should always wipe a group but if it’s a lost cause even to start with NE got a racial option to save 12min for the group.  
---
If your not using all the tools at your disposal your doing it wrong.  
---
To clarify the 50% is what I tell the tank it’s easy half full.  If below mark i need to make a fast decision when the pulls come if it’s a do or die situation. 
---
You have to weight in a lot of things like group comp. tank status dps abilities.  Cc abilities etc.  Trust me do I think we got a chance we are going to try. But
---
Even trying when I’m at 10% is a waste of my And groups time.
---
This. On horde, nothing is funnier than meeting a retnub who thinks he will beat anyone. Meeting a duo of support/healing pally and a warrior in bg's, on the other hand, is damn scary.
---
Which is ironically how some people felt about PvE back in 2.0.
---
I've been going through old Arstechnica posts by WoW players during Vanilla/TBC, just to get an understanding of what players hated about the game. This one struck me as super interesting:
---
&gt; “IMO what killed Wow were the patches that added new 40 man dungeons, thus making gear the only way to progress in the game. BWL, AQ and Naxx are just some of the things I never visited as a long-time WoW player, because of my real life schedule and were added only cause the hardcore players whined and moaned about it.”
---
Literally can not find anything official where it’s confirmed I would genuinely love you link me the official post.
---
Ultimately no. You could lvl holy but there is no point. You can still heal just fine as ret even in dungeons as long as you have the gear with the needed stats.
---
1 word: lolret.
---
It's still worth for sure. Have a bank alt that you can mail it all to. 
---
If the prices are bad, then you can still use those materials to level crafting professions at 60.
---
In BGs you really have to pick your battles. Sometimes you may have to just unload your opener and stun on someone and then sit back and assist someone else with flash of light and let them finish them off.
---
Where you really shine is 1v1 scenarios with people. Which again means picking your battles. I hate ever suggesting this to anyone but, fight people on the road in AB and see if you can draw an important players attention, because you can waste people's time as a Paladin and hold your own against all classes 1v1.
---
In the open world you will give a lot of people a headache as when played right you 'just won't die'. With a good DMG 2h you can really hurt people.
---
Really it's about knowing your limitations vs certain classes and your strengths vs others. Properly using blessing of freedom and repentance at the right times vs mages can literally make some of them freeze up(no pun intended) as they aren't used to kiting not working
---
it's so easy to say "I want new content but I don't want it to change classic", etc. etc.
---
how are you going to do that
---
How many humans do you know IRL wearing plate armor and swinging a big fat twohanded swoard?
---
This is exactly what I envision. I feel a lot of the talk on this sub tends to gloss over just how long it takes to get the drops you want when bosses are only dropping 2 items and there are 40 people in the raid. And for classes that were well represented in raids, it would still take months to get the pieces you want even if you’re lucky enough to see them drop almost every week
---
2 handed weapons is a talent for shamans (enhancement)
---
PVP : yes
---
Pve: better get some real good friends
---
Yeah, obviously.. I literally said.
---
&gt;Obviously, it's not possible but.
---
holy shit
---
i WONT flame anyone in this post
---
im not toxic
---
I WONT
---
By the time you get to the point where you're able to raid, MC/ony (and probably BWL) will be on farm for nearly everyone. At that point all the prep "required" won't be necessary. The main problem would be finding a guild that suits your times.
---
Yup, it's such a shame Blizzard stupidly decided to pursue such a terrible game design for their mmo through TBC and WotlK. What a mistake that was! Oh boy, all those brilliant sandbox MMOs of the 2000s really laughed all the way to the bank.
---
If you look at it kind of literally it really is kinda true. They ran out of content in GoT and had to make it up -- Wow also lost people like Metzen who could really drive the path of the story.
---
Are you retarded?
---
&gt; I've been seeing a lot of conflicting answers on whether or not Paladins can do respectable damage in world PvP?
---
This is because a lot of playstyles come from p-servers. Unfortunately the easy to exploit “reck-bomb” will not be available in Classic, so that completely destroys the only kind of Ret spec that was viable (even if it was still iffy / meme-y as fuck.)
---
Its in no way shape or form confirmed that TBC will be re-released, they said its a possibility, but they said the same thing about new content for Classic...
---
&gt; I've raided in top 20 world wide progression guilds using loot council and shit like that never happened.
---
Must have been Mars in that case if the 7th worst mage in the guild got as much gear as literally anyone else.
---
What class should I play - druid or paladin, or something else?
---
I'll be a casual player because of work and other irl commitments, so I don't care about quick progression but I'd like to get to do the classic raids eventually. I've especially enjoyed raiding as a healer in the past, but also enjoy tanking.
---
Essentially I'd like to make myself as useful as possible with as few hours spent as possible. Any input would be much appreciated!
---
Two gathering is always your gathering mate to what your main profession will be, and skinning. Skinning is ultimately there just to vendor until mid levels. The AH will be too flooded to bother at the start.
---
Apparently. Please link a single official anything so I can end my retarded life
---
Oh I agree with that. I just mean while you're being grateful that your guild is supporting you in playing a Prot Pally just be aware that 40 people are having to adjust just so you can tank.
---
Yeah, pretty much. /Imperial Guard player
---
How is it common sense to know what Blizzard intended players to do with the world buffs that they programmed into the game?
---
And don’t forget, if you respec you will lose your wep skill!
---
It's not even one day, it's 14 hours.
---
That's when you have to do it the most my man. When you have nothing better consistent regen inbetween downtime keeps it minimal. The real hell is going to be 50+ish when you don't have access to the max rank water. 
---
I spent gold on the Argent Dawn food / drink til I was pre-raid BiS (Stupid me..)
---
Why dude without buffs should get gear, if his impact is significantly lower?
---
Yeah I watched it. I know it is better for leveling but also wanna pick based on pvp combo at 60.
---
Shockadin
---
Thanks, that’s a great example. Until the recent layering issues, this also seemed like a pserver-exclusive strategy that would fizzle out in Classic due to the non-Blizz-like, overly accelerated respawn times on black lotus. Because of their increased rarity, I think the flask meta will take a big hit in Classic, and will kind of rightfully “belong” to only the most hardcore guilds.
---
Worrld buffs are reason to pvp outside the raid.
---
No kidding.   
---
If you were a Disc Dwarf Priest you were casting Fort, Spirit, Shadow Prot, Inner fire, and Fear Ward. Without that buff, you'd likely have to sit and drink. It was a god send.    
---
Kind of a shame about the reagent cost on Prayer of Spirit/Fort, because I would have recast that for everyone in range but 9s/ea adds up.
---
Just play bfa dude. Seriously you'll hurt yourself playing classic.
---
You have to literally be the biggest retard I've seen on this subreddit.
---
wtf
---
Doesn’t matter how many people do skinning. Mining and herbs will be tough in lower level zones. But vendoring skins is the way to go for early gold.
---
&gt;the quest for the level 55 water is in Dire Maul. If that dungeon isn't available on release I assume the quest wont be available either? 
---
Right.
---
Afflic lock is pretty much dead for raiding. At best, your raid might let 3 nightfall warlocks have a corruption on the boss. My guild only has one corruption spot for the improved imp lock.
---
Both are great combos. Let your partner choose whatever they want to play most. A warrior with a pocket healer would have no downtime while leveling.
---
But honestly, it's the same way with a lock. I dual boxed my pally and a lock and that worked out really smooth.
---
Because you said it's the only thing you'll miss.
---
Gl to say that after getting vaels bombs pushing ranked
---
Multi shot does a lot of damage, it’s cool down also matches the cool down of Furious Howl (wolf ability) so you can boost the damage more every time. Also arcane shot and aimed shot share the same cool down, so you have to choose one to use, and 99% of the time you’ll use aimed shot over arcane shot
---
He was probably rocking 31 enhancement and the rest in elemental.

get ready to face the organized premades if you chose to roll on one of servers our twinking community 19s 29s 39s go to from whole discord crew ;) so you better think a bit this time that those enemies are not pugs like 60s

Or the sub could just have some competent developers volunteer.
---
Wasn't there talk about layering staying until phase 2?
---
Already tons of changes lol
---
im amazed at the comments clearly not seeing the humor tag.  This made me laugh and go "yup thats what it feels like as a horde player"  
---
its perfect when you consider the lore that the orcs invaded not too long ago (in comparison with how long humans and dwarfs have had.) The 'tribal' feel of the horde is amazing
---
I definitely get the negatives and why it was restricted.  80 yards is kind of ridiculous in WSG. Breaking the habit of using nameplates for information after these years after classic will be a challenge.
---
It was just a lot of parallel independent thought around swords and wives.
---
https://forum.nostalrius.org/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=1044 This forum thread on dot prioritization might help
---
There's no evidence you're not a noob either. Your point?
---
It depends on the raid comp, but you could have 1-2 Warlocks as Affliction but they can only use Corruption with the normal curse slots. There is a build for this but it's questionable (I've seen arguments both ways) as to if it's better than the standard  Demo build. However, the Affliction build is pretty good for pvp so it'll save respec costs.
---
In reality a 1.2 cat isn't much worse and you can get 1.0 bats once zg releases. Only problem with bat is it can't prowl if you're doing shadowmeld stuff l as a NE.
---
My worst memory was of a specific night elf hunter named Hydrofox. They were so geared compared to me at the time since I'd only really been in a mix of BWL/ZG/AQ20 gear as a mage and they were rocking full AQ40... They would frequently one-twoshot me.
---
Receipt? Yes, you get receipt if you make payment transaction. I think that was the first word from you that made any sense. At least that is a start. I am really glad that i could help you but soon you have to start writing to someone else because i need to sleep. Hope you will find the strenght in you to overcome all the problems in your life.
---
I think people are vastly underestimating the time it's going to take for even dedicated PvPers to get their PvP gear equipped.
---
Weeks AFTER Phase 2 starts. By then a lot of people will be in MC/Only gear.
---
This is spot on, guy above you is way oversimplifying and just plainly wrong. 
---
&gt; PvE servers are for people who don't care for ganks and basically nothing else. 
---
Implies there are no fights you could be jumped and win, simply impossible not to get ganked with your own skill... 
---
&gt; PvE still has all the PvP experience minus the constant corpse camping. 
---
Can you remove a player across faction farming the same mobs if they are not PvP? no. 
---
The two arguments, are like saying the earth is flat because it looks flat 
---
The only actual argument is = "I don't like PvP" which is ok, but to be purposely obtuse to make it a point is just disappointing to see.
---
Here's the thing. If you are clearing a shit load of bosses with world buffs, the content is on farm already. If you are doing progression, you are going to instantly lose your world buffs on half the raid if not all of it.  You gear out people who consistently show up. That is how you run a successful guild. You can slightly reward those who are the best with first priority on certain items, but you don't just look at the dps charts and say, "welp you did 4% less damage than that guy so no gear for you."
---
You can also summon yourself, unless my memory is truly faulty.

Wasting 2h every raid and randomly die isnt really effort. U already can buy 500g  consumes for raid, which show ur effort, it seems u never saw a buffed guild wasting buffs. Most depressing and toxic shit ever
---
I see what you are saying
---
Yes layering until phase 2 - most players will take 20+ days to hit 60 phase 1 only lasts 4-7 weeks.
---
Fair enough, skimmed over that.
---
this shop kills me.. so simple and perfect
---
in a 1v1 a geared spriest is absolutely the worst
---
&gt; Receipt? Yes, you get receipt if you make payment transaction. I think that was the first word from you that made any sense. At
---
I meant show me the receipt or it will be pretty evident you're just talking out of your ass again.
---
Definitely not a clear majority. The fact that the split is basically 50/50 just goes to show how contentious of a topic this is right now.
---
spell power isnt worth it, unless you can get tons of it, since you still have to cast 4 or 5 spells to kill, if you dont have enought spell power, to get 1 "bonus" spell in 4 spells its not wroth it.
---
Woonmalk
---
It wasnt related to me.
---
But honestly leveling is not that fast like in retail. I think many people will play under 10 hours per week so getting to 60 will take much time.
---
Look,there are so many older players returning to classic which have family and career and played vanilla as teenager, u can read 7 threads of this per day.
---
Wrong, why people say anything without actual expierence?
---
This is awesome dude. Love players like you 💙
---
Banjo-Kazooie is always great material, love it.

You aren't only casting frost spells when leveling btw...

Blink, fire blast, Mana shield, polymorph are spells you will constantly use

Thanks for the reply. I also thought about weighting the categories. I’m not sure there is much value in joining forces since the values are based on my personal preferences. That’s also why I don’t need to split by build since I only factored In the variant that suits my playstyle. I just wanted to provoke some thoughts, maybe I forgot an aspect ;) Maybe making a template where people can fill in their own weights based on preference could be interesting.
---
im not an expert on warrior gear, but how much of the mc/ony gear is actually useful in pvp? he can get T1 because its pretty much tank gear

Have you ever played Vanilla? 
---
Considering on average it will take about 6 days time played to hit 60 you're looking at 144 hours.
---
(Even if you can pull the fastest time ever 3 days and 22 hours you're still looking at 94 hours)
---
Which means you will need to play 2.4 hours a day every single day for 2 months straight to hit lvl cap. 
---
So while some of us are going to put in mega 12+ hours a day I would say that taking 2 months to hit 60 is totally fine.
---
Yeah maybe I will refine the template with separate dps hps columns
---
Character progression while leveling....what is this? A fucking MMO?
---
I think it has more to do with being stuck on WoW all day, every day, since the beta started than it does with AV.
---
I'd get right fucking flat with any game if I played it that much.
---
With content rolling out in phases, will early level 60 endgame raids and gear become obsolete by the later phases?
---
Although, this is a better problem to have of the two.
---
This isn't how it's working in the beta. I don't know enough information about if/when Blizzard changed it, but I reported it. Cdew says it's not a bug.
---
&gt; Blizzard stupidly decided to pursue such a terrible game design for their mmo through TBC and WotlK.
---
I get that you're being sarcastic, but there's flaws in measuring design as a product of it's temporary popularity. Sure, the playerbase might not notice it two expansions in, but six expansions in, with their individual level increases and disconnected zones stacked on top of each other, and it becomes obvious that this is *bad game design* that [is finally going to be overhauled.](https://www.pcgamesn.com/world-of-warcraft/level-squish)
---
Regardless, size of audience during a particular decade is a difficult metric to go by because it never exists in a vacuum. 
---
* How did increasing expansions affect the original popularity of a Theme Park MMO?
---
* What quality were the alternatives at the time? 
---
* What was the gaming landscape like? Pre-MOBA? Pre-Battle Royale? Pre-Twitch?
---
The fact remains: You can't just slap new, power-creep riddled content on top of a Theme Park MMO like a sandwich. With enough content stacking on top of each other you dilute the population and create a steeper barrier to entry.
---
&gt; Oh boy, all those brilliant sandbox MMOs of the 2000s really laughed all the way to the bank.
---
**Sandbox MMOs might not be as popular as Theme Park MMOs, sure, but that doesn't mean you can't explore how they deal with those same issues.**
---
Its because as a non human rogue you will still have weapon skill from gear.  As weapon skill increases the effect of each point lowers.  If you compare a 305 human vs a 300 non human its a big deal but later not so much.  It also is useless in pvp.  The reason why its more damage on warrior is because higher damage on glancing is more rage per hit which = more dps.  Since its only for rogue white hits and energy gain is static it doesn't matter too much.  There are a lot of topics discussing this further.
---
If there was new content added to Classic eventually, set bonuses could enough of an incentive to complete new dungeon/raid content. Players would have the option to look different through new tier sets.
---
If there were new dungeons and  T1, T2, T3 raids that dropped gear with new set bonuses, would that allow for enough customization? Some of the Molten Core sets offer pretty good set bonuses, and I wonder if set bonuses could be a way to offset the stat increases that T3 gear offers for example. If there was new Tier 2 raid similar to Blackwing Lair, it could drop new set bonuses that changed the way certain talents worked. (ex. T2 mage set Spellweave Regalia  (5) Set Bonus Tier %chance Pyroblast hits multiple targets.  2 rogue set with a 5 piece set bonus that gives bonus % to a talent. Like 20% increased Master of Deception talent so you have better stealth. Gear set bonuses could we a way for players to enhance their talents and create new talent specs. Imagine if ret paladins could boost the effectiveness of the Retribution tree through raid gear set bonuses. If you change the talent trees, you risk homogenizing the classes. The issues with the vertical raid progression is that if attribute increases are all that matter, then higher tier drop gear is clearly better.
---
There was a Hero's Call Board in Cataclysm. There could be something similar in Classic where players could create and signup for serverwide events. Player-run PvP/PvE events such as speed runs, ironman runs, dueling tournaments, Roleplaying games etc..
---
Only because I think that wl is harder to master. I know that I struggle with complex pvp classes ;)

So, the truth is somewhere in the middle... I used to twink a 49 shaman and I ended up making a similar video at one point. It's true that procs are unreliable, but you can usually get a big windfury off at least once on every target that you 1v1.  
---
That said, all enhancement shaman were getting carried back then, and were definitely worse for a pvp group than more reliable class/builds. Unbreakable almost certainly hit rank 13 as healing/elemental and switched to enhancement after for the memes.

Used a loot council for like 7 years from Vanilla through Cata.  Works just fine if everyone in the guild has the same mindset and goals.  Everyone gets their gear eventually, and its better for the raid as a group.
---
7 years, with a lot of roster changes and even the core ~8 people fluctuated over that time, and it was never a problem, from vets who have been there since day 1 to new recruits who just joined the day before reset.
---
The flipside of this is that when tanks dislike each other, shit sucks, yo.
---
I was in a guild where we, the dps warriors and the main tank were tight, and we adopted the second offtank as a sort of honorary warrior (he was a bear tank and a total bro), but the first offtank was a total asshat. The raids where he didn't turn up where a thousand times smoother than when he did.
---
Finding a raid spot as a paladin will be easier. Only real difference between the two for raiding.
---
My god priests fort buff is stupid expensive! No seriously why is it so expensive to cast?
---
ah the good ol OOMkin, enjoy your time dirnking you disgusting birdbeast thing
---
Professional undead. At least after I re emerge from playing classic non stop
---
Cool anecdotal evidence bro. Because your singular experience is how it'll go for everyone. /s
---
It is I believe, but it’s a rare drop from raiding
---
Except in this scenario you are running with a team and you can collectively choose how prepared you want to be. Different teams will be more or less hardcore so you just have to pick the team that fits you.
---
The nice thing is you have time. It will take a long time to get get to max level but once you do a new patch/expansion isn’t going to come out and ruin the progression.
---
It's also worth noting that Unbreakable almost certainly hit rank 13 as healing/elemental and switched to enhancement after for the memes.  
---
Definitely be ready to heal 95% of the time
---
I'm not directly experienced here so take this with salt, but having spammed destro lock on a PVP pserv lately, I'd kill for paladin support. I can't think of a hole in my toolkit besides mobility that a paladin can't cover, and vice versa. If I get heals, blessings, and the occasional bop or hoj for support, I can't think of a duo I couldn't kill. It would be such an insane wrecking ball.
---
That said, your friend should play whatever is more appealing to him. It will be a lot more satisfying in the long run.
---
Mx150 is equivalent to a 1030 and it’s running its boost. Plus the game is a cpu hog and an i5 8250u is 4/8 so has lots of capability especially with its boost (max 3.4).
---
My desktop at home uses an old i5 4690k (oc to 4.5ghz) paired with a rx580 8gb. I can max Bfa and lock over 100fps even in raids.
---
Wow is really well optimised and low spec despite its poor MC support. Eg I get better Frames on Dx11 than 12.
---
Facts. Finishing a run quickly and cleanly without stutters or wipes, feels great.
---
Wow impressive. Did you use Need/Greed for all your cutting edge myth kills? That's a world first by itself.
---
Could be a different server where characters copy over.
---
Yah thats for sure, but the best thing from new raids will always be for tryhards. And its right, main thing is if basicly everyone using buffs, why u cant just rid of it, decrease toxicity level and buff content meanwhile
---
Honestly it's not that bad. Though I do tend to get Booming Voice or whatever the first tier talent is called, so yeah.
---
The sad thing is I can't even tell which ones are trolling and which ones are serious now
---
&gt; free mount.
---
https://i.redd.it/dh8yf54s71s21.jpg
---
Mages are popular in 5 mans for their utility, not your dps.
---
Def &amp; mel are pserver vets, they clearly have no problem with grinding and dont need a welcome to wow. They dont like it cause it garbage gameplay. You cant grind when your logd off waiting for raid the next day.
---
According to a website I’ve seen on this sub that estimates how long it will take you to get to 60. I selected shaman, 22 hours a week /played, quick leveling experience, and I’ll be starting at classic launch: says I’ll ding 60 Dec 3rd...
---
How dumb. They should just copy builds from the internet without fully understanding what some talents do.
---
There are a lot more factors to consider than just meters when it comes to a loot council. Are the mages decursing? How many of them died because they stood in something they shouldn't have? That 7th mage might not be topping the mage meters, but he could be doing more for the raid than the other 6 combined.
---
It's not even bottom 4.
---
I think if it stays like that for classic and shamans get to keep their skill I don't think people are going to riot over that.
---
Poor enhancement shamans suffer enough as it is and it doesn't seem to be a gamebreaking change if it is a change at all. 
---
I really wish they gave at least a few people access to the original 1.12, we could clearly see if this is intended or not.
---
Isn’t classic based if the Legion graphics engine? Shouldn’t be that much worse than retail I would think.
---
You laugh, but man, I see cryptojacking 24
---
/7 on my clients' environments.
---
I'm guess by the time naxx is out and a lot people are clearing it regularly it will be about 2 years down the line
---
I think it's a combination of both honestly. Both their single target and AoE dps is very nice. Also AoE kiting comes in very useful when a few too many mobs are pulled.
---
There are guilds that only raid weekends, so you should be fine tbh
---
Honestly, this seems like crap.  If you can't look at the build and understand it, then you need to do more research.
---
Yes if you’re a min maxer. Otherwise, not worth the time and effort in leveling it just for that set IMO.
---
Well that is just a sign of trust issues you might have. But sure i will send you receipt tomorrow straight away when i do the transaction to "pelastakaa lapset Ry". I am already a monthly donator but thats allright.
---
Melee chat was the best chat in my TBC guild.
---
I always play horde to be with friends but this time i'm playing what I want and going dwarf rogue.
---
I'm doing my part!
---
Yeah and you'll be spending your time grinding gold when getting your mount to make up for all the money you spent on drinks. In the end the result is the same.
---
I don't think that was unheard of in vanilla for a first main to possibly take that long. But this time around, so many people will have done this before and there are so many guides now that there will be so many max level players in two months.
---
There will be a ton of people racing to get classic firsts this time around.
---
Should have shield blocked
---
No because they both are the same sub.
---
Right, I understand you have had a bad experience with this as it was for whatever reason unsuccessful but it is still the most sustainable way in which to add progressively harder encounters and better gear for raiders without them one shotting other players or mobs out in the world or in BGs.
---
The purpose is not to make gear useless, it would just mean that the gear is the BiS PvE gear available for PvP and the world with the same stats as Naxx gear regardless of whether it's tier4 or tier20 as a tier20 geared character could take out 10 people without going below half hp.
---
Chain heal is already so good any buffs and it would be broken op
---
For classic definitely mage, shaman, warrior and rogue. Dont like the playstyle of any of em and apart from bloodfang I dont care for any of their gear.
---
I didn’t really start enjoying it until they added reinforcement points. Actually had a clock and the objectives had value
---
Boring as shit to play though (imo). I levelled 1-60 mage and hated it (I was a dumb kid and kept thinking it would get better plus I wanted to keep playing with friends). Rerolled a Druid at 60 and had a blast.
---
Nah, I bought them with WoW tokens, obviously.
---
ORC always wins in pvp.
---
Sure you might be better maxing out on +sp so you can nuke that mob. This works of course if you have 0 interest in any aoe farming and playing on a PVE server.
---
This entire argument/discussion is so weirdly twisted into where the only important part is being able to nuke that one mob. Int/stam makes it much easier to aoe farm, PvPing 1vX is impossible with no extra hp/mana.
---
RemindMe! 2 days
---
Exactly this \^\^.. I got stuck in the ''xD'' timeperk and im 26, not even 30. People still think im 12 when i do this.
---
Some gear will be, some won't. Things from MC like Choker of the Firelord is BIS until AQ40 and Briarwood Reed from UBRS will be used until Naxx. 
---
Even if you aren't min/maxing, you will need some gear from older raids to get invited to a group for a later raid.
---
Active players yes, but they both use the same subscription so not sure how one would surpass the other.
---
Wrap it up, guys, we're done!
---
&gt;HOWEVER, I'm not sure if "let's melee this" should ever be a go-to
---
definiely not vs rogue/warrior
---
orc
---
also dont go surv in early classic unless you absolutely have to for whatever reason
---
If anyone needs a casual family style guild for alliance side EST time zone send me a message
---
yeah it would be after 35 ish that i would do it
---
it's almost like people wanna play the game how they wanna play instead of what others want them to do.... the nerve
---
Classic wowhead earliest comments are saying Aboms in strat UD. So not just raiding. Just a super rare drop.
---
AV has always been boring imo, on every private server i’ve played i just grinded exalted on release in like 1-2 days then never touched it again.
---
Golden rule of pvp if you can play orc play it.
---
There's also a metal hand near the lava in LBRS.
---
I suspect half as many as retail till phase 2
---
with "early classic" im talking about pre-AQ
---
Nothing more filthy than  a 29 twink Hunter.  Crit raptor strike with the Corpsemaker was awesome.
---
AV is basically cast 5 heals and drink, 5 heals and drink for Resto Druid imo.  I really liked AV in the past but this is not fun imo.
---
druid and hunter
---
Yeahhhh true. The Tauren health thing is interesting though. If you max out the health boost, thats a 15% boost. Basically givingy ou the ability to get a crit.
---

---
Seal of Light:  chance to heal you when you attack, generally not good to use as a seal unless you are in dire straights.  Sometimes used for prot paladin for self sustain and combos well with reckoning.  Real purpose of seal of light is to judge it onto the enemy, making it so everyone else has a chance to heal themselves on attack.  The number is small but in a raid it is a ton of healing.  
---
Seal of Wisdom:  Similar to seal of light but for mana, if you are not worried about doing damage using seal of wisdom and auto attacking is a way of in combat regening for a holy paladin.  Like seal of light it can be judged as a debuff onto the target to give everyone else a chance to proc a mana return.  
---
Seal of Righteousness:  The default damage seal.  It scales with spell power only.  It cannot crit and melee stats do not effect it, so is best for holy paladin and generally best for prot paladin.  It judges for a damage hit, that can crit and only scales with spell power.  One nice thing about seal of righteousness is that the seal counts as a 2nd hit, so every swing you get melee and sor hits to trigger procs.  This causes anything with chance on hit to have a very high procrate.  Judging wisdom and auto attacking with a fast 1h with sor is very quick mana return.  
---
Seal of Command:  The ret seal.  It does damage based on your weapon damage, gets a boost from spell power, and can crit with melee crit.  The proc rate is based on a proc per minute, instead of a proc % per swing, meaning you get the same number of procs in a minute no matter how fast your weapon is, but since the proc is a swing of your weapon you want the slowest possible weapon so that those 7 procs hit the hardest possible.  Old memory, but if I recall the rule of thumb was that each 0.1 swing speed decrease was a 4% loss in seal of command damage.  So you really want something &gt;3.4, and around 2.7 or less seal of command no longer does enough damage to really be worth using over the other seals.  Judging seal of command does damage like seal of righteousness, is scales off of spell power, melee crit(so it crits for x2 instead of 1.5) and importantly does double damage on stunned or incapacitated targets.  
---
Seal of the Crusader:  If you find yourself with mostly melee gear, and a super fast 2h such that you cannot use seal of command, then this is the very narrow window where seal of the crusader is worth using.  Also a tech option with very certain gear, such as bone reavers edge and the armor penetrating trinket.  99% of the time seal of the crusader is going to be used to judge a target.  The judgement increases holy damage taken.  Use it if you are going to be fighting something for a long time and you want to maximize your damage.  Useful for all paladin specs, but often in such long fights judging wisdom or light is better, especially so if you are in a group that can benefit from those judgments.    
---
Seal of Justice:  Very rarely used.  The seal has a chance on hit to stun the target, so can be useful as an RNG interrupt but not very reliable.  Mostly used in pvp by holy to harass when they don't have anything better to do.  Judging it prevents the target of fleeing or being feared, no pvp use for this, but in pve you can use it to prevent humanoids who run when they low from running into adds and pulling more mobs onto you.  Useful when leveling in tight enemy camps, or in 5man dungeons such as SM if your group isn't very good at slowing the runners.
---
Also shamans dominated the 49 bracket....very diffferent to level 60
---
Anyone knows if Desperate Prayer can be used in ShadowForm?
---
Also does StoneSkin remove hunter stings?
---
why would you want to go surv in the first place?
---
it only becomes comparable with the other specs with tons of gear
---
I'm not talking about whether or not it does more damage. It's like saying "multiple more thans." It doesn't make sense
---
The 58 AV beta is certainly worth it.
---
It's basically an arena of full level cap chars that you can play instantly and gear imbalance isn't a problem yet.
---
Possibly the best vanilla AV experience you can ask for
---
Damn dude! Sounds like you’re really getting every drop of performance out of your systems! 
---
I have contemplated OC’ing my CPU and RAM, but I’m nervous about it.
---
I'm sure there's people on $200k + salaries, 10 years professional experience and tons of spreadsheets/graphs sitting on computers trying to work out an answer to that question right now.   
---
There's really no way of knowing what either week 1 logins will be or what the retention rate will be. I'm sure they're closely following twitch and reddit metrics to try to get a feel. They will probably have an open beta for the third stress test, and together with the reserve your character name 2 weeks out they will have a good starting point at numbers, but after that yeah you just have to guess.
---
New it was skarm before clicking
---
As someone planning on rolling shaman, keeping my wep skill on respec would be awesome!
---
I think the big thing you're missing in your analyse is the existence of STREAMERS, the vast majority of people that are a big enough asshole to camp low lvls are gonna be stream sniping. Personally i think the real issue is gonna be a lvl 60 running a mining route and killing you once every time they see you then continue their route. 
---
The one thing i've told my friend who has never played an MMO but wants to do classic as his introduction is that "sometimes you're not allowed to play your character"  
---
Depending on how layering is implemented it might be as simple as asking a friend to invite you to their group or relogging (have seen a clip of a person relogging at a mining node and its back) so you phase over and dodge the camper.
---
Even 50/50 is being generous, because no one seems to want it due to it being a genuinely good mechanic, only for authenticity.
---
Almost definitely not 100.
---
I'm thinking about 30
---
It is this very reason the Empire is the most popular faction in Warhammer Total War.
---
I mean, sure, but that's not a solution either. 
---
For an MMO to “work” you can't just split the same community into two. Like the devs (smartly) have said: We're not going to have *two* MMOs running side-by-side.
---
Leaving Classic servers intact while you develop a sequel server will *kill* Classic servers. They'll be ghost-towns because everyone wants to be where everyone else is—and everyone is going to be leveling on the latest content. This is true of Classic, too, since it's been fifteen years—it's acting like it was “newest content” for many players / streamers.
---
Ultimately, keeping old servers is such a “plausible deniability” move. It doesn't solve the issue. It just acts as a pacifier for babies—a way for the company to say: “See? You can still play the old version (solo) if you *really* want to!”
---
Pvp. It is my experience that survival can handle melee, and hunters do well against casters generally.
---
The only game I play is wow classic either beta or pserver :) so I have no need to upgrade which is a nice feeling however I am expecting I will build a gen3 ryzen come 7/7/19. 
---
Oc’ing i5 and i7 (unlocksd) CPU’s is quite easy if you have a good motherboard with software. Same with ram however I don’t OC my ram since it’s only single channel 8gb stick.
---
Are you kidding me? I was friends with 2 and loathed three others who were just there to steal my gear.
---
hunters counter melee and get screwed by mages
---
i'd say go for druid. it's a really fun and versatile class with great healing and solid tanking.
---
tanking: as a paladin you wont tank much in raids, in longer fights you have mana issues, and guilds are taking warriors instead of pally tanks. As a druid you might have a chanse to OT some bosses, but same  as the pallys, most of the guild rather take warriors (with hybrid builds, half prot half fury/arms) than druids/pallys.
---
healing: both class can put decent healing, maybe the paladins a little more, but both classes has pros/cons either. Paladins has to buff everyone in the raid with single buffs, yes even the "big" buffs are only 15 minutes longs and you have to buff everyone one by one. My friend was playing ally and he started every raid with 800 candles (reagent for the pally buff), but you are one of the best tank healer in vanilla, you can ress and remove magic/poison/disease as i remember. As a druid you wont have normal ress ("only" combat ress), you can remove only curses and poisons, your buff is a party buff. The druids also has hots, but in classic its a little bit tricky, not like in the later expensions, where 2 resto hots up the main tank and its a GG, in classic every friendly target can have only 1 pieces of 1 type of hot, which means if you put a reju on the main tank, and if the other druid will put his reju on it too, then he will override yours, ooor cannot use it as a more powerfull spell is on the target. This makes the druid healing a little bit hell, i mean the paladins/priests (shamans on the other side) wont care about your hots in raid healing, and the main tank can be healed with hots by only 1 druid. Regrowth cost way too much mana, so your only option is the healing touch, you need to lower rank it as only the rank 2 or rank 3 are fast enough to make decent healing, but for that you must took as much bonus healing you can (in pre raid bis gear you druid will look like a fcked up priest in purple/pink cloth items :D). So healing i would say, go pally, ofc guilds needs druids too for buff/CR/innervate and as i said it is a decent healer.
---
on the last part, leveling :) here the druid will beat the paladin easily, so if you go very casual, you might wanna go druid. To pull a paladin to max level as a casual coudl take a lot of time :(
---
This is the best and most wholesome thread I've seen here in weeks. Good luck in classic OP
---
totems, Totems, TOTEMS!
---
There's no way in hell NA alone ends up with 60 servers. That's just ludicrous. The entire point of layering is to support a lower number of servers so you don't have to later get rid of a bunch.
---
I should point out that my laptop isn’t ocd. That’s just stock boost. Laptops can’t really be ocd as their cpu is not unlocked and if it is you’ll cook it anyway.
---
Always? The stun resist is god tier but you can use other mechanics of the game than stuns. I’m talking fear, sleep, and other charm effects. You play against the right person - any orc character can get whooped.
---
No one is bringing some self-serving feral dps, regardless of world buffs.
---
but fast pet attack, grenades for dead zone, and tauren stomp can nullify a mage dead zone advantage right

That's 33 realms that (based on what we saw in Stress Tests), can service a minimum of 660,000 players (2 layers per continent) and at least 1,980,000 players (6 layers per continent).
---
Everyone is so helpful! I’m tempted to activate and try a private server of classic to just get a feel for it again but I have no clue how. Maybe a project for later today :) thanks boss!
---
This is a game where you kills thousands of mobs farming soul shards is not an issue.
---
On the bright side, theyre hard to kill. They're the tortise of the leveling race.
---
There are some extra Wrath ones to fill your gear out there, I have a +17 frost damage green helm on etc.
---
The proverbial pigeon knocking over the chess pieces thinking he has won. lol
---
Hm on the top of my head I know about an alchemy recipe that dropped in the barrens iirc. Elixir of .... growth or something similar. Long time ago that was worth a few silver on horde side but a rarity on alliance side. Idk why though since you could just go there as alliance aswell to farm but apparently few people did that. 
---
On the other side the white cat from that little boy wandering around sw. This one was quite expensive for horde back in the day
---
Yeah, I mean...I'm totally fine with getting destroyed now and then by a higher leveled character. That's not a big deal and it's definitely integral to the PvP server experience. I hadn't considered layering, though... That might be a good and easy way to cheese things in the beginning if you have to.
---
Lol at your advice to your friend, though. I guess that's what alts are for, right? :P
---
They no longer make it available to the general public. Investors still get the numbers.
---
I bind my strafe to the 2 mouse side-buttons, so I can move exclusively with my mouse and use A &amp; D for spell keybinds. Something to consider.
---
That's a good point. Can always sell off the excess when you get it. :D
---
I've never leveled a rogue, nor will I ever do so. I've had all classes but the rogue at max level every expansion since MoP. 
---
The whole class seems to be stun - vanish repeat and I actually hate it.
---

---
DKP is garbage and so is a system that requires massive spreadsheets to be maintained and for everyone involved to participate in its creation.  I literally just track attendance and raid logs, no input from anyone else required.
---
Just track attendance and watch DPS/Healing/Tanking details and its pretty apparent who you should be giving loot priority to.  Barring being the literal top guild who has the sway to kick anyone they want and snipe top players from lesser guilds, you're going to give gear to your "lesser" players, because as you've mentioned, people will get disgruntled and leave if you ignore them too much.  That said, if someone ragequits after 1-2 raids of not getting loot because someone else of the same class got it first, I'm not too concerned because that isn't the attitude I'm looking for in the long term.
---
Main tanks, tank healers, and those who have shown they consistently perform top DPS are going to get upgrades first, easy as that.  Don't be stupid and keep feeding the top DPS more gear because "durr, he does the most DPS!" if hes in full T2 and everyone else is in T1, split it up, but if you have 4 warlocks with similar gear levels and 1 is doing 20% more DPS every fight, every raid, well clearly he'll make the most use out of any given upgrade.  I don't need to spend 3 hours fucking with spreadsheets before or after the raid, I don't even need 30 seconds after the fight to make that decision.
---
All I need is a competent class lead for every class, to take some of the burden off me in case I'm not seeing some particular detail about their class for a given upgrade, but for the most part I'm just here to make a unilateral decision in a quick manner, and keep the group moving forward in both that particular raid, and in the content cycle in general.  And in my case, theres no favoritism because you all suck equally or you all excel equally, I don't favor one class over another, I don't care about one player over another.
---
7 years of relatively drama free loot council with plenty of roster fluctuation due to leaving the game, real life stuff, etc.  Not like we always had the same ~40 people for the entire time.  Never was the best guild on any server I was on, either.  Just always found people with the same mindset and goals.  I don't think it'll be a problem in Classic.
---
It makes sense for it to work that way and if it's in the beta I doubt they would deliberately change the weapon skill to reset.
---
I definitely don't agree with a lot of the values you gave or the selection of categories but if you're happy with your decision then power to you.
---
Do you think Classic WoW could be improved upon/enhanced in ways that better balanced classes and improved gameplay without screwing up what made Classic fun.
---
That's not really the point.
---
you can't get glansing blows in pvp?
---
Cheers, didnt know he made videos again. Saw his stuff from Feenix and downloaded that back then.
---
Holy shit this sounds fantastic. Knowing who gets what when you walk into the fucking raid, and no dkp gaming. Sign me up.
---
Try to hold on to int gear you pick up from quests and such along the way and you'll be absolutely fine. Just try to focus on int rewards from level 57 or something.
---
Sounds to me like you've been in all the wrong guilds.
---
Layering id gone after phase 2
---
As opposed to your weird shit that in 15 years of playing the game I've only ever heard of one other time before now.
---
Keep fighting the good fight, I guess?
---
you can get all of that without going surv
---
warstomp might help vs mage but they can deadzone you while avoiding warstomp afaik
---
Fewer the better

---
Erm, this video is from Oct. 29, 2006 which is 1.12 patch.
---
Yes, layering is gone after it's no longer needed.
---
And?
---
my friends are very much against rolling 2x of the same class but I kinda wish we would go 2 shammys, 8 totems are great help and shammy can fill basically any role if geared accordingly. very flexible
---
Yeah that shit is awful. I turned off style
---
Why do you want to roll it then?
---
What he said about guild makeup is exactly how every guild was up to TBC that I was in. Everything he said is on point.
---
As a hunter in PVP you never want to be in melee range, your best and more consistent damage is always ranged.
---
However sometimes you have no choice and the surv tree offer you some tools for those moments, but it's just for a hit and run kind of thing.
---
Your priority is always to put distance between you and your target, you won't out-melee melee specialists like rogues and warriors.
---
Taurens larger hitbox seems to be a big problem for a class that wants to get away from melee as fast as possible.
---
The spreadsheets are all automatic. You fill yours in on Google Sheets after being accepted. Doesn't take more than an hour.
---
what is discord?
---
yes, encourage more randoms to help me quest hehehe
---
Totally makes sense, just don’t remember vanilla being that way, and you know, no changes and all that.
---
Was totally prepared to deal with it, but would be happy not to.
---
AV question, can you still turn in ears etc. for faction rep or was that removed in 1.12?
---
im not reading all that just heal the tank and quit being a baby
---
It WAS dude, it was
---
I honestly want the most casual leveling experience with the possibility of pvping and raiding  later on, I was really thinking about a Hunter. How do they fair in both pvping and raiding at 60?
---
You have got to be trolling lol. You’re so immature in this thread, it’s unbelievable
---
And it was beautiful. 4 hours and people can do only thing that loosers have left: downvote. It is a sign of a pure, flawless victory. Veni, Vidi, Vici.
---
bUt GrEaTeR bLeSsInGs CoSt ReAgEnTs
---
It can not be used in shadow form, at least in vanilla it couldn't.
---
yup, but the talent tree was super super cookie cutter, there was almost 0 variation, only between PVP and PVE
---
&gt; EU-English will get 1 PVP, 1 PVE, &amp; 1 RP
---
Not sure if it's a good idea to pigeonhole most of the Europe + Russia to 3 servers, while America gets 10.
---
But I like you detailed analysis. Time will tell.
---
What if people don't leave in droves by the time phase 2 starts?
---
underrated
---
I was going to say deathcharger was lower drop, but according to old comment they raised it. Also, zulian tiger the second edition NE mount model, making it less unique than the winterspring, not to include the 200+ hours of mindless farming. That's why I said arguably.
---
it was changed in 1.11.
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_1.11.0
---
&gt;Two-Handed Axes/Maces (Enhancement Talent) - Skill levels gained with these two weapons will now be retained if you decide to unspend this talent point and return to it later.
---
Not able to watch the video at work, but skinning and vendoring the skins is the best way to make money on a fresh server IMO since no one has money to buy stuff on the AH. 
---
Skinning/tailoring with an alt that is herbalism/enchanting is the way to go. Send all crafted tailoring junk to level enchanting.
---
You are very upset over my opinion. I feel classic will have at least half as many players as retail through naxx
---
levelling as MM... ouch
---
I am guessing around 30-40
---
Ah, you're probably right, let's give them 2 more.
---
What's more consistent for pve? Ele or enhance?
---
 What a crock of shit... Everyone will be forced to stack them.  Even the most softcore guilds will do it.   One of the biggest reasons it will be so prevalent is because most guilds will use loot council.   You want loot, then your performance matters.  You cannot compete with someone with world buffs.
---
&gt; Always first to die
---
Man, that quote takes me [way back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yXAEzp6W-U).
---
your name is disturbing and unnatural. atleast you hate Danes right?
---
Can druid forms get affected by size debuffs (world enlarger, elixir of growths) ?
---
Are those 30 min? I thought they were just groupwide instead of individual.
---
Wtf is this
---
Thank you, what a great answer! I'll keep all of this in mind!
---
quick how do I give more than 1 upvote
---
0.3-alpha is available and should work pretty well in the beta
---
You don't bring cats to raids because they don't scale and will die to aoe. Wolf is used to stand back by the hunter and buff the group with their attack power howl.
---
I will fight the alliance, as they try and farm mount
---
Perfect, thank you!
---
They used to disappear when you logged out.
---
They take up tons of inventory space and you might have to go out and farm them before a raid. I don't mind having soul shards it gives flavor and identity to locks but it can be very inconvinient.
---
Maybe I'm misunderstanding what this addon does. How does it automate anything? Because you can just click the next available button in the list instead of the talent tree?
---
It's essentially your own "when to take which talent" notes but pretty and in game, no?
---
Flasks were always used.  Stop lying.
---
You wouldn't know because it's highly doubtful blizz will release those numbers.
---
I'm not upset at all, I'm just incredibly confused by your reasoning. You're basically suggesting that not a single person that starts classic will ever leave and layering is completely unneeded.
---
Do people not realize there are timers on these turn ins?  Good luck coordinating these buffs in conjunction with starting your raid on anything but a dead server. 
---
This was not an issue in vanilla.  It is an issue on private servers due to no timers.
---
Video is from 1.12. Even in the video description he clarifies the date...
---
The more mana you have, the longer it takes you to regen it. Stacking spellpower and spirit is way better than stacking int, unless you're AoE farming.
---
That's why I say somewhat considered. Not exactly the most alluring. Also, I thought the drop was raised to 1%?
---
Completely agreed on this. If you get the buff just before the raid, then all power to you. Hiwever, it makes little sense if players have to log out and and literally stop playing the game just so their dps is on par with others come raid time.
---
3-6 months
---
It's not the best way to make money on a fresh server and I just showed why.
---
You can farm DM as Ele / Enh. Theres guides on it as well.
---
What if the earth stops rotating tomorrow? That's more likely.
---
People **will** leave. They know it. We know it.
---
bruh its like im watching a nine year old commenting lol
---
No they’ve never disappeared.
---
Its because you literally don't even need to change gear for lower content like non mythic+ 5 mans, and LFR/normal and probably even heroic raids.
---
Oh you're a Ret pally?  As long as you have a 1 hander and shield, they all have int/str depending on spec, so you can play any spec you want to get the fastest queue.  So yeah, you have tons of tanks and healers, but they're all DPS in disguise and don't really know how to tank or heal.
---
Yes that *temporary popularity* of being the most successful mmo on the planet for 15 years straight. I mean it worked extremely well for the first 5 years. That period of WoW will go down as one of the biggest success stories in the history of gaming, up there with Minecraft and Fortnight and GTA.      
---
    
---
Of course we can sit around here in hindsight and *say x was a bad idea*, or *BFA only sold 3.4 million copies at launch and had high dropout*, but criticising Blizzard's 2006 and 2007 design decisions looks kinda pathetic given the context. If they had a chance to do it over again with a time machine they would be incredibly stupid to change WoW to being a levelling focused sandbox instead of an end game themepark. Now if we acknowledge that context it's fine to go on and say modern WoW is a complete mess with 15 years of content shoved into the one game and level scaling/heirlooms/Lfg has turned bfa levelling into insipid mushy grind. They do need to do something going forward, and by all accounts they will.
---
Well this will certainly be quite a different atmosphere then. At 60 the 19 and 29 WSG games were almost always pugs. 
---
Looking forward to the competition.
---
AV is always boring. On private servers if the AV lasts longer than 30 minutes people start to leave the BG.
---
This made me ugly laugh.
---
Hunters are natural caster counters aren't they? I thought rogues own hunters. The idea here would be that survival can do "OK" against anyone
---
Yeah, looks like it's not on the play store anymore.  Raid healer does look like the same premise though.
---
The gnolls over by hogger use undead death sound effects.
---
How old are you? Some of us have jobs and lives or school to attend lol
---
Up to 600? You gotta pump those numbers up! Those are rookie numbers.
---
Seriously though, I get 1000 MB memory usage on this site when it loads or I scroll through a page
---
I can't find it anymore but there was a very short PvP video featuring A Wilhelm Scream - Mute Print
---
Haha let alliance players enjoy their false sense if security.
---
Got a random fellow help me get my whirlwind axe at lvl 30, it was such a big dmg boost! Really helped me out leveling
---
I'd absolutely pay 40-50 a month for a wow that is like Vanilla
---
I hope they get some extra data to analyze from the Character creation / name reserving. If i remember correctly it is 2 weeks before official launch (if servers aren't already decided on that point).
---
You literally just agreed with me. 
---
Theme Park MMOs have a fundamental weak spot with balancing the endgame treadmill vs leveling over multiple stacking expansions over a large period of time and the solution is to delete or redesign much of that balance—something both the devs and the community have been unwilling to do in the past fifteen years. 
---
I’m glad we agree!
---
I do. 
---
But I think it's a slippery slope so we have to leave everything the same.
---
Discord is a free app/service for chatting and voice communication. You can organize your server any way you want, with different permissions, chat channels, voice channels, etc. And it has an open API, so people have made some nifty bots for it, including for World of Warcraft. The chat is much more robust (searchable, pingable, allows media), so it almost always gets used over the in-game chat channels. You can use it from your phone.
---
It's up to the community to create and maintain their Discord server, but usually you have one for your guild (takes the place of guild chat and is used for grouping, especially raids) and one for your realm+faction. Inside the realm discord they'll be people grouping up for dungeons, PVP, LFR, etc. The only thing I doubt we'll see in realm discords is any sort of trade chat, but who knows.
---
I’m pretty sure I Doomed the hell out of that box.
---
RIP AND TEAR
---
I have experienced this aswel on vanilla private servers. Questing is just a bit harder and everyone experiences the struggle, making most players more sympathatic. Buffing each other, inviting to quest together, asking for direction with their quests. It’s epic, immersing and makes me relive the true vanilla vibe. It’s not nostalgia that makes the game better, it truely was and is just a completely different game than retail.
---
Imo, Paladin desperately needed Crusader Strike as their 31 point Ret talent. Every other melee dps spec has an instant melee attack, except for Ret paladin. It makes the class lack that essential feeling of satisfaction of hitting a button and seeing the instant feedback of you swinging your weapon and doing big numbers.
---
I think it was a huge mistake on Blizzard's part to remove Crusader Strike from Paladins.
---
Yes I agree they are definitely a cancer.
---
I've always been in support of #nochanges, but it's kind of funny how making a change like this would actually preserve the feeling of #nochanges. World buffs may have existed in vanilla, but they were not abused like they are on private servers.
---
Are we trying to replicate vanilla, or are we going to replicate private servers?
---
Warrior isn't that bad if you keep your weapons up to date and don't fight mobs higher level than you. 
---
It's just slow to get to 60, but you can play it in a way that it's not frustrating.
---
what a zoomer
---
As for viability it is a hard question to answer. If you want to do organised pvp every team needs a flag carrier and that is bye far best performed by a druid. Any other spots is hard to fill for a druid. When it comes to professions druids are probably the only ones that don't need engineering due to the fact that they can't use most engineering stuff shapeshifted. A good item you kinda need tho is the enchanting trinket but you can dropp enchanting ones you get it
---
Orc is 100% better
---
Too bad there's a gnome in front of it
---
Totems group only, and lust was group only until Wrath as well.  Made for some interesting DPS logs when we'd get triple lusted in the Hunter group on a given fight.
---
Assume you won't be able to.
---
 If you can, run with it.
---
Maybe I should clarify: I would have preferred Paladins to have *very* short term buffs, but even more powerful to compensate. Make blessings last 1 minute, but double effectiveness. 
---
This perhaps could have been a talent choice. Actually acknowledge that Prot is a support/utility tree and top it off with that talent at 31 points. (Then again, I don't mind that they made Prot a real thing in TBC.)
---
Fair points
---
10 bosses in MC.

2ish pieces of loot per boss
---
Each character has 18 slots. Let’s say each character only needs 10 items from the raid.
---
That’s 400 drops needed to get your entire raid geared. That’s if all the drops are flawlessly what everyone needs(which won’t happen cause certain loot only comes from certain bosses.) 
---
That means, on a good situation here, you’re gonna need about 20 weeks to get your raid fully equipped. 
---
These numbers are just roughly slapped together. Obviously there are other variables at play. I’m sure someone could break it down better, but that’s the reality of it. It’s going to take a while for everyone to get geared.
---
Ah good point. Can you make an addon for me that works exactly how many frostbolts it will take to kill a lvl 48 ogre for me and then auto downranks as necessary? I can send you the server rng seed so you can work out if i get any crits or resists.
---
People will leave, but what makes you so sure more people wont join than people will leave in the course of 3~ months?
---
I have no doubt classic wont reach the insane success of getting 7.5 million players in 2 years like vanilla did, but who is to say it couldn't start with 500k, but have a much slower climb to 700k over the course of 2 years?
---
I honestly fail to understand how anyone can deny this as a possibility.  It is not unlikely that the game has a state of thriving for a few content phases, which is likely to last close to a year at least.
---
You’re right. Clearly they planned everything knowing all possible outcomes.
---
Better question. How do youuuuuu know they intended it and it wasn’t an obvious oversight?
---
Welcome to the twilight zone of retarded skepticism
---
Literally the only thing most of them need is reduced mana cost...  Which should be very easy to do.
---
Take your time leveling and enjoy the journey.
---
I'd certainly play a soughtafter class like resto shaman. They are notoriously the last class they fill up and you can just go as 31/0/20 and nobody can tell a difference if you are just slacking or you are full resto.
---
So elemental spec + resto gear is viable if you are into PvP and want to keep your PvP elemental spec.
---
MC, Ony, ZG and AQ20 are totally doable.
---
BWL+ will eventually be pugged but it will take a long time.
---
thats fair about the hitbox. How often do hunters get killed at range? Let's assume I can deal with the deadzone via grenades, scatter shot (in lieu of wyvern) and war stomp. I feel like with good gear, a hutner should be able to use the pet and mana sting to take down casters, and the survival benefits to erode melee advantage
---
Its easy, just swap friends with op
---
Both Druid and Shaman will be forced to heal in raids. Especially if your in a guild that's raiding within the first month. I'm sure more casual guilds will let hybrid classes dps but i doubt many guild like that will be raiding in the first month.
---
Idk what others likes about classic, but for me classic and TBC was fun because it was hard and time consuming, if you reached something that ment something, every pieces of your gear had value, and others could not reach it with 30 minutes gameplay... So we can start to make dual talents, lfg/lfr systems, buff every classes/specs to be able to make huge aoe/single target heal/dmg, buff the tanking threats into the sky so even if you just fart next to a mob it will attack you for the rest of the fight.... but if you wanna play that game just go play bfa. I know its harsh but that's the point. There are ppl who likes BFA as they have 30m-1h to play in a day, which is nothing in classic, you are happy if you found full party and got to the entrance for a dungeon in this time in classic :D. But this little time in BFA is enough to make the daily events, or make a fast mythic/bg.
---
You cant really compare these games, as they are designed to different customers, and by "nerfing" classic to make easier for the players, you just deny the core customers what they wanted.
---
With the Tauren hitbox being what it is, I don't think anyone ever wants to be a Tauren hunter.
---
No self-respecting nelf huntard would ever have anything other than a nightsaber as a pet, tyvm!
---
Wouldn't say no to old trees with the key skill thing though. Made life a lot less boring for some specs that dont otherwise get going until much later on
---
Should only take you about 12 hours to get to 20 if you know the quests and your class.  I know, we're talking about trying a new class here, but picking up a new class from 1-20 in Vanilla isn't overwhelmingly hard, its not like anyone has a ton of buttons to push until pre 20.
---
by hitbox you mean people just attack you more?
---
this for me. having my power baked into wooden thingers that come out of the ground that can be easily killed isnt my thing
---
WOKwobwobwobwob
---
Mathias, I'm trying to sneak around but I'm dummy thicc and the clap of my asscheeks keeps alerting the orcs.
---
The good ol' days.  My all-time favorite "help" to this day is when my Undead Mage was questing in Alterac Mountains in Vanilla; a gnome mage and I worked together, communicating through /commands and had a blast clearing our quest chains together.  Don't remember the player's name anymore, but it's a story I tell 14 years later; we were on a PvP server too, which made it more surreal for me (and the Alliance mage I'm sure) at the time!
---
It's not so much "their choice" when their guild requires them to do it. Even in the guilds without that rule, there's always going to be pressure to get your world buffs, because if you don't, someone else will and you fall behind.
---
Classwide. If you buff a warrior, every other warrior in the raid gets the same buff.
---
Seriously now? Its the same blizzard, that released wotlk, cataclysm, pandas, wod, legion and currently bfa in a row. Releasing a shit product seems to be their niche. I know, they can release a great classic wow now, but they have to listen to community and to common sense
---
Thanks, I can’t browse this sub on my pc and was looking for an explanation to fix it
---
My build is still relatively new, so I’m set too! I have been dabbling on a pserver as well, which obviously is pretty easy to run on a modern system. I don’t play much else either, but I’m just starting to get into more pc gaming. I’ve been stuck on consoles since the 80’s. LoL 
---
Good luck on your new build though!
---
&gt; I honestly fail to understand how anyone can deny this as a possibility.
---
That isn't how this game works. At not point will Classic ever have as many players as they do in the first month.
---
Warlocks because of soul shards, Druids because they’re terrible in Vanilla.
---
As a enh shaman healing in lower level dungeons, what is the etiquette of rolling for gear?  Is it generally ok to roll need for agi/str items or would I be expected to roll only for int?
---
All you do as ret in vanilla is hammer of justice, then judgement of justice, recast seal of command and pray for seal of command procs.
---
If you run into a priest... all they need to do is mana burn you twice then dispell you seals... and gg.
---
That is a class I was considering, as I mained a shaman throughout TBC, WOLTK and Cata and enjoyed it, nice to know I wouldn't nessecarily have to respec all the time too. I'm also considering preist, mage and warlock at the mo.
---
when i was super young and raiding I would get excited when other priests wouldnt show up to the raids cuz then i woudl get more gear lol.  as I got older I wanted everyone there for more competition and then it felt better when you get gear &amp; beat them on damage (spriest)
---
From what I am aware of, it should have both graphics settings from after the changes to the classic settings.
---
I'm not talking about everyone being required to have optimal everything
---
What I said is that as a suboptimal spec, you need to make yourself valuable to your teammates in a way other than damage if you want a chance at getting the good stuff - that way even though it won't benefit the group as much for you to get the item, they still give it to you because you've put in your time. A lot of guilds would give Sulf to the offtank who crafted nightfall first, then work on from there. Legandaries are usually given to the person everyone feels deserves it the more - if you want one as a suboptimal spec, you just need to try that much harder to contribute. Show up to raids whenever they need you, help farm mats for the guild bank. If they need someone to take up alchemy, take up alchemy. If they need you to level enchanting, then level enchanting.
---
Why would you want him to not get caught up in what I'm saying? Are you saying he should have a "fuck my teammates I'm going to do what I want" mindset and he'll have the most fun? Because he definitely won't and that's a recipe for failure. I'm not saying "suboptimal specs are a waste of time and no one will invite you into their raid". There's plenty of raid slots to go around, but people aren't going to like you as a suboptimal spec if you ignore the groups needs because you want to increase your small damage a little bit more. I'm saying that to get the desireable and hard to get gear in a raid as a suboptimal spec, you need to get go that extra mile so the guild is willing to even give it to you. You don't want everyone in the guild going "wtf? why did he get it? he's always at the bottom of the meters and refuses to make sacrifices for the team." You want them going "I think he should get it. Even though he doesn't do the best DPS, he's always on time, he always helps guildies out, and he's contributed a whole lot to progression even through ways other than damage".
---
The strongest argument for not removing/changing them is that, unlike private servers, there will be timers between turn ins. 
---
It is impractical to abuse them, and you'd either have to raid on extreme off hours after obtaining to items, or be on a dead server, because no one is going to delay their raid start time by up to 2 hours just to try and wait for at least one buff... let alone trying to stack multiple that are on timers.
---
Then dont drop them repeatedly? Just because you have them doesnt mean you continually use them. Or perhaps, the group needs to change its play style a little to better utilize the shaman? What an idea!
---
&gt; You can be flexible with getting world buffs. You can get them at any time and then just stay logged out until the raid starts.
---
Please stop pushing this idiocy. Spinning not playing the game as a positive, smh.
---
Raided throughout all of vanilla on bloodscalp. Not one of the guilds would've claimed raiding was easy. Not one. DPS our top guild who was world 3rd getting to 4 horsemen, and they spent 4 nights a week in naxx and about 6 hours per-raid. Not including preping for raid. They whiped 1000's of times.
---
Anyone who says it's easy is either has no idea what they're talking about, or have completely forgotten. Think a lot of people are in for a rude awakening.
---
Private server raiding was massively different for classic. Be it the 14% party bosses have (5 on private servers) they also have faulty resistance, armor values. World buffs on classic have cool downs. Spawns like black lotus will be far more rare, not having dynamic spawns. 
---
Just the party thing means tanks generate far less threat per second. Meaning DPS have to do far less damage, making the fight longer. Stressing healers, giving more time for that one guy to mess something up and wipe the raid.
---
Quality meme
---
does anyone know where to get the best WoW merc? trying to deck out my battlestation a little more before launch.  I prefer quality &gt; quantity.  plush/posters/etc
---
Ok against everyone means everyone is going to be Ok against you too
---
I wish...
---
Wow Classic Remastered would be sick. All original mechanics and gameplay systems, but with completely updated art assets and models.
---
12 hours is a very very short time for lvl 20 and most people won’t be able to do it. Even Staysafe couldn’t do it on beta, playing a class he knows in and out.
---
That's really strange to me that they would default to left hand (not the first time I've heard this in the comment). The struggle is real.
---
No, I mean that Tauren have an effectively larger minimum shoot range, as witnessed [here](https://clips.twitch.tv/DeadTiredHareOhMyDog). So as a Tauren Hunter, getting out of the deadzone (where you can't melee and can't use ranged abilities) will be more difficult.
---
Discipline heals my man
---
Precisely.
---
pally tank - they have no choice but to wait for drinking lol
---
This argument is complete piss in my mind.  How many guilds do you think will actually be asinine to enforce such a rule?  The most hardcore of hardcore might, but how many of those will there be?  
---
This just wasn't an issue in vanilla.  It is an issue on private servers due to how easy and reliable it is to stack all of them at once, due to having no timer between turn ins.  Good luck stacking multiple when the timers are engaged.  
---
Blizzard knows this is a non issue, and is likely just waiting till people see for themselves why this wasn't a problem to begin with.  So few people seem to be acknowledging the impractical nature of stacking these suckers.
---
Orc hunters also get 5% more pet dmg.
---
I just let the fucker die.
---
Actual right answer here
---
I'd say roll what you will enjoy the most anyway.
---
I feel like we should just buff the raids already and prevent the inevitable shitshow that will be unbuffed raids getting steamrolled by everyone.
---
I’ve been looking for this addon for ages! I could never find it though. This was from Lerc’s PvP video 
---
[here](https://youtu.be/za7keLoqoVY) 
---
Anyone remember or know?
---
So if a full raid of level 60 players gank a group of 5 level 30 players, and one of the level 60s happens to do more DPS, they carried the raid?
---
This is what you are claiming, unironically. 
---
There are a lot of reasons why world buffs in raids is a really stupid idea, but the biggest one for me is that it will require logging off to preserve the buff for some of them. Someone is "more prepared" than me because they literally didn't play. That's so toxic, stupid, and bad design, and I haven't seen anywhere close to a good argument to defend it.
---
&gt; what made Classic fun  
---
The reality is that's 1000 different things to 1000 different people. Any change will upset people so the two options are basically change everything or change nothing. In the interests of releasing the game this decade, they chose *change nothing*.  
---
We will probably see the conversation about whether changes ok change a lot once the game is out. At the moment while people are daydreaming about playing people have incredibly strong ideas that aren't based on much.
---
Read the title. EPGP still fits. :)
---
So, there won't be any updated graphics?
---
[Here is](https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?class=shaman&amp;talents=BoBpBqBrBsycyCyDyEyFykyfyxyeywydypyqyrysxwxRxSxTxUxtxZx0x1x2xDxxxGxHyiJkJlyjyhJmJnJoJpJqBn) what i always use for leveling a shaman. You get SS a bit later but you have a bit easier time when the dungeons starting to hit harder
---
But you will be perfectly fine otherwise, just save every +int item you see, be it cloth or leather, until lvl 60 just ignore all other stats and focus int (or mp5)
---
I don't know why this is so hard to understand for you low attention span zoomers, but nothing requires you to stay in the BG until the end. You don't get punished for leaving the match before it ends. AV existed for being the most efficient way to grind honor for ranking up. The longer the matches are, the more efficient it is, because you don't have to queue again.
---
&gt;Killing the same player multiple times reduces the amount of honor you receive.
---
Pretty sure this did not apply inside battlegrounds, like 99% sure. However let's assume a hypothetical scenario where this insane rule would work inside a BG, even though it was created solely to discourage ganking in world PvP. You would still not suffer from this in AV, because the enemy team has 40 different players that are constantly changing as their players are leaving and new ones are joining the match.
---
Don't argue with people who actually played battlegrounds back in the day.
---
&gt;then why do pserver players
---
You can't ever apply anything priva server players do to real vanilla WoW. Priva players are severely autistic and do things such as Devilsaur mafias and Battleground mafias (both permabans on official servers), min-maxing characters through abusing priva server bugs (another bannable offense on real servers, intentional bug abuse) and many other things not applicable to official servers.
---
Friends are like healthstones, you make them when times are good, and consume them when times are bad.
---
There is. It’s on retail client.
---
Each week, when raids reset, we'd go through and discuss if we thought any changes should be made with how we allocate items. A number of factors contribute to it, a starting point was always to look at EPGP ratios as it was a good non-bias source to begin with. I tracked total EP without decay so I could compare how much each person has done with the guild in total. If there wasn't a good argument between a couple people, we'd just setup a rotating weekly priority. One week person X gets it reserved, next week person Y, repeat. Then /roll to see who started that week.  
---
Obviously overarching all of this is guild progression. If there is a critical piece of gear missing from a person, they're gonna get it to help the guild progress.
---
I'd probably say the main function of class leads was managing loot for their class. It's the biggest source of drama, EPGP is just there to deal with the loot no one cares about and serves as a non-biased data point for reference.
---
You are deluded as fuck.  You must need to handicap. What's it like to be really bad at the game you have played for 15 years?
---
Yet they aren't dropping layering in the first month when it would be most relevant to start opening more servers, they are keeping it for the entirety of phase 1.  
---
The rush will have long since passed after 3+ months (doubt they would move to phase 2 when most people haven't even hit 60 yet) and a steady growth to replenish these layers will surely have happened.  
---
So what is the solution if 2-3 layers are still full on most servers by the time phase 2 starts?
---
This is a very real possibility, and while neither of us can say with certainty it will be one way or the other... both can still happen.  So what is the fallback?
---
In both cases, they are a decent choise. In pve a decent ranged dmg, and not so paper as mages, but there is a huge difference between good hunters and the "OMG whatta fck Legolas" hunters, controlling pet/mana etc could take time to master. In pvp it is fun to shoot the clothies, but you always need to position yourself to avoid melees/slows. In both cases the hardest part to find a SPOT, raid spot or premade bg spots.
---
I’m not in the beta but from what I understand it’s the original graphics but the settings menu is able to better utilize new graphics cards? So higher res settings and AA?
---
Blizzard has a long-standing policy of one input, one action when it comes to multiple instances of their games running.
---
So if you've got two accounts your paying for, and you're not running any scripts, you're fine. The second you start automating things is when you get into trouble.
---
The "rough anal allianced" comment made me cringe to oblivion.
---
Only Classic graphic will be avilable. You'll be able to toggle more détails but no more than that.
---
Blizzard is insistent because it's the cheapest solution they have to manage the population, even if it's bad for the game overall. Layering is using the same tech as sharding in the modern game, so I doubt it took them much time to implement it.
---
Just curious, in the beta, is voice chat common in PUGs? I'm wondering if I can avoid it without getting kicked from groups.
---
Pet damage, stun resist and a macroed extra AP raptor strike when you basically got 0 extra melee ap in full tier one... there’s nothing that can even remotely compare to orc
---
you think they'll fix that?
---
Money Management! Don't learn all of your skills at once - just focus on your bread-and-butter abilities at first. And dont buy equipment at auction. Try to be frugal and you will be able to get your mount at 40 (unless you are a warlock or paladin, then disregard!)
---
i'd rather have a chance rather than rock paper scissors
---
Not until Naxx they were to expensive.
---
This, he may not even enough time to even fully commit to one raid if several hours means 3ish.
---
I keep seeing enhance mentioned. I was hoping to spec Ele and heal, will that be a bad idea?
---
"time to wipe boys"
---
Waaauw I thought orcs couldn’t die ....
---
You shouldn't avoid anything, you should choose whatever you think is interesting and fun.
---
There's a separate subreddit for that, classic plus.
---
But knowing blizzard, once the subscriptions stop dropping off all bets are off.
---
&gt; Yet they aren't dropping layering in the first month when it would be most relevant to start opening more servers, they are keeping it for the entirety of phase 1.
---
This has literally never been said. What they **actually** said was:
---
A) At maximum, it would be removed when phase 2 hits
---
B) it'll probably only be for the first month or so
---
WoW Classic has some engine improvements from Retail, but not all of them. This means your performance over the original client used in Private Servers will be improved. But WoW Classic is using all the old character models and textures.
---
Got it! Thanks for the heads up.
---
I am sorry but that was propably the worst comeback / try to insult i have ever seen. That is exactly one of the reasons that why i win &amp; you loose. God it feels awesome.
---
Noggen flogger is amazing when you're flag carrying, the shrink makes you incredibly hard to see.
---
Most people are always alliance players
---
People hate bad posture
---
Well they said they’ll base it off the playerbase’s rate of progression and the overall feel of the players. I think that kind of shows not even Blizzard themself knows.  
---
That being said, you can imagine it’ll be within the 2 year time frame, and beings that there are 6 phases that puts some around the 3 month mark with a few a bit longer like BWL, Gong event, and Naxxramas. Phase 2/4 should be the shortest imo but nobody knows for sure.
---
In early raids they are good but drop in dps compared to other classes due to their pet damage not being inproved by gear, this is not a big deal tho, not the best but by far not the worst in PvE. In PvP they are great, the cookie-cutter trueshot-surefooted build used for PvE is good in PvP so no need to respec as well. tho they have a big weakness in PvP due to the deadzone when they cant mele or use ranged abilities. if you want to play one you need to be good at controlling your pet and kiting.
---
Yea, on characters that you wont lose and can gain rewards on.
---
These guys got lvl 58 characters that are even more short lived than their normal beta ones, and even those are temporary.
---
Nope. They confirmed it's not a bug.
---
I still have muscle memory for dropping Grounding Totem.  The rest of my totems I'd be content to look at my action bar for, but when one needed to be dropped *now now now*, I was ready!
---
Some pieces yes, there are many that won't be replaced for a very long time.
---
That's the warrior talent, not the human racial.
---
IIRC all that +5 weapon skill will do is make you miss less. Could be wrong
---
Yep, the subreddit style almost breaks firefox, no other subreddits have this problem for me it's weird.
---
But it isnt that simple, when your rock beats 66% and you lose 33%. You are going to trade beating out many classes for an even playing field for two.
---
How hard is it to keep engineering current as you level? 
---
Keen to get iron grenades for pvp before I get death coil as lock, but don't want to sink time into it if it's going to slow the levelling process considerably
---
Doesn't matter what form of AV you are playing.  Bottom line is that without any reward structure and on a very temporary character that was given to you, it is going to just be mindless. 
---
AV has always been my favorite, but the only thing that kept it fresh for the long term was when I over gear people and can stomp the living crap out of them for fun.
---
Calm down buddy.
---
Thanks for the insight. I really want to raid, but my work schedule is all out of wack due to rotating shift so I don’t see me being on a set raiding schedule working :/
---
I don't think so, and you probably shouldn't be building your character around fighting players 6 levels higher than you regardless.
---
A lot of gear from ony/mc is BIS for some classes all the way to the end. That doesn't include legendaries
---
Indeed. And that is one of the reasons you didn't see any disc priests in vanilla. Disc talents were the "misc" talents for both shadow and holy
---
Wait what? Are you seriously implying that layering *won't* negatively affect the community? That's the biggest tradeoff of the whole system!
---
On one hand, it's easy and simple for Blizzard to implement, but it directly comes at the cost of having a consistent community. That part of the game won't exist in classic unless layering goes away.
---
After I get exalted on AV in Classic I’m never touching it again.
---
Ahaha no for pvp it’s beastmaster. 
---
Nothing can compete with the petstun and enrage.
---
Surviveability is a useless spec and should NEVER be done.
---
Even with the “more damage once you reach x agi” you lose300-400 ap for melees in raid and it’s less damage. 
---
Pvp - BM 
---
PvE - MM (20-31-0) unless you’re a lazy raider up until aq40 then you can use giant and dragon slaying
---
When healing levelling dungeons it is all about your manapool so don't keep any +healing if it doesn't have good int.
---
Someone is more prepared than you because they bothered to go and get the buff. You're able to do so yourself. Whether you stay offline, online, it doesn't really matter, all that matters is if you have the buff or not. Yes, they are more prepared than you in that case. So someone that has fully prepared, doing more damage in a raid, is carrying you, the person who did not prepare, and is doing less damage in the raid. Your personal issues with world buffs doesn't really factor in. Does that make sense?
---
Aside from a week-one Ragnaros kill, the only goal I've really set for myself is to obtain 214,748 gold 36 silver and 47 copper (without using IRL funds).
---
Warriors have the flurry talent aswell, right? If not, I guess an enh shaman with high crit and 5/5 flurry could be a decent nightfall wielder.
---
hahaha i love u my eastern european comrade
---
Are you sure? In the end, people will be running around in naxx gear, which is better than anything PvP can give as it simply brings so much firepower.
---
What race is better for pvp as a horde mage?
---
Can you elaborate on that.
---
And millions of players fighting to do the same quest also didn’t exist in classic. You’re getting the same vanilla release. You know how many players were there when wow launched? Haha
---
We used them.  I sold shitloads of them throughout vanilla.  What were they buying them for?  lol  You are talking out of your ass mate.
---
My goal is to resist the urge to play it.
---
You tend to have a couple of druids in dps/hybrid for the critbuff, mangle etc.
---
Certainly won't be a traditional dps spec though. Also tend to get gear rather late since others take it first in terms of priority
---
Yes, and assuming they are going with minimal server counts, the chance that layering stays until phase 2 is going to be higher no matter how you cut it. 
---
So again, assuming my scenario plays out (which like it or not, is possible), what is the plan if 2-3 layers are full by the end of the worst case scenario of phase 2 starting?
---
It's a fair pain. Probably just unlock iron nades - 90% of their use is the stun.
---
Once warlocks get tier 2 you can’t kill them and spriests with proper gear also dick you.
---
Yep. Drinking for 15s, in that time the group has moved forward and around a corner. Then the tank wonders why there are no heals.
---
Fortunately, I don't force anyone to raid with me, and everyone agrees with the system before their time is wasted doing something they disagree with.  If they change their mind later, thats on them.
---
I'll go back to what worked for my group for my entire raiding career, no need to force it on anyone who wants to do something else, though I'll still shit all over DKP every day of the week.
---
It is hard to level as elemental pre 40 but you go for it. Healing as elemental is almost easier then enhancement sins you don't need a separate set of gear
---
Honestly, even if everything you are writing is true, you are still making an argument to remove them. Vanilla will be much more interesting if the content actually does have "progression" in the PVE sense, although I believe a ton of people are about to be super disappointed with how few mechanics bosses have.
---
I wondered the same thing and tried it. It'll actually depress you.
---
I only recommend doing the death knight starting zone because that segment is so awesome and fills me with the feels. Then quit.
---
I recommend you recreate the 2004 waiting for WoW to release experience by playing Diablo 2 for the next two months. Ladder reset was two days ago, so it's like the game is fresh. It's what my friends and I are doing. Come join the fun!
---
I don't think the updated raid frames will be in the classic release.
---
Paladin?
---
for sure, but I would prefer vanilla style, where youre stuck auto attacking till you get deep down in the talent tree kinda, makes the end of the journey a whole lot sweeter
---
Well, first things first, hit 60, followed by farming for an epic mount and work on my professions. Then will come gearing up and preparing for raids. Would be nice to get the Zulian Tiger down the road though since I never got it in retail before they got rid of it.
---
As someone who played on his server and farmed him relentlessly in world PvP, don't copy anything he does. He's known on the server for being a bad player. He edited some footage to only show the 1 kill out of 100 fights that made him look good.
---
Is shockadin a viable pvp spec for fighting on my own? I'm unfamiliar with the build.
---
Fair enough, I don't have beta access and I don't watch streams, so I'm basing this all off fuzzy memory of Vanilla and years of private server experience, which I fully expect to not be identical to Classic.
---
6 months I believe. It was a huge show-stopper for some people, as raid spots obviously couldn't be guaranteed when people transferred, so you might have a naxx-ready raiding character (something that took massive amounts of work to get), who got kicked from the guild they  tried joining, having to go to worse guilds or waiting 6 months to find a new guild on another server.
---
Enjoy myself
---
How about we just remove layers, and you can just not play until the population gets low enough. That's much more reasonable, it would be a week at most of waiting.
---
August 26th in the UK is a day earlier (and more) than the 27th in the US
---
Week one rag. Then focus on world pvp once raiding is out of the way.
---
And still they only take 1 or two warlocks to Naxx40. Its bs, there is no demand this big for locks.
---
What is the ideal spec for fighting on my own? I understand big dick DPs doesn't happen, and that I am to outlast my opponent. Is this the correct way to fight as a paladin? As I am outlasting them, can I still damage them down?
---
Main tanks &gt; off tanks &gt; DPS warriors/hunters &gt; everyone else
---
Ive started 3 mages. One vanilla, one TBC, one current retail but I've never gotten past 20 or so. The class just feels so squishy to me and I never got the hang of it.
---
What build or approach would I take to do this?
---
I'm just going with a threat meter, castbar and bartender.
---
Things like dbm/bigwigs and WeakAuras won't be necessary in vanilla imo.
---
Oh, don't worry. Nobody gets mad if you don't talk. Everyone's used with not talking in PUGs.
---
Voice chat just makes things easier and makes the social interaction even better. You connect better with people in my opinion.
---
My Goals? Enjoy the Game i fell in love with once more.
---
Something i can not do in Retail WoW anymore.
---
And find a decent Guild and Hopefully do all the Content. :)
---
Yes, but investors don't view that information as being something the public should see.  If it potentially harms their earnings, then they speak out.
---
Booo
---
that was 15 years ago &lt;3
---
&gt;Think beyond the launch....
---
Tell yourself that. The whole point of layering is to make the launch smooth. Think beyond the launch. Layering is going to negatively impact the game for months.
---
The #NOCHANGES crowd really can REEEEE like the best of em. 
---
The argument to remove raid buffs is literally an argument to keep the vanilla experience as close to it actually was as possible. The entire point of #NOCHANGES is to keep the vanilla experience as close to it actually was as possible. Use your brain, stop arguing against your own cause. JFC
---
Mic drop
---
You don't get punished for leaving early, no. But people want to win to get that extra honor and the 3 AV marks for a turn in quest or just for the reputation and honor gain.
---
&gt; Pretty sure this did not apply inside battlegrounds, like 99% sure. 
---
Sorry I don't remember every single detail of every single patch that Blizzard implemented, when they implemented it, and all the ins and outs. Maybe that part I learned wrong, but the way I saw it written about and read about it myself, I assumed that was the point. And yes, there are 40 people, but if you end a BG with 1,000 honorable kills, those should all count, no? So a majority of the people who died are... killed multiple times and probably worth nothing (if that's how it went.)
---
&gt; Don't argue with people who actually played battlegrounds back in the day. 
---
I did play Battlegrounds back in the day. Granted I did not spend 14 hours a day playing WoW since I had school and other obligations I had to tend to before I decided to play, but yes I did partake in BGs. I know how they went. I remember the old 3 hour queue times for AV, the back and forth graveyard capping and all that fun stuff.
---
I have to say though, attacking pserver players like that is... odd. Considering a lot of people who play that are people who used to play Vanilla in the first place. Granted, I feel like they are a little... nuttier, I will agree on that part. But most of them play it because they played Vanilla, and they play it like everybody else wants to, which is avoiding the long AV battles to grind out honor and rank up and do other BGs. But if you go onto a pserver with a population of about 6k online, you won't see a single AV active unless it's AV weekend, that's how unpopular it really is as a BG.
---
I'm not going to sit here and keep trading insults at each other, you got your opinion, I got mine. You like the way the old BG was, as do many others who share the same sentiment as you. But a majority of the people did not like it. Me personally, I think it had the right idea there to make it a great BG, but they made a PvP battleground into a PvE based battleground. If they changed a few things to make it all about the PvP, tug of war, 2-3, hell even 4 hour long matches, where you can get rep by doing battles but also side objectives in the battleground to help your team's cause, it'd be an awesome BG.
---
But the fact is, that multi-day long battleground style is not something players want. They want it to experience it, but you can read the comments yourself and even people who were just playing in a beta for the weekend for AV alone were sick of it after a couple hours and one match. They weren't working towards anything obviously so that takes a major part in it, but what happens when they get exalted with AV and it's the same thing again? They won't want to play, they have no reason to.
---
Have a good one sir, see you at launch (maybe).
---
Just to have fun reliving the old days. Make new friends, maybe run a guild or two again. Also become a proficient healer cause that’s the only thing I’ve never done in WoW is main a healer
---
The notion that Blizzard should account for something everyone knows isn't actually going to happen is an interesting theory.
---
to play the video game
---
Not sure which addon used to do that, but i know that weakauras 2 can easily do that.         
---
How to do it is easily found with some googling.
---
There's a special exception at 60 where it makes 10.
---
Any transporter had a chance of that debuff I thought
---
Become that feral who makes everyone sigh when they see him in WSG
---
thats easy, UD :) remove fear &gt; little bit haste
---
Mage with frost nova might top that.
---
Yikes
---
So you're saying that layering doesn't even manage to solve the competition issue? Great! Then let's remove it.
---
Pog
---
Youre fine
---
Classic runs on a toaster
---
I mean I was in a guild that killed KT ( dread on korgath)
---
We only used flasks for patchwerk / Lotheb / 4 horseman / Saph and KT
---
Classic runs on IGPUs without any issue. Guy is fine
---
&gt;all that matters is if you have the buff or not.
---
I'm glad you were able to highlight part of the problem. Because it does matter whether you stay offline or online. Mechanics promoting you to log off to be optimal have no place. It's even harder for you to defend because they weren't used almost ever in vanilla, so removing them is actually keeping it more similar to vanilla, even though its a #CHANGE.
---
But that's the problem with Loot Council, you can never be sure how a guild utilizes it until you're in the raids. It could be totally benign or totally corrupt and you wouldn't know until you've wasted a ton of your time.
---
With Loot Lists, you know exactly how everything works before you even apply.
---
In the first few months tailoring is one of the few professions that is worth the effort and cost
---
Just a liar.
---
Man the biggest winners of Classic are going to be the ones that have old builds of Cheeky's Hunter Bible spreadsheet.  TBC-caliber DPS in vanilla \*happened\*.
---
If nothing else, look at their plan for layering.  They are actually hoping classic will lose many players before phase 2. 
---
If more players join than leave within 3~ months, then they can't actually remove layering, because they would then have a potential 10k+ players trying to log into a server with a 3.5k cap.  
---
Call it a tinfoil hat theory, but the whole plan seems rather sketchy to me.  They have no faith in their product like the old Blizzard team had back then with vanilla.  Assuming your product will fail simply does not instill confidence, and I am actually looking forward to the next shareholder meeting to see if any investors have something to say about that very notion.
---
I have simple ones, nothing too serious just...
---
Full teir 2 pally
---
And corrupted Ashbringer 
---
Ya know...easy things-
---
How about no layering, and you can just wait a week or two for the population to settle before playing. Then you can have *your* desired experience.
---
This should be obvious  after they have announced  the LvL Squish and WoW going back to it's roots for retail classic. Their clear goal is to convert classic players to retail players.
---
The only thing that could change that would be a huge demand for classic and classic+ content. If that were the case and Blizzard things there was money to be made with classic+ they might just go the Runescape Route and create dedicated classic content.
---
K sure and you think reduced mana costs won't make certain specs even stronger in pvp than they currently are?
---
So meme specs are for content you've already got on farm?   
---
I might give up my dreams to dps NAXX as a shadow priest wielding a fishing rod.
---
👌
---
Reach level 60, to start.
---
Learn to play my class(es).
---
Max professions.
---
Make some gold.
---
Put away 5 bucks a day until release and you’ll be able to afford a good pc for it by launch. Watch r/BuildAPCSales  like a hawk and wait for a great deal on pre built pcs if you dont wanna build one
---
Mangle isn’t a thing in Classic, that was TBC. I’d say any Druid that is feral will be expected to offtank as well
---
So much this. People get the warm fuzzies thinking about doing turtle AVs from when they were 15 and didn't know anything other than shooting each other from range for 12 hours trying to get killing blows with zero character advancement. Trying desperately to take an objective which would actually sabotage your team from winning because you don't know better. I mean, yeah, I did it too, and it was a blast for the first 20 times but I literally never want to do that again. It just isn't fun when you know you aren't gaining anything from it and you are a time limited adult now with actual character goals.
---
My guild only took Orcs. We didn't realise how limiting that was until Molten Core. Then the guild was merged with a less... Stupid guild.
---
it's not hard. Just not as fast as Enhancement (more sitting hurts quite a lot in terms of time efficency)
---
The only modern engine benefits Classic will see is the lighting and water updates. 
---
Models and textures will be from Vanilla.
---
As it should be.
---
It was a healer joke.
---
All the comments in this thread solely mentioning min/max leveling efficiencies for speed leveling... I’d argue while leveling (esp on a pvp server) having a ton of frost damage would have its own benefit. While leveling being able to burn down the other faction in pvp is also a big benefit. I’ve always leveled with a lot of +dmg over rote isn’t/Stam/spirit (I obv don’t ignore them but I also don’t go out of my way to stack them) and I’ve never had an issue and I do agree that a bit more of a focus on +dmg than people typically do is the way to go
---
That would be the most idyllic use, yes. But in practice it's gonna turn into googling "best warrior leveling build" and just blindly downloading the highest rated build and running it without taking the time to understand why or how each talent works with each other, or even consider any talents that aren't part of the vuild.
---
The "no changes" is about releasing the game as close to as it was as possible, its not about forcing people to play it in a certain way.
---
You wont be able to copy the exact experience, since its another time and a lot more information is available.
---
So the best thing to do is to release THE GAME as close to as it was, which would include world buffs.
---
You cant make people play exactly like they did in vanilla, and forcing people to do that through ingame changes is really dumb and not what people are arguing for with "no changes".
---
Youve just made up your own version of "no changes".
---
It's just a worse , more defensive shaman.

I rolled with this on a private server and it works pretty well on 1v1s.
---
It tells you where to put each skill pt as you level.
---
wasnt it relativly cheap on mana, making it a good opener ( + stronger do than fireball) ?
---
&gt; The "no changes" is about releasing the game as close to as it was as possible
---
Cool, glad you finally came around to agreeing that world buffs in raids is a massive change to how it was.
---
Are you serious? You type all this out and it’s worthless. Sulfuras isn’t that great of a weapon. Nobody gives a shit. It’s for fun. Giving it to an enhancement shaman is fun. And you know what makes the most sense here? Shamans can’t use 2h swords. All of those offtanks and other dps are going to want Ashkandi. Giving it to an enhancement shaman gives it the most longevity it could probably get.
---
Nice rebuttal! You sure showed him. Why are you so offended by his points?
---
oh, i've mixed something up in that case 
---
Thanks for correction
---
Lying about what ?  
---
Here's me raiding with them when our tank got 1 shot because the server was lagging so much.

Shaman also supports his group, but has a gameplay.
---
Why are you pretending like there's only one alternative to layering? Furthermore, why pick the worst alternative option? You know  you don't *have* to defend everything Blizzard does.
---
Get to 60 in a reasonable time frame due to work commitments
---
IIRC, that's an extremely rare drop. The other patterns mentioned are all common/vendor/trainer
---
Week one rag sounds so crazy thinking it took people weeks to get 60 back in the day let alone kill rag.
---
Roll a tank class and form your own guild. BOOM done. 
---
More than likely you’re core guild/raid members professions with cover everything you need. Help each other out.
---
Yeah, I don't think it will be 9.0, but instead of 10.0, they might just announce "World of Warcraft 2". A marriage between some of Retail's best things and some of the things they lost along the way that people from Classic want back with a complete and utter reset for both playerbases (except the names, I think they'll let people pre-emptively transfer their names).
---
You'll probly watch some videos if you haven't already, but just ignore/refrain from watching anything talking about the "best" of anything in terms of classes or races. For a class find out what would be the most fun and matches your playstyle for what you want to be doing. Understand that some guides that say a certain class is hard to level is NOT joking and you will die because you are new, even if you play the "best" leveling class. Don't let that scare you however, because that difficulty can be very rewarding. For races pick what looks coolest - once you've decided your class look up armor sets or how that race looks in the armor you will be wearing.
---
That's it. Follow a leveling guide if you like to follow guides like me. If not, just wing it. 
---
You got this.
---
Yes! I was really surprised to experience kind players and fun interactions all the time on private servers, and its definitely the game design that encourages it. Not nostalgia.
---
On a side note: I was even more surprised to find so many kind and social players on private servers when the forums of the private servers could be some toxic shit.
---
I swear the only thing I get from most people on this subreddit on this subject is the straw man treatment.  
---
You can't just assume that the best case scenario will happen (which btw, the best case is a negative net loss for the game in a very short period of time) in regards to layering being removed, when there is absolutely a chance that the game does not lose enough players on many server to warrant dropping layering. 
---
Here is food for thought.  There will always be some servers that are at capacity.  Every MMORPG I have ever played, even if crappy, always had a good 10% of the server list at max with ques, even if every other server was practically dead.  
---
If those max capacity servers don't lose enough players to reach the 3.5k server cap... then what?  Should they just have them all server transfer, or will there be gargantuan ques out of no where?  Layering is a very short term solution with long term consequences, as opposed to not having it having short term issues, but with a healthier long term.
---
I think the addition of a few side quests to bump up their stats would be acceptable. Not much would probably need to be done to give them some viability.
---
Hey thats not all they do, they also get to freeze stuff on top of healers.
---
1) You're going to be short on mana *and* healing so you're going to be drinking basically after every pull to ensure you don't oom and drop your tank. It's possible, but very risky without practice especially closer to level cap as your gear becomes more optimal for Enh and less for Resto. 
---
2) Like other's have said, simply save as many int, +spell damage and healing and +healing pieces as you can starting around 45.
---
Rogue is an amazing class.   Even though I plan to play priest in classic I want a rogue alt for stealth,  lockpicking, and pvp hunting.   People tend to hate on rogues for being scary and attacking from stealth but for a rogue this is one of the best parts in pvp battlegrounds and world play.
---
That too. Had one fire mage with dragon breath, blastwave and frost nova. Didn’t spell interrupt/ sheep  a single mob.
---
Eh, it's not always a bad thing. With a PUG tank who doesn't mark targets, if you move and then drink, he's going to pull while you're at 10% mana and then wonder why he's not getting healed.
---
With a lot of tanks, you gotta pump the brakes the entire instance, and that's one way to do it.
---
how do i get rid of the class icon in luna unit frames?
---
WoWModelViewer
---
Then why are you jumping around with only 25% mana right before the boss when every one else is full health and mana?
---
That's a beefy goal my friend, I wish you the best of luck!
---
You can not save Retail WoW.
---
Runescape released the old version of the game and it became more popular than the new version. OSRS thrived and grew after Jagex began added more content to it. Players preferred the Classic version, but it was necessary to add more content to keep it growing.
---
Classic will likely have more subs than Retail after launch.
---
Are you actively trying to be dumb?
---
I know you understood what i mean, so stop pretending to be retarded.
---
But in case you actually are that dumb ill just write it again.
---
Its about how THE GAME works, not how people play it.
---
Worlds buffs where an alternative for players during vanilla, only try hards using them doesnt change the fact that the option to use them was there.
---
So for no changes that option has to be left in the game.
---
Unfortunately for you the world buffs will be in the game so either you suck up and get them or accept that you will have lower dps than the people who get them.
---
Imagine playing the game as a pure slugfest where no one uses CC to land a kill.
---
Oh wait, cleave metas that do exactly that are fucking aids.  People moaning about healers in arena is fucking hilarious.
---

---
Was quite hard to find I'll admit. The interview with Omar and John heights shows that they will listen to the community on what is the way to go afterwards. It was in the context of tbc, but they definitely remained vague. Obviously, every thing is for post naxx, so we got time to see it evolve.
---
Yes it is. Melee leeway is bad for the game.
---
Well if you played a healer back then and got used to those addons you are going to play a different class with much more "spells" and keybinds and strategy...
---
Bartender does this.
---
They don't *have to*, though. If they want to be competitive in damage, then they can CHOOSE to.
---
It's a ridiculous thing to compete on, imo. Kind of like a hot dog eating competition or something. Or being able to piss the farthest. If they want to compete in such a ridiculous thing, well... they can, but they shouldn't try to change the game for everyone just to make it easier for them.
---
Shockadin isn't a real thing until TBC.
---
You aren't going to get many helpful answers in any serious thread about pallies doing damage (as evident in this thread). The truth is that they are easily kited and outside of HoJ burst and seal of command procs they really don't do a ton of damage. You can outlast people in pvp, or heal some other class that deals damage to win fights reliably.
---
Bestial swiftness doesn’t stack with dash, so no point having both
---
&gt; balancing the entire game around something that ~0.5% of the population participated in was kind of stupid.
---
To be clear, are we talking about PvE or PvP?  Because that statement could apply to both.
---
AoE grinding you need the extra INT for more blizzard casts. You OOM too quickly if you go full on spell power and try to AoE grind.

Likely? It was a guarantee you'd be OOM after using Fort/shadow protection &amp; IF. Same for Mage with int/armour/shield &amp; if you're lucky a mana gem.
---
I had the same goal.
---
Saw the classic collector's edition, ordered it and now I'm hyped for it.
---
Agreed, undead for pvp. Otherwise Orc is your class can be Orc for the stun resist.
---
I'm worried about your very first statement if you want to be a main tank "average guild that doesn't wipe in easy content". You are already sounding like you're better then everyone and that's not a good quality as a main tank.
---
The main tank is the rock of the guild, if people mess up the tank keeps his cool and keeps motivation up. As MT, 99% of the wipes are because of other players and if that's going to bug you....please don't MT.
---
To your other points though...
---
- MT is usually required to be on almost 24/7 to help other guildies do dungeons and attunements and gear up for raids. Blacksmith and engineering wouldn't be advisable because you need a steady stream of cash for repairs, gear upgrades, yatta yatta so you should really consider gathering profs. You cant farm as a tank when your guild needs help doing dungeons.
---
-Because of the time commitment, MT is always showered with gear first. It is the reward and it will help the guild the most. Better tank=less heals needed/dps can go more aggressive=shorter boss fights.
---
-Everyone "wants" to be a MT but few people have the time or patience, its a important role!
---
Find a guild, make new friends. level fishing and cooking to max.

---
I can’t bring myself to level Warriors or Rogues. Self healing or pet tanking is just a crutch I lean on far too heavily.
---
I’ve always thought of just leveling a warrior through RDF, but then I’m reminded of how terrible that can be in its own right. And I can’t get a Rogue past 19 twink status.
---
Even on EverQuest Progression servers I toggle on the old models, but I'm all about that nostalgia a e s t h e t I c.
---
You are the only one being a "whiney elitest fuck" on this thread.
---
I think I liked BC class mechanics better.
---
I really don't see any argument for this. Blizzard can pretty much do whatever they want.
---
&gt; Classic will likely have more subs than Retail after launch.
---
I disagree, but even if it does, that won't be enough. It needs 2x the subscriptions before Blizzard starts considering it a priority over retail.
---
This was even before that! A few patches in, with the introduction of Meeting Stones, you also had the ability to join these dungeons from afar. Let's say a simple LFG (you still had to travel to the dungeon yourself though)
---
In this instance my character joined the same group twice, duplicating myself, and well, causing some bugs.
---
thats so fucking smart damn
---
We have a clear explanation from the Code of Conduct.
---
You liking it or not doesn't mean shit.
---
Well, sort of. 
---
Now since I said that I have to first say Im a massive Keanu fan since the Matrix movies, but his acting _range_ isnt that wide. He plays a specific type of character, and plays it extremely well. But you’re not casting him in a rom com or something like Full Metal Jacket.
---
My favorite class is Shaman, but since I've cleared everything except Naxx on a shaman and I'm going alliance this time 'round I'm rolling a lock.
---
Not really.
---
Google Sheets and a DKP system based on nDKP that Navak and I have engineered.
---
Happens to me a lot, a lot of what I remember in Vanilla was actually pre-tbc patch lol
---
Played hunter in vanilla -&gt; wrath, switched to shaman then eventually monk. Love healing so hunter is out of the question.  
---
I think priest or shaman again, the shapeshifting for Druid doesn’t seem like my thing and I prefer horde
---
That's ridiculous.  I've literally never even heard of loot council being used in this manner, to only give loot to top damage dealers. That's such a red herring, and I'm certain you know that. You're just grasping at straws in attempt to win the argument.
---
Well you are already going for tailoring, so it's really your choice. During the early crunch nodes are going to be hard to get, but this also means that prices for stuff will be very cheap because the market will be flooded and most players won't have much money. 
---
I'd probably try out herbalism because there's in general more herbalism nodes than mining nodes , but if it turns out it's too much work to get nodes I'd do alchemy. Alchemy is one of the crafting professions you can actually make some money on, and everyone always needs buffs. It also makes you more valuable in group content - give everyone in your party a role appropriate potion before you do the instance and you'll build up a good reputation.
---
Well this settles it! I’m going human! Thanks man!
---
Point of service?
---
Okay, so how does this prove that no one has a flask.  Assuming that I believe that's even you.
---
Kill KT.
---
&gt;What is expected of the main tank in terms of time commitment to the guild ? Are there/will there be guilds who clear most content on 2x raids a week?
---
Yes, there will be guilds who clear up-to-date content on 2x week. As for time commitment, well that both depends on the guild and whether or not content is "on farm." Ultimately, you'd probably be able to find a guild that suits your availability.
---
&gt;I enjoy farming, but how many hrs need to go into prep for raids? How many gold do consumables for a raid cost on p servers? Would an alt (mage/hunter) be a good idea?
---
Again, depends on whether or not content is "on farm" and also depends on the guild as well as what phase you're in because DM buffs, and other things open up in later phases. A casual guild will require you to more or less bring a flask, show up on time and make sure your shit is repaired. A hardcore guild can expect tubers, consumes, flasks, specific professions, fishing buffs, Juju buffs etc. It comes down to you finding something that suits you.
---
&gt;How competitive is the main tank scene? Do off tanks every try hustle their way into main tank?
---
I feel like I'm going to be saying this a lot but again, it depends on the guild. For the top hardcore guilds the main tank(s) and the DPS warriors are almost interchangeable depending on where you're at for content and you'll be expected to show up with both sets of gear and change roles depending on the fight. For more normal guilds, it's a very competitive scene, not because of the hustle but just because they don't need many dedicated tanks. So you go from the 5-Man phase where everyone and his uncle wants a tank, to the 40-man phase where you're suddenly tank saturated.
---
&gt;Is the loot distribution pretty unfair on the off tanks? Do they get MT scraps?
---
If the guild has loot council, more or less yes. If the guild has DKP, no.
---
&gt;What tips would you give someone who wants to MT?
---
Be prepared for your grinding to take forever unless you have two gear sets, be prepared to get a thousand whispers a day, be prepared to be asked by guildies to do content you don't need yourself all the time. Most importantly though, don't be afraid to sell runs to non-guildies.
---
&gt;What professions should a main tank take? I thought engineering and blacksmith.
---
Unless you're gonna be playing hardcore that's a pretty unusual combination to take. Mining is almost always a good idea for a tank because if you go for Thunderfury, and you should. You're gonna need 100 Arcanite bars.
---
&gt; so stop pretending to be retarded.

Listen, spergladite. You are saying nochanges is literally related to game function - why? Why is this the position, and not related to keeping the vanilla experience as close as possible? Also, what qualifies you to make this assertion? I just want to quote everything you say and respond with "big of true" but you probably wouldnt get it. 
---
What kind of autism reasoning is NO THE ACTUAL CODING MUST BE THE SAME REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE. You really haven't justified your position at all besides "NOCHANGES REFERS TO CODE" which isn't a justification. Stop defending toxic private server practices, please.

We found the guy who’s fun a parties. Can you pass me a beer broski?

Those are ok for 5 mans but aren't viable for raids. Shams heal.
---
How long does it approximately take to complete the war effort? I know it'll depend on server pop, guilds holding out on turn ins...
---
I think the only thing i do not like about the beta is that I'm dying to play classic and all I can do right now is watch streamers enjoying themselves on beta and experiencing all of the stuff I am looking forward to before I can access it.
---
OP I get your concern,  does having an extended beta damage the viability of the game when it comes out?  I think for me it does a little because I can't stay hyped for the game for months on end.  I want it naow.
---
Should watch me when Classic comes out.

I'm kinda struggling as raiding is not a possibility for me anymore, kids etc. Raiding was always my main goal in vanilla and I hated PVP.

I Guess I'll just try and improve my character as much as possible without it and aim for epic mount and alts.

How did you make this entire post without mentioning 25%, twentyfive fucking % stun resist.
---
I didn't read the title and I thought this was a sarcastic post of someone finally being able to acquire a Linen Cloth.
---
This isn’t 2006 anymore. Only bad hunters stick wolves next to themselves and spam howl. The “you don’t use hunter pets in raids because they die to AoE” is a meme and there are only a few bosses per tier that are an actual threat to pets. It’s entirely a *you* issue if your pet dies on the rest of the fights.
---

I literally linked our 1st Cthun kill (killed 3 days after it was nerfed to actually be killable).  And no one is using any consumables let alone flasks.
---
What proof do you want ?  I mean that's my Youtube channel and my videos.  You can see the channel name is the exactly same as my username.
---
Just let your guild know from the start that you want a good 2H at some point. Most of the recruiting posts mention PVP premades in addition to raiding schedules so they will need an warrior capable of respecting arms. Might as well be you.

Imagine being this retarded, holy shit.

Depends on the group really.

For most leveling dungeons of you're an appropriate level and you're pulling correctly there are only a couple of pulls where the healer should need to drink.

You can chain pull almost entire dungeons and the healer should be 5 second ruling it the whole time.

Blizzard can't save Retail WoW. It is a sinking ship that crashed years ago. Blizzard has the opportunity to gain back millions of players they lost over years of awful changes made to retail.
---
There is a serious lack of a decent MMORPG. Players will come back to Classic, but I doubt most will stay long unless more content is added.
---
You can improve things like shadows, view distance, anti aliasing etc but it’s the vanilla models and textures.  
---
I agree it would be great to toggle between the two but currently not a thing
---
It's exciting to me it got boring just slicing through 8 or 9 out of 10 of the opposing faction and only having 1-2 people who can  even realistically oppose me. If I twink it won't be for awhile though that shit was expensive and time consuming.
---
Always forget it was in until 1.1, but at least they have a mob-type specific CC :|
---
How on earth is a new player supposed to know which specs are bad before they play the game?
---
Why would you even post that answer? Fucking mongoloid

Karen, Kimberly, Kaylee/Kayleigh, Kelly.

With a guild called &lt;Venti Machiatto&gt;
---
Chill bra.
---
&gt;and not related to keeping the vanilla experience as close as possible?
---
So where do you draw the line for how people can play the game? Do you want changes that stops spelladins from being usable because they werent "part of the experience"?
---
Giving people the game as it was is the only thing blizzard can do, they cant dictate how people will play it.
---
If they remove world buffs guilds might implement that you arent allowed to raid unless you have a flask, which wasnt the case during vanilla either.
---
So at that point would you want to remove flasks aswell?
---
Why are you still replying, is this is the only attention you get or something?
---
No, hunters counter rogues. Vs mage its 50/50 unless you open on max range. You lose to locks and priests 100%.
---
The preorder for the blizcon statues ends on the 19th. Just google 2019 wow blizcon collectible
---
Where is the source that states Blizzard never intended world buffs to be used in a raid and was an exploit? Pretty sure if they thought it was an exploit it would of been patched long ago. To even call this game mechanic an exploit is just being obstinate.
---
Hell, you basically needed these buffs to help clear Naxx since it was tuned in such a way.
---
REEEE
---
Mage. It’s too boring. All you are is a set of ranged frostbolts. Other classes have cool melee attacks, or healing reduce attacks or something
---
You have a great point, but the warrior class has one of the highest skill ceilings for any class in the game. That’s why I roll warrior, I’ve had a lot of fun learning new tricks. Warrior can go from worst leveling class to one of the best if you set yourself up for success (based on weapons, talents, playstyle, etc.) If you take sweeping strikes you can kill two mobs faster than you can kill one, it’s sick.
---

---
iirc they have one of the longest stun duration. As with all other grenades, you just want them for the cc factor. The damage of all bombs is pretty pathetic.
---
Right? What an entitled idiot that guy is.

When you start a run just say/ask that you'll be needing on str/agi items too, most people will not make a problem out of it.

Hey buuuud! I also had similar questions and I found a podcast that went super into detail about druids in classic. It's the "Count Down to Classic" episode 46 titled "Feral Druid with Shedo" or something. To reallllllllly make an impact on DPS though feral druids need to farm the "crowd pummeler" weapon from gnomeragan. Weapon damage doesn't effect feral DPS however the clicky proc is a huge attack power buff (only has 3 charges that last 30 seconds) that you pop on boss fights. Most feral druids would carry 12+ of them per raid. More if you're wiping on bosses. More casual raiding you might not need to farm it. 
---
Here's the Spotify link to the podcast https://open.spotify.com/episode/55Vd7OEcYmrrZitNZjztFF?si=Qrmc6LHASUOCsSwYlqMJGg
---
What would have been really cool is if you had a player character in the left side of the screen just looking up in awe.
---
For vanilla clients? how? I have had it installed and typed /kb, and it does nothing. Typing /bartender, I have found nothing of that nature in the options list. I haven't found an actual GUI options menu yet.
---
Is that the tauren gal npc who walks the main road?
---
Yeahhhhh
---
Shaman healers only?
---
Farming flasks requires people to play - im good with this.
---
Farming world buffs requires people to LOG OFF - im not good with this. You get this yet? I want this to be as big a community as possible with an experience as close to retail as reasonable. Autism positions like THE CODE DOESNT MATCH be damned.

To have every char level 60 :) will definitely take some time lol

Seen this term a lot but idk what it means, can you elaborate on BIS for me? Thanks
---
Retail WoW has a lot of great things about it. If you don't think Classic has anything to learn there, you're delusional.
---
Or layers and you can just wait until they’re gone. If it’s only gonna be a week then layering will only be in a week.
---
nah.
---
I've never raided, just messed around during vanilla, but this time I want to try it.   
---
I plan to learn all the fights before going into them, play best talent spec for my role, and be prepared to farm for required raid buffs. I think that's the minimum required. That and getting as geared as I can pre raiding, even if that requires a lot of time. Don't want to be the one singled out due to gear if the raid's wiping.
---
If I want to have shadowpriest raid fun, I'm doing that on an alt to do dungeons, and maybe the easiest raid content once everyone has it on farm. With the plan to be as geared as possible to make up somewhat for a fun spec.
---
\&gt; I'm not wrong
---
\&gt;is massively wrong
---
I agree, you better bring an army.
---
I’ll enjoy my instant bg ques. When that phase releases. Alliance for life my friends.
---
Also the 5% pet damage is like only useful to hunters
---
Take down C’thun and clear Naxx. My guild had only just reached C’thun once and killed a spider wing boss of Naxx before BC released.
---
I think tier 1 bracers are boe so shaman and pally epics I believe
---
My favorite class is math, because logic.
---
Im going to build everything around getting atiesh.  Literally everything,  my class, my guild I will be running,  my raid schedule.   It will all be to be one of the few who will acquire a legendary item.
---
What do you think of NE rogues? I want to roll one as my main but I'm worried that I might gimp myself if I do... Humans are technically better for PvE and I'll have to deal with the Orc stun resist.
---
Wishful thinking is an amazing thing. Blizzard have consistently *avoided* saying that, while making comforting but vague noises about "an authentic Blizzard-quality experience" to placate people.
---
Has it occurred to you that there was never a time in real vanilla where there were 1.12 mechanics but no battlegrounds?
---
The people downvoting him are RPing as well.
---
Game of Thrones was bad because it was intentionally rushed. Writers wanted to do 7 seasons maximum but were convinced to do one more season. They had enough of it and are working on other projects with George R.R. Martin and they all knew the last season would suck because they had to cram content of 3 seasons into 1.
---
No one with a brain would not use a Flask on the MT on progression.  Guilds should have a ton of gold.   Your story is not believable.
---

The first Priest I leveled in tBC was in Holy spec. It was a atrocious experience and it took me over a year to level. I didn't hit max until ICC was released.
---
You're entire argument hinged on the words "a lot" which was strangely dropped in the post where you called me an idiot. Maybe its because you can't prove your previous assertion. Thanks for getting hostile though, sperg.
---
I don't agree. The 'Classic experience' isn't about fighting 1000's of other players at the same time for the same mobs and collectibles, that's just a nuisance. I'm not really seeing the fun factor when looking at 100's of players lining up waiting for the same quest collectible to spawn, and even with layering this will be an issue to a more limited degree.
---
I loved classic &amp; TBC and I sure as hell don't look forward to a release without layering where entire servers are cropped into the same few zones making the game unplayable for its first few weeks of release. 
---
There's a major difference between it being 'difficult' and it being so much of a hassle that getting to level 10 might take days of playing because you're fighting too many others for spawns. That's just not fun at all, and is definitely not an element of the greatness of classic.
---
Not true at all. I came here and stated what I experienced in vanilla and got bashed to hell and back for it. May have lost a bit of patience after being constantly insulted, but I never came in here acting elitist.
---
Not if they funnel all dying servers into a pvp heaven of a super server in a concept like seasonal play.
---
That's right, delete your comment you little bitch
---
test
---
Looks like most of the people in support of this are raid-day loggers. Who just want to log on for 2 days, 3 hours each and get gear. If your guild is at a progression stage, especially at AQ40 &amp; Naxx then you need all the buffs you can to push content. Sure if it's on farm status and a good majority of your guild has a gear from that raid you can slack a little, but if you just want things removed so you can coast on other people's work so you don't have to put time in yourself, you're in for you a surprise when either you can't clear things or benched for players willing to put time in to get world buffs, all the consumables, enchants, etc so they can be the best possible.
---
Warrior, by far. It's the class that requires you to have the best gear, the class that rewards you the most for having said gear. It's a class that you really feel like your attention to detail is rewarded, in a way that it's really just not as the other non pure dps classes. Sure, rogue is similar, but then, you are one of like 8 rogues that wants to get into every dungeon group. 
---
I have tried leveling as a druid, but to be honest, I didn't like it at all. I was both vastly more powerful but felt like I had much less in terms of a safety net. I went from having the tools to survive a double pull, to that being my default state, but if anything went WRONG during the double pull, having no tools to back out with at all.
---
I like how in Skyrim you can choose your “dominant hand” and Left and Right hands are considered basically equal.  Should be used in more games IMO.
---
It would add another dynamic to PvP as well.
---
Why are you so adamant that it's optimal to log off after getting buffs?
---
Nah layering isn't a change
---
&gt;Farming flasks requires people to play - im good with this. Farming world buffs requires people to LOG OFF - im not good with this. You get this yet?
---
Ofc i get what you are saying, i dont understand how it will affect you though, you seem like a really unlikable guy so a community wont be something youll have to worry about.
---
If you dont like to log off to preserve world buffs then dont, there is no need to remove the option for others because you dont like it.
---
Keeping world buffs gives the option for tryhards to use them and the casuals like yourlsef to not use them.
---
Removing them only forces the casual playstyle on everyone, and i dont like that.
---
See you in classic, ill get a few extra world buffs in honor of you.
---
Your salt will make me more inclined to get them, so i thank you for that.
---
Its pretty significant against casters in pvp tho right? That knockback on casts
---
As a career priest, this hits me. However, as a moonlighting tank, the fact that I don't pull if my healer is less than 20% Mana, or call out "pulling on healers Mana" is so beyond welcome. I've had healers go bonkers after finishing a 5man and just tag along with quests. Shit dies faster, and quest grind uptime hits overdrive.
---
DKP at least awards items based on attendance.  
---
I don't get why some people are annoyed that people who show up more often would get more stuff.
---
Neckbeards have girlfriends?
---
There will be so many people at launch, along with guilds, you won't have a problem if you play the best you can and show up on time for raids.
---
Don't worry about it.
---
A raid will usually take 1 enhance shaman but elemental runs out of Mana too fast and doesn't do enough dps in first tier raids. It'll be another situation where you'll want to go resto to get into a raid group in month 1, gather dps gear and switch in phase 2. You'll be at the bottom of the item chain though. You could go super sweaty try hard to play enhance in raid but it'll be hard to get into a group since a hardcore group will bring maybe 1.
---
It’s true.  Human Footmen, as well as the UD Death Knight here were left handed.
---
Your wrong because your brain can't handle the idea that players want a different experience. You gotta try to take off the googly eye glasses and realize this isn't the same players. Stop goofing off. Real replies only.
---
Look I'm not going to argue with you because it's pointless.  If you don't believe literal video evidence I don't know what else to say.
---
Nah man, because he's no lifing a 15 year old game his opinion obviously matters more than anyone else's! /S
---
Some unit frame mods would do that.  Also, there was a dressing room mod that would do it.
---
I'm surprised you're getting upvotes for spreading misinformation.
---
The real way to get the max rank water ( lvl 55) is from a dire maul quest that requires you to kill a boss after accepting it, here's the actual quest info :
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?quest=7463](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=7463).
---
Which means you will not be able to learn this until dire maul comes out, so not for a few months.

I would rather have a slower slugfest with mana management rather than less impactful abilities and only focussing on CC timing. But I guess that's why I'm in this in this subreddit.
---
Mages.
---
I mained a Holy Priest and my brother mained a Mage all throughout WoW.   
---
Never felt the need or inclination to roll a DPS Caster during this time.
---
Even though both of us are coming back for Classic and will relive our glory days I think it's time to at least roll an alt to help me AoE farm.... Plus I can start repaying him back all that water he fed me for years :P
---
Not for long! 💪
---
And they're wildly inaccurate. Heed My Call is supposed to hit for like 4500, and it will crit for 30k
---
https://youtu.be/vXvyjnDmyhw
---
Watch the vid for hunter tips, read the forum post he has in the description for rotation tips
---
that's slower, if you're in a comfortable group there is no need to sit around eating as a tank, especially if u have a mage in the group giving everyone expendable water
---
Have you ever ran a dungeon? You don’t sit there, you keep progressing through it. Also there’s jack shit the group can do about totems having a shorter duration than pally blessings.
---
I'm not saying its unbalanced, I'm saying its not fun.
---
my advice:
---
do as little research into the game as possible, just enjoy the sense of discovery as you play. obviously your friends are going to help you along, but imho you will have a lot more fun going in as blind as possible and learning as you go as opposed to having things 'mapped out', so to speak.
---
Loot Lists use attendance too, it's just not such a big variable. There are tons of issues with DKP.
---
SL Lock with Paladin healer beats Warrior with Paladin healer, easily.
---
I wonder how people managed to get over it in 2004.
---
I'm not sure whether it would be few days or few weeks of almost-unplayability - kinda makes a difference.
---
&gt; you seem like a really unlikable guy 
---
&gt;casuals like yourlsef
---
&gt;Your salt will make me more inclined to get them
---
All said unironically, I'm sure.
---
It's acceptable if only a few do it and you're not having problems with the current raid boss.  
---
Lean too hard into fun and you'll hurt your chances of victory, but as long as everyone knows the fights a few fun specs shouldn't be a problem a lot of the time. It's only a problem, if it's actually a problem.   
---
I'm planning to level two druids to save respec costs (in addition to two priests), one moonkin the other resto. Moonkin for fun, to get what raids I can in a more casual guild and resto for more reliable raiding. That way I can use moonkin for runs to get new guild members geared, for content we've got on farm.    
---
It will be a lot slower than sticking to one main, but there's no rush and it should let me raid with fun builds occasionally.
---
My favorite thing to do was ask people in their 40's who didn't have mount to help me in the zone they get it.  Then if they were willing to venture out to help I would buy them.
---
The videos aren't evidence of anything.   It sure as fuck doesn't show who has a flask on.
---
Thank you. I'm still worried about the Orc stun resist though... Seems so overpowered in PvP.
---
Easy, shaman. Especially once enh gets dual wield in tbc
---
Opposite for me.  I was mainly in serious/hardcore guilds from vanilla through cata, and every guild that didn't run some form of attendance reward ended up dying due to some extreme drama.  Everything went fine in the beginning when just the MT and 1-2 healers were getting priority.. but when you start taking it beyond that... people get pissed off very quickly.
---
A lot of what determines the success of loot council is RNG of drops.  If a DPS waits 3 months to see an item drop, but some other guy who attended less raids (but is better DPS) gets that item, then you better believe that the more dedicated player is going to jump ship more often than not. 
---
I would count your scenario as a lucky one.
---
transmog only visible to the transmogger then?
---
If debuff limit was increased it would make some classes more viable in raids.  If HP was adjusted accordingly I think it would be a nice change.  It wouldn’t make a balance Druid top the charts but being able to not be a complete liability would be a good start.  I believe the debuff limit was put into place in vanilla due to hardware constraints which is no longer an issue.  The problem would be proper balancing with those changes.
---
Any race/class is playable in Classic WoW even by a beginner. Warrior would probably be the most difficult class in the game since you rely more on other people, especially during leveling. But don't let difficulty let you hold off from playing the class you think is the coolest/ you enjoy playing the most.
---
It's from a healers POV and he clicks on about everyone in the raid at least once. 
---
Look at there buffs.....
---
No flasks or any other consumables.
---
I don't need to cite anything for you. If you don't understand that people want "Classic" to be just like Vanilla was, then there's something wrong with you.
---
You can have any opinion you want. But to not know that people don't want changes, and the slippery slope that comes with it, is just bizarre. 
---
What else should we remove? You don't like hunters, so we should remove them, too?
---
Google “Classic DB” and search all 2 handed weapons. Sort them by leveled required and find all the weapons that you can reliably obtain (basically items from quest rewards and not random drops). And you REALLY want to make sure you have a slow 2 hander and you hamstring kite, otherwise you’re going to be eating after every single pull.
---
To not reach 60 for a while. I loved raiding in original, but I liked the path to 60 even more. Soon as I hit 60, I'll probably stop playing that character. I do not have the time commitment to do raiding now
---
Yep it was a huge mistake.
---
For reference to anyone who thinks Crusader Strike was an addition to paladins post-vanilla, it was actually available in the classic beta. It was removed because paladins were 'OP' at the time (They were...)
---
This seems a little extreme. I will not be on 24/7.
---
Sarcasm right?
---
I mean it’s just not fun to watch a bunch of guys dance around pillars for an hour until a healer messes up a cool down or goes oom.
---
I know that there’s much more to arena than that but for a casual viewer like me that’s what it looks like. 
---
Why would I ever watch it if I can watch a smash tourney, counter strike or league of legends?
---
Absolutely.
---
Im glad i got to meet you, the game will be much more enjoyable now that i know you will be miserable playing it.
---
You have a fair bit of leftover mats after leveling engi with mining. You could probably farm for both of you and have the secondary roll herbalism or something. There's not much point in both of you leveling mining.
---
Seasonal servers are an option with content cycles.
---
When they thru mana away for non healers, game's days were numbered. 
---
Number just finally got called is all.
---
Make friends as you level. Tank well in dungeons for them.
---
I know people like to rip on ret but I think you only have two choices. Basically going 0/25/26 with Reckoning to stop rogues that crit you often or set up reck bombs, or even though people called me useless a lot, I ran with [this build.](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/AvADATwEzJ9M3Q) It has 10% less chance to get gouged/feared/blinded (which might not seem like much, but anything helps!), extra hit chance, so you don't miss as many autos, since rets rely heavily on autos. Repent so you can repent + SoC for decent damage. Vindication for when you need to debuff the target and 15% is no joke. And last but not least Eye for an Eye. It's gonna be hard fighting a caster, but if you can manage to hurt them a bit without reaching them, (since 30% of a 1k hit is 300 damage, and most casters won't be rocking a lot of HP), it will make them easier targets for your allies.  
---
Downside is people will laugh at you but it feels really nice when you get an auto crit + SoC proc and then the enemy goes "wtf, I just lost over 1k+ of my hp?" as a fresh 60.
---
and portals.  being able to teleport your group or yourself to the major cities is an incredible convenience
---
The issue with loot council from my perspective (in anything other than a hardcore guild) is that you are rewarding less dedicated players (potentially) who show up to less raids, over people who show up every week on time all of the time, despite not being quite as good.  
---
Attendance rewards are a neutral way of handling loot distribution.
---
Priority rewards is always a risky affair and can cause some serious guild drama over time.  If you use this in anything other than hardcore guilds that want to push to be the best, then it is going to end poorly.  
---
This is why people need to be specific when they discuss this subject.  Guild types matter heavily.
---
Agreed, its too technical for anybody but other arena nerds to enjoy. Its an esport nobody but Gladiator and Rank One players can enjoy.
---
Now you can look great while refreshing everyone’s two minute buffs and healing sometimes!
---
I prefer the term 'Action Casino'
---
It's as good as useless at all levels for pvp.
---
Shaman, I just love chain heal too much
---
&gt;I don't want to be in that guild. Thats not fun for me.
---
That guild sounds more casual, but isn't.    
---
It's the guild that chose to walk through the forest off the road, because "its more fun". Then they get lost and wonder why their progress is so slow and hard.   
---
But at least they don't have to farm for consumables! they just have to bash their heads against a wall over and over and over and over...   
---
Fun builds are great when you're not having problems taking down bosses, if people can do it that's all good, but I imagine it gets frustrating after the 50th time of wiping to the same boss.
---
Top tier guilds are the only ones who should be using loot council lol...
---
Any casual/semi casual/semi serious or even most serious guilds shouldn't be risking their guild falling apart when they aren't pushing to be the absolute best.

---
fucking same. Thanks for finally agreeing, its exhausting getting you dumbasses to stop voting against your own interests. Stacking world buffs wasn't a thing in vanilla, because that level of autism apparently took another 15 years to foster. The process of stacking these buffs requires you to logoff to preserve the timer, and **if** all of the pserver athletes are to be believes, of the 20 minute youtube video made on this topic is to be believed, it will be an expectation. This will very much be unlike vanilla wow.

I can't wait for you to unironically continue to argue with me when I am literally agreeing with your entire premise on keeping vanilla as it was.

They are completely viable in 5 mans and very much sub optimal in raids. Mainly due to the fact they have no taunt and go out of mana quickly.
---
How does someone make an addon? Never understood how.
---
Wow, you dont have a clue what you are talking about if you think people farmed AV for honor. AV is literally the worst bg in the game to farm honor in, because honor farming is done through win bonuses if that is what a person is after.
---
How old were you when vanilla wow was out?

Well then dps so you get dps gear stop being greedy

The big issue is they dont have a taunt.  Something gets away from you it's harder to pick up.  They are useless for tank swap fights.
---
&gt; How viable are these tanks in 5 man dungeons? What are their actual strengths and weakness's? 
---
Oh well, you see the problem is...
---
&gt; Don't tell me they can't tank anything when I know they can.  
---
Wait. If you already know about prot paladins, why did you make this thread?
---
What other alternative are there?
---
Oh?  I know they are in the beta, I haven't heard them planning on removing the minor UI updates.
---
I figure if I grow mine long enough, I won't have to wear a shirt anymore. No shirt, less laundry. Conceivably, birds could start living in it, a la Peter Griffin. This should scare away my girlfriend, thus sparing me precious time breaking up with her. Quitting my job is easy enough - just turn off my phone, and that problem takes care of itself.

You literally said in the second paragraph you know they are viable, then went on to ask whether they are viable in the 3rd paragraph. What exactly are u actually asking?
---
I don't know everything about them by any stretch. I just want a more detailed answer than someone telling me they can't tank anything when I know that they can.

Any insight?

You can only see like 8 buffs at a time... Everyone has far more than that in a raid...
---
Best in slot.  
---
Pretty much best item you can get for your class/spec, at some point in game.
---
I don't think anyone would ever argue a Prot Pally can't tank 5 mans.  Heck, I've seen people play shaman tanks in 5 mans and do just fine.
---
It's just that most people think in terms of raids as the true end game. 
---
If you have a prot pally and only ever want to tank 5 mans, you'll be able to do it all day.
---
Enjoying the ride to level 60. Again and again.
---
I'm asking about their specific strengths and weakness's as tanks in a 5 man environment and if there's a gate campaign against them
---
You also need to factor in shatter.  Frost mages have +50% crit vs frozen targets and crits deal double damage so on a crit so instead of critting for 480 you will be critting for 660.  While leveling if you have a high mana pool you need to drink 2 water per sit instead of 1 so there is 30 seconds saved every time  you oom.
---
i really doubt youll find much hate for them in 5 mans they can handle those dungeons just fine.       
---
the hatred towards them largely applies to them raid tanking and being unable to generate anywhere near the same threat as warrior / druid.

Considering the gear they give you I don’t think it’s possible or even really plausible   The whole point of fury tanking is threat generation with the gear they give everyone 1. No one has enough hit rating. And 2. No ones doing crazy dps to test if it can hold threat and 3. The healing gear is pretty terrible so it’s probably hard to keep fury tanks up.       Just my assumptions since I don’t have beta

I didn’t mean to sound as though I’m better than people. What I meant is I want to be in a guild that has some direction. Wiping is fine, but making the same mistakes constantly &amp; not progressing is frustrating. I guess the word of choice is “efficient.”

Clear AQ-40 and get full AQ-40 gear and weapons. Get to at least rank 12 or rank 13 if possible. I know rank 14 is out of the question because of the time commitment. These are all things I never did in Vanilla and would like the chance to do them in Classic.
---
&gt;Preferably more relaxed guilds will bring a ret pally, boomkin or shadow priest along
---
This is why I think alts are good for that. Have your shadow priest/boomkin as an alt in a casual guild.

*cries in Druid*
---
really impressiv!
---
You cant hold threat as there's no real aggro management on pally so everyone has to either do low dps or die. 
---
You can do it, especially in dungeons but you'd have to be overgeared, everyone will need to play differently and gimp themselves to accommodate you and it'll take longer. 
---
TLDR: Can be done and can be fun, it's just highly suboptimal.
---
Paladins.   
---
Smug, glowing douchebags all of them.
---
Ahh.. times were so much better then 😊
---
Legylass
---
You understand his point but sure, keep pretending that you think that you two agree.
---
You know that stacking buffs was possible during vanilla, which means you should be able to do the same in classic.
---
Just because you are such a casual that people merely try harding intimidates you doenst mean that in game changes should be made to cater to your playstyle.
---
You pretty much nailed it with the last comment on your post, they don't have taunt or crush cap. I had a prot set for 5 man groups but basically it's garbage. I literally was a paladin. You can get agro and take a beating fairly well, but you also run out of Mana really fast. So after every pull, you will likely need to drink. So it goes from pulling, pulling, pulling, pulling, wait 30 second... To pull, wait, pull, wait, pull, wait. It's a pain for everyone. It can be done in 5 man groups... But why? If your group is desperate they might do it... But it's pretty rough, so most will just dip out.
---
Armorsmithing has the benefit of the dark iron gear set and a few other more optimal rare patterns.  But,  as others have said, weapon smithing grants you the possibility of crafting more highly sought after axes.

There’s this neat concept called “give loot to the people that perform”. If you can’t be assed to pop consumeables or get wbuffs when everyone else is doing it, then you shouldn’t expect to get as much loot. DKP is for rewarding slackers.

---
We already know from experience from pservers that people enjoy ”fresh” or newly started servers. 
---
The reason (imo) being that it levels the playing field the same way a new expansion does which in turn generates hype.
---
My point being that any changes or additions aswell as eventual expansions should happen on seperate servers where you can copy over your characters (no fucking instant 60s for bc servers).
---
Or if they announce beforehand that a server will be ”progressive” or ”experimental” for example. 
---
That’s my opinion anyway.
---
Wtf are you talking about? I was in Vanilla! Yes, world buffs were a thing! And my guild didn't give a shit about them. Most guilds didn't. But people should be able to use/get them if they want.  What you're doing is basically campaigning to essentially "make them illegal"/removed from game which takes that choice away from those who want to get them. And that's what I'm against. Not that I give a shit about world buffs.
---
It doesn't matter what the process is. It was doable, and should still be doable.
---
how did you roll on loot as a ret pally healing?
---
From what I remember, 5 man's are fine, but you need to have DPS that can wait for you to build threat.
---
Gearing becomes an issue for raids because of lack of defense.
---
Lack of taunt as said.
---
Going oom.
---
Etc
---
They are perfectly viable tanks for all 5 man content. Their tanking issues are only for raids.
---
The guy fully understand what you mean but is "pretending" to be retarded. 
---
Just leave him be and enjoy the fact that he will be miserable playing classic while the rest of us enjoy the game as it was back in the days.
---
\&gt; This process is completed once when joining ONSLAUGHT. See the rules below for assigning values. These values may not be altered once set and are only effected by attendance modifiers after that point. 
---
doesn't work for new players even in the slightest
---
Stance Dance hustle
---
I never had any problems healing in enhancement spec during vanilla sure you needed to bring 60+ waters and drink every pull but that might just be my warrior friend always chainpulling. I stayed enhancement for the first couple of weeks after I hitt 60 to better be able to grind mats and rep between instance runs and it was totally fine healing wise
---
&gt;the game will be much more enjoyable now that i know you will be miserable playing it
---
I wish more trump supporters would admit this is exactly what they are thinking.
---
DP takes you out of shadowform, and stoneform does remove hunter stings
---
The content is so easy,  the world buffs only really matter if your guild is going for pure speed. You're either going to be using the ubrs fire res buff or using world buffs to make it go smoother. The content is 15 years old and their are no secrets left, not to mention the modern addons and macros. 
---
On the bright side tho,  if you are able to catch a raider on the way to a raid and kill said raider. Those are the best of times.
---
Yes, which means competing for loot with 7 other players
---
I’d love to roll on a server with twink guilds! I used to run with a guild called &lt;A Team&gt; on Terenas back in the day for 29s. Looking to roll either full shadow damage lock or holy pally :)
---
Kenion, favorite moviemaker ever
---
I enjoyed it a lot during BC. Sadly I don't remember much from Vanilla even tho I have Knight-Champion rank.
---
I was in that raid and that boss kill and I'm telling you that they didn't have any more buffs than was shown.
---
There was no UI limitation to showing only 8 buffs.  You are thinking about debuff slots when mobs could only have 8 debuffs (later increased to 16)
---
I'm not going to argue with you any more because it's pointless.
---
in vanilla i got to 1 to 60 with 0 addons and raided with also.....0 addons. i just laugh at the people using addons in classic tbh
---
For horde shaman definitely is NOT least played. The polls and pservers all suggest that shaman is one of the most played classes for horde.
---
Considering paladins are what makes alliance superior in pvp and pve...
---
Rogues... Rogues are for douchebags basically.
---
Then we have Hunters. They feel cheap to me.
---
Yes it will be one of the most played one
---
That is true but if you take a cat it would give you one extra talent point that you wouldn’t need to invest in bestial swiftness. Also I believe dash is 50% while bestial swiftness is 30%.
---
Collect all those rate pets.
---
I’ve seen alot of people using only the offhand while lvling.
---
But a decent wep with stam/int/spirit rolled on it is fine I guess, until you can get your hands on previously mentioned blues from dungeons.
---
Tanaris pirate Qs have alternative spell damage boots. Sure it is 10 levels later for comparable boots, but if you did not have any luck in gnome, they are worth taking.
---
You're right, I shouldn't waste my time. If I mentioned *the fucking moon*, he might ask for a citation to prove it exists. Cheers.
---
15 minutes
---
Please understand the context before replying. The question was "why dont you just start the raid 30 minutes earlier and get the buffs together"
---
Well, those who have time can do that.
---
But some days you cant do that. Sometimes you have to hurry just to get to the raid in time. Then you can use the "get the buffs and then log out til raid starts"
---
By not starting the raid 30 minutes early everyone can get the buffs
---
Yes sory wrong use of the word hard. I sould have said takes longer and costs more gold
---
Ony buff is melee AP only. WCB is melee haste. DM buff is melee AP as well afaik. 
---
Hunters get screwed over for wbuffs.
---
Considering there’s nothing to tank, no.
---
AV was the *only* content accessible for this weekend.
---
Is this a contest. Has the guy looked at warlock tiersets? Warrior gear was designed in crayon by someone who had a hard time not eating said crayons.
---
Lmao how childish
---
Van and drek??
---
Honestly, most people will probably only get to that level after dm comes out anyways  so probably wont be too bad
---
I would watch YouTube vids or check the sticky guides in this sub. You'll find soooooooooo much more info than any one comment will give ya.
---
It’s one of those threads where OP posts a question and then just argues with everyone who responds based on whether or not it’s what they want to hear. 
---
Only in this case OP forgot to not blatantly make that clear in the first post.
---
That’s been a big discussion with my friends, because we’ve always played Alliance since the launch of TBC, so on one hand, playing Alliance in Classic is a serious nostalgia trip and we’re used to the questing locations, but on the other hand playing Horde would be like a whole new experience.
---
And you know you'd be there for another 10 hours lol
---
Your friends sound like elitist try hards, play what's fun for you
---
Warrior. 
---
Only two classes in WoW. 
---
Warrior and support. 
---
If you’re not a warrior - you’re just the support ;)
---
Pally and war can level easily and since your friends just make an agreement to pool your gold for the warriors mount. Take herb on one and mining on the other.

---
Yeah I got a few pieces of judgement from MC while they were still derpy.  
---
The game was so chaotic back then
---
The healing gear is SO terrible that Pally’s get nothing but strength gear.
---
If by viable you mean "can technically clear an instance even though they're slower and shittier in literally every single way" then yes, that's true.
---
Sure, but that's not how Vanilla was designed, so that'll be the end of the original Vanilla experience.

Pink Hawkstrider
---
Clear BWL. Rank 8+ in pvp. Never really got beyond MC and Rank 8 back in vanilla.
---
Don't worry about difficulty. You've got 60 levels and countless hours to learn. Watch some "intro to wow classic" YouTube vids.
---
That's insane. Sorry I literally don't believe any guild operated this way. And if one did, it was such an extreme rarity (and probably a supremely tyrannical organization,  which would never survive the constant guild strife) that it's not even worth mentioning. Because you will find almost no one who would put up with that.
---
If you have bad raiders, that's one thing. But refusing to gear GOOD raiders who just don't have some buffs? Naw. Total straw man. 
---
We're not talking about consumables,  which is in the realm of reasonable expectations lots of people will put up with, or advocate for.
---
I think you're getting a little too angry and totally misunderstanding things.
---
People are going to be trying to get sulfuras long before ashkandi is available. Sulfuras also isn't something that people give to "who can use it the longest". Sulfuras is a guild wide achievement that takes a lot of work to get. It's not handed out based on who it's the best for, it's handed out based on who deserves it the most. People usually give it to their main tank first, because usually he's the raid leader and shows up every night. After that, it usually goes to whoever everyone thinks deserves it the most. Legendary weapons in classic aren't aquired the way they are in retail. They take 40+ people a long time to get, so it's always a guild wide achievement. You're not going to see people giving sulfuras out to shamans until AQ or Naxx comes out, because of the work that goes into getting it. 
---
Like i keep repeating, legendaries are given out to whoever the guild feels deserves it the most 90% of the time. Its very very rare for a guild to feel a melee shaman deserves sulfuras the most , so to be the person your guild is willing to give it to you need to put in the extra mile. 
---
Hell, 2 handed weapons in general are not given out on the basis on who it would benefit the most frequently. They're usually given out on the basis of DKP and whoever the guild feels deserves it because they don't benefit the raid as a whole very much because the specs that benefit from them the most are PvP specs. Warriors usually get first dibs because they can use them for PvP and because the main tank usually "deserves it". Then hunters usually get them because they're stat sticks. 
---
You can be angry and think shaman should get first grab at sulfuras all you want, but it isn't going to change how things work. You'll see over the next few years how rare it is for shaman to get it before the late phases.

I think you mislabeled your post. Saying “warlock DPS” implies PVE. For pvp warlocks are pretty damn strong with a lot of tools in their kit.

Ah ok, cool! I'll be leveling it with my husband so maybe with him around it won't be so bad, I just think it would be fun. Thanks!

I want to be a feral tank for classic.   When I am not tanking, I can switch to dps, heal, or debuff.   My question is what talent points are most important for feral kitty dps?

Hey guys!

**Guild Name - &lt;TRASH&gt;**
---
**Faction - Horde**
---
**Server Type - PvP**
---
**Region - EU**
---
**Guild Type - Social Raiding/Organised PvP**
---
I'm posting here in the hopes of generating a little interest in our guild for classic WoW.
---
While I appreciate it is relatively early to be advertising a guild I feel as though many players will need a hub of activity and social place to be during the first few weeks of launch and I aim to fulfil that need! It's never too early to surround yourself with people who have a mutual interest/mindset!
---
All the details of the guild can be found [here](https://trashguild.com/). Not every little thing such as scheduling/raid times are set out yet due to it being so early... but if the description of the guild sounds appealing to you then feel free to shoot an application my way!
---
Many thanks for taking the time to read.

\*ANGRY BUZZER NOISE\*
---
Ooh, maybe next time!
---
You need all ranks at naxx and in case of emergencies
---
Impossible.
---
I think of it the other way around. Classic was going there (and many of us players expected it to go there) but then TBC dropped and basically reset everything.
---
I think of it as classic having ended before it could have gotten to that point.
---
I don't know man, probably the same reason you are?
---
2 to 10 weeks.
---
If you want to gimp your dps and waste time watching the tank drink go ahead.
---
It’s viable in the same sense a hang glider is a viable airplane.
---
The first thing you should do is pick a race that you want to play, you will spend a ton of time looking at it in game so choose what you like the most.  Then pick the class that you like the most or vise versa.  Don't play what is 'meta" or "better" you will burn out or simply not enjoy the game as much.  Pick your name log in and go with the flow.

Lol that's pretty optimistic if you think layering will be gone that fast.

Paladin tanks are absolute garbage in raids.

Main spec is the general consensus.   People will frown on you rolling on shit they need.
---
Fury tanking isn't really viable until you have a ton of gear and max consumables.

Testing it in AV without any of that doesn't really make much sense.

Pre-60 just roll on whatever you need as everyone is just trying to level, but its also good to let the party know before you start.
---
Take a trip around the subreddit. Many people have discussed this before and I don't feel like answering lazy questions like this again.
---
I played during vanilla but when I decided to test out private servers for the first time I hit a wall hard at lv6 lol. I didnt realize how much games nowadays had changed me with all the constant rewards etc. 
---
I eventually got my shit together and leveled to 60 and the feeling of accomplishment in different stages of that journey blow all modern games out of the water imo. Ofcourse ruining my social and economic RL situation was a small price to pay.
---
"Perfect Condition!"
---
*Has a bit of a rip at the top in the middle right inside.
---
Priest. Always liked supporting. :)
---
Was enhancement good in TBC? I thought their damage sucked again? Especially in PvP.
---
This is my big thing. My friends want me to chill and "enjoy" the game. I cleared everything except naxx40  (and cthun) during initial release.
---
This time Im definitely min maxing so I can be better than I was back then.
---
dope, thanks for the answer
---
they can tank 5mans just fine but as has been said they dont have a taunt so that can make things harder especially if healer pulls from heal threat.
---
they also have to drink more than healers after each pull to put out good threat afaik.
---
i think gear is not optimized for them eg plate with spellpower
---
feral is fine in dungeons and raids afaik.
---
then general mindset is warrior if you want to tank unfortunately but thats with most ppl referring to raiding
---
Lol ok. 
---
Good conversation.
---
Why? And I asked about 5 man dungeons
---
Same optimism used in thinking the pop would drop low enough to play in a week without it.
---
Low threat, no taunt and again, you gotta waste time watching him drink.
---
My feral will get groups through in 2/3 the time at least.
---
I agree you don't wanna trivialize the world buy disagree wow does it to a point where its detrimental.
---
Druids are the underdog (undercat) class.
---
Same. :( At least they agree to rolling on a pvp server, so I can kill some dirty hor.. I can't bring myself to say it. /Tear
---
Where is the gnoam in the wolfshead helm as the little marvel rodent :D
---
Imagine watching someone play a video game you could play yourself
---
It’s just a lot harder for a lot of reasons.
---
I stand in solidarity with my vending machine brethren, tips for food and water or your suffering.
---
You are allowed to use it, but it implies that you think the majority thinks that way. I am saying it's silly to be snarky that you didn't *technically* claim that everyone wants it. Sure you didn't, but obviously you think everyone is or else you wouldn't have said it. Be real man.
---
The other person said its in the minority, both are making claims, you didn't have anything backing up your statement yet you asked for something to back that up minority. And I have looked at the forums, that is far from "everyone" wanting it on there, not to mention the plenty of people who don't even use the forums that you need to consider. If everyone truly wanted it, there would be much more noise about it. It can seem "everyone" wants what you want if that's all you are looking for.
---
Prevents death stacks. One guy 10 accounts kind of thing
---
There would never be thousands in the same zone. Stop the hyperbole. You have 6 starting zones, and a server cap. And people level at different speeds. 
---
But yeah, you were fighting for quests. Whats the big deal?
---
&gt;I understand that Prot warriors are the most optimal tanks in most circumstances
---
Warriors are THE ONLY viable tank in a lot of circumstances.
---
&gt;but can't understand why Prot paladins are labeled as "unviable" or even "useless" in comparison.
---
Because they can't tank encounters that Warriors can.
---
&gt;However, I have noticed that almost every forum post which asks about prot paladins or even feral druid tanks is immediately over run by people saying they should re-spec as healers if they want to get into groups or self proclaimed warrior mains shouting about how they should re-roll as a warrior if they want to tank.
---
This is because Paladin tanks are garbage in raids and paladin healers are great.
---
&gt;My secondary question is to understand why there is a hate campaign against paladins in vanilla? 
---
There is no hate campaign.
---
&gt;I know they are flawed in some regards as with all hybrid classes but I personally think that compitition for loot/role, coupled with the popularity of the Warrior class is the driving force behind this negativity.
---
Nah, the toolkit, or lack therof is the driving force behind people saying Paladins aren't great tanks.
---
Mal’ganis had some great players
---
Is that right? Please provide me with more sagely wisdom, preferably on the topic I posted about
---
\*licks lips in undead\*
---
Yes it is
---
Everytime someone says Shockadin isn't a real thing until TBC I have to show this video.
---
I remember many of T2 sporting Paladins running around in Holy doing plenty of damage while healing their teammates in between their burst unloads.
---
https://youtu.be/ay7RU0N-44Y
---
Flurry is a very niche buff that is not viable early game(AS scales with gear and w-buffs). Even when its viable its only viable on alliance(WF totem resets your swing timer so getting AS bonuses has diminishing returns).
---
Apart from even generating the threat is that they basically CAN’T tank swap, they have no taunt.
---
I didn't reply to you
---
Wow had like 200k players at launch, and the queue times were absolutely insane, the servers couldn't handle the business at all, and they had to add an extra 40 servers because it was growing so fast. [source](http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/world-of-warcraft-shatters-sales-record)
---
How many players are going to play classic at launch? I think that number could easily be over a million, especially as many currently active subscribers are going to give it a shot for sure. 
---
So they'll either have to add an enormous amount of servers which will get pretty empty as the hype dies forcing them to then merge server, or they accept that the starting zones will be way too overcrowded &amp; unplayable and queues will be hours or even days long and hope that players will come back after some weeks, or they implement layering....
---
Well you better brace yourself
---
Paladins strength as tanks is theye are better att tanking large groups of mobs then possibly any one. When I'm saying large i mean large like 6-7+. There glaring weakness is not what everyone will tell you the lack of taunt it is that they are mana based and int/mana takes item points from mitigation. The second problem (still more important than taunt) is that the whole talent tree as prot revolves around getting critted. Now that /sit does not work there are no way of controlling when you get critted. Thirdly there are almost no gear for a prot paladin after dungeon blues. In conclusion they can tank 5 man it takes longer then a warrior or druid and your group will have to work whit you and be aware of you're strengths/weakness. In raides you can tank trash especially if you aoe them that's it.
---
Sleeper as in hidden op
---
Stealth adds another dimension to the game that non-stealth classes can never enjoy.
---
You sound like a nightmare to be around. Good luck.
---
Rape as many streamers as possible and be cancer
---
Yeah... you're not gonna run around using R1 heal to try and heal your tank.... you use multiple ranks including the maximum rank
---
I would actually like to see that. A guild hall would be fantastic.
---
Good post.  No guild is just 40 members either.  Usually there's like 50-60, so that adds a good deal of time as well.
---
See, this is the issue. There are a few things I agree with and others that make me shudder. I’m not sure how they would please everybody without just leaving it the same. We wanted vanilla wow and they’re giving us vanilla wow. Well written and put by the way, I appreciate the enthusiasm and love for the game. I guess, if they did anything I would only hope that they ran the whole player vote system. Time will tell and I’ll see you in classic my friend.
---
Rogue. Only class that can spend his evenings chilling in the city of the opposing faction.
---
"Healer I have for you potions for mana bar healz! now GO GO GO I keep you safe! LEEEROYYY!"
---
Pretty sure they all conjured stuff did
---
"They keep dumbing down the game, the old talent tree was much more complex and interesting".... Proceed to copy and paste a guide found on the internet.
---
Thanks for the advice. I've been looking for a proper explanation for a while
---
It could, but Blizzard will not do it. 
---
1) Because it will be difficult for them to facilitate correctly without basically doing what they did in later expansions.
---
2) They don't want to poke that bear.
---
Only discovered him recently, but as an old Vanilla MT I really like him, he knows his stuff.
---
Paladins are superior to Shamans but the Shamans are superior at making other classes better.. I think?
---
Had to shave mine for a new job, should be fired by the end of August
---
&gt; Rerolled a Druid at 60 and had a blast.
---
How was your raid experience as druid, lot of healing or did you get to do fun moonkin/fite-cat stuff?
---
The way the reservation announcement was worded leads me to believe server list will be available then. Possible they could have more added at launch would just depend on turn out.
---
Awesome! Where did you get this OP?
---
Enhance are beasts in TBC
---
Im a undaed rouge
---
Bullshit. My first character was 21 days played to hit level 60 but that was because I was 15, just messed around with friends and the guild, and had absolutely no idea what I was doing.
---
If you've done it before, and you're not playing warrior or paladin, you can hit lvl 60 in 11-12 days played without stressing about it.
---
Your reading comprehension skills are severely lacking.  I’m all for layer, as I’ve said in every comment I’ve made in this thread.  What exactly am I supposed to be whining about exactly?
---
Boo
---
I wouldn’t really say that’s even remotely close to a viable test for fury tanking. It’s way too hectic and uncontrolled situation. Not at all like a raid fight.
---
[From here buddy](https://www.reddit.com/user/IllustriousPositive8/comments/c1fv79/stormwind_university/)
---
Same, I'm excited to play with my friends again but they all want to roll Horde. I hate the Horde models and also they cities. Stormwind and Ironforge shit all over all the Horde cities imo.
---
Well it will be there for 3 months so.
---
they were made better
---
And all this time you just had to google it instead of being snarky on reddit
---
Stack a shitload of Agility and crit chance gear and you can reach close to 20% crit chance with blues at 60.
---
You'll feel like Unbreakable but on a smaller scale of course.
---
Enhancement Shaman is an incredibly dynamic class since 80% of the time you're really quite average and then 20% of the time you're quite effective and maybe 3% of the time (lucky triple WF crit + Stormstrike + Earth Shock) you're a God.
---
World Buffs provide another avenue of options for players. Removing them from sections of content will promote further gatekeeping of content to a minimal number of spec's as it will make things further unviable. when a group's total values are considered.
---
If a healer is drinking for mana and you are at 50% hp, and the first thing he has to do is top you off, why not eat again?
---
I upvoted you btw.
---
The best place to start is to figure out what your most mana efficient heal is. For Druids its Rank 4 Healing Touch. If R4 Healing Touch can do the job, you want to use it. 
---
Once you know what your mana efficient heal is, you can expand on that for different situations. Bigger max rank heals for emergencies, probably popping Nature's Swiftness.  Really though the foundation is knowing what is mana efficient and just reading the situation as it arises later.
---
For other things, you'd want to use a Rank 1 spell just to get the effect. Frostbolt is Frostbolt no matter the rank, if all you want is the slow its better to use R1.
---
Why would blizzard ever release a shit product?

Hahahahahahahhaha. Are we all in 2019 here?

---
Selling well =/= good. 
---
BFA was the fastest selling expansion of all time, so clearly its better than Vanilla/BC right?
---
Your healing and damage spells will resive plus healin/spellpower based on base casting speed in classic no matter the rank. this was changed in I think wotlk to make healing more streamlined.
---
And all the remaining players have abused the shit out of it and the economy is ruined. gg
---
I'm playing as a frost mage on a private server right now. Level 37.got about 80 spell power now. And I use less wizard oil for a bit extra. I have noticed if you play on pvp it is a detriment to go all in on spell power as you are a squishy target in the wild.  Maybe this will change at 40 with ice barrier

In 1.12 it worked that way. Check the patch notes posted above.
---
They basically had all skills and abilities learned working that way by 1.12. Sure did suck to switch specs before that.
---
This is the new meta for dps on a pally:  https://classicwow.live/guides/314/spelladin-raid-dps-pre-bis-phase-1-new-meta
---
From my first guild where myself and my roommate acted as the two Tanks I have to disagree so strongly, I hated every other warrior that was present in that guild for the 6th months It was a guild.
---
The guild had something like 8 warriors counting myself and my roommate and everyone of them had the thought that they were clearly the best tank ever even though they didn't know the importance of simple things like +Def gear or +Hit % to name simple things.
---
Myself and my Roommate were selected as the go to tanks though after a few weeks of raiding in MC/Ony/ZG  as being the best choices out of everyone they had. 
---
The other 6 warriors after that decision was made wanted nothing to do with us and the feeling became mutual and we basically didn't interact outside of Raids.
---
Eventually the guild we were in moved into BWL and by this point the anamosity between the tank and non tank warriors reached a boiling point and a decision was made that Myself and my Roommate were start rotating roles with the other warriors that wanted to tank.
---
So the next MC run the guild did they spent the 4 hours the guild normally took to kill everything up to Rag instead wiping on the trash to Magmadar for most of it and eventually getting stuck at Garr for the remainder.
---
Myself and my Roommate did the most intelligent thing ever following the end of the raid where we weren't even allowed to take over to speed things up was talk to a couple of other guilds and the following week we both had a new home and the guild we left after another month of trying never even reached Rag again, the tanks they had left being to incompetent to efficently clear MC.
---
Damn I just now remembered having to collect arrows back in the day. Shit was lame but seems more realistic compared to now
---
Gonna be playing Mage for the first time at launch (Was a pally main in vanilla) and this and your comments are really helpful. Thank you!
---
It really does. I've been doing 1-30 runs on various classes. Even as a Druid, stealth is just brokenly fun. There were dozens of times I should have just been killed by gangs of horde, but I was stealthed just outside of their perception range.
---
My personal favorite thing to do isn't to gank, but to just follow a lower level player in a contested zone that doesn't favor their faction. Like Stonetalon; heavily favored Horde zone. I'd just follow an alliance player around, wait for him to get ganked during a pull, and just murder the dude trying to 2v1 him.
---
I was really good at controlling AotP and not getting anyone dazed. I still got yelled at for ever having it on.
---
So better than roll the dice vanilla, but just not the best melee dps then?
---
&gt; being in a guild without fear ward.
---
I want a non dwarf alliance priest, is this going to be a problem for raiding at all?
---
It's your choice to join a guild that is pressuring you to get world buffs.
---
Can you elaborate? How can you push 1k dps as ret in later tiers
---
I hated when they implemented X realms BGs in 1.12
---
Does that mean no rezzes at all? I’d gquit so fast lol.
---
Oh good. Sounds like as long as I keep it simple like I use to do that I should fly under the radar.
---
I would use a tool to send certain keys to all running instances. So when I pressed 1, all 5 or whatever instances would press 1. No additional actions or out of game logic script were ran.
---
All the other macros I needed were managed in game. Things like follow character or set target to character's focus.
---
You can't fury tank test anyways.
---
The itemization is so stupid they don't even give warriors 2 1handers. Just 1. And a shield. And 2 different 2handers.
---
And it's not just warriors who suffer from bad gear. Almost every class does. Hybrids suffer the worst. Pallies and druids? Laughably bad.
---
Drowning Pool - Bodies
---
Or GTFO
---
Except they could.  I specifically remember one such case in Naxx where a Dwarf Hunter was bragging about his dps (which appeared remarkable) and basically telling the rest of us to L2P.  Folks probed him on what he was doing and he was silent.  Then someone posted a pic of him in IF with his pet... named the same as him.  I don't remember all the popular meters used back then but at least one that was common enough still had this issue in Naxx.
---
Hard to say who is the best, maybe, maybe not
---
What comes around goes around too. The other week on an undocumented server, I ran into a paladin in Westfall who pulled the Dust Devil. I poped a grenade and a few heals on him to bail him out of death, he thanked me. Later on, I had overpulled murlocks and was gonna die, but I see the same dude come over the ridge, he saves me in turn, and we group up for the next 30 minutes killing murlocks. It was great.
---
That warlock will remember you, you have an ally in the world.
---
I was such a noob then, and still now.....I can't remember that Meteor Trinket.
---
I can't tell from that video if shadowform is the reason he hasa GCD or if he dispelled twice, or even something else.
---
I'm not sure that you could even mechanically put a GCD on something that is essentially removing a buff, because what's to stop you removing shadowform via right click when you already have a GCD active?
---
This said though if you're right it's definitely worth discussing. I would need something a little clearer than that particular video though.
---
I haven't shaved in nearly 2 years.
---
Don't be so sensitive. The post was meant to incite discussion and it has for the most part.
---
I honestly don't remember.  It was 'good enough' is about all I can give.  It certainly wasn't a top of the line machine (a hand-me-down from a friend, actually) but it certainly wasn't a relic, either.
---
Could be both.
---
Yeah. I remember doing it during wrath, but I certainly haven't figured it out for vanilla clients.
---
I really doubt that it triggers  GDC as leaving druid forms also doesnt. Im pretty sure he does a renew right after shadow gorm which is what is trigerring the gdc
---
Well, I wouldn't say without procs that Enh is average. It's borderline awful damage without a proc.
---
Seems a little strange if it was different to the druid form/mount/stealth cancel aura macros that don't trigger GCD but i'll take your word for it.
---
Okay, so the loosely mention that new content can be "considered", not really conclusive, is it? The only conclusive thing about this, is like I said, any changes whatsoever wont be considered before Classic is to an end. So now that this is out of the way, lets go back to what this whole thread is about, which is restricting/removing world buffs, and let me ask you again; why are you mixing these things up? If you watched the video I linked in my previous comment, you should now know about the design philosophy for Classic. So let me ask you, why do you think Blizzard would go out of their way and not follow that design philosophy?
---

---
&gt;Even if you did get an extra 30% damage per Frostbolt, this saves you exactly 1 Frostbolt eg. where it took me 4 to kill a mob, now it takes you three. HeyGreat! However, if I stacked INT, I could cast say 3 Frostbolts more, which makes us equal!
---
Even if we were equal under the scenario the spell power mage did more DPS. However since a lvl 40 mage with the spell power gear listed will be able to cast over 20+ frostbolts you end up needing 7 or 8 additional frostbolts to do the same amount of damage. That's over 1000 mana (72 INT) using the lvl 38 frostbolt.
---
&gt;It is vastly more complicated than saying "spell power does more damage therefore it must be better". It is in fact, wrong. Until you actually save one frost bolt per mob, spell power does not do anything for you.
---
Which is very easy to do since with the gear listed you do 30-40% more damage. 
---
Lets take a [Wastewander Thief](https://classicdb.ch/?npc=5616) for instance. The lvl 40 version has 1919 health. A rank 7 frostbolt with 0 +spell damage does 227 minimum damage and with the spellpower gear listed the minimum damage is 324. The +0 damage mage needs a maximum (without resists or crits) of 8.45 frostbolts to kill the target. A mage with the damage gear listed needs a maximum of 5.92 frostbolts to do 1919 damage. Since we can't do .45 or .92 frostbolts the +0 mage must use 9 frostbolts to kill the Wastewander and the Spell Power mage only needs 6. Three frostbolts is equivalent to 400 mana per mob. Since frostbolt's damage spread is very low (around 20) the difference between the maximum and minimum number of frostbolts almost solely relies on criticals. If you did the maximum damage per bolt without crits (248) you would still need 8.
---
I don't see any technical reason stopping me. I was more curious if Blizzard ever started cracking down on the practice. 
---
I know they go after botting and out of game multi-action automation (like auto crafting). But back in tbc anyway, it felt like they didn't have an issue with basic multi-boxing.
---
Same, I was in a progression raiding guild from launch through BC.  Was there some drama, sure, but it wasn't that bad. Some of the bigger drama was when the first person got a great upgrade, then said "Got to catch a boat to Fiji." /gquit followed by dropping from vent and the dude never logged back in.  
---
We legit had someone do this, so it became a running joke.  Was fun to do, especially on alt runs when everyone was goofing off...
---
I will say with loot council, the only significant drama came off of alt runs where we were also gearing up new recruits.  Longstanging guildies losing out (on alts) to new recruits, many of which were terrible players but we were hoping to teach.
---
I was hoping not to have to give a complicated answer. The OPs question was very broad so I gave a blanket answer.
---
Yes, there are stellar items in raids for PvPers, but what is best in socket for an arms warrior is not what's best in socket for a fury or prot warrior. So while there's awesome stuff in Naxx for an arms warrior, alot of the stuff the fury warrior is wearing is borderline useless for you in PvP. You don't need weapon skill and hit chance which are extremely important for fury, you need strength (AP is acceptable), crit chance, and buckets of survivability.
---
The best in socket fury items will be sacrificing survivability and giving you stats you don't need 
---
You can apply this concept across the board, but not the specifics. While best in socket mage raiding gear will be great for PvP, he's still going to die quickly. 
---
There is stuff in raids that is best in socket for PvP but it's itemized differently than the best in socket stuff for PvE.
---
Why cant we just invalidate runs that include world buffs? if youre going for speed clears you wont have trouble "clearing" without the buffs to begin .  
---
I'm sure there will be some website to track the fastest runs.
---
Mangle doesn’t even exist in Classic.  You can DPS as a cat in raids, but it’s about 100x more work and effort (MCP farming for countless hours each week) to still end up doing substantially less DPS than true DPS specs.  
---
The advantage is the snowflake status, as very few people are willing to put the effort in to make the spec work at a viable level.
---
Feral off tanking is another way to go.  MCP are still nice when going for max threat, but not a necessity to perform the role properly like DPS is.
---
Does it apply shadowform to your mount? That’s what I want to know.
---
First goal is to hit 60. 
---
Second goal is epic mount. 
---
Third goal is leveling craft professions. 
---
Maybe throw some fairly casual pvp and raiding in there too.
---
You get claw when you get car form though, no?
---
More godly than other expansions. Warriors were unfair balls of destruction limited only by health pool and cc
---
Yeah, you could have enough servers, and then when 80% of them are empty in a month or two you're fucked.
---
It does, or is supposed to. I'm sorry but idk why people comment if they don't know for sure. Just spreads rumors.
---
If your the first to die, particularly as a Frost Mage.. your definitely doing it wrong.
---
Agree with you
---
I got a tall order of things some harder than others. The best part is knowing how good each thing will feel to strike off the list. Such a satisfying feeling.
---
That's how it is on private servers so wouldn't be surprised if its true. Its horrible but gotta keep it the same.
---
&gt; I'm surprised you're getting upvotes for spreading misinformation.
---
you must be new here (on reddit)
---
There isn't while leveling. You use max rank
---
Blackrock Mountain quest right?
---
SPIRIT BOND LMAO
---
Oh I thought you were talking about debuff slots.
---
If I recall correctly, a long time ago (somewhere between BC and cata) they said they didn't care about multiboxingsince an actual person is paying for and playing all of the accounts
---
sort of sounds like the existance of aggro meters - wasn't it only used by like one guild until the original got leaked or something.
---
Shouldn't we just ban all addon's because there exploit's ? giving players unfair advantage over players that aren't using addon's or not the same ones etc.
---
What flatlands in WoW?
---
Nah I just expected more people to know what's up. \^\^
---
And not over commit. I wanna enjoy myself leveling and find a good balance end game. I am probably gonna do mostly pvp and occasional pugs for zg/aq. I can’t do 40 man raids. That shit takes too long for my current phase in life.
---
* Raider A shows up with consumeables and tactics, performs well
---
* Raider B shows up with consumeables and tactics, but also spent hours getting wbuffs prior to the raid, performs better than Raider A
---
On pservers, it's expected that you show up with wbuffs in hardcore guilds because they're much easier to get. Raider A is slacking and will obviously not be first in line for the juicy loot. In the top guilds, it's likely that Raider A will get benched for someone that grabs wbuffs.
---
In Classic, wbuffs will be much harder to get. On one hand, you can't really say Raider A is slacking. On the other, Raider B is investing more effort in their raiding performance. Why should Raider A and Raider B be viewed as equally performing when they're not? Raider B should have the edge in loot priority when compared to Raider A.
---
Apparently a guild that gives more loot to the people that put in more effort is considered "a supremely tyrannical organization". Guess all the EPGP guilds will disband.
---
Bad priest. You should always buff your group mates in dungeons.
---
These buffs are not mandatory... If you don't like them, just don't use them. I like the idea you can do something extra to do better than the others.
---
What you’re seeing is 2019 gaming manifest. It’s easy to jump in and play the fool when you’re given a character you haven’t earned, can’t meaningfully develop, and are funnelled into a specific activity. Don’t see this as what to expect in classic :)
---
Shimmering flats.
---
It’s a joke
---
Nope, you were right. I just crossed this post with another one I made. My bad.
---
Oh my god, all of you are correct. It doesn’t need to be based on only one place.
---
One other positive is that you can tag mobs with arcane shot or serpent sting while in cheetah and let your pet kill them.  You can’t do that on a mount.
---
Not gonna get ganked there, that’s for sure.
---
Amusing that he wants to argue with me about what worked for me (and plenty of other raid groups) for over 7 years straight with a very large group of people who *aren't* top raiders, so its not like I'm Kungen, demanding only the best of the best even bother applying, and I have a neverending stream of applicants who will no life even harder than the person they're replacing if I told them they needed to, yet he's the one deleting all of his posts.
---
Thanks for tips, never played a warrior so need to learn all these nuances.  Never played melee actually.
---
The questing comes from Pservers.  They are jam packed right now.  Fighting for quest mobs gets old and there are plenty of people WAITING to kill those elites on quest line ends.
---
You *technically* don’t need fear ward. Horde have done nef, afterall. However most raids would like at least two dwarf priests to rotate fear wards in raids. If they have two of them then you’re probably fine... being dwarf priest and knowing how to play makes a spot very easy to get though.
---
I wouldn’t mind heroics or Mythic+ but even still want it on separate servers. Just like I think TBC if they go that route shouldn’t be forced.
---
Classic should remain classic and once you add it’s not longer classic.
---
The gfs also have nrckbeards.
---
Are the private servers out of touch?
---
No, it’s Blizzard who is wrong.
---
I miss it so much, hope to see you in August!
---
Yup.
---
Honestly mate, this sibreddit is 90% salt and toxicity
---
&gt;I don't see why his dps dictates his leveling speed.
---
I lol'd
---
I mean I'm as hyped for Classic as the next guy, but I'd still play retail arena if the balance was utter dogshit.
---
That being said, slugfests that are all about mana management on the healers parts is so fucking stupid as a DPS, because it literally doesn't encourage skillful play at all; You just PvE DPS and hope their healer OOMs first.  Congrats, super skillful.
---
Being forced to chain CC from 2+ classes/DR types to land a kill is infinitely more entertaining from both a player and a viewers standpoint, as well as being more exciting for the DPS and healer, and not just one or the other.
---
Yeah, i don't know what it is about this specific weekend. Kronus is a zoo. I was leveling a warrior last night to finish [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c1fzot/a_profession_guide_for_leveling_warriors/), and I saw no less than 4 different hordies trying to pvp.... in elwynn forest. And not like level 60's. There was a level 10 shaman running around in goldshire and fargodeep mine.
---
You are fucking deluded.
---
Sometimes that is enough to prevent a wipe, I respect a priest that can kite in a dungeon and keep aggro/stay alive long enough for that lone remaining dps to kill the last mob or two.
---
Hunter and priest
---
probably not, many raiding guilds will use 5-9 ish priests, only 1 or maybe 2 of those being dwarves will be helpful and they certainly won't be necessary, extra fear wards are just going to go on dps. Human spirit are probably better to stack the raid with, and shadowmeld is useful in a lot of situations outside of raiding specifically. (world afk safety and pvp defense most specifically)
---
&gt; If they are 100% and jumping up and down
---
That gave me an idea.  
---
   
---
"After each pull jump up and down without stopping to let me know you're ready for next one, I'll go when everyone's doing it."    
---
Then you only need to check if one of them is standing still.
---
I feel like the bag space conditions on Classic beta alone make an argument for just ignoring professions altogether with most classes. 
---
Probably the time you save not picking herbs (which as you noted probably would be scarcer) would make up for any power loss from not having potions or money you could have earned in that time. 
---
I plan to go Priest and take Tailor/Enchanting, just because it synergizes nicely with the resource being insta-lootable from mobs, that resource not being needed surely for FA with a healer, a BiS at the end of the road from tailoring and then enchanting for its natural synergy with tailoring and ability to compress multiple greens into 1-2 slots (not to mention access to some levelling wands in case they end up being scarce or expensive). 
---
I plan to drop them both post Truefaith for herb/alchemy and then ride around with a mount post zerg levelling herbalism. 
---
TLDR; it’s probably more efficient just to level to 60 as fast as possible and not worth the time looting herbs or varying from the mad beeline required to pull ahead of the Zerg.
---
All of them most likely
---
&gt;  But we can still create and maintain communities in retail
---
It's not impossible. It just doesn't seem to happen at all
---
100% agree. I have multiple max lvl toons in retail, but I’ve never been able to stomach a priest past 30.
---
Looks like I struck a nerve
---
Hopefully they delete anyone using world buffs from the top rankings.
---
I disable all subreddit CSS; avoids this particular problem, and also just presents every subreddit a consistent, readable format.
---
* preferences -&gt; display options -&gt; allow subreddits to show me custom themes
---
wasn't there mechanic originally gonna be something called focus though ?
---
Council is the fairest and most optimal way for a good guild to gear. Get used to it. DKP has all sorts of massive issues and shouldnt be used by any guild worth their salt. Rolling is straight up fucking troll.
---
I never played vanilla so I'm going to do everything I missed! Some of the mount and item grinds, AQ20/40, and I'm rolling a Priest which is the only class I haven't played. Level as shadow and switch to Disc healing for endgame + BGs.
---
No problem
---
I hate pandas, but I actually enjoyed MoP more than BFA, Cata, WoD.
---
I'm not good at explaining it
---
Thats my point.  CC *should* matter.  It doesn't most of the time currently in BfA, otherwise you wouldn't see shit like walking dead or TSG getting anywhere because they'd get shut right the fuck down by RMX or caster MLD or something with heavy CC.
---
I hate toxic slugfest metas where CC chains are an afterthought.  A single 5 second stun, or an intimidating shout onto a single player (such as the healer) while you zerg someone down in 3 seconds isn't CC.  Having to chain a stun into a fear into something else, fine, that takes at least an ounce of coordination to do properly and not heavily overlap and look like fools.
---
Hilarious that people are downvoting me for saying shitty melee cleaves in retail are bad, in a Classic WoW fucking sub.
---
You received a perfectly good answer several times. No taunt. Slow due to mana instead of rage. Not sure how to make it more simple than that.
---
It really depends on the dynamic. I'm raiding on an undocumented server and I fucking loathe the other players in my class here. I think they're dogshit players and are on the class they're on because they cant reasonably be expected to press more than 1 button in combat.
---
You'll likely be spamming shadowbolt as your main source of dps anyway.
---
Well you can still get the non tier items. Hell for more people the tier sets aren't particular good compared to other items that drop in the raids 
---
It's not until tier three that they really outperform other drops in the raid for their intended specs
---
How did you manage your abilities with only 12 action buttons?
---
Night Elf Mohawk....
---
Vanilla was designed to run on toasters. 
---
You should be OK with what you have.
---
The mount issue shouldn't be a problem if you have a good friend leveling with you. He gets free mount, and he could lend you money for your mount :)
---
Yeah, and anyone using warrior dps. Or mana pots. Just makes the game too easy.
---
What exploit? You mean in AV server?
---
The mind control would break I imagine
---
I just had a memory come back of doing this!  Thanks 😊
---
For some reason I can tolerate a spell cooldown, but energy bars are annoying. I think maybe it's seeing the bar slowly creep up, and everything depends on that bar. It's like a global cooldown, which too much of is also annoying.
---
But unlike a spell cooldown, the initial burst using energy isn't the same timing as when the energy runs out. So to me it's hard to get used to the timing. It feels fast at first, then dreadfully slow.
---
Definitely was.  I remember grinding cultists in Blasted Lands and testing this.  I think it was only for weapons, though.
---
If they had a weapon in their loot other than what the base model normally had, they always dropped that weapon.
---
You're the one pretending that...
---
Closest thing to class specific content you'll ever see in this game is in Legion doing your Order Hall quests. 
---
Those are very indepth and lore rich.
---
I don't think that tool would be acceptable :(
---
Eh not really. You cover good distance with blink and have plenty of escape tools. Skilled ganksters can stay in plain sight and still get away, and probably killing a few idiots that dared chase you where they have no backup. Also half the people standing around at any given time are afk or pve carebears who break into a cold sweat at the thought of being flagged.
---
Yes, that's my point. 3 months is a lot longer than a week or two of waiting.
---
Several perfectly good answers are what I'm looking for. I have no way to validate anyone's opinions so the more consistent the responses, the more likely it's true. Try not to get offended by class dicussions in future. It's not worth it.
---
I feel like a lot of what you are saying is correct. the best way to level to 60, especially on a pvp server, is to ignore all professions, play 22 hours a day, and have a leveling buddy who also does the same, and just bang off group quests like the whirlwind axe with a 5 man group of level 32's. or maybe just don't get the whirlwind axe. I hear skarm (of skarmtank) is rolling a druid to tank early raids.
---
But that's just never going to be me. I am not likely to play more than 60 hours during the entire launch week. that means that there is no way in hell I will be server first, or near server first. I am rolling a warrior. I still haven't decided on pve vs pvp server.
---
I feel that given all that, It's very realistic to buy at the very least, 6 slot bags, and for 8 and 10 slots... those are crafted anyways. I have no idea what the economy is going to be like, so I don't want to speculate on the cost.
---
But with my alchemist: I easily got, before leaving ironforge on my way to darkshore, 150 skill on all 4 of my professions (I don't take fishing until darkshore), which was 20 silver.
---
You can buy 4 6 slot bags from vendors for that price. And my build is VERY ruthless on bag space. In fact, I am vendoring a lot of cloth in my starting build to buy the heater shield, so I don't even have a lot of bag space for extra bandages.
---
There will be 10 layers per Server for release.  
---
3 million accounts.   2x10^6 accounts / 3000 accounts per layer /10 layers per server = 67 Servers
---
Time to swap friends, you are now fuzz
---
Thanks for the information and the link
---
That's a nice strawman you have there.
---
Yes because none of that shit is what made Classic what it was.
---
Shades spawning everywhere, at least 6 raid groups in one zone, less than one frame per second. Still loved every second of it!
---
&gt; If a DPS waits 3 months to see an item drop, but some other guy who attended less raids (but is better DPS) gets that item, then you better believe that the more dedicated player is going to jump ship more often than not. 
---
In that scenario the guy with better attendance gets the item, no question.  I don't care if the flaky guy does better DPS, he isn't reliable.  I only care about top, *reliable* players.
---
If player A has 100% attendance and always does 100 damage per fight while player B has 50% attendance and always does 110 damage, in a 10 boss raid, player A will do a cumulative 1000 boss damage across the raid, player B will do 1100.  Over the course of the content cycle (call it 6 months), player A will do 24000 cumulative damage in our raids, player B will only do 13200 cumulative damage.  Who benefits my raid group more?
---
My personal primary concern is attendance first.  Attendance followed by performance, unless your performance is so abysmal that the flaky guy who isn't even there is somehow less detrimental than your presence, in which case, you likely won't be around long, probably after being heckled by fellow raiders who are pulling their weight, or you shape up and pull your weight real quick.
---
will there be an addon?
---
I mean... kicks don't last for 10 seconds lol
---
"jump up and down when ready for next pull and don't stop."     
---
If my healer isn't jumping, I'm not pulling.
---
My gf's macbook can run it so I don't think an iMac will have any troubles.
---
oh you agree with me? :D lol
---
heated topic
---
I had to slow the video to 0.25 speed to figure out what is going on here.  
---
At 23:51 it does look like he pressed his Shadowform keybind but he also [uses a Combat Mana Potion by clicking it](https://i.imgtc.ws/NTPy9GF.png).
---
It was probably just a basic spell on his actionbar and not a macro (I'll take your word for it that /cancelaura didn't exist back then), and thus it acts as a toggle which consumes a GCD when both turning on and off.  
---
Do we know for a fact that right-click dispelling would have triggered the GCD?  
---
Perhaps this was a calculated handicap, he knew that pressing the keybind would trigger the GCD but he needed his mouse to click a potion.
---
How the hell can they know how much is enough servers?
---
I rather have layering instead of a guess on how many servers they should add. 
---
Wouldn't be fun to play on a dead server.
---
&gt;Do I literally just afk for 10 seconds? Is there anything useful I can do while locked out of holy?  
---
Pretty much. You can throw a nade, bandage, get to a better position - autoattack someone if you really want to, but essentially yeah a holy locked holy paladin is essentially a big player controlled critter.
---
You have plenty of ways to be honest. If you typed "why are paladin tanks bad in classic" into Google you could literally shower in the results, maybe then this thread wouldn't smell like shit
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=2139/counterspell](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=2139/counterspell)
---
You should. The expansions following Wrath typically only got better with time. 
---
Quests are not totally mindlessly and they add new and fun things with each expansion + new ways to tell stories through things like phasing. 
---
If you're really looking to kill time, Legion content is really the most lore rich for classes that the game has produced yet. You can really sink your teeth into a particular class with that expansion.
---
I think, in Classic, Ratchet has no AH. Everlook, Booty Bay and Gadgetzan are connected
---
Shadow priest / warlock gets my vote
---
Not an ability or talent but atill relevant i guess:
---
I always thought that the parrot cages (like https://classicdb.ch/?item=8492) displayed some continents of the world, which was a strange choice for a pet icon. It was only after 10+ years when revisiting vanilla WoW on private servers that I realised how it displayed a parrot's head and beak.
---
Pretty sure holy shock is fire damage? You could also get engineering so you have multiple gadgets to use during that down time.
---
Yeah, this is very accurate.
---
Offspecs only really got their best weapons after the rest of the raid got them, unless they were such a stellar guildie that people helped them.
---
Ive seen guilds where the warriors would collude to prevent anyone else from getting ashkandi before they all got it - they would ask to give DKP to their fellow warriors or outright buy it for them 
---
It really feels unfair to people when a melee shaman gets sulfuras before warriors because of just how dang hard it was to get at the time. You need to balance people being cheated vs what benefits individuals the most
---
It will run good.
---
&gt; started to rez the tank, jumped at the last second, did this 3 or 4 times
---
Slowly pulling a rez out my pocket and - oh, it's the middle finger. I'm sorry let's try that again, pulling out the rez...
---
I took healing gear from raids. As for melee plate I rolled equally with the warriors. The warriors in our guild were only using it for pvp like myself. They cried a little, but got over it. I had pretty much all of the warrior DPS plate that wasn't a class drop- Obsidian belt, the red shoulders and helm (forget their name), etc. I took a quick strike ring when MC was on farm that caused a little bit of controversy (didn't drop that often for us), but that's about it. For our guild though, only progression based loot was class restricted. If we didn't have a raid on farm, then I couldn't take the trinkets, rings, necks, cloaks, etc. Two-handers and DPS plate were always open to me though, as they were considered pvp drops.
---
PRIVATE SERVER POPULATION WITH NO CHANGES FROM THAT PRIVATE SERVER EXPERIENCE
---
Right, and all the other **kicks** are half that duration, or less, if you're talking about earth shock.
---
You can layer glitch the STV arena chest so you're all alone btw. Easy.
---
Yeah my plan is to play a few hours on launch sleep then wake up early when a lot will get off and grind out all day onward. I figure early mornings/through the day will be less busy than evenings.
---
Classic is one of the best rpgs ever made. Just from a solo play through perspective it is up there with witcher 3, ff 7, chrono trigger etc.
---
People who like rpgs will adore classic and considering how addictive it is...
---
I feel that too. Just because I'm playing a healer doesn't mean I want to be bored. Push my limits and keep it exciting! I'll admit it's a fine line between that and stupidity that's just a guaranteed wipe though. 
---
In all honestly I tend to just go with the flow.  If the group is going slow and methodical, I'm cool with that. I just try to help contribute DPS in that scenario since the healing is too easy and enjoy a chill run. If my tank is a madman and going balls to the wall, I'm with him 100%, but some things are just not possible. Good tanks will usually work up to a faster pace if it's overly safe, as well as slow down a little if people start dying consistently.
---
I really only get upset with people who don't make an effort to work together in dungeons.
---
Ideally we build it into a web tool.
---
Get my wolf mount as undead
---
I’m trying to decide what faction Demon Hunter I wanna be.
---
&gt;  a broken and illogical system
---
ROFL!
---
Why would they?
---
Engineering in Classic and in TBC was pretty much required if you wanted to PVP. 
---
It was so important because Engineering pretty much allowed some class / spec combinations to actually work. As in you would likely be a free HK without it. 
---
This caused problems because it feels bad that you ***have*** to have a particular prof. in order to just pvp for some class / spec combinations. 
---
It also felt bad because you'd have to devote at least one profession just to do a part of the game that other classes don't have to. 
---
Which prompted Blizzard to ban Engineering for things like Arena (late TBC/Wrath) and better balance (as much as it is) classes in pvp settings.
---
That's generally the case for everyone seeing as very few good items are limited to only one class. Casters compete with other casters, healers with most all the other healers, and melee with most the other melee. There really aren't that many items that don't have use among multiple classes outside of tier gear.
---
Thanks for the pro tip!
---
Agree. Mained a rogue first time round, they blow in 1.12. In every aspect a fury warrior is better.
---
You guys treat that baby green Jesus nicely now, ya hear!?
---
Dodge it.
---
MoP was good so much better than WoD and BFA combined.
---
Lmao it does the exact opposite
---
Hopefully people are even more community-minded this time around than the first time. I think they will be because that's what a lot of people are coming back for. No game really accomplished it like WoW did.
---
I have a 27” iMac and WoW runs fantastically. It runs even better on a windows boot camp partition on your iMac.
---
Orc mage is my favorite combo
---
No one is forcing you to comment. If you actually read the post you'd see that part of my reasoning for posting on reddit was due to the breadth of unsubstantiated opinions I'd found on forums.
---
Thanks for your advice to use Google though. Very insightful..
---
MT is the most demanding and important role. If you don't know anyone then the best bet to become MT is start a guild of your own. If that's too much work, then find a guild that still needs 2nd/3rd in line OT and either outperform the MT or be consistent and hope the MT quits the game or has to take a break. 2nd Tank is an awesome role because it's not as much pressure and you still get Tank Prio loot. A lot of bosses require tank swapping too so you have a chance to shine.
---
Cool input. You really convinced me. 
---
Lmao.
---
I wanted to Horde but wife says all the races too ugly
---
I was literally going to do this tomorrow. Thankyou for making my life easier!
---
TBC talents were great for hybrids.
---
Then you end up with servers that are extremely overpoulated or layering continues throughout the entirety of classic.
---
Pitbull does, not sure if it existed in Vanilla though.
---
I'm wondering if it's just because of the "crowd" older versions of games draws in. Old school Runescape (imo) has this same issue on their subreddit, but the main version of the game is a lot more tame in that regard. And other modern MMOs (at least GW2 and FFXIV) don't have this in any notable amount.
---
goal - to force the first 10 hordes I run into to take res sickness per day once I hit 60 and begin to grief the living shit out of lowbies for the lulz.
---
It’ll be pointless without beta numbers
---
Meh, I've always enjoyed it this way. Kind of see it as keeping business and pleasure separate. Try to keep it professional in my guild.
---
Names on servers are unique to the server, or at least they should be in classic.   So, I don't see how it would work without a server list.
---
Nah it's holy damage
---
Warlock is similarly casual PvE, and is arguably going to get more raid slots than hunters simply due to their scaling.
---
Well now you're Reddit SS of the day. :)
---
Used to have it on my 29 twink warrior in TBC as it was one of the only weapons that could have the moongoose enchant because of the missing level req and 35+ item level. I felt like a god.
---
Yeah, if the recruit is worth a damn, I have no problem telling a longer term raider to deal with it, its alt loot vs main, even if the main is new.
---
Alts are a fucking bonus, not a given.  Unless we're planning on you swapping mains because we need a role filled and are having problems for some reason recruiting and have someone willing to swap because say, we have an extra Warlock anyhow, and that Warlock already has a 60 Priest and wants to heal, then yeah, we'll gear them up as a main in an alt run, prioritizing over a new recruit.
---
I usually never did more than 1-2 alt runs in a given week, as I never had over 3 max level characters geared enough to actually do raid content until later in Wrath when I was doing dumb shit like hosting 5-6 GDKP runs per week to make stupid amounts of gold.  If other people want to run extra shit and organize and lead it, more power to them.
---
exploits don't count
---
You should probably read my comments again. I never said that I thought blizzard would change anything, before naxx. I just had to correct you on the "sole" purpose, because, whatever you may think it is, the first purpose is to make money anyways. If it's by changing the game further down the line, then that's what they'll do.
---
In normal circumstances you shouldn't get layered out of a fight based on what Blizzard have said about layering.
---
 I'd imagine theyve implemented something about staying on the same layer while having a spell on someone.
---
Though it's not clear if the implementation matches the intention yet.
---
Unless the healer for some reason has 0 mana for one big heal he tops the tank, drinks and then tank pulls
---
If healer has no mana at all then bloodrage bandage while he drinks and pull
---
The biggest problem with sitting down and eating is you lose your entire rage bar
---
sick vid
---
Wow is so optimized these days. You could run it with onboard laptop graphics and be fine with a low resolution
---
Should be more than fine with a Mac
---
I envy you.
---
While Apple computers aren’t made for gaming of any sort, wow has always seemed to run fine on them. If needed, throw it into low graphic settings and play the night away.
---
Nah i'm pretty sure its shadow damage :)
---
Spell power gear. Pallies do mostly spell damage, so it's dumb that everyone stacks AP which only affects like 25% of our damage.
---
Fast 1 handers and spell damage.
---
They aren’t exploits? They were never removed in vanilla like out of combat rezzing was or gy rushing. Hell even the infinite dots on ghuun didnt get removed in retail from logs. Theyre no different than flasking
---
Wouldn't think it'd be that much worse than having to re-buff every five goddamn minutes.
---
Hey whatever works man.  No judgement here.
---
My god we will have to endure these cancer YouTube thumbnail images for classic. Look what they done to my boy
---
Pve ret can do 1000dps in AQ and later
---
Tbc had world buffs
---
Stacking world buffs is an exploit.
---
Would have been funnier titled me and the boys finding an epic.
---
Which is almost useless in PvE.
---
I played wow starting in WOTLK up until a bit of MOP then quit. I mained rogue, but in classic I’m considering going Warlock because I want something new. Did warlocks have any sort of mobility back in vanilla? I want to do both PvP and PvE, never been too serious into one or the other. Plan on feeling out if I enjoy more PvP or pve in classic. So overall, how is warlock PvP / pve?
---
When warriors and rogues are indistinguishable.
---
lame video
---
Pally/Lock is better than Pally/War.
---
 Kargoz did all the testing, and Pally/War isn’t even top tier. 
---
The best Warrior combos are with Shaman and Priest, Shaman being better because of Bubble anti synergy and of course wind fury.
---
Can I just purchase vanilla wow and play classic or do I need the current version of the game?
---
Rogue. For some reason it’s the most boring class to me.
---
Yes, they are not spellcasters mana makes no sense.
---
I guess what I meant is they'll say, "well, we removed it before, the client already has it off, easier to leave it out than write new code". I don't imagine it's conspiracy as much as laziness and assuming it'll be better without. I just wanted to ask in the case someone could confirm from beta and bug report if necessary.
---
This is where math is important. The guys argument was that you'd waste mana if you don't get your +sp  just right. You don't cast a top level frost bolt as your last spell usually if you are trying to level efficiently.
---
Thanks -- yeah I do want to be able to play it on high. When I was younger I played it on an imac, and it ran, but I was always envious of my buddies gaming rid that ran it on high. Just wondering if classic will run on high on imac since obviously the tech is a lot better than it was 15 years ago
---
I looked back at my old guild's forums (still up after 13 years!) and they did regularly use world buffs when it came time to push encounters after learning it. A kind of one chance to push the fight. I did notice quite a lot of toxicity about it, ranging from people questioned whether a fight was even possible without World Buffs and people not pushing their fullest until they did the encounter with world buffs ("why should I use my pots now when our real chance to down the boss is with world buffs?"). It just seems like a huge win/win to remove world buffs to remove that toxicity AND make the encounter take longer to be downed (which people love to remind us on the forum that everything will be downed first week, why not try to extend it by removing cheese mechanics?)
---
90% of progress guilds will be like this, much like how in retail 90% of progress guilds require runes aswell as flasks etc.
---
How do you scatter and fd trap the nova deadzone if you’re already rooted from the nova? Wouldn’t you just be sitting there waiting for scatter to be done?
---
Awesome post. Love your thinking. 
---
Personally I don’t want anything tweeted or added. However, your ideas for some kind of WOW 2 or another new game with a vanilla design philosophy would be great.  👍 excellent discussion
---
Yeah, you're wanding, because 5sr.
---
It is insightful since before recommending it, I took the time to try it which you clearly haven't or you'd realise how unnecessary this thread is. You claim to have tried to do your research but I'm calling you on your bs
---
That's not at all what op is asking. They are asking about the max level to learn in order for that rank to be better than it would be compared to if they learned the next ranks, too.
---
Like a fire mage that only learns frostbolt 1 but that frostbolt does more dmg because it's your last rank.
---
Dont know if it works like that but if it does Im curious.
---
I played a fury warrior, the rotation/playstyle is great but I hated not having tier sets to shoot for.
---
The difference this go around is I’m not 11 years old and have limited free time. I’d LIKE to play classic 24/7, but I’ll have to settle for probably a 6-12 month timeframe to even get to 60. 
---
I think this will impact a lot of people as well.
---
Just go ele/resto and do as much dmg as a wf proc with your lightning bolt chain lightning combo bro
---
Yeah those tanks are the worst.  A guild I tanked for had an offtank that fun an socialable and was generally well liked by everyone outside of the other warriors who hated the guy.
---
The guy became unsufferable and the guild lost most of its warriors after the first Rag kill.
---
The guilds MT tanked Rag for 97% of the fight without a single knockback and right at the end when he was dead regardless of whether the tank was there or not our MT was knocked back for the first time and the prick tank no other warrior liked taunted and tanked the last 3% and the guild treated him as so superhero.
---
Suffice it to say a couple weeks later he was promoted to MT and shortly after that the guild collapsed cause every other warrior left cause they refused to put up with him.
---
Nope. It's not like later expansions where you can just skip raids easily. Sure maybe if you have a guild carry you, you could implant yourself with pre-raid BiS into say BWL/AQ20 perhaps.
---
Just what every raid needs... another dps warrior
---
Looks like a moonkin
---
Wow logs rarely removes stuff, so I doubt it will. 99 will be whoever has the highest dps, and world buffs will get ya there
---
I've been casually playing on a private server to scratch my gaming itch the past few weeks (outside of MTGA &amp; DotA). 
---
It's been a very pleasant way to kill an hour or two a few times a week. It's a very quiet experience compared to Vanilla, simply due to population, but I've made some friends, I have a few tanks and healers around my level that I prefer and we group up every so often while questing or for a dungeon run.
---
I got a 1yr sub in September, played BFA, grinded to M10, but I can't tell you a single person's name in the 6 months I was *very* actively grinding content multiple hours a day. 
---
The main reason classic wow felt good for me was the social aspect (and the challenge).
---
Best thing to do for these kinds of threads is just lie and let them realize the truth on their own. "Oh yea sure Prot Pallys are the *best* tanks in classic!" 
---
He gets the answer he wants and we all get to have a laugh at their expense. 
---
No point in explaining threat mechanics for the 10th time if its just going to fall on deaf ears.
---
Warlock has zero mobility. They have fear which is amazing in PvP.
---
You must get really confused if there is someone besides you hitting the ogre.
---
Yes and I would enable PTR as well. Just to be sure hah. Coincidentally I was invited the day after I updated my profile to include retail PTR.
---
based
---
I agree, but at the same time -- if it's better, I'd love to see someone break his record with a different build. 
---
Dude ~~was~~ is very thorough in his reasoning behind basically everything I've read in his guides (+ watching streams).
---
TBC - but this might be the updated SoR animation, rather than AW.
---
Clearly an lfg healer he’s behind the take and not sat whilst take pulls 
---
As someone that play both healer and tanks for real  healers stop following at the back you know the next pull get in position and sit as soon as the last mob dies you have s good 6-10secs till your tank needs healing combat doesn’t mean you have to stand up 
---
This excludes grievous and a couple of exceptions
---
TBC talents should have been in vanilla for all classes lol
---
He doesn't use any potion, because the potion isn't on cooldown afterwards.
---
&gt; at least one ret pally was very desirable in raids for a good portion of vanilla due to Blessing of Kings being down the tree.
---
Did they get to dps? :D     
---
*dream in ret pally*
---
They will avoid playing with you anyways, don't worry.
---
Whatever helps you sleep at night.. Your logic is hilarious BTW.
---
As shaman you will want to downrank your heals as your heals are super effective but are litteral mana hogs.
---
There is one, but I don't think anyone is allowed to name specific servers.
---
Also, it uses beta numbers which in some instances seems to be different.
---
Acquire the best gear in the game.
---
Kick gum and chew arse in PvP.
---
Maximize all profession slots.
---
Make a lot of money.
---
Heal people.
---
Help people.
---
And explore a little.
---
Remember this when we don't case Curse of Elements on the target.
---
Imp conc aura
---
I’m considering it!! I think I probably will.
---
If it's funny and relatable people will upvote it. Rather low effort actual funny relevant memes than fanart and cosplay. I'm just happy with any funny content that isn't another thread complaining about streamers.
---
If you don't find them funny you can just scroll past them. For being an adult I'm surprised you can't seem to accept that the overall majority here has a different sense of humour and you can choose to ignore the posts you don't like. Instead of making a thread complaining. :P
---
Why would maintank take priority on a 2hander
---
For a long time I thought warrior cleave icon was a fucking bird claw for some reason and for the life of me couldn’t figure out the reasoning for that.
---
Lionheart Helm will not be in from beginning?
---
My goals aren't very lofty but that's because I can easily get demoralized by goals too far out of reach. I also doubt I'll step foot in much 40 man raiding outside of MC pugs. 
---
P1 my goal is to clear each (Relevant) dungeon and max out my crafting profession of choice (Still torn between Blacksmithing or Alchemy).
---
P2 my goal is my Charger and a Skullflame Shield (IE: Farm lots of gold).
---
P3 my goal is is Exalted in AV for Unstoppable Force, as well as the Blue PvP set. 
---
P4 my goal is run ZG (My favorite Classic raid) and get the set from it. 
---
P5 my goal is to make a full set of T0.5. 
---
With nothing notably specific for P6. Probably just have some fun with the Scourge Invasion.
---
Nope-
---
Until 308, weapon skill is still the absolute vastly superior stat to literally anything else. Assuming you're combat you get a free 5, but covering that last 3 points is absolutely crucial. Dagger rogues will need aged core leather gloves OR a deaths sting for the whole expansion,  and if you aren't human it's impossible to cap weapon skill for maces because the weapon skill talent doesn't give mace skill. Even as human, you basically need anubisath warhammer  (aq40 trash) to get there.
---
Just because warriors get more out of it due to rage income scaling doesn't mean it's still not the highest point for point DPS increase for rogues.
---
I would imagine that it should run on high, at least at 30fps. If you care about frame rate though you may need to lower it. Some people are picky and want more than 60fps which I would think you’d need to set your imac to something closer to medium settings to run that higher frame rate but overall your computer will work well for wow classic especially where they aren’t updating most of the graphics.
---
I dunno he rocked Bill and Ted
---
Pallys can tank 5 mans. They just do it waaaaaaaay slower due to drinking and low threat gen. In raids they are useless
---
Wait until you find out about clear casting.
---
Level up Fishing and get the Polymorph:Turtle
---
The oddest thing are those that are wanting the oldest iterations of AV back. 
---
Quite possibly the most unfun thing to make it to vanilla.
---
I once had a guy say "I don't look at chat while speed leveling."
---
Never tought about the possibility to only learn 3 ranks of a spell ti have the rank 3 work at max since it is your highest rank. Are there any healing spells that you mostly use lower ranks anyways?
---
Thanks man. I didn't appreciate the issue of constant drinking slowing down dungeon progress so dramatically. Makes a lot of sense why other people wouldn't want to wait
---
I played a Troll Mage in Vanilla, but this time around I want to play a different class and I’ve settled on Warlock. I’ve seen a lot of mentions of how I’ll struggle if I play an Ally lock because of the high number of UDs with WOTFS. 
---
Is that true? If I’m primarily going to play PvP, am I better to go Horde to avoid Undead players? Also, of Orc/UD, who’s the better selection if that’s true?
---
Which is going to be so useful in all those 2v2 arenas we'll be doing in classic!
---
(Funny)
---
That’s why I love hunting horn in Monster Hunter World. I’m not doing as much damage as you all, but your doing s lot more because of me and surviving, and I get some monster head knock downs. 
---
Support classes can be a lot of fun when they are done right. Loving Dancer in FFXI was great, because you could really assist the healer and make the other DPS more potent.
---
&gt; Did/do warlocks ever summon a doomguard or infernal in a raid?
---
Not usually. Once summoned, the Doomguard and Infernal needed to be enslaved. These guys hit pretty hard as well, so you had to be quick. 
---
Enslave only lasts for a couple of minutes and can break randomly and without warning. This causes the demon to B line it to the warlock. 
---
They were not very useful in raids because of this.
---
Yeah its not a big deal when with friends and having fun, as a tank youre gunna be on the hook gearing guildies alts or even selling runs. On your 1000000th run of uld youre gunna wish you could do it in half the time
---
Thanks for the advice. The constant drinking sounds very annoying which would explain the negativity surrounding the class.
---
I hope whatever guild I eventually join has your understanding of min/maxing the guild's overall viability/strengths.
---
Lol at any rogue pvp build without 3/3 imp. gouge
---
Me too :)
---
Light be with you!
---
Blessing of Freedom does have some "hidden" bonuses that many people do not know about. 
---
Any debuff that slows your movement can be cleared (99% of the time). 
---
Yes, even debuffs that slow and also deal damage.
---
hi could you do me and probably a few others the favor of listing all the characters names you want for classic?  I just want to make sure i never have to play with someone as shitty as you.  K, thanks, bye.
---
Aerosmith
---
Is that a vanilla thing? Didn’t Athene do this to get world first 80 during wotlk
---
dam this is the best post yet
---
I get that. Efficiency seems to be the name of the game in classic. You've convinced me to roll warrior or just go dps
---
Didn’t athene do this in wotlk though to get world first 80?
---
That dagger was so good before the normalization patch
---
You have to time the scatter with the mages frostbolt cone combo. You also have 1-2 seconds of time on the Nova for the mage to get into position, then you scatter at the last possible second. Shortly after you are free from Nova and can fd trap. 
---
Scatter is 4 seconds, Nova is 8 (depending on rank used I believe)
---
1 to 2 for mage to get into position
---
Frostbolt is 2.5 seconds to cast, you scatter at 2.
---
4 seconds on scatter.
---
Target loss on the fd buys you a second or more.
---
Realistically 1.5+2+4+1.
---
Very few mages will get to your deadzone in 2 seconds, even fewer will cone of cold out of scatter. Even if they do, you broke up the shatter combo and the mage is now on the defensive. (Some may block, but that gives you time to get out.
---
You know, none of the horde inns in the entire game have chairs that you can right click to sit on? They all just stand around, sleeping on literal rocks, and tents or rock huts.
---
Oh wait, no there’s one. Brill’s inn has chairs, cause it’s a direct copy of the human inn.
---
What I want to know is if there is any advantage to not learning max rank  
---
\&gt;  " If you are using any other rank of a specific spell that isn't the highest rank **you currently know**, it will receive next to no bonuses from spell power "
---
So if you don't learn max rank, your highest rank of that spell will benefit from spellpower but if you do it won't according to the page I linked. I don't know if that's correct, but if it is it could mean that you might get really good heals per second from not learning higher ranks.   
---
Better mana efficiency and casting speed on lower ranked versions of spell if you stop there and don't get higher ranks?  
---
I just want to know how the math works out, and if there's a potential 'exploit' to be had here.
---
Maybe it's not rank 1 that's the sweet spot but 2 rank down from max? if this is a thing at all.
---
What /u/AG007 said, the pot isn't on CD after, plus you see his goal is to heal himself, but most importantly, he doesn't get any mana back.
---
I'm 99% sure it was like this in classic, and I've just confirmed in classic 1.12 client (local server I can run), plus this video, I think is sufficient evidence that warrants at least someone with Beta access to report it and let Blizzard identify it.
---
Druid.  Because of the outfits.
---
My wife is going to play and she keeps thinking I'm going to yell at her when she dies because she doesn't believe me that repeatedly being ganked is the best part of Vanilla WoW.
---
Paladins and Shamans were able to tank while leveling but were purposefully designed to *not* be endgame tanks.
---
Kevin Jordan has mentioned this several times on his stream. Ditto with Voidwalker. They were supposed to “tank” but not at endgame.
---
Sorry but no renew, his target frame is his own, and you can see he doesn't have the buff.
---
It’s the one I hoped for. Old AV sucked.
---
For me it's Hunter, never liked it in WoW.
---
But god damn is it sexy tho
---
I have been informed that it is only the equivalent of 1 gnomish death ray.
---
LoL another lfg kiddy, not going back to classic played it cleared it once I remember how the original Kara was
---
Caps at 1.5
---
ok v
---
Yea in BG's when a random guy asks for a buff i feel so compelled to say no :D
---
Blizzard claims that layering causes massive problems with world bosses though.  So does that mean we will have 3 sets of world bosses when the time comes?
---
And I am sorry, but the longer layering is in the game then the longer we have to deal with the exploits we've been seeing in regards to layer hopping and the economy being heavily impacted.  3 instances of the server pouring resources into the same AH and inflating gold all the faster with world farming spots now being farmed x3 is absolutely going to have an impact on the game.
---
Keep in mind that there will be 3 STV chests, 3 fishing competitions, 3 sets of resource nodes, 3 sets of raid world buffs being turned in of the same type for each layer (nullifying the one balancing factor of world buffs) and I am sure plenty of other things I am simply not remembering, but will become clear as we get into the official release and into end game. 
---
The reason I called it illogical is because it doesn't cover every potential scenario.  It relies on the absolute necessity that enough people quit the game in a short period of time so that it can be removed.  All that means is that Blizzard isn't placing a whole lot of faith in the project, or simply don't care to.
---
&gt; Pretty sure holy shock is fire damage?

&gt;&gt; holy shock is fire damage?

&gt;&gt;&gt; holy shock?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; holy?

Make every AV I enter last hours.
---
too bad you are slow af
---
Female Undead has a better run animation, and since you're doing that from level 1-39 and forever in any raid/dungeon it's the clear choice.
---
Show her that one Female Troll face. The one that is pretty and) human-like,  that 90% of people use. You guys know the one I'm talking about. Perhaps show her that one.
---
damn that's cool, wish I could made my gf play but since I'm going for 24h stream, she decided to make sure the house doesn't burn down in the meantime : )
---
Play the game. See where it takes me.
---
The other priests hated me because I was class leader, and for whatever reason our guild had shit luck with priest drops and apparently it was my fault.  I tried a lot of different systems to make it fair for loot, but none of it worked because nothing ever dropped.
---
Playing most recently as druid was pretty awesome though, met some cool mother fuckers.  It was tons of fun hanging out in our druid channel during raids.
---
In a dungeon a mage gives water for free to everybody that needs it.
---
On a PvP server, I like to stop and help members of the opposing faction escort their chickens. I can just imagine them going “fuck, I’m gonna get ganked and have to do this again!” but then nope, help instead. I like to think sometimes, I put the war aside and help someone instead, it adds another layer of community to the game.
---
Yeah I don't know what to tell you there. It \*could\* be because Shadowform is actually the only "stance" that doesn't trigger a stance shift in Action Bars like Stealth and Druid forms do?
---
How did I miss that?  
---
Disregard my last.
---
Ah, so the max rank thing is only for wotlk onwards. That's  what I wanted to know.
---
I'll check that stream out. I didn't realise that classes were designed to have different roles at different stages in leveling.
---
/u/Crimsonak not sure if you missed it, but right clicking the shadowform buff \*also\* triggers a GCD. I think it may be because it's a stance that didn't change action bars like rogue stealth and druid forms? Nice find btw!
---
I was going to go alch/herb on my druid.then I remembered how I never got that finkle Skinner even after 50+ runs... I have to get it this time!
---
Is the Cursed Eye available for horde at all, or is it an alliance only quest?
---
Paladin tanks have shortcomings, yet are still useful in their own way. Righteous fury generates a stupid amount of threat with all the holy damage you'll be doing, and you have access to all the support abilities paladin has to offer.
---
Their main weakness is a lack of taunt and having a mana pool. This doesnt mean they lack the ability to gain and hold threat, but it takes time and mana for them to build up threat. Without mana, you are completely and utterly useless.
---
What you could do is play the support role in raids. Having a 4th tank tanking welps, adds and some AQ40 bossfights, paired with a nightfall and healing is useful enough to warrant a raid spot in my book.
---

---
All valid points, I'm wrong here.
---
Tank, be key man and form the group with reserve,
---
Expel
---
So if tomorrow someone find an exploit that break the game and was in vanilla, it should be in classic ?
---
If it wasn't used in vanilla, it means it isn't bound to the authenticity of that experience, so it doesn't have to be a part of Classic.
---
Back in Wrath we had 4 (sometimes 5) shaman in our raid team, and I miss those times so much. When all five of us got together and did a 5s team of 4 resto shaman and an elesham and we actually won a few... best time ever.
---
Team Totem was the best team.
---
Been working on a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aUwpMF1IiCy7KeM9ecneFLD4rjMWbF8aHTl_vYFFXik/edit?usp=sharing) for calculating mana efficiency if anyone is interested.
---
Hopefully it will help alleviate some of this problem.
---
This will honestly take a few years lol depending on job/family life
---
They also have an incentive to do so in the hopes that players go to retail in that downtime, or just keep their sub open.
---
The name your own pet like yourself was a common thing for pvp as you could mess with people /target macros as they would always return the closest entity.
---
Not that it would have made any difference as even the early dmg meters would factor a hunters pet into his/her overall dmg.
---
Figures, all the alliance children are now in college 😁
---
Make the bumper sticker... I’ll buy it
---
Can we not spread the meme that layering is for saving blizzard money.
---
I got to rank 14 as troll shaman so :/
---
Professions that create things (Engineering, Blacksmithing, Leatherworking, Tailoring, Alchemy, Enchanting*) all cost resources. 
---
Resources all boil down to gold. 
---
Professions that gain resources are: Skinning, Herbalism, Mining
---
There are pros and cons to picking up a profession that costs money, almost every one has unique gear that can only be used if you have that profession, at the same time, it costs a lot of money &amp; time to level them to 300.
---
thank fucking god, now if you could take your shitty attitude and hatred of this community and fuck off i'm sure most people here would thank you.
---
Seriously wtf are you here, just to troll and be a jerk?  Don't worry i don't really care what your response is.
---
Try Turtle-WoW, it's the best :3
---
Because you seem to be completely ignoring the possibility that more people join than quit in the first quarter of classic's release.  
---
History has shown us that as a new game it grew insanely fast despite having an extremely bad launch (arguably worse than any other MMORPG launch to date).
---
To be fair, that is because it was new, however we do have an example with another game.  OSRS only had gains in total population for almost 2 years straight until having no additional content became stale (which is when they started polling in new content).  Just because a game is old, doesn't mean it wont attract players so long as the game itself is fun to play.  
---
So with that said, if there are too many players playing by the time phase 2 rolls around, then they either have to keep layering and allow 3 sets of world bosses to be up at any given time, or they would have to remove it anyway and have 10k~ people trying to log into a 3.5k cap server during peak times. 
---
That is the potential issue that exists.  And quite frankly, it is more likely that the game doesn't bleed out players in a mere 3 months to the point of losing 60%~ of its playerbase to let them remove layering.  
---
The only way that is going to happen is if Blizzard purposely tries to keep classic hidden from a more public view (basically no advertising like they do current retail) and create a scenario where it does bleed out players as to avoid needing to hire more employees and host more servers.
---
Hammer of justice?
---
My old roommate and I used to play 40k daily, splitting games up into 1-2 turn chunks over a few days.
---
He played IG. His line of thought was exactly this. "I just like the idea of being a bunch of regular-ass dudes fighting against giant space daemons."
---
The idea grew on me after a while. Though, I play Tau, for the greater good.
---
Its a pretty basic utilitarian mindset.  I'm not here to make friends (but if I do, cool, I guess), I'm here to quickly and reliably kill internet dragons and collect shiny pixels.
---
I work at least 40 hours a week, sometimes I work 80 hours a week, and anything in between.  I don't have time to deal with loot drama or poor raid performance.  Pull your weight and don't waste my time, and I (and the rest of the raid) won't waste yours.  Its a 25, or in Classics case, a 40 way street.  Everyone does their job, does it well, and no ones time gets wasted or feelings get hurt.  Why stress about who gets what first and why they get it when in the course of a typical content cycle, barring shit like TF or Hand of Rag, you're going to get rained on with purples as long as you show up every raid.
---
Hopefully you can find a guild that suits your wants and needs come release!
---
md doesn't exist in classic
---
And that's why I think classic is just the best version of WoW, and this is coming from someone who started playing in WotlK.
---
Everything just matters more.
---
In addition to that comment, here's another description he gave of their philosophy on the ClassiCast podcast:
---
&gt; So, Prot Paladin is supposed to be damage from being hit, right? Retribution Aura, Holy Shield, You know? I would generate threat this way, I would punish evil for daring to attack me. And then on top of that we wanted his taunt to be more of a rescue operation than a direct insult, right? Like a Warrior is just like: Hey you, you’re a jerk, come attack me. Very direct. I’m intimidating. Whereas for a Paladin the idea was Oh one of my frieds is in trouble, I’ll cast a spell on my friend and it will transfer the threat to me and get that monster to come over and, right? So that’s more in mind with the thematic of he’s a protector and a saver rather than, you know, like a direct yelling and screaming.
---
&gt; So that’s was the thematic approach. The mechanics were difficult because it was much harder to switch targets and use an ability on a friend without the smart targeting stuff that eventually went in. It wasn’t just, you know, hit taunt on the thing that you were already targeting so we had some mechanical difficulties. He was fine generating threat as long as the thing was on him, but once it was off him it was really difficult to get it back on him so that he could go back to generating threat, where as the Warrior was more direct and, you know, consistent.
---
&gt; It’s one of those things where we didn’t have the idea worked out yet and we didn’t want to just band-aid it by giving him a taunt, because once you give him a taunt you can’t take it away, right? Like anything less than that or even different than that and people are going to be like, why? why would you do this to us, just give us the thing back. It’s very difficult to take mechanics away. We didn’t have the total specific idea worked out on how he was actually going to taunt so we were still experimenting and learning as we went but our goal and **our philosophy was always do it different; make the bear tank a certain way, make the paladin tank a certain way make the warrior tank a certain way and to a lesser extent make the void walker tank a certain way**, just have him feel differently, have the function differently so that they give a different experience and it changes the dynamic of the group and how people have to play and there’s different things going on.
---
The guild I'm in takes into account your dedication level.
---
Do you help people get BiS geared in 5 mans/UBRS, are you assisting the guild in general. The guild is MORE than just clearing content. We are min maxers for the most part, but we also take into account how much you help the guild, are you using consumables. If you just raid-log it will be looked down upon even if you're a good player.
---
The what now?
---
How could that ever be a fun part of wow? Nothing pisses me off more than that. I have a limited amount of time to play and if someone ganks me that fucks up 10 minutes of my play time. It ruins the entire game for me, hence why pve realms exist.
---
I like it.
---
Believe its Alliance Only
---
HOJ is holy as well.
---
Better question is which rogue didn't hurt him?
---
Having pallys on your side is also nice as a lock and you can save fears for when wotf is on cd or for those pesky orcs. The rest of us can stun the uds.
---
There's still a spot for a lock in bg premades on ally side so you are good.
---
Please go slow.  Enjoy it.
---
This is it
---
Yeah it's Holy, literally the only spell according to wowhead that isn't holy is Turn Undead lol.
---
Same.  Always had a strange playstyle between all specs from vanilla all the way through wrath.  
---
To each their own, but that is the one and only class I just couldn't play beyond lvl 20~ due to how boring it was.
---
That's because it doesn't magically just "happen". We do it.
---
Tip for beginners, regarding keybindings. Unbind "turn left" and "turn right" and if you use WASD (for example) set A and D to strafe left and right.
---
Neither do I. Have heard people say otherwise but makes so sense any other way.
---
We had a rogue that refused to attack the ass-end of raid bosses and would regularly fuck up (or nearly fuck up) our MT thanks to Parries.
---
Melee is hard.
---
yeah but eventually you will level with both of them and Pally/War is better at mass PvP than Pally/Lock.
---
I have something wonderful for you, a community of likeminded individuals. It's called r/classicwowplus and it's small right now, but if you build it, they will come :)  
---
Please understand that posting this kinda stuff here is not unlike a retail player asking for LFR and world quests to be implemented (which is sacrilege of the highest order). It's not what \*we\* asked for, it's not what \*we\* want.
---
Yes that is correct.
---
Not a chance.
---
Sadly, if wrath did one thing I felt was a nice QoL change (I know many shaman mains disliked it at the time though) was when you could drop 4 preset totems down at once.  
---
Before wrath, I just couldn't bring myself to stick with them.
---
How is your comment any better/more productive lol
---
On your private server, does it trigger a GCD if you right click the buff to remove it? Like right click the aura next to the minimap (assuming you got your buffs there)
---
Completely disagree. Playing Hunter in BC and WotLK was one of the most wellrounded, versatile and interesting experiences of my history in the game (vanilla &gt; BFA). I am not talking about the steadt shot macro spam in late BC, but the depth the class offered in dungeons, pvp etc. was second to none. I absolutely loved that class and was pretty darn good at it. It took at week with “focus” for me to completely lose interest in it and I havent touched it since.
---
Imp conc is 15%, so better than nothing but still brutal.  And bait the rogue means what, fake casting?  It's kind of hard to bait the mage when hes 30m away right?
---
Priest healing was arguably at its most enjoyable states in vanilla and TBC.  Very tactical rather than reflexive.
---
Ahh I read OPs post as leveling. For PvP yeah War/Pally. For leveling efficiency it’s Lock/Pally
---
I need to be part of the AQ phase so I can finally find out if C’thun whispers anything before MCing you and destroying Gadgetzan bruisers (and your rep with them).
---
Runes and flasks are a world of difference from the made-up problem that this video is describing.
---
Ok so I offered advice friendly and all nice In order to help 
---
I’m pretty sure if you ask any top healer they will tell you exactly same the same as I did.
---
It’s not my fault if your just bad and can’t see it as true about my advice 
---
I mean come on even in classic your healer drinks in between each pull for 6-10 secs and position between current pack and next to be ready for the next pack
---
you whine and start flaming I think I know who’s a troll and hater
---
&gt;Retail WoW is an O
---
I'd give you gold if I could, mate.
---
Retail and Classic are practically night and day though.
---
Whatever you experience in Retail is not going to transfer over to Classic except some minor details. 
---
A lot of people on here are going to give you a rosy outlook at the game, and that's of course their opinion on it. 
---
Realistically though, Classic is a much different beast. 
---
First and foremost, you have to be OK with spending a lot of time on this game in order to get stuff done. Want to do that 5 man dungeon? Depending on your class / role, time of day, and player population, getting a group, ***when you want it***, is going to take 5-10mins. 
---
Then another 5-10mins to get everyone to the dungeon (it'll take longer the further out the dungeon is).
---
Then about 30-50mins to complete this dungeon if you have a smooth run (no wipes). 
---
That is, if you even get past the finding the group part. It varies heavily based on the above variables. 
---
Secondly, not every class / spec is created equal. If you get on retail right now, pick a class / spec of your choice, you can typically perform well.
---
On Retail, as a Prot Paladin, (at level 20) I have an on use damage reduction ability, an AoE ability, and the ability to Taunt. The absolute basics you need for tanking. 
---
In Classic it's much different. 
---
Your only on use damage reduction abilities come in the form of a 31pt talent in protection, Holy Shield (at level 40). Your only AoE ability comes in the form of Consecration, which is 21pts into Holy (you can get this at level 20). You are ***never*** given a taunt. It does not exist for Prot paladins in Classic. However, Warriors and Druids get this ability. I guess Blizzard forgot? 
---
Trying to be a Prot paladin in Classic is borderline impossible. 
---
So be careful. If you play retail and fall in love with a class / spec, that spec may not even be viable / grossly under perform compared to other classes in Classic.
---
What you can do is play Retail with the general idea of what the class does. Paladins are champions of Light and use holy magic. Druids are nature focused. Rogues are sneaky beaky, etc. 
---
From there pick which kind of class you think interests you and then research how they will play out. So if you wanted to be a Prot Paladin, you're kind of SoL.
---
can u dm me
---
Shamans have rez?...
---
Which class would be the most fun to have as a leveling partner? I have some skeptical friends and I want to get them hooked as quickly as possible, and do everything I can to make that happen.
---
I just use (new) reddit. Might not be to everyones taste, but I prefer consistent style and dark theme across all boards.
---
Sorry, but it did, before they broke the mechanisms that resulted in it.
---
Once you hit 40 (when the real grind begins) then pally/warrior all the way.
---
Before 40, warrior duo is questionable at best.
---
A feature is that didn't exist in classic is the best way to recreate classic... genius.
---
That’s the real skill gap in the class and exceptional rogues know how to pool energy, they will outshine in PvP.
---
Why is Truefaith Vestment better than Robes of the Exalted?

I'm not sure how important that 14 stamina is but for me the spirit and int seems better.
---
Damn I remember them, I was Thunderlord Horde as well
---
Classic DB lists no level required on quest reward weapons, which is what the question is about. You have to click the item, look at what quest it's a reward from, and see the required level for the quest. From the Beta, we know that even this level requirement is not necessarily true, because it would let you follow quest chains if you did the prereqs that you were level appropriate for. So there's no easy way to search the way OP wants, but generally I'd filter by *item* level ranged 5 levels below target level, and up to 10 levels higher than target range. Also filter required level at maximum the target level, but no minimum so it catches quest rewards. Then sort by dps and click on the ones with no required level to see the quest details
---
No, because communities still exist today. They still get built today. Friendships are still made today.
---
By the people who choose to make them.
---
Yes, gotta get that +Arcane damage to make blink, polymorph and mana shield stronger...
---
How long in terms of hours do people put into this grind?
---
Me and the boys finding the poopsock
---
That post is dated 2008 which is when wotlk came out and changed spell down ranking completely.
---
That's just because they are larger.
---
It's like the Cho'gath effect in League of Legends.  Once you become monstrous you feel slow but only because of your size.
---
Stream sniping will be a major thing it seems.
---
Good.
---
Blizzard really dropped the ball on Paladins in vanilla. The pre-wrath patch made up for it though :)
---
Will do!!
---
Bleh, you're right. 
---
Perhaps it would be better if they chose a different payment model. I mean, they're the ones causing issue of tourism by including Classic to the sub. In 2004, there were no tourists, no crazy initial hype that's expected to die in a month...
---
Will do! Thanks!
---
The game will be subscription based, you don't need to buy anything.
---
On retail I bought gold over 20 times or so between WotLK and Cata. I even got caught one time but all they did was take the gold back.
---
Idk if this is common, but my friends and I never got in any trouble for doing it over the years.
---
Undead were actually Undead type in beta as well.  Which boosted paladin strength as they have bonuses against undead.  But they changed this as well..
---
If my memory isn't failing me Undead actually had permanent WOTF while also having the negatives of being affected by undead only spells.
---
From my experience it doesn’t. Granted wasn’t beta but stress tests had layering in combat out the wazoo.
---
I mean, if the mage has given me water I'm not *that* annoyed over it. I'll drink the microsecond I can and usually it's enough to get through the next pack.
---
Female orc is the best option for gear
---
By level 10 pallies have two shields, a stun, lay on hands, a cleanse, and two heals. Pretty damn good for level 10.
---
This was gold! Thank you!
---
Well the last time I played retail for any real amount of time was during wod, and it’s hard to imagine a more trivial game world in an MMO. I made upgrades to my raid gear in my keep without even playing. So unless it’s gotten much better since then, we’ll have to agree to disagree.
---
Thunderlord represent!
---
YOUR ALL DEAD.
---
SEE YOU ALL IN STV
---
Ah. Good to know
---
different people enjoy different things. feel free to roll on pve to avoid getting ganked
---
That's cool, a sensible QOL improvement.  Discord is definitely better than Vent or TS but still kind of clunky to set up with strangers.  Being on the "server wide" discord is probably best like some of the pservers have.
---
Thank you
---
&gt; They can "take a break" to get back some mana during combat because of a talent ability that allows them to utilize passive mana gain from their spirit during combat.
---
Every class has that. What priests and druids have are talents that allow some of their spirit mana regen to function while they're casting
---
Yeah it does. Another user has found that this was fixed in patch 2.3.0. Now the question is: show this be fixed, or let it be?
---
I’m a tank and I pull fast and consistently while also not losing aggro. 
---
I do watch my healers mana. But you don’t need to be at full mana for every trash pull. If I noice the healer is above like 70-80% I keep going.
---
I’ve had healers who day im Oom at 70% mana and they ask me to slow down. Like what?
---
If there’s one thing all mages can agree on, it’s that locks are the worst.
---
Boar is underrated for PvP kiting.  Flag capping and deadzone management was much more powerful with the boar snare.
---
Everyone always wanted fast attack to cancel mage casting.  But hunters do great against casters.  It's the rogue/warrior up in your grill that you actually need help with.
---
Interesting... Like mind flay?
---
To you. What about RPer’s?
---
Amen. Oooo look at me my frostbolts are black. 
---
Get a job you hippies.
---
Major for like 20 people out of thousands
---
I was referring to an individual level where spells become available.  Divine Protection is level 6. Purify is level 8. Lay on hands is 10. 
---
All of the spells pictured above become available at level 20, along with teleport. So therefore level 20 Mage is the most OP level in terms of sheer amount of spells instantly available.
---
\+1 my first 3 points every time I level a rogue ar for imp gouge. You can kite mobs, or gouge - bandage in pve. And gouge - Restealth in PvP. I can't imagine any build without it
---
I hate mages
---
Why is that amazing?
---
Still good.
---
No your wrong because it costs like 2g to train all that bullshit
---
This is me pre-2004.
---
Healers probably have the lowest requirement to be the "best". All healers will always be in demand.  
---
That said, don't expect Guilds to be seeking you out if you decide to play a Shadow Priest (the DPS spec for Priests).
---
If you plan to level with your friends, perhaps you might consider something that is complementary to them.  
---
For example, my friend wants to play a Warrior so we'vre going to duel-level with me on a Priest.  
---
Warrior's biggest problem with leveling is their downtime for regenerating health, with a healer at their side this is almost completely mitigated.
---
I'd recommend looking at all the Vanilla Flavors class guides, they're funny and succinct.

I always enjoyed picking up the off piece that is perfect but leather for my mail wearing champion or that really good mail piece on my warrior.  Of course when the appropriate wearing class didn't need it (not stealing BiS leather from a rogue int he same group for instance).
---
Having to only get leather for rogue or cloth for lock/priest/mage just feels bad.  I don't play any of those 4 classes. (for other reasons too mind you).
