as a rogue who isnt at stv yet I sadly cannot use that..what i need to do is set mine for auberdine so i have access to both the boat to menethil and all the EK fps as well as all the FPs from kalimdor

oh is that what happened? lol its fucking crazy laggy here. ppl loading in as you move around around, everyone stuck in animations

Using ampified curse of weakness + shrinking ray on melee lowbies while they are fighting a mob is amusing.

Warlock here. It's completely reasonable for you to tell them to not expect heals if they're going to lifetap down to 10%. A lot of warlocks also play poorly - they apply too many dots and then too many shadow bolts. The key as a warlock is to get a pulse for how fast things will die, and how much mana is really worth spending on any given target. If you cast a DoT you should be sure that you'll get the full duration. Generally if a warlock casts Curse of Agony and Corruption, life taps a few times, and sends a shadow bolt (or two) that's more than enough.
---
Tell the warlocks to manage their own health better. Health is a resource - life taps should be a resource to keep the DPS flowing, not to keep your healer's mana bar empty.
---
Now for the bullets:
---
* Use your healthbar as a mana bar if it makes sense to do so. If the pace of the group allows for more frequent eating, let the healers know that you'll be life tapping and eating food. If you want to life tap a bunch at the end of a pull where everyone's going to sit and eat, that's good. Do not expect heals if you life tap out of combat. Just don't.
---
* It depends on your spec, but let's just assume you'll be affliction based. Cast Agony and Corruption (somtimes only one or the other). If it's a very tanky mob, cast Siphon Life so you can life tap a bit more freely. If it's a very tanky mob (or boss) cast a Curse (not always agony! use your toolbox!), Corruption, Immolate, Siphon Life, and then do whatever else you need to do (shadow bolts, etc).
---
* Generally you will not use Drain Life in dungeons unless you have aggro. Corruption procs Shadow Mastery, which is your real bread and butter. Sometimes that will attract aggro, which then makes it useful to use Drain Life.
---
Oh and for god's sake if your group wants to use Hellfire, communicate about it. If you just Hellfire and make the tank's life hell, and the healer miserable, you'll just die.
---
It was a rethorical question but thanks for the info.
---
How much money do you think they make off people who unsub..? Some people will unsub if the game gets stagnant. Who knows if they'd make more money bringing out content to fewer customers over 2 years or to more customers over 1 year.
---
Level as arms. You can still tank easily. I'll say it again EASILY. I 2h Sword everything on my war from 1-40 and didnt have any issue holding aggro (some exceptions of course, like people focusing an npc I hadn't even had a chance to hit yet). You'll likely regret leveling as prot unless you have a squad you roll with all the time. Even if you have a squad I'd do arms leveling. Sweeping strikes with cleave/WW and a 2h sword was a lot of fun.
---
If people are bitching about you not being prot from 1-50 (I don't go prot till 54 at earliest)...they dumb.
---
No, no it is not. If something is an upgrade then BoE or not you roll on it and use it. You do not ‚Äúneed it just as much‚Äù because you can sell the item and buy something you want instead.
---
By that logic I could start rolling need on every single item - weapons especially! 5-7 gold a pop at the vendor? That‚Äôll certainly help my epic mount fund, and a mount is equipment so therefore I need it just as much as you... right?
---
I‚Äôve never had anybody in groups for 15 years not understand this and would simply kick anyone who tried that crap. Hell we had the epic DM book drop first day and guess what? We gave it to the tank, who now has one hell of a bitching sword.
---
respec dude.
---
Tactical mastery is the best talent in the game for a warrior once you get whirwlind.  As soon as you can get tactical mastery + bloodthirst go back to fury.
---
How do you get the costume? Saw a mage cast it on me earlier
---
Mount gold? *Laughs in warlock*
---
lol uuuvan mad, that he can't beat this argument so he deferred to "your flawed and stupid" "it's been debunked" ad homanim. L O FUCKING L
---
I always return buffs, but I'm a warlock so they always get an unending breath or detect invis üòÇ
---
I main a hunter and I have had so many rogues and warriors try to ninja ranged weapons because the pre-BIS  list told them to.
---
How much fire resist should I have  for raiding as a rogue?
---
My main is 35
---
This is the true answer
---
You actually lick pussy ? Hahahaha groce
---
(I assume he has instant CoA)
---
&gt;it's as legitimate as "hey I think these cloth healing gloves would be a small upgrade for my paladin". 
---
And this is where this type of sentiment falls flat in the classic community. Is it of the same value? Sure, by some subjective system of scales that you've made, while a much larger amount of people have said 'hey, if that's a legit upgrade for him let 'em fucking have it.'
---
Need over Greed, as the developers intended
---
&gt; Mostly due to how set bonuses work. Weapons, rings, necks, and trinkets were easily replaced prior to 65 in most cases.
---
not even this is true. this entire thing has got to be one of the biggest myths in world of warcraft history. in fact, a ton of items from t4 &amp; t5 content had to be buffed and/or reworked after release (some even had to be buffed twice) because they were so weak in comparison to naxx gear, and even after the buffs most items aren't that much better if at all.
---
the average naxx item is much better than the average item from t4 content. obviously there are weapons, that naturally are better just for sheer damage no matter the stats. there are also some select items with insane stat allocation that beats naxx gear, but in general what you say isn't true. almost any random item from naxx would be near if not on top of pre-raid TBC bis lists, and a ton of AQ items are on par as well.

Same with me! Just rerolled to a different server and went alliance for the first time ever. Hopefully I don‚Äôt regret it
---
Welcome to socialism.
---
I agree he should have talked over what to do if it dropped, and I get that people are super hesitant to hit greed and open the door for someone else to need on it... but the conversation should have allowed for him to manually roll and hopefully the winner  respects it.
---
Generally when a high value item drops though you absolutely don‚Äôt just click. Check with the run before rolling.
---
Lol, some dude in our guild the other day (massive guild) was like "Hey guys, I was enjoying hanging out with some people I met doing dungeons, and everyone in this guild is a lot higher level than me, so I am going to join their guild. Thanks for the fun times!". Everyone was thanking him for saying something and wishing him good luck (massive guild like this its pretty normal to see a few g quits a day where they say nothing). 
---
Few minutes go by, and the same dude goes "uhhhh how do I leave the guild?". 
---
I fucking /gquit myself trying to show him how, and he wasn't even trying to bait people. I had to be reinvited to much laughter.
---
thanks
---
I actually ran into a dirtbag warrior advertising "Jed/Rend runs" who had no intention of fishing for Jed. They were just advertising it as a Jed run because "we'll just run it and if he's up he's up".
---
Ran with them once because Jed was in fact up, then portalled out.
---
 Spy addon is lame for sure.
---
somthing tells me the prize money is going to be shared by people colluding. The fact that the rogue did not get punished is clearly bias
---
That addon is really broken in pvp and i do wish blizzard broke it but the odds are they won't. Because its a gray area slippery slope mambo jambino kinda thing
---
Noticed it works, but you also lose DPS somehow. 
---
I think it's not adding the multi shot and aimed shot damage but still counting as a auto attack cast
---
You also don't see groups waiting an hr in lfg for a healer. Supply and demand.
---
Mental illness, depression, addiction, etc. No matter how OP spins it, there is no good reason to be playing a game for 13 hours a day.
---
I believe a lot of people, especially at low levels, see an item as having more value in terms of gold. Most these items you will replace in less than 10 levels. 
---
For example, if someone took shadowfang and equipped it knowing they are going to out level it in a day or so of game time, a lot of people would be upset due to the gold value. 
---
The rule I‚Äôve seen in every dungeon group so far is need on every blue BoE regardless of who needs it as an upgrade.
---
yea obviously assuming dps is similar, slower oh will be more inconsistent rage generation though

TRIES
---
&gt;made up scenario in your head, 
---
Not sure why you keep insisting this doesn't happen in-game. It does. You can pretend all you like, but it won't change reality. Anyway...
---
&gt;what if h y p o t h e t I c a l l y we both intend to sell the item, but I use the gold for a BiS items, and you use it to buy mats instead of taking the time to farm them, is the value still absolute? 
---
The value of BoE's is never truly absolute to begin with, nor is the value of time spent farming.
---
&gt;What if, h y p o t h e t I c a l l y, I know if a buyer on the server who is paying above market value for the item, whereas you sell it on the AH for its average price, so I turn the item into much more gold than you would have, are those values the same?
---
You've just now described *why* the value of BoE's is never absolute. But lets translate this line of thinking back to the original scenario. If a BoE is a bigger upgrade for Player1 than it is for Player2, does that mean Player1 should get the item? Would player 2 be "greedy" because they don't receive as much value from the item as Player1 would have?
---
&gt;Need&gt;greed
---
We've already established that it's not greed in this scenario when the end result for both players winning would be a shiny new piece of gear
---
There's a very good chance they will drop BG's early when people realize how fucking shit world pvp ranking is, once the thrill of "omg haha look at this hillsbrad battle hahaha" wears off and people start complaining about being corpsecamped and cannot move outside of capital cities. They have shown they are not hard set on the phases so that 's why a lot of people think they will release bg's early now.
---
This spec only gives the 15% boost to shadow fire if you sac a imp or succubus and if you sac the pet, you‚Äôre losing out of the 5 points you have allocated into the pet talents as well as master summoner. It looks like it‚Äôs a lose/lose
---
Edit: just kidding I had to re-read master summoner. This looks kinda cool actually but I would still rather play either with a pet or without one cause wasting all those talents when you sac would just feel mega bad. Also you don‚Äôt have access to corruption which just seems wrong
---
42 here as well. Out of game time. Waiting on payday to continue the journey!
---
As a night elf I often try to help Taurens. Take mob off them, cast a dot on their enemy running next to them etc. I'm way more friendly to Taurens then to gnomes lol

You ran into ass hats here and there but EVERYONE was replaceable and still are. This isn‚Äôt retail where you click a button and poof someone magically appears. You can pick and choose more in Classic because you‚Äôre localized to one server. You get a rep of wanting to reserve stuff every run then people won‚Äôt run with you mainly because there‚Äôs always gonna be another Tank/or DPS wanting to go that isn‚Äôt gonna pull the BS.
---
Same here. If a person has a problem playing a female character, by extension they should also have a problem playing every race other than humans and dwarves. 
---
Personally, I just don't like how cloth armour looks on males.
---
It's a-ok to be a 15 foot man-cow as long as you don't have breasts, I guess.
---
Deciding between a human warrior and a human rogue. Don't have as much time to play as I used to, but still want to reach 60 and gear up eventually. Which class will be better suited for my situation? Less time to play, will likely have to play solo for a lot of it, etc.
---
Just discuss how people should roll before the dungeon starts, or when it drops
---
My Microsoft surface Pro 4 with the i5 runs it well. It just runs REALLY hot after a few minutes.
---
There are a few toys in retail that can get you drunk so that probably helps too.
---
Glad both the text and image are unique and definitely not things everyone keeps repeating.
---
put them on blast
---
Now compare this with Ironforge lol
---
&gt;They just want it to sell for mount gold.
---
YOU should be selling it for mount gold, too. Everyone should. The only items that matter for low levels are the weapons or wands. Everything else has practically no effect on levelling speed. 0.8 dps, 30 extra health and 0.05 percentage point less physical damage taken is never worth the opportunity cost of not selling the item.
---
Haha YES! I do this too! Polymorph them until they resist it, use a low level Frost Nova so they can't run, then polymorph some more. Since they don't die they can't even resurrect to escape.
---
How about fuck the opinions of the twats on reddit and do whatever you want however you want. That‚Äôs the glory of classic
---
Looks like people in this thread have the...

Warrior tanks often just stand there with health missing when others drink / eat.

anything goes. AP, crit or hit, high weapon damage.
---
&amp;#x200B;

For 14 AP you get +1 dps on your weapons
---
This is amazing. It's simply not possible we don't have the computing power to combine every realm. What's the bottleneck in these types of situations? Software? Blizzard's server software?
---
^this. Haha, and you guys also kinda announced it on r/ Yojamba so.....
---
Followup for anyone willing to answer: does Darnassus rep matter if you're a night elf?
---
I mean, warlocks are literally barely better than spriests lol
---
The difference is shadow *needs* a selfish debuff for SW:P to be competitive. That's the only reason spriests usage is restricted in raids.
---
No you are misunderstanding my question. I already did that and that‚Äôs how my wolf knows howl and bite. However they are rank 1 as opposed to rank 2 or 3. My previous bear pet went from claw 1 to claw 3 all on his own. My question is why isn‚Äôt my wolf doing that with how and bite or how do I get him to do that.
---
Eh just spam dungeons this is what I did as a pally as soon as I hit 53ish. Respecced holy and just did dungeons all the way to 60
---
Afaik, realm pop reports are no longer accurate.
---
Someone in a big guild who will prevent you from grouping with 100s of players. With server population diminishing every month it is only going to get worse.
---
or less, as in smaller shadowbolts.
---
Actually, can you downrank shadowbolts? Is that as stupid as it sounds to me?
---
You can get the reed really quick in a farming group tho. Or with guildies. Everyone leaves party, checks for him, someone finds him very quickly. Kill him. Reset. It's pretty quick.
---
Is it really ninja if it is bis? That‚Äôs just rolling on your best upgrade
---
None this phase. Fire Protection pots are all you need.
---
so, basically, just giant assholes.
---
i had this same thing happen. Warden Staff dropped in ZF and we had a Druid Tank, who predictably went crazy over it. unfortunately, the other people in the group immediately rolled Need on it, though, one person passed. i whispered the tank saying i was gonna Need it and hand it to him if i won to give him a better chance. luckily, he won and equipped it immediately, so, there was no future drama.
---
i just don't get people like this, tho. in a perfect world, people wouldn't have to roll Need on BoEs to prevent people from ninjaing them and selling them for loot. unfortunately, there's not much we can do about it.
---
tbh, i never experienced this shit in Vanilla/BC when i played them originally. this crap must be from the retail WoW crowd or the private server crew.
---
My three year old would probably roll a rogue and just gank lowbies.
---
No, he‚Äôs not good at the game. He‚Äôs just that much of an asshole. I‚Äôm so proud.
---
Loved playing on aldor. Lots of rp that made the world feel a little more lively and immersive
---
In the future? Yes.
---
In two months? (The time it would take to lvl and gear a new rogue.) No chance.
---
Most rogues I know are either memelords or quiet. Haha.
---
Cruise control but with occasional moments of getting a flat tire at 90mph.
---
Not if its implemented like Winterspring trainers where you need tiger riding.
---
This needs to be front page. You should post this as a single write up. 
---
I‚Äôm employed with a family and this is exactly what I do. I get so tired of people saying hurrdeehurrhurr you must be a loser with no job and no friends because I know how to use my time efficiently
---
*did blizz reduce the amount of layers*
---
what level is a good level to do maraudon? i just hit 46. i remember that the end boss is... 51? or something. i'm a healer, tho, so, i could probably sneak in earlier.
---
I‚Äôm P1 BiS, max professions with a bunch of patterns only 2/3 people on the server possess. I‚Äôve got multiple epic mounts and 3000g sitting around. 
---
Doesn‚Äôt really compare to ‚Äòa few pieces of T1‚Äô, but congratulations on your progress. üòâ
---
just stupid people not understanding that LFG in classic was never similar to the bad LFG implemented in retail 
---
finding people to invite is completely different than the game automatically placing randos from other servers into your party.
---
Yo dawg we got 40 innervates. We'll be fine!
---
After all phases are done, Id like them to continue with Classic's content that never made it due to time.  For example Kara was originally slated for Classic but got added to TBC due to time restraints. There is some other content as well out there, couple youtube videos on the matter. Uldum, Caverns of Time (Although Im not into the time travel stuff), Hyjal, Emerald Dream, Azshara BG.  This is all content that was scraped during the Original Classic but later introduced at some point down the road.  Once all the original classic content is done and played out I think they should start with added stuff like that. And eventually add new content (TBD). Take the game down a whole different path, it will take at least 8 years to derail once again.  Classic was good, TBC was good, WotLK was good, Cata was decent, MoP was sub-par, WoD was shit, Legion was Average w/ horrible mechanics/grinds, BFA is shit.  Going to take a couple years for blizz to hit the shit status again.
---
That was going to happen regardless. If no expac came out the players would have got bored and shelved the game.
---
Did not know this was possible. Thanks for improving my experience.
---
2/10 too cringy
---
Several ways? PvP trinket, Ice Block (yikes on wasting block on fear unless you‚Äôre also trying to drop DoTs), reflecting fear requires an engineering trinket and there are better things to reflect. How are you becoming immune to fear for 30 seconds?
---
Edit: maybe you mean https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10418/glimmering-mithril-insignia which is a BoP blacksmithing trinket that requires 225 blacksmithing to use so it‚Äôs not like you could make it and then drop BS because it‚Äôs otherwise pretty useless on a mage.
---
I tried hunter, and slightly considered it, but I think that ranged classes are a little boring. I'd rather be up close as melee.
---
alerting players to a stealthed player isn't a grey area.
---
edit: 10 second downvote. I hope I didn't hurt your butt by disagreeing too bad. Please don't hurt your pet or girlfriend :( It's not their fault bro.
---
&gt;  Sure, by some subjective system of scales that you've made
---
The "subjective system of scales I've made" is "everyone should get a fair chance for drops that have value to them", and your system is *more* subjective.
---
You make me want to reroll on a RP server.
---
u do know its bannable....
---
fun times when u get banned.
---
No1 cares
---
Bannable times
---
Your rule only applies to BIS boe's, not pre 60 items.  The drop could be sold by the other group members to buy their own upgrade, should they wish to purchase one.
---
Just because it has stats for you, doesnt make it automatically yours ü§ì.  Remember, you wouldnt have had the opportunity to roll on it without your group, its just common courtesy to allow them the same opportunity.
---
Ok, now what? I mean, what‚Äôs the point? Scummy ninja looters exist, we all know that. But trolls do aswell.
---
Nice source bro.
---
Imp kidney shot on adds though
---
Lol, I used to do the same on my lock back in the day.
---
lmao its literally like a 7 second cc
---
I think the same applies to blues at low level.  I think it's very greedy to need on those at a low level.
---
You posted this twice yesterday
---
You can‚Äôt ninja boes
---
Why is it bad to be selfish? Pugs can get fucked, If I wanted to play the game to get gear for other people to use, I'd do loot sale runs. No point wasting half an hour to get fucked by rng roll because I took a second mage to the group instead of bringing a hunter or something
---
Rogue then
---
Go to badlands. Just as crazy
---
Aw thats so cute!
---
You were 100% in the right, and frankly, I'd be the jerk if I failed to congratulate you.
---
Wait you either took the healers Trinket (it is an absolutely horrible farm because you need to run it so often to get even one to drop. And it would be best to have 2 of them).
---
Or you took the ring with + healing. Because that is the only ring with int that drops in DM West. Both are relatively clear healer items.
---
Dude threatening a 3 yr old. Lmao
---
PvE server?
---
Prot is garbage for dungeon tanking though. But that guy is wrong; I've had plenty of shadow priest or ret paladin healers and it the difference is minimal. Gear and playstyle is a much bigger factor than that 10% extra spirit or 5% extra critical heal chance. Even in raids hps or mana efficiency isn't really capped by spec.
---
Nope, winning your dream item is worth a hell of a lot more to many people for one... you have no idea how ecstatic this guy was, he'd wanted the sword for *fifteen years*. Getting it to drop is so much more satisfying that clicking "buyout".
---
What you're doing is trying to find a way to make as many items things you can have as possible. And honestly, congrats on missing the point of this game. I've been here and done all this before and 15 years later the imaginary pixels and big AH sales are *not* what I remember or enjoyed.
---
But you do you.. go ahead and turn everything in to "me me me" then justify it afterwards. I certainly won't be running with you, nor will the vast majority of people I encounter in the world.
---
I followed a female Tauren warrior named Kharen one day.
---
Wat
---
Not today but last night, but one of the guild officers in my guild has been farming HoJ for almost a month now (he said its been 80 runs according to his counter) so he hits me up and asks if I can heal for him for a lockout then do a lava jump run to smelt dark iron and so I'm like sure (he's litteraly one of the last in the guild to not have HoJ and and has been watching everyone else get it the past month). So I show up, we casually kill him, got it first drop. He was so ecstatic so we go to do the lava jump and I'm like oh let's just kill incind, he might drop my FR bracers I still need. Boom dropped and they're of the monkey (I'm a feral druid BTW)
---
The day before we did 3 DM jump runs and got the book of dragons slaying and 3 arcane crystals + herbs etc. Which paid the last chunk of my epic mount.
---
It's been a good few days. Grats on your ring, that one took me 25 runs (to get 4 for my group at the time)
---
How do you hearth into a hostile pvp zone?
---
Right, but in theory, EVERYONE should greed BOEs. Whoever can use it now, could have used it before the run as well but didn't want to spend their gold on it. In a sense the only difference is that they're saving the money they would have spent on it otherwise.
---
Yeah classic would actually be so much better with the premade group finder, being able to look for the dungeon you want and see exactly which groups are going, their comp and any extra info would be absolutely fantastic. Really makes dungeons a slog when it's that much tedium reading/writing the braindead /4 spam to find a group
---
I reported the guy after 3rd gank.   
---
Kinda let one slide, but after 3rd one got kinda upset.   
---
Perhaps a 24h ban will be a good lesson...
---
Why block the name after threatening to post it to Reddit?
---
Gotcha.  Skills do not evolve on their own - you need to locate a beast with the skill you want at the level you want, then acquire it and teach it to your other pet.
---
So for example if you want a higher level of Furious Howl, you'll want to check the list [here](https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/abilities.php#furioushowl) for which beast to tame for it.
---
"nothing reserved"
---
I am sorry that you are incapable of understand what a liquid item is, but please refrain from ruining others experience.
---
Shaman can kill her in 3 minutes.
---
Not even ninja logic. I go with whatever the group wants to do. If they want to let someone have it, then thats fine with me, if everyone wants to need then ill need to. As a rule of thumb i always roll last amd then roll accordingly. That being said, ive never found a group that wasnt everyone roll need, id have my spell damage flask recipe if i had, and i stand by that, if i really want the recipe, ill buy it.
---
My question for the people who are in the need before greed camp. If someone expresses interest in the drop, but everyone rolls need, would you pass the loot onto them? Even if its expensive, or would you keep it and sell it because you won the roll?
---
"This game is dying" - half of reddit.
---
Druid would probably be another option for you. Plus you have added role versatility which is nice since you likely only have time to play one character.
---
I think the best part is when people tell me an opinion is fact. That's the best part.
---
Based on what youre saying, Human female rogue. However I'm in a similar situation (I have about an hour and a half to play nightly, more on weekends) and I'm leveling a warrior, but that's because Ive always loved the playstyle. Itll be a while until I'm 60, but Im really enjoying it. If you like the rogue playstyle, itll probably be faster and less painful than going warrior.
---
&gt;strong doubt
---
Never mess with a...
---
#Tauren
---
Yeah, this is a great trick for bigger pulls. Warriors can do as well, with bandages. A Heavy Runecloth Bandage heals for 2k, which is 1k threat - on every mob in combat! Maxrange pulls usually let you get most of the healing off, especially on caster mobs.
---
You're tapping all the time in combat if you're using a pure drain tank build. You never ever want to be 100% health unless you're at 100% mana - that's wasting the dot and drain's effects. 
---
Enter combat, cast dots, tap, DH, tap, nightfall proc or DH, wand. leave combat with above 80% health and mana. If you're not taking too many hits and voidy keeps tanking OK, you can chain this 10-15 mobs in a row without stopping. Probably a little less on a pvp server to stay topped up, but if anyone chooses to try and gank you, you have the void shield, and just dot the shit out of them too. Dying on a pvp server is going to happen, but I've won many fights that someone passing by thought was going to be much easier. 
---
If you go into dark pact, you use a suc, but don't allow her to use any abilities, just autoattack. Then you just drain every mob while they helplessly beat on you, and instead of lifetapping you DP your mana back to full and go again.

Looks about the same as Grobb
---
I'm slower than the early rush crews, but gonna hit 60 soon-ish. I'm 55 now. After 52 it goes faster it seems.
---
I would wager a bet that he does this because he‚Äôs too scared or nervous to venture and attack on his own, seeing someone else already attacking acts as a safety mechanism. Smart kid.
---
Correct if you only play one way. In a game with many ways to play any given character. 
---
Aside from that, haven't you noticed that things are different in the Classic release than vanilla?
---
Yeah no. More lifetap = more dps = faster dungeon, that simple. Locks should be drinking along with the healer during mana breaks, though. If they just tap and afk, they're part of the problem.
---
lol cute removed the picture. lol
---
You can you think, don't but can.
---
What's a reasonable amount to tip may I ask? I usually tip 5-10s per lock-box depending on it's level. Often times whatever loot is in there is only worth about this. Definitely rude not to tip at all.
---
Dude your a legend haha my whole guild talks about you! üòÇ
---
I wish this actually was an unwritten rule. I‚Äôve been ganked on so many escort quests that I don‚Äôt even do them anymore.
---
Shes actually mad about people using dated memes. Huh
---
&lt;said the mage who uses spy addon and spams blizzard&gt;
---
A lot of people who could equip it as an upgrade will just AH it for mount money anyway, unless it's BiS.
---
Probably couldntve killed him if he was a meat eater...
---
There's a submit bug feature in the game......
---
The problem starts when the pug person spends gold on mats and since most things are reserved they end up paying to do a raid while getting nothing.
---
In Vanilla, my dad rolled a bald male Human Priest.. In Classic, he's rolled a grey haired female Human Mage and I keep doing a double take. Too use to his toon being bald.
---
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED
---
How have classic druid healers been holding up? I've only had a group with one druid healer (lvl 32 atm, going pretty slowly), but mained one during TBC. I played a mage during vanilla, so I never got to have the vanilla druid experience.
---
It depends what you want but you'll need to farm a lot of stacks to make any significant amount of gold
---
No worries, thanks again mate. :)
---
It's the same logic with all items tho, theres no "caliber". Ppl just dont want to deal with drama about loot worth less than 5 gold so they usually dont care as much. If someone wants this item so bad then he can go buy it right away on auction house, there's probably 20 of them. BoE items are currency, not "upgrades".
---
It's selfish and toxic.  You know it, I know it, the community knows it.  You can lie to yourself to justify the shitty practice in your head all you want though.  Keep on keeping on.
---
Stop right there before this gets patched.
---
Bump,
---
All the guides say a weapon with 3.0 or slower attack speed is needed to not clip aimed shot, but a lvl 40 quiver will give you a 13% attack speed boost so even a 3.3s weapon will autoshot at 2.87s so shouldn't it clip regardless?
---
I'm also confused about this..
---
How does vanish get resisted, probably the mob's autoattack going off on the same batch broke your vanish.
---
Were?
---
OP did it first
---
I heard someone say that you needed to let them mobs get a swing or two in before using vanish, seems to work for me but could be confirmation bias.
---
It is awful. Just logged on to level.
---
It‚Äôs ok you can be gay. We won‚Äôt judge.
---
Per his statement, he's level 53 this far in. If someone was power leveling him, they don't deserve to get paid.
---
when i roll need on a boe, i state beforehand i want to equip it or i say upfront im going to sell this, you should roll need too if you want a chance. not that hard
---
It‚Äôs chore time when I get home!
---
What are the odds of that happening two times in a row, several times within a couple of hours? Seems pretty low to me.
---
The best off hand is the one that the princess drops when you kill her, at least for holy priest.
---
There are better ways of making gold that don‚Äôt involve ninja‚Äôing
---
Lol I fear people into packs of mobs
---
Several, yeah like a half dozen.  Sources of spell haste are rare, not shadow resistance.
---
No they definitely got in some swings before I used vanish.
---
Aight, sympathy revoked I guess.
---
Have fun fighting mages as a warrior...?
---
It's as though it's his first time reading this sub or something
---
Who said anything about ninjaing? If you tell everyone to roll need regardless of what class can use the item, that isnt ninjaing
---
Do what you want to do and what you have fun doing.
---
theyre the same exact drs that exist in retail, the only difference is that the ccs are longer.
---
so 15sec fear/7sec/3sec
---
instead of 8sec/4sec/2sec in retail
---
or whatever the actual numbers are.
---
lighten up, francis
---
I had our tank for BRD tell me DURING the Angerforge fight that "oh yeah, the Ironfoe is on reserve, forgot to tell you".  [Screenshot for proof.](https://puu.sh/EvLDk/18de19403d.jpg)  I wasn't too worried because of it's abysmal drop rate, but like 'whoops, forgot to tell you about this one thing...'
---
Yes i wouldnt want a spriest healer as well. Thing is, the guy inviting OP didnt specify what role he needed so yeah shouldnt join groups that cant be clear with what they want
---
As a healer who has a harder time than a tank farming gold I'm not paying anything, if DPS want to do it (and a lot of them do) then they can give gold for the run.
---
So, you usually need several warlocks for all the different curses, but not for the DoT's. Also they can pump serious dps with shadow bolt spam especially if there is a Shadow Priest also in the raid. Geared Warlocks right now are having to slow dps to avoid stealing aggro.
---
You should see Org. It's paaacked. 
---
Joined a conga line too, had a blast.
---
I'm gonna have to agree, especially with transmog. The tall, thin female characters generally have the best options for transmog. Transmog on short characters is tough. Things end up looking a lot the same.
---
I remember my dad saying he named his tarantula "Tracey" cause it sucks the life out of everything.  Tracey is my mom's name and they're not together.
---
What a beautiful PvE server
---
Except with BoE items, the user could have had it at any point. The only difference is that now they don't have to spend the money...its the same greed
---
Then it's just buggy as all hell! we still get 19 energy ticks sometimes too and it fucks with rotations.
---
Yup I'm fine with the rock, paper scissors. I'm fine with hard counters. Not fine with an addon ruining the single advantage my class has.
---
I feel like if it happens twice, as a Hunter, I'd just pack it up and go somewhere else without getting my pet out again.
---
rolling a female cow in the first place is a terribull moosteak
---
i wasnt who got killed or has an issue with spy..but you clearly have some mental issues if you think that being downvoted is as bad as getting beaten
---
Lol dude said pro tip like people don‚Äôt know how to target jed. Also the drop rate being 20%+ is straight bullshit
---
As a warrior, I feel this.  Many people don't even tip for battle shout.  It's a substantial DPS increase!
---
^^^Not ^^^really ^^^a ^^^warrior.
---
I'm sitting in que on Incendius right now. They are pushing the Character Migrations it seems too. 
---
Honestly it's not a bad idea because layers are going away completely so they need to get the player bases where they should be on each realm. We are far enough away from launch that the servers are starting to stabilize.
---
Yeah, if you think the game is about getting max level. But the game is an RPG, and leveling is a large portion of the game for most players
---
&gt;I'm sitting in que on Incendius right now.
---
¬øQu√©?
---
Honestly he looks like he's already got pretty good physical control over what he's doing, even if he's not quite sure what "it" is. Crazy to see from a young age, congrats Dad!

Need your answer?
---
&gt;Or do I just continue to do what I‚Äôm doing? Because Im having a fuckin blast sneaking around
---
https://i.imgur.com/RG0BS1U.gif

This should not detour you. The grind for wintersabers is wayyyyyy longer. You get a ton of runecloth, youll end up with darn exalted.
---
This reminds me of the fire cape from Runescape being nicknamed the Pizza cape

Expertly said
---
&gt;Or do I just continue to do what I‚Äôm doing? Because Im having a fuckin blast sneaking around, even if it does feel a little slow
---
Keep doing whatever you enjoy, but don't be afraid to respec from time to time to try out different builds.
---
Kromcrush layers are gone too. Queue to get in.
---
I believe this is because: Burning Steppes is closer to IF, Dustwallow Marsh is closer to IF.
---
It isn‚Äôt a big deal really we just lose out on alot of dps
---
I think you have solved it.
---
how do you feel about demon hunters on live who can literally see trough stealth? makes ganking harder. but not impossible
---
Uh. You delay your Aimed Shot and skip Hawk Eye/Mortal Shots entirely, just to pick up gimmicks.
---
I'd advise against it. Roll 31/20/0 if you want to level your hunter as BM.
---
**Edit:** To clarify, by 'gimmicks' I mean talents that are either suboptimal or just not worth the talent points, no matter how you look at it.
---
**Spirit Bond (2/2)** is free health. Sounds great, right? Unless you do the math and convert it to HP/Sec. Just use bandages between fights.
---
**Endurance Training (5/5)** increases your pet's health. That's great. By 3% per talent point. That's not so great.
---
**Improved Mend Pet (1/2)** to dispel your pet. Remember when your pet caught the plague or whatever and you were looking for a priest? Me neither.
---
**Bestian Discipline (2/2)** boosts your pet's focus generation. That's fantastic! Until you actually take a closer look at your pet's damage composition. Spoiler alert, it's &gt;75% auto attacks. Still, this is the least shitty BM talent, which is why I usually end up putting that one filler point here (1/2).
---
That's definitely not what Org looks like on Heartseeker. );
---
clearly you have an issue.
---
Depends on what you‚Äôre looking for. I always recommend Incendius.
---
To all the people who said layers dont affect queue times: Grobbulus just lost a layer as well. Ironforge is insane right now. We have a queue time on a Tuesday night when we haven't had one for a while.
---
Agility for Dodge, i see.
---
At what point are you idiots gonna stop posting this garbage over and over again?
---
I really want BC classic but I also have this fear. Idk what the right thing to do is in this case. new content by blizzard... which has no guarantee of being good at all or proven content. ideally they would do TBC classic and then switch to a new content model but i doubt that. Most realistic thing I can see happening if they really go further with the concept of classic is doing up until WOTLK and then branching off, where cata was basically WOW2 now they have a chance to continue wow properly. But they would need to make a lot of changes to wotlk in order to not piss off a lot of people , like dungeon finder and maybe raid difficulties also (multiple difficulty options) and IDK if they are willing to do something like that. Its a tricky situation for blizzard to be in and I dont envy them. No matter what they do someone is gonna be pissed in the end.
---
Which would be better for a questing (usually solo) frost mage?
---
* Bloodwoven Mask of Intellect: 51 armor, +20 intellect
---
* Gemburst Circlet: 63 armor, +5 agility, +17 intellect, +9 stamina, +18 spirit
---
I know intellect is the most important stat of all those for mages, but not sure if the other bonuses make losing the extra 3 intellect worthwhile.
---
?? you're delusional all the way through this thread.
---
Oh im not conplaiming i thpught that shit was hilarious, i used to roll a troll  rogue with dragonstrike and blackout truncheon in tbc. Full on stunlock meme build for the sole purpose of ganking.
---
You do realize there are classes in this game and they have unique skills right? Maybe you should go back to retail? I'm sorry a rogue hurt your butt so bad.. Please do not be mean to pets, parents or on the rare chance significant others over this game. It is only a game.
---
Then your dps gave you a lot more time than mine did between 100% and 65%. I could technically sit there and hit 200k+ threat before 75% if no one was attacking, shield or no. Your metric means very, very little without looking at a timeframe. If you were like "i hit 60k threat in 60 seconds" that is something to measure against, but using the boss' health % as a unit of measurement accomplishes nothing unless the damage meters for our raids were identical (they clearly weren't).
---
Both sides say this about each other. 
---
Shocker - the player mindsets are pretty similar on each side.
---
"Joke's on you, I can't even read!"
---
Right click for one trinket slot, left click for the other.
---
BoEs are made to be dropped off trash mobs so that in the event you solo grind a piece or get a "useless" drop in a dungeon you have an option other than just vendoring it. Particularly if you solo ground a 100% useless for your class epic. 
---
The fact that it's BoE in a group setting doesn't override the Need vs Greed system just because you're a fucking jackass that uses asinine mental gymnastics to justify your petty greed you fucking dimwit
---
He didn't, everyone else had greeded. But I think the other guy was pissed because he felt the guy was just ninja'ing a non class item claiming "its an upgrade bro" when really its just he can vendor it for 3 gold or whatever it is.
---
Our raid leader had fury warriors soulstoned as our aggro dump.
---
the realm selection screen still says layered.  Maybe they just pushed more people into 1 layer to start testing how it'd handle?
---
But BoEs are LITERALLY just a money upgrade for the person who equips it too...they could have had it at any point, because they're for sale...the only difference is that now they're richer...
---
It is ninja looting by what Blizz has stated recently. I don't ever report people but this is some slimy shit and almost worth it. Fuck these greedy assholes.
---
He's getting entertainment - no time wasted
---
Where get??
---
If you're a warrior taking a ranged weapon upgrade away from a hunter yes it is. Reverse the roles and change it to a 2h sword. That weapon is a Stat stick to the warrior and a weapon upgrade for the hunter. People shit on hunters for the "lol hunter weapon" meme but think this shit is acceptable.
---
As a DPS you don't aim to get hit.
---
In a raid environment your job is to max damage. If you take hits you fucked up.
---
So a dps warrior wearing plate would be something like a hunter only equipping a melee weapon.
---
Wait.. Are you saying you retal tank Ony? ü§£ü§£
---
Hello, everyone streaming some more leveling tonight on Fairbanks let's get it! come say wutup
---
So you're a selfish asshole and projecting that onto everyone else, got it.
---
For the rest of us, 8g for our personal gain isn't worth as much as the value someone else could gain. Imagine that. 
---
One last attempt: BoEs have the same value to everyone. BoPs are more valuable to people that can use them. This is a relevant difference.
---
I think it's better than anything out of Ony/MC for an Orc Warrior tank.
---
it definitely was a thing before cata. might be TBC since that xpack added so much. I never played a mage but maybe check the mage tower where jaina is to see if there's a trainer there.

Wtf Hunters r so high? O_o
---
I noticed that too when trying to do the solo run today. It wasn't that hard to get to the boss but in that last boss area where you fight the king i was constantly infight and couldn't reg. I guess its the ghosts around who put you in fight, they can also kinda bug your feign death so they resist and then the boss resists too and turns around to hit you again
---
I have noticed some people take this game too serious. Especially the ones that never played Vanilla.  I would not get invited to RFC on my warrior because I was level 12...
---
Huh? But the amount of money you made during the grind easily pays for Darnassus Exalted.
---
These casters should make organizes groups to snipe Jed. Get a tank, a heal, 3 casters. Farm it out for all of them.
---
A 500g BoE is a effectetively a BiS drop for everyone, so why not let everyone need?
---
The same thing happened to me. A bunch of fellow Horde just pointed and laughed as I died trying to get to the flight master. Haha. Luckily the graveyard is right there.
---
what class do you play?
---
i just checked server lists and skeram is still listed as layered for me, did they put a layer back?
---
Didn‚Äôt you post this earlier too?
---
It hasn't been updated in a while though. Felt quite buggy last time I used it. I really enjoyed the fact that you could search for anything and get the location of it.
---
Has it been improved lately? I'm quite doubtful. As it's a fork of pfQuest.
---
&gt; mainly because there‚Äôs always gonna be another Tank/or DPS wanting to go that isn‚Äôt gonna pull the BS.
---
another dps sure, another tank not so sure. On my server every tank reserves stuff he needs and charge a fee on dungeons where he doesn't need anything.
---
His gear being all red is the icing on the cake.
---
Meanwhile.. my troll hunter with a bow.
---
As an enchanter, I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve applied some worthless to me enchantment on something I was wearing (for a skill up) and forget to change it back.
---
It's 30-45 mana (can't remember if it's 10 or 15 per point) and an infinitesimal amount of crit. You're going to be gaining more mana from that 18 spirit in the small gaps between casting than that, far more.
---
No, but when you have pugs with you, saying "no dps until X%, white hits only in p1" accomplishes nothing, so you just dual wield and pop a rage pot and go ham so you end up 40k threat higher than your raid in under 2 mins in p1.
---
&gt;*All BoE's represent gold/upgrades for everyone in the party because they're worth the same amount of gold for every player*
---
BoPs are worth the same amount of gold to every player as well so by your logic we should all be rolling need to sell the items for vendor value regardless of if we can use it or not...
---
Always ask the party lead what the loot rules are and snag a screenshot. If they go against the loot rules, it's a surefire suspension.
---
But why would you not sell the raw mats for 250g? Instead opting to craft a product to sell for 200g?
---
I wish I had the mental fortitude for this game. I'm lv 57 on my warrior and the grind is so miserable I decided to drop herbalism for mining so I could farm my own arcane crystals and transmute them myself... but I'm only 186 mining and THAT grind is burning me out. Outer Worlds should give me the break I need from this game.
---
Best post. Any guild would be lucky to have him

Join the Grob Mob, Horde. The server is so relaxed so long as you can put up with getting ganked now and again.
---
Ahh, Arugal on raid nights.  
---
  
---
It's a wonderful time to be a Horde player.
---
I'd take +9stam/+18 spirit over 3 int as a mage, especially if you are low on HP.
---
With one notable exception locked behind RNG.
---
Our Shadow Priest managed to get No. 1 Damage on 1 boss last raid.
---
Then they all go to raid and its a ghost town.
---
the days of enchanting intellect for pvp is upon us tho.
---
Yeah. I don't get many long sessions  week so O try and plan for them in advanced
---
Me too friend!
---
I tank as a paladin, and the threat from aura is a huge part of my threat - wouldn't run without it.
---
Sounds good, but my post is about pvp healing :)
---
&gt;*because if you can't equip it then the item is wasted*
---
Vendor value to get gold for an upgrade, the same logic you're using on BoEs:
---
Sell item =&gt; Get gold =&gt; Buy upgrade
---
Is there any way to turn off the ‚Äúdink‚Äù when a friend signs on? I have the option clearly turned off in interface options -&gt; social as well as the bnet launcher. I don‚Äôt have any addons that deal with chat. It only makes the sound when someone signs on, not off. Although I get a message someone signs off. 
---
The noise is really annoying.
---
To be fair, it's probably a lot tougher on a warrior than a mage... I don't think I could ever play that class
---
Hahah making of tipsout really original fun content that we are not completely tired off
---
PILAV 2 months late on this one.
---
Tho tbh after watching this shit I wouldn't be able to last one week raiding in this guild even if I was paid.
---
Also holy shit pilav is actually the opposite of fun I don't know what to cringe at, tips out raidleading or pilavs commentary.
---
Idk man, when I levelled my 60 on PvP server I promised myself to attack anyone and everyone I could within 5 levels, whether it's 1 on 1, 1 on X, whatever, and I did. It was not nearly as fast levelling as my 60s on PVE server but it was arguably more fun. I couldn't help but noticing that Alliance players on my server (Benediction) would literally never make the first attack unless they had numbers. I can count on my hand the number of times I got opened on one vs. one, but I definitely died a lot one vs x.
---
Because you can't enforce that
---
Healers somehow always manage to heal me right after I start bandaging so that the bandage and CD are completely wasted.
---
That begs the question... do you need a riding skill for baron rivendare's mount?

Yeah about those HoTs.. if your raid is serious then you don't really use them apart from maybe on the tank. Losing world buffs cause of HoTs (thanks to the buff cap) isn't great

Yeah, its worth it.
---
Before you go start doing serious dungeoning/raiding then definitely 9 stamina/18 spirit is worth more than 3 intellect.

Lol you farmed 250g worth of mats. Instead of selling it all for 250g, u craft it into a product to sell for 200g?

You are not prepared!

Missed door to strat living inside the instance

Mounting a thick brown pole.

i have to admit that the head thing with several guilds grouping to then go raid on a set day is pretty bad ass. glad im part of that shit.

Hillsbrad and Arathi are brutal for alliance on Grobbulus

It's a video game. People can grow up. If you need something roll need. If you dont, roll greed. It's simple

I thought in BC you don't need soul stones for BG and arena prep? Or was that a private server only thing?

I see this being brought up over and over but I've yet to see it happen myself, a boe epic shield even dropped in maraudon and noone was upset when the tank needed and equipped it.
---
I plan to do more dungeons when I respec so I'll try and focus only on quests that involve dungeons.
---
Ok retard
---
Is it an epic mount or 60% speed mount? and do you have to pay gold to buy it or you get it for free after hitting exalted?
---

Not a LW but leveling skinning to 300 whilst leveling. Kept everything and decided to cash it all in last week. Wasn't nearly as profitable as I had been led to believe (or chose to believe at the start) but I got  enough coin out of it to power lvl Engineering to max and buy a few cheeky QOL items here and there.
---
Only the outer ones, you kill the two before Eranikus
---
It's not about when you did the raid. It's a set timer independent of anything you do.
---
E.g. If Ony starts Monday/ends Friday, and you do it on thursday, its still going to reset come Friday. 
---
[https://www.onyxiareset.com/](https://www.onyxiareset.com/)
---
Looks like it cleared on monday.
---
That's the spirit.
---
Is that what these scrubs are doing now? Reserving things? LMFAO
---
It is an epic mount. Unfortunately, you still have to pay 900g to actually get it.
---
I got mine drop from aq40 openig event. Drop off the anubisath raid mobs that spawned around silithus
---
That's what I said?
---
Really good boots. There are similar ones that drop from a rare in BRD but they lack agility and have less Stamina.
---
pserver has wrong stats for spell scaling &amp; boss resistances. don't base your knowledge on erroneous sources.
---
Warlocks on pservers had a much higher resist rate as a result and needed more spell hit gear to compensate, when they could be stacking spell crit to get the +20% shadow debuff from crits.
---
Hmmm my memory is shot, I don't remember it. I'll check tonight but I just did a search and people were saying it was added in TBC. So I'm guessing not in classic. Hearthstone it is for now then..
---
What slippery slope? The selfish argument of *"I don't care if you can equip it, I want a chance at the gold..."* can easily be applied to BoPs in the same fashion people are apply that mentality to BoEs in this thread:
---
*"Oh, Dal'rend's is an upgrade for you? Too bad, everyone roll need for a shot at the 5g..."*
---
Thats literally what the need button is for.
---
One of my favorite things in retail was when I leveled a new warlock in Legion.
---
Every time ST popped up I took the opportunity to swap to the trait that gives infinite corruption duration since MC'd players counted as NPCs for the purpose of effects like that.
---
Oh man the salt when nobody in the party had dispel magic and they chose to do that boss first... beautiful.
---
please note all his gear is broken. get that boy a blacksmith!
---
You must be running with some complete dogshit mages, no way you should be top dps consistently.
---
&gt; You‚Äôre acting like people auto detect you in stealth
---
That's literally what it does... wtf
---
Damn dude. Watching you rage in all of your comments. Youre super tense. Tone it down a bit and people might take you serious.
---
I just ask "is it ok if I need those?" before needing any BoE, even greens,  just to be safe
---
Hunters start out strong and then get worse and worse and worse.
---
They are still above casters until around ZG though.
---
In case he goes *Oom* and eveyone dies and he have to finish off the boss with crit wands while dodging boss attacks.
---
You never know what could happen in a raid. You can never be too prepared.
---
No you are.
---
See, when I did the quest about a month ago I had forgotten the part about the planks and got teleported up there facing away from them. So I naturally just ran straight ahead and jumped down.
---
It was a long way from the graveyard :&lt;
---
No +100 hp is better.
---
If someone in the group can use a piece of gear then they should have rights to it. 
---
Ya everyone needs gold, but there‚Äôs tons of ways of making it. Not as many ways of obtaining gear anyway.
---
But I do feel if someone genuinely would use a piece of gear that everyone ends up needing on, in my mind that‚Äôs a gang bang ninja right there.
---
Your first paragraph just explains things that could go wrong, but don‚Äôt. Lol. This isn‚Äôt a hypothetical situation. You don‚Äôt play around 20 raid members disconnecting. You don‚Äôt play around your healers playing badly at this level. You play around the strategy you‚Äôve prepared for the encounter. 
---
It isn‚Äôt about the frost blast‚Äôs damage and the fact that you bring up the damage is laughable. The ability would function the exact same in the fight if the damage were removed entirely. It‚Äôs about potentially stunning your entire melee or just moving one person out that would‚Äôve probably had to slow down eventually anyway to avoid passing the OT who isn‚Äôt getting the same rage gen as the MT and is consequently generating less threat. You don‚Äôt play around hoping rng blesses you and the boss doesn‚Äôt target your melee. 
---
As for your Ragnaros comparison, look at the rosters from both ragnaros and KT. Hint: Nihilum wasn‚Äôt a serious guild, nor a contender for WF until AQ. In fact, no EU guilds were. Next, look at the patch their ragnaros kill vods are on. It‚Äôs like you know that you‚Äôre comparing apples to oranges and expecting everyone else to just blindly agree. For someone so arrogant and quick to insult someone‚Äôs credibility, you seem to know very little about the vanilla bleeding edge raiding scene.
---
Horde are the after-thought and unfinished faction, this has been known since 2004
---
Yeah dude. Playing a female char is completely fine but roleplaying as one is fucking weird
---
If you‚Äôve had him for 30 levels, he probably had it when you tamed him. Claw 3 is a ~20s level skill.
---
You can cast instant cast spells while someone is MCd.  He could have casted a renew or something while they were mcd.  When there is a horde being chill with me like waiting on their group to get to strat I‚Äôll Mc and buff with fort
---
never said I was top dps consistently... said I was either on par with mages or ahead of them depending on crit luck frankly
---
&gt; So you're a selfish asshole and projecting that onto everyone else, got it.
---
Funny how when I use your argument I'm a selfish asshole.
---
&gt; For the rest of us, 8g for our personal gain isn't worth as much as the value someone else could gain. Imagine that. 
---
And for me, 800g isn't worth it. Yet *I'm* the selfish asshole. Again, interesting.
---
&gt; One last attempt: BoEs have the same value to everyone. BoPs are more valuable to people that can use them. This is a relevant difference.
---
And if you'd ever seen someone get that amazing epic world drop they really want, BoE or not, you wouldn't say this.
---
Yeah okay blizzard I get it I‚Äôm celibate
---
Says the man siding with a primate.
---
did you people miss the "roleplaying" part of the title?
---
thanks but this is historical info, not what was requested
---
You can kill rival farmers more easily.
---
look at that the person who has not played on a rp server has not seen anyone rp
---
woops sry wont do it again
---
I'm not planning to delete them.  I just have about 700g saved up for my epic mount, and when I realized that AH prices are very cheap for leveling gear, I didn't hesitate to tweak out an alt and decide to make them my main.
---
If it's red it's dead
---
Omg i found this too. They are so bugged. I‚Äôm a mage and they chased after me from just outside BRD instance portal to Morgan‚Äôs vigil which is like a good 10 minute run. I didn‚Äôt attack them. I just blinked away, used ice barrier etc so it wasn‚Äôt because I was hitting them. 
---
It was pretty funny, lots of players I passed were really confused what was happening and I was expecting that once I reached Morgan‚Äôs vigil some npc guards would kill them for me or something. Nope. I died.
---
&gt; pserver has wrong stats for spell scaling &amp; boss resistances. don't base your knowledge on erroneous sources. 
---
I'd like a source on that.
---
&gt; erroneous sources. 
---
I'm not saying pservers are 100% accurate, I am saying that comparing with pservers is MORE accurate, than comparing to back in vanilla. Why? Because vanilla had constant patch changes it didn't use 1.12 throughout the entire game, and people played/geared incredibly sub optimal meaning that whoever tops dps is basically just whoever happened to randomly gear the best. You cannot use vanilla for this shit. How many fury warriors did you see top dps in MC? Oh yeah, none. Private servers are the best estimates for now.
---
1/3 imp shield block and LS, the rest of the points are flexible, personally i take (took? will take? i played a war in vanilla, working on lvling a war now my mage is 60) iron will and only 1 point into imp revenge, but you certainly can go 3/3 imp revenge and only 3/5 iron will
---
Nah the shoulders are damage and healing from spells and effects. But yes to the rest, they won't work with bloodthirsty.
---
You wanna reword that in such a way it actually makes sense?
---
UPDATE: just got a response from them asking for a picture of my face next to my ID, sent over waiting on the next reply
---
Lol, i was so confused
---
By that logic, isn't rolling on BOPs when there's a better purchasable BOE just someone saving money and not buying the BOE before the run as well? So you wanna need on all of those as well so you can sell them?
---
Gorishi Grub. Is it in classic &amp; can you tame it?
---
They artifically capped the servers trying to force people to transfer. This is to make up for Blizzard's own initial error when they lowballed the server count to try to save a dime.
---
Mages and locks slacking?
---
As a rogue http://imgur.com/gallery/p67dHec that is a challenge I will always take
---
Yeah I‚Äôm kinda regretting rolling a PvP server now. I would love it if I planned on playing Ret because I could defend myself better and kill more efficiently. I just want to have a chance by myself 1v1, but I went paladin to heal in PvE which means I need a dps partner always in PvP. No dual spec means I‚Äôm fucked. Wasn‚Äôt too bad when leveling, but the respec at 60 just fucked my talents into oblivion for dueling. 
---
The people that gloat that PvE is for pussies are people who play the classes that are heavily imbalanced to have an advantage in PvP.
---
They don‚Äôt actually see you though, they just know you‚Äôre around. This by no means makes rogues unplayable, and certainly doesn‚Äôt mean you should reroll lol.
---
My farmer alt is going to be a mage. My warrior is constantly broke and miserable lol.
---
I like healing with him. I did Strat last night no problem and Ubrs/BRD are no issue. I think I just worry that I won‚Äôt have much fun once BGs come around. I want to be a more feared class
---
Had an Aussie rogue called Issy that would fall of that bridge so many times.  Paying more attention to trolling on the forums or so he said.
---
LOL "keep following guildies and do not answer"
---
My post was just addressing your hypothetical, but I'll dive into how I feel about the topic in general I guess.
---
The money that can be made from one valuable BoE can be transformed into an item of equivalent value for whoever wins it. However, a BoP item doesn't hold equivalent value for everyone in the group, hence why they wouldn't be rolled off among the entire group unless no one wants it. 
---
The money is especially important in a game like Classic, where gold is a significant part of progressing your character. For example, having a 100% speed mount is a significant advantage, one that could help you earn money much more quickly to simply buy your BiS items after the fact. 
---
(Sidenote: if the increase in power from the BoE is marginal enough, the value add by equipping it could be less than simply selling it and using the gold for something else.)
---
Note that I wouldn't really argue in favor of going all need on items that aren't relatively valuable. There's no real point to taking away an upgrade from someone to make 10g of profit, you probably would see that level of variance in how much people make from simply looting trash and greens in any given run, but 100g+ is very significant.
---
Outside of the item value argument, all need is also a defense against ninjas taking high value items. Even if you've communicated your intentions, if the item is worth enough someone could just need on it anyway. It's simply much safer to roll this way, even if you personally don't find it to be as fair.
---
Ultimately, you can make the decision to set up your loot rules however you want at the start of the dungeon, so if you feel differently about this you can just communicate that to the group before you start.
---
I thought I was young when I started playing at eight. He's going to grow up with a special love for the game just like I did. This is so pure
---
I honestly don't understand the crafting fee lol, seems greedy to me. I guess it is standard practice though.
---
Depends on case by case basis.
---
Usually lockpicking is without a fee but usually a  30s-2g tip based on how many boxes and what lvl etc.
---
For crafted pieces if there's no special recipe then 20s-2g for their time(based on your level/gold), and for anything with a somewhat rare recipe there's usually a fixed fee that the crafters asks for.
---
Dam son, thats one sexy helm
---
I think you missed my point entirely.
---
Had this happen 5 times now as a shaman.  
---
Doesn't matter if anybody is inside or outside the room.  
---
Doesn't matter if the totems are put in the square the boss is standing on or elsewhere.  
---
After the first wipe on Ambassador Flamelash, it doesn't happen anymore for that run.
---
I'm yet to try not using the totems entirely.
---
And no, it's not somebody pulling the mobs ffs
---
&gt;Funny how when I use your argument
---
Except that you twist it into a situation where items do not have a symmetrical value (BoP where one person can wield it). This is a strawman, and I'm kinda done replying to someone who's obviously arguing in bad faith.
---
What long fight?
---
&gt;*If the vegetarian were honest*
---
What does this have to do with honesty?
---
Fairness would be you selling the apple and giving your friend 50 cents.
---
Cooperation would be you and your friend coming to an agreement that since you enjoy apples and they don't, you get the apple. The idea being that if you happen upon a piece of meat later, they would get it since you don't like meat.
---
Why waste the time on the reroll
---
I think you need to reread the comment you‚Äôre replying to.
---
And I'm supposed to show the image of this bug how
---
Also as a lock, I always will give the healer a minimum of 5 waters and a soulstone on cool down once the party for a dungeon is formed
---
Um for melee / nameplate range(20yards) threatplates has icons for just you above the mob which I like
---
Eh as a Priest we have runflats with things like Inner Focus, Power Infusion for more healing, and even Second Wind. Even when we pull another pack or two, I can usually handle things if the tank can keep them off me.
---
It‚Äôs tricky. I usually don‚Äôt mind tipping, and probably tend to overtip just because I have no idea what I should be giving someone. I don‚Äôt think anyone should be demanding a tip. At that point, call it a fee. The whole ‚Äúyour mats + tip‚Äù makes no sense to me. The whole idea is we‚Äôre giving you a little extra as a thank you. All you‚Äôre doing is pressing a couple buttons for 45 seconds max. If you‚Äôre not willing to just help, don‚Äôt advertise it.
---
When classic was in beta, that was all the discussion on differences between pservers vs blizzard. Turns out pservers overtuned many boss stats and resist. I don't have time atm to chase down those threads.
---
But the result is that it punishes classes that lack hit % in their talent trees, and rewards Mages in particular that can get -resist and hit %.
---
That's just reserving without calling it reserving.  Only you've reduced the pool of potential groupmates.
---
I didn't exaggerate, i just shared my experience. Its been killing my motivation to play lol
---
It's a game, so it's all time wasted lol
---
&gt; warrior is already pulling the next group before my mana filled 
---
This is great and not a problem. It means the tank has more time time to build up threat. DPS meters make people toxic.
---
Best thing I‚Äôve seen all day! Set him up with a few buttons to mash on so he can get a better feel for the game
---
Been waiting a week for LF 1 dps ULDA. Didn't know that it was possible.
---
Because why would he spend 2k gold to get blacksmithing to 300 and then use a 1.5k recipe to craft it for free?
---
WOTLK was the pinnacle of WOW (Anyone who tells you otherwise is wrong)
---
WOTLK saw the highest subs for this game ever (Hovering around 13mil concurrent) and tapered off after that.
---
Also, WOTLK has the best content as well
---
There was a gnome mage the other day in WPL who just thought they were ok to AoE grind@Dalson's. No sir. I counterspelled his Blizz and then let him waste Block when the mobs caught him. He Nova's they mobs to run away and I swoop in with a Nova of my own. Take that full repair death, good day. Had a rogue whisper me about my artistry even.
---
Selfishness is a bit more than that. It‚Äòs being concerned with oneself ‚Äûexcessively‚Äú or ‚Äûexclusively‚Äú.
---

---
If you can see someone in stealth, you can attack them.
---
We just had to stealth run that the other night to get it for a rogue.  You might be able to find 3 rogues who will sell it to you.
---
Usually cheaper on Horde due to having ease of access.
---
How does he know which menu option is "follow"?  Trial and error?
---
Well the aggir part is not really relevant, as your healaggro will never be relevant for the main tanked target (which is the only target you gain damage aggri on) and in the szenariowe are talking about you are healing so little that if you or our tank don't completely fuck up there is no chance in hell you ever get aggro.
---
Secondly this is only relevant for mana efficient damage options. And if you are playing with a mage (which is likely as it is most populat) that has to drink it doesn't matter that much if you drink yourself, or while the next fight starts as, as defined in the situation we are talking about you will do nothing for the next 30ish seconds anyways. 
---
This is more relevant for classes like druid who can catform at the start of the battle before needing to heal, or other classes that have some for of efficient damage in dungeons where getting close doesn't risj your life.
---
This is espeicalltly true in lower levels, as the talent trees don't really matter and the damage and specific equap doesn't make your mana per damage that much worse than other classes.  
---
(Or especially if you are healing with a damage spec.)
---
Obviously it is always bad when you do it so much that your drinking slows down the group but obviously that is too much then.
---
You can't say "every little piece of damage is always bad" none of your arguments is universal like that and the reality is more complex. But yes only do damage if you know what you are doing and or the group pretty much needs no heal and all you do is fastfood at the end of an encounter.
---
I want a woman to touch me one day. In the meantime I'll settle for female wow toons.
---
You ever seen more than 1? :P
---
You're reachy af, anyone that doesn't pander to you gets accused of beating their pets and partners. Grow up.
---
the difference is BoE's have the same value for every player, and if a player loses a roll they can always buy the item off the AH. BoP's have a much greater value to players who can use them (assuming it's an upgrade), and if a player loses a roll they have to continue grinding out the item.
---
If you can see them, you can target them, and if you can target them, you can attack them.  Slam TAB and your attack of choice.
---
You used to be able to do: `/targetnearestenemy` as a macro command, so I'd pair it with sap:
---
/targetnearestenemy 
---
/cast sap
---
Then you just spam it while hunting rogues.  As it is now, I believe you can only use TAB for that (*nearest*, you can still do /targetenemy).
---
PINK TEXT
---
Even if their name doesn't appear over their head? Wellp I feel dumb now if so. All this time I've just let them get the first jump because I thought I couldn't attack anyway.
---
With an E, not a Y!
---
lol why
---
ARE YOU FUCKING SORRY?
---
In current gear, rogues are the second best users of their BiS gear.  You denying and kicking fury warriors from the guild for it is dumb when the only people being greedy and complaining are the rogues.
---
Alliance started it, Horde finished it.
---
It's gonna get a lot worse when honor comes out.
---
Saw a druid named Cenarius with like 3 special characters. Special characters make more than upset, as well as bad names.
---
Especially names like "Imrlyhighlol" "Chronicmage" "weedsoul"
---
/s?  
---
3 year old is speaking very well.  Good motor skills.  Good morals wanting to help his friends.  Yep so much neglect present.
---
Lol healthy balanced population... good one.
---
Have better reaction time. When you are in stealth and hear the sound, instantly press tab(or what ever ur target button is) and cheap shot. The other rogue was probably prepared or just good reaction time.
---
Wait lol, so u just farmed 250g worth of mats (which I‚Äôm assuming takes a considerable amount of time and effort) Instead of spending some more time to sell those mats for 250g, you opt to craft a product with it and sell it for 200g? Keep it up mate, we need more people like you to make profits on.
---
This was an actual classic bug back in the day. Glad to see it still around.

&gt;*The fantasy of an RPG comes largely from imagining your character is you, right?*

For lockpick service, I'd suggest 25s-50s per 75 points, per lock.

I agree. I‚Äôm a childhood professionalist and the poor kids eyes aren‚Äôt fully developed yet he is allowed to play computer games. This is borderline child abuse
---
I disagree, retail have tons of pug clearing heroic contents which are orders of magnitude harder than MC.

And I recall BWL not being that much harder back in vanilla. Even normal retail raids will be harder than BWL

I will say I‚Äôm not surprised it‚Äôs happening in Cath because it attracts the spellcleave dipshits. I think the closest I‚Äôve come to actual toxic players was Cath.

I mean, the old saying is *MMORPG = Many Men Online Role-Playing Girls*...
---
Our guild MT is Fury and we successfully took down Ony with 22 people.   
---
At least three of our guild mages are PoM Pyro spec and their strongest spells are mostly useless in all of the endgame content.   
---
We have two Shadow Priests and a Bookmin in MC.  
---
The people telling you that your spec/class/race/build/etc isn't right are tryhard morons that don't understand that content at this stage of the game is beyond trivial and doesn't even remotely require minmaxxing.
---
Dungeons are even easier, you can literally go in any dungeon with level 58 characters that have spent 0 talent points and still clear it easily. Just add the people that flame you for DPS or build to your ignore list, they're not worth your time.
---
.
---
Probably your most intelligent comment so far.
---
That isnt how aggro works. Most mobs will reset after running a certain distance from the spot they aggro'd onto you. This can vary from mob to mob, and some dont reset
---
Me and my buddy ran spriest/rdruid in 5man dungeons leveling up. We did it so we could have a res handy since he wanted to heal on rdruid. Turns out this pair works amazingly well, spriests healing with vampiric embrace + rdruids aoe healing basically let us grab 3 other dps if there were no tanks available. It really opened up how different variations work, we had enhance shammy tanks, rogue stunlocking + tanking and me as an spriest tanking if needed. Sometimes having 3 people each taking a mob wasn't even a problem, we could just heal our way through everything. So rdruids are now my favorite healers to roll with.
---

you're so greedy you've actually convinced yourself you need other people's gear
---
Who?  I mean really, who?  There's probably 0 people total on my server who if they said don't group with so and so because they're a caster who rolled need on a caster ring that was not truly optimal for their class would lead to me putting that caster on ignore.  I'd probably just lol in chat and take another swig of my beer irl before moving on.
---
Not really,
---
I wouldn't have purchased the leather gloves that drop in RFK,  I did however need them when they did drop because they were an upgrade.  If someone needs them and they are actually going to wear them then they need them.  You might have a point with end game BiS slot BOE drops, or super rare BOE epics.. but for the majority of them? Meh its not the way i choose to play.
---
Just because i could buy them doesn't make them any  more or less of an upgrade, I guess it call comes down to if you play the game to make friends or you play the game to get  loot.
---
I'm sitting in a queue for 34 minutes to play Kromcrush right now =(  Not sure what happened, I haven't had a queue for weeks. Maybe they took a layer off?
---
So?
---
I mean yes but for example when I'm running a UBRS Jed farm run with 3-man someone else can tag along for any of the other loot (looking at you Truestrike Shoulders/Fire res back/Str, crit, fire res neck) and get those items. We just end up vendoring them and another person or two means quicker runs and more potential Jeds before lock out.
---
That's just how the threat works. If a tank gets stunned, all of the mobs go to the next Target with the highest threat.
---
Lmao
---
Did they just remove the layers today? I haven't had a Q in like 3 weeks on incendius and i just tried to log in and had one
---
To be honest, I haven‚Äôt seen too much negative sentiment towards reserves on this sub. What seems to piss people off most often is the reserves not being announced up front and rather right before the boss or half-way through the instance in order to make them feel like they might as well stay. Reserves are perfectly fine as long as they‚Äôre announced in the group formation. Even then, some people are going to be assholes about that, but oh well. Like many others have said, those people can always go and find another group.

I mean, if they got the recipe during a full guild run, a lot of the gold, lets say at least 50%, will instantly go to the guildbank, on bigger realms the craft is usually around 250 gold or less and it's not as if 10 warriors per hour approach you since the mats itself cost over 1K. So the one crafting it probably makes a couple of hundred gold per day from it at best, likely even less on big servers where a lot of people have the plans. Sure, it's passive gold that you get from being completely AFK in a city, but I believe you would make more gold for yourself (not the guild) just doing DM jump runs with a miner and a herbalist.
---
Lmao you‚Äôre using his circular logic that doesn‚Äôt make sense. No one is daggers until the BoS dagger drops. Not rolling on gear doesn‚Äôt mean shit. Stop defending him.
---
They could have points in master of deception (increased stealth) and heightened senses (increased detection)
---
But it's the SAME gold greed for the equipper, don't you understand? It's not gold vs item, as it would be with BoP. Its gold vs gold. Imagine a 200g BoE. Its available to buy all The time, the only difference between before the run and after it drops is that now the equipper is 200g richer than they would have been. The EXACT same 200g richer that anyone else in the run would be as well.
---
Put another way: imagine two guilded tanks. Tank A spends 200g on a necessary upgrade to help the guild progress. Tank B doesnt want to spend the gold on the same upgrade. Later on in a run, that item drops. Tank B is now entitled to it, and Tank A is shit out of luck on the money he had to spend? Which one is the "greedy" one?
---
This shouldn't happen pre T3.
---
Has anyone had issues with emberstrife? When I took control and tried to use the ability it said it has a 3 hr cool down
---
That‚Äôs awesome! Great video. It took me only 4 years to get jealous of someone else‚Äôs kid. My daughter is getting extra screen time this week!
---
How ridiculous...they are sold/traded for a reason...cause they are upgrades. You need them, they are just being greedy...so you both rolled correctly
---
don't you also deal much more single target dps with arcane instability and arcane power?
---
You should be spamming tab and sap like a mad man when you are looking for a rogue while in stealth.
---
Thanks! He always wants to play with me. So I take him with me every time I play. I was surprised how fast he picked it up.
---
Yeah it probably feels shitty for Horde too lol
---
Currently sitting in my first ever 30 min queue for Grob what is going on.
---
&gt; That isnt how aggro works. Most mobs will reset after running a certain distance from the spot they aggro'd onto you. This can vary from mob to mob, and some dont reset
---
You are wrong. 
---
Only special mobs like Kazaak have restrictions like this, otherwise you can kite anything from anywhere as long as there is a direct connection with no weird terrain. Someone kited Teremus to SW just yesterday on my server. 
---
Check the NPC's health between frames, it drops which shows that OP was using attacks to re-aggro. Most likely low level spells. He should have poly'd them before taking the screenshot to make it more believable. 
---
I've spent hours kiting various elites from region to region, as far as I know only a handful that are intentionally unkitable have the restrictions you've described.
---
I couldn‚Äôt agree more with your stance on this. You were 100% right and more people should see it this way too. Anytime I start a group for anything I make it clear to all that if anything drops that you need, then roll need and anyone who is not ok with that can leave.
---
I mean this is still evidence a lot less people are playing now than release. One layer wouldn't have been possible.
---
Shouldnt the server hold the same amount of people whether there is 1 layer or 10? I thought layers just spaced people out more
---
They do it to throw off Auctioneer/Tsm algorithms.
---
There also also a few Jokeresque folks who just want to see the world burn.
---
I was lagging, thought i was about to dc
---
He's not using the follow feature.  You can see him following his friend and helping his friend hit things.
---
Yeah I know. You're being stupid.
---
This is what I worry about when my 8 year old plays...spam filter and mature language filter only do so much..and he has no idea how the game really works, but he absolutely loves to play. Exploring Azeroth is his favorite!
---
"If you don't start answering us..."
---
&gt; Kappa
---
No ty.
---
Yes.. I told him where to click a few times. He understands letters just not words.I then realized how silly I was and made a macro so he can just click it and follow me. But by the time I realized that he already learned where the follow button was located and started following everyone.
---
Kromcrush suddenly had a queue, so I assumed it fell as well.
---
You try to pool rage on whelps.
---
\#nochanges &lt;3
---
Reserving is fine.. it‚Äôs a very open ended way to play the game and that‚Äôs good. 
---
If the reserve is small like ‚Äúfirst righteous orb for tank‚Äù then you‚Äôd probably still get people that don‚Äôt mind it, since at least you get to run.
---
If the reserve is too big, like ‚Äúhoj reserved need tank and heals‚Äù then yeah good luck shouting for 2 hours and being ridiculed by everyone.
---
People will always weigh the pros and cons of like is it better to just get a run or if they‚Äôre willing to wait longer for specific classes.
---
https://youtu.be/NSl894txozY?t=68
---
clicks "friend", right-clicks portrait, selects follow
---
Yeah I believe the last layer was removed today.
---
The quest and the rewards are not needed for anything.
---
It's just a normal standalone quest that happen to be Warlock specific. Can safely skip it.
---
No, it was 1 out of the 4 others players. So he was grouped with one ape.
---
I won't join a group if they have anything reserved. Fuck you l, roll like everyone else.
---
I think he's pretty advanced but that's probably just because I'm his dad and like would like to think that.
---
I mean, he knows to click both mouse buttons to move and the right mouse button to attack.  I'm not trying to insult the kid, but this isn't hard stuff.
---
Tipping someone to open a lockbox i will do but only if they don't ask for a tip before hand,
---
If i ask for them to ope na box and they are happy to do it without asking for a tip, i usually tip a decent amount.
---
If they ask for tip before or during then they have just lost the sale

---
This means someone has mind-controlled him before you to do the quest, then they let him live so the cooldown kept going. The ability itself has like a 4-5hr cooldown, so it was likely an hour from when you attempted it. 
---
Kill him, wait 10-15 minutes for the respawn and try again. This will create a 'new' Emberstrife with the ability off its cooldown.
---
LMAO the all red gear and /following the guy while punching the enemies. I love it. Those people he's helping are probably so confused.
---
This intrigues me. I only see when it works from others on here. How many times does it not work though? I'd like to see someone really test this.
---
You're absolutely right. Getting a computer to recognise one object is not hard nowadays. Getting it to recognise a whole *class* of objects is an entirely different matter.
---
A very advanced WoW bot is much harder to make than a drone. And an autonomous combat drone is vastly much harder to make than both.
---
Wait theres an addon that alerts you to a stealthed target? 10/10 thanks for letting me know, fk those ganking rouges
---
i plan to hit 60 by the weekend...
---
I've mained two classes, paladin tank and hunter.  Hunter is 100% in the wrong.
---
Hunter should be pulling with 1 arrow, if at all.  LOS into your consecration.  Stand there next to you until you've got all the mobs on you.  Back up and multishot.  If that pulls, tell him to kill skull first before using multishot.
---
Regardless, he's a hunter.  He should be fully capable of feigning death to drop aggro.  It's a 30s cooldown ffs.
---
For yourself, you can try using max rank consecrate on the first pull then rank 1 afterwards, also try out Wizard's Oil if that is available, can't check if that is in classic.  Use Ret aura and get a shield spike.  Judgement on current DPS target for more threat.
---
Myzrael?
---
yes
---
Druids are good enough in raids and give a nice buff, but don't ever expect to top meters in raids. Healer druids also kinda screw eachother if there's more than one because of how HoTs work. But even with that taken in consideration, for anything aside from a speed clearing guild, there's really no reason to deny a druid a raidspot.
---
Really disappointing only one of you retards responded
---
you realise anyone can read your past comments right?
---
Dude, your logic and thought process is beyond fucked, seriously just shut the fuck up. It's only the "same" in your warped ass mind that relies on a shit load of mental gymnastics to justify your idiocy. Your "example" is equally as fucked since it's no different than person A getting a boss drop in 1 run versus person B getting it in 50 runs, neither one is more "greedy" they simply got to the same conclusion at a different rate that you're trying to spin into a fucking sob story for your twisted ass "logic"
---
hot
---
Better than most casual players
---
These aren't even twink items lmao. The whole point of roll etiquette on rare BoEs is that the big spike in gold from selling outweighs the use someone would get from using them normally. Those wouldn't sell for much. That guy was dumb.
---
"what advantages are you entitled to gain from add ons?"

So, lol was confused I

Probably written by a reddit bot.
---
I'm max cooking/fishing and I often TRY to sell the high end stuff like grilled squid, nightfin soup etc, but I find at least half the time my auctions are expiring. Not enough people buying them and also keep getting undercut by the same select few people also trying to sell them. In the end everyone is selling them for scraps and it becomes not worth my time fishing them.
---
Take Stonescale Eel for example. Lots of forums online with people saying they sell for them 1g ea or more, yet (on my server anyway) people are flogging them for a measly 9s. Like wtf? The effort to lvl your fishing, go to the right areas and time of day to get them, spend hours of gameplay fishing for them, and you then sell them for 9s? What a waste...
---
For now I'm just stockpiling everything for when the market matures.
---
&gt; There are some weird mentalities being spread around the community lately that I never experienced back in Vanilla/BC.
---
The BOE question is simple: if it is not established at the start of the run by the party leader, then it's the same rules as BOP.
---
edit: I see this particular case doesn't apply. The druid had a run-in with somebody who was not very sensible before. I do see legitimate disagreement about BOE rules because it is quite literally worth market value to all party members, but "need" is typically understood to only apply to pure utility.
---
Has honor been introduced to the game already? I just inspected a warrior and there was a honor tab.
---
Nop you can kite a mob indefinitely if you hit them every 10 ish seconds, as long as you don't go where they can't (like kiting a fish out of water or some mobs into water that they don't like).
---
I see what I assume are adults keyboard turn constantly, so he's at least beating them.
---
you mean OUR wife? your wife gives me her mage water
---
yeah, bad/shitty locks aren't good - but that can be said of every class.
---
my 1st 60 was a lock as well! my 1st classic 60 is a war and i have a smattering of alts that i'm levelling on rested exp. i have my epic mount so i don't really need to farm gold. i should but idc. im also flipping recipes and the like so that helps a bit.
---
If only my saps ever lasted longer than 5 fucking seconds.
---
&gt; I only run strat live now if I get the first orb.

Question is... why are you in feralas at level 36?

You remind me of a pizza cutter.

Is wow reddit?

OUR wife.
---
Thank you, friend!
---
Yes your boat will learn bite naturally. A pet that doesn‚Äôt naturally know the a skill (bite/claw/etc) you have to train a pet with that skill use them for a bit then your other pet can learn it.
---
You hit 54, congrats you're now in the endgame! You do not need to quest to hit 60 anymore. If you just grind dungeons for the gear you want, you should hit 60 easily before you get everything on your pre-raid wishlist. Diremaul coming out is a bit of a kink in that, because it replaced a number of BRD items and is generally a higher level. You can basically do all of BRD at 54, and by 58 you can do all the others (I think LBRS maybe 56?).
---
https://sixtyupgrades.com/set/t1AQkF9EhhHBSupmJBZnK8
---
Here's a quick "sane" gearing list for your pre-raid set. Nothing crazy pricy like boe items, super hard to get epics, or raid related stuff. Learn to use the website, and you can pick/choose upgrades. You might want to work on some minor but useful pieces out of BRD (like omnicast boots) to help smooth out the leveling process.
---
Super annoying because I **know** you had all the aggro.  
---
Him not healing you is like expecting a mage to tank a pack.
---
oh boy... Reddit is going to get mad at you...
---
edit: nm I just realized this affects everyone. not just one class. You'll get your votes no worries.
---
Spare mana as paladin? Wut
---
I'm a warrior who likes wasting time, I think I'm gonna do this... They said the epic mount grind would be terrible as a warrior but I got mine right when I hit 60 so this can't be thaaaat bad, right?..
---
I recognized the guild, though I suppose it probably isn't an uncommon name
---
I take it back, I only made it until his friend started drinking.
---
Not anymore, class trinket + second wind is better. Still good to get for a shadow set though
---
Thanks, im going to just ignore them instead and try to find groups that seem more chill. Mostly though Im probably going to not do that many dungeons, maybe 1 or 2 runs instead. Depends on how often a gnome is attacking me while questing.
---
i was certain that i would resist...3 days after launch i got a sub -.-
---
now im in the process of trying to dial back my playtime. i have my epic mount so there's no 'push' to continue gearing up/gold. i have alts that im slowly levelling.
---
Already better than a 2006 raider!
---
Alliance is better for pvp and pve. Also our cities are much better positioned. This is just straight up false
---
Dumb question. Why would i print screen, fish for a screenshot in some random folder, upload it to imgur, drag the imgur link to reddit?  I can just take the picture, and within two clicks have it uploaded. Ok retard.

No. "Unpopular opinion" is just a way to farm karma.

holy fuck I hope not.  I mean I guess but just no.
---
I hope not, primarily because I don't want them to have a single kink in the armor of "no microtransactions" to start wiggling through.
---
my personal view is need all blues and purps BoEs.
---
my in game view is - talk to the group before rolling.
---
I'm a Tribal Leatherworker, I just tell people to give me what they think is fair.  I get 10-20G per Devilsaur piece usually saying that.

I dont have the new hotness cloak yet, but see people charging way more for that one.

She said "show me your penis".

30 min queue on Sulfuras as well, yikes!
---
Thank you.
---
Can he join my guild
---
The guy on my server really messed up, alliance side Kurrinax.. says he will beat any competitors for crafting fee. 2 people have the ability to make it
---
For the most part, I‚Äôll throw them heals until it becomes a chronic problem. I‚Äôve usually got plenty of leeway so an extra heal here and there isn‚Äôt a huge issue. But if they are pulling threat, and generally keeping themselves at 10% consistently, they‚Äôre on their own.
---
Yes. All none.
---
Ok person who reserves things lol.
---
Your server is jacked then. That tank will get dick without everyone else in the group just have to have patience and look for someone who is on the same page
---
If you want to go there, nobody needs boe world drops because they would have already bought them off the auction house if they needed it.
---
Yep. Playing with someone for the first time when they‚Äôve never played or you haven‚Äôt played with them is very magical.
---
Well 15 mins consistently a run is very possible now. Where it‚Äôs too spicy is 5 runs an hour lol. Also resists on FD are a thing so no matter what eventually you‚Äôll wipe to it
---
Jesus I was just there on Incedious (spelling?) place was crawling with ally/horde
---
Wow, I'm shocked that this is a thing (at least from here in my cave). It explains why some are asking to need.
---
It's absurd to have a culture of monetizing all loot above usefulness to that brave warrior who just helped it drop. Fuck that noise. Need is need; I'm running that dungeon for fun and loot, not for liquid assets.
---
I saw some of this in EQ recently as well, which I attribute to an unfortunate layer of Krono-kapitalism smothering the game (but without it, would the game exist?).
---
You must play on Faerlina lol
---
Wait are you sure that spell batching actually does that to elemental mastery? If so that's crazy... maybe it's better than natures swiftness now?
---
I mean, it's kinda weird being followed around by a guildie. They don' t know it's 3yo behind
---
My reasoning had nothing to do with #nochanges.
---
Currently sitting at 28mins on Sulfuras. It's the first queue I've had in probably 3 weeks.
---
Once blizzard let's you buy boes on the ah, your logic would work.
---
The fact that he's a paladin makes it even funnier, apart from the broken gear part he's playing his class pretty damn well
---
Its not griefing if its the opposite faction..
---
Yeah im in a similar boat. Im level 42, dot think I will make it to 60 before phase 2 as theres so many damn games coming out and my subsciption is going to run out soon as well, I cant afford this shit lmao. But my end goal in classic is going to be to raid naxx, it has been my dream for a long time :D. Just dont know when.
---
This is the same mentality the dps try to use against tanks for daring to tank for them. I'm not passing on bis and it's a false equivalence to compare bis to non-optimized need rolls.
---
Yup. Put reserve in your title, I sure ain't fucking healing your party.
---
I don't get it. Wasn't a thing back in the day at all
---
Where‚Äôs the rest of your abilities and action bars and action bar addons and keybinds
---
They get one whisper, and if they continue, I whisper the tank/party leader and ask about replacing them. I won't usually let them die unless they'll be easily replaced and it's okay with the tank. My first responsibility is ALWAYS the tank, then myself, and if I don't have enough mana to keep us both up, then I start getting noisy.  :)
---
As an undead warlock, I usually lifetap+cannibalize to get me to around 80% hp. A lot of the times the healer heals me to 100% though which is unnecessary

Benediction. It's the 4-5 highest pop Server and it's a dead even 50/50 balance.
---
Coming off of Faerlina will be a shocker tho. You're going from cities with 500+ players to cities with 50ish. Finding groups are slower too.
---
I made the switch, leveled a too to 40 and then switched back to Faerlina.

You do know what world drops are.... right?

Stam&gt;int&gt;spirit&gt;agility&gt;str typically for leveling. 38+ you can buy shadoweave gear with spellpower which I would recommend. Spellpower doesn‚Äôt matter that much until around then anyway, so at 28 you don‚Äôt have to worry about it.
---
Yikes. That‚Äôs pretty cringe my dude.
---
Yeah SM levels were the worst for the elitism. Mages were real douche bags, and healers/tanks that wanted spell cleave groups were also douche bags. Once you get higher and they realize you can't just spellcleave the entire game, they start to humble up
---
‚ÄúWhat about blackstone ring? Quick strike ring? Painweaver band? He‚Äôll let me roll need on them, won‚Äôt he?‚Äù

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt count on it.‚Äù
---
The worm pet family isn't in Classic. It was a WotLK addition.
---
No ... No they don't ... Also the same GM that's been doing the case reviews through Reddit confirmed all this in the two threads he found to be false flags because of 1) a person accidentally trading too much gold between his characters and had several GMs state that the ban would hold despite him owning all the characters the gold went too and finally it got overturned, and 2) the one that was accused of account sharing and RMT after they went on vacation and was willingly offering to provide all supporting documentation to confirm that he had simply gone on vacation but they simply had ignored it and tried to just leave him banned instead before it got overturned as well.
---
Ya someone people bullshit for sympathy like the most recent one involving RMT, but definitely not all of them and they sure as hell don't review the account before banning lol
---
Okay so you'd agree everyone should greed, yeah?
---
If that's the case, everyone should be needing, since it's the same thing except you can't get ninja'd.
---
Ive opened a ton of lockboxes for people and Ive sound the standard is 50s per lockbox. I never ask for a tip but that seems to be the usual tip.

I teach kindergarten, he would do well in my class of 5 year olds (his reading/writing might be a bit behind but that's about it)
---
&gt; Locks should be drinking along with the healer during mana breaks, though.
---
This is the essential part. Locks that don't bandage/eat when I'm drinking immediately lose my respect.
---
The only thing slowing me down personally is the guilt of rolling against my tanks(which I don't do), I do have a few decent plate pieces I picked up guilt free though
---
Is +X Shadow Damage exactly as it sounds? Like does +17 Shadow damage add 17 damage to my total shadow bolt damage, and 17 damage to curse of agony's total damage done over 24 seconds?
---
Appreciate the input mate.
---
Yeah I stopped buying spells at like 34 to save for mount (priest)
---
No to server transfers but yes to race appearance and faction change (maybe not faction I have to think about it)
---
Why are you downvoting this man? He is right!
---
Bro Sulfuras was almost queue free for so long. Did they remove layering?
---
That would obviously be ideal, but it's just not practical.
---
Bliz trying to force transfers. Nothing to see here
---
Wow, that looks absolutely terrible
---
Is it only with wow?
---
Spell batching, I can deal with.  I remember that.
---
Melee hitting me before they before they‚Äôre in range of some spells, that seems a bit ‚Äúover adjusted‚Äù from what I remember.

Do video games at such a young age mess up anything like cognitively?

Oh dear... there comes the real hardcore experience
---
People? They're his friends and should be addressed as such!
---
This is false. It should be "Yes to server transfers, no to faction changes". FTFY
---
Fair enough. What they also mentioned since you worded it as "microtransactions wiggling through" as in, more will appear has been confirmed to not happen. They said the only service they'd agree to was paid transfers. I know plans change etc. but that's what they said in the Q&amp;A
---
Totem Timers Classic is great.
---
Weak Auras is ok if you're willing to learn how to fucking code the damn thing.
---
Trinicia, don't worry. I know you can't follow any line of thinking period.
---
I think appearance change would be fine as well, keeping your name locked in though of course. I don't see anything wrong with paying to change your hair style/color, face, features, skin color, or gender. Especially since Blizzard *most likely* will not add the barber to classic.
---
To guild leader : A guildie is following me around and hitting my mons and never responding. Is this type of behaviour condoned in our guild?
---
Guild leader : I guess I shouldn‚Äôt have spam invites random people 
---
Well no shit you dingus
---
OK, but you're just being an asshole for rolling like that. In the situation we're talking about very clearly the bigger upgrade is for the hunter than the warrior.  Armor pieces are another subject, like if a warrior wants to roll on leather/mail, fine by me thats actually his BIS and its a similar upgrade to me, but when I played you don't fuck with weapons upgrades like that. Like technically the Rend swords set are really good for a hunter, but no fucking way in hell would they ever get them and they might get blacklisted on their server for winning them against warriors and rogues. How is this situation any different?
---
This.  Id give the whiney bitch a warning and tell him to clean the sand out of his vagina.
---
Although not as confusing, we still have RFC, RFD, RFK as Horde :)
---
I‚Äôm for it, ultimately because I think the number of servers aren‚Äôt sustainable and because I‚Äôd like to get into a West Coast server at some point.
---
Oh yeah well I hit level 51 today.
---
Or cus he‚Äôs four.
---
whojamba?
---
You can still ninja skins in PvE for the sluggish of hands...
---
If you need you need. Im just kinda sad now that 2 purple BoE has dropped that my priest could instant equip for a major upgrade but all parties are Like "all need" so you can cash it out for money. Why is purple gear where we change opinion? If i need on all blue BoE ill probably make around the same in the end. It's Called need because you need it, not because you want it.
---
I guess he meant about WPVP with Honor in Phase 2.
---
i mean, 20 minutes is nothing tbh.    
---
Faerlina is 2 hours haha
---
What's your job?
---
Could anyone else do your job?
---
Do you get paid for the services/goods you render for the job you do?
---
Those three questions (unless you are unemployed and have never had a job before) should answer your question through comparison. 
---
It is his job (in game "profession") to make those items. You can either take it from him and pay him. Or you can not pay him and wait for the next guy to come around and hope that he too won't charge as much or give it for free. Probably not likely. 
---
But as more people can begin supplying the item, the lower the price will go. Until then, it will remain very expensive.
---
again, not claiming i got hacked and i did not buy/sell gold or power level. thank you for your time
---
That buff came way later
---
Got hit with a queue on Grobbulus for the first time this month as well.
---
I believe for the black borders, the majority of people use the addon "lortiUi".
---
I had to get my 4 year old his own account, he kept demanding to play with me. Now we run around on Bob and MummaBob (not the real names). I also use it to /p words at him and get him to read them :)
---
Spell batching isn't needed. It's literally a relic of the days of bad servers/internet. It was artificially added in classic and provides literally no benefit or improvement to the game.
---
Yeah theres a 30 minute queue for Grobbulus too.  I haven't waited in a queue for over a month.  Unusual.
---
I assume he just physically follows them, which, if anything, would be more unsettling to see following you around for hours without talking.
---
Some recipes are expensive, and people want to make the money back.
---
These neckbeards must be hitting the gym an awful lot cos them orcs are BUFF

Of course. As with most of my hobbies I'll go hard for a while until something else grabs my attention or one day I just don't feel like logging in.

Lol fuck off he‚Äôs four years old, probably better than alot of scrubs on this sub

download spinx gathermate data addon then try to import it

You get paid for water? I just get people asking me

Sometimes they even just run up and open a trade window without saying anything

Omfg this is SO CUTE.

Usually you send something CoD or use AH

Right on my man. They don't bring me down.  They are a comedy outlet. We've paused 3 times to laugh at these sad souls. See you in Pantheon my dude!

---
Honest question from someone who doesn't believe video game violence affects anything.
---
Do you think normalizing the idea of killing something for a three year old yields any potential danger?
---
I honestly just don't know anything about child psychology and it is probably fine 99.9% of the time.... I've just never heard a three year old saying he killing something before so it got me wondering.
---
This is a very popular opinion
---
This, but there's a few items that are exceptions, that I feel are "everyone roll need" items, and most pugs I've been in operate this way. I'm talking Shadowfang or Staff of Jordan or Edgemasters. Stuff that's worth epic mount levels of gold at a certain point.
---
Yea im not a parent or anything but have a 4 year old niece and OPs kid seems pretty advanced for his age. he's even mouse turning!

Most because alliance gather in stormwind for their buff.

BC of what a nightmare it is to move just that short distance in Ashenvale, you likely saved 20 minutes anyway.
---
Hey einstein
---
Yes it would have???
---
rofl how fucking terrifying
---
There's a lot of assholes on Faerlina. I had an arms warrior mock me for taking Thrash Blade into an MC pug. Then when I shared my guild's strategy for Shaz (melee sit out off to the side until like 25% then go ham), he ridiculed me despite the raid leader saying it was a solid idea. And he also bragged about getting high on the DPS charts for Baron when all the other melee would run out of the AOE in advance and he'd sit there soaking it up for 3 seconds like an idiot. First time I actually set someone to ignore.
---
The funny part is that it's actually fairly common, about 1/3 chance. You can easily do about 4-5 runs in two hours and likely get 2-3 reeds.
---
Yep Pantheon or Camelot Unchained!
---
Is there an age limit for this game though? Terns if service?
---
Considering we can't even have proper Warlock Infernals I don't recommend anyone hold their breath :(
---
"Professionalist".  This, for anyone wondering, isn't a fucking word.
---
Also, the APA allows for screen time after the age of 2.  A professionalist would know this.  Jesus.
---
edit: god damnit we've been trolled fam
---
Classic is a great game Blizzard is not sorry boys but I'm out
---
Is there one main site for classic addons that I should use?
---
Just in case you're doing the parental worrying that you really are wrong I don't think you are :) We have the same philosophy. So do a lot of our friends. You aren't using electronics as a babysitter, looks like you're having fun and enjoying a hobby with your kid.
---
Can't do that anymore. Can't polymorph tapped mobs.
---
Now yes, when I did a thousand BRD lava runs it wasn't.
---
Theres only 1 healer in a dungeon grp. And u can not join grps where ppl are rolling offspec. Hardest piece to get is trinket.
---
Same reason there is a thousand mage aoe guides?
---
Under which file do I save it in the wow folder ?
---
That entire post was, like, my opinion, man. It's just a status symbol, in my opinion, just like everything else I said.
---
I'm not happy about your questioning. I'm not unhappy about your questioning. It's just a waste of time for both of us, that's all. You obviously aren't going to change my opinion and I'm not going to change yours, nor do I care to. I was responding to someone that isn't even you so this entire conversation is completely different to begin with.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs mostly the part that was kinda blowing my mind. Just on him saying killing. Maybe he doesn‚Äôt actually fully conceptualize but  is repeating the verb for what‚Äôs happening.
---
I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not a big deal. Just a funny quote....
---
Did you join an AoE/Spellcleave group? That‚Äôs probably your problem.
---
cool post
---
There would be a special place in Hell for the person who reports a parent letting their child have some fun in game.
---
This link needs a bit more examination though for full transparency, as mage only beats warlock on 5/10 boss fights when you look at each one individually, with a few of the stand outs being potential AoE fights. So it isn't AS cut and dry as you make it seem.
---
Oh daymn. I don't think I could personally justify that, I'd likely just trash it instead. I got a single rugged leather from one yesterday, so would've been a big loss on that if I paid 50s.
---
Is rather be killed
---
The video creator is an idiot.  Tips Out is super annoying, but this guy is just jealous as hell.  He's doing the same thing to get money, except now he's milking Tips content for money in addition to classic wow.
---
If they're not grouped (they weren't) he was 100% stealing his kills. 
---
I'm not mad I'm just saying.
---
Then just stay in Azeroth then.
---
Flying was perfect in Outlands, it's when it was broght planetside that Blizz shit the bed by failing to think things out.
---
If I ever leave for a break more than 5 mins. I always find both our characters have hearth'ed home. Its one of his favorite things to do. We call it "going back to base".
---
lol this is how I did quests as a warrior solo. RIP
---
Yeah that's exactly what he's saying.
---
Sticking to the "all greed because that's what the buttons mean!" is just terrible logic. You're opening the door for dishonest people to profit off of your resistance to reality.
---
All need on boe's, not because everyone is greedy and only wants to screw over the world to get their epic mount, but because you all deserve the same shot at the loot and it's the only way to make sure no one takes advantage of the rest of the group.
---
True, sometimes it gets wasted.  But youre sending a message that you are helping the group and not just standing around.  You eventually get into a rhythm as the run progresses
---
This is not an exploit.  When the guards that patrol outside are close enough, they will aggro, they will jump up on that ledge and beat the ganker to death.  
---
It's unfortunate that they are too far to protect you from gankers when you are camping Qia, and you might be surprised to know that there are no guards in some of the other buildings in Everlook... 
---
Make sure you keep reporting the cheaters who attack from rooftops though, that's bannable for sure.
---
Shit like this makes you realise just how petulant and toxic people can be... I've had many friends like this in real life, they would snap at the smallest thing, overreact and just be petty fucking assholes for not getting their way.
---
That's literally what the post said.
---
It's not like they're worth shit until phase 3 anyways.
---
Lol owned
---
My Realm Selection window says Skeram is "Layered"...
---
Ok so I just checked the top log for a warrior on ragnaros and he's pushing 1.1k dps.
---
Now the number 1 log for a shadow priest is 570dps and that is also bearing in mind the fact he is being innervated as well as power infusioned.
---
Not sure of your definition where 55% output is "competing", does that mean I'm "competing" with Usain bolt when I run the 100m in 16 seconds.
---
People like that "every guild has a few bad apples".
---
No shit, if you invite everyone who doesn't have a guild tag, odds are you are getting all the bad apples other guilds got rid of.
---
I just hit max after rushing 50-60 in dungeons, now I have a desire to waste my time questing for the fun of it...

If ur orc. Ace of the deep woods, and furry axe this is BIS till 2x deathbringers.

Hi, are there any rules about guilds with the same name? My guild &lt;Knights of the Alliance&gt; has been up for over a month now, and just today someone went and made the guild &lt;KnightsoftheAlliance&gt; without spaces. Is he allowed to do that?
---
My mate charge 1g for a stack of the better water... and people pay it..

&gt; "It's just nostalgia, the game will be dead in 2 weeks, everyone will quit when they remember how bad it is"
---
&gt; Top kek.  
---
I'm replying to OP statement. I'm not specifically talking about Skeram. While this post is about Skeram, OP quotes a statement that encompasses all the servers.
---
The true Path to Glory.
---
The Booty of Bae
---
Or even just offer to pay the other four people for it. I think most groups would prefer a guaranteed 20g for everyone vs a 1-in-5 shot at 100g.
---
I know multiple people who have bought gold without getting banned, one of them a considerable amount.
---
56.. it's gotten to the point where i'm only playing with rested exp.
---
Casuals also quit the game a month later because they couldent care less about the franchise, and can clear all the content easily in that time. There is no drive to put actual time into the game, and that's not a good model for a game that makes its money off of subscriptions.
---
I've thought of the concept of "paid reserve". If the item drops, the reserver pays its price in gold to every person that would've needed. It's a small gesture, but better than nothing.
---
Rag is a very bad example for multiple reasons. You have to look at the overall data including thrash (witch Is the most important part of MC BTW)
---
If this helps at all +1 agility grants 1 att power and 1 crit and 1 dodge chance point +1 strength grants 1 attack power as stated by another comment every 14 att power is 1 dps on each weapon and in essence all the stats you care about are just stacking attack power so take att power gear if it is a decent amount more than agility and even 1 more than strength on your gear as they are essentially the same thing. Also just for info stamina adds 10 hp per stamina. Hopefully that helps you understand what you are looking at a bit that knowledge is what helped me get better at stat selection on my gear!
---
Edit: also all of this only applies to rogues as other classes use stats differently for example warriors gain 2 att power per strength point which makes that their primary stat for damage.
---
It‚Äôs almost like people aren‚Äôt feeling obligated to play all day everyday anymore.
---
i tell them if they give me water i will heal, else then can die in their own fire...
---
If they want to keep the gravy train rolling you can bet your ass TBC will be released.
---
Classic+ is never going to happen,  it is financial suicide and would divert the ENTIRE sec team from Retail/WoW2 for at least a year.
---
It makes no business sense to take that kind of risk polluting Classic in this way when they can simply roll out TBC for 1/5000th the cost and time investment.
---
yeah this actually impressed me...  this kid is going places.
---
Saying everyone need so everyone's roll counts equally and no one can swoop in at the end and need to steal the item is ninja logic?
---
The lack of cognitive awareness in these threads just blows my mind.
---
Path of Glory? :D
---
Back when I played Vanilla on the Alliance side I called the cities Lagwind and Ironlag.  I had to do all my city stuff in Darnassus.
---
Destruction is instinctive. Go try to build a block tower in a room of three year olds and see how far you get. Hint: Not far.
---
Legit. 
---
Back in Vanilla we had an older guildie with a 10yr old that he‚Äôd let farm nodes for a bit. That‚Äôs how the kid earned his allowance.
---
That sign won‚Äôt stop me because I can‚Äôt read!
---
So much fun, not gonna lie.
---
All star points are calculated based on your performance within your class. All that shows is the best priests parses are higher in relation to the rest of the priests, compared to the top performer on other classes in regards to other people playing their specific class.
---
People don't want an even fight they want to stomp.
---
Oh fuck. That makes sense then. I just figured I shouldn‚Äôt have any threat since I didn‚Äôt attack the murlocs. Must‚Äôve just been a proximity thing then
---
F
---
AH bots, gotta love them!
---
I‚Äôm on the side of the OP....
---
1g per port is the norm as I'm pretty sure the mats for a port is something like 45 silver. I cant remember. But yeah 1g per port. 2g depending on how long they have been asking.
---
OP has 3 kids and still has time to knock out the wow. 
---
My hero.
---
Who is worked up?
---
Also you are dodging the actual argument.
---
‚ÄúHe-hello??‚Äù

‚Äú....‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you want??‚Äù

Knew I made the right decision putting up with the queues at launch to not have to deal with this.
---
OP posted a vid of his kid "helping"  
---
His main movement is /follow. Out of 6 mobbs, he stole 1. Cant be that hard, to tap a target against a Paladin to begin with.
---
Classic alliance!..jk! Awesome kid
---
Basically the import screen won‚Äôt let me import anything
---
Had an epic dagger drop in uldaman which I would of used, cause purple. Lost the roll to a druid, which didn't annoy me cause we all ended up rolling need. What pissed me off was the warlock chewing out the druid for winning it when he was the one to need in the first place. Kids will be kids
---
There were fewer people when I went after.
---
&gt;People run dungeons to get this crap so they don't have to "buy them",
---
If you're running dungeons to get boe world drops so you don't have to buy them then you're doing it wrong, friend.
---
This is the stuff that drove me insane.
---
Tryhard
---
That is so dang cute o my
---
Well i hit a big snag today, things were going great. I was averaging 3 stacks an hour and looting really decent world drops. I made around 100g every 4 hours by pick pocketing and world drops. Today the ally presence was tough. I‚Äôve had to move on. Felwood cloth farm is bad. Drops are not as common as wowhead claims. I‚Äôm debating on going to Silithus or just switching gears and farming leather in a level appropriate zone for gold to convert to cloth.
---
If I can see you, you are no longer in stealth and I can attack you
---
That's not a logical extension of this argument (rolling fairly on BoEs  because they give everyone equal utility.) You can't deny that a Thunderfury on a class that can use it effectively it will give them much more utility than whatever its vendor price is, so they should be distributed to the classes where they have the highest utility. BoPs and BoEs differ in that BoEs give everyone equal utility while BoPs give some classes more utility than others.
---
Thottbot
---
I really like this build, it looks really solid and optimized for pick pocket runs. My only gripe is I think improved sprint is really nice for these runs. Not by any means required but on pyromancer you do have a chance to get frozen via his minions, in which case he will back off and cast at you. It's a rare occasion but is a run killer without that talent imo. Besides that I think its very solid.
---
I'm not 100% sure I'd riposte will work on the bosses we farm in this run? I'd be interested to see. I do think Dirty Deeds is a great addition. If I need to farm hardcore again, i could see myself swapping to this type of spec for sure - very well done.
---
Legend says hes still chasing you to this day...
---
Then they obviously haven‚Äôt removed the layers realm wide or updated the list. Lmao go log on the server right now and look around.
---
i have same issue. even with firefox off and everything up to date.
---
did you solve it?
---
Fury warrior here, was running BRD for the heck of it, HoJ drops, one rogue in party who already had it and I won with no competition.
---
2 Angerforge kills at that point.
---
I‚Äôm sorry
---
Or they dont play as much, there are less people on holiday to play the game for example
---
I paid 250 for the combine yesterday. Doesn't bother me since the helm will be relevant all the way to AQ/Naxx if not for all of classic.
---
Who pissed in your Cheerios this morning?
---
i had to run one to kargath the other day and let the guards kill him
---
For lockpocking most rogues shout free LP up to a certain level and they are happy to do it free of charge as they are leveling LP.
---
Other than that most people do about 25 silver for lock boxes that are 225+ ea
---
Me personally I heard a bunch of them and send them a to one character, then have a guilty do it for free.
---
Why would you not want server transfers, but have wiggle room for faction change?
---
This is great. I have a photo of my son around that same age playing as a Hobbit in LOTRO. He really liked to just make the character jump. He'd also sit on my lap while I was playing and hit the space bar, usually in mid-cast of something.
---
Don‚Äôt forget your catseye elixir!
---
So demand a fee instead of asking for a tip.
---
A tip is a generous act from the customer. It‚Äôs not expected, required or asked for. It‚Äôs them saying thanks with a gift in return.
---
A fee is the cost of a service. It is expected, required and asked for. The value of the fee should be known in advance by the customer.
---
Demanding a ‚Äútip‚Äù is stupid. Charge a fee.
---
I suspect this has something to do with how tipping is expected in the US retail segment that underpays their staff with the expectation that customers will pay an additional fee above the cost of the items purchased.
---
Also dumb, but hey, ‚ÄòMerica.
---
&gt;*I think it's very greedy to need on those at a low level.*
---
Then it's a good thing you weren't one of the designers implementing the system that separates those two ideas (they even made *greed* a little coin!) and instead are part of the community trying to enforce your own interpretation!
---
My 63 year old dad can‚Äôt manage that part
---
I find it insane to leave a 1% drop chance open to be taken by a random other person when you could fill the group with people who need other kinds of loot. (you help each other get different loot) Whether or not you call it reserving, not competing for rare drops happens and is reasonable. I end up not inviting certain classes sometimes. We're running sunken temple to get my priest buddy some items so I'm not inviting other priests.
---
Ofc this wouldn't really work with something like dal'rends.
---
But in general the "going against the spirit of the game" just seems like bullshit to me. Nobody makes a grp with 2 warriors and a hunter to farm the savage gladiator chest.
---
I often send friendly greetings to alliance players who cross my road - by purging them. It makes such a nice sound =)
---
My older daughter, now 6, was at this level of speech at that age (and further now, I sometimes forget I‚Äôm taking to a 6-year-old level of maturity). My current 3-year-old daughter, while more physically gifted, is not at this level of speech. From my own experience of my daughters and numerous kids of friends and family, this 3-year-old is more advanced on the language scale, and excellent motor control of the mouse. (I won‚Äôt even get into my older daughter controlling iPads and iPhones. Holy shit.)
---
... You guys are getting paid?
---
Warlocks easy beat mages on single target fights like many bosses ,np there :-) .And even when they don't use CoA
---
Ya but the point is the pet on its own is gonna be useless, and doing that runs the risk of making the pet run away for the hunter
---
Why do you give a shit what someone's in game name is?
---
This reserving bullshit never used to be part of dungeons in vanilla and it can fuck right off. 
---
The only exception was hardcore guilds that were trying to max out the guilder healer or tank etc. But even then the guildies were in agreement that it was for the cause.
---
Even when new, super-hype MMOs or expansions launch, there are queue times that drop off after a couple of weeks.  People just naturally start investing less time as their hype wears down or they can't put off responsibilities anymore.
---
That and we always knew there would be a small mountain of tourists that would play for a couple of weeks and then bounce.  The current population of WoW classic is still *much* larger than anyone expected, though.
---
My GM lives in BRD doing this, he's at about 3k gold now. I'm nearly 60 on my alt and I'll be doing this method on my main (Rogue) to pay for their epic mount. It does suck having to respec though, cutting into profits.
---
If a boe epic drops im needing that shit idc like im not gonna wait until everyone greeds then needs ima insta need
---
Lighten up boomer
---
Mine's 41! But I'm all out of rested XP now, and I fully expect y'all to catch up in the near future. :)
---
As a fellow bloodfang I can abide by this, tanks are not a rarity in this realm, they're almost extint.
---
Yes, I know tanks are scarce and the reasons why, but scarcity is one thing, not finding anyone is another.
---
And since DM opening, getting them for other stuff people still need for quests/pre-bis like lbrs/strat/scholo/ubrs is even harder, everyone and their mother is grinding DM this days.
---
I'm halfway on the pre-bis grind and \~200g short on mount, might as well level a war after so I can see that world with my own eyes
---
Horde:Kromcrush
---
Im still getting 5k queues every night
---
Being gay =/= being trans
---
Oh no...  my warrior is only level 34... how will I survive after retal is down?
---
I appreciate the dedication to making the other guy wear gul‚Äôdan clothes
---
Great comparison!
---
Thanks for the thorough answer.
---
Greatness if you're a 12 yo...
---
And I'm sure this was going on a lot longer than this 2 minute video. If someone was stealing 1/6 of my mobs I'd also be salty.
---
I assume hes talking alterac mountains.
---
I have a question. Some guides suggest that you can repeatedly pick a same door level up lock picking, for example, the SM armory and cathedral doors. How exactly is this done? After the first time, picking a same door doesn't give me points anymore.
---
Ok so shadow priests literally can't aoe which makes them completely useless on imps, as well as most of the time on big corehound packs because they usually can't multidot without getting their shadow word pain removed due to debuff slots.
---
Even on the single target trash they won't outdps any competant rogue or warrior.
---
Also rag is the best example for a shadow priest especially when you consider the melee have to move all the time and a shadow priest is able to stand and cast without having to worry about aggro at all.
---
If you look at the dps differential on a boss like magmadar the number 1 shadow priest did 630dps whereas the number 1 warrior is doing 1500+ dps.
---
&gt;So, it implies that somebody is more worthy of something than everybody else.
---
Well... Yeah? I mean do you think that isn't the situation? Tanks are in higher demand than other classes, therefore they can make higher demands on groups that want them.
---
Every day I see peeps openly calling eachother  f\*\*\*\*\*s in /1
---
About 10k people transferred off the server according to wowhead census which is probably not getting everyone. Also people are definitely not playing as often so there's your 10k que time gone just with those two things.
---
If anything I'd say he's getting a jump start on developing fine motor skills.
---
I do wanna stress it's not by any means required but if you are going to spend a long time there, I'd say over 500g farmed, id change specs. 
---
Pyromancer can be killed with a traditional combat spec, just requires a bit more gear and a little dash of luck. 
---
Happy Thieving Friend.
---
That‚Äôs fine I wanted the tank spot anyway.
---
I dont try hard. I just want fair item distribution and want everyone to have an understanding what make me decide who gets which item first.  
---
The more my guildmates trust me on these decisions, the less drama I expect.  
---
The more transparent I am with my decisions, the more they trust me.  
---
Lead how you want to be led. You cant lead like a jackass and expect everyone else to behave.
---
It follows..
---
Fuck that guild.
---
That thing is broken and janky.  Its fine for updating mods you already have but that's about it.
---
&gt;It's not that hard to find groups
---
So... What is the problem?
---
Also the orbs to tanks is generally because tanks don't get any value out of running completely random pugs through the dungeon.
---
I enjoy trying to reserve my own items on the run in response, especially if it‚Äôs something they‚Äôll want too. 
---
‚ÄòLF healer ubrs. Rend MH reserved‚Äô
---
‚ÄòOkay I‚Äôll come but I want to reserve truestrike shoulders/eyepatch for my dps set‚Äô
---
Shows you how they‚Äôre really just being greedy.
---
This is why you shouldnt be mean to pallys. For all you know they could be three year olds.
---
I mean, you're making the assumption that he knows the kid is 3...
---
This person gets it. It's not all about damage numbers.
---
Grobbulus is wierd because it was targetted as the 4chan server due to being rp (because that means liberal apparently). So although it has balance, it also has some real fuckasses.
---
I'm 52 on my warrior and your 2nd paragraph is on point I don't start questing in a new zone until the highest level quests arw yellows and all the entry quests are green
---
Dude, for real, stop being stupid. If they dont life drain to get health back then screw them. I life tap till dead and then life drain back, omg it's just a 5 man, get over it
---
That‚Äôs a bear...
---
How much? I'll take 2 gunny sacks
---
I can attest to this!  My two year old daughter is clearly the most advanced in her class, as determined by me and my standards which are that she thinks making constant fart noises is funny!
---
prove?
---
I like to think they're spitting their best sales pitches at this "sucker" they finally hooked, only to have their will broken by the silence causing them to rethink their lives and make something of themselves.
---
Almost like the Alliance does buffs pre-Ony in SW
---
Do you know how he locates guild members so often? Seems like he is able to find them enough to cause complaints.
---
Looks like Greta Thunberg made her way to Azeroth
---
Why is he a scumbag?
---
With how well he is playing it‚Äôs time to teach how to mine/herb. Epic mount in no time
---
I think the up to the 100 skill one I tipped 10s, 200 skill one 20 silver, then 30-50s for above that.
---
While this is true, I've had these same mobs do this too. Not attacking them but they'll chase you from BRD forever till you kill them or die.
---
So cute!
---
They're fine.
---
So much shit information before Classic came out, "Druids can't heal" "Warriors best DPS" "Hunters ezmode"...all of which are true in very narrow contexts.\*  So many people read that crap thinking it was universally true.  Sigh.
---
*In case someone's wondering it's:*
---
*- they don't do great as MT bulk healz in raids but you'd be stupid not to have at least one battle rez in a raid too*
---
*- they can be, IF they are geared to heaven*
---
*- Hunters can be easy to play really badly.  The skill ceiling is pretty high to be a GOOD hunter.*
---
Hell, I had an RFC group and I was a bear druid, and a warrior 2 lvls lower *insisted* he should tank it because warriors are better tanks.  At 15 vs 17?
---
its crazy that i used to be in that kids shoes around the same age, and now im about to turn 20 and im still playing the same game. (and still mediocre at it)
---
Except it's not the same logic at all if you would just think about it.
---
A boe is worth exactly the same to everyone: it's gold value on the AH. A bop is worth much more to someone who can equip it than the few gold you get for selling it to a vendor.
---
Ey, fuck you 'mon. Us hunters just want to farm our elites in peace.
---
this is the best classic related youtube content i've seen yet.  legit make more of this.  your kid is awesome at this game, lol.  no way my 5.5 year old could work the game that well if i let her try.
---
Normally I'd agree.  But you're going to have to decide you aren't going to be crit capped, and given our talents and gear set up that's not incredibly hard.  Armor cap is a thing too, but not likely at the gear levels you're seeing this the first time.  So yeah whatever get something you're going to replace for something you're not.  
---
Either way I'm not going to educate anyone arguing in circles with you and you're very committed to not being the best you can be in many things, which is a shame if you actually play a druid, since that's what makes druids a great class.
---
Have a good one.
---
Doesn't seem to apply 100% of the time. No idea why.
---
Sapping the hunter and killing the NPC he has been escorting for 10 minutes -&gt; Best.
---
Meh. Not a concern for me.
---
Mo'om to you, sir.
---
Always have screenshots or vids.
---
What kinda compass you using boy?
---
Thats an option too, yeah
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Path_of_Glory
---
Ya... same experience for people on the other side, you realise.
---
A1 guild name
---
Sounds like you're getting bad luck. I'm a tank and have ran hundreds of dungeons almost exclusively to level and have not seen this once. Maybe find some buddies to do dungeon runs with. That way you can control who is in your group.
---
Yeah I (resto druid) met up with an spriest during SM, stuck with them for the duration until they respecced holy at 60.  Definitely a nice combination.
---
yeah im sure they really realise they cant spellcleave the game when they hit the level to go zf followed by brd and lbrs...
---
Just tried to log into whitemane and was met with a 2000 person queue. So not sure what your talking about.
---
Not at all. Personal loot negates the need for reserving as everyone has their own loot rolls...
---
I won't tbh.  
---
But if your main movement is /follow, you have two issues with your accusations.  
---
1) He doesnt target the NPC first, so you attack first and he does last.  
---
2) Because of that, he rarely moves himself and thus is usually last on the NPC. Which in return makes you tap it first. (Heck, his first button in the left-bottom skillbar is literally /follow.)  
---
Then another point not regarding using /follow.  
---
3) If he wasnt helping you, he'd propably be doing the same quest and steal mobbs from you anyways as hes at the same level range.  
---
It just doesnt add up. I feel like the person who complained is just a complainer in general.
---
Show me a refrigerator that cools substantially better without being plugged in and we‚Äôll talk.
---
Haven't had a queue on bigglesworth since first week and now have queue that layering is removed...
---
So wholesome. Glad you made it in the end. Just send him a note through the mail, I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll appreciate it.
---
Lol that follow macro
---
As an alchemist people can save loads of money by giving me a tip to make a potion for them instead of buying the potions off the ah. Sometimes they can save 1g+ buying mats so they'll tip me 20-50s. Other times they'll only be saving 10s so I get like a 2s tip. I don't charge a fee cause I'm not going out of my way to find out what profit margins are and come up with a fee for every potion to make sure I still save them money while making something myself.
---
see you in epl in phase 2, friend
---
I mean... Literally half the other classes are easier to kill than warriors as rogue, but no warriors arent hard if you arent awful
---
I like how you made the icon for the macro a cow
---
What argument exactly? You should try making one first.
---
Okay ill probably get flamed for this but this gm isnt totally in the wrong. How the fuck is he supposed to know that someone behind the character still shits himself irl? This message doesnt come off as that dickish as long as you concede this gm isnt a fuckin mindreader
---
That said one day this kid WILL be a legend on wow
---
It‚Äôs not uncommon for regular dm North runs to occur, especially now with it being released recently.
---
Plant enthusiasts. But for me, if its red, its dead.
---
He has the hands of a healer. Once he is ready.
---
I can't answer what's the expected WoW population.  
---
Per server, Classic is larger than Vanilla. But Vanilla had a lot more servers than Classic.  
---
The tourist have likely already dropped off. Won't be surprise to see the hardcore playerbase drop off next once they've farmed everything they need and wait for P2.
---
As someone who doesn't generally like kids,
---
Yours is awesome.
---
You can complete it in fucking greens and blues with no consumes with 30 people, that is not the point. 
---
Good guilds have to meet a standard. 4 hour clearspeed is completely unaccaptable. Doing well is fun for some people and for classic raids completing them is not a challenge what so ever, the challenge is to do them well. At least for a while, since MC and BWL are pretty much trivial content.
---
No testing, no patchnote, no nothing. This patch has broken so many things. DMT for example, you can feign, King and Cho goes upwards to your pet, you start loading an aimed shot towards king and Cho turns (BEFORE ITS EVEN COMPLETED). If you 'patch' shit, atleast do it correctly, and test it.
---
*EDIT - Just adding that with doing damage to cho with your pet before - meaning after FD it should have A LOT more treath than you - it still changes target.
---
I love how blizzard is slowly turning this in retail already. So many changes made that deviate from vanilla since launch.
---
Engi invis trinket is the only way
---
I mean...I've had worse pugs.
---
I'm seeing a decently large queue so I assume layering is now gone.
---
I dunno how it is for you since I never played alliance but as an ud mage my stone is set, and will be for quiiiiite so time in Kargath. Acess to lbrs/ubrs/mc/bwl right away.
---
With tps for og and tb I can reach dm in a blink. With uc tp scholo is a 5min run and strat/naxx are one flight away.
---
Only high level stuff outside my range is ZG/AQ, but some engy mages have tp to Tanaris so that's covered too. Myself I'll just set stone to Silithus when the time comes.
---
For ZG, sometimes back in the days I didn't even bother get the zep, just tp uc and go by bat, afk while flying and doing other stuff.
---
It's really a breeze for us.
---
edit: forget about ony, another short flight from og.
---
Even invis potions have to be out of combat like shadowmeld :)
---
tbh. I wouldve made a new wow account with a NE hunter on Faerlina and stop  paying for the orc account. This way you would pay only 1  acc but your orc would be still there if you miss him.
---
On the flip side my CDL trainer has 4 kids and spends most of his limited home time ignoring them while playing WoW. Dark.
---
But what's your queue time during launch night? Saying current pop without comparison is meaningless info.
---
Fur face.. hat. Pops into my head every time.
---
I was playing 60 hours a week the first two weeks of Classic just to beat the levelling crush through some of the bottlenecked zones.  Now I log in once a week to raid.  I imagine queues will probably return with the advent of BG's when people have a reason to log in for more than just the 1/week raids.
---
Maybe for you.  For me it won't even let me direct it to the WoW classic executable...it just shows an empty folder even though the folder is clearly not empty.  As such it's literally impossible to use for anything but updating.  And yes I have hidden files shown and am pointing it to the correctct folder.
---
yeah i know, but its the same a the scarlet doors
---
BC and WotLK were my favorite iterations of Shadow I think. manamana
---
Then why comment? I‚Äôll never understand this about reddit
---
You know what attacks me more than any given toon? A hunter pet.
---
Nothing wrong with following people. If it bothers you *that much*, maybe you shouldn't be playing or should turn the screen off or teleport.
---
Hitting your mons?! God damn mons pushers!
---
&gt;*BoEs give everyone equal utility*
---
Here's where you contradict yourself on your use of utility. Say Shadowfang drops. That gives a rogue in a group much more utility (keeping your Thunderyfury example, which is odd in itself due it not even being a drop but whatever...) over say a druid that can't even use daggers. How is that equal?
---
Fairbanks has at least two to three horde crafters.
---
You have 2 options that make sense:
---
1. Everyone rolls need on BoEs. This is the clear choice if people think BoEs are fair game to sell, even if they‚Äôre an upgrade for someone.
---
2. Everyone rolls greed. By choosing this option you are admitting that you want to sell the item, but someone who actually needs it can roll need to use it.
---
The third option is that everyone rolls greed and you expect no one to roll need ever? This is the same as option 1 but stupid. If you think no one should ever roll need, then why are you opening yourself up to getting ‚Äúninja‚Äôd?‚Äù Clearly these people are dumb
---
I'ts not for people who want to speedrun, it's very simple. When the tank is geared enough to not need a shield, you go furyprot to hold aggro easier. So that the raid doesn't have to slow down their dps.
---
Legit 0 point in having a hearth at theramore since it's right beside IF. Keep your hearth set to the south of kalimdor like gadget or ungoro imo.
---
Really, no one? Fine I‚Äôll say it.
---
‚ÄúShadow Priests melt faces in PvP.‚Äù
---
Hey it‚Äôs that one scene from titanic
---
I'm a troll with a fair amount of spirit, usually by the time the mages are done drinking in back to like 95% good enough for a trash pull.
---
This is so cute it's painful
---
this
---
I always /moo at Tauren players
---
Hmm I don't recall having the problem of getting frozen when I've done this as cb/prep hemo.  Could be my memory or maybe I've just been lucky.  I suppose you could take points out of ass to get imp sprint, or go 4/5 Camouflage and 2/3 Setup.  Alternatively you could pop a FAP or just burn vanish (provided prep is up) to reset and hope it doesn't happen again.
---
As for Riposte, I think you're right that the disarm effect doesn't work on bosses but it's still a lot of damage for 10 energy.
---
Anyway, thanks for taking a look at my build!  Best of luck in your devious endeavors!
---
Get him on their discord
---
So your statement implies that the drop in queue number is due to server transfers and players playing **less often**?
---
How wonderfully wholesome, too bad he is playing the filthy alliance ;P
---
And what was Whitemane queue time during launch?
---
That's incredibly wishful thinking.
---
Don't recommend. I've known people banned over /away messages.
---
One priest put up "leveling my weapons while watching a movie, will get back to you" back in vanilla or somesuch while they alt tabbed over now and then to convince things to hit them. It got reported and they copped a ban for botting, the message being cited as the reason why.
---
They eventually overturned it but it was a massive pain. Just put /away or /DND with "will get back to you" or nothing at all.
---
If you have a dagger, you can still ambush with a weapon swap macro. I do this on my rogue if I want the damage rather than a cheap shot. Adds some flavor while sneaking about.
---
This is the most embarassing post I have ever seen in any forum, chat, or subreddit regarding world of Warcraft in my entire 14-15 years of experience with this game.
---
IF I COULD BE A 7' TALL COW LADY IN REAL LIFE I WOULD! (Even though I'd prefer to be a catgirl)
---
True. But I made my statement based on peak hour in the region I play on, which is around 7-8pm.
---
That is truely fucking hilarious and awesome.
---
Your kid rules.
---
I think i was eating dirt when i was his age.
---
I saw an MC raid shouting in org looking for tanks (multiple, not just one LOL) and a healer, and they had like 5 items reserved.
---
WTF goes through these peoples minds, begging for tanks but trying to reserve their gear?
---
Imagine the mob waiting at the boat/zeppelin just to keep chasing him across continents
---
#WEE WOO WEE WOO
---
I‚Äôm wanting to do this as holy paladin, what level does it become viable? Deadmines seems slow
---
There‚Äôs a queue on benediction as well, hasn‚Äôt been for a while.
---
that's how you find yourself without a tank
---
perhaps you've never taken economics and don't understand supply and demand?
---
less than 20% of people want to play as a tank. 20% OR MORE are needed to fulfill the tank roll
---
what that means is, if you're not incentivizing tanking, you're not getting tanks PERIOD end of story
---
"i demand you only roll on tank OR dps items" isn't going to fly. they will simply make their own group where they can roll on both and leave you to rot
---
hahahha
---
All of the Bay of Storms requires 425 to never lose a catch. That's where all the pools are, so they also require 425
---
Thank you for sharring.
---
IneedRAMforge
---
LOL, like following someone in game is like stalking IRL.
---
Yea officer, this accout here.
---
classic honor system with modern bots is going to be such a shitfest
---
I snagged a name from a movie played by a female role so I put it on a female toon. It's really that simple.
---
You are allowed to share with family
---
The run with a decent group takes about 5-10 minutes for this piece. They just get to the boss they want kill it and reset to restart.
---
Dead game
---
No it fucking doesnt.
---
It reads the combat log and alerts someone THAT you stealthed WITHIN 150YARDS .... Thats farther than people can target you, if youd dumb enough to stealth and run straight at someone thats on you.
---
Reported for harassment....for following? What?
---
Yeah I've been frozen a few times in my runs. Not a lot, but enough to notice. That's a good point about riposte, good damage burst for sure. Good call!
---
Reserving gear is so fucking stupid. The only people who do it are the obnoxious loot goblins who believe the only purpose of Classic is to acquire the gear on some BIS list they read on a website.
---
Just run the god damn dungeon and roll on gear like the rest of us. The loot will be there tomorrow. You can run it again another day. Randomness is part of the game. It ticks me off how entitled people act when they go around reserving gear. The whole attitude is just so annoying.
---
What, if any, Add-on tracks this?  
---
It'd be cool information to have.
---
It makes sense to change this, but also #NoChanges.
---
&gt; Why is it greedy for me to roll on an item that is a clear upgrade, when it dropped for the group that I am participating in, where I am the only class able to use said item?
---
Because you're running RFK, which mostly provides low stakes lowbie loot that you'll replace in under a week. Your claim of "actual need" is softened greatly by the *extremely temporary* benefit you gain from the item.
---
Truth be told, it's pointless and dumb to argue over lowbie loot at all. Roll need and equip it. Or don't. Fucking sell it. Who cares. It's not worth the time it took you to make this dumb post.
---
That's actually every day business in ungoro.
---
&gt; And honestly, congrats on missing the point of this game.
---
I'm glad we have the ultimate moral authority here to tell us that we can't have fun playing a video game unless it's his way.
---
now, this is just my opinion, but i dont think 3 year olds should buy gold, i think they should farm it themselfs
---
Holy shit dude that is awesome. My 4 year old gamer of a son just watched it with me and was super impressed!
---
False
---
Why 3y old even playing video games lol
---
So I'm not at all a comp sci person. The following questions are genuine questions and not rhetoric: 
---
I've heard the current client for classic is based off of the modern/retail client and not WoW's actual old client--that it's more or less simulacrum. Assuming something of this nature is the truth and knowing that modern WoW seems to be designed around the idea of instances, shards, layers, etc in the overworld: do you think that the modern/retail client or netcode may have alterations/modifications of some kind that arent optimized to carry out the Classic design philosophy of trying to incorporate all players on the same overworld instance (by gradually phasing out layering)? 
---
Anyone who has insight into whether or not this is even a possibility, I'd love an ELI5 even if my questions are completely off the mark
---
I‚Äôm 49 now.  I‚Äôm going to get a few weeks off work in December, so I‚Äôm hoping to hit 60 and have my epic mount before the end of the year.
---
Why do you want to play WoW with OP's son?
---
So if I'm getting in your personal space  and ignoring you when you ask me to back up a bit, I'm perfectly justified because I'm not touching you?
---
That's not how life works.  I realize I'm going against the grain of this comment section by claiming this is a reasonable social expectation, but fuck it. 
---
"If you don't like it you shouldn't play." is a bunch of bullshit.
---
Don't get me wrong.  A few minutes is fine, and is probably the case.  I'm talking a scenario where this is going on for half and hour with ignored requests to knock it off, day after day, which seems to be the scenario OP is  creating.
---
I'm against spam invites too, btw. .
---
Vanilla WoW was my first real game as a really little kid and I can confirm that walking around and typing words at people was the funnest thing ever. I think the tedium sort of appealed to me, it was like an advanced point and click game. Don‚Äôt know how I got past level 10. Come to think of it maybe I didn‚Äôt
---
And they come to the zone in the 30s while the Horde comes in the low 20s
---
I shed a tear for the poor Alliance just trying to level getting killed by Horde 10 levels lower than them ;(
---
Account sharing doesn‚Äôt apply to family member but, the OP also states in a comment that the child has their own account. Even if account sharing applied to family members as well, that still wouldn‚Äôt apply here.
---
Troof
---
layering has no effect on queues, more people logged in because layering was removed most likely.
---
Murdered the hell out of our poor paladin healer in strat the other day. Was kinda zoned out from running the damn place all day. Got two nasty backstab crits back to back with an evis crit to top it off, getting two energy procs from the shadowcraft bonus made it all happen too fast lol.
---
Depends on the sever. On my server over half of the runs I see advertised have something reserved. You can bet that any BRD run you see either has HoJ or SGC reserved.
---
It feels like now they‚Äôre panicking to remove layering before p2, so we just get to live with queues twice (at release, and now). Really wish they would‚Äôve just released realms with normal player limits and merged them later
---
But the game isn't """dead""" like all the doomsayers were saying it would be.
---
DA KING IN DA NORF!
---
Priest: you rolled priest thinking you will get into every group instantly as a healer. Well everyone else did too, and now healers are less desired than mage and warlock dps.
---
It is if you fucked up and your raging hard. Time for a break haha
---
So you have too much hit gear and your itemizing badly.
---
Yeah I can get 20% hit without two rings and devilsaur, does it mean anything? It means I need to learn to gear better.
---
Yeah I know we‚Äôve still been having queues at peak times but I also had an hour and 2k person queue. So I‚Äôm assuming they did the same to us.
---
Word is that they are going to go to phase 2 after blizzcon (later this week). So getting rid of layering before that
---
People pay Mages for something that requires no skill up and uses a free resource to create? yikes...
---
Aw I'm sorry to hear that :(
---
You think you do, but you don't.
---
Probably about a month or so out.  It‚Äôs coming by the end of the year, and I‚Äôd shoot for late November/early December.
---
There isn‚Äôt going to be a good time to do this. It‚Äôs gonna have to just happen and everyone learn to adjust. They were giving away free transfers for a reason.
---
You would have to kill a hunters pet dozens of times before it ran away assuming he didn't just tame it. If the pet is old it dying a few times at worst will drop it from loyalty 6 to 5
---
I didn‚Äôt mean to imply there aren‚Äôt females playing wow. Merely that people that treat people different because they are a female toon are losers. I really don‚Äôt give a shit what gender people are as long as healers keep me alive and dps don‚Äôt stand in fire. I‚Äôm not much of a roleplayer though.
---
You don't? He's always down for dungeons and shit and is always on cuz he doesn't have a job
---
My favorite is to use my Succ to seduce them then /kiss. Surprise threesome with my demon ;)
---
Shitloads of people. You couldn't have a thread on MMO-C's Classic forums without some butthurt retail player popping in to claim that Classic is "just nostalgia, everyone is going to quit" and other such shitposting.
---
Oof... Sorry you're still trying to gear :(
---
I actually passed by Forti in Blackrock mountain tonight and msged him about this post lol
---
We are. I've spent hours killing the escort quest NPC in Westfall. I wait until they get to the very end, kill him, then laugh at the helpless lowbie as he makes the long journey back to the very beginning.
---
Hearthed from theramore to menethil harbour, didnt want to wait for the boat.
---
Question about pvp, when phase 2 comes out and people become worth honor, wont city raids lower your honor since theres alot of low levels in the city that would cause dishonorable kills making world pvp risky when trying to get higher ranks in bgs?
---
When you talk about the effectiveness of the class, you consider everything the class has to offer. When talking about the effectiveness of a specific spec, you consider what that spec has to offer.
---
All warriors has shouts. All paladins have blessings. Shadow priests are the only priests with +15% damage. So if you ask how much damage a spriest brings to the table, you include the damage from that debuff because it wouldn't be there with any other priest.
---
It's silly not to include utility like that. Take brez away from a druid or blessings away from paladins, then ask which healing class brings the most benefit to the table.
---
I would probably sell some of them now as needed. If everybody else saves and tries to sell the price might not go up at all.
---
I got one of these today and it was really expensive. I triple checked every single click because I was so worried about doing this. Hilarious when someone else does it though :p  
---
(Sorry for your loss)
---
It's the Dirk gently school of getting around, obviously they have a plan and know where they are going
---
10-14k.
---
You might be right. If there was another word for it "defeating an NPC in a video game" maybe he would use that.
---
I'M HELPING MY FWENDS KILL WAGNAWOS
---
Gear for...what?
---
Tanks don't need gear from Strat live, I'm in near full t1 on my tank alt. I literally don't need anything from dungeons.
---
I do dungeons because it's a more fun way to get gold then farming in WinterSpring or felcloth. And I have no shortage of groups.
---
Get engineering and throw bombs, thats ur only option. There isnt any good aoe threat abilities or tricks.
---
Swap to 2h and use ww on cd, hope for big damage.
---
Deathbringer, but the dps will hate you. Quell serar works fine or anhilator when off tanking
---
Yes because ZF / BRD / LBRS is the rest of the game
---
&gt; from now on
---
Yes and no. Depends what they‚Äôve been doing and what they want to do. All kids are good at different things and it really is incredible how much of a sponge they are once they‚Äôve nailed the basics. Importantly, a year is a lonnnnng time in toddler and an early three year old version of the same person would seem stupid and incompetent compared to themselves as a late three year old.
---
I'm Warrior doing it just for the chest. Low levels can show up to heal arenas or arenas+anger runs for generic upgrades. I do arenas+anger+golem too, but I try to avoid, depends in the competition in LookingForGroup channel. My party is usually lvl 51-53 healer, 1-2 cloth dps, 1-2 rogues, sometimes I do it 4 man, not wanting HoJ helps.
---
Bots are getting hit pretty hard from my understanding.
---
Fishing water essences in Azshara requires at least 420 skill, and you can still miss with that.
---
Merging dead servers would be better as it won't interrupt the healthy servers imo.  Get your leveling done while you can without having to fight for mobs or farm areas.
---
Layering means less load on each server, allowing Blizzard to increase player count if they want to. They haven‚Äôt released how this works, so you are speculating that layering has no effect on queues.
---
If that is/was true they would have no gold value, because no one will/would buy them. Unless all blue bow demand is driven by irrationality (since no wsg twinks yet).
---
All upgrades are marginal and in isolation are nothing, it‚Äôs the effect of accumulating multiple marginal gains that matters. 
---
~20% more Int on my Mage from being kitted out in dungeon blues over greens absolutely decreases my down time and ups my farming efficiency while extending how long I can go without shelling out for new greens, which are often almost as expensive as boe blues (if any good).
---
If you believe this, it‚Äôs a non issue for you, because you would barely even run dungeons at all, if ever besides maybe a quest run, to level.
---
this is simple adorable, great kid
---
Enable background sounds. That way u always get the fish sounds when tabed.
---
My kid insists on taking my priest to Westfall (in retail) and running through all the whirly winds over and over.
---
All these kids should team up and cause general chaos
---
It‚Äôs no longer layered? I saw earlier today it was but it‚Äôs over now?
---
The people who say they like it like this, and that's how they remember classic are the same people who wouldn't even notice if it was removed in most cases surely.
---
Nobody in their right mind would suggest the player amount, per average, is as high as during launch and the following weeks? That doesn't mean much though.
---
At first I was looking to see if he was actually controlling it! 
---
OP, hell yes your son is advanced!! He speaks incredibly clearly and his coordination and comprehension is out of this world.!!
---
I just feel like it takes away from the actual females that play the game because it becomes hard to distinguish. Is it wrong to assume someone that is playing a female character in an online role-playing game might just happen to be an actual female in real life? and honestly, it sucks to have to ask the awkward question....are you a dude? or are you a real female?
---
Less players =/= "dead".
---
I'm aware of the free transfers. Queue time was not significantly affected by free transfer on my server. By the 2nd free transfer, there wasn't a queue so I don't contribute that to queue reduction.
---
Civilian npcs are the only thing that gives u a dishonorable kill, level is irrelevant.
---
He's also better than many of the asshole 40 year olds currently playing WoW.
---
What's at STV? Sry I'm a nub
---
Did scholo today with some one who had never been there. Took almost two hours and we cleared all but one boss (even did the shaman quest) and it was a blast the whole way. That place is crazy when you look at it through new eyes.
---
r Good luck with 3/5.  /hearth.
---
You want to follow that thought through?
---
Blizz makes layers to allow more people on a server than a vanilla server is allowed.
---
Blizz vows not to break server population limits.
---
Blizz also vows to remove layers before phase 2.
---
So, if Blizzard removes layers, but also honors traditional server limits. Why wouldn‚Äôt there be a queue.
---
I did not specify less players == dead.
---
"Hey just so you know, generally it's not worth aoeing unless there's 3 or more mobs"
---
Level as the drain tank build, Voidwalkers are not that great at higher levels.
---
Thanks. Yep I use Wolfshead Helm. How is the build for PvP situations? 
---
PvP is kind of why I'm inclined towards Brutal Impact. Is it worth giving up two points in Ferocity for two points in Brutal Impact? The extra second should give you the time to bash target, switch to cat, get behind and get two shreds in as opposed to one.
---
My favorite thing to do as a mage is Counter Spell the blizzard of horde mages that tries to steal my grind spot.
---
It's 100% now that Tips legit didn't play Vanilla at all.
---
Oh, wow. But it's a poor quality (grey) item, right? I'm surprised they're bop.
---
An SL / SL lock is still superior.
---
Source:  I was an spriest in Vanilla.
---
Bots??? What?
---
This is actually a really fucking cool bot. I'm glad to know this exists.
---
I have an almost 3 year old daughter and I am just as astonished as you are with how fast they pick these games up. She plays with her dad and she also destroys people at Mario kart on the iPad. She‚Äôs better than me and ‚Äúhelps me‚Äù. It‚Äôs insane. I have no chance at being a better gamer than her, it‚Äôs only a matter of time :(

As a warlock, you are asked to be the first person at the instance entrance. So when someone asks for a teleport, you can point out that you would, if someone else was also there.  
---
I usually start my journey to the dungeon, when we are 2 people in the party.  
---
It just speeds things up and I want people to remember me as the good warlock.
---
Chat being party chat and not direct whispers?
---
I JUST ATE A BIG RED CANDLE!
---
You implied it.
---
did Blaumeux lose layer ?
---
What?

Hi, /u/fizolu

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dltlx1/how_good_is_conflag_spec_in_early_p2_in_a_semi/). 
---
At Gromgol you have Zeppelins to UC and Org
---
We have two druids in my guilds raid team. One our off tank, and one a healer. Needless to say the healer is getting geared as hell because he has no competition for loot...
---
And hes doing great!
---
Hybrid classes in vanilla are amazing if you remember that you are a hybrid and are with a group that is also able to accept you are a hybrid utility that has extra tools, but might not have all the raw power of a focused class. 
---
This is true for all of them (Druids, Shamans, Paladins)
---
..that's exactly the assumption RonGio1 made.
---
If Frostyfyre doesn't know the person he whispered is a child (and there's no indication that he could have or did know that), it is categorically impossible for him to "threaten a child".
---
Operating on that logic, to say Frostyfyre is threatening kids is absolutely assuming he knows the player was three.
---
It's like being at the movies, shushing someone up the back, and then they stand up and say "wow did you just shush a disabled veteran with no arms ~~or legs~~?" and then someone stands up and goes "waow how dare you shush a veteran". No, idiot, I shushed a noisy patch of darkness, their circumstances are irrelevant.
---
hijacking the other comments kinda
---
if you are going the cherry-picking route, see/determine what your worst piece of gear is and replace/target that. also, determine what the biggest upgrade is and target that (these arne't the same thing - e.g. my shield may be my worst item but the lionheart helm is BiS for all phases for a dps war [iirc])
---
They are disabling layering on almost all servers. 
---
As they repeatedly warned us, this is going to result in significant queue times.
---
Not sure, but something's up. I sat in queue for an hour and a half tonight on Whitemane.
---
I have been leveling LW while I leveled. Sold lots of the stuff I made Green leather junk and dusky leather stuff. Mostly try to list things once or twice and then just sell at a slight loss if I can‚Äôt.
---
Might be more profitable to go Herb/Alch or whatever, but I wear all my own gear mostly so it works out.

"Everybody needs gold!" - Every loot ninja
---
For me that was back in the WotLK days (I'm 18 now), and my first character ever was a draenei hunter. I must've begged my stepdad for months to let me play on his account because I thought what he was doing was the coolest thing ever. He stopped playing years and years ago but someday when I have the extra money to burn I'm gonna pay him to renew his account just so I can transfer her over to mine.
---
I was absolute shit at the game but I loved the world so much. Now I'm an artist/high fantasy writer and I owe it all to WoW for making me fall in love with other worlds. It's definitely risky letting your kid get online with a bunch of strangers, but it was an experience that really shaped who I am and I wouldn't trade it for anything.
---
why? anyone who is gonna twink is already buying items now and building their toon, do you think ppl will wait til bgs are out to even remember the concept of twinking at 19?
---
That‚Äôs absolutely hilarious that he plays his own account, has been in a guild for two months, and no one has figured out that he‚Äôs a child...lmao.
---
This is seriously the best post I‚Äôve seen so far. Thanks for sharing!
---
I see only... vaginas for me.
---
&gt; I wouldn't accuse any clothie for needing edgemasters or cloudkeepers: me being a warrior doesn't make me solely entitled to a ~1000 gold drop.
---
if you're gonna use it, it does
---
In my day if you needed an item someone was gonna use just to sell it on the auction house you were a loot ninja.

Now let's go start some Hillsbrad shit!

I'd personally prefer a big ugly face to the shoebox we did get lol. Dimorphism for the sake of it that didn't quite gel with me personally.
---
DPS Fury Warrior here, I tank 98% of the dungeons I do, 95% of them have no other Warrior. I would have to be braindead to not be joining groups faster by being a tank and having the power to veto competition. I'm doing a LBRS run, you see my advertisement and msg me, "sorry full on warriors".
---
Wow watched the video hes actually really good for being 3.
---
That I implied a server without queue is a dead server?  
---
I'm on Oceania largest server which sits between Med-Full constantly. I'm not that dumb to make stupid implication.  
---
However I'm agreeing that a lot of people have rose tinted nostalgia goggles and would quit after a couple of days into the game, as they forgot how frustrating the game can be.  
---
An example. Remember the LFG addon out roar prior to release? Now on frontpage we have [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dljaw3/slashfour_a_thoughtful_lfg_addon_that_doesnt/). Notice how a mentality shift of the community.
---
Wait... this is classic.
---
Where even if you are proficient and an expert, you still can't "Do it".
---
Pallies pre rework where kinda clunky with the judgement system.
---
Gnarly bra, shakas
---
Nice! Thank you for this. Let me make some comments:
---
* **Minimap button** \- yep, doing that!
---
* **Some way to configure how long messages are visible** \- I'll look into this. I don't just want to throw a slider somewhere. I would like it to be more useful than that--like say, automatically adjusting the expiration based on chat volume, maybe on a per-dungeon basis, etc.
---
* **Color-coded "time ago"** \- Ah, yes. You just gave me an idea for this. Will do.
---
* **Show timestamps in tooltip message history** \- There are many features that I tried but which didn't make the cut for one or another reason. This was one of them. It cluttered the tooltip too much, but I will consider adding it as an option.
---
* **Irrelevant messages in history** \- This is definitely possible to do, and also what one would expect. I find it interesting to see these irrelevant messages to gauge the person, but I think you are right that they should go.
---
* **Filter defaults to "All"** \- Yes, I consider this a bug. Will fix.
---
* **Display character level** \- You may think I'm bullshitting, but this is actually not possible to do. Something I'm considering is to also display the level *after a shift-click* in the list somehow and not just in the tooltip.
---
* **Keyword inaccuracies** \- This is my next big focus for the addon: Extensive &amp; easy customizing of keywords (which includes localization). I'm taking inspiration from [Puggle](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/puggle) and [Group Bulletin Board](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/group-bulletin-board), which already do this very well.
---
* **Message spacing** \- SlashFour uses *exactly* the same look as the chat window, and this is part of its appeal.
---
Again, thank you so much for your suggestions, and, really! do keep it coming! :)
---
Instant casts.
---
The mind control you are talking about is from Gnomish Mind Control Cap. It would also serve this purpose.
---
I'm sure frostbolt will be a very thrilling experience for you then
---
We've got about 5 people who can craft now and the fee is only 30g on my realm. Be patient and it'll drop down real fast.
---
you should bind him some emote macros so he can wave at people and stuff
---
The bottleneck is the servers. Server stress scales quadratically with the number of players.
---
So you can gank low level players from the other faction with no penalty?
---
getting good loot is what makes me enjoy the game :)
---
If you're trying to insinuate this is from a steep decline in net players you need to seek medical attention. There has been CONSTANT server migration and transfers under the supervisor and control of Blizzard. People have obviously quit, but it has exceeded even blizzards expectations being that layering is still not off for many servers.
---
Is this who I have tanking my DM North runs? This makes so much sense now.
---
Wait, where the fuck are they fighting Geddon? Is that a new meta I'm missing?
---
Retail has forced personal loot because of people reserving shit
---

---
Go easy on the Ketamine Ketlord.
---
Haha man that sounds like my experiences. Personally I never played during the ‚Äúgolden‚Äù expansions and only started in cataclysm and went into MoP. I didn‚Äôt understand anything either, tanked my first few dungeons with arms spec but I loved the game so much. I quit after Legion 7.1 but when classic got announced I started playing on Elysium and knew I wanted to play the official version when it released.
---
Which is why this post interested me to begin with. I know Blizzard is removing layers slowly prior to P2.  
---
And a couple of days ago, I'm seeing 100+ queue during peak hours, which I haven't seen in nearly a month. Could be because of Dire Maul, but you don't need DM to raid or anything. So I'm wondering if my server queue returned, even if slightly, due to removal of a layer.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8mpnN2fVYQ
---
They are just updating the lists.
---
Only servers still layered are Herod and Faerlina, which have significant queues even with layering.
---
this kid is already a legend! lmao I love it
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm helping my Fwen!‚Äù So adorable üòä
---
Luckily, as a druid, I have a "I'm not being hostile" tell that's pretty hard to miss. If I'm running towards you in cheetah form and don't shift into cat or if I pop out to cow form when I see you, it probably means you're safe.
---
A GNOLL HORDE, DAD! ON AN OPEN FIIIIIELD!

Deviate Delight is 60A/40H. It's alright.
---

---
Holy shit.
---
as someone with a sense of humor, this is hilarious
---
Most rogues are running combat swords while levelling, so they don‚Äôt have a main hand dagger to backstab unless they‚Äôre running combat daggers.
---
But yes, some rogues don‚Äôt pay attention and only play rogue for the class fantasy. I know this as I am a rogue myself.
---
That‚Äôs so damn wholesome lol
---
I doubt the player count is going to drop significantly before P2.
---
Its better to do it earlier so players have more time to transfer servers.
---
Just because you can do something doesn‚Äôt mean you should do something. I am well versed in supply and demand. That type of thinking doesn‚Äôt take into account morals or ethics. It‚Äôs still greedy to roll on more then one spec with priority at a time. Just because you rolled a tank doesn‚Äôt entitle you to more loot even if you can strong arm groups into it.
---
Just read his comment history. He‚Äôs a fuckwit.
---
I realize promises got made, but they also get broken and I feel having a firm line at this point sends a message about how the community feels about it. 
---
That said: Why does the transfer need to be IRL paid? There are other mechanics to use that can limit server transfers. It shouldn't be something that makes blizzard profit.
---
I found the lua code to change that texture so probably not hard to hide/disable. I should check the Cvars too
---
that's evil, I prefer a quick drive by dismount blind or just distracting them off the road into mobs. Its more elegant and direct, lets them know their worth is absolutely nothing and its beneath me to even kill them
---
I think it was more of a reaction to the amount of tickets they had to deal with for people ninjaing items...
---
Style points carry it to epic quality
---
It isn't though.
---
I mean... if you want to be casual and get anywhere that is, you can totally just log in and dick around. I suppose if you don't care about seeing all the content you very well can treat the game casually.
---
Correct
---
no blackguard is in phase 4 according to wowhead
---
not sure why its in 4 and all the other weps are in phase 3
---
This is how it worked through all of vanilla on my server....
---
If its too crowded, you can take free server transfers to less crowded realms.
---
Three levels of rolls. First is ms tank and rogue roll against each other. Second is off spec. A tanking item drops and there is a holy paly in the group ms healing items. They both roll against each as an off spec roll. If no one needs for ms or os then you vendor roll.
---
It does require skill up. And it‚Äôs called tipping
---
how does it make less load when it has to process the EXACT SAME number of inbound and outbound packets? Layering was to split players up in order to not overcrowd zones and has 0 effect on capacity.
---
K
---
When someone DMs me for inv and I was spamming "LFG", i tell them: "Sure. If you search for others."  
---
They either inv me, or I can continue searching.  
---
I had one person question me about it.  
---
I usually tell them: "I was looking for a group. Hence, my useage of 'LFG'. If I was trying to lead a group, I'd type 'LFM'."
---
citation needed
---
Did you respond to that message?
---
What the...how??? My son is 3 and he gets mad at my phone trying to look at pictures of ice cream. Is it possible to teach someone this power?
---
My son who did the same thing around that age would run around and he was saying "I have a friend." I looked at the chat log and he was following a rogue around who was saying "stop following me!  What's your deal!!!!?!"  I didn't have the heart to tell him what he was saying.
---
So if you have an annoying person following you, it might be a 3 year old who thinks you're his friend.
---
Later I restricted him to Dalaran (wotlk) before our raid times where he placed a fish feast at a cost of about 15g each at every table in the Alliance Inn.  He was so proud.  I had to keep those in my bank instead.  Eventually my wife saw that he found out you can kill rabbits in Dalaran.  He wasn't allowed to play Wow for many years after that.
---
I mean there is that, I honestly dont know why they removed guild master loot, but I do remember personal being forced on pugs because reserving got out of hand at the end of wod
---
How long will it take on average?
---
Late to they party but I‚Äôm also 56 (just dinged 30 minutes ago actually) and I‚Äôm at 14 days. Shit ton of afk time. I‚Äôd probably say my actual time played is more like 10 days.
---
Wtf he's smart as hell
---
Im a mage i just teleport, fly back then go take a poop while flying
---
Well you just saw how good he is at 3 years old
---
Never wish that life on a child.
---
Thanks, this is useful. I can't wait to put in place a better disambiguation heuristic so that we can start adding all kinds of keywords everywhere, like "cruel".
---
Dafuq do you mean citation needed? Look at the fucking sub.
---
Interesting. What's the addon called?
---
doing the initial turn in in each city(if you have the cloth) at the level you would be getting that cloth is great for EXP
---
I mean, how would they figure out Its a 3 year old?
---
Unless OP told them you would have no clue.
---
Great Guide. By this stage in classic, you would have to find 5 people leveling alts to run spellcleave without pulling your hair out. I was slow with leveling my mage and by October it wasn't even worth it to try anymore. Mages running in to frost nova and dying, blinking into packs, etc. It was so relaxing to finally hit 48 and be able to solo farm Mara.
---
4weird
---
Yep, totally dead server
---
Got two bis items out of MC today, so pretty good overall!
---
Though earlier today I started peeing blood and had to go to the hospital so that wasn't great. But the epics turned it around!
---
I'm similar, two nights of raiding a week (should be down to one + a second Ony in a week or so) and maybe a couple hours trying to farm some preBiS gear here and there. It's not that I don't want to play, it's that I was taking time off work, neglecting my partner and my health trying to keep up the pace with friends to 60. Now I can just run a dungeon here and there, don't need to be permanently playing to still play with friends.
---
Been playing here since day 1 and haven't really noticed those kinds of people.
---
Cairen
---
Yes
---
And Faerlina still has 2 layers.
---
Imagine the queue times once its down to 1.
---
The keyword recognition will only get better. This addon is still in beta, btw; it's far from perfect, but it's already very useful, so I thought "why not."
---
This is hilarious. And I‚Äôm very impressed by how well he uses that computer for his age. Kids gonna be smart
---
Try drain tanking. Your voidwalker just won't be able to hold aggro. Use your imp for blood pact and dark pact. Leveling was a lot faster once I started drain tanking. You will see a nice increase in Nightfall Procs.
---
Literally spending 30 minutes to one hour at the elites in winterspring each day. Not gotten one eye since I reached lvl 59. Time I spend there depends if alliance annoys me or if someone else is farming. Also I use soul stones, so I know how much time I spend there daily.
---
YES! :D
---
Oh look, another three year old! This one isn't as cool, though.
---
Sigh....it‚Äôs called an addon, not a bot.
---
As the 3 year old who put his head through a toilet seat, just to see if it could fit, and then couldn't get it off...
---
Your kid seems pretty above average, keep up the good work!
---
[He's just a really, really, really nice guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24uTb6jEs_g).
---
Context is hard to deliver through messaging boards. I am not trolling you, I meant the statement and link literally. I agree with your criticism.
---
Dailies are inherently bad.  It's when you go insanely overboard that they become cancerous.  
---
The argument that flying kills world pvp or w/e, I don't buy.  World pvp was never a real thing in wow.   Some people try to force it, including blizzard, but it's never been a big part of the game.
---
How is resilience a mistake?  Without Resilience all pvp matches are basically over instantly.  In vanilla you can damn near 1 shot people.  There's not much skill in LB, LB, Chain lightning, ES, dead.
---
I hope so. Questing during peak hours is already almost impossible, and it's not even the most high pop OC server.
---
You act like most warriors keep up battleshout.
---
You think no server will ever die ever, that‚Äôs optimistic
---
HoJ is easily worth 500g+ in value. It's a fury warrior bis until naxx
---
And the dialogue "Hello Champion, chosen one, our savior of the universe, I have a mission for you..."
---
These are used for head and leg enchants and will go up in price by a fair bit in a later phase. Right now i would hold in to them.
---
well, i can make 70g per hour farming, so i have to spend 10 minutes making water to someone, that would be almost 12 gold lost on my part, tipping a few gold is just polite
---
So I‚Äôm starting to save for epic mount, but as a gnome I was wondering if there are any other mounts I‚Äôm eligible for? I don‚Äôt mind the cloth grind.
---
Also Arugal in the OCE region and we already have queues back there.
---
[Puggle](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/puggle) is great and does many things SlashFour doesn't do--and you should use Puggle instead it if you like it better!
---
Sounds like you should play a single player RPG and not an MMO.
---
If it really bothers you, you can lose those people pretty easy if you want to.  
---
Run in a way they get stuck in the terrain, GW/blink/AoC/etc. , take flight path or just AR/HS somewhere else. 
---
Heaps of ways. 
---
You‚Äôre making it sound so much worse than it is.
---
The second one is kinda weird cause you need a lot of crit to make it work
---
Krol blade is a very average item for rogues, inferior to Dal Rends. I'm not donating 300 gold to the rogue so he can vendor it for 6 gold when his Dal Rend drops.
---
The people buying Krol's Blade for 300 gold are level 51.
---
There is NO way the rogue would pay 300 gold for the Krol's Blade on the AH, so they should sell it, just like everyone in the party should, which means it's equally valuable to every player.
---
There is no sl/sl lock build in vanilla.
---
Shadow priests are the best 1v1ers in the game and they beat warlocks.
---
That's what it does!
---
Another thing, your crit/hit/dodge/parry chance all fluctuate a lot based on the level of the mob. So although a mob 2 levels higher than you might still be yellow, it's a low harder to kill than a mob 2 levels lower than you. 
---
Try and stick with things that are lower levels than you and you'll find your life much easier as a warrior. They also have a smaller agro radius.
---
The only issue with backstab is its hard to backstab a mob more than once solo.
---
You made sure he wasn‚Äôt a keyboard turner, you‚Äôre a good dad
---
lol
---
In a month this kid will be all jaded screaming "50 DKP MINUS!" despite his parents never allowing him to watch that old video.
---
Holy shit im impressed. Tell your kid he has sick moves
---
@op your kid has a bright future ahead
---
Maybe when it comes to raiding.  Spriests in the right hands are absolute wrecking balls when it comes to PVP.
---
&gt;And if it vendors for 5g it's worth 5g to a rogue, 5g to a mage, 5g to a warrior. 
---
Tthe item is worth 5g for those who can't use it and far more for those that can use it. 
---
A BoE has equal monetary worth to everyone, because it can be traded for an item of that worth. When a blue BoE drops, then effectively a blue BoE has dropped for everyone, because everyone can trade it in.
---
BRING ME THE POTTY BEFORE I PISS MYSELF
---
Raiding Naxx made me change computer actually. The delay from RAM that I had wasn't exactly OK to heal there.
---
Always had problems in Ironforge before. Was one of the few 60's SW bound. When you did enough Blackrock Mountain from MC to BWL It's OK. And back then we cared way less about losing time.
---
ah ok. I thought you were poking fun at me criticizing the post
---
Nothing comfier than making a little campfire before logging out.
---
Me and my gf are at level 34. Hopefully we get to cap by the end of the year. There is no rush in classic, the game was originally made for casuals.
---
I kited one of those guys to goldshire as a sort of tourist attraction for the lowbies. He murdered the lvl 25 guards and then all of the lvl 4-10 players around whenever I bubbled. 
---
Good times.
---
Yes, except you went out of your way to state it directly and in the most preachy way possible.
---
If you present your opinion as fact instead of just an opinion, it doesn't lend any extra credence to what you're saying.
---
Lmao, harassment. Get some perspective dude.
---
We definitely want to avoid the situation in your first point, where we think we're getting all LFG messages, but some are not getting picked up. I will write about this on the addon page later. As a quick answer, SlashFour reads any and all *channels* that you are *joined to*, like world, LFG, LookingForGroup (yes, those are different), General and, of course, zx98uc785asd1k2. Damn gold sellers.
---
I believe this entire post was just an attempt by OP to farm karma, possibly aiming for silver, gold, platinum. Take an issue that's been beaten harder than the centaur a read headed step child and a dead horse would create, create post with nothing so much as a screen shot to validate circumstance, stir pot. Classic Karma Stew has been learned.
---
Doesn't have to be 2004 for people to do that, it's still happening every day
---
My best speculation is that since it's a spam invite guild it's probably a lot of people around his level
---
Man I tried for that so hard at launch but I gave up a similar experience. Congrats my dude.
---
"i refuse to pay someone more to clean sewers and pick up trash than to bag groceries or wait tables"
---
that's how you get no one cleaning your sewers or picking up your trash
---
it appears you did NOT take economics and actually have no idea what you're talking about
---
What /u/WeRip said :)
---
Any chance you give people gold who he has been following? 5is happened to my husband recently and the guy handed him a gold
---
And now I don't see myself playing anything else anymore...
---
gnomes can ride all the other Alliance mounts, so, have fun.
---
Well after 3 60s you finally found something you like doing with your GF. Or she figured the only way she would get a chance to spend time with you was to play WoW. 
---
This is a fucking weird story not a classic triumph.
---
Aw, poor little baby maybe time to go outside and get mommy to call blizzaard for you :c QQ
---
People aren't literally giving you gold, because that's just stupid. People are giving up the *potential* chance at gold. And rightfully so, because the loot system is intended for immediate upgrades. That's why Need Before Greed was implemented. That's why it's the only rolling option in RDF in later expansions.
---
Also, if you look at the UI, greed shows... guess what? Gold. If you want gold from something, you greed it.
---
Blizzard should just make Need make the item BoP. But they won't, because they'll have thousands of people complaining "#NOCHANGES" at them.
---
Private servers are the new wow classic community. 
---
Never played wow classic.
---
I don't think there's a way to not clip autoshot, due to quiver attack speed.
---
My understanding is you just want to fire your aimed shot IMMEDIATELY after you auto-shot to reduce the clipping as much as you can.
---
Nice. Have you been playing together? I've made the mistake of leveling ahead of my wife who is level 40. Only 5 levels different but makes it a pain to have the same quests and such.
---
On it.
---
There are more than a few others also still layered. 
---
Get this shit off Incendius and let us party!
---
This dude is funny as fuck, he didn't like a comment I made a WEEK AGO and has been stalking me since.
---
&gt; Tthe item is worth 5g for those who can't use it and far more for those that can use it. 
---
This is true of BoEs. If it wasn't then people wouldn't buy them now would they?
---
&gt; A BoE has equal monetary worth to everyone, because it can be traded for an item of that worth. 
---
A BoP has equal monetary worth to everyone, because it can be vendored.
---
&gt; When a blue BoE drops, then effectively a blue BoE has dropped for everyone, because everyone can trade it in.
---
And everyone can trade in a BoP to a vendor.
---
You can't have it both ways. Either it's fine to put monetary value above a players upgrade or it's not.
---
nah just relating to the OP and all its hundreds of upvotes that seem to agree that it is sad you have males that run around acting and posing as females with their avatars in an online role-playing game haha. don't worry it will get more awkward as tech advances to VRMMO level that is indistinguishable from reality and there you are on your female avatar flirting with guys as a male in real life....just ew I hope there is some kind of warning to avoid these catfishing losers.
---
I agree with u, classic is just pve atm and its boring, looking forward to pvp bg aswell
---
From a longer comment further up:
---
&gt;**Some way to configure how long messages are visible** \- I'll look into this. I don't just want to throw a slider somewhere. I would like it to be more useful than that--like say, automatically adjusting the expiration based on chat volume, maybe on a per-dungeon basis, etc.
---
He's terrible and the game and he's an asshole. Why do people group with this twat?
---
Physical dps it's especially important to be higher level due to miss chance and glancing blows being so high against a level 63. But you don't NEED to be 60.
---
If you are unable to understand from context what is and isn't an opinion without someone specifically stating it, that is *entirely* your own problem.

i can't think of a race where male animation is better, undead female is GOAT for rogue cause if you crit on a evicerate you do a flip attack, male nelf attack animation is fucking spastic and holds a sword like he's gonna cut off his head, human male looks ridiculous and hulk esque enough without the 'hold blades to the sides flexing' look, etc. only orcs have a better attack animation for males afaik

People can use bots in everything. Botting wow is nothing compared to what can be automated nowdays.

8 is crazy. I started at 10 and I never played with anyone younger than me until Cataclysm when I was 13. I always was that annoying kid who talked way too much in guild chat, but too afraid to speak in Teamspeak or Vent because of my squeeky voice. The biggest challenge at the time was learning English. Thank god for grammar nazi‚Äôs, they really helped me perfect my English skills and I always was the best in class because of it.

LMAOOOO bro i gotta find a place to post this this is awesome. you are literally mad tha tpeople ruin the potential for wow to be a dating app for your pathetic ass omg dude go meet women in real life or download fucking tinder, wow.

Yep.

You can do "notepad edition" by editing this file:

C:\\Program Files (x86)\\World of Warcraft\\\_classic\_\\Interface\\AddOns\\SlashFour\\Localization\\enGB.lua
---
&gt;This is true of BoEs. If it wasn't then people wouldn't buy them now would they?
---
That's the point - If someone expects to be given a BoE for free when it drops just because they "need" it, but at the same time refuse to cough up the market price for it - then yeah, that would suggest that they do value it less than how the market values it. That in turn begs the question, whether they really "need" that item, of whether there is opportunistic greed at play that allows them to get something far below the current market price. 
---
&gt;A BoP has equal monetary worth to everyone, because it can be vendored.
---
Maybe once it's soulbound, but probably not - would you be willing to delete your current weapons if someone offers to pay you 10gs more than its vendor price to do it? I don't think so. The value furthermore varies prior to its soulbounding - hence why I've seen people offering to pay competing rollers to roll greed, often for pretty high prices. Yet as a rogue, I will never haggle like that over plate items that I can't use, because for me, the value of a BoP of a plate item is fixed, because I can't wear it and I can't AH it.
---
Yeah
---
Was this not possible in vanilla? Hard to separate the memories from vanilla and private servers sometimes.
---
Speak for yourself, I‚Äôve got one nearly leveled and the gear is waiting in the bank. Get it while it‚Äôs cheap, I say!
---
When the whole server can fit into one capitol
---
Yeah the first half was awful but the second half with the raid stuff was good.
---
But please only if you're horde :P
---
Let me preface this by saying I am enjoying classic. It's nice having a game to come home to and play for a few hours at a time and just do whatever I want, and think about the game and aspects of it at work and looking forward to playing it again etc. Haven't had that since wrath/cata era.
---
Having said that, 'Classic' WoW is not Vanilla and never will be. You can change the game (from retail) but you can't change the people. Sadly.
---
The vast majority of people I've encountered in classic are ex-retail players that are stuck in their ways. Only play with guildmates, don't talk to each other in pug groups unless they are barking orders, everyone knows everything and is constantly judging others, most people don't want to help anyone unless it's for their benefit, join groups to do a quest and leave immediately once they are done with their part, etc etc. It just seems to be a huge race to 60.
---
Everyone is all about 'farming' and 'grinding' rather than just enjoying the game. Farming/grinding are not fun.
---
I dunno, maybe it's just my experience. But for me, back in Vanilla, you would come across someone, start talking and questing a bit, then you add them and the next day you're both joining up again and so on. I'm not getting that this time around. Someone just sends you a group invite with no context, you both kill things in the same general vicinity, and then they leave without a word, never to be heard of again lol.
---
Seems as though if you weren't in an active guild throughout retail and know all these people beforehand (like me, haven't played since cata), classic can be a lonely place.
---
Now there will be a 15 minute stream rage about the horrible people on reddit. 
---
Hi chat.
---
Got a rogue to 50 because I had a mind to stealth mine and PvP on it but lost focus as the class lacks depth/is one dimensional. Considering a hunter but tbh I‚Äôd rather just fish or herb or dme jump run for 100 hours and make gold than level another char.
---
My friends/guildies know that even if a BIS item dropped, we should still 'share' the value, by either rolling for chance or splitting the value. It makes no sense that you wouldn't give your friend 100g randomly, but it's cool when a specific BOE drops that you'd happily forgo the gold. Why didn't you just hop onto the AH, buy the BoE and mail it to them already?
---
For example we were in a group and Krol's Blade dropped, the rogue initiated with "all need" and we all rolled, he gz'd the winner. I asked him if he wanted it cheap and he said it's not worth it, and to sell it obviously. Naturally he was right.
---
Wow dude you are the fucking man! Thank you so much for all the tips!!! You the best.
---
Server is great and has a strong alliance raiding scene. Its one of the servers that is large and quite fun. But, its still early if you want to reroll. Just avoid willingly ninjalooters.
---
Yes, SlashFour parses chat messages and looks for pre-defined keywords.
---
I shamingly do this going back and forth between Eastvale Logging Camp and Goldshire. It's not THAT far but...
---
DONT PRETEND YOU HAVENT THOUGHT ABOUT IT TOO
---
Here was my son when Neverwinter came out  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXun145OgOY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXun145OgOY)
---
Obviously.
---
You're right, which is why all need is the default.
---
If someone accidentally presses greed, let em roll off.
---
Two ways this is gonna end, but either way I'm going out critin'
---
Sowwy, u can not have the loot...that is foe‚Äô my fwend
---
*gkick
---
This explains so many paladins...
---
reddit is seriously deteriorating, it used to be people would only read title now they just are taking a fraction of that. gonna have to start communicating solely ni picture form soon
---
I have no problems at all with good druids. They're doing really more fine than I expected.
---
I don't get this meme
---
Fellow priest here. Once you get around 400+ healing, PI spec becomes viable. You might enjoy that aspect of disc priest! Good luck to you
---
i expected them cus i was a dick about it, but i guess not!
---
Buddy again.. you can't have it both ways. Either it's fine to roll need on EVERYTHING because it can be used to buy other gear, or you allow people who can use the items first go at them. 
---
Just because you can sell a BoE for more than a BoP that means nothing. And quite frankly I'm done with this argument. Every single response is the same thing.. trying to justify why you should take items from people who can actually use them so they can what? Take a different item from someone else and sell it so they can buy the original one back? Come on.
---
You will get plenty of BoE's and shit to sell without being a dick about it and stealing from other players.
---
Because it doesn't solve the problem at all.
---
It turns into a prisoners dilemma, where the right decision is "all greed" but someone can still be an idiot and need the drop, destroying its value.
---
Also if someone mistakenly needs the item, there's no opportunity to trade it.
---
&gt;What part of the video is from Tips again?
---
The video is called how not to raid lead. Tips is the raid leader. A large portion of the video is Tips audio clips.
---
my daughter is 2 years old and I cannot wait to get her into games
---
I actually ran quite a lot to get Dal'Rends, and I quite often made groups where I was the only one needing the main hand.  
---
I must have run it 20 times in full guild before going for randoms. I never saw the main hand but I got everything else.  
---
So when I had to play with randoms, I simply stated that. We did Jed for casters, Gith for tanks (when I wasn't tanking) and Rend for head, wrists, offhand for the other DPS. Was always alone on the main hand.  
---
I don't know where this guy is coming from. The "spirit of the game" was always kind of "hardcore gaming" and optimizing for some people. Even back then, it was a "tryhard" game for HL content guild. I know some people were more casual, but let's not pretend Vanilla wasn't also a sweaty nerds things. I remember vividly the internet cafe I was going to. Filled with guys that were switching from DAoC to WoW and were raiding all the time.  
---
Anyway, it's stupid af crying over "reservations" when it's done in advance and in a fair way to everyone (ie: everybody gets a chance at something in the run)
---
I'm going off the exact info OP provided.  He stated that he taught his son how to follow people, eventually built a macro for it, and showed us a screenshot of the GM addressing it after getting complaints.
---
Don't get me wrong, I was laughing my ass off watching the video.  It's cute &amp; funny.  
---
Bottom line though is that players asked him to stop, they didn't get a response, he kept doing it, and they got pissed off enough to complain to the guild leader.  
---
I'm not 'making it sound worse', these are just the unfortunate facts on the other side.  
---
Now in context to this thread, I'm responding to a potential reaction to the suggestion of an autoresponse "Sorry, my 3 year old is playing" or whatever it was.  I simply questioned whether it was a TOS violation.  With all the above mentioned going on, I could imagine a scenario where someone would report a 3 year old.  
---
You guys think I'm crazy and over reacting, but I'm telling you there's a reason that GM is whispering him.  I don't have to have this happen to me in order to understand why that might happen.  It's funny on the outside, but probably annoying as hell after it stops being funny (when it's happening to you).
---
Pretty much
---
This feature is actually already in the addon, but disabled, because I didn't like it. It's a little hard to explain what I didnt like with it, though.
---
If you just want to look up what the level of a dungeon is, including having it color-coded to your character, then just open the drop down menu and mouseover the dungeon you are wondering about. That will show you a tooltip with exactly this info :)
---
Retail has no rolling, you just pick up your loot.
---
If you come across a BoE epic, it only dropped for you. (It's also likely your armour class etc.)
---
You get to sell it, or you can equip it, entirely up to you.
---
Interfaces are one of those things, like language, where you can learn them really quick when you're young and with immense pain and frustration and false starts when you're old.
---
Why is this posted every day? You don't have to justify to us why you're not 60. Just play the game.
---
I had a mage refuse my 20s tip. Like bitch I don't get free money for doing nothing!
---
Single layer is now active

https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/layered-realms-update-oct-22/340582
---
Ofc the run it drops for me the druid tank says "im rolling for it" xdxdxd needless to say I lost roll. It's the solo life for me from here on.
---
Impale/Prot?  Not really, it's a pretty standard tank build, actually good for dungeon farming as well if you decide to switch to Prot after level 50.
---
Edit:  I would take a point out of Parry and Anger Management and get 2/2 Improved Overpower for dungeon tanking, but stance dancing for an Overpower is not something I would do as a MT in a raid.
---
I just lvled my alts alch to 300 keep in mind I had a ton of herbs and still spent about 150g with most mars up to 200 in my bank already
---
*Smh*
---
And that have what to do with streamers?
---
For pve? For pvp?
---
I know me who couldn't play like this 3 year old.
---
I always yell all need ASAP glad you had a good experience
---
Happened to me today, but mage at least had the decency to hide behind the bookcase...
---
For information's sake I timed my average corpse run, it's only a few seconds faster than talented vanish. It's usually worth to sit out the timer before you start picking pockets again. I get resists constantly, it really cuts into profits.
---
As for the dreaded triple resist, yeah it happens all the fucking time. You figure in an 8 minute loop of the upper ring and highway you're picking about 200 pockets, several 1% chances are likely.
---
Your guild is wrong and its all your fault, if I would have been that paladin and I would win a legendary because you didnt care to find a solution on who is getting it first and than you tell me its just a prank bro you will never get the second item now because we will give it to our tank -&gt; I would instantly leave too.
---
I hope the paladin finds a better guild now.
---
Never wish that life on anyone. 
---
Sincerely: a long time healer main
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree more and shared my similar story just recently here but I succumbed to the bitching and don‚Äôt have my item. Good for you keeping them. I wish I had.
---
Well at least wow is teaching people that listening to dumb groupthink is bad and detrimental to your success.
---
Sulfuras was created on day 2 so its unusual. its an overflow server.
---
I see where you're coming from but I think it's reasonable to argue that someone who can't equip it needs the gold to buy something. The argument is for sure in favor of the person who can equip it, but it is still a bit of a grey area that will depend on the majority decision of the group. Now if the group decides it should go to the person who can equip it but someone else still rolls need for gold, that's definitely a dick move.
---
Bro wtf he's better than most of my guildies....
---
Train that kid, with this level of mechanical skill and awareness at three he's gonna be making bank gaming in 12-15 years. By then gamers might even be making as much as pro athletes (crazy that with fortnite, some already do...)
---
Why is your monitor so high up? I can already feel my neck hurting like hell.
---
A monitor is supposed to be below your eye level, let alone far above! It‚Äôs like Watching a movie from the first row in class. Hello pain!
---
"It makes no sense that you wouldn't give your friend 100g randomly, but it's cool when a specific BOE drops that you'd happily forgo the gold."  
---
I completely understand what you mean but you're neglecting loss aversion which is a huge thing for people. It's much more palatable to not get 100g than it is to lose 100g. And like it's the fucking BOIS, and it's hype to get us balling out. We try to kinda balance things out internally with drops and helping each other out and whatnot but it's not a strict thing.
---
At honored you get a 10% discount
---
Reserves are hilarious.  Even if I don't need the item I don't feel like tanking those because of the mindset.
---
By contrast I'm more likely to run with decent players until everyone gets what they want, but if you're reserving things you're not in that frame of mind.  If there is not a lockout, there isn't a reason for it.
---
From another comment:
---
&gt;This is my next big focus for the addon: Extensive &amp; easy customizing of keywords (which includes localization), and I'm taking inspiration from [Puggle](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/puggle) and [Group Bulletin Board](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/group-bulletin-board), which already do this very well.
---
And from yet another comment:
---
&gt;You can manually edit keywords by editing this file:  
---
Hope that helps! :)
---
Have we forgotten the old ways of blacklisting a jackass and telling everyone they're a ninja?

I guess 10+ years of never seeing any repercussions will do that.

I find it equally as funny that you a male enjoy role playing as a female LMAOOOO

I guess it's okay cause that must mean you are transgender in real life, that must be a lot of explaining you have to do when you meet someone in a online dating app, game, or real life LOLOL
---
I almost forgot about that video. Thanks for the reminder to watch it again, now the gf gets to enjoy it.
---
Why aren't you just buying these upgrades on the AH then?
---
Because they are worth more in gold, i.e. you're not willing to pay for them.
---
Why are you suddenly willing to equip the item just because you haven't sold it yet?
---
Nice! Lol kinda sucks when you are on auto pilot and miss loot.
---
Had an epic necklace drop in lbrs, everyone needed no drama. It was a caster necklace and luckily a caster won it but a BOE drop? That's a bag of gold that just dropped, everyone roll need.
---
This is a game. It‚Äôs for fun. It‚Äôs not a job. If there was 0 loot in the game would you still want to run dungeons? Because I would. If you treat this game like a job we have radically different views on how to spend free time.
---
Apologies if this bug was already reported/this is what the curseforge page means by "Still not using smart message trimming", but if someone *changes* what dungeon they're advertising for, they still show up in any dungeon categories their previous message(s) were in with the updated message.
---
I.E., I advertise "LFG RFD or SM Cath", I show up in both categories. I end up starting an RFD group and say "LFM RFD" shortly thereafter. Now it shows "LFM RFD" in the SM Cath category.
---
(Also would happen if I was initially doing "LFG SM Cath", then changed my mind and started saying "LFG RFD"- "LFG RFD" would be in both RFD &amp; Cath categories. Not sure if it should show the last *relevant* message- I.E., SM Cath would still show me saying "LFG SM Cath" even after I say "LFG RFD"- or if it should clear me from any categories that my latest message doesn't apply for. I'd probably prefer the latter.)
---
Go fuck off
---
I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre fixing Solenar, but it stinks that they have to change all mobs. You could definitely split a group in Vanilla by kiting and only damaging one mob until the others reset.
---
Uhh whitemane, which is bigger than both of the ones you mentioned.
---
Still..go Fuck off
---
You tank you lead. You're a Warrior doing 5's you tank. You want to DPS in 5's or UBRS as a warrior ? Better have a guild.
---
3 rules there, overdid it mb.
---
Unless the recipe holders form a cartel.
---
This looks fantastic!  Any way you can filter too? Like if someone says "reserved" it can just not display it, or better yet throw them on ignore?
---
eye on resewve
---
I used to run AV for my older brother when I was 11. When I first started he told me to just stand there and jump around to not let him go AFK. Once I had been playing WoW for a few months on my own character (NE Huntard), he let me actually participate in AV and told me to press 1, 2,3, and 4 in that order anytime I went into combat (it was fear then 3 dots, can't remember the Dot order for locks).
---
I also used to wake up early on the weekends to be able to play before he woke up and kicked me off. I would get a good 10 hours each weekend (7am to 12pm both days), but I wouldn't be able to play during the week because he got home before me and stayed up Waaaayyyyy longer than me.
---
Who is Jamie?
---
What if the community wants classic+ in a couple years not TBC? Legit dumb
---
I'm gonna back this by saying that lockpicking is a skill that needs to be leveled up... Just like fishing, weapon skills, etc. It takes time to get to the level required to open certain lockboxes. Rogues can't just go buy a reagent and do it.
---
I have vendored a heap of these masks on various toons.
---
I thought it was a fairly common drop.
---
Nope, it has a pretty bad distance between AH and  the bank compared to IF and SW.
---
I have been using Puggle, but I was just wondering if this offered any additional or different things. I'm always happy to try out new addons, I just wanted to ask about Puggle vs SlashFour
---
Short answer : Never.
---
All servers still say layered, but judging by the queue and huge increase of people in game, it has been removed
---
Also not too far a flight to kargath/ thorium point which is where you'll spend most of your time 60.
---
Best do that... most of the time it's just account phishing, sometimes it can be links to malware that logs your PCs actions.
---
Priest t2 is dope af
---
Good catch.
---
The reason it is like this, is that, internally, SlashFour doesn't really show *messages* (well of course it does, but stick with me), but *players*, and a player is categorized by *all* of their recent messages.
---
Part of the reason it's like this is because SlashFour supports way more than just LFG and parsing messages for dungeons. It can recognize and tag anything, and even recognizes a few things that are not yet shown in the interface, like professions and trades. So players need to be able to show up in many places at the same time; maybe one message was about LFG, maybe another was about looking for a crafter, etc.
---
What you have noticed is an interesting problem that I will have to think a little about how to solve in the best way possible. I'm glad you also told me what you would prefer--that helps me think about the issue. Thanks!
---
Has anyone ever tried to bop main tank in phase 1 ensuring off tank is 2 nd on omen threat meter with the goal being to feed the off tank more rage so that both tanks out threat any casters in P2?
---
Dungeon specific or lvl range LFG channel would solve all. And this is basically it.
---
That‚Äôs funny, played since classic and it‚Äôs always been Need over greed in any group I have played in
---
The economy of greens vs blues/purples isn‚Äôt what we are talking about. We are discussing how you always need over greed so there is no ninjaing.
---
And you talk about morals, that‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt need every green. Everyone agrees you need on expensive BoEs. You are in the very low minority
---
I can't play male nelfs because of the ears bouncing up and down while running.
---
Is there another way to do it
---
Because they pay for however many extra accounts they‚Äôre using.
---
*Moneymoneymoneymonnnney....MAAAAHNEY!*
---
Second this. Kromkrush
---
EVERYBODY WOLL GWEED PLEEZ
---
He/she paying for the account, boxing has existed since vanilla so doubt it will be gone
---
And requires 330 to even be able to cast your line.
---
People just kept repeating that as if it was true, turns out it wasnt.
---
Nothing stops people from making such an arrangement if they want.
---
Whitemane and Fairbanks are still layered. Hell, whitemane has a 2+ hour queue just today
---
I am only playing classic, because I want TBC.  TBC is OBJECTIVELY a much better game.
---
I 100% agree with this. An upgrade? Go for it, just make sure you chuck that bad boy on!
---
Agility on cloth.  That's par for the course on blizzard sets.  I still remember caster sets with ag in the cloth gloves.
---
Damn were they sleeping on the sets at launch.
---
It‚Äôs glorious
---
Fuck off
---
*dwarf pally crying noises*
---
You've always been able to multibox it you are willing to pay for the additional accounts and subscriptions. I saw someone doing 4 simultaneous chars earlier today in silverpine
---
All pve servers will be more ally, all pvp servers horde. Stick with that and you'll be fine.
---
Run. Stop, adjust headings on mouse. Run. Stop, adjust headings on mouse.
---
Absolutely. As I joke, I have a hidden "Idiot" tag, which gets applied to messages that contain "layer". Hahah! But don't worry, it doesn't actually *do* anything (like, it doesn't hide the message). But this is the functionality you want, and it will be part of the next version:
---
i know that there's an allicance questline there but i didn't come across any for horde. 
---
If you have time, check:

best i could do
---
Wow. I didn't know there was a follow button. I feel...not smart.
---
He is a clown. It's why he hosts the duel tournaments, because he's completely out of his league when it comes to participating in them, unless he's funneled all his raid's gear to himself. 
---
(Not to toot his horn or anything, but he's a pretty good warrior dueler. Not many NA warrior duelers can go toe-to-toe with him) .... LUL.
---
He's screeching at his raid members and by the looks of it pressuring a lot of them to completely min/max for what is objectively the easiest raid in the game's history, and to what end? They aren't in the top 5, so they're effectively irrelevant. What's the over/under on how many of them in there now will be running with them into BWL? AQ? Naxx? Doesn't sound like any of them are friends. Just coworkers.
---
No
---
It‚Äôs not true love unless you let them stab you with a fishing pole so they could catch fish.
---
I disagree with you that tanks make the rules. However in the group if it isn't stated... if it's an upgrade then take it. Especially if you equip it after the combat ends.
---
No, as long as it doesn't cross over into botting.
---
lmfaoooo this is gold keep going
---
holy shit frame perfect turns. god damn
---
sounds like the dps out-gear you and they aren't bothering to wait.
---
tell them to back the fuck off 
---
but nicely XD
---
I have a guildy who is new to the game, they rushed to 60 to catch up to their partner and I rushed to 60 to catch up to the raid team. 
---
Towards the end we were around the same level and found out we liked leveling together. 
---
And now leveling alts together I am totally appreciating the alt experience 10x more with them than someone who knows everything and wants to do everything efficiently or perfectly. 
---
It's also nice that my random knowledge can be helpful, but we CAN waste time, I dont feel pressured. 
---
Plus we are leveling a druid tank (me) and a priest healer (them) so we legit get do whatever we want. Any quests we want, any dungeons we want. We control the group's and thr flow, its great.
---
I agree with you. I shouldn't have to go out of my damn way to get this shit to stop, and if I'm doing a quest that requires NOT killing the enemy, and this shit happens... I'd be a bit angry. No. Just no. 
---
Just me: kids playing video games, okay whatever, idgaf. Kids playing games that also affect others, no. It's the decision of the parents to allow it, but dont be surprised when whispers like that happen and people dont find it "cute".
---
There's a long grind ahead.
---
I know this actually, but my keyboard can't do this and I'm lazy
---
Dutch is weird too!
---
If anything, the classic+ crowd seem to be the minority.  Even if the majority wanted classic+ though, it still wouldn't happen over tbc.   They would perhaps rethink doing TBC classic though.
---
A bird in the hand is worth 2 in the bush.
---
Oh I definitely do.
---
So I play on Yojamba from New Zealand, will we still have layering then?
---
I've literally never had any issue with it that couldn't be fixed with a /reload. Nothing gamebreaking either.
---
Lol you don‚Äôt go 31/0/20 for mana, you go because it‚Äôs way more damage, the mana is just a perk.
---
That is awesome. I have 3 boys, 1, 2, &amp; 5. Avoided trying to teach the 5 year old WoW because I figured the necessary reading would be a problem, but maybe I should let him give it a try.
---
The zones were also more linear, a lot less bs going back and forth carrying letters.  The quests were also a lot better.  In classic wow 98% of the quests are the same.
---
Does the child actually own the account by paying the monthly subscription and clicking agree on the TOS? I‚Äôm pretty sure the parent pays and ‚Äúowns‚Äù the child‚Äôs account.
---
Why do I feel like punting a kid
---
An angel
---
How do you know that?
---
Actually op's made a few comments saying the kid clicks on those gold channel popups.
---
So... yeah?
---
Got any other witty one liners champion?
---
I want to say PvP because that's the main thing introduced in P2
---
Cheaper for sure, but definitely not affordable.
---
Ahaha I think if it's truly BIS, the item would be pain to sell and it's not a large amount, totally giving it away.
---
But I don't expect to be funnelled righteous orbs whilst running strat live as a priest.
---
As a very (*very*) short reply:
---
[ClassicLFG](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classiclfg)'s approach revolves around *groups, roles and invites*. SlashFour is just about *chat*.
---
[Puggle](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/puggle) &amp; SlashFour are very similar, but realized in different ways. And Puggle now has many other cool features that SlashFour will never have, like group &amp; player history.
---
I also enourage you to check out [Group Bulletin Board](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/group-bulletin-board), which I like a lot.
---
In the end: **Choose whichever you prefer!**
---
You are incredibly hilarious!
---
41 warrior. I resonate with this a lot.
---
I had Southshore for my hearth on my first character for the longest time. Quick to Northern EK zones, menethil harbor to middle of Kalimdor and the top end. STV was usually a long trip anyway.
---
Im assumind the same cause thats usually what conflag is all about but OP doesn't say
---
Don't forget to breathe out once in a while.
---
Don't kink shame.
---
I have an enhance shaman. I roll on shields, but I always ask the tank first.
---
What even goes on in those channels?
---
Can I buy stock in your company? I've been looking for something that I can use to keep track of people that say or do dumb things.
---
With LFG channels always open something that parses text and adds tags to people that use it to talk or soap box would be nice, I have no idea how big ignore lists can be, and I have zero desire to assist them gear!  
---
I love the future.
---
It depends on faction and race. Horde:
---
as a caster pick Undead Male, they have the best casting animation; not female, weird animation (especially running) and voice is terrible. but keep in mind that female Undead has somersault animation for some of special attacks (for rogues it's eviscerate).  
---
Melee class Tauren Male! You gonna have biggest weapon and coolest dancing emote. Female model  looks weird.
---
Or pick Orc Male, oversized shoulder gear. (same size as taurens though, but orcs much smaller). Female doesn't have oversized shoulder gear.
---
Trolls, both look horrible, but probably Female is better, at least you can tell whether your char is sitting or standing. 
---
Alliance:
---
Humans have oversized weapon, the size of it is the same as for NE. Female Human are smaller and weapon looks even bigger. Melee class -&gt; Female Human. But Human Female has weird face animation which doesn't change even in combat, she keeps smiling and her eyes moving from side to side, which is a bit unsettling. 
---
Gnomes - if you like pissing people off, with their nasty laughter go for Male one - definitely, the worst laughter in the gaming history. Gnomes has oversized head gear piece, if you want to roleplay as big helm with no legs or hands, you should play as a gnome warrior. I don't think there is much difference between male and female in terms of sizes but I can be mistaken, never played as a Gnome. 
---
Dwarves - hilarious running animation for Male, quite distinctive animation for one handed melee special attack.  Cool wind blowing casting animation for Female. I think it's the only one such animation in the game. 
---
Night Elves - Male one is goofy and has dangling ears, weird casting animations. Female one is graceful, elegant, and on top of that has the best animation for firing a gun, just look at her face closely. Both genders do somersault for jumping.  
---
In conclusion, it makes sense why people pick female character for Alliance, NE and Human are most popular and for both of them Female chars animation are more superior. For Horde, unless you are playing as a troll for some reason, there is no logical reason to pick a female character, unless you are roleplaying female character.
---
I saw ‚Äúonyxia guild run looking for tank‚Äù.. I was like so you guild doesn‚Äôt have a tank? RIP lol
---
33 here...goin slow and I‚Äôve fallen behind the curve so leveling seems to be with people that are on there second or third character and it‚Äôs not as much fun...so I‚Äôve been soloing for a while
---
No it should not wtf
---
&gt;Everyone can benefit from a BOP because its worth vendor money. YAYY everyone needs.
---
There is no equal utility for BoP-s, because the people that can wear the BoP get more value from it than people that can't. You can clearly see the absurdity of someone suggesting that Thunderfury is worth 4g to warriors, simply because that is its approximate vendor price. 
---
With BoE-s, people do get equal value from it, because it's tradeable for another BoE of equal worth.
---
Wow! My kid is bad with the mouse, but he hasn't had much practice.  He does amazing in BoTW...little dude goes around smacking around Hinoxes and Taluses.  He's not quite there for the Lynex bastards thought.
---
Has a lot to do with free server transfers. Skeram has had three rounds, combined with the census data that showed it started out heavily horde skewed. Seeing this, many alliance transferred off, only compounding the problem. For example, Alliance currently has no one who can craft Lionheart Helm since the player who had it and their guild transferred off. Judging from what I see day-to-day out in the world, I wouldn't be surprised if it was 4 or 5:1 H:A ratio at this point.
---
it's great if you are in a cutting-edge guild and are the only person w/ it.
---
otherwise it's pointless. 
---
it has some flavour and they improved it in expacs but for vanilla, just pick up something else and buy/farm the mats for the items you want/need.
---
Similar to being in a relationship you dont want to be in. When you know what you want, and that relationship is not it.... ha ha ha
---
Talk to an innkeeper. Choose "Trick or Treat". It will apply a debuff that will reset every hour, giving you either a straight transformation, a candy bar, a mask, or a bag with a 5-charge item that you can use to transform people (does not work on yourself sadly).
---
which video is this?
---
ow, and a lil worm as bait
---
This is the cutest thing ever
---
Best way to test is let a hunter pet get it then dismiss them. Then heath to town and bring out the pet.
---
&gt; play a game or two of OW 
---
No idea what this is but I'm imagining a game involving slapping one another.
---
Haha, be careful what you wish for. My Patreon link is on the addon page ;) Haha :D
---
(I leveled a priest to the 40 and realized it wasnt what I wanted.)  
---
Now I'm playing a hunter and I love it :)
---
I just laugh at the idiots who have that mentality. If I need it in rolling need fuck them
---
This glorious Onyxia raid: https://youtu.be/HtvIYRrgZ04
---
&gt; Alliance currently has no one who can craft Lionheart Helm since the player who had it and their guild transferred off.
---
Oof.
---
My sorry ass tanked with Thekals grasp until BC
---
I would hold my hand over his hand on the mouse and move it around. I think this helped him catch on quick!
---
 Nope, it was introduced in wrath
---
PRICES WILL GO UP FOR MATS. HODL !!!!!! TO THE MOON !!!!!!!! 19K AND BEYOND
---
It's certainly just nostalgia
---
I'm on Skeram Alliance and Ironforge has very few people. The server is too heavily one sided.
---
Skipping 5 min is a big deal. But skipping like one pack or something is what most peoole actually end up trying to do, then wiping
---
I just exit program and usually im alive once i relog
---
to give a perfect example of why he is a piece of shit and a moron, he ninja'd [Mark of the Dragon Lord](https://classicdb.ch/?item=13143) from his own guildie healer "because it has a 500 absorb"
---
Stop from AFKing in the city? You‚Äôre so hard done by!
---
You think server transfers have nothing to do with this?
---
J Allen Brack: "You think you do but you don't."
---
\*looks at this screenshot\*
---
J Allen Brack: "I'll see myself out."
---
Not to burst your bubble or anything man, but you can't transfers characters to accounts in another person's name. I took over a friend's brothers RAF account after his brother got bored of the game but they paid to upgrade it all, when I tried to send a character to myself a GM told be about a policy blizzard have to prevent people stealing accounts and sending off the characters on it.
---
&gt;If a person has a problem playing a female character, by extension they should also have a problem playing every race other than humans and dwarves.
---
I think, that's the reason why human race (mostly male) is heavily popular in WoW.
---
U realize that the same amount of players can play just without layers
---
Alliance is almost universally agreed upon as better in group pvp in Vanilla. Alliance is better from a completion standpoint in terms of PvE, but Horde is a bit better at speedclearing. I think the largest factor is that Horde has much stronger PvP racials that make solo play quite a bit more fun. As someone playing alliance warlock now, I greatly miss being an Orc with stun resist that didn't have to deal with WotF
---
In this case, for 5g, sure. But if that person equips that 700g piece when hes gonna outlevel it in a few days... It makes me so sad at the possibilities lost, for both me and that person. Its like finding one of those never-opened toys from the 20s that are worth a fortune, and then playing with it in a muddy sand box.
---
No wonder I couldn‚Äôt log on
---
You sure? Prat did this but doesn't anymore as long as you not shift click the people
---
Where u get it to drop?
---
I wasn't expecting so many people to have a hard time understanding how this could impact other players.  Thanks for restoring a little hope lol
---
yeah, definitely not because of the 10+ horde 60s just running around ganking lowbies all the time in hillsbrad...
---
gross. you don't want to go to lower pop servers. do u wanna be lonely? cus thats how ull be lonely
---
Not a word on MC shenanigans? Aim for the lowest fruit, don't start mid tree!  VE isn't going to heal the entire raid on it's own, but if you're stacking SW for locks anyways VE too, or you get no reason to yell at resto druids for spacing FF, assuming you don't bring at least one feral.
---
All gnomes except warriors are kill on sight
---
it wont forever, eventually people will start to get annoyed and they'll stop making it. and the more mages that stop, the more peopletthat are funneld into the smaller group til eventually someone wises up and raises the price.
---
I'm alliance on this realm, it's a depressing nightmare here
---
Yeah, that's an interesting hierarchy to have to deal with. In the case of "SlashTwo" functionality for trade, I'd probably want to keep the latest for every category, as opposed to the one latest message.
---
Put the skull on mob, usually DPS's will pop their cheap shot, frost nova, snare shot at the start. If It's not dead when it reaches them, just Taunt.
---
Some mobs will one shot your clothies, It's a bad idea to let a 20%+ mob wander. Difference between a good but lazy tank and an actually really good tank in 5's.
---
Position your pack on the skull path so when it goes towards the ranged you just have to pick it fast and you don't move/take hits from the back/lose GCD's by running around, the Taunt time will be enough for them to blow it up.
---
Rushing later phases won't affect your ability to play the game as slow as you want. This is a red herring.
---
10/10 not what I expected
---
There is a crafter. Charging 300g. OP is a phony
---
"slippery slope" is all i get. runescape has all these character changes "in-game" with literal in-game barber shops/makover mages and require "in-game" currency to commit to them. I have a feeling people arent a fan because they know blizzards methods of character changes, which i would definitely would agree is a slippery slope.
---
Maybe they'll add it if they do Classic plus.
---
I rolled mage for this reason
---
And as we know, nobody on alliance has ever ganked anyone
---
Never greed on BoE epics. Always roll need. If you win, you can stick to your morals and give it to the one player who actually wants to wear it. Or you can sell it on the AH, but nobody can ninja it away from you.
---
Everyone should always roll need on such items. You can decide what to do with the item after the roll, but at least make sure that you can‚Äôt get fucked over by a ninja
---
U sure bout that
---
Yeah thats hard when youre already 54. Think you can learn to like it? I went troll and now i wish i went orc because they look badass. But ive come accustom to his appearance:)
---
Cool, now show me the empty Stormwind and Ironforge
---
&gt; If there was 0 loot in the game would you still want to run dungeons?
---
nope
---
&gt;If you treat this game like a job
---
that's what i'm saying. tanking IS a job, which is why there's so few that do it "for fun"
---
I honestly do not know how that ended up on this thread lol
---
yes i have about 100 shit flasks and 1 master flask LiSTeN UP bOi 21 Million club# gold
---
Whitemane too.
---
Druids like +healing to their HoTs. If you think healer needs only spirit I must dissapoint you.
---
I‚Äôve been watching him for a while, he doesn‚Äôt seem to be like that. A couple days ago they did their first guild raid on Rag and he was just another member of the guild. I don‚Äôt doubt that there are streamers out there who are like you describe, but you should check out LobosJr on Twitch
---
Just wanted to tell a short story of the biggest WTF I've experienced so far.
---
Making my way back from BRD to hand in a quest, a group runs the opposite way with some elites tailing them. I get in combat as I run by, no biggie. But as I make my way out of BRM and all the way to the quest giver, I'm still in combat. Can't even mount so I have to walk on foot. Searched for this issue, it suggested a reload, which I did. As I reloaded, an elite anvilrage footman or whatever their name is popped up on top of me and started attacking. So I decided to see if it would deaggro, nope 5 of running around burning steppes (without touching it) and it's still chasing me. I figured I'd take it to a city for laughs, but another 5 minutes and it just disappeared into thin air.
---
What's up with that :D
---
If you think tanking is a job you are doing it wrong.
---
Man we are no changes in stuff that forces  you to use it like a big lfg addon spy doesn't really matter
---
Hey don't tempt me, I may be a student but tax season should be nice to me this year!
---
It's free as long as you say please.
---
it makes sense, its still hilarious to see a warrior in all leather
---
As a Tauren Druid I throw people buffs and heals when running past.
---
Also if I see any lowbies in general chat complaining about being ganked I have to help my horde brothers and sisters.
---
Not on Skeram, but that‚Äôs probably why I had a queue for the first time in weeks. They must have finally removed the second layer from most servers
---
Nice
---
I‚Äôve always wanted that staff lol. I saw the fiery waraxe drop in Cath. Guildee won it and ended up giving it to my brother who‚Äôs a ret Paladin. We even put fiery on it cuz it‚Äôs classic lol.
---
I don't know, maybe you have to be at full bar. I had the same problem with alchemy. I couldn't train the 75-150 step. it wasn't even visible under the unavailable flag until I had 75 skill.
---
&gt; can't put off responsibilities anymore
---
Fucking casuals.
---
As I understand it, they don't go nuts and attack everyone nearby once the Enslave Demon wears off. They *used* to, so you'd have a warlock casting it, releasing the Infernal, and then running off giggling as it went berserk on everything nearby. Guess they figured that would be bad somehow. Dunno why. Instead it locks threat to the summoner and rushes straight to them, or despawns if they're not around.
---
Shit I hope they do Classic+
---
They won't aggro friendly players when the command demon duration ends.
---
You're 45 and don't think you will reach 60? I'm 43 and think I'll do it by the end of November. I believe level 41 is the point where you are halfway there as far as xp goes.
---
Yeah I thought the same thing for the first half, it took a bit but I'm glad I stayed to watch the second half.
---
Or you roll on the best server zandalar tribe eu combining the best of both worlds #ad
---
Still expensive af though.  Arcane crystals alone are going for 70+g a pop right now... I blame the ah bots and resource mafias
---
I completely agree with you, that if it's an upgrade, you need it, so click need. However, that being said I do think there is a certain element of "needing" an item if it sells for a considerable amount of gold. I would argue that we all "need" that lvl 40 mount more than you will need an upgrade that is obsolete in two levels, so for some items I do believe a group decision to all greed or need is OK aswell. Only for expensive items though (&lt;50g), not some 7g blue BoE.
---
Y'all should come to Heartseeker. There are only 4 guilds who have completed MC on horde. And my guild master is a piece of shit who took 3 items for himself today after "loot counsel". HELP
---
Y my pp hard
---
Yeah thats why we have .com
---
this so i wait until they sit to drink and i do it quick lol
---
I mean in the article says it was one of the servers that layering was removed so no?
---
they can either pay the mage or buy the argent water for 2g+ per stack.
---
spending 1g per 2 stacks of temp water is cheap as shit compared to spending almost 5g for 2 stacks of the argent dawn water.
---
not only that, as someone already said. making a bunch of water can take a while. we craft the new water 10 at a time at the cost of something like 700 mana. this adds up. crafting 5+ stacks could result in a potential loss of 8g+ .
---
time is money and when we sell our water for so little its a kindness, it is not a requirement. we can simply just not sell it and that forces people too spend MORE money.
---
Could someone explain this to a wow noob? I see he enchanted it with +8 agi which is not ideal im sure, but that's as far as I got
---
It is pretty easy to gather melee cleave group to get +spell power +healing items for your healer. Unfortunately they can't really reapply CC and melt in AoE scenarios and also deal badly with running away mobs. Finding a good hunter is the only solution.
---
Wholesome family moment :)
---
WoW.
---
The 50s get rough with only an hour or two stay strong brother.
---
yeah the 30% dmg reduction plus pet utility is hard to beat.
---
have fun waiting around for your .01% of people who find tanking fun then &lt;wave&gt;
---
Imagine thinking people would waste their time helping you for free (unless they are your friend)
---
Did they change something with layers recently? My server still has 2 layers, but when I tried to swap layers in felwood to avoid an overcrowded area, the moment I left the group it layered me back to the original one.
---
Yes, that makes sense. What I will have to consider is how to implement it. The difficulty is that the set logic (union, intersection, etc.) quickly becomes expensive, since all tags and all messages and all players have to be intersected amongs each other for each "vantage" or reference point. Anyway, I love this stuff, so I look forward to tackling it :)
---
Lol? That's an enchant, bro. That's not itemization. How are you out here talking like you're a veteran, but you don't know how to tell the difference between an enchant and a normal stat?
---
It all comes down to when you swing that little main hand and try to finish the last 1% of damage to the raid boss, crit? yeah! dodge? hell yeah!
---
Everyone is going to say that you are the legend, and that's worthy!
---
Sounds you like you have a stick real deep in your shitter
---
You think you do, but you don‚Äôt.
---
The offhand is also from emperor, not princess, she drops the gloves.
---
I‚Äôd recommend migraine, it feels pretty balanced and gurubashi always has at least 2 full raids. Horde dominate BRM mostly but else it‚Äôs even
---
Maybe if you are allowed to dot the target. Which you are not in raids
---
You do realise that when bgs drop those players will return
---

---
Even 15 years ago there were quite advanced WoW bots.
---
VE is not worth a debuff slot.
---
You haven't been around 3yr old boys much then. It's all super heroes and bad guys. "Beat em up" and "you dead" are things I hear all the time. Everything is fine in context with good parenting to explain boundaries.
---
I help heal for mages doing their quest for the top tier water and drink for free after.
---
Right because tanks are the ones reserving most of the stuff.
---
Nope.
---
In my experience its mostly rogues and mages.
---
btw many european server just dead already without crossrealm...
---
I just want a paid transfer to get off a pvp server
---
I know I will never get my wish
---
Honestly was surprised the dog stopped chasing me for the ungoro one but Solenar wasnt too bad with the Curse that makes you immune to fear.
---
No the same insult fits fine.
---
Cause I'm not trying to make you angry. And spew what I can think of
---
I'm calling you what you are.
---
I don‚Äôt understand why this is an unpopular opinion, if it indeed is. Wanting them to then sell is literally the definition of greed, whereas wanting them to equip is need. There‚Äôs no arguments against either. Same goes for epics.
---
I roll need on something I NEED
---
Had this happen in hinterlands once.  Flapping around was fun until I took it to a major city.  Want to say I couldn't log but it magically fixed itself once I got to a super high pop area.
---
Layering does not affect queue times
---
This has nothing to do with "Reward for my behaviour" I also need the item, why should I pass on it because someone I dont know needs it "more" than me? That doesnt make any sense.
---
Shhhhhhh
---
It's weird mindset I have
---
Big brain time
---
I'm level 46 at the moment
---
Sounds like even less reason to go there.
---
Honestly, I was pretty satisfied until I got to the level where my character became completely covered up. I was excited to get armor upgrades and look like a bad bitch. Now im realizing how every piece of armor I get is the same, but a different color and is completely different on my same race, but the male variant.
---
I can tell you, except for the stealth part warrior feels the same.
---
Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that but that's pretty much what Arcane Torrent is Know for
---
*it‚Äôs beautiful*
---
I‚Äòve nothing on hand to give, it‚Äòs something they answered back during vanilla times. If there is an old blue tracker that goes back to 2004 and 5 there‚Äòs a chance to find it. It obviously happened back then too. 
---
Btw. a lot of things work on fractionals like skill updates with green items. They might not give a skill point but they can and will give a fraction and those add up somewhen to give a ‚Äöreal‚Äò point increase.
---
Nobody that didn‚Äôt work on the server code at Blizzard ever saw it; pservers emulate stuff to the best of their knowledge. What they do has really no influence at all what the official one is doing. It‚Äòs all best effort guess work. 
---
I remember there was an entire different discussion back then about loot tables and people remarking that c rand is not random uniform. I don‚Äôt remember the details from that though nor if Blizzard ever answered to that.
---
Thanks for the advice. I'll check out the videos. I figured if I start learning enough and practicing I'll panic less and get more methodical about my counterattack.
---
# [H] (Atiesh) &lt;Tilted&gt; is Recruiting!
---
Hi! We are &lt;Tilted&gt; on the NA server Atiesh and we are looking for new recruits!
---
We  are a friendly guild looking for new people. Above all we want to  foster a friendly social environment. We have a very supportive  community and  are happy to accept anyone.
---
As  a guild we are trying to promote a MidCore raiding environment. To us  MidCore means maximum effort with a minimum amount of time. When we  are    there to raid, we are there to raid. Our leadership has been in     everything from hardcore top 25 guilds to one night a week 10man normal  casual fun raiding. We all have jobs, university, family, etc. so we    are  by no means trying to be a server first hardcore style guild. We  are specifically looking for Hunters and Mages to fill raid spots but,  as stated before, we will accept anybody. We are a here to kill bosses  without sacrificing the bonds of community.
---
**Raid times:** Sunday and Monday, 5-8pm Server time(PST)

If you are interested in joining message me on reddit, join our discord, or whisper one of our officers in-game. At least one of us is usually online.
---
That's bullshit and your groupmate doesn't understand loot rules. If it's and upgrade you need. Otherwise you greed.
---
Cant wait for TBC servers
---
Only Hardiness is busted. Wotf isn‚Äôt that big of a deal.
---
So I should give up on an item thats better than what I have because someone I've never met before also wants it and its slightly better for him? Fuck off dude.
---
Watched like 4 minutes, all of it was other people taking agro and ruining the tame, not sure how that qualifies as a huntard.
---
I would somehow understand that guy if you were talking about some BIS item thats boe and is worth like 500 gold on the ah, but not for low lvl gear i mean come on...you will get barely more than the vendor price for them on the ah, if anyone even buys them...
---
If said BIS item drops i think its fair to give the guy who needs it the item, but he has to buy-out everyone else for a reasonable price, and of course he only has to pay 4/5ths of it. Just my two cents.
---
You really don't need it to be successful, what you say is just being egoistic.
---
There are two big reasons. The first is that one of the main reasons to even roll need on everything is so that you're not subject to ninjas. Asking people to distribute the money after the fact just brings this issue back up after it had already been dealt with. The second is that it takes a bunch of extra time. Everyone rolling need by itself doesn't consume any extra time. You're totally free to distribtute the gold yourself if you want to, it's what I have personally done with the two epics I've won, but it's certainly not an expectation. 
---
If you do it this way, everyone already got their fair roll, so it's not an obligation.
---
Druid healers ARE MT healer... Healing touch with a nice set off +heal is the most manaefficient tankheal you can got in a raid... They slam your hp to the burst with some intelligent downranking and are long runners. They are not worse than priests, sometimes even better on singletarget.
---
Hots are only used in movement fights when the healer has to run and then only to precharge the super talent from the restrotree which takes one tick of the hot and lashes instant the whole hp of that complete hot in 0 seconds.
---
I seens that druidic healers are underestimated and gimped by many players these days which is just sad...
---
This is why this helm is a must have for hunters.
---
it's either just staff, or dagger/sword/other one hand with an offhand
---
then always your trusty skul's ghastly touch
---
I only re-subscribed last month, work full time and am currently writing a PhD thesis in a foreign language, so re-living my 15-year-old glory days of Vanilla WoW is on the backburner at the moment. All things considered, this rate of progress is positively cracking.
---
Only reason I chose priest over lock. Sl/sl was so much fun in TBC.
---
Ah, yes. I remember annoyingly lagging into the Ironforge trenches all the time. Until I found out I just had to go into first person camera and stare at the ground to get my FPS back.
---
The majority of elitism I have encountered is from private server players and you can tell immediately when they‚Äôre super try hard p server players
---
Was there proof beforehand?
---
Gehennas has ~5k queue on weekend evenings
---
Shazz has about 1,5k queue every day

Stranglethorn Vale - the southern most zone of Eastern Kingdoms
---
I've run Maraudon 15 times and have never seen Blackstone ring or plate legs (which was quite nice upgrade for me), nor 2h hammer, nor 2h axe from rotgrip. It's just unlucky. 
---
I've got my ravager (\~12% drop) from SM armory in my 20-th run. But got 2h sword (\~12%) from Uldaman in my 3rd run. 
---
I was helping my friend to get a staff (14%) from witch doctor, we ran ZF 30 times, and 29 times no loot at all. He could at least drop gloves (33%). Finally got the staff on the 30-th run. 
---
It's not as their droprate is rigged or wowhead's droprate is wrong, it's just RNG not very good for generating true random numbers.
---
YOO, I joined netherwind. And I'm having a great experience, thanks

IPs will still be wildly different and enough to trigger Blizzards automatic flagging.

Some pretty tasty mp5 legs in there.

Yeah until they increase them is not worth shit.  I know they talked about upping them in a phase, but when are they going to 1.12 status?
---
You think you do, but you don't
---
It may be using the map for player location and maps don‚Äôt work inside
---
Hey nice! It really is a great server. The economy has started to settle and now it's in a pretty good spot. What faction are ya?
---
1. Jsut dont' delete the character
---
2. you can respec talents - just visit your trainer
---
3. re-visit them to see if you still don't like them
---
Should include the proof.
---
Ok... Meet me at the AH bridge.
---
For rogue, bis PVP is gnome
---
That's how early WoW was my dude, theres nothing to fix. Questing is just generally slow with more than one other person doing the same one. That's why dungeon cleave groups took off so hard, randoms won't suddenly show up and make content take 3x as long
---
If you have to advertise on reddit to get people to come to your server, you're going to have a bad time.
---
It literally doesn't affect anyone but the person making the group, if someone makes a BRD run and reserves HoJ, Golemlord trinket &amp; Arena epic chestpiece that doesn't affect else in any way whatsoever, it does however affect their ability to find people willing to join that group, they may only find low level caster dps looking for some free xp from a high level tank / healer, that's on the people making the group, everyone else that sees the message in chat saying "LFM ... ... -- Reserved" don't have any reason to be angry with what that group is doing, if they want to join they will, if they don't then they don't have to.
---
If it is a problem then make your own group with your own rules, I see a lot of group for Onyxia that reserve the head, I just don't join them, I join other groups that aren't reserving the head, it's not a problem for me that the ones reserving the head exist, and it doesn't cause me grief or anger to see them getting members and being successful, same goes for all the other dungeons with reservations.
---
I do find it funny when people try to reserve an item and can't find people for ages though, saw a UBRS run that reserved Jed's trinket and the main hand from Rend &amp; they must have been looking for healers and dps for nearly an hour.

^^^[WHY](/r/UselessConversionBot/comments/1knas0/hi_im_useless/)
---
How is that a "hotfix"? They change a core mechanic of being able to solo things in vanilla.
---
My GM has the screenshots from her GM convo. I was shocked to yo.
---
Humans dont get pvp racial til wrath.
---
It's kind of funny how I see it.
---
In vanilla everyone played Alliance because the Horde were ugly and were seen as the bad guys. Which is why Devs tried to attract players by giving the horde some really good racials.
---
TBC comes out and they give Horde Blood Elves to balance ratio even more but they didnt think that 80% of the wow population would flock to playing a Blood Elf.
---
So wrath til Legion they gave Alliance super OP pvp racials.
---
So pretty much dividing the population between Pve players going Horde and pvp players going Alliance. Which really sucked for horde players such as myself playing on a pvp server
---
Eq?
---
Was this planned and all these people showed up? Or is this what it looks like regularly?
---
This is definitely not an unpopular opinion.
---
I‚Äôm just hoping they will listen to my appeal and I can get this worked out
---
Yeah might make one then. I like how some helmets look (and especially halloween masks), but I also don't want to see that stupid goblin rocket helm.
---
Chill, Dwight.
---
Please get him a fiery enchanted Pickaxe or skinning knife so he can do damage w/o ever having to repair
---
Single target rogues will be second best after this tier.
---
Was this Faerlina when the server shit itself? Our instance was bugged when we relogged, forcing us to zone out or be teleported, along with every other raid in MC.
---
Undead always pays his debts
---
On my server, the robe recipe sells for 20 gold. So check the AH prices beforehand.
---
if you are planning on pvp, then scrap BS for engineering.
---
keep mining until you stop/get sick of DM
---
Join a high pop count server and you too can enjoy quests taking 1 hour to complete!
---
I always trap the doors in Scarlet monastery and walkways to boats on my hunter. Nothing quite as rewarding as seeing an alliance missing the boat in booty bay, inches away from it.
---
"Personal space"
---
"Social expectation"
---
It's a video game and the 3 year old is perfectly harmless if maybe a little annoying. Jesus christ, dude.
---
ST Drakestone farm just got significantly more difficult. :(
---
I just realised that I hearthed to stv while questing in stv, flew to under city,  zep. To org... i was so pumped to get 90 g and my mount finally, i forgot about thre boat... this was 2 hours ago and reading your comment reminded me.
---
Tank right thru

I'm Horde

You might get lucky, but I'd be getting a backup plan in place.

Same reason wearing a ski mask gets you in trouble when you enter a bank.
---
Those services are sold as safe ways to protect identity, but unfortunately the average person seems to see that stuff as dishonest and deceptive.
---
It's that flawed "you only hide if you have something to hide". Doesn't help that shady people use VPNs to mask traffic.

That's true parenting right there. Not letting him become a keyboard turning pleb.

Well where is it

Shieet

That‚Äôs why nobody measures stats on a 1:1 basis....
---
Wait i did not know this.  Such a long time noob
---
&gt;  Guess they figured that would be bad somehow. Dunno why.
---
Yeah, geez, why would that ever be considered a bad thing, disrupting someone's day like that, potentially on a PvE server where they didn't sign up for randomly being killed by another player?
---
Theramore is in kalimdor lol
---
I dont have it to send. I'm also to lazy to edit names.
---
Yours is not an unpopular opinion.
---
I always thought buying gold would ruin the experience, like getting your first mount or even epic mount. How hyped can you get if you just pay-to-win like that?
---
Do you think that you purchasing gold has taken away some of the gratification you'd otherwise get from completing it without using your wallet?
---
50 Days later. What did you end up doing?
---
Cloaking device
---
So leveling a warrior is impossible now lol
---
i need any pattern that i dont know yet for my profession.  why greed when it is something you can learn?
---
Fucking Arugal, man...
---
This sounds normal, on high pop realms no matter which layer I never see more than a handful of herbs, but I see like 20 lv 60s running around who probably gather herbs as well.
---
U gotta give names bro
---
Just tough it out until you get level 50+ weapons, it's just not worth spending gold on an item you're going to replace in a week for a buff that will equate to less than negligible grind/quest/dungeon efficiency. 
---
Save your gold for bis stuff when you're ready to start min maxing to compete with your peers
---
The easiest way is to stable it and just tame another pet with whatever skills you want death flayer to have, then teach it.
---
&gt; The horde identity is more savage and oppressive as compared to retail. 
---
It's less about being savage and oppressive, and more about an aversion to the Alliance side's tediously lawful good orientation. Being a goody two shoes gets old.
---
If you were a healer, that's all you need to see.
---
Alliance has the best pvp racials in retail by far. Human trinket, shadowmeld, etc.
---
Ehh it's the internet.  People can be rude and aggressive with nearly no repercussions so they go full rage mode.  That's the nature of the beast.  Best to just let them have at it and ignore them or you'll cross over and become one too.
---
I'm occasionally there already.  It's like walking hard, you never finish because you have to walk up everyday and do it! Walk hard. Heh.
---
Tank with a shield? What do you take me for, an amateur?
---
You can actually walk through the river and reach the grave without aggroing any mobs. I noticed this too late so I died a couple of times and then could walk out to the river without problems :-)
---
Tamed another, didnt work. This death flayer rare scorpion thats heavily camped bc top tier pvp pet:(
---
Life from 50-60 is going to be annoying to get voidie to keep aggro.  
---
Assuming you do the standard vw-&gt;SL-&gt;CoA-&gt;corr-&gt; immol you should be getting aggro when the mob is at ~60%.  
---
You don‚Äôt need a respec, just be prepared to eat/ drink a bit more than you‚Äôre used to.
---
MC and Ony are not easy af, they are not gear dependent, and more coordination and mechanic based. It really helps GM and RL to distinguish good players from plain stupid/I-do-DPS-do-not-care-about-threat players. Anyone can get their pre-BiS just by looking up which dungeons to grind. It doesn't make them any skillful or knowledgeable.
---
It's a pretty common spot to have Geddon tanked at the far end of the lava pool as you enter from the "hallway" into the room he patrols in. Ranged dps stay on the hallway-end right next to the lava and any Living Bombs can just strafe into the corner on the left of the hallway.
---
just switch it up.  _be_ the tank.
---
There is an alchemy consumable that causes damage to enemies in your proximity. Oil of immolation I think. Consider that too.
---
Arugal definitely still has layering.
---
So happy my server is finally unlayered. Makes it feel so much more natural.
---
Noone is denying that spriests bring utility and are worth running if you have 4+ warlocks. But you shouldn't pad their DPS by what their debuff achieves, just as you don't add the (enormous) raid DPS increase from CoE to warlock damage.
---
lol, you get used to it, its pants right now but stealth does get a little better at 40, to use it through 30's you almost need to use sprint as a requirement to get into range to attack them.
---
Feline Swiftness certainly helps too
---
Ok yep, that's fair. The whole paying a premium for high level professions I totally agree with.
---
Unfortunately, on my server anyway, my fishing is max and I can only sell the high end fish for like 10s or less sometimes. And that involved also spending a huge amount of time lvling, going out and manually catching the fish with a low drop rate, and also paying extra for the fishing lures to be able to catch them. So for me, if I can only get 10s for a fish, then I think 10s for a lockpick is fair.
---
Meanwhile I can out dps a frost mage in holy spec by just spamming smite. I just can't do it for very long before there's no more blue juice left in the tank.
---
And why are you ignoring the fact that the gold will be used in an equal upgrade for myself that will progress my character the same? It‚Äôs no difference in the end. But for some reason, because the extra step is involved of selling an item then buying one of equal value for yourself, you cant see that. Not once have people from your side of the argument given an actual explanation on why that‚Äôs wrong. For some reason they conveniently ignore that the item becomes an equal upgrade for all.
---
We have fishing, cooking and herbalism capped for our level and i have alt warrior sitting at 21. Not sure what lvl my gf's mage is.
---
this.  boe epics all need.
---
Their damage isn't trivial though. Just cause it's not within a ~1% margin doesn't mean their worthless.
---
We didn't know there would be a faction imbalance. :P We created characters and organized before it was apparrent what was going on and then by that point we are invested.
---
Thats really not an unpopular opinion at all
---
You must be fun at parties
---
still only seen a few examples of servers with queues again which could well be due to the fact that people who didn't like layering are coming back
---
How do you convince your guild that Ephemeral Power is a healer trinket, though? I failed at it so far.
---
Whatever Gaylord
---
I dunno, they have decent trash at lvl 30. Bristly whiskers and the like.
---
&gt;It‚Äôs only on Reddit we are a minority.
---
"Looks around at literally everyone agreeing with OP"
---
...yeah, OK buddy
---
If you run premades, yes. Shadow is a solo spec.
---
You say it's fair and then totally belittle my point.
---
In premades sure, but a lot of people will run solo and shadow really shines there.
---
YouTube might have some vids for dire maul east jump runs. Basically, you a healer and a dps (pref mage) kill 3 easy bosses for vendor loot/ ah stuff. Thorium veins are available too.
---
Bartender let's you add more bars and you can remove things like this and the bag bar
---
It does 100%. First seen in the duel tournament by Cdew. Reconfirmed by a shaman buddy.
---
Get out
---
Yeah it's a little sad :( Like I said, they can change the game but the people are the same. All they remember, all their habits, it's so ingrained. Classic is nice, but it's not Vanilla where everyone was NEW new.
---
Dominos lets you choose what buttons are shown
---
Bartender4
---
Saaaame boat. I was same level as my GM when I joined the guild, now my guild is already clearing MC and Ony, they've all blown past me. XD
---
Bartender. You can use default bartender and literally just turn those only off.
---
You're a frost mage- they can be slowed and rooted.
---
How did you die?
---
Playing on a severely underpopulated server this brings a tear to my eye. Our server was one of the first to be put on a single layer üò§
---
They are some of the most contested mobs in the game, so good luck with that
---
I'd like to know what kind of player can't mash one button.
---
Deadgame /s
---
I didn't say it was ninjaing. Just that it's obvious that equipping an item is prioritized over getting it for gold as per Blizzard's actions.
---
It's not think. It's literally how their design philosophy works. Did you know that in later expansions that needing on a BoE item makes it soulbound? The only reason why they don't do that now is because the "#nochanges" crowd would go apeshit.
---
Lol you are the opposite of fun
---
Didnt work! Very frustrating. I died while taming but still tamed, im assuming it bugged the pet.
---
Nobody said druids cant heal. Thats literally the only druid specc people universally agreed is viable.
---
First i thought it would be rude not to message back, but since i have 2 same level mages and got the messages on both, now as default i cba to answer anything.
---
No, I agree. I was just saying on my server perhaps the pricing of everything is skewed. Winter Squid are about the only one that goes for more currently, as high as 40s I've seen. Stonescale Eel was only 9s the other day.
---
They'll still lose 3-4 months of sub money from a shit load of players.
---
Also, my gf is the one with more time in her hands... So shes been leveling my herbalism and fishing.
---
You dont "need" any gear by that logic.  By the same "logic" Taking a BOP is only saving you money in that you're not buying a BOE piece for the same slot.
---
I literally just sat in Mojache at night time with all the ingame sounds muted except fishing noises, put the game in windowed mode and watched youtube for 4 hours doing it. Definitely tedious, but got enough fish for way over 300 cooking, and a good few stacks of Nightfin so I've got a nice supply ready to go too. Coastal fishing for Squid is probably a lot more lucrative now, but I did it a week in.
---
Skins will pretty much always sell for barely above vendor value, sadly.

especially if it's tank+healer+warlock that can summon you. Those guys are very well prepared.

---
No it doesn't
---
Well if you are playing shadow priest it kinda does matter. Archivist cape of shadow wrath from strat living is like 0.8% drop so you are looking to do hundreds of runs. 
---
So yeah, I play one myself but it is healthy to acknowledge weaknesses of the spec instead of spreading misinformation to push a narrative. Spriests are quite bad at 5 mans so if your goal is to collect their pre-bis it is probably better to heal while doing that for better group efficiency.
---
Sit at neutral, guardless flight paths. 
---
Kill people right as they come. 
---
Could work, even for bots.
---
&gt;There is no equal utility for BoP-s, because the people that can wear the BoP get more value from it than people that can't.
---
Yet you cant make the leap to realise that the exact same thing works for BOE things ;)
---
&gt; it's just an extra person doing next to nothing who also needs healing. 
---
Why even heal him though? Top off after fights if he makes it and you feel gracious.
---
&gt;Based off private server
---
Ding dong everything you say after this is wrong
---
I do it only if some appropriate lvl caster also needs it. I healed group finishing SM Cath on lvl 37, Uldaman at lvl 38 with lvl 45 tank and on lvl 39 with lvl 40 tank. So some items were above my lvl to equip em and I only needed em when dps casters greeded or passed.
---
Lfm brd, all loot reserved. Pay 10g instance/party entrance fee. No I'm not entitled.

Um don‚Äôt they only have 3 days to take the cod?
---
So that's why I was getting so fucked farming felwood this morning.... How does this make the game any better ? Now I can't do shit
---
Generally worth, if you‚Äôre trying to level first aid or tailoring you might not want to complete.
---
Back in vanilla, Vanisher on Thunderhorn EU would tank Scholo. Good gear, many +dodge items and skill (ofc!). Good timesüí•
---
Is there an EU post yet?
---
I'm pretty sure I won't. Work gets busier and busier until the end of the year. I'm trying tho lol
---
They should
---
Report it, it is bannable as you have an probable prior agreement. Essentially he‚Äôs a scammer and they can take measures to get it back to you.
---
Only for the few who are not Orc or Human
---
More edgelords
---
This.  Just wait 3 days and laugh.
---
It‚Äôs not suppsed to be easy finding a group. Back in vanilla you would usually set off an entire evening for getting a group and completing endgame dungeons. How long do you look for a group before considering the server dead?
---
AFAIK it's 30.
---
Our server looked almost like that yesterday, with layers. 3-4 raid guilds were waiting for both ony and chief buff (both CD's ended like 2-3mins of eachother).
---
Blizzard really needs to get their shit together, server lag was VERY real all the time. When the buff went off, server was unresponsive for 5s+.
---
Is cod 3 days? Or 30? Either way that‚Äôs fucked up and I‚Äôm sure that could be warranted for a report under some sort of harassment. 
---
I‚Äôve heard of someone on our server doing that with tons of BOEs. Pretty shitty
---
Not really, because the comparison is not between any given slot gear. It‚Äôs simply a fact that a BoE can be bought at any given time for the current market price. The only way to get a BoP is from dungeons - there is no alternative for it, and unlike BoE‚Äôs, BoP‚Äôs absolutely do not have equal utility (even monetary value) for all party members.
---
Dunno, this happens over (BiS) BoE epics as well.  Suddenly because it‚Äôs 100-200g the rules change? And the instances I witnessed still reference that they did same while leveling for BoE blues.
---
It's not nessesary, or else it would be called a fee.
---
I mean, you might want to provide incentive if you want their services again.
---
Sure you can get shit crafted for free, but incentive is important. Especially if the craft was a rare drop pattern.
---
It's a question of, do you want them to craft the thing or not. A tip can act as an incentive, letting a crafter decide wether it's worth their time to help you.
---
Staff of Jordan Peterson, the one he will use to smack your head if you don't make up your bed in the morning.

If this is possible, you'll want to do this closer to the grave. There's a guard at the Southern part of the town standing by the river.

Cod items only stay in their mail for 3 days... And don't forget to report him :)
---
Same for disenchanting , first day of playing with a mmo mouse i mistaken binds and disenchanted my main hand instead of applying poison lol
---
I‚Äôm one of those guys planning on twinking, and already working on it.  I have a bis 19 priest already done, a 95% done 29 rogue, and am working on a 39 lock and 49 warrior twinks.  I have every boe I will need for all four of them already.  BOEs for the priest cost me less than 50g total because I bought them mostly in the first couple weeks after launch at ridiculously low prices.  Prices on my server Herod-NA are on the rise for twink items now.  I sold an assassins blade for 150g last week.
---
I think there is too much guesswork going into it, but if I got one of the very rare items (shadow fang is rare but not like super rare) like a pendulum of doom or spellshock leggings I would wait to P3 to sell.   Although personally I wouldn‚Äôt sell spellshock, I would use them myself.
---
Some people suck.

Un-hyggelig ironically sounds nice.

Filthy casuals. In a few months people will ask for the LFG feature we have in retail.

Belive it or not, even arms warriors are stating that they do tank better, because their high threat generation and AoE damage with axe procs. They only problem is that their tanking is on healers shoulders entirely and no mana is left to heal a warlock who managed to get agrro from  his AoE.
---
"need" does not apply to anything that doesn't bind
---
this is known and you should know it by now. it's a 15 year old game
---
That's because your point is pretty horrible and not really how i care to play the game. Why are you so offended by how i choose to play the game?
---
Farming gold isn't hard, i dont see the need to get butt hurt because someone might get something and you dont. Its all a RNG sometimes other people win and thats ok too.
---
well my guildmates all multiple 60s now (2 at least, most have 3) so i wouldnt say people arent twinking
---
I sent a ticket to Blizzard, hopefully some action gets taken because I also think that because of the prior agreement he's actually accountable.
---
Oh, that's awesome then. Thanks for letting me know!
---
I've done this quest and oh yeah, that rod is a nightmare to get. I cleared the dungeon *way* more than just 3 times, and had *way* more than just 150 kills. I actually got a blue ring to drop while I was there, and my 28 empty slots of inventory *all* filled up, mostly with skins. I was still killing them for ages when my inventory was just too full to carry anything else. When it finally dropped I wasn't even relieved, just numb. Damn that was boring.
---
At least my alt with LWing benefitted much from it.
---
What if they are half a level from being able to use it?
---
It's used for a paladin quest, and libram of focus enchant. It was around 6g before dm launched because you could only get the enchant in dm. At launch the price spiked because demand spiked. The initial wave is over, but every time someone upgrades their gear they'll need another enchant, so the price will remain pretty steady, with jumps when new content is released. 
---
Whether the value goes back up or not depends on zg. There is an even better enchant in zg that requires the libram of focus enchant. However, at one point before 1.12 that changed, and you no longer needed the libram to get the zg enchant. People aren't 100% sure, so there is some speculation going on, but most likely it will be the later version and the diamond prices probably won't go back to the 25g level again.
---
Arcane crystals?
---
Yeah, I'm surprised they turned it off on Yojamba already.
---
It‚Äôs on par with or slightly above feral druids, from the logs I‚Äôve seen. So either strongest or second strongest hybrid, in terms of damage.
---
The effect will be doubled if the game character are named grommash and Guldan.
---
Based on the comments it's 3 apparently, still disgusting and I've sent a ticket to Blizzard!
---
That's something that's got me really worried. We have classic spawn rates etc but 2-4 times the number of people on a server? It's going to be a disaster.
---
how do you GET fidgeting avatars?
---
The ad directly below this post for me was talking about "fall layering" for coat shopping. 
---
The lulz were real.
---
There are plenty of quests at that level, so the cost from it isn‚Äôt necessary, and most of the gear gets quickly replaced.  
---
However in one of the later phases (duno which) all classes get a quest that sends them to ST, so it might gain popularity down the road.

A negligible increase in DPS, I wouldn't count on it for any meaningful numbers.
---
Google sap macro (or if you dont have imp sap then you can do the same with cheap shot i guess). You spam it and it saps the closest enemy as long as they re detected. But there are sub talents that both improve your stealth quality and detection of enemy stealthed players, and also the engineering goggles and perception from r humans as well as a buff from locks for improving stealth detection.

Rank 11 mount too

Cowren.
---
Well technically as of yesterday there is someone who can craft it now. But to your point there was not one but two alliance players who had the Lionheart recipe that transferred off.
---
The real reason seems to be, not really, because  it kinda pokes a hole in your argument.
---
Like i said, you play the game your way and I'll play it mine? Just make sure you tell people thats how you play up front, so people like me know not to tank/heal for you.

No.

---
You can also use vendor price If your like me and can‚Äôt get auctioneer to work
---
Ads have grown sentient, they now know we're interested in layering...
---
Because people are stupid and don‚Äôt know how hunters work and apparently hunter is the only class where it‚Äôs not ok to make mistakes if you do you‚Äôre an incompetent moron but any other class it‚Äôs just ‚Äúaccidents‚Äù.
---
The guards weren't as strong as they are now. Also there are stealth guards, too
---
Why do you give a shit that he gives a shit?
---
I wonder if they're using a stricter definition of group than we would normally see with outdoor mobs. Stuff like gnolls would be damn annoying if you couldn't split them...
---
Between Sunder and Faerie Fire, it really isn‚Äôt necessary.
---
This may have been the case with Retail, but I'm skeptical. Just wait till we see what the moba-script community comes up with for BGs. Scripted Reflectors and interrupts are at least two things I can think of that will come along.
---
HOTS EU is utterly infested with scripters and maphackers. Blizzard are losing the battle there.
---
Sorry, look for Xperl/Zperl.....idk where I got the Q from smh lol
---
I mean it's probably a pug, tbf.
---
Go back to frostbolting lol
---
‚ÄúEveryone is gonna play for a week and then go back to retail.‚Äù
---
Did you notice how you never talked about specs?
---
I tell locks not to life tap under 50% and then i heal as needed.
---
yeah because all the useless idiots playing useless classes like rogues and whatever else should get whatever they want while tanks and healers do all the hard work
---
The No Fun Police have arrived.
---
We did it as two mages. Needed an invis pot, or swiftness potion + slow fall. We ended up finding a bit more efficient route, but we based our strategy off of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_4p1FMXrW4
---
I suppose other classes could do it too, as we discovered that you you can simply jump down to the lower section (Where you otherwise see them float across in that video) And use an invisibility potion to get past the mobs and towards the spiders. After that, we kited any aggro to the reset spot they show in the video. It wasn't exactly easy, but we had lots of time to practice in 22 kills... couldn't believe the drop RNG.
---
layering is back on i think
---
Should we tell him?
---
Raids ping ponging between capital cities in celebration. Now there's no Thrall on another layer to turn your quest in to.
---
As another 14+ years player, you did nothing wrong.
---
OW=overwatch
---
No , not at all . Been rested leveling some characters to see which I like better and lock on . As of now i have a 58 rogue , 56 hunter , 48 shaman and focusing now on the 42 warrior
---
No, that‚Äôs just a suggestion. It‚Äôs bis for Mend Pet!
---
Clearly enough to type a comment, check mate brother
---
Canabalize the corps of your enemy
---
&gt;QuestieComms is now live! You can now see others progress on the tooltip without the quest. The latest Questie version is required by everyone in the party for it to work, tell your friends to update! 
---
Holy shit. Godsent to multiboxers everywhere. Theres been addons that track that, but they have been bit flimsy. Now i can track the quests from my main chars tooltips !
---
Nobody is confused at this stage it's been explained countless times bud
---
Yeah they are.
---
Hic! As a shaman the lack of buttons on your UI is laughable.
---
Well it was hotfixed quite fast after it was found, I think. Not fast in "next day" thing as we get now but probably like "next weeks reset". So it technically falls to "No changes" since it was done back then
---
Well you are picking really biased fights there. Warriors clearly win but you could use something like Baron Geddon or sulfuron.
---
About 130 total people in it. Yeah. Lol
---
The vendor price does not reflect the actual value of the item. 
---
For example, do you think that Thunderfury is only worth approximately 4g to warriors? That if I offered them 20g to delete the item, then they‚Äôll be like ‚Äúwow what a profit!‚Äù and immediately delete that? Of course not, because even a soulbounded BoP does not have equal monetary worth for different classes. Whereas a priest will gladly jump at the chance to get the 20g bonus instead of vendoring thunderfury, because they have no use for the item.
---
But a BoE does not suffer from such limitations, as it isn‚Äôt restricted by being BoP - everyone has equal utility here, because it can be exchanged for another BoE of equal value.
---

---
Might do some ketamine, but then I forgetamine and then I regretamine
---
Wtf is wrong with you? Need a reserved item? Join a next grp, or even better, start one yourself. Or are you too socially awkward to chat with people in an MMO, so you feel personally attacked when you can't join that one group you need?
---
My guild tries to do this as well and it's fucking annoying. Tanks with three epics insist on going dw fury tank because the internet said it was good, and we healers can barely keep them alive on trash. They spend ages getting world buffs when there's like an 75% chance they'll have died by the third boss, and then they whine about missing their buffs for the rest of the raid.
---
Most of the servers are dead af right now, honestly.
---
Yeah, me and my group of friends transferred off because of the queue times. Like 7 of us transferred. Lots of alliance transplants went to earthfury.
---
He is actually asking blizzard to ban him. Please for the love of azeroth, submit a ticket and include all screenshots and help make this disgusting turds wish come true.
---
no face: Ganking a player at or below your level.
---
Yes face: Mind controlling them off the booty bay to ratchet boat into fatigue causing water.
---
Go go good team!
---
As a hybrid ele/ resto, it is just common sense for me and communication.
---
If I am healing, I roll on healing loot and OS I ask should anyone else need it then I greed. No one else needs, then I need - I dont have to ask but I will state OS need after seeing all have said they don't need. If I do only need an elemental item in an isntance, I will state early on that I am rolling on dps items and not healing.
---
If I am dps, the same, healer doesnt need something then I take it (if I do).
---
When leading a group, I state, BOE blues are standard Need/Greed cos at 60 the blues are not worth an enormous amount. Have a conversation on who needs its etc. I also state BOE purples, we all need. I make sure to state this before an item drops and when we start the group.
---
Communication is key and being entitled isnt.
---
Start your own group? Not that hard man
---
[My favourite part](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/767227751138896407/1E66C021AC1095DBFEB98705EBCD65D04E70D3EA/), how can you just head in like that an not expect to die instantly.
---
This works, but some people don't want to drop the profession just to pick up enchanting. Just do it if you already plan to go enchanting.
---
That *was* their response - to imply that you are clearly socially deficient, because you were responding angrily to an obvious joke as though it were a serious statement. A+ for proving the point though.
---
Y‚Äôall are over reacting. Remember: in a month there‚Äôs gonna be a massive drop off of players. Wait what month are we in? Lol
---
My priest friend and I will adopt alliance with MC and sheep and take them on adventures

See the comments, removing layering causes ques on servers that didnt have them previously. Theres a LOT of people here that claim that removing layering wont affect queue size (i think my server still has 4000 que in the evening), GL removing layering from that. 8k ques after ?
---
Oh, I sure did!
---
That's gonna suck
---
So 3 minutes tops?
---
World is a server global channel. Used to look for party or sell stuff. Since it has a lot of spam, when you get a party you leave the channel typying /leave world. He wasn't trying to log out:)
---
So you got no cool response.
---
The class quests get added in phase 5. Questie marks it as available incorrectly.
---
can be, but other times you might want to be in defensive without a shield, so it's more like a ton of macros. One for swapping between DW and 1h+shield, one for stance dancing and using an ability, a cast sequence for going defensive stance, putting on shield and activating shield block.
---
If you're interested in a more in-depth view on warrior tanking, I'd suggest starting out by joining the Fight Club discord and watching Skarm's videos on youtube about tanking, specially his video "The (un)importance of the tank wearing a shield"
---
Yikes...pve
---
have you ever heard of a warlock curse?
---
No cause next patch leveling is canceled. So made sure I'm 60 before that
---
It's how it should be. Looks glorious. Compared to how it has been past couple of weeks anyways.
---
30 is regular mail
---
I don't think that's how it works.
---
Should be in the ZG patch.
---
This is some straight fire I love it.
---
ppl will lvl their cooking instead of buying food.
---
it's - usually - better to sell the raw ingredients.
---
Then your raid leads are incompetent as fuck.
---
What a fucking hateful trash of a video.  
---
Get a life.
---
No, neither do you for the Zulian Tiger.
---
That's awesome!  Got some surprises in that list too, it *feels* much slower to pally dps then to sham dps for example.  Also max war dps is insane, and max hunter seems to hit a ceiling not out there for rogues and wars.  Well last one isn't really a surprise I think that one is a lack of options thing before greater variety and itemization in BWL+
---
Sounds like I shouldn't go there at all.
---
Shit I got killed by a bear in winterspring when I landed at the alliance flight point and went AFK, the bots are already doing it!
---
Tested SM yesterday:
---
Started with Cathedral, but it was a pain in the a\*\* because most mobs there can interrupt. So very problematic/impossible to get heals off as soon as you got 5+ mobs and bubble is on CD.
---
Did a few runs of GY which was fairly simple and fast (cleared everything in 12-15min) which got me around 16g/h. If silk cloth would be worth sh\*t on my Server and if i had keys to open all the chests it could have been 20g+/h easy. 
---
But like you said: there is no vendor around so i had to delete some stuff and 20g/h as best-case-scenario (without getting some BoEs) is, again like you said, not really worth it. (Didn't test Lib/WK tho).
---
Alts don't get exalts.
---
8 heal and dps enchant
---
Gotta applaud those Orc engineers and architects.
---
Oh that is that moron that is crying that streamers ruin servers and then mutlibox 40 chars himself ...yea idiot
---
I believe blizzard can set any droprate they want, and everyone will take it as given because "private servers had no clue on the REAL droprate"
---
Where have I said that people don't want to play? Just healers get groups easier than dps outside of DM. The whole message chain was about op trying to claim that shadow priests are great in 5 mans, which they are not. I am not calling them garbage but they aren't good either.
---
Clearing a dungeon quickly and smoothly is rewarding in itself. Do you laugh at tryhards in raids too, even though they‚Äôre also incredibly easy?
---
First words were 'unpopular opinion' - so ya. I prefer gold over a stranger getting an item he will replace in a day or two
---
Hey remember this post? Funny that servers without queues for weeks have queues tonight when they removed layers
---
I think they'll be "forced" to introduce this sooner or later. When smaller servers become less and less populated, they'll probably bring it out. If I were to guess, it'll probably be a while, but I think the demand is/will be there. Plus it's easy money for Blizzard, and it's a feature that was there in the later part of vanilla anyways.
---
The fact that you enchanted at all was the real misplay. Counts against buffcap.
---
Gehennas is great (I play horde). If you enjoy a populated server and massive battles, come join. 
---
There are queues though, so keep that in mind.
---
While leveling, blue drops are worth a decent amount of gold to players that already have 60s and have spare coin to throw at their alts. On your first character, it would be foolish to equip those as it only saves a little bit of time killing mobs and gold is worth much more to you. Understanding that, all blue BOEs are better off need rolled.
---
At level cap, it is debatable and every group will have their own rules for it. My opinion is that area specific BOEs should be need over greed, while world drops are up for grabs.
---
We should not. Bans in real life are a very bad thing, not worth it to get the cold weather items we need.
---
I tip rogues depending on whats in the box. The more its worth the more i tip
---
Lol right?
---
This guy is crazy.
---
Hope this guy recieves a permanent ban tbh.
---
They will return the axe but I refuse to believe people get banned for stuff like this until I see a proof. I see so many people throwing bannable offenses here and there but honest to god I haven't seen a single screenshot or anything proving someone got banned for holding cod or the like.
---
exactly that, so taunt alone makes a warrior an absolute necessity, otherwise getting aggro of your healer is a dice game
---
Yeah, agree. Our resto druid is my guilds top healer (we only have 1 rdruid atm, like you said it works best that way), though that may be because we have gotten so many druid items.
---
there is 0 difference in tankyness between Furyprot and Deepprot
---
literally 0
---
the question is just weither you can afford to take off your shield or not
---
"No changes"
---
I‚Äôm so sick of this fucking meme.
---
So you are saying ints a toxic server, and does APES have a big impact?
---
Dude I wish I had 30min.
---
I am on Lucifron - Germany
---
Weekdays prime time 2-3k queue (up to 2hrs)
---
Sunday evening: 4-5k (over 4hrs)
---
The queues at prime time are constant and it looks like still increasing over time... 30min would be easy compared.
---
Generally speaking, pets tend to be a liability in high level dungeons and raids, so instead of just having a passive imp you get to sac your succubus for a hefty damage increase (don't underestimate 15%!). I don't play warlock but I suppose the talent indeed isn't very useful while leveling.
---
Oh no...I'm on that server
---
So this is a freaking good plan to earn money. Get money from enchanting the wing thing and let your buddy earn 100g for the disenchant
---
Sac vw for shield and then resummon basically instantly is pretty nice for survival.
---
Sorry to disappoint you, but i have too much of an actual life to join them.
---
Can't wait for some creep to draw this
---
When I have extra mana (say 50% or more) I throw them a downranked heal now and then after they tap, but I expect them to fend for themselves. 
---
If a warlock goes in and starts Hellfire spamming and pulls aggro (especially if he's tapped to low HP and doesn't bandage/drain/HS up) it's all on him. I don't care how good you say the damage is compared to RoF, if I have to spend more mana keeping you alive than tank on this one you should either have drained for a while and allowing tank to establish aggro before going in to Hellfire, or just gone with RoF. Stupid move to begin with.
---
ah ok ty. I'm desperate to get any dagger to try pvp dag spec by phase 2 :(
---
How much does it make you lag?
---
Irrespective whether it is 3 or 30 days, this is abusive and you should immediately raise a ticket against the player. Also edit your post and tell people what realm you are on so people can choose to ignore him.
---
*/laughs in Deviate Delight*
---
Done 20+ pug runs, lost roll 5 times.
---
Running with guildies, ring never drops.
---
AMA
---
Raids and dungeons. Demonic spec and destroy ruin build. You throw your dots, curse of shadows and spam shadow bolt.
---
You can replace enchants, but +8 agility is expensive, like 100g according to someone below.
---
^(For those of you as confused as me why this thread is a thing)
---
Or Pitbull
---
even if you can't open it yourself?
---
They've fixed this now, was a blue post about it a few days back
---
lol what a boomer response
---
That's why ypi only loot the leather and let something stay in the corpse and rot so no one can skin
---
Achso soweit habe ich nicht gedacht, da ich ja nichtmal zum Quest annehmen komme ohne zu sterben.
---
Get questie
---
Gehennas hands down. You have APES on alliance along with some others like Salad Bakers &amp; Bizzno. We on horde have a bit more population, but those guilds know how to bring the numbers to wpvp. (Last night they rode in as ~160 people to brm for MC, good fights.)
---
Had numerous 100+ vs 100+ fights so far.
---
I don't know about a permanent ban but I'd definitely like scammers like this to receive a 3 to 7 days suspension.
---
They have not. Please do not spread misinformation.
---
&gt; Most enchants now do not count towards buffcap. Arcanums still do, as do other enchants that are applied by an item instead of a player, such as AD shoulder enchant. Currently testing stances/scopes to see if they still apply.
---
I think you missed the part where he was already proven guilty?
---
Each layer can be run on different computer nodes. Aka, with two layers you could possibly have 2x the computing power, memory bandwith, IO to storage access etc.
---
This is such a wrong mindset... After I lost hoj roll for the forth time I started making groups where I was reserving it but always included bosses for the casters so everyone gets something. I literally helped more than 10 people to get the trinket from golem lord and countless more, maybe about 30 casters to get the belt from arena until I got hoj and savage gladiator chain.
---
Find a warrior or 3 that also want to do it. You be the healer in the group.
---
Keep us updated
---
Whats hardiness?
---
You seem to have a good grasp on most things. What class and role do you play, I wonder?
---
I don't want to turn it into a witch hunt. I did however send a ticket to Blizzard.
---
Geez. How long until phase 5?
---
What's this about a hotfix to mob aggro that resulted in making solo Tribute runs more difficult?
---
&gt;I think the largest factor is that Horde has much stronger PvP racials that make solo play quite a bit more fun. 
---
Back in Vanilla, this was a balancing factor. Bloodlust was too, it was better for PvE progression. So the power players mostly went to Horde. Alliance was more attractive aesthetically, Horde lacked anything cute for female players pick or teenage boys to play doll with. 
---
When BC came out, Blizzard gave Horde Blood Elves to fill that niche for them and it broke the balance and never recovered.
---
Obviously I didn't read it, I am sorry I didn't pay you a licensing fee...
---
I'd keep their names in mind to make sure I don't group with them when they're leading a party.
---
Care to offer a rebuttal?
---
Yojamba is really solid if you do consider changing!
---
No, please no. Need is "I want to use it, it will make my character better". Greed literally means "I am greedy, Iwant to sell it for gold".
---
&gt; due to the fact that people who didn't like layering are coming back
---
Nobody KNEW the layering was going to get removed (on certain server) before it happened. The information was given AFTER the fact. When people already noticed the new ques, figuring that hey, maybe they took out layering.
---
not when i did it, there was a patrol within agro range of the grave
---
Fair enough. Personally, I do not consider Googling a skill per se, but to each their own. But I would agree in that people now are generally less ignorant about game mechanics and character optimization than they were back in the days of vanilla.
---
While people do probably spend more time researching than they did back then, I would still say that the bigger factor is the fact that all the changes to itemization, talents, dungeons etc. leading to 1.12 has made the game much easier than what it was in it's earlier incarnations.
---
That‚Äôs not a tip that‚Äôs just payment lmao
---
Fury warr DPS with their bis (including leather) &gt; rogue dps in their bis gear.
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/rankings/1000#metric=dps&amp;class=DPS
---
There's your argument. All fights except one fury warrs are winning, and that one is one of the smaller margins in all the boss fights.
---
Now, I'm not the person you were talking to, I don't think it's even remotely important in this easy easy expansion to min max and make sure everyone is doing everything PERFECTLY. But, what these people are saying, that you seem not to be hearing or perhaps just disagree with, is my above argument.
---
I agree with your playstyle. I think your type of guild, in this type of content, would probably be the most rewarding say to play for myslef. Getting epics feels dope. Even if they're not bis.
---
From what i remember reading a little while back its on par if not SLIGHTLY better than the usual "pre raid bis" you see people advise on, the issue with this set is the transition from preraid bis to raid bis is abysmal because you cant break your set effects otherwise the gear is trash compairitively.
---
yah thats somewhat legit then i suppose
---
And somehow this sub loves that layering is removed.
---
What is it with this sub that they wanna torture themselves because " that's how it used to be"
---
Why does this sub love waiting for mobs to spawn
---
Love the myth that had been spread by PS tanks about duel wield tanking. It is shit, anyone who actually played vanilla who was a healer knew it was shit. You run it you need to get rid of 2 DPS'ers and have 2 extra tank healers. Which is not even needed as threat is not even an issue. It is clear this raid group is toxic. I suggest the healers leave and find another guild.
---
Does not seem unreasonable if it was a short fight.
---
Nah, it's cool; it was upvoted again.  People do get funny.
---
Well, funny people do.
---
The 250 lockes boxes from bay of storns from fishing rarely have more than 10s in them.
---
Like 1940 bro
---
penfold!
---
&gt;Rain of Fire isn't "not quite on par", it's about half the damage of Hellfire and costs nearly twice the mana per second. It pulls loose mobs just as easily as Hellfire too.
---
Read those two lines again and tell me how it "just as easily pulls loose mobs" ? If it does half the damage...
---
The key to fast runs isnt everyone doing max dps with max risk. Its controlled pulls with nobody dying. One guys aoe dps isnt going to compensate the extra 1min+ it takes to res, buff, redrink for a healer.
---
Gonna make so much bank when Arugals second layer is gone sitting on the mailbox opening lock boxes.
---
Allocate key debufs, leave two slots open for when some idiots inevitably proc deep wounds or poison (multiple low prio debuffs batched together can knock off a higher prio one), and any leftovers go to SmRuin warlocks to use corruption.
---
I know it's a joke but please don't disenchant epics nobody needs. You get 2 blue shards, which is less than its vendor value. Keep them till phase 3 when they start yielding nexus crystals.
---
Love hurts....
---
armor is a good point but get one of those black capes from ony, UBRS, or something, a black shirt maybe, a darker tabard. that might work
---
On my server people seem to mostly respect pre-bis lists.
---
Haha I posted this a week or two ago! Glad I‚Äôm not the only one. Too bad they announced the end of layering earlier today
---
Blaze it for the earthmother
---
Nice b8
---
report them
---
I don't even play warlock and this pisses me off, it was a huge part of the game to me
---
Tauren are the nicest race in the game.
---
On my mage, I like to play, do I crit or not?  If I crit and 1 shot this horde with fireblast, he dies. If he survives the fireblast, he can continue to live.
---
Seems like you don't realise that there are 16 debuff slots in Classic.  There's enough room for 3-4 warlocks to put Corruption on the boss.  They won't be using other DoTs, though.
---
Stacked portals to the wrong city.
---
Totally agree with you OP.  So far everyone I‚Äôve grouped with (mainly ppl from my guild) have the same mentality.
---
Just played on Netherwing for 3 months world PvP is dead as soon as you can 60% in the air
---
Bloodlust was added to the game in TBC. It was not a vanilla ability. Alliance was also far easier to raid with due to paladins and their blessings + fear ward. Human mace + sword spec are also incredible for both dps and tanking. Axe spec for orcs is good too but the best weapons are swords so the human weapon specs are better.
---
To be fair, I quit after reaching level 40 a few weeks back. 
---
Not because it's bad, but because of how time consuming and addictive it is.
---
I've been 60 for weeks, have ran hundreds of dungeons and grouped with dozens of people to quest. Ive never had a ninja once. The problem is vastly overstated. If you say "need on all BoEs" and everyone else says no... then leave the party.
---
Ofc less people will be playing then release. Same reason why movies best week is opening week.
---
Finally a true vanilla experience
---
Old fart, lol.You're still 27 playing mporgs, complaining that it's not easy enough for a hunter,  hardly in any position to judge. Amusing you change insult from being younger to being older. Kido
---
Short answer: Raids and dungeons. When solo, sacrificing your pet is generally not a good idea.
---
What is your unit frames addon?
---
This sounds about right. If I've stockpiled up a heap of lockboxes I do tip, but not for a single puny box. Professions, it depends - early on or for low level recipes a few silvers to a few 10s of silvers, and for normal mid-higher level stuff up to 1-2 g. Rare / in-demand recipes (Devilsaur, Hide of the Wild) can go for 10-50\~g depending on competition, realm, realm economy and population.
---
Can confirm, had a 2k queue last friday.
---
Takes a decent chunk of crit to make it worthwhile. Probably best bet is to be siphon life.
---
Spirit trumps healing power on longer fights, especially with 3T2. And for shorter fights mana is better anyway (unless they're so short that you physically can't run out of mana, which is the case in MC but that's not really something a healer should optimize for).
---
No, tanks move out of inferno. There is no need to take the extra damage.
---
Where in there did i say its a physical server ? And actually, it absolutely CAN be a different physical server. But most likely its just another virtual server.
---
The thing is, you cannot just slap more cores to make a unlimited number of players in one layer. When you have few raids waiting for a buff in a city, the server LAGS LIKE MOTHERFUCKER even with layers.
---
"So many months later" Its been two months and now the servers are leveling out. It's great,  I love this game. However the real test of how WoW classic is doing will be in 4 months time, not now. However you can keep sitting there and upvoting the "LOOK HOW FULL THIS SERVER IS " posts and circlejerking if you wish.
---
looks like Desolace
---
Reminds me.of reta.wow somehow
---
jokes on you they are really a mage
---
As a paladin, I can confirm
---
In our 5 man the druid got it for offset cause I had mageblade as the warlock and the priest had benediction xd
---
rEpOrT tHeM
---
Whats good about it for pvp?
---
It has 1.6 attack speed and is a fucking scorpion. The poison does very low damage and would only be useful against rogues. 
---
Another rare pet i prefer for pvp is spiteflayer. It has 1.2 attackspeed, not as squishy as a cat but still gives decent pushback.
---
Sure bingoboy
---
How can you guys listen to more than 5 seconds of this video with all the screeching going on?
---
- Shitty Chuck Norris name, check
---
- Absence of proper keybinds, check
---
- 1000th post about the game being alive after less than 2 months, check
---
Yeah that's your average classicwow poster allright
---
Definitely swear I have seen people botting while mining thorium
---
deport them
---
The rod itself isn‚Äôt that bad - mindless grinding 100+ mobs is good exp after all. It was the wpvp in and around the cave that really made it a nightmare. 
---
As for the graveyard, I was lucky enough to run in and out without dying, as a hunter. My pet was not as fortunate.
---
My vanilla server was need on ALL BoEs, so there is no bullshit.  And if a person wanted them, they would trade(doesn't happen everytime, especially on items worth many golds)
---
I haven't played retail in like 2 years, so yeah - were; to me.  Can't use present tense if I don't presently log into retail
---
It‚Äôs not about taking it for money. Money is just a reflection of value. 
---
The reason people defend needing BoE‚Äôs is that its value can be realized even if the person cannot use it himself. Consequently, people don‚Äôt defend it for BoP‚Äôs, because that value cannot be equally realized.

Your counter-argument hinged on the suggestion that BoP‚Äôs can also be realized for equal value - the vendor price - but the fallacy in your assumption is that the vendor price accurately reflects the value of the item. Yet you clearly see the absurdity of this statement. Take the warglaives of azzinoth, which vendor for 20g. No rogue will part ways with this item, just because someone offers them 50g to delete them. That‚Äôs because its obvious that 50 g, while more than twice the amount you can vendor it for, still doesn‚Äôt even come close to capturing its true value. That 50g will buy him nothing comparable from the AH.
---
If a priest rolled and won the warglaives, the he‚Äôd happily jump at the chance to profit from the 50g. The alternative is to sel it for 20g or disenchant it - all paltry pennies. That‚Äôs the valuation difference.
---
If the warglaives were BoE, then the value doesn‚Äôt depreciate like that. Both the priest and the rogue could exchange it for the market price and buy items that equalled that value.
---
It‚Äôs so unoriginal that someone else on the server already had Rogue and Roguee and probably Roguee with one accented ‚Äòe‚Äô so this is what they had to settle on.
---
Nihilum is on the horde side, guess there are big guilds on both sides
---
You can VE until the phase when Nightfall gets released as that's one mandatory debuff that's unavailable at the moment.
---
It's done already

One that should be banned.

Fr the bank and AH roof can hold a whole raid up without even budging

If they lifetap to 10% and don't eat, I just trade them a single linen bandage.
---
Yes I'm level 60.
---
Bosses die so quickly now that shadow priests are alright tbh. Depends on the encounter, but often there's not enough time for their mana inefficiency to be a huge problem. Hell, I just did Rag a few hours ago and we one-phased him with a shadow priest at the top of the meters. He was #7 for the instance total. Would've been even better if we had a nightfall.
---
how much do ppl tip for enchants?
---
I'm going to have to be a bit two-faced here.
---
The happy part:  
---
This is good stuff and the way it should be. Kudos.
---
The snarky part:  
---
He got 4 pieces of vendor-worthy crap, you got an awesome tanking sword. That's a pretty damn good trade for you :)
---
Thats what he said
---
I think it's the name of the orc racial giving 25% stun resist.
---
Back in 1.12, realms were split into Battlegroups.  My Battlegroup had 16 realms and mine was the only RP server.  With Classic having so few servers, I doubt they'll do Battlegroups at all and just throw everyone in a region together.
---
Hope your hearth was on the other continent ^(and that he can't swim)
---
Nah you just gave a very kiddo wibe. Repeating stuff people say without much afterthought. Then when you disclosed being a old fart i asumed everything must feel slow to you.
---
Its not hard to level a warrior 1-60. The leveling part is very easy for all classes.
---
&gt; I mean you will have much better matchups vs a mage but generally the hybrid specs do better in PvP for druid.
---
Correct, NS + HOTW is much stronger. Instant cast heal is critical to many matchups.
---
Bop's have the same value to every player, they vendor for the same price to everyone and if they lose the roll they can always run the dungeon again and try again ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
If something is an upgrade its an upgrade it doesn't matter if its bop or boe. Not everyone has the gold to buy upgrades off the AH and its just selfish of people to take an obvious upgrade for someone just so they can make a bit of gold for themselves, which is why it's called greed!
---
This should put to rest the question of "Are PvE servers full of fun players or are they just bland as hell?"
---
I bought 50 gold on my first character in 2005. I needed to get a mount at 40.
---
I was playing a warlock.  Mother fucker nobody told me
---
Ok the go for it, i really enjoy tanking and i ve gotten a lot of praise for being full prot, i didnt know there were so many arms warriors tanking with 2h weapons
---
Holy shit. Can you farm even anything on that server without at least 20 people competing? I play on a supposedly low pop server (EU Heartstriker) and most farming spots (WS Furbolgs, Satyrs etc) and routes (Thorium in Ungoro, WS, Plaguelands) are full all the time already. I cant even imagine how it is on a server that literally has more than 10 times the population.
---
Witch hunting is against the Reddit ToS as well as this subreddits rules.
---
That's a mortgage.
---
Venoxis, Germany is a Pvp Server, quite full ( you may have a queue of 20 - 30 mins at common login hours). Can not tell you the ratio, but seems balanced in my view.
---
Check out Bloodfang - It seems pretty even, but then again, I'm Horde side so maybe that's just bias with a Horde edge. And as you point out, no real numbers to go about.
---
A few MC / ony guilds on Horde at least plus some pugs popping up every week it seems. Mostly medium / medium-low depending on what time and day, never had to que.
---
Why is Deathflayer thought of so highly?
---
So many fantastic debuffs out there, but after playing BC and Wraith I had forgotten all the classes that were totally ignored because of straight up dumb choices on blizzard's end.  No dots for locks or priests, no rip for feral, etc 
---
I can get behind many of the no changes things but I'm not totally sold on this one, but if we give a little on that we're going to end up with BFA classic so.. fine. Damnit.
---
I boosted a friend through wailing caverns on my 58 mage. Not a single enemy missed when attacking me. Grouping up 20-30 mobs 40 levels below me and they had near 100% hit chance does not make sense. I hope this is a bug.
---
I emailed them but they are kinda stupid.
---
Though I had to move my files over to another hard drive and now it isn‚Äôt doing it. Maybe that‚Äôs a solution ?
---
I will kill any horde fishing. If they are fishing thats practically handing me a free kill as most of the time they are half afk
---
Checking in at 43. Im hoping for a NYE 60
---
Why do you call it "toxic" when PvP is expected and encouraged on a PvP server? It's not toxic in any way. Even if they were flightpathcamping it's not "toxic". Not everything unpleasant that happens to youin life should be labeled "toxic".
---
idk maybe your server in particular is bad for this. On mine there's very few groups that reject based on class. Usually the only issues is lack of tanks
---
You think you do but you don't
---
I will take a look, thanks man!
---

Hahahah this fucking dbag thought he would race to first MC/Ony kills.

I couldn't even imagine being that deluded. Only a complete narcissist could believe such a thing, imo.

---
Also check out Warcraft tavern leveling guide.
---
A bop is worth more than the vendor price to the player who can equip it, otherwise they would be ready to part with the drop if you paid them the vendor price and just lol try to bribe someone to not roll on rend mh they need and tell me how it went. A boe is worth equal gold to every single member of the party, every party member can sell it on the market for f.ex. 200g, and the player who can use it saves that 200g by getting the item without having to spend that gold. If you can't grasp this difference between bops and boes it's no wonder you're advocating for moronic loot rules on reddit.
---
Ouch.  That's unreasonably cold from people you're helping.  I'm sure karma has your back eventually man.

Helm of Narv (epic mail helm) dropped a couple of nights ago in Scholo. Was an obvious upgrade for the hunter in the group. He was hesitant to roll need because it‚Äôs worth a lot of money (100g or so on my server, which to be honest isn‚Äôt that much I think). I told him he should *absolutely* take the damn helm, and the rest of the group agreed.
---
Epic or not, if it‚Äôs an upgrade and you equip it immidiately it‚Äôs the damn defenition of a need roll.
---
Ye our druid on our first MC got 3-4 pieces T1, T2 pants and wild growth spaulders. (We went Need Before Greed-system so only druids on the leather healing gear).
---
every hinter in uldaman
---
Yeah I know.  I do it every week.
---
Rushing later phases will make people skip earlier content. It is human nature. Why clear MC when you can skip MC entirely and get better gear? The community in general will skip content. And the time line on the game will compress as people will clear naxx quicker and get bored with the game quicker.
---
So you got no response. Cool.
---
Not sure if me being a warlock helped me in this case.
---
Wrong, its super nice to sac Voidy when farming for almost no downtime.
---
He litearlly said it in a stream ?
---
Teams were made up of players from multiple servers.  I played RP-PvE, so I was often the only player from my realm on the team.
---
I think this massively depends on the item. If a 500g BoE epic dropped in Strat that I couldn't use, i'm rolling need on it every time and I think most people are too.
---
Its not toxic. Its just that most people on this sub is fucking loosers IRL. And the only thing they have going for them is their character. 
---
Beta males behave like this. Super passive aggressive and always smug online. IRL they barely look you in the eyes when having a conversation.
---
Yes of course, better give the shadowfang to someone who equips it for a little dps increase instead of selling it for 200g+. 
---
This is a drastic example but essentially BoEs are a currency too, if someone wants to equip it badly, they could jsut buy it from the AH.
---
On what server does icemail jerkin go for 50g?
---
You can always check this webpage (official realm status) if your realm is layered or what the population status is. If it says "New", then it has layers.
---
[https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/status/classic-us](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/game/status/classic-us)
---
This so much.
---
All the locks and paladins in our guild didn't bother saving up for 60 "because I get a free mount in P2" and now they all want every crystal I mine for 5g :p.
---
Was this on the Yojomba server? I recall seeing someone doing this today and said some rather vile things haha
---
I myself play a rogue and have Full pre raid bus +MC weps, there are no groups at 60 looking for only mages, unless you're trying to join lowered level BRD groups. And if it's really that big of a deal have you thought of maybe starting your own groups? I MeanI understand maybe being afraid of starting a raid but, making your own Strat Live and BRD groups really isn't that hard.
---
Sorry to sound if I'm bashing but really it's a dumb reason to quit.
---
[I'm just going to leave this here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Wrw3c2NjeE)
---
Make your own groups.
---
Hey man, great work ! 
---
But which channel does it scan for info? Any personnalised channel or just the /lookingofrgroup ?
---
It's not and shouldn't go to a priest until every mage/warlock has it
---
Gear‚Äôs first and last purpose is to be used. If it‚Äôs a good upgrade for you, feel free to need on it, regardless if it‚Äôs green, blue or epic. It‚Äôs that simple.
---
deepprot tree has no good mitigation talents
---
Oh wtf. My wife and I were talking about this.
---
Wondering with classic if people are unleashing hell down onto the innocent golddhire folks like back in the days
---
Ret paly here.
---
Not having any issues.
---
I haven't heard that people would run aoe groups on lvl 60 anymore, at least not on my server.
---
But I have bad news for you: It was same like this already 15 years ago for Rogues. Your class is a popular dps class and finding groups can be really hard. Just keep playing well and be active with finding/forming groups and you have a chance though.
---
HAHAHA yes! I was targetting you for it, you ran past 3 times and i dropped the line every time, to bait you into a reaction. I was laughing my head off, this innocent human thinking we were in a love story and all that was coming out at my end was profanity
---
It got &lt;1% droprate on most databases. I wouldnt  rely on it dropping any time soon
---
haha I√§ve always tipped 25s, only once have i actually received something worth more than that. Think i need to tone it down.....
---
Don't forget about the CoR on the mob they're fighting, and a cheeky fear if they get close to killing the mob. Gonna have to work for that quest mob boy!
---
Update us with a response
---
And to be honest, it's kind of true of warlocks as well.  They're far down on the bottom half of dps, but ss and summon and do other raid utility.
---
You get lots of points from lockpicking the junkboxes. Are you misunderstanding me on purpose?
---
It worked like this in vanilla, they are in insane if they follow through with this.
---
Of course it gets stale quickly if you play 10 hours a day 7 days a week. All games do
---
I heard pala and warlock is a godlike combo. The pala goes aoe tanking + heals and the warlock has tools to keep the mobs from fleeing and buffs with a neat reflection aura (imp fireshield?). Both get a free mount at 40 and both have low mobility. Little itemupgrade overlaps as well.
---
Conflag is good burst spec for PVP, but kind of gear dependant. It needs crit, which is not a common stat on pre-raid bis blues. It's definitely viable, but wont be as good as later on with gear. For early P2 SL will be the safe bet, it needs only spell power and stamina and its tanky af.
---
Look at the bottom of the prot tree- there‚Äôs great quality of life stuff, but pretty much none of it contributes to damage mitigation.
---
That‚Äôs what the other poster is getting at.
---
Cry
---
On private servers, you got a full tribute (3 items) just for skipping Captain Kromcrush. That's not the case in Classic, you have to do the ogre tannin miniquest to get the full chest; but people still just skip him instead, thinking it'll do the trick, because nobody wants to bring the mats for the thingy. Just explain to your group that if they aren't doing the tannin, there's no reason not to kill him.
---
It scans any public channel you have joined, like world, LookingForGroup, LFG (yes, those are different), General, Trade, etc.
---
Hahaha I love it !
---
This says it all, your impatience is getting the best you (OP) just make your own groups and find a guild that's on the down low for raiding if that's what you're looking for.
---
70% horde btw
---
Yeah, in a pve server maybe
---
Warriors never lose to rogues
---
"Many people are saying it! Believe me!"
---
Then you have pretty bad SP in your raids. In early Vanilla they deal more than any casters. Just watch logs. Look for Eqgle for example, Guild mate.
---
lmao no fire res while tanking ragnaros, what the hell. Like i knew tips was bad and lying about having played in vanilla, but didn't know he was THIS clueless, because he did play on private servers afaik so he should know this shit. Wtf, gobsmacked. I know a dude in his guild from private servers, no idea why he's still in it if raids are like this.
---
Its hard to keep up with all the horde scum that should be on my imaginary KOS list.
---
Most guilds don't use DKP.
---
Maybe, but our guild prioritizes healing priests for staff, before someone who's going to still be significantly behind the top tier dps even with the staff.
---
There's practically no defensive advantage in going deep prot. Lack of conc blow, 10% damage and shield slam don't make healing harder. Not wearing a shield on pull however...
---
im on a unbalanced server , it will be even worse with transfers but i still think they should be an option 
---
making players play on a server they dont like is not a good thing
---
Running around in circles, or how-so?
---
I enjoyed the video ty op
---
Wrath had a re-release as an entire raid tier, argent tournament, and a gated year-long raid. Hardly the best content.
---
Not to mention lfg, frost emblems, heirlooms, or the general class/spec homogenization.
---
Wrath had some high points but it was a deeply flawed xpac overall and a pretty steep downgrade from tbc.
---
Cause Horde must be ugly and miserable by design.  Living is the pig pens make you feel like that.
---
U know what, i finally got my savage gladiator chain and just went and used mount money for lionheart, had to pay 200 g and buy some mats, totalling around 600 g. Probably would have bought an epic mount if not for this discussion xD
---
Whirlwind.. thunder clap, demo shout and battle shout, cleave, sunder everything. try and find a threat meter add on that will change the color of the nameplates of the mobs when you‚Äôre losing aggro so you can taunt or sunder right away.
---
rogue doesn't have a "spammable" aoe in vanilla
---
You learn infernal at 50 and doomguard at 60.
---
Also easier travel between cities
---
mAkE yOuR oWn GrOuP?
---
So you're saying that a tank who reservs ALL orbs in a strat living is being fairly paid compared to someone who's doing a quest in there?
---
I would be so damn happy if horde would be allowed to even do this grind...
---
We always do this.
---
Warlocks are kinda garbage before zg where they can get bloodvine
---
More treat allowes the dps to to more damage. Healers have to work harder but it speeds up the raid.
---
I will do.
---
WTF?!
---
TBH I bet most of the people in that guild run are only staying until they can find another guild.
---
That's not how that works at all.
---
For the most part yep. I think it was started by people who just didn't want to respec for pvp outside of raiding, and they tried it...and it worked because they were overheated for the content. But it's certainly not *ideal*.
---
Plus there are nice +threat talents in Prot, so it's not like Prot tanks don't bring the threat. They do.
---
OGRE HUNT! OGRE HUNT! OGRE HUNT!
---
Sorry if it feels braggy. English is not my native language.
---
The fact of the matter is that when I got Ironfoe everyone was like "OMG dude best tank weapon" but when I actually used it... it was VERY underwhelming. Unfortunately I cannot quantify feelings yet, which is a problem for a min maxer like me. I am therfore looking for a way to sim it and see the actual data. In the end I am just a MT looking to be the best I possibly can for my guild. 
---
At the moment I am considering to vendor it.
---
That's not for me to decide, that's for the people who joined the group to decide. Depends on many things, but mostly on the availability of an alternative tank.
---
People are forgetting about what the sever population actually was like back in vanilla. 
---
A low pop server now would be high pop back then. Things are kinda fucked balance wise with mobs, herbs, mining etc. Going to a lower pop server is probably very attractive for solo players and others.
---
Chatting shite. You need rogues. No one spell cleaves ubrs or dire maul. They'd all constantly compete for prebis otherwise.
---
Yes.  In MC they do OK but they scale terribly because they don't get as much from hit gear--they get a ton in the tree, they don't get much from crit gear--SWP and MF can not crit, they don't have good spell coefficients--the coefficient for SW:P is pretty good, but MF and MB are really bad, and there really isn't much gear that just gives a lot of raw spell power that they can make good use of.
---
He said that 3 times over the course of a couple hundred words...
---
U
---
Cool got no. You response so.
---
Don't know about your realm, but at least on mine there's a couple of guilds consisting of people with family, jobs and other IRL obligations - so many people in the same boat as you, basically. Probably people with an overall more chill attitude than the guilds you are describing, that's where I'd start. 
---
Healer here, I've not really ran any spellcleave or AoE-sque dungeons. The first few weeks there was a lot more of that going on, but it's mostly died down on my realm now. Either that or it's confined to some guild runs that aren't advertised - but my point is, I haven't seen any major issues as those you're describing. Sounds weird that it would still be going on at level 60 tbh.
---
I'm considering to lvl my druid. However, I'm a bit torn between him and my hunter. Both lvl fast, but also want a nice and fun play style. How is cat form Vs 2 mobs? Because that scenario is likely to happen a lot of times.
---
What a hateful trash of a comment, get a life?
---
I saw an addon where you can trade your inventory like a vendor. Maybe it's possible to use that to literally be a vending machine. Sadly can't recall the name.
---
Pretty sure dualwield tanking is meant for speedrunning
---
It's a problem if you ever want PvP. Not because of apes but because it's about 4:1 horde to alliance.
---
I was asking for Priest
---
Can‚Äôt be just me who vividly remembers pulling packs at range by tagging one then waiting for the rest to drop, then hitting it again right after? This is basically how I lvled my warrior and the reason why I bought a white crossbow at level 10.
---
Not saying I can‚Äôt be wrong of course
---
Tank? Sure.  Warriors are at a pretty significant disadvantage at 1 v 1.  Bad hunter?  Sure, I'll give you that too.  A good hunter has a pretty good shot against anyone though
---
swim bro
---
\*sad casual noises\*
---
They did.
---
Wanna give that 60 rogue away?
---
But no really man, you dont have to 'lead' a group to organize one.  
---
Just start it and spam the tells till you get what you need. More often then not your tank will know the instances anyway.  Now you can use your position to hopefully alleviate the frustrations of other melee dps who may be in the same boat. 
---
Command and Conquer friend.
---
Fury tanking makes it harder for the raid. But it speeds up the raid.
---
Dam I hope  my relm gets like that
---
"Why do Alliance keep transferring off the server?  There aren't 'THAT' many horde."
---
Gehennas?
---
I think you're on reddit too much instead of playing the game, because this aoe-meta isnt even a thing at lvl 60 dungeons.
---
Lmao game over...
---
Yeah right, but is shield slam not a good spell for threat generation? It's easier to generate threat with a fury build than a deep prot build?
---
Lol i love it
---
One thing I ended up doing after getting yelled at for taking 5-10 seconds to shield the eye was make a macro for it.
---
/tar Eye of Kilrogg
---
/cast Power Word: Shield
---
Warlocks friggin loved me for that. As soon as you see Warlock casting, spam that macro.
---
But have you tried hiding?
---
How do i see the faction distribution for whitemane
---
Sm/ruin is top tier for a reason.
---
15% increase to shadowbolt, and 100% increase in crit dmg.
---
I really hope he is main tank, it's the only time I think it's ok to funnel gear that hard into one person.
---
Other time would be to focus on finishing full tier sets on classes with an OP set bonus like shamans tier 1. Even then I would let people roll for items at the start and start to loot council pieces once someone starts getting close. It would be a bit less efficient but wouldn't piss people off.
---
My guild leader on the other hand is almost the opposite. He's the MT and let people roll on our first binding which went to a rogue which kinda gimps the raid as a whole since dps can only deal as much damage as the main tank can push threat.
---
I dont know why noone has posted this yet but the lashers are nerfed and not worth farming at all. Its not just the gold, its the exp as well. Dogs in north afaik are still giving good exp. You need to be 57 to farm them comfortably.

Echoing some other comments.  If someone expects money for crafting something, it isn't a tip it's a fee.
---
&gt; Nightfall and Annihilator swapping with totem twisting. I've heard it's valuable to have one in raid, but no more than that.
---
You heard somewhat wrongly. It's used in top guild for the first few days of a raid being released afterwards there is no good reason.

I love Shadow and hate pvp. Guess I'll die.

Warlocks are the embodiment of Dark Confidant form MTG. Greatness at any cost
---
Ragnaros is a fine example, 90 seconds is not a long fight, and melee need to move out every now and then so they don't have 100% uptime
---
Could be a little chiller about it, I was under the impression layering did not change capacity or queue times either. Though not confident enough on the subject to make a comment about it, seemed intuitive to me that removing layering would not affect queue times.
---
I can say with confidence that I'd pass on the mount, it looks silly on male orcs.
---
yup it's a really good video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7NWG9w8qWI
---
Why would you not have the scope?
---
Awesome ! Right now I have a custom tab where only /4 /LookingForGroup are unable for keeping my general tab clean.
---
So if I understand correctly this addons can replace this tab and provide me a better view of what is going on on my actual "tab"? If so, that's exactly what I was looking for !
---
Will do and thanks.
---
first of all nobody expects a babysitter when we play our mana/life minigame at least not those locks with brains who have understanding and knowledge of the game and don't stress the tank/healer unnecessarily. we have enough utilities to push our HP again up in the shortest time, healthstones, first aid, death coil and so on, if the healer thinks he would have to keep us at 100% at all times if we don't even have the first lifetap finished  it's nice but not goal leading for the group. I also tell this to my healers from time to time when I notice he overdoes it a bit. but if you have a strong group and almost flies through the dungeon and the healer is almost bored, I like to go a little more aggressive on the thing.
---
2) we do not drink, we eat. mostly souls now and then also milk bread.
---
3) Hellfire is indeed our best option at AOE. Rain of Fire is shit and the mana not worth.... the difference in damage is indeed enormous even if you do not know that. Depending on the situation I calculate my own death before the healer dies when the tank can not hold the aggro and there are already adds on the healer nobody cares because the tank sleeps or the Mages spams frostbolts instead of a Nova and starts also aoeing with the lock when we have 10 mobs on the ass.
---
you notice right after the first pull what kind of player your warlock is. every now and then a hot or a shield when we start Hellfire is welcome (if you are priest healer f.e.) otherwise let him die.
---
You can solo them at 53 in leveling gear, but you dont want to because they give shit exp. Please dont give advice when you dont know what you are talking about mate.

LF3M HoJ Farm. HoJ reserved. Got Healer!
---
Basically everyone was universally against layering for some reason, Blizzard seems to have listened to community and made removing layers a priority. Not everyone is gonna like the change back to nochanges
---
Druids can deal with 2 mobs very easily.
---
If it's melee, root. If it's ranged, you can probably kill the one mob and heal yourself before killing the other.
---
Druids are very versatile and have many tricks up their sleeve.
---
the ones that only want the gold should GREED, that is literally the meaning of greed.
---
But nowadays people only care for themselves and screw the community
---
Yes, rogue tanking is very much a thing [there's a whole guide](https://classicwow.live/guides/836/dodge-rogue-tanking-in-vanilla-rogue-tank-guide-by-caperfin) about it.
---
Cool, exactly the same crap you've been saying the entire time. Lots of justification, lots of hoops being jumped through, all boils down to the same thing: me me me, I want it, me. 
---
You just can't stand the thought that someone else could take and use something rather than a one in 5/10/40 chance of *you* getting it all to yourself.
---
It's sad man. Like I said earlier up, we gave our server first Quel'Serrar to the warrior in the group not one person thought for so much as a second of taking it, despite the fact they're now selling for over 1k each.
---
It's not about the threat when you go with 2/2 Imp. Overpower.  It's about either doing more damage when you're solo or to speed a dungeon along.  If you have threat issues in a dungeon while rocking a Prot spec of any kind, you're terrible.
---
As a rogue i think the drop that gave me the biggest issues was Cadeverous chest armor.
---
I think i did scholo close to 30 times to get that one.
---
I had a few issues getting the ring from Maraudon aswell, but i ended up buying a 60 10g, to run it with me until i got it, honestly the best gold ive spend in the game besides mount. 
---
HoJ tho? i started chilling in there at around lvl 55, and used BRD alot of level up, ofcourse i wanted HoJ, but until i dinged lvl 60, i wasnt intentionally aiming for BiS items, just having fun and getting exp, maybe finding some nice blues in the meanwhile.
---
I got HoJ in the third or so run, wasnt aiming for it or expecting it, just dropped. 
---
RNG is a fucking nightmare sometimes, but also insanely addictive... just one run more..
---
Some people just want to watch their E-peen grow...
---
1 copper then?
---
The drop rate is okay and there is usually a lot of people rolling for it. Having to reset instances means that you get locked out easier. By no means is reed "easy" bis to get.
---
For me I /pat unless it it's unnamed, then it's more *blap blap* than anything.
---
No offense, but zero people are running charity dungeons for pugs. They are doing it for their own loot and quests, with the understanding being its beneficial to everyone along the way.
---
Raw gold from vendoring is 50-60g/h. You also get a lot from mana/health pots and sometimes you find a quick buyer for a specific item from the chest.
---
Crushim was feared Into it
---
A blizzard GM should send him an ingame mail and demand a ransom in gold for not banning him.
---
You are presuming that your DPS are holding back. If that is not true then there is zero value in fury tanking.
---
There's literally a report player button on the mail menu for this exact reason.  This game has been around for a very long time.  I know it's not as polished and shiny as retail, but for the most part there are common sense solutions put in place for stuff like this.
---
When I see a gnome riding a saber I can't help wonder why it simply doesn't eat the gnome...
---
Strat living with orb reserved is also very good for money. Flask recipe, truefaith, daily increasing orb prices and daily increasing pristine black diamond prices.
---
That's false. Not only do Infernals live on, you can even give them commands while dead, provided the command hasn't ended yet.
---
They also definitely attack other players when the command ends. Their AOE aura will damage anyone in range too.
---
Great Work ! Thx buddy
---
I have myself never seen such entitlement from people. If an item is a clear upgrade that you will use for a while go right ahead. Equipping it is good form so you don't roll need just to sell it.
---
&gt; You didn't, it was a go for as long as you could before you died and the next guy picked it up. It was a matter of stacking everything for dodge and using your abilities then just dying
---
Someone posted a link to a Rogue Tank guide above your comment, weirdly enough it's possible.
---
There should always be room for 2 corruption on a boss, 3 if you are horde.
---
Once phase 3 comes out, the proc from the nightfall axe will take up 1 of those spots, but until then there is easily room to corruption bosses.
---
And demo shout is a waste on most bosses, giving even more room for corruption.
---
From what I heard feral actually has more mitigation (armor) at this point, and warrior has a harder time reaching the armor cap. The thing is when they both reach that cap warrior is just about all around better because of shield block, and even better on threat since their damage scales so much higher with gear. I only played a fury warrior, though I did dual wield tank some fights (full dps spec) after I got my t2.5 set. There is nothing that comes close to a fury warrior in full plate bis tanking threat wise. Though our feral tank with crowd pummeler on Vael was a unique exception.
---
1g/opened box is overpriced af especially for low level boxes..    
---
Concerning the crafts - it can't be said in general, it depends on rarity of the recipe. Baseline trainer recipes require just a symbolic tip or no tip(depends on person), but expensive recipes like blacksmith's Lionheart Helmet require a 75-100g tip (used to be 150g earlier).
---
It doesn't. Not only he's being an asshole about it, but he's also a moron.
---
Except BoE's are the opposite of rare. There's at least a couple of those daggers on AH at any given moment, maybe a dozen, depending on a server.
---
Would that rogue spend an arbitrary amount of 100g on an epic dagger that he will replace in 10-15 levels right after leaving that dungeon if the drop didn't occur? The answer is no. Is it an upgrade? Sure. Is it irreplaceable, or at the very least important for his next 15 levels? Absolutely not. He's better off using swords in combat spec anyways. So why should anyone else in a group pass on a liquid asset that is equally valuable to them?
---
If you'd actually cared for that rogue, you should have told him that the biggest mistake he could possibly do with that free BoE epic is to equip it. Would have saved that dude a ton of time.
---
Worthless info. Lasher farm is dead because of gold / exp nerf.
---
And how much do you charge for the item?
---
Big faction imbalance and raid groups farming honor aren't grounds for actual PvP.
---
Then why put Australia next to it in brackets? I don‚Äôt see the point
---
Amazing. This is exactly what I needed. You are a gentleman and a scholar.
---
Which is fine. The problem comes from ‚Äúi deserve this more then anyone else running the dungeon with me so I am going to reserve it‚Äù
---
This didn't happen and if U were actually playing at 60 you'd realise noone wants classes competing with them for loot and certain mobs are magic immune. Also aoe farming a large portion of level 60 dungeons isn't practical or efficient. Either you're terrible and people know it or you're farming karma.
---
You mean it resonates with you. A person does not resonate,  lol.
---
Oh shit I'm feeling it!
---
So if i play hordd im good? Cuz i play horde, so okay i guess i will join then. I hear BGs will be cross realm anyways so APES is a problem anyways
---
People who think paladins are poorly designed have no idea what they are talking about. Paladins are the hero class of vanilla
---
IF is better. You can fly south and north, Menetil Harbor is near in case if you need Kalimdor, there is a bank, AH and trainers.
---
Could probably multibox at least 6-8 characters on that 3950x alone if you VM them.
---
Always love to watch idiots fighting their way through as I fall into mc on the other side.
---
Yh esfand is pretty chill. He knows Ret pally sucks and is a meme and plays it up, but he's pretty nice to his guildies
---
30 days was some private server stuff
---
Simple rule of thumb is if you're doing something in a moral grey area that ruins the experience for someone else, you're probably going to get punished.  This is just straight up a dick move, and I'm not sure why someone would even do it to begin with.  Probably not a suspension on first time, but probably would be on 2nd.
---
What is a COD?
---
If you're going to equip your shield for the entire fight, just go Prot spec.
---
Also, from personal experience, you don't go DW Fury tanking without carrying a couple stacks of Greater Stoneshield Potions because they make up for the lost armor.  Generally, you can pop one at the start of a boss fight and by the time it runs out you will have such a solid threat lead that you can put your shield back on and finish the fight.  The tank in this video just seems like he watched a 5 min how to video and decided he could pull it off or something imo.
---
wow, well congrats it'll last you a bit. I am going to get mine in like a week or so. im waiting to see how the weekend arcanite bars get down to
---
this gives me warm fuzzy feelings
---
I‚Äôm personally very against multiboxing, and I wish blizzard was too. If it didn‚Äôt net them extra money from subscriptions, I would bet Blizzard would be against it.
---
It does affect it as blizzard generally will have to lower the population cap when disabling layering. If two layers are filled to the brim they can't just switch off layering with the same cap and expect the game to be playable.
---
thats what i was implying, i was being sarcastic
---
I remember losing a binding to some random 60 I was boosting through MC in cataclysm or so.
---
Yes, one reason to bring a rogue over others is for their class abilities.
---
sure, but you said if the chest contained a blue it would be rolled on
---
I hear you. Leveled as prot; I could block rogues and warriors to death, but if I ever saw a caster I usually just bubblehearthed out
---
They go pretty hardcore on scammers. It will likely be permanent.
---
I spent last night helping a guild member and three randoms with the sigil questline in Stromgarde (I was on the second to last quest, couldn't find a group for that, so I decided to just help someone catch up). So much fun, running around the keep with a good group and killing everything you come across. Ended up doing every role (we were two druids, took turns tanking and healing), and at one point we pulled about half the soldiers and had our two mages aoe them down.
---
It probably wasn't terribly efficient leveling, since I only got two quests done, but it was chaotic and fun :D
---
Oh right! I always forget about PvP.   
---
Yeah guess it's an ok set for battlegrounds. I've always been in PvE guilds, so I've never seen a piece of lawbringer equipped, it's always been shards/vendor.
---
I always liked to hang out in Darnassus (mage) despite the fact that the AH was far from the mailbox. But there were generally only a few people there.
---
Can't blame you, this is what 50IQ hordes live for.
---
This is why dual wield tanking has become popular. If your tank is decent, warriors will always beat rogues.
---
It's a life style, much as being Amish and eschewing technology is. I find both pretty stupid, but to each their own.
---
I spent 9 hours farming without a drop. You can still get unlucky
---
So I don't play a lock but what I have heard is that every lock damage spell is shadow apart from one (immolate I think?)
---
Therefore shadow damage gear is better as a piece which has (say) +21 damage/healing will have a higher number for shadow damage.
---
Yes it has queues. I usually log on before the queue though, starts around 5pm on weekdays. On the weekend when I logged in in the evening there was around 4.5k in queue
---
I just open the library door for them.
---
You are not mentioning what your role would be. I was 53 or 54 when I healed the first full run (can't recall), but that was with a 58 tank and some 55-59 DPS - and a lot of mana potions and drinking. If you're DPSing you'll have to be 55+ for a full run, if you're tanking, 57+ for full run. 53-54 would probably be enough to tank arena/anger if you've got some gear and a team to support.
---
if you are Alliance I guess, he is a low level Horde in Alliance territory, basically a siting duck.
---
Content right now is a joke either way.
---
Go outside org/IF, duel for a bit, say you ran out of water, a mage usually trades you some.
---
I'm a Tailor . If a Tailor pattern drops , I need, period
---
These also . . . What happpened to first orb reserved. . .na mate, all the orbs!
---
You're talking about ninjaing. This thread is about reserving items clearly from the start. They're two entirely separate issues, so we really need to avoid blurring the lines here. If a reserved item is clearly communicated from the start, then there should be no drama at all.
---
Guys are explaining it really hard and i think they even use the harder path.
---
Since you mostly go from bank-&gt; AH all you need to do is run east from the bank across the big bridge and jump down the first house on the right
---
No, the incredibly stubborn german horder players fucked up by not switching servers the first day of launch when they saw 20k queues :P
---
Some Horde areas are gonna be even worse than they were. PvP should go up aswell.
---
Gold&gt;Upgrades
---
Blegh.. Lawbringer is good stuff. World pvp is just around the corner, and the reason paladins are OP healers in pvp, is because of the plate. Lawbringer is good sht. - Quel'Serra, meh. Dont get me wrong; its amazing and im happy! But ill.mainly be using it singletarget, eg. never. Its simply too slow, the proc is mediocre and Ironfoe is a musthave. I would have gotten it eventually for aesthetics, but now it just litteraly dropped into my hands. - Im a pvper myself, so actually I would prefer the Lawbringer, but my time will come :)
---
Are coyotes good hunter pets? I tamed a random prairie alpha in Mulgore and named him Briarthron and I fucking love him to death despite having him for a total of about 45 minutes
---
As a tank, how do I tell if Hunter has growl on?
---
I just respec‚Äôd  Fury for the week after raids now i‚Äôm farming up gold for Lionheart and Skullflame..
---
All I can say is I wouldn‚Äôt roll on eye of shadow for the gold income - in bird language we call that ‚Äòa dick move‚Äô
---
I'm a lower level, I only ever ask for 1 stack of rank 3 water, I usually give 10 silver and nobody has demanded more yet, most mages give me several stacks and around half of them tell me to remove the tip I'm offering.
---
You probably meant Darkshore (Auberdine specifically), not Darkshire. :)
---
Ah, the 5 dk ramparts runs.
---
don't
---
Personally I am not joining groups that reserve all orbs to the tank, but I am more than happy to join groups that round robin orbs with first going to the tank.
---
Female humand and male gnomes are my highlights. This is nightmare stuff
---
They are identical but obviously only work for that school of magic.
---
I think the payoff for this is that the damage boost tends to be higher on equal level gear when it is only for one school.
---
No. I'm drunk. So now I have to pickpocket lockboxes to level up my lockpicking? That takes even longer than just going to the areas that supply lockboxes to pick. You're missing my initial point that I made.
---
Gehennas
---
That's just a hybrid problem. There isn't a hybrid in classic that's worth taking over a purist dps and there are near infinite mages and warriors right now.
---
This isn't an unpopular opinion.
---
The crit affects all attacks
---
Bettet dot than fear.
---
I have similar speccs but change processor to I9 and SSD to a 250GB with a 2TB Intel Optane HDD.
---
However, unlike him, I do have this mainly for gaming. Do note I play AC: Odyssey, Witcher etc. (I‚Äôm an RPG addict due to WoW, go figure huh?) all at 4k. And on my other monitor I‚Äôm playing grand strategy games like TW, Civ 5-6, CK2 or watching something. And trust me, these specs are not way too much. My rig can handle it, but just about. Ofc, I could just *not* run things at 4k with 60+ hz, but then that wouldn‚Äôt be very cashmoney now would it?
---
you don't get an upgrade.
---
you trade the item to gold in a extremly long process.
---
it might happen that the ah is filled with this overly priced item and you get undercut every time. your greedy because the gold does not necessarly focus on your item progress.
---
the other person just equips the item and has the upgrade.
---
You enjoy healing you say, and Ele gear is pretty much the same as for healing until 50s. Take your time leveling the shammy and enjoy it, and enjoy lvl 60 play. Do it.
---
Lmfao ligma

While it would be great if consumer phones came with that sort of directional beacon functionality, they don't, which is why drones like that can be fooled by someone sufficiently similar looking walking between you and the drone. 
---
GPS would be several orders of magnitude too inaccurate to be of use, *if* there was a system in place for telling the drone which GPS coordinates to go to such as a map or predetermined route. As it is, all it's commonly used for is a return to launch point functionality which is as likely to destroy the drone as it is to save it.
---
No one is gonna get pissed over that. We had a mage roll need on second wind just to annoy a healer in our guild. That type of crap is just dumb and makes everyone hate you.
---
I really wouldnt say that. Your tank has to be exceptionally geared if you dont want your heals to die from heart attacks in order to dual wield during progression.
---
If it's a healer, just cast drain mana to help them keep doing their job even while they're mind controlled.
---
In TBC me and my friend had such crappy internet that we could only play Arenas after midnight when the internet speed would get *slightly* faster. We also set up camp in Darnassus since loading Ironforge or Stormwind could result in a disconnect.
---
Hey - yeah sorry, I'm a PvE nutball myself so I always forget to consider PvP. Lawbringer's alright there. Just ironic you have to go to MC to get your PvP set - but then again, it's the exact same with tier 2.
---
At least he had enough imagination to pick a troll face nobody else uses.
---
this screws up so much just to fix a singular quest, the people doing this fix must be completely braindead
---
I hav no idea who Tips is, but I‚Äôm following Savix now, he seems like a chill dude!
---
I didn't even know that was possible in wow?
---
That is exactly what I was looking for too, and that is exactly what I made :DD Enjoy, friend.
---
mAkE yOuR oWn Name!

&gt; Airborne objects have to resolve less obstacles than something on the ground
---
Except when flying through a forest, tracking someone on the ground while avoiding both the trees the person on the ground needs to avoid and the branches that start further up.
---
If you dont set up 2fa you deserve to lose your account.
---
60. The mobs are 60. You will not even be able to attempt this until you are 60 with decent gear.
---
Ahahaha Jesus this has to be a joke right
---
What addons do u have for the ui? Like that dark tinted look, and is that a working trinket addon or just a bigger action bar?
---
Oh no... they got him /cry
---
He said retail *feels* dead - I have no doubt that it has more players. It's just that the world is empty, since everyone is teleporting around the place or at least flying, out of sight. Not to mention crossrealm-nonsense.
---
A shit mage yes. He should be spamming /combat blink
---
This doesn't answer his question, nor it contradicts its statement. Layering makes it possible for more players to play but what is its connection to the server limit is unknown.
---
I thought city's were always without layer, lol
---
I tanked a lot of SM over the weekend with several groups and I had everything -  "why no shield", "just DPS", "we could pull more", "STOP PULLING SO MANY", "I'll pull, wait here". I didn't mind, everyones different. But come Sunday when my IRL group of me and 3 friends 4 manned it, it was like heaven!
---
i kinda cba for 1g to be honest. Like before with rank 6 when you can craft 20 at a time it was okish, it was worth i guess, but know with rank 7 when i have to make 10 by 10, to stay there an conjure 120 i dont even bother anymore. The time it takes me to craft 120 waters i prolly can make more then 1g hehe.
---
Healers can't get groups for dire maul, but other instances are usually fine. But even that being the case, finding a tank can take 1-2 hours while finding a healer is usually 5 minutes max.
---
To sell to a real seller? Doesn't he mean buyer? What a fucktard. Just wait for the cod to expire.
---
where r the tomes?
---
I just killed Boss Tho'grun on my alt for "Seal of the Earth" doing this =)
---
Im guilty of teleporting myself to stormwind from the dwarven district
---
doesn't hemo spec contribute to physical dmg of the raid?

I think I used it right.
---
I think the only idiot here is you sir, an ignorant idiot too. People have had their accounts compromised even with an authenticator, though it is extremely unlikely to happen, it still can. 
---
Some blizzard employees are actually clueless and will uphold bans because they have no idea how something works. There was a post by a multi boxer a couple of weeks back proving exactly this (the cluelessness of some GMs).
---
There was another post around the same time about a guy receiving a false warning on his account for gadgetzan safespotting that he did not take part in. He was lucky to be noticed by a GM on reddit and received an apology and game time and had the warning removed.
---
&gt;You're absolutely right. Getting a computer to recognise one object is not hard nowadays. Getting it to recognise a whole class of objects is an entirely different matter.
---
Which is why games are so much easier. 
---
*All* objects are already known. They're in a folder on your harddrive, ready for data mining. The objects of interest even cause your mouse cursor to change and provide their own name on hover.
---
This is not unpopular, this is expected unless stated otherwise.
---
If you want to speed dungeons along just 2h arms tank.
---
Then you dont understand how the company works if you dont think money is the #1 deciding factor over every decision.
---
Why Badlands?
---
You can try and do lashers. Im a 54 mage and cand do them and it's easy. 
---
My current xp/hr is around 40k but i only did a few runs and am sure this can be improved.
---
Maybe you missed the addition of like 30 more servers after launch, which also affects queues heavily. And another major thing is that is not about less players, but less player activity. Virtually everyone was playing 10-12 hrs / day in the first 2 weeks, and dropping their activity to 2-3 hrs / day afterwards.
---
The supposed "massive drop" in player numbers did not happen. What happened was a small drop in player base, a normal drop in player activity, the addition of roughly 30% more realms after launch and free transfers.
---
I would bet that Classic only lost around 10% of the launch numbers, those 10% being retail players. Maybe 15%, but I don't think it was that high.
---
We don't have queues anymore simply because there were more servers added, player activity dropped to normal levels and free transfers.
---
Classic, tripling the number of WoW subs, which means that 66% of the WoW player base are Classic players, and 33% Retail players (so, Classic is twice as big), is still virtually as big as it was at launch....it's just that Classic have much more servers today, coupled with free transfers and normalized player activity.
---
Priest here that‚Äôs recently respecced to shadow spec at lvl 40 on the back of popular advice ..... and I‚Äôm a little underwhelmed. While I‚Äôm (marginally) killing things somewhat quicker I‚Äôm also depleting my mana ALOT quicker too. I open with PW:S, mind blast, SW:P, a few mind flays and finish off with wand.
---
Am I doing something wrong? Because outside of world pvp I don‚Äôt really feel it‚Äôs an improvement, it feels my older disc hybrid build was more sustainable since I never really had mana issues going from mob to mob.
---
I haven't seen a capital city look like that since BC. If layers are gone for real I might jump back in.
---
&gt;I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre fixing Solenar, but it stinks that they have to change all mobs. You could definitely split a group in Vanilla by kiting and only damaging one mob until the others reset.
---
It is possible that this only applies to mobs that are linked to always engage together. It might not effect just regular getting multiple mobs on a pull.
---
There are many earths but only one earthshaker!
---
*whipped*
---
but on the bright side, you can now give her whipped cream
---
You can do the turtles at the beach in Hinterlands. If you have skinning its some decent extra gold. 
---
My advise is to join Brd exp runs from 52 and higher.
---
That is the best exp you are able to get.
---
Yeah I thought 25% would be amazing compared to DM buff.. got like 100 hp.
---
or you know, we're just pretending to be various extremes for comedic effect.
---
*Cries in Darnassus*.
---
Yeah. SW to IF is probably the best one out there. But going from SW/IF to Darnassus is conversely the worse.
---
Whereas for Horde the three aren‚Äôt too bad.
---
Its like Blizz gave everything too good for the tram so in return they made getting to Darnassus an absolute bitch, whereas Horde takes no.2,3 and 4 whilst no.5 and no.6 is IF to Darnassus and Sw to Darnassus respectively.
---
Fair enough, just wanted to provide another angle - I agree!
---
Part of the game is designed around hurting other players in PvP (player versus player) combat. It can be quite annoying to deal with this, but PvE (player vs emotions) servers may be right up your alley.
---
"Sell to a real seller"  
---
Bruh
---
That's never really a factor. Or, well, once.
---
That would be goblins.
---
imagine being alliance baby crying for a report instead ( Õ°~ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
This is amazing I love it! I feel like a bit of a dick for asking, but if you draw just for fun any chance you could do my friends druid? She would be ecstatic if she was surprised with a fantastic drawing like this... and I think I could get her reaction on stream
---
I‚Äôd roll shaman because you‚Äôll get geared way quicker than a clothie with the outrageous amount of mages playing the game to level quickly with aoe
---
You are highly encouraged to not give a damn.
---
Horde has way better pvp racials, though.
---
Mostly private server players. If any of them played Vanilla they were probably like 12 years old and not even max level.
---
Ye and 2hr+ queue if you login around 5pm CET!
---
Look, you have two parties. One that doesn't want to roll against people for gear, and one that doesn't mind it. The only real middle ground is reserving so you don't exclude 100% of classes that might compete with you for said gear.
---
The ratio between Classic and BfA player base is at least 2 to 1, if not 3 to 1.
---
 /dnd tank service: Strat living= orbs, scholomanse= dark runes etc.
---
As a tank with a shortage this big you can reserve basicly everything you want.
---
With √Ärth√°s, √Çrth√•s, √Ñrth√¢s, √Érth√†s and √Årth√§s!
---
Your talking about most servers now though since they decided not to release BG's in phase 2.
---
Mograine is solid, pretty good community and the balance seems good to me at 60. Not sure about PVP guilds tho
---
yeah, alliance on dreadmist are cool, problem is with the hordies that will gank you on any given chance, even if you are 20 levels below them ;p
---
Ah yes, typo in mobile haha
---
The addons ClassicLFG as well as Group Bulletin Board basically summarize and filter all chat messages from city, trade, local and lfg channels and present you a consolidated (and optionally filtered) view of all people searching groups. It helps a lot. But just getting into the lfg channel should be the major issue you had.
---
Also note that consecutive flight paths came somewhen in vanilla wow, can't tell you when though. When I started in February 05 it was not in, but it absolutely was in somewhere before Naxxramas came out.
---
We have different idea what huge is. You have massive mmorpg with gigantic lore, dozens of cities and dungeon with hunred quests to explore but you miss the "huge" part of probably broken spell. I mean, people can be so hysterical nowadays. Thats huge.
---
Boohoo.
---
Real men mindblast.
---
Wow well not joining
---
Come to heartseeker!! Most alliance I know leave leveling players alone because we don‚Äôt want them to quit before phase2
---
do you suggest switching to enhancement at all for leveling or is that not a good idea considering i plan on healing endgame and it is best to gather int gear as a priority?
---
Ehm no, everyone should pay attention to everyone , it's like you're tryin to Say DPS have no voice in this.
---
If you're tanking or healing like an ape, I'll notice mate
---
Oh man
---
yes, the cloth competition is a concern of mine.
---
It is acceptable. If you need them and win you equip.

If you don't or agree on different loot rules beforehand you follow that.

60 moonglow-resto druid here. Farmed my Pre-raid BiS (all except two items) so I have +560something healing. My Rejuv ticks for well over 300. Regrowth ticks for almost 300. I'm one of the top healers in our guild. We didn't have BiS lists in vanilla, so druids are much better this time around since we can get nearly +600 healing before even stepping foot into a raid. 
---
In dungeons I mainly just throw HoTs on the tank and jump around while being bored until the mage gets aggro. Sometimes I level my weapon skills, because there's nothing else to do.
---
The only downside about being a resto druid is that it's very difficult to find a dungeon group (because we only have res every 30 minutes). Which, to me, is a bit odd.   
---
The majority of deaths come from asspulling mobs, in which case it's a full wipe. Or mages who think they're invincible and die right before my heal lands. The whole "we want someone who can res" mindset has a lot to do with laziness. "I want to go full ham and I don't want to care about dying". Mages and locks don't want to use defensive abilities. I've had locks tell me that they don't want want to use drain life because it lowers their dps. It's fucking scholomance, who cares. And I very rarely see mages who use Ice block. If you drop to 15% hp within 2 seconds because you aggroed 3 elites, how about putting in an effort to save yourself? Just a thought.
---
I never had this problem in vanilla (maybe because people didn't care about min-maxing, were more careful in dungeons, and knew that DPS meters only matters in raids). And, I've mainly only seen this with Dire Maul. I've been considering speccing to feral in between raids just to get groups.
---
You shouldnt be allowed to touch the floor while entering MC. FLOORS LAVA
---
Completely agree, you articulated this well.
---
Everything is pretty camper during peak hours but it‚Äôs offset by inflated prices. Elemental fires go for 4.5g+. Golden pearls for 45g. Essence of water for 23g. I‚Äôm going to guess prices are much lower than that on yours
---
If you are in Cath and telling about dps meters, you‚Äôre a tool. And quite honestly yes, if you‚Äôre throwing a fit in raids over DPS, you‚Äôre also a tool. Unless it‚Äôs something absolutely egregious, it‚Äôs not going to make that much of a difference.
---
\- Who the hell would ever play classic 15 years after the release and furthermore 2-3 months after re-release .... -
---
1 decision can greatly affect the future of one company. 
---
I myself am so glad that I have the opportunity to relieve some moments that some devs worked hard to give it life.
---
Or both. That‚Äôs the play for AQ/Naxx
---
Sap is only good cc if you're a sub rogue. Other than that it will break stealth.
---
Lmao that's brilliant, i didn't know that
---
Me? You‚Äôre the one implying that you deserve BoE‚Äôs over everyone else by virtue of them being upgrade to you. I‚Äôm saying that everyone should have a shot, given that everyone can realize the full market value of such item and subsequently buy a usable item of equal worth.
---
If anything, you‚Äôre the opportunist who wants to reserve BoE‚Äôs for the sake of not having to cough up the market price on the AH.

He still has to figure out there is no barber in classic

Yeah, keep pushing the timeline.
---
From "Classic will be a niche game" in 2016,  to "DoA" in 2018 to "Dead in 2 weeks after nostalgia wears off" in 2019, now it's 4 months?

I bet that when it will NOT happen in 4 months, you will come here and say what? That once Naxx is on farm , players will quit?

Are you trying to join UBRS or BRD? Those are the two dungeons at 60 with waaaaay to many melee in them, because casters need like 1 item and never run them again, while melee do it forever. Any other dungeon should be easy to get a group for.
---
To get BRD/UBRS you either have to have friends/guild witch you seem to not put in any effort into doing.. Or make your own group (probably reserving an item you need because 7/10 will be melee in an UBRS group).

You doing the chain for Dartol's rod? best item in the game

&gt; Back in vanilla I had 512MB of RAM, a 2GHz single core Celeron R processor and no discrete graphics.
---
What's positively frightening is that the first computer I played WoW on (at release) was an Apple PowerBook Ti with a 1Ghz PPC processor and 512MB of RAM.
---
I'd hearth back to Org and walk away for a few minutes while my hard drive thrashed and my massive 64MB of VRAM rendered the city.
---
I can't believe I actually fucking raided on that laptop.
---
Find a guild. Stop puggin. Fuck this shit reserved party.
---
hahahaha hahahahaha wow.
---
I got, you got...
---
i have no way to farm gold as a prot warrior other than jumpruns(which are way too rng) and reserving orbs in strat live. People gladly join my strat runs, for thier pre-bis and quests completed, why is that a bad thing?

Ha!

Fuck mages

Jack's whispering in her ear: "You know, that door was large enough for the two of us."

this sounds awesome, I'm always wondering what my heals do, i was watching a video of vanilla pvp videos, just wondering if you know of, or can create, an add on to show what buffs an enemy gains, like in pvp
---
It doesn't work like that in Classic, only retail. Also humans don't have a free trinket until WotLK, in Classic their activated racial increases stealth detection for some seconds.
---
*DingDingDing*
---
Haven't heard that one before
---
See if the growl debuff is applied to the mob.
---
Exactly!  Work on getting your epic mount and all your gear enchanted and such first.  I'm pretty sure no class is capable of producing more threat than a well-played Prot spec Warrior at this phase of the game so long as you're giving the tank a few seconds head start.  Warriors tanked everything in the game using 1h/shield back in Vanilla, and I've watched Warriors tank everything just fine on private servers using just a 1h/shield combo.  Main tanks always had a shield on if it was a progression fight.  DW Fury was that thing we did after we had Nef on farm and were still fishing for bindings or rare pieces like Onslaught Girdle and MC was a mindless joke we were so overgeared and had our strats down pat.
---
&gt; t's sort of a dick move because anyone could have taken that BoE and converted into gold to buy their own BoE.
---
Might aswel never not need then. This is a shitty mentality
---
yo how do u get 3 chars to level 60 and still have a gf?
---
You didn't sheep it?
---
Only if you wish to - I lvld as Enh to 52 and then went resto, but had to carry 2 sets of gear for healing dungeons. Personal preference. I think Ele trumps Enh from 40 onwards for leveling. Less RNG.
---
Why is it a waste before naxx, but not in naxx? Because fights are longer?
---
From the get go removing layers was always a priority. It was only there to ease the launch
---
Haha that's what I've been doing, but I'd like it to be interactive with the movement of my character.
---
LunaUI is also a good alternative.

I played pretty aggressively for the first couple of weeks and got up to 40, since then every level has taken me between 4-6 hours and I slowed down a lot. More recently since getting to lvl 50 they've been taking around 8 hours per level. Since then I've only really been getting to play at the weekends since the idea of coming home from work at night and then grinding exp all evening really deterred me, so what I started doing is this.
---
Playing only at weekends and letting the rested exp gather up over the weekdays.
---
I'd log in at the weekend with like 1.5-2 lvls of rested and blaze through the levels quickly whilst still retaining my sanity, and the break through the week rekindled the spark of enjoyment that I needed to have fun whilst lvling again.
---
I hit 60 yesterday and did Onyxia the same night.
---
The way I look at it is that now I'm gonna be able to log in on weekday nights again and enjoy playing because I know I don't have the huge looming grind in front of me. So I get to enjoy the game again!
---
Didn't Blizzard say pretty much this in a post somewhere? Perhaps the classic wow reddit should reflect that and allow "witch hunts" to a degree.
---
Let's see who has more gold if everyone buys from this dude and nobody from you...
---
Don't use more than one mindflay, or two against tougher mobs. If you're not wanding for the last 40% you're going to run oom.
---
The bot you've found sounds way more complicated than the ones I've seen down there.
---
I've seen Hunters (4 different ones to he exact) at level 37-39 there.  They, however, sit at one cage nearest the dock where patrols don't exist.  Everytime it soawns they instantly loot it .
---
When attacked, their pet jumps in for the kill.  They are programmed to heal their pet every interval and do so even when the pet isnt being attacked.
---
I've seen them die. Ive reported them all.  A new one always shows back up.
---
the thing with warriors is that their 'main' dps spec involves leather etc, and their offspec is plate nobody will need anyway - unless they bring another dps warrior along or a pally on alliance.
---
You can fix name issues already.  Delete the character, have a friend make a new character with that name you deleted.  Recover the character and itll tell you to replace the name as a character exists with the name.  Might need to be 10+ to recover the character.  Dont think you can customize haircuts etc though just the name.  It's also only usable once every 30 days and uses up a restoration charge (replenishes every 30 days)
---
What server you on?
---
Mate are you unable to read? I play the game, I enjoy the game but you circlejerkers constantly acting like you're fighting against some machine that wants you to fail is pathetic.
---
what's a good purchasing price?
---
He got his Warrior up to 34 or something like that.  Said so in one of his earlier videos when he was playing private servers and had just gotten laid off work and was trying out content creating.  Everything the guy has ever said about Vanilla/private servers/Classic has been regurgitated from other people who actually did those things.
---
Hunter is far from braindead if you don't afk Autos hot farm
---
Because the scheduled phases are planned to take two years at least. Maybe even 2 and a half before all phases are released.
---
Which means, if TBC comes, it won't come until classic had hit phase 6 and is dying out.
---
Also, who are you to say what is worth it and not?
---
How important is the best gear you can get, for you? It's his time and his choice.
---

/thread
---
Threat is starting to be an issue for top guilds now that DM is out, although most top guilds are already running one DW fury tank. Maybe for horde it's a bit different, but our paladins have no issues keeping our DW tank up and this allows our DPS to come with full world buffs/consumes and blow up the boss without ever pulling agro.
---
It feels dead because it is. Make no mistake, Classic have like 3 times more players on 1/3rd of the servers, compared to Retail. With no sharding. Which means like 9 times more players in a capital city in Classic vs Retail major hubs.
---
Even with 10-12 servers connected in Retail, a major hub in Retail will not even have 1/10th of players that are present in Org or IF in Classic.
---
This definitly never used to happen, at least on my vanilla to wotlk server. I got a lot of good raid gear from instance grinding back then and I never saw reserving even once.
---
I think people are just too impatient these days. We used to run instances every so often; if we got an item that was 1% better than what we had than great, if not than it didn't really matter,just the luck of the draw. 
---
I mean sure maybe it was different for top tier progression raiders; but realistically that's not a concern for 99.9% of people.
---
I did a mean sap a while ago, some Horde Warrior was fighting the pirates in Tanaris, he just beat a bunch of mobs and stopped to eat at really low HP, I didn't gank him, I just sapped him over and over when he tried eating, and then mobs respawned while he was sapped.
---
Idk I out damage most casters honestly. They just don't have that much hit and shadow gets 10% through talents. Once they start catching up out lack of crit being useful will catch up and we will become far worse, but in current content shadow is pretty good.
---
This reddit. Deets or gtfo
---
Yes.
---
From my experience, people who play these niche specs tend to put more into consumables than people who play the generally more accepted classes in raids. They‚Äôre harder to make competitive but all the power to those who can make it work!
---
Shadowform is overhyped for leveling from my experience. It's a must for dungeons and raids if you're dps but it's easier to find groups as a healer anyway.
---
Disc/shadow is indeed the way to go.
---
There is already an addon that lets you make notes about people, think its called noteit or something
---
I like the way you think.
---
Thunderfury bar none
---
Soo.. you are saying there are limits. If you had layers, you could go around that with server performance, fuck, even use multiple physical servers to have the performance you needed.
---
People here claim that layers have zero effect to layer capacity. One layer has a LIMIT how many people it can hold without lagging. Multiple layers can avoid that limit. How fucking hard is that to some people understand.
---
yeah the RNG is the reason i didn't roll Enh from the start...but ele is a bit weak at the level i'm at....and trying to cast while getting smashed in the face by mobs isn't fun.
---
I rolled a 7 on my t2 helm yesterday too mate and lost it. 
---
You lost something that you didn't have to begin with.
---
Hope that helps in some way......?
---
Yes, even life tap and dark pact get better with more shadow dmg. Fire dmg is only good for immolate and conflagrate.
---
Retail is a midget compared to Classic. Classic is 3-4 times bigger than Retail.
---
On some servers yes. Though they seem to have fiddled with it, leaving group now resets you to your old layer. Maybe that was done in preparation for removing the second layer.
---
Rip in peace.
---
Very good point. If a run is advertised as having a reserved item, and there are still plenty of people willing to join and complete the run for their own reasons, then clearly the reservation wasn't an issue at all. It's baffling how the /r/classicwow community getting upset over something so simple.
---
The only party invites I get start with ‚Äúwanna heal?‚Äù
---
It did. They named the actual ship something serious, and the research sub Boaty McBoatface.
---
I mean you gear your tank first for a reason.
---
As others stated i might have been impatient or could have created my own groups without leading them afterwards. But dont tell me what i¬¥ve seen and what not, calling me a liar. Thats ignorance at its finest, the same ignorance which let me cancel my sub.
---
And its not about aoe farming. Its about the aoe utitlity these rDDs bring into the group so you dont have to CC much etc. People seem too lazy on my realm (Transcendence) and wanna basicly blizzard-slow-aoe-kite-tank all trash groups with a mage. Even had a discussion about this with a warrior tank the other day in lbrs. He kept complaining we would need a mage since everything is taking too long. We were rogue, hunter, WL. That was the setup. And he kept crying for a mage. What i experienced in lfg/world chat adds to this impression of people being obsessed of mages. Atleast on my realm.
---
So again: Dont tell me what I have actualy seen.
---
Wait what!? Damn, that's news to me.
---
It costs like 33g. The book + 30g cash. Other mats are BoP. Though i guess it's possible some servers have people running manip on the books, but on mine they're bottomed out.
---
Hey man, great addon.  
---
A couple small UX points...  
---
1. When I select "All" from the filter list, I should still be able to de-select one of the dungeons, and have "All" de-select from the filter list (This is a standard checkbox input pattern).
---
2. It would be great if my selections persisted through changing between dungeon/raid/bg, currently swapping resets my dungeons to "All".
---
3. I'd love to be able to move the frame around ;)
---
Layering is shit
---
If people can skip mc it means raiding is too easy. 
---
&gt;And the time line on the game will compress as people will clear naxx quicker and get bored with the game quicker.
---
As opposed to getting bored waiting 6 months for a new raid?
---
You seem pretty controlling over how people are supposed to enjoy the game.
---
Cant disagree
---
*step brothers voice* did we just become best friends?

Yes, the only difference is you don't get to boost your fire spells, but RoF/hellfire have pathetic coefficients and other fire spells aren't as relevant.

If I'm grinding solo I'll sac void for a constant 3% heal every 4 sec.  That's about 100hp/4sec for me.  If going to DireMaul solo I'll also pop a trolls blood (12hp/5sec) and sometimes wear that trinket +5hp &amp; mp every 5 sec) or so.  You basically never have downtime.  Lots of life tap.
---
If I'm raiding it's 100% sac succubus because 15% extra shadow damage is great.  If I'm AoE farming it's sac imp for 15% fire damage.

---
Are you serious? It's 45% Ally to 55% horde. It's even worse at 60. How does it have good balance?
---
Uh why? On pve servers, people can just /pvp if they want to do pvp. People not interested in gaining honor or - more related to your posting I think - being gank fodder won't. But those that want to participate will have to flag themselves.

Group leaders tailoring their groups to optimise the run. God forbid!

If you only play for gear, which ireally sounds like the case, then you won't have a good time in Classic. I suggest adjusting your mindset or taking a break from the game :)

Aye I know what you mean the drop rate is vastly different agreed, I'm pretty much relying on pugs to raid at the moment though since my guild is far from ready to raid so still tough for me üòÖ
---
Hope that you get some good luck coming your way soon, never know it might pop up again in the next run!
---
Stop playing if you dont want to play. I dont get people asking internet to make decisions for them. Thenagain purely raidlogging takes like couple hours a week. Phase 2 isnt going to be super long, so this hiatus is going to cost you like 2-4 months worth of subs, depending when they start.
---
why would it be ludicrous to equip a Krol Blade? I just did it yesterday. I'm not about to farm a 4% drop rate Dal'Rend that everyone and their mother needs, and I don't have any other good choices outside of raids - and who knows when I'll get the raid swords considering I always roll against 10 people, even if they drop.

U know its the old grind honor system and not the one where u spend honor points for gear? Its up to you but i want my WL be geared nice for the grind :)

if you are set with a name for classic and got it on the first and only server at that time, you will for sure play there if you don't get it on the second.

When the hype for classic started I watched almost every single vid from beta and other stuff. I discovered great content from beautiful people like madseason and platinum wow. Suddenly I stumbled across this guy tips out. Oh wow he got interviews from blizzard stuff about classic. He seems to know what he is talking about. Until I watched a priest healing guide full of errors and false claims. Maybe he had a bad day but no, the other guides were even worse. He is toxic, unfriendly and seems to have no clue what he is talking about. Never watch a single vid from him again

Hai\^\^ we actually spend as much time as possible together. We are in long distance relationship and having stupid time difference : \[ . We usually have few hours a day in which we leave everythign we do and chat/talking etc , watching movies. We making it work :P. I'm actually pretty casual WoW player. I usually level up on the background when im working or when i have time at home \^\^ as i said i jsut didnt wasted much time when i was leveling. I went from point A to point B without stopping at point C if you know what i mean lol

It depends, there are some epics in MC where you get 4 out of it.. but you're right on keeping them for phase 5.

Apes like to do a SHOW that they record and put into youtube. Then they disappear and you wont see any of them for 1-2 weeks. So they do like DM opening with their side bitch, salad bakers, aoe the doorway for few hours. After that one night of "look we are here", you wouldnt even know they ever were there.
---
Same thing in BRM, they will have 3-5 raids worth of guys waiting to kill anyone raiding with buffs. They specifically seem to go after certain guilds. Since theres generally quite a bit more of horde, usually horde guilds dont bother getting people together, aka when they run into BRM, they are suddenly facing 1:3 or 1:4 odds.
---
So what happens in P2. Apes will roam in big groups. But then horde will actively try to PVP too (compared to now). Not going to be any different than any other PVP server. Its gonna be a shitshow if you playing alone. Flymasters and GY's will be camped. People are going to get ganked, a LOT. If you dont want that, go to a PVE server.
---
TL'DR, non issue 98% of the time.
---
I haven't had luck getting that drop, which blows
---
Blizzard throws out bans like hotcakes.  They're worse than twitch.
---
That said nost bans seem to be a short period since they want you to keep paying.
---
Waow this has never been posted before, ever.
---
Pity that classic wow died a month after launch, so this will never happen.
---
Raid is not more important than a real life relationship :P i can live without a piece of epic gear :)
---
You didn't lose it, you never had it.
---
I was thinking about this before.  On my server an orb is only worth 25-30g.  The run will take a good hour, so the tank is only making 25g per run.  25 gold per hour isn't a lot.
---
 That's even assuming an orb drops.   I've been in several without an orb, and one with 4 orbs.   The average is probably only slightly higher than 1.
---
Those guys don‚Äôt know what the word ‚Äúgreed‚Äù means. Greed is for money.

You can go to the wetlands and farm dark iron dwarves (also around level 28, elites). You should make a nice profit and experience!

"You guys getting paid?"
---
Not yet. As stated before, I'm currently trying to find a way to make this possible. Currently it shows your heals on the players' unit frames just like implemented by blizzard in later Addons.

&gt; but why would you even optimize for those (especially as a healer) over future BWL?   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; For longer fights, spirit is king. Especially since you'll have 3T2 by then. 
---
Idk, maybe because BWL won't be released until the end of Q1 next year?
---
VENDOR ALL YOUR GEAR
---
Interestingly I did a quick bit of maths yesterday after this comment.
---
* You must run Angerforge 14 times before the chance of a HOJ dropping is higher than it NOT dropping.
---
* If you run 30 times, there's an 80% chance it will drop.
---
Tsm
---
I really like your addon, but I use russian language and almost ALL chars are "?"
---
So it looks like:
---
??? ?????? 2 gold per hour ???? ???? ???
---
etc  
---
Can you fix it please?
---
Modern problems require modern solutions!
---
Beautiful.
---
I scammed a guy like this once selling an Ace of spades card. 
---
He cod it to me for 90 gold and I waited for like 2 days. I went on the AH, bought a different number of the card with the same icon and CODed it back to him for the same amount. He took the bait thinking it was just being returned. So with the gold I just used it to buy his card. 
---
He threatened to report me and raged at me then went offline. I added him to my friends list and he never came back online. LMAO
---
This was on the private server btw, never got banned
---
The reason is simple. Layering removes the the whole tought of one consistent world. This is good for the community as you see the same people all around and the resource struggle is real!
---
Solo/5-mans I would opt for agony if you are playing affliction. For raids you will likely be assigned a curse anyway.
---
Yesterday I lost a staff of dominance with 1 point difference in the roll...
---
The client is basically irrelevant to the question.  The client won't be stressed at all unless you're running on some very old hardware - next time you're playing the game open up Task Manager and look at the metrics.
---
As for the servers, I don't know the exact setup, obviously, but I'd be very surprised if in 2019 they aren't using cloud services, either their own proprietory service or a third party (e.g. Azure or AWS)
---
With cloud services you can either scale up or scale out with very little latency.  Scaling out means adding more servers, scaling up means increasing the power of each server.
---
This means that in theory each realm could probably easily support dozens and dozens of layers but the only reason they don't do that is that at some point they have to go to one single layer.
---
You are correct. You can roll need on BoE's if you will equip them straight away and demonstrate to your party members that you're actually going to use them and not sell them on the AH, which you cant do once you've equipped them.
---
I'll bet you would. He's a charmer though
---
No. Only until the day of prophecy.  Then we shall switch to posting pictures of empty Ironforge...
---
Shadow v agony, how long is the fight? 
---
Yea it makes drain life stronger, it‚Äôs a shadow spell
---
On balanced horde alliance ratio guilds its a big pvp event.
---
On unbalanced servers its the first guild who tags it.
---
Ok well honestly that seems fun so maybe i will consider joining
---
I rolled need on a boe cloth pair of boots from DM yesterday that were a clear upgrade for me and equipped immediately.  
---
My group didn‚Äôt complain but a couple of them said they would rather have sold them on ah.  Just found it weird that gold is more of a priority than character improvement.
---
Yeah, it has absurd queues. They start around 4pm GMT+1 and ramp up pretty fast to 3k. If you have a job and are planning to play, then don‚Äôt roll a toon on Gehennas. Chances are that you‚Äôre waiting till 9 or 10pm to get in. 
---
Try Mograine.
---
awww &lt;3 Thank you so much \^\^ your comment made me smile too and that honestly made my whole day :)  Thank you so much for your warm wishes :P
---
Shield slam is basically a second taunt and it is the highest threat generation you can get other than a taunt. I love it. It will pull a mob back to you about 90% of the time, especially so if it crits. It‚Äôs not totally necessary but it‚Äôs definitely useful if you don‚Äôt want to sit around waiting on your taunt to come back up.
---
If you run with the same people a lot, and you should, then you build up a level of trust with them by rolling need only on upgrades that you will equip
---
They increased the server cap by about 10k because of the long queues.
---
Normally I don't mind random sapping too much, since I usually catch them with a random AE sooner or later anyway.
---
But I do have one horrible, horrible memory of sap. There was one particular patch during TBC in which it didn't flag you for PvP. I played on a PvE server and liked to hang around in Goldshire with a few other friends (Horde). That patch was a nightmarish torture of low level rogues repeatedly sapping us.
---
If your sole goal is 100 percent Nightfall uptime, there is non better. Realistically, no Hunter is going to do it because fuck that noise in every way possible.
---
Horde side, hey it‚Äôs an Axe and some Warrior can do 2H Fury and still do great DPS with a ton of uptime. Shit, give it to an Enhance Shaman and the uptime goes down further but it‚Äôs still decent.
---
Alliance side it‚Äôs a bit worse on Warriors as you can‚Äôt fish for Windfury with Hamstring, but the Slam spec is one of the funner non-meta builds. Tons of Ret Paladins who can wield it, and they aren‚Äôt great at proccing, but, Seal of Righteousness gives you double the chance of proccing in every attack. With Spellpower gear they are good dps (for a hybrid) and bring a big buff to the raid outside of Nightfall. (If you have 4-5 Paladins total you can get Salv, Kings, Might/Wisdom, Light on all players. Swap Salv for Sanctuary on the tanks)
---
Tried paying a priest 25g to pass the wand from school, he still rolled need and I lost to his 20 something roll. Then I started putting wand on res, tipping everyone 25g if it drops, still didn't get it. When I finally got it in a random put with no loot on res, I was so happy I wouldn't need to deal with that place anymore I just tipped everyone 10g even though a lock rolled need on it.
---
I would never res all orbs to tanks.
---
The tank gets ONE orb, two if the group is really fucking desperate to get one. 
---
Er, i'm not sure you play warrior but if I run a strat dead i'm paying nearly 4g for a repair bill by the end of it without a wipe. On average from silver drops you get almost 4g per run before you sell anything you got.
---
But it isn't uncommon to die once or twice as a tank if someone pulls extra or a healer is derping. You will more often then not lose money if you do random dungeons with brain dead dps. 
---
Also there isn't a healer shortage like the tank shortage. I can log on any time of the day and see a ton of "LF tank g2g!" but I don't think i've seen a "LF healer g2g!" since like 20-30
---
On my server I can usually get away with all the orbs, especially if I see a group LF Tank for quite some time in /LFG.
---
I haven't needed to run Strat Live since. Well, never, since literally nothing I've ever wanted as Warrior drops there (I know there are some half-decent items, but there are better drops than those in other dungeons).
---
Because of this, I've only ever run Strat Live as a means to grind gold, so if people are willing to let me have all the orbs, then I don't mind that at all. If people were only willing to let me have first 1 or 2 orbs, then that's what I would go for, but I often fill a group in 5-10 min with all orbs reserved, so there's no reason not to. I get gold and the other people get a quick and smooth run for their BIS piece(s) and/or quests.
---
I lost the roll, you know, the little mini game in which whoever rolls the highest wins the thing, I'm surprised you've never played it tbh
---
role play
---
Wow cool, they should totally make this into a thing!
---
that's because most of them are teensy weensy gnomes , hiding in the grass. they see you!
---
call of duty
---
Resto druids have a very clearly defined role in raids and at no point did people question whether they can fulfill that role. The fact they are not stacked in raids or are an unpopular choice for 5 mans doesnt change this at all. Dont derail the topic.
---
So if i start playing in like 2:30 is that ok?
---
theres no queue on other realms because they're all dead too. Your server is just deader
---
The trouble is I find if I start wanding at 40%, my shield
---
wears off, meaning that by the end of the fight I‚Äôve taken enough damage for me to have to heal myself, which annoyingly involves me having to come off shadowform, heal, and then reapply shadowform (which itself is a mana intensive process). 
---
It‚Äôs also a bit unfortunate to hear that shadow spec and wands only start to show dividends at around 50+. To be honest I only planned to level shadow from 40-52 to boost my levelling experience abit, I was always planning to spec holy/disc at around 52 anyway lol.
---
Should I just cut my losses and spec holy/disc now earlier than planned?
---
But what would you get out of +8 healing on 40 second fights? At least on DPS it can make that fight 0.1 second shorter, healers get literally nothing out of it if it doesn't allow you to bring one less healer.
---
Happy cake day!
---
Dang that's sweet.
---
My problem with TSM is that it changes the UI totally and its kind drinking from a waterfall (too much info) :D
---
So in that case use OCE? Why Australia?
---
Wish you still could portal a Gedon bomb
---
Can't heal stupid.
---
Hai\^\^  i know right xD they catching up so fast its just crazy , i remember i spend my first week of playing in searching for a shield trainer for my rogue lol  back then was crazy xD Hope you can find more time to play together. Me and my gf going are kinda in the same spot, we are actually in long distance relationship. We both working hard so one day we can live together and we use every minute when we have free to be together and now with wow is even better \^\^. Wishing you all best :)
---
We only tried sharing vendorstrike. Now we know why it's not called shardstrike.
---
A lot of people afk during the flight so you just have to wait a while after they land.
---
Indeed.
---
Up to 60, yes. At L60, fuck no. You cannot just AOE the endgame 5man instances (as you try to avoid pulling more than you need to), in fact its usually FASTER with more melee, since it might require less downtime drinking.
---
Some instances, like Strat UD last boss are horrible to heal with many melees, but other than that if theres 1 mage for water, the rest can be melees.
---
MH - heart seeker 
---
OH - alcor‚Äôs 
---
Felstriker looks great on paper but never procs in PvP setting
---
Druids can remove curses though, which are just as evil as magic sometimes and its not like every other healer can remove magic, its only priests (and paladins if you are alliance) that have that ability.
---
If you constantly have to res a party member, you got a problem and its not the res cooldown. Yes, it can happen, but those are rare exceptions (and a res in combat might prevent a complete wipe sometimes as well).
---
Every healer class has its quirks, as a shaman I absolutely hate not having a single hot or heal spell that can be cast on the run, besides 2 minute cooldown nature's swiftness. Groups that move around a lot are a nightmare with totems and short spot heals in between.
---
no
---
Well then you are lost.
---
Sorry, I don't speak jive.
---
Time for Hunters to brush up on peeling tactics again.
---
They dont.
---
Pretty shitty update considering they are advertising a vanilla experience.
---
This method is literally how to solo an area that is packed with mobs when no groups are around and takes skill to pull off in a lot of cases without getting additional aggro.
---
First "hot fix" I've seen that really got to me emotionally.
---
6% for trolls before talents without scope
---
Hai\^\^ i'm working as designer and actually i can play a lot  depends on my projects. Sometimes im farming gold or grinding exp on back when im working too lol so that helps a lot :) and im not wasting time , every minute i spend leveling my 3 characters was getting exp not exploring and stuff thats why i was super surprised when i got that feeling back \^\^
---
This sub isn‚Äôt a monolith.
---
And pvp? Cause I mainly pvp
---

---
That is so wrong. At least for a warrior spirit makes a huge difference to leveling speed as it will cut down the time you take to heal up between mobs. With a good amount of spirit you never need to bandage or eat, which also saves you money / effort to look for a friendly mage. Stacking end game stats of course isn't optimal for leveling.
---
Yep exactly, obviously some salty Bois downvoting me still though!
---
The thing that annoys me at 60 is how many healers there are (I am one), it seems groups are looking for tanks or DPS all the time whilst 5 healers spam chat :(
---
Yeah, but the Orcs stole the credit.
---
We saw the 20k queue and immediately decided to jump on the second server that opened. That one had a 3+ hour queue as well after a few minutes, so we decided to get on the third one, which still had 30-60 minutes queues at release, but that was tolerable.
---
This is completely false, I'm a warlock and can confirm infernal can be loose and be used to be troll noobs
---
BFD in Ashenvale
---
So Agony for short encounters and Shadow for long ones?

---
You're not the bad guy for reserving one item. This community just has too many precious snowflakes who think that every group ever conceived should include them, regardless of anything.
---
The only thing I maybe do differently to you, is I don't disclude any classes. I just state the reservation clearly at all times, and let people decide for themselves if the run is still good for them, which it often is. If you're worried about specific classes rolling need when they agreed not to, you can simple turn on master loot for that one boss, and roll off any items not reserved, then switch back to group loot.
---
Either way, all the buttfhurt over this issue is increadibly petty. Willing to bet many of the complaints are coming from those too lazy to ever make their own groups, hence why they want every door in the game open to them, regardless.
---
I'm prot and thread has never been an issue. People dying on the other hand has.
---
I don't watch him a lot but every time I enter his stream he seems to be congratulating himself on his growth as a streamer and his journey through WoW. Gets tiring after hearing the same self-congratulatory story 12 times.
---
Retail isn't really an RPG-MMO anymore sadly. It's more of a hub or lobby game. Vanilla/Classic is all about the interactions and immersion. They really are totally different games.
---
goddamit, this smells like retail carebear stuff. Whatever happened to warts and all auuthentic?
---
The comment above is false, I am a warlock and can confirm infernal can be used to troll needs
---
Yep. Whereas as warrior I had the same problem of having lots and lots of miss parry and dodges, but that usually meant I was already dead and didn't know it yet XD
---
And this was doing only green mobs and green quests.
---
Plz update us when you have news
---
From what I remember, shield sometimes breaks to damage in the last couple seconds, you take two hits from a mob which would eventually regenerate. You can also pop VE on some mobs to get a bit of healing, or eat/bandage.
---
Depends on how many dungeons you plan on doing. You still need to do some quest chains before 60 which are much easier as shadow, but totally doable as holy too as long as you grab spirit tap. Questing as 21/30/0 is really depressing.
---
Or aggro onto you despite the fact that you did nothing to warrant being on their threat table other than exist while someone ran by.

---
i have around 34 days combined on all of my characters but most of it is AFK and other stuff , im workign as designer and have a flexible time \^\^ and i can play on back when im working too :P
---
Does anyone know why we can't duel in IF anymore?
---
There is healer shortage for UBRS and tribute runs for sure and even for HoJ farm but that is because those places have 0-1 drops for healers.
---
I always teach new players and have always had a positive experiance when I said I didn't know the route, but thats as the tank.
---
I understand Warriors that reserve stuff to make gold, I would even pay you 20 gold/h if you run some dungeons where you dont need anything.
---
If you are on a PvP server there is just no server, anywhere, with more alliance than horde. Especially at 25 to 75 %.
---
A lock is a shadow mage in raids. 
---
You put up your assigned curse and hit shadowbolt. 
---
Options are sm/ruin (10% shadow damage with imp out for tank group) or DS/ruin (15% from sac) SM ruin is better with less gear cause your crit is too low to make destro work well, and easier to crossover pvp and farm with.

---
How is this roleplay? He's roleplaying as a scammer?
---
This is nice and simple, will definitely install it later. I much prefer addons that are exactly that - adding to the original layout, rather than revamping the UI.
---
Because the server is based out of Australia?  If this is such an important issue ask Blizzard...
---
Now you are home.
---
You can totally do that.  Blizzard won't do shit.
---
they're not but nice try
---
Feel stupid now for saying these servers are dead and you rather wait 5 hours in queue?
---
&gt;Resto druids have a very clearly defined role in raids....The fact they are not stacked in raids or are an unpopular choice for 5 mans doesnt change this at all
---
lol ok. 
---
&gt;The **fact** they are **not stacked in raids** or are an **unpopular choice for 5 mans** 
---
All I said was - people have a clear and defined reason for preferring other healers, and all you've done is try to pretend I've said a lot more, and that is just straw-manning. 
---
I'm not going to sit here while you make up arguments as if I said them and berate me for it. Someone said people claim "druids can't heal" - you said that isn't true. I said that is not their healing, but their sub optimal utility and "worse of the class" healing compared to others that gives people this impression. 
---
All you're doing now is screeching at me about how "druids have places in this game" as if I said anything else than "less optimal than the others so they are perceived as weak". 
---
holy shit are you trying to flash that giant chip on your shoulder or something?
---
Only we're true paladins, rets can suck dicks
---
The real MVP here.
---
As a warrior I died within 1.64s of being mind controlled mostly to blade flurry last sunday... ofc I‚Äòll cleave that ony buff off of those pesky rogues ü§≠
---
The chart disagrees.
---
Hai\^\^ i said that to a lot of comments here but ... im working as designer and i have a flexible time depends on my projects and also i can play on back when im working :p about my gf \^\^ i can always find time for her. we have few hours a day in which we leave everything we do and spend time together.
---
I use teamviewer to login from work before peak hour.
---
I have to click my char once every 15mins or so just to not get dc:ed but its worth it just to be able to play whenever I come home.
---
I really like the server and the community but the ques are somewhat tiresome.
---
nice
---
I didnt switch and now im on a server with 80/20 Faction balance and 3k queues on weekdays :P
---
But I'm self aware enough to realize that this is my own fault, not blizzards
---
My server still gets queue times.
---
Imagine playing the most popular and streamlined class and being upset when someone else asks you to use an ability. You want to be compensated? Bless your little heart.
---
Honestly mc is so ez, I'd just wait for the leaf.  Fuck that 3% xbow drop.
---
AQ will matter cause It's significantly harder than BWL and it will open AQ20 and AQ40 so 2 more lockouts. AQ also requires guild farming/consumables/RN =&gt; lots of time. 
---
Add to this that most guilds wil still clean BWL and ZG on a weekly basis and maybe even still Ony and MC and you can see how AQ opening will glue raiders to their computers.
---
Now I wonder if he got the idea from your conversation.
---
Id say the queues start around 16:00ish. Havent really been a issue, if im running late, i use teamviewer to login pre-q and stay online with it. Weekends the ques start early afternoon. So if you start any sooner, thats fine too.
---
Only a problem if you suddenly want to pop into the game at evening. Not going to happen.
---
nightfall isn‚Äôt a dps gain it‚Äôs a PvP ability. You still have global then stand there doin nothing.
---
I'm not going on that medium pop server, it'll be dead in a month, I'll rather wait in queue for 5 hours on the high pop ones
---
And i opened dozens of lockboxes from mages as a rogue without getting any tip xD
---
Do you play WoW just to be an asshole to everyone? Because it seems like you can only have fun when ruining someone else's.
---
Darnassus design suck plain ass. Water everywhere, can't straight line from point A to point B, everything's far and difficult to access with ramps all the way around to get into the AH for example, etc.
---
It's just sad because I do like elf's lore, but the layout of the city is just too inconvenient to even setup bank alts
---
SW in that regard is not much better, Ironforge rules when it comes to efficient design, but you got to be in SW if you want that sweet onyxia buff, and also see some sky
---
some mobs have much higher drop rate for greens, though. for example humanoids will usually drop much more greens than beasts.
---
Still makes him a scammer.
---
Just some basics, like not allowing dps warrs to roll on tanking t1. Not allowing healers to roll on pure dps items where there is viable alternative for healers (like not allow healers to roll on Mageblade, they got Aurastone hammer). Not allowing hybrid dps to roll on healing t1. Etc.   
---
I believe all those examples are pretty much expected and logical.
---
Jump runs are good if you have a healer and a dps to come with you.
---
Another option is farming SM:Cathedral solo.
---
Bats in EPL work decently.
---
It‚Äôs a fairly common drop in the village outside Deadmines.
---
Yh his stream itself is pretty uninteresting, but he's pretty chill in other people's streams when he's not streaming.
---
Vanilla was *nothing* like how crowded the big Classic servers are.  Don‚Äôt be ridiculous.  The outside world of Azeroth was not designed to handle this many players at the same time, and it was already apparent *with* layering.  Instance farming was always a thing, but it wasn‚Äôt the only way to farm, but it definitely will be in Classic.
---
By your logic, no one should play arms or fury since it's an offspec right? 
---
It just sounds very elitist unless you're super sweaty and only play the top tier classes. Shadow in 5 mans is fine, considering I do nearly everything a holy priest does, and Shadow is top tier in PVP.
---
Dragonmaw orcs in Wetlands. Perfect level for you, very tightly packed with fast respawn, and they're humanoids so plenty of greens and clothes.
---
Uh this enchant comes from a quest, and has nothing to do with the enchanting profession. And you don't "disenchant" wrong enchants, you simply enchant over it again. Which is what the OP would need to do, but he's already wasted 100g on the wrong one.
---
Op is voidwalker about to get sac'd
---
do you even have a point?
---
As a new player this mentality is beyond me.
---
If someone needs it -&gt; Roll need.
---
What 'needing' means to me? Its that he intends to use it. That its an important item, an upgrade to his existing equipment.
---
Every other case: Greed. (or pass) Because that's what the button means. You want it out of greed. Your character doesn't need the item, you need the money. Greed. Simple.
---
And about 'twinking', and getting items for it: F_ck that. If you want an item for your twink, then either earn it on said twink, or buy it with the money from your main. Don't rob people who are working on progressing the character they are currently playing. If you "need" on items other people literally need, because you want it for your twink, then you are an asshole and I wish you all the best in life because buddy you'll need it soon.
---
Oh god, I feel bad for anyone doing Tirion's questline now. 
---
The part with the grave robbers was legit impossible as a non-mage without reseting the pack like that
---
Direct quote:
---
&gt;It doesn‚Äôt just feel dead, it is dead.
---
"IT IS DEAD"... do you see that?
---
Comment for later!
---
It's only worth it for leveling, camping devilsaurs isn't worth it. If you're going to do Dire Maul you need to have engineering. In addition to that I'd recommend enchanting, herbalism or mining. Mining is probably the weakest.
---
I would probably use both the LBRS and DM ring for stacking mp5, but shamans will use different sets depending on the fight. I have both a +healing for short fights and +mp5 for longer fights (Like Rag or Garr for our guild)
---
Thanks for the effort, sad to see people would rather insult your work than ignore and move on if they don't need or like it. I will be using it!
---
True, compared to vanilla, theres a TON more healers this time around. Back then you got whispers to join a instance run, now if you whisper a guy looking to do certain instances 10s after the message, you were already too late. *sigh*
---
You know these are all "cheap knockoff reposts" of R&amp;M, right?
---
Literally me at the end of every night
---
A good anything has a pretty good shot against some idiots.
---
In my opinion it goes completely against the spirit of not just this game, but basically any multiplayer game. With 5/10 characters you can go solo lots of content you shouldn‚Äôt be able to as an individual. You can farm more things, faster than you should be able to as an individual. It‚Äôs an unfair advantage that simply should not be allowed. 
---
To me, it‚Äôs straight up cheating. If this were a single player game... more power to you. Do whatever you want in a single player game. But in a multiplayer game? Definitely not. What other players do in this game affects everyone else. With that said, multiboxers are so infrequent that those affects are probably so minimal that I‚Äôm not going to lose an ounce of sleep over it. It‚Äôs whatever, I don‚Äôt *really* care at the end of the day, but when asked I‚Äôll be honest that I do think it‚Äôs cheating and wish it were banned. 
---
 I personally don‚Äôt really understand how anyone sees it as *not* cheating. I‚Äôve never heard a convincing argument from anyone who disagrees... most just bring up the fact that it‚Äôs not common enough to be a real concern, and they‚Äôre not wrong... but that‚Äôs beside the point. And I really do think that if it were not for the extra subscriptions blizzard gets out of allowing it, they would see it exactly as I do.

Just here to read comments.

Can you even read?

ShowMeMyHeal lets you set the position.
---
/cackle is the only real laugh an undead can produce
---
Huh, I've never noticed that on Westfall ally tbh. It's always tanks even for UBRS and tribute runs.
---
Show me some official source for that, please.
---
Shoutout to Project Mayhem, what a badass guild name
---
That's a big If.  
---
There is an in built system for playing with people you can trust: it's called a Guild.  
---
For those of us pugging, the reality is different.
---
RR?
---
That's if you have a bow. It's also 6% for dwarfs with a gun (lol only one gun at 60 that's even decent)
---
With such short fights, crit RNG can make all the difference for warlocks.
---
Resistance is futile
---
I was actually disappointed that I couldn‚Äôt see my heals, I‚Äôll have to download this one later.
---
Selling at AH is still usage.
---
The server capacity is the same regardless of how many layers there are.. layers are designed to make leveling zones less congested during launch
---
Yo, is this Noggenfogger - Cryptore??
---
Hmm, Maybe paladins have some okay drops there? At least rend runs have band of rumination that might be good for them.
---
&gt; One layer has a LIMIT how many people it can hold without lagging.
---
sure but that's the same limit has having no layers, i/o requirement is the same.
---
Like I said before layers just separate players to not overcrowd areas for the benefit of the players not the hardware.
---
Don't think so hopefully one comes today.
---
Yeah, one orb to the tank makes up for the time they could have spent farming solo.  There's nothing really in Live Strat for a tank so that orb is the only incentive for them to run because otherwise they could have just spent an hour farming.  Reserving all orbs is just a couple of people trying to dupe the rest of the group into making them rich for running a 5-man dungeon.
---
Which server
---
Meh, I disagree, I was in a group where Axe of Deep Woods dropped and we all agreed we were happy for the Warrior to take it (since he was fury and almost full BIS) as long as he equipped it, which he did.
---
lol I once dueled a pala for 15-30 minutes in vanilla. We just eventually called it quits, it went on forever.
---
Dead game.
---
Technically that would be deathbringer, but it is not worth taking it over orc fury warriors.
---
Annihilator is probably the best alternative.
---
Don't rule out Perdition Blade either, if you don't have any rogues that want daggers, consider taking this.
---
Also SPs aren't as bad as people think they are. Spellpower coefficients were partly wrong on private servers. Actually SPs do alot better in classic than they did on pservers.
---
In the same way as others who are going to sell it to buy their own class BOE later.
---
Y I K E S
---
Space before the slash works
---
Meanwhile my realm is completely dead.
---
if you're actively raiding you shouldn't use either and if you're not those bracers aren't an option to begin with
---
Don‚Äôt pretend horde are any better.
---
There's pretty much no point in going holy until you are 30 and can get Divine Favor. Just put on some +int gear and downrank your heals when needed and you will be fine healing with any spec until like ZF.
---
You realize that taunt doesn't actually "generate" threat, right? It puts you at the top of the threat table, sure, but that might mean getting 0 or barely any threat out of it
---
It's probably not a bad thing for most people.  It's when the group is reserving all orbs because then it becomes 50-100g a run for the people reserving them, and they are basically milking the rest of the group into farming gold for them...or at least trying to.
---
What is that disgusting nameplate addon omg?
---
Our priest got controlled. Me as a rogue and a enhance shammy attacked him once each. Wf procced for both of us. There was no priest left standing.
---
if you take a look at the prot tree, it actually doesn't offer much mitigation at all
---
5% Blockchance leading to Imp. shieldblock, tho only the first point in improved shield block does anything
---
10 Def skill which is quite bad
---
Last Stand
---
15% more threat in Def. Stance
---
Shield Wall duration from 10s to 16s on a 30min CD
---
putting 17 points into def gets you all the needed talents [Spec](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/--502301105)
---
any other talents are there to increase threat or give bonuses that aren't useful for bossfights
---
also 2s CD reduction on taunt
---
this leaves a lot of points to be put into other spec, you could put up to 34 points into Fury and still tank with a shield, bloodthirst doesn't actually profit off the offhand, just your attackpower.
---
The offhand gives some extra damage and extra rage but isn't always needed
---
it let's you chose between having a shield and being tanky or maximum threat
---
the advantage of full prot is, that you can go into arms to be able to stance-dance and get some more parry
---
As long as you have a good guild willing to take you on runs to build your pre-raid BIS, sure. Still, later on warriors will speed up ahead.
---
It doesn't apply to pets does it?
---
The unwritten rule for hunters seems to be "You can hit FD button only after waiting for aggroed mob to run all the way into your face, taking at least 1 hit and backpeddling for a bit".
---
SP were never weak to begin with, they just struggle with mana real hard on longer fights. If the fight ain't that long, they can really shine.
---
Imo, if it's boe everyone should just roll need.  Instead of wanting some honor system where we all greed.
---
Problems solved. Ninjas powerless
---
I have not used my walker since i got the succubus, hell if i had to level again right now id probably not even do the quest. Hes AT BEST a pvp pet
---
Agreed af !  
---
Upgrade ? Roll need !  
---
15 years ago, I remember we didn't paid that much attention to the BoE items.
---
That has to be your server man, hacent experienced that since SM
---
I'm level 45 as well, though I'm just back from holiday for 12 days there, though I'm the same if I hit 60 by Xmas I would be happy.
---
Undead rogues are KoS.
---
Use Succu, she does more damage than the dog and does so without using lash so you can use her full mana as a battery
---
Under 24 seconds - nothing. 
---
24-30 seconds agony 
---
1 min plus shadow
---
Ninja looting can be banable though. The part people dont get is that Blizzard only consider loot disputes an offense if there has been agreed upon loot rules communicated within the game that have been clearly violated.
---
I guess in the end there is very little content in Classic to post.
---
Tbh the regrowth spec seems to be competitive atm, our main druid is topping meters with it, but it might be because ony/MC is such a roflstomp that the fights take so little time and there is nearly no going oom :D.
---
There's always several people farming water in felwood even at 6 am, and that's with 2 layers.
---
If your dps aren't doing that much damage, ofc threat wont be an issue. When warlocks with flask and world buffs (and minmaxed gear ofc) start critting with shadowbolts, or your fury warriors start molesting their heroic strike button, you'll need to do more threat than what deep prot can put out. It does require a good amount of threat gear to work, though
---
Thats true. I regret rolling on pve so i really want bgs and im sure there is plenty of us.
---
Tier 2 is the only reason to roll a Paladin imo.  Great looking set and great for PvP!
---
as i mentioned in another post: dont tell me what i have witnessed.
---
why would anyone make such a post out of imagination??
---
it is exactly like that on transcendence, atleast if you dont have much contacts/guild.
---
as i said, it might me be just me having a bad reputation for playing bad. but then again, i didnt have much chance to build up that kind of rep, wondering where it would come from.
---

Hoof ! You tried to milk the puns
---
This is what everyone wanted right? No layers and packed cities?
---
Low key kinda cute !
---
nipsout
---
You wont get to roll due to master loot
---
Do you have some reading comprehension problems? Yes it is fucking fine, I never said it sucks for 5 mans. However it is clearly not great. Great is mage that brings better single target dps, really good aoe, and has less mana problems. 
---
I am done talking to you. You are attacking arguments that I never made. You claim that I call shadowpriests garbage and you also claim that I implied its impossible to find groups as one. I said neither but still somehow you managed to fabricate these false accusations to target in your messages.
---

Isn't this Roleplaying?

Talk about context ads.

Thats why you go instance farm
---
my guy was a rogue too
---
What an absolute idiot, how can you be so stupid? :D
---
I understand your point, but I want to focus on the comment at hand. people aren't saying druids "cant heal" because they lack the ability to actually heal - they say they can't heal because they can't dispell group wiping CCs like fear and stun, they can't rez the odd party member who dies, and compared to literally every other healer, are the worst at throughput/efficiency to the point that they get an ability to regenerate mana, and its STILL better to give it to another healer during raids. 
---
Being the buff-bitch class doesn't inspire confidence in others, so this is how people can foster such a reputation. 
---
Its important to remember that, in the end, druids were given OOC rez and dispel magic because those were considered core mechanics to all healers eventually (in an effort to remove take the class not the player mentality when class balance was having issues). They maintain that ability to this day in retail.
---
Yep.  My character is full pre-raid and pre-raid pvp bis with professions that are nearly complete and allow me to passively make a lot of gold.  I worked really hard to get to the point I'm at, but I'm finding that the most valuable things I got from all of that effort was the positive interactions I had along the way.  
---
Some people know who I am now and choose to play with me when the opportunity arises.  Some people refer their friends to me when they want something crafted.  Some people ask me if I'll form a pug sometime soon so they can join my raid.  This is what classic is all about and good impressions are both long lasting and meaningful in a world where you'll regularly run into the same people.
---
wait what

Yes, because referring to Blizzard and getting banned is roleplaying.
---
Whoa there cowboy, chill. My point is expect quite high prices for it once it pops up, expect it to be gone fast, don't let it sit in your recipe book but actually use it once you get it.
---
You'd be surprised what people do on the internet, constantly see posts deleted claiming outrageous clearly untrue things lol.
---
I can't see one server being totally different to so many (basically all) other servers though, even if it has been your experience I'm sure it will change very quickly as you must have been unlucky.
---
Yuka Screwspigot isn't a prereq, it's a bread crumb. Once you accept Ribbly the bread crumb disappears.

---
Good luck
---
What guild are you in because I‚Äôm in one of those 4 guilds lol.
---
As a healer, I am honestly quite bored during raids, so I actually love warlocks because at least they give us something to do. 
---
Don't really mind healing warlocks up in dungeons too, I just need them to not go down to 10% health when I drink and just stand there instead of eating at the same time. Otherwise, I love me some hellfire bois in the group, keeps me busy!
---
I think it's just due to the sheer amount of druids/priests/pld we have on Westfall. And how fucked our tank population is for pugs
---
Alliance have more armour and the mana efficiency of FoL is high but I do not see the threat issues with a good tank with the current gear unless the DPS are doing something stupid like pop CD at the start or are getting a lucky crit streak at the start. Either way that is bad DPS.
---
I regret not leveling my warrior alt quicker
---
How dare they wait for friends !
---
You think you do........
---
One time use, ever. Doesn't really count.
---
Bro you literally took the exact same words. It was just so bizarre I had to ask.
---
Using zperl but for raid frames using shadowed. Does shadowed have the same functionality on play and target frames (cast bar, buffs, debuffs etc?). Might switch to all shadowed.
---
Ironforge .. ow man does that bring memories :P
---
Horde has way better flightpaths and small towns around the world.
---
In a guild run when no one needs it it doesn't matter anyways, as the one person winning the greed roll will sell it and obviously divide the profit so everyone gets an equal share. Or if someone needs the item, he rolls need and gets to play with his new toy.
---
The question is, how do you do it outside of guilds, and some people apparently think, morals towards strangers should be limited to a few gold or something.
---
moltern core
---
I said it was a huge part of the game TO ME and it is. Believe it or not, we don't get to choose what leaves impressions on us. I'm not a sociopath choosing my opinions to please a mass. I just really associate the rampaging infernal with classic.
---
So yeah you're right we do have a different idea of what huge is, and you acknowledging that  makes your comment pointless imo

I was going for more of a [Unchained Melody](https://youtu.be/HvyCMgAajqk?t=74) vibe and less of a "I just impaled this human with a fishing pole" vibe.
---
You get this enchant from turning in a Libram (valued at 50g+ on most servers), 30g in pure gold and some mats from un'goro and felwood, and for the reward you pick between +8 to any stat for the head/leg slots. He probably meant to pick int or spirit but picked agility instead.
---
Queue times, while annoying, are also a good indication of sustained popularity of our favorite game
---
Teldrassil because of the scale.
---
Has 3 x 60's and a GF - teach me senpai!
---
What are the queue times like?
---
Runs where you take greens, jump runs with mining (not sure why they are ring though?) And taking first orb.
---
It's fine, what isn't fine is taking the only reason most people are there, all the orbs, it's sheer greed and people just don't go so I don't get why people do it lol
---
Soliton or Bjo?
---
AoE farming = int gear. 
---
Single target + pvp = spell power gear.

Wow calm down with the r word.
---
Westfall. Although I mainly play Horde, Westfall was a big part of my Vanilla experience.
---
Possibly lower than pserver tables, but I grinded a lot of cats for decent profit while leveling
---
thanks. hopefully they add it. i can understand the reputation argument but being stuck with a name you dislike is kind of strange
---
You are 100% incorrect here my man
---
That server is packed with private server veterans.
---
Imagine gatekeeping a class in the game you play
---
What are BoPed mages?
---
Still a misplay, but not for the reason you stated. I'm pretty sure you can apply arcanums to other peoples gear in the "Do not trade" window, so he could've just sold the finished enchant for 100g.
---
it's amazing
---
i do have the same problem? Did you find any solution u could share? Thanks.
---
Did you just call one of the only obtainable loot in the game right now that will last you until next expansion min-max?
---
Maybe people should have used their brain in the first place and put more thought into their name pre-launch.
---

Seriously though. Everyone's always talking about Mages having the best travel capability. And I think that's true for those rare moments you have to cross the continent.
---
But if you're questing in a zone, Astral Recall is the real deal.
---
You mean the comments that accidently have been submitted twice? They are still there. Just not duplicated.      
---
Could it be you are just looking for the cheapest way possible to get out because you dont have a point at all? No, that cant be.
---
&gt; With 5/10 characters you can go solo lots of content you shouldn‚Äôt be able to as an individual. You can farm more things, faster than you should be able to as an individual. It‚Äôs an unfair advantage that simply should not be allowed. 
---
Ah....yeah okay, I'm clearly short-sighted :p
---
Now that you mention it, actually that's entirely correct. There ARE tons of people farming instances like mad, and they HAVE to, because say for instance you group up as a warrior with a rogue and warrior and HoJ drops. One of them gets it, and then the next party will be with fresh faces who ALSO want it and ultimately you could end up running it many times, and it IS an unfair advantage if you're multiboxing and not having to share the roll with who know how many people over who knows how many runs.
---
I actually hadn't considered this aspect, thank you.
---
Not all of them go through trade chat/ah, eventually another guild will get their hands on it.
---
When you‚Äôre sending mail there‚Äôs a box at the bottom to send gold as well and a little button next to it that says cod. If you click that then instead of sending the gold to the person they have to send it to you to get whatever items are in the mail.
---
i am human
---
I am not missing it; I am disagreeing. 
---
Luckily there are a whole lot of Rogues who don't seem too bothered with leveling up lockboxes and even opening them *for free*, \*gasp\*. I have a feeling our opinions just differ on this subject.
---
6% hit is enough as human with ironfoe, the +5 wep skill counts as 3% hit
---
&gt;only obtainable loot in the game right now that will last you until next expansion min-max?

I think you just did for me, thanks.

---
I didnt buy the recipe, if thats what youre asking.
---
The only thing available in original vanilla were server transfers so hopefully they are just going to stick to that.
---
Oh look, an unpopular opinion that's popular.
---
I have to be honest I've not seen this attitude in the wild, but I'd say probably 3/4 of my 70 or so dungeon runs have been with friends.
---
I think this is a minority mentality, and you should just not deal with these people again if you have the choice.
---
sometimes yes we use ony head etc. i just want to sort out my gear unbuffed. what should i replace?
---
I 100% am not on EU realms at least.
---
You know you could've applied the arcanum to someone elses great through the Not to be traded window? You could've probably recovered most of the cost by just selling the enchant to some rogue.
---
of course its his choice but he came here to ask our opinion did he not? so i gave mine, you don't have to agree with me, that's how opinions work everyone has a different view on things. If you want to run the same instance 1,000 times to get an item that's up to you, but its not something I would do personally. 
---
If I'm given the choice between running an instance a 30th time for a chance to get an item I'd actually rather go and play an alt, maybe level them up 5 times, unlock a bunch of spells for them and feel a much greater sense of progression.
---
My main is 29. I'm so far behind but I get about 3-4 hours a week. Thankfully rested xp helps.
---
While Leveling int&gt;spellpower 
---
Just because there is not much spellpower to get while leveling and you might not take a new item because it lacks spellpower.
---
But in reality it doesn't matter, during leveling
---

I had the same problem, I don‚Äôt have a lifestyle that allows me to sit down without interruption for hours on end,

Typically if you have several druid healers you just assign one exclusively to tank healing to avoid the HoT problems.
---
That's a shame, sorry it hasn't worked out with the rogue. Unless you've already set your heart on rerolling, may I suggest a couple of things? 
---
First, a guild would definitely benefit you gear-wise. So if someone else gets the item you need, it's in the guild, it will benefit your raid if not you personally. Also, you can ask people to help you for specific prebis, like 3-man farm General Angerforge for the HoJ if you still need one. Guilds make wow a lot better if you don't (or can't) solo all the time, it's way more reliable than PUGs can ever be. 
---
Second, are you at all inclined to raid? Hunters are awesome for levelling up, but they don't shine in raids as much as Rogues can, whose dps is one of the highest at this phase. 
---
Also, have you tried changing up your spec, to see if maybe you're stuck in one that doesn't work for you? 
---
And last, rogues have some pretty sweet solo farm spots end game - BRD pickpocket, LBRS archmage pattern farm, DM Tribute runs. 
---
Now, I'm not trying to dissuade you from making an alt, but I think that maybe you shouldn't completely abandon the Rogue yet!:)
---
I know... But I can't shittalk against my own faction now can I?
---
1st
---
There is the possibility of rerolling as well, but you probably already thought of that. I'm certain you would be able to hit 60 with a name of your liking before a name change function comes into question, if it ever does.
---
I thought tauren were restricted to wolves and kodo?
---
Just join a non-boomer guild, sub 90 MC is really bad if you are not pugging, especially with all the classic nerfs.
---
It's called friendly banter and you'd know this if you actually had any friends
---
If I am in a PUG run, I won't be offended by other people needing on my class expensive BOE.
---
They should be making 39s and 49s, that's where it's at.
---
More balanced, more fun, more abilities.
---
I leveled a leather worker through vanilla and TBC and didn‚Äôt know you could do this. Uhh how do you skin without looting?
---
people can always reroll. I know it's not easy, but people should have thought of the name beforehand and shouldn't expect for the world to change in order to redeem their personal mistakes.
---
Automaticly scan and automaticly bid on stuff... 
---
hmmmmmmmmm.
---
Good point !
---
Darn.
---
Takes me an hour for 100 rep right now. At 700 for neutral.
---
Hate to say it, but I think the health of the game / server takes priority over someone who didn't take the time to think of an appropriate name. I suppose again, it comes down to accountability.
---
link? first time I'm hearing of this.
---
You're misinformed. You dont need anywhere near min max to kill bosses in any raid in classic. If you look at some truly min-maxed raids in private servers, their raids are killing bosses waaaay under the enrage timer. I'm not talking 1 minute under, i'm talking in like a quarter of the enrage timer. Vael's enrage timer is 3 mins, guilds have done it in under 30 secs.
---
The dps requirements are very lax, nowhere near the exapansions that came after. People were just bad back then.
---
&gt;Could it be you are just looking for the cheapest way possible to get out because you dont have a point at all?
---
Its kinda pitiful now. My comment is right there and you've never spoken to it. Not going to devolve into a screaming match, swapping insults, or rehashing what I wrote. 
---
You're fine to keep going though.
---
Bidding isn't automatic. You need to do it manually.
---
I lost a roll in WC (so not overly important) by getting a tie and being the second one to roll, because I was the tank and waited for the pull to be done before greeding.
---
Try that with a 60 ppl community that wants to play together, also character transfers were not a thing. So everyone would have hat to start again and again.
---
I really think they could have done better by releasing 3 at start of the name reservation instead of one.
---
The problem is, they reduce the layers now on all servers to finally release phase 2, when for Lucifron this will be a catastrophy, resulting in maybe 5k+ queues... On most other servers it seems mostly fine, but the top populated servers are clearly not ready for phase 2, but will be pushed anyway.
---
And also, could you name me even one German PvP server not layered and not labeled full on sundays? Why even bother to change servers when the new one also is full? We don't really have plenty options.
---
Taking healing gear that's not usable by the healer (leather when he's priest etc) or stuff he doesn't need.
---
Anything else yes you are a total PoS. How would you feel if someone took your tank gear if they weren't a tank.
---
Will always be Dun'Morogh
---
This can't be real right? Source?
---
I did. Please point out where he was proven guilty of account sharing or RMT. A bot automatically throwing out a ban as a result of logging in from a different ip isn‚Äôt proof that he was account sharing.
---
Why does the fury warrior use tier 1?
---
Ironforge Auction house! Love browsing for bargains and listing my loot after a long day of farming!
---
I‚Äôd like to know this too
---
This post has been brought to you by The Collective Broken Records of Reddit.
---
Please someone post a picture tomorrow on Reddit, of a fairly crowded Ironforge to really show those naysayers! Haha!
---
In pvp you use all of your curses, Slow/Agony vs Melee, Curse of Tongues vs Casters. Or you use Curse if shadow/elem if you are going to Succu into SB or Soul Fire.  
---
there is not really a 1 answer.
---
I don't understand something.
---
if even top populated servers had at most 3 layers and majority of them now have only 2 layers...how is it that you don't see at least half of those people?
---
aren't layers made to divide people into even numbers so that everybody has a chance to quest and kill mobs?
---
my server still is layered, and blizzard said themselves that there are only 2 layers on my server....but I don't have even 1/5th of that amount of people in orgrimmar. shouldn't I see be seeing half of the population...while the other half is on another layer?
---
To be quite honest, you don't really need tanks until probably Mara/ST. They are nice to have, but 4 DPS and a healer, with sensible pulling and perhaps the occasional off-healing, you should be fine.
---
People are much better at the game than they were in 2005, they use their spells far more effectively now... for the most part.
---
Well i think most items a druids tank wants rouges and maybe warriors would also need on
---
Elwyn Forest, of course, the beginning of the best gaming experience ever.
---
Not sure what class to be rolling. Want to do world pvp (bgs when they are releases) and mostly a solo player due to not having enough time to commit long hours at a time.
---
Looking for something that can hold its own when solo leveling and can also annoy the other factions if it's a 2v1. 
---
Horde or alliance doesn't bother me.
---
I know will be going engineering for on profession
---
I have been tanking most dungeons, and only take healing gear if the healer don't need them.  Between that and questing, I've got a good enough healing set to heal when I have to.  I'm still leveling, might be different if you're already 60.

If you try to login to lucifron at 7 youll be greeted by a 3k queue on weekdays :P

I'd say the greedy thing is needing an item in front of seoeone who needs it for use
---
A guildie has boosted several rogues to 2x rings. I offered him the standard fee on my server (40g each) but he just wanted to help.. so I traded him 10g for each ring, and then mailed him like 40 stacks of Thorium Shells after.
---
Ironforge! It‚Äôs my home base!

Until 60

because loatheb is the first real fight where seal of light is actually usefull, on every other fight either seal is not an optimal use of one of the 16 debuff slots. There can be argument for using seal of wisdom on the weakened phase in the Cthun p2 fight for your healers to regen mana but only if your raid cannot kill cthun within one weakened phase. 
---
Up to that point, there are more important debuffs your raid should be using.
---
The optimal use of the 16 debuff slots until AQ is:
---
Sunder Armor, Curse of Recklessness / Elements / Shadow, Annihilator, Faerie fire, winters chill, improved shadowbolt, gift of arthas, the two Thunderfury debuffs (replaced by Corruption until your raid has TF), Nightfall (replaced by Corruption if the boss requires 3 tanks), T2 hunter set bonus debuff, improved hunters mark, shadow weaving. This leaves 1 debuff slot available for Taunt or Demo shout on untauntable bosses.
---
As you can see, all of these debuffs serve as a dps increase which makes the boss die faster, and thus requires less healing / mana. Both seals are therefore a loss of raid dps, and thus considered useless in a raid scenario.
---
For AQ the winters chill debuff should get replaced by Fire vulnerability, and the T2 hunter set debuff by Ignite.
---
I simply asked you what your point is. You keep dodging that question and go on off topic rants.
---
43. I guess I will be done by End of November. A level every two days should be possible.
---
And not a SINGLE paladin!
---
But you get the leather FROM skinning?
---
Right now for raids black dragonscale pants are bis. Once bwl is out cloudkeeper becomes bis
---
&gt;  My comment is right there and you've never spoken to it. Not going to devolve into a screaming match, swapping insults, or rehashing what I wrote.
---
No problem glad to help
---
Did same on release, was worth it
---
I am already 60, and in some fights in mc you are far better off being a healer or decurser than just another rogue.  Tha said, your healing is a lot weaker too, so every bit of gear helps.
---
How long was it for doing the first quest? My bad luck with drop rate it takes around 1 hr-1 hr 20 minutes to get 2 turn ins. I would end up with around 30-40 rugged leather, 10-15 chimera leather, 3-5 Warbear leather by that time.
---
Blackrock Mountain. For the PvP battles and design in general
---
Possibly some overlap yeah but the point is more "how you feel doing the job and someone else taking it that they don't need with what they are doing".
---
Can't complain if it's just honest overlap, if the rogue is rolling on defense gear though that's just ninjaing, that's the logic.
---
It's not completely arsehole behaviour if he is staying he is doing it before the run but it's still pretty shitty since with the lack of tanks the healer might not have a choice, I certainly wouldn't be adding a tank doing this for future runs anyway, not sure I'd blacklist him though, so it's a grey area.
---
It's more about a raid viable tanking spec that can also hold its ground in solo content. But what do I know, all warriors I play with are either deep prot, dps fury or pvp arms and don't bother to respec.
---
Your "unpopular opinion" is the way the world works.
---
Come to ten storms get your ass whooping
---

---
Bloodfang is the most populated of the english pvp servers. I never regretted moving here
---
Amazing
---
You might find it harder to find a healer this way, but assuming you can it‚Äôs entirely your prerogative because it‚Äôs your group. Do consider only reserving some pieces in each run, rather than all the Healing Gear, so you don‚Äôt scare away too many healers. Problem you‚Äôll find is finding a healer who has any reason to run the dungeon with all their desired gear reserved.  
---
You could flex your giant Tank dick and whisper group leaders looking for tanks if they‚Äôd take you on the condition X healer item is reserved for you
---
OG looks on our server even with layering like this.. cant imagine when they remove it \^\^...
---
How to Perdition's Blade.
---
Azshara.
---
Growl doesn't have a debuff?
---
Yea the provision quests are bullshit. Second quest is kill X mobs and is way faster to do, plus can be grouped for.
---
If the mob is loose (proximity pulled with no agro table yet) or not CC'd, any amount of threat is going to pull it on to that player.
---
As I said, in endgame dungeons, all the tools to make Hellfire the more desirable option should be available and used. In an UBRS, as was the original example, if a Warlock is forced to use only Rain of Fire, there is something wrong with the group.
---
Optimal AoE DPS does not need to have any extra risk involved if executed and supported properly. If that were not the case you would see groups single-targeting everything for "maximum safety." Your group can clear both safely and quickly. Hellfire is not inherently dangerous if the group is performing correctly.
---
You just picked a class that is really popular whilst bringing nothing to the table that other classes don't do better. Should have seen this coming. Cry me a river
---
Im 100% sure it worked like this even in tbc, i mean infernals going mental on everyone
---
Dude, fuck Eric.
---
But is the healer truly better off waiting for another tank than going with me?
---
You don't add those things because they're hard as balls to calculate - but I'd argue you should if the numbers were easy to work out. Use better data to make better decisions.
---
Yeah I understand that bit about pvp but I'm talking specifically from a damage burst stand point.
---
Btw how is Curse if Elements related to Succ?
---
Fiery is better, having a crusader proq on your final hit is a waste of the buff while fieryweapons proqs are almost never wasted. Its also better to use it on a one handed instead of a 2handed.
---
Easy way to kill him is to avoid fears altogether by kiting him around AQ entrance. Don‚Äôt even need a Warlock.
---
Seems to be very rare, I got one after 10mins of farming the fields in wpl but now after another 4 hours I got nothing
---
And btw I rarely have any group that doesn't have at LEAST 1 meele in it for my dungeon runs
---
*hey- how ya doing lil momma let me whisper in ya ear, tell ya something that ya might like to hear*
---
Yea i feel you on this (perks of  being a warrior tank no one wants your gear) and like you said if he says thst be will be needing on healing gear its fine but maybe let the healer get the things he needs and take what he cant/wont use
---
When you stare into the avatar...
---
Until Vael.
---
I wouldn't go with you on principle, if I am after one specific drop and you take it, that is a shit feeling. As I said, empathy, how would you feel if someone took offspec loot over your main?
---
I'm on EU realms, every player plays this way. You are in the minority here man, sorry.
---
8 Int is much better than 9 Arcane Spell Damage. Arcane Wrath items are almost totally worthless in classic. I don't know how new you are, but in case you haven't realized it yet, frostbolt should generally be your main damaging ability even as an arcane mage (arcane mages are in general very good in classic, but they use frostbolt and want frost spell damage or general spell damage items; this is a little counterintuitive). Arcane Missiles is a generally weak ability with some very good niche uses which are kind of advanced.
---
Been playing since the start and still haven't decided on anything yet. Have a 30 Rogue, 27 Mage &amp; Lock and 20-24 Hunter, Druid, Priest, Warrior, and Shaman. Basically I've tried everything, but every time I watch some stream or video or hear a stupid comment like: "You'll never find a raid with that class", I change my mind and it's getting kinda frustrating to the point that I don't wanna play this game, and I played vanilla and Nostalrius and was looking forward soo much to Classic. So desperate, I've decided to post here after lurking the thread every Wednesday. Advice appreciated ty.
---
And then you are just too lazy to put grps together. Stop your weak ass excuses and just type in what u wanna do and what you need. It's so simple but you rather write a long ass reddit post crying about how noone is willing to take you
---
Well... I was told to not sell my class so i wrote the worst points i could come up with. Warlock is still so much fun imo and i absolutely love playing it and i'm really glad i didn't roll a mage
---
No, that's a "MO"- the first M ist massive. Any game that is online and multiplayer that only has 2 players playing with or against each other is certainly not an MMO. There's no hard definition when the massive comes in though to my knowledge.
---
Dunno but I need to look it up now.
---
It's not automatic bid. The scan is automatic. That's all. You have to manually bid.
---
Green items?  Dungeons.
---
Skillet Classic
---
Yeah exactly, that's the way most druids build their offsets, they take what the roles don't need.
---
Being greedy rolling against the stuff they need is pretty shitty that's kinda my point I'm trying to get across.
---
You can just pull the mobs that are in the way away and feign once the buyer has gone past.
---
Is it 18 slot or why do ppl want to farm it so bad
---
What were people doing with Solenar?  I can see kiting him to avoid his bugs, but wouldn‚Äôt his fear fuck over your kite anyway?  Am I an idiot for doing it the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù way?
---
People roll need on big ticket BOE items because other people aren‚Äôt trustworthy. Maybe 1 person in the group actually will equip it but they also might put it up on the AH or another party member might just roll need to sell it and the rest of you get fucked. The best way to handle it if you‚Äôre in a group with randoms is for everyone to roll need. If you win and want to give it to the person who said they‚Äôd use it then do so. The difference between high vs low lvl boes is ofc the value. No one should really give shit about a 5-10g blue but a 200g+ epic is a lot of gold farmin.
---
I thought about posting it here, but was scared it will get downvoted to shit. reddit ruined me
---
it makes soul fire do more damage + conflag + searing pain
---
Hmmm okay. If you don't mind me asking, what server are you on? What does the faction balance of the server look like?
---
I think I was aiming to attempt at endgame as a healer this time around, having played as rogue for retail. I may try to level a priest, as I can try healing and if that doesn't work be a DPS/PvP with shadow
---
Undercity, because it's the first city I saw and I've come to like the circular layout

I was 14-15 and was carried up to cthun by a friends guild.

Moonglade!
---
Wait does this actually work? Can you really block someone's mailbox for 3 days like that?
---
i got it a week ago for 4g, there were about 10 up for that price :P
---
looks like i was lucky
---
My gf wants the skins and I don't want to pay for them!
---
Basically just stop being greedy, do what druids normally do, take the loot the healer doesn't need, you can easily run dungeons tanking you will get your set plenty fast.
---
Yeah I'm going to go with this is a story where you are intentionally leaving out critical information, and the point of this post is just to skew things to get people to agree with you. 
---
&gt; I began getting chewed out by one of the other 4 players, who also rolled need on them after I did for the sole reason of preventing me from getting them. 
---
This is where I lose you on it. Here you are claiming that the other 4 DIDNT roll before you, ALL rolled greed, and ONLY rolled on it to spite you of the item, not because they wanted their chance at selling it on the AH. I have a hard time that all 3 of these are true statements. It doesn't make logical sense (not saying everyone does) they that would insist you roll greed, as all rolling need is the same thing. It doesn't make sense why they want to spite you as the only reason for rolling need. It doesn't make sense that the group would all blame you and demand you pay them (especially less likely because its a direct upgrade for you). I believe we are lying/leaving out some truth to the story here. 
---
What I believe is more likely, is that you rolled need after 1-2 greed rolls and would refuse to let those that greeded to roll for it or pay them. Another scenario could be you did all roll need, but you chastised them for rolling need as you believe you were entitled to it since it was an upgrade for you, causing drama and arguing with them that you decided to twist into this story where you portray them as completely crazy (literally makes no sense why they would behave like this).  Like I said, sure there is a chance all of them are crazy, but I believe there is a higher chance of YOU fabricating details or leaving details out compared to this story being accurate. Any screenshots of them all rolling need, or them blaming you first would be the only way I think you can "prove" that you didnt lie/leave stuff out.
---
And then lady is arrested in Stormwind cause of necrophilia, our gentleman is arrested due pedophilia cuz he was actually dead 60 years ago. Today we learn love has no boundaries but community has.
---
You see, what happens is as they run to your pet they see you that you were just faking it, making them **even madder* than before which is why they come running right back down.
---
Did OP mention that a GM approached them?
---
So far all I‚Äôve seen is someone whispering them about it. Not a GM just a guild or/guild officer. 
---
That said, sure it can be weird but I mean that‚Äôs what online play is, interacting with people.  
---
There are people who gank and grief and that‚Äôs okay within the game rules even if we smack talk them.  
---
There are people who steal mobs.  
---
All sorts and we live with them but when a kid plays the game and isn‚Äôt actively grinding someone it‚Äôs time to call it out?
---
While I think it‚Äôs great that the father can share his gaming with their son, I agree that they should keep an eye on what‚Äôs going on in the game. If people whisper or ask them to not follow they should explain the situation to the child and help them correct the course (answering the person in question, guiding the child to play somewhere ese, etc. )
---
if i use ironfoe and deathbringer, 9% hit is good?
---
Karazhan. What could have been.
---
well to be honest.  cleared mc 6 times with full guild so far.   The tanks used the full prot talent in the first 3 and then specced to dw fury talent.
---
The first 2 clear needed 2 day.
---
The last 4 clear was done in 2 hours.
---
I Just feel at home in Thousand Needles. Its just so beautiful.
---
If no one else needs, then sure, state your reasons at the start and roll for it.  Reserving items is the unpopular solution and its totally unnecessary if you communicate with people.
---
I thought "were" when I came up with it but I googled it and all the chintsy keytags with the saying on it say "are" so I compromised.
---
Desolace, because warlock
---
Just remember to wipe your mouth after you taste yourself, buddy.
---
Lvl 39 mage here, best mobs to grind at this lvl? Probably going to grind two levels so I can afford my mount.
---
Your warriors are shit.
---
Do you know how many times you would have to run the dungeon to get healing gear that way?  You would gear out countless healers before yourself.
---
So like 2 healing power
---
Most of them are shit this time around tbh. Only knows how to aoe farm and never spent a second perfecting the pvp skills in the open world.
---
My chance of winning is just as bright as my odds of getting loot in MC as a Shadow Priest
---
Ironforge for sure
---
Ashenvale
---
An addon would probably sort that out.
---
What‚Äôs the range on his fear?  I assumed his fear would make kiting impossible.
---
By that logic everyone should need every item
---
ok.
---
can i haev ur stuff
---
Speak to them? See if they are geared, run with the same healers if they are nice?
---
You are basically saying you want to be a bit of a dick because you don't want to be useful to others or speak to anyone.
---
My workbuddy is always on his phone with remote desktop queing up around lunchtime.

Azshara, because its such a stunning zone
---
Fucking noone recruits a rogue cause their dungeon dps is decent. Fucking noone. I found my guild in the world chat you dread so much and we clear mc and ony in about 3 hours. Conclusion: you have all the solutions spelled out in your post, you just find cheapass excuses not to do anything and then complain cause nothing comes to you by itself. Go retail.
---
That cant be a literal, unironic quote, right?
---
correct.
---
Im a reroll addict
---
Just dinged 60 yesterday and only lack 2-3 BiS pieces, I feel like my time is better spent leveling up a 3rd character to level 60 rather than going for those few pieces i have left, in preparation for Phase 2
---
That way i have more characters I can choose to Rank up on, and I feel confident that you could get enough BiS 2-3 weeks before Phase 2 is announced?
---
Am i wrong in this?
---
I've wondered this about one server that I play with a buddy on. Stormwind's a ghost town, but the population is always medium/high.
---
Pretty short. Kiting makes the fight real easy. Here‚Äôs a video someone posted: https://streamable.com/2ro1x
---
It's your attitude. You're implying their not good because you can bring a mage. By that logic, you'd only bring mages to a raid or to literally anything. it's the elitist attitude that you're perpetuating that is annoying.
---
Um, yeah. Why else would they do it then?
---
Yeah that's a lie. Hasnt been a queue on Skeram for over a month, they removed layers then bam queue.
---
I think with DM already out they should also prioritize BGs (at least those slated for p3). Otherwise the locations in front of instance portals get even worse than they already are on pvp servers. But I expect to get more useful information next week, when Blizzcon is.
---
Because as people get smarter and better at optimizing, they realize that rolling need on expensive BoE's is the correct move. For a small 2-5g bracer it should just go to OP, but for expensive items you should be rolling need on BoE's.
---
My favourite: Distract and watch them panic.
---
Probably Teldrassil. The music, the aesthetic, magical feeling, with generally nice questing layout that's easy to optimize. Also my first leveling zone ever so the nostalgia factor :D
---
Join a guild.
---
Same boat. Even called them out on it before we started. Now almost all quit.
---
Its titanpabel with its default plugins.
---
I would also like to know.
---
About to dive right into classic and rolled up a paladin. Wondering how they perform in dungeons and PvP. (Battleground and wPvP) are they able to fill all three roles in dungeons or is there any that they perform poorly in? And then again for raids, by the little I've heard it seems in raiding they're best as healers.
---
Gonna be sticking with the class just wondering will I have versatility at 60 or realistically only have one role.
---
Fellwood forest by far, that's where my rhok'delar story began. And can't wait to grab the popcorn haha.

Its your own money and time invested in this game so its up to how you want to enjoy classic.

Wiping on Golemagg the Loot Pinata OMEGALUL
---
If the decision is whether to bring a shadowpriest or not, then yea you should use that data. And it's already been worked out to be 4+ warlocks. But when the question is "are shadowpriest good DPS", then factoring in their raid buff isn't really fair, though that's a completely subjective argument.
---
Whats about flagcarry as druid?  
---
You can also play a balance orientated specc and nuke them down with big crits starfire in bg's. much fun
---
Not much else to say than this.
---
When classic came out a large group of people i knew were considering playing. None of them held through. Found a guild with likeminded individuals - been having a blast from day one.
---
It's also a 30 min CD for a shield that absorbs a whopping 500 damage. It's in no way worth anything to a warrior.
---
it's likely because you insta press Need on everything, so the others do it too to reduce your ninjaing chances.
---
Duskwood. Tis the season to be Spooky.
---
TESLA 420$
---
Yes which distinguishes it from your statment saying LESS PLAYERS.
---
I know that words have meanings and sometimes different words that are sort of the same still mean different things. This is hard for you to understand but someday maybe you will be able to grasp basic concepts. Keep trying.
---
The 10% armor is pretty good though right?
---
It's only a problem if you are really trying to minmax your dps but honestly raiding in classic is much more about not fucking up rather than topping the dps meters and in phase 1 warlocks arent the best anyways
---
Ironforge
---
Packed cities are great!
---
Gehennas is still on 2 layers aswell, so once they reduce that to 1 queues will increase way more, just like they did on the US servers yesterday/today.
---
Friends of mine joined for the nostalgia of childhood and not to explore and quest together. They may have places outside the game they want to explore more, but it's not a game you have to zoom through. Just enjoy the small interactions with others. Give the others in the community a chance. 
---
You may never know the name or face of a player you've partied with for a day or for weeks, but you know you can rely on them for the roles they played in dungeons or just a small buff to make leveling a little easier. 
---
You're sad 3 folks aren't playing...but there are thousands of others who are desperately in need of a healer as much as you are in need of a tank and d33ps.
---
Until you add them to your KOS list, then he randomly pops up in BRM 15 levels later and you mercilessly gank him and bring balance to the Force.
---
Many of the people who enjoy the slow burn of Classic also enjoy the slow burn of long term factional grudges. It's fantastic fun and I can't wait for the chaos of Phase 2.
---
Imagine all blizzard's plot twists, with Classic mechanics, that's what I would call WOW 2
---
you can see server population here:

Ragnaros‚Äô lair.
---
Thanks for linking it.. I was in a hurry yesterday
---
&gt; this leaves a lot of points to be put into other spec, you could put up to 34 points into Fury and still tank with a shield
---
If you tank with a shield most of the time you should pick up shield slam 100%
---
most likely yes
---
Join a guild.  You can make new friends.  Almost all people who start up leveling together in games like this will end up splitting.  The question is are you having enough fun to want to do that?
---
Hi, /u/DeathbymyWind
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dlx0jq/can_someone_please_explain_how_i_can_sell_a/). 
---
Give them a renew and they can manage their own lifetaps. If they life tap aggressively and kill themselves to aggro or an aoe, enjoy the repairs it's self inflicted.
---
That whole guild already had a shady reputation from pservers, this just confirmed that rumors are true.
---
&gt; because you don't want to be useful to others 
---
It's the opposite.  I don't want to be used like a dirty cum rag.  
---
I make a group for DM west.  There is NOTHING I want in this dungeon.    We do it, healer #1 gets the healing gear, and leaves.  Do it again, healer $2 gets gear and leaves.  repeat ad infinitum.   I can only get gear if the healer has it already, which is unlikely, because otherwise they wouldn't run it.  
---
So, I'll spend countless hours gearing every healer on the server so I can get maybe eventually get the gear.
---
Dont come here. Its the same people who created this issue on here defending it.
---
Im totally with you. Too many min maxing nerds. Not a fun community. Everything is too serious. 
---
Just look at any thread on here where someone have a issue with the game. OP instantly gets ridiculed and the actual topic gets no attention. Its always. "uhh poor you" "Git GUUD" etc etc.
---
I rerolled on a RPPVP server yesterday in hopes of a better crowd.
---
Just wait until we have enough +hit to hit the broad side of a barn!
---
I feared them and focused one down.
---
It's a learned behavior from private servers. Having so many people on them made it super easy for people to ninja and get away with it. You would occasionally have one guy that spammed your name for a few hours, but you could just log off and people would forget you, so people just needed to prevent any drama. 
---
Also, some items are just worth too much to give for a minor upgrade, like shadowfang. That'll probably sell for 100g, so why would you want to let some guy use it for just a few levels?
---
Blackrock Mountain, including all the instanced zones, Upper and Lower Blackrock Spire, Blackrock Depths and Molten Core. The sheer scale of the place, and the amount of time it must have taken to create it. The amount of lore tied into it and of course, it just looks and feels really cool.
---
How do you bind abilities on action bar 2?
---
*B REZ ON ZOOLACE*
---
I did Molten Core once, and as soon as the entire raid group unleashed on Sulfuron Harbinger my PC froze for a solid 3 minutes. I only alt-F4‚Äôd when they killed it in case it disqualified me for loot.
---
Strangely, the sound continued and I could hear everything but my graphics card basically gave up.
---
Every time I entered Shattrath in BC was at least a 1 minute freeze, too. Upgraded pretty soon after that!
---
So you don't need any tank gear at all?
---
Then find a healer who's after some specific loot, let him take that and take everything else, I don't get the issue this has been how druids have done stuff forever.
---
Aah that is a good ressource as well, but I meant this video https://youtu.be/28F_02cm8Y8

are holy paladins good for 39/49 lvl BGs? I will probably never even reach lvl 60 on my main but I am already thinking about something that I could twink with in higher lvl BGs

Is there there some kind of addon or something to track the Consumables used in a Raid setting? Not just mine from the whole raid.

Feralas. More specifically the Northern areas and around Twin Colossals with it's vast, enchanted forest, giants, waterfalls and shoreline. Last week I finally got my epic mount and got to ride through Feralas and talk to Rexxar for my Onyxia necklace, and once more visit all those old places in Northern Feralas, and continue to the South and over to Dire Maul. It is good to be back!
---
Lasher farm is the only viable aoe farm for priests. Its still good gph especially if you have herbalism.
---
He got banned by Blizzard, it's the only authority that matters in this case.
---
Could it be a false positive? sure, if so will it wil probably get overturned, but the odds of that are miniscule.
---
&gt; A bot automatically throwing out a ban as a result of logging in from a different ip isn‚Äôt proof that he was account sharing.
---
You don't know if that is what happend, you're just assuming that based on what OP has said, which could all be lies, the only thing that we know is that he got banned for "exchange of real world currency", and even that could be a lie, he hasn't shown any sort of proof of anything.

You may know the area from your recent frequent runs to Dire Maul, or perhaps from your Nat Pagle quest, but for me the little nook under the bridge will always be special.
---
It is the spot where 14 years ago an old friend and I roleplayed. He taught me the value of fishing, explained the different seasonal fish, and the market value of Stonescale Eels. Classic is a living breathing world because we all have little experiences like that.
---
Stranglethorn Vale!  
---
I spend / have spend so much time there questing, farming, fishing PvP'ing. :)
---
players QI nowadays is really low...

I‚Äôve been lvling a feral druid, currently at 45. 
---
I have loved the feral druid because I can use cat form to quest, bear form to tank dungeons, and just switch my gear to heal.
---
All you need is to keep some Int and Spirit gear in your bags and you will be able to switch out to heal. The only problem that I have faced is that the healing roll is currently oversaturated. I have found it almost impossible to find open healing slots, so I pretty much always end up tanking.
---
However, at end game, druids still heal.
---
What about needing cos in a couple levels they can use?
---
Yeah i didnt want to go too big with the numbers. If they would remove layers from Lucifron next sunday morning we would face maybe 10k+, that would be the pop of another fresh server not even out yet.
---
There is nothing practical the playerbase could do here. Transfer to a also full server? And that server then also having faction imbalance?
---
an expedient solution, satan.
---
What if I only reserved 1 item at a time?  I didn't mean to imply that I would reserve everything.
---
Please be my friend
---
Its not, it is just gold to them. Gold != getting that epic drop.
---
I‚Äôm actually pretty surprised by this.  He was definitely appeared to be in range of fear on a number of occasions (at least from my experience doing the fight) and didn‚Äôt get hit with it once.  
---
Also, I don‚Äôt see how this hot fix addresses this strat at all?  Seemed like the bugs all stayed aggro, but maybe I missed something.
---
It just depends on what you use your hearth for, and how often. If youre max level and you primarely use a bank alt for selling and banking, setting hearth to IF wouldn't be a priority (as is the case for me). I like menethil very much.
---
You can return them without paying I think.
---
Jintha'alor in Hinterlands.
---
Just love the view from up there and the feel of this giant Troll base.
---
This looks okay i guess, thanks!

This guy getting blasted all over. Hahahaha.

somebody is trying to scamm you, dont send anything.

Its not.
---
Best pvp pets are:
---
1. Frenzied Bloodseeker Bat (available once ZG drops)
---
2. Broken Tooth
---
3. Spiteflayer
---
In that order.
---
The fuck are you talking about
---
You have to MC them then I have to click on them again, even though I'm already targeting them, then hit fort or the heal you wanna use.
---
If I don't click on them again, I end up just using the buff on myself.
---
Ironforge. Best city in the game.
---
Brill. In original Vanilla I played an undead character and I had some great times PvPing in Brill. For the longest time my hearthstone was set there and when I saw the alliance attacking Brill in WorldDefense I'd hearth back to where my adventure started and defend my "home."
---
I'm currently level 46 on my destro lock and I regularly get 850+ conflag crits, 650+ shadowburn crits, and 400+ searing pain crits. I have a lot more spell power than most level 46s but I'm sure you can still do big damage with average gear.
---
Yea I don‚Äôt get it either. Bugs on Solenor never reset for me either. I could see this fixing Simone, since the pet isn‚Äôt supposed to lose aggro; at least it didn‚Äôt back when I killed her in vanilla.
---
Another user summarised this argument pretty well. 
---
"It's worth the same to everyone since we can all sell it, therefore we should all need it!"
---
No, it is clearly worth more to the person who equips it. Why? Because they have chosen to equip it rather than sell it. Granted, it's possible for people to roll on items that are terrible for them, but most of the time this isn't the case.
---
Felwood

L45 fdruid. When to spec to resto? I already have a healing set and I‚Äôm planning to do many dungeons before 60.
---
Always been Un'goro for me, always the jungle zones of Azeroth. So sad it's such a short zone for leveling.
---
ZulGurub. Since I joined vanilla as a wee lad all those years ago, I was huge fan of trolls and all connected to them. So when I first went to ZG with my guild it was a pure bliss - drums music, troll architecture, troll bosses, loa. Up to this day stays as my favorite location through expansions.
---
Stormwind, I still remember the 1st time walked up to it on my human paladin I stood starting at it for ages then went exploring the inside conpletly forgetting about the quest I was on.
---
You should be fine clearly stating you plan to roll for resto spec even if you're playing another spec for that dungeon. If you are putting together a group, whisper your potential healer before inviting them in to get their OK. If they don't agree, find another healer.
---
It's a shitty move to reserve items. It's not a shitty move to agree to non-standard loot rules when everyone is made aware of the new rules well in advanced.
---
They get the skill to ride the Deathcharger anyway
---
To each their own I guess. Mind sharing your setup?
---
Check out shadowpanther.net it has great information about gear for rogues for both pve and pvp.
---
Whipvine, Padre's, Animated Chain Neck, Second Wind, Senior Designer's, Hands of the Exalted...
---
In a guild run, you would never split the profits. You'd all hit need, and congratulate the guy who just won 1000g. I'd never expect a guildie or friend to share, that's just greedy.
---
Just farm gold instead and buy a 16 bag
---
As a rogue it is my duty to troll people into thinking I‚Äôm killing them.
---
Deathbringer is a shitty offhand though, pass it to someone who will use it in mainhand instead.
---
Ease up Donald
---
It would depend on the healer, if they already have that item or if they need it badly or not.
---
You would not be able to get me to heal DM:W for anything if you tried to sell the run as "Mindtap Talisman reserved", but some other piece? I'd listen. It comes down to searching for the right healer and being diplomatic and clear with your intentions. If all those things click, then it should be fine. And if some piece not discussed beforehand drop, inspect the healer, check if they need, ask if it's OK if you need - or if everyone greeds, just ask if you can grab for healing offspec.
---
I learned a long time ago with games don't rely on your friends to get enjoyment from it. I too had many people play classic from launch and 90% have stopped playing now. I just made new friends with people I didn't know that were like minded. It takes a little bit longer to find people you want to play with but once you find people with the same mindset on the game its much more fun.
---
Just to clear it up, regular mail or things you‚Äôve bought etc stay in your inbox for 30 days to claim, CODs are 3 days
---
Round Robin:
---
&gt; "roundrobin" looting cycles evenly through group members.
---
tHAT SOUNDS THE SAME AS RESERVING ITEMS, BUT NOT BEING OPEN ABOUT IT.
---
Keep it well fed and spam instances
---
Respecc'ing your pet costs much less, than respecc'ing your talents, so just spend the points
---
People will hate you for the sounds a carrion bird makes with its skills, keep that in mind :)
---
what. How little do you value credible sources? Why listen to a guy telling the tales of others if you could instead listen to a guy talking about his own deeds.
---
Lasher farming is still 40-50g an hour depending on your servers AH prices. I doubt there are better spots than that.
---
Hate to break it to you most likely the tanks wanting the casters instead of you to their groups is because they are after dps loot.
---
For warlock epic mount quest, do i need to complete both the chain quest in Felwood and handing over arcanite bars+shadow power pot+... to get the quest [Dreadsteed of Xoroth]? Because i have done the Felwood chain and Imp delivery (scholo) but there is no next quest.
---
I don't watch Tips either, but it's quite hilarious how mad you Redditors are getting over this. It's also obvious that Pilav is jealous because he's banned off Twitch and couldn't milk Classic content himself.
---
Meanwhile all his dick-suckers down vote any comment that's not shitting on Tips because "streamers reeeeeeeeeee!!!!"
---
Imagine still clinging onto retail because of your achievements and titles, like as if anyone but yourself even cares?
---
Bit of an exaggeration don‚Äôt you think. Would still have been able to get to 60.
---
Heal in DPS spec as long as it's doable, questing and soloing becomes a lot slower afterwards. Prepare to pop a lot of potions around the 50's and forward. 
---
Druid is a bit more problematic than other healers since if someone dies during a pull, it's either burning combat rez or having them run (unless someone else can rez).
---
Being pedantic about the term used has nothing to do with the US.  My response was to the "all you're doing is pressing a couple of buttons" part, I could care less about saying tip/fee.  
---
Either way it's clear they expect that they should pay nothing, when the time invested in learning a profession + recipe cost should come into play.
---
so items that say restore xmana per 5 seconds ... what do those items do  now ?
---
Piece of shit sounds fitting for this kind of behavior
---
Reserving items is saying "I'm taking this for myself, you cannot have it". 
---
Saying "I'm going to roll on these items" still gives the other person an opportunity to roll on them too. The fundamental difference here is that your healer still has opportunity for loot, there's just more competition for it.
---
I would recommend just joining a casual guild together.
---
There are tons of changes. The clock on the minimap for example. That was added in 2.4.3 in TBC.
---
Killing 3/4 mobs as Ret would leave you oom even in that spec so not a huge difference. Holy shield defo helps and a shield spike. Really push the block bonus damage.
---
Alright thank you!
---
Yay you're playing on a full realm. Yay you don't care about overpopulation.
---
No, Hakkar is way less terrifying.
---
If you just wanna farm mobs you might aswell do cath spellcleave. Nice gold and exp
---
I thought it would be fun to start a guild but then ‚Äúrecruiting‚Äù was tedious and most low levels now are alts so aren‚Äôt online much, so I have GM role to an alt of mine (with some help) and joined another guild, which is active and friendly.
---
My advice: forget about being in a guild for now. Play the game. If you run a dungeon or party to do quests with someone you feel is on your wavelength, ask if the guild is recruiting. And you can always leave/switch guilds if the first one you find doesn‚Äôt suit.
---
Honestly I‚Äôm so happy in my guild. They have about 20 level 60s, raid, and also lots of ‚Äúon the way‚Äù players whose mains are like 25-59. In level 33 and have grouped with them loads since joining last week. I‚Äôm so glad I ditched my own guild (even if it had a better name) and joined an already active one.
---
The queue screen !
---
Brillaint name Ketlord, you've earned it!
---
It drops off of any level 50+ mob not just strat... I got one farming mobs in Aszhara.
---
I respecced at level 55. ST was the first dungeon I felt healing while feral was becoming a bit difficult
---
I've been playing since vanilla and I would never be a guild master. People expect you to know exactly what you're doing. If you just started I would heavily advise against it seeing as though you don't know  how to raid or do any end game strategies at all. Wait... are you on an RP server? Cause that's a different story
---
I never had any problems with that. A few days ago a Warrior rolled need on Foror's Compendium of Dragon Slaying and everyone was fine with it.
---
This. Running a guild takes a certain type of individual.
---
Pro-tip: 99% of players don‚Äôt even notice what level your pet is.
---
Youre misunderstanding, im saying speed has nothing to do with it. Obviously weapon dps matters
---
&gt; That‚Äôs why the statement ‚Äúguilty until proven innocent‚Äù is being criticized.
---
you seem to simply not understand why I said that, Blizzard is the utmost authority in this case and they judged him guilty (before that point he was innocent until proven guilty), therefore hes currently guilty until proven otherwise, that is literally what the appeal process is. he stays banned unless he provides blizzard with sufficient evidence to refute the ban.
---
Healers run arena because it's the next best instance to XP, after Mara, and leveling is priority. Any good loot is a bonus.
---
And there are a couple good caster drops from Arena.
---
And then of course Arena runs usually turn into Angerforge runs because if you don't do more than *just* arena, you get locked out and can't continue because arena runs only take like 7 minutes. And then now that you're doing Angerforge, Golem Lord is right next door and ALL the casters want him.
---
So yes, healers very much want Arena/BRD. I never had a problem filling healer role.

Ctrl+left click on Questie minimap icon reloads just Questie. Just mouseover that icon for more stuff.
---
No need for complete reload.
---
What do you aim to use the pet for?
---
Never bring a bird inside pve content. Its just a pain in the ass for your tank and melee. Wolf for raids and cats for 5-mans.
---
If you want to pvp with the bird i'd switch it to spiteflayer with 1.2 attackspeed instead of 2.0 for spell pushback.
---
Loyalty level gets a time cap. So you need to wait a certain time before the next level. Dont have the exact times in my head. But spend points as soon as you get them. First the basic bite/claw, growl, dive and screech then into res, stam or armor.
---
Did the devilsaur timers get changed?
---
&gt; Is it 18 slot or why do ppl want to farm it so bad
---
This is how achievements looked like before achievements.
---
Is cross-faction collusion (Devilsaur Mafia) against TOS or is it allowed?
---
Ok.
---
My buddy asked me to roll on Skeram right before classic launched...as alliance....needless to say he is gone and I‚Äôm waiting for paid server xfers  to become a thing...
---
This is a fun idea, actually.
---
True as Ret I would probably using a pot or CD to survive 3 mobs, I‚Äôd be running if there was 4 mobs.
---
For me the first trailer theme. Always givis me the chills
---
You can ride Barons mount specifically. Same with the ZG Raptors
---
I'm sending my Icemail Jerkin to my bank alt to DE it.   The 2 Essence are worth more.
---
&gt;3 mobs leaves me OOM 
---
Welcome to paladin, enjoy your stay ;)
---
So, what do I do?  LFM healer (I'm gonna roll on healing gear)
---
Not being sarcastic, how does layering affect queue times? I thought the queue was because the server was at capacity? Layering is for multiple layers on one server, so that the world isn't too crowded. Nothing to do with server capacity. That's why they increased server capacity when the queue times were insane at launch. Rather than just adding more layers.
---
Please correct me if I'm wrong!
---
join a guild join a discord and find people to play with this game isnt about getting your loot right now its about playing with a guild and working to get loot
---
if one of our guild needs an item then we will help to get it .
---
You're reducing maybe one warlocks damage lol. It's one debuff slot, hardly noticeable.
---
Obviously joining a guild is best, but if you're not in one, play with people, be courageously (not naively) trusting and take notes, who is competent, friendly, who is selfish and crappy. Build yourself a network and then create a guild, or ask those people you admire if you can join their guild.
---
Spies char uses a second account.
---
I also use it sometimes to sing "Baby Shark" and Rebecca Black's "Friday" to alliance waiting for the boat at the dock. Because sometimes ganking people isn't cruel enough.
---
You sound salty. Did a mage ruin your fun in the past?
---
How much 'up-to-date' gear needs to be for healing dungeons? I have couple of pieces from around 20ish level all of them spirit and int but I dont know if thats enough. I hate to be that guy that has to bad of a gear to do his role in dungoen...
---
Well, not the epic robe patterns for classes I'm not.
---
I hadn‚Äôt scanned the auction house in a long time. That was probably a pretty old number. It‚Äôs currently on ah for around 29g
---
What would you guys say are the easiest classes to solo-rank as in phase 2?
---
Im not great at finding designated groups to play with most of the time
---
It's not *Rattlegore*, it's a PVP server.  You had a choice, and this is what you chose.
---
What did you expect`? xD Don't ask for no more layer if you don't want it to look like that.
---
Aoe= int &gt; stam &gt; sp
---
Raids = sp &gt; int &gt; stam
---
PvP = int ‚â• stam &gt; sp
---
I am not good at making friends, and I dont' want to talk on discord.
---
How do you get xp without exploring the world?..
---
Hello guys, i wanted just to ask...
---
i cant decide between Hunter or Rogue ...Mainly i want Focus on BGs/WPVP (more BGs) ofc some PVE but not mainly...its hard for me to decide cuz, i love both playstyles melee and range can you give me some advice? prob. - Pro's and Con's... or just whats overall better? It would help me alot !! thank you very much
---
As mentioned above you need a guild, and don't just settle for the first guild you find, TRY the guild for a few days or a week and if you simply don't click with people in that guild then move to another, eventually you will find an awesome one. 
---
As for shadow spec, you absolutely do not need it for soloing, as long as you have spirit tap and wand spec talents you can kill things with no down time. Just my opinion but I actually prefer this zero downtime combat to the burst damage of shadow and then having to sit and drink. If you need anymore info about grinding as holy I'd be happy to help there.
---
So far they haven't done anything about it, and the current TOS does not have anything against it.
---
Hell they even let you add enemy players as battle net friends and chat with them in-game.
---
I feel like every red name plate on heartseeker is super aggressive. 
---
Made it to 56 and rerolled on a different server :/
---
Pet was Dismiss.
---
Darkshire
---
All this min max shit and BiS talk is just not what the game was like for semi-casual raiding back in the day. We got 40 people together and went in. 
---
Got three or more tanks? We're good
---
Got five or more healers? Well ok then. 
---
Learn raid through online education and experience, get better, increase the general gear level across the guild. 
---
Enjoy yourselves over an evening in MC. No bitching at people for gear levels, no reserving gear for the above average damage classes, just 40 people enjoying an evening playing together. 
---
There's a natural progression for the "L337 players go for the WIN" to find another hungrier guild that wants to compete rather than just enjoy, and that's all good. They've learned the basics with us and then they are ambitious and want to get on. But an awful lot of players just wanted good company, a bit of bitching between class channels, and the comfortable success of working out how to get a win. 
---
No harm in both types of people being in the game, that's what it's about, but suggesting that support classes shouldn't be included if they can't hit those damage targets is just bollocks.
---
Jesus Christ can you be more condescending? Maybe I don't want to spend a bunch of time describing in thorough detail a very niche and unusual issue on a very specific part of a UI menu and would find it easier for both parties to just show the exact bug?
---
By all means assholes, fucking crucify me for thinking that it makes sense to visually show an interface bug to people who make VIDEO games. Christ
---
Few ways to do this:
---
"LFG Tank (rolling for resto spec)"
---
When putting together a group and a healer whispers for invite: "Hey FYI, I plan to roll mainspec resto, are you cool with that?"
---
When joining a new group: "Hey guys, I'm currently playing Feral, but would like to roll mainspec Resto, are you guys cool with that?"
---
It depends on your lvl, the lvl of the people you are running with and which dg you run.
---
For a level 30, having some early 20s casting gear is decent. You can always run some dungeon slightly lower than you to stock up on some more just to be sure.
---
It was always so obvious to me that "need" is only for "i will equip" or "i will equip once i've reach required level (like needing a lvl 30 staff when you're a 28 mage). Anything else is a greed or a pass... Why is this so hard for people?
---
As a warrior you need too accept any challenger even frost mages.
---
Do you mind if i ask about multiboxing? i only found out it was a legitimate thing recently as i‚Äôm new to wow, but coming from other games iv always played multiple accounts at the same time. What are the benefits of doing it in wow?
---
Can I have your gold?
---
Not rly. Some slots are decent.
---
You seem to be mistaking or equating primary sources and credible sources.
---
You skipped raid, and in turn, your commitment to 39 other people to ... explore a level 5 cave?
---
Just find a guild
---
&gt; players QI nowadays is really low... 
---
wait a second...
---
I tjink all who reserve otems are retarded
---
the raiding rule of hit is at 300 weapon skill you need 9% hit rating to cap special abilities (yellow damage attacks like heroic strike, etc), So those won‚Äôt miss on a lv 63 (aka raid boss). More hit will   only be beneficial to your white auto attacks. 
---
5% Hit Rating = PvP / lv 60 
---
9% Hit Rating = Raid Boss Special Hit Cap
---
*note: need to be standing behind the boss to avoid parry and dodge
---
26ish% Hit Rating = Raid boss auto Attack Hit Cap, again, while standing behind the boss. 
---
+5 to swords and maces specialization is hit under the hood, meaning at 305 weapon skill you basically get what equates to a passive 3% hit rating. 
---
So then from talents or gear you need 2% hit for pvp. 6% for Raids. 23 or for auto attacks. 
---
So you can swap out gear and take some of that hit and put it into crit, or leave it ass is and it will reduce your auto attack misses. More hit will also help you attack from the front, which you may find happening in pvp, where you can‚Äôt always get behind them as they run to get behind you.
---
You'll have no problem doing either tank/heal/dps during leveling if you plan accordingly. Endgame (raid) tanking is out of question though. You CAN find a guild who takes you as a ret, but realisticly you are much better off as holy in both pvp and pve.
---
Throneroom in Undercity, everytime I go in there with ambience music it gives me the chills and flashbacks to that awesome cut scene with Arthas entering that room in WC3:TFT
---
Marshal's Refuge Cave in Un'Goro Crater because it's pretty :)
---
Save it, it definitely has copy/pasta potential
---
Healing paladins are top tier in both PVE and PVP. DPS paladins are not particularly good at both, though they do get pretty scary in PVP given enough gear. As tanks, only for leveling and maybe lvl 60 dungeons if you're desperate.
---
I got into a bidding war with a Guild mate a week or two ago. We didn't know it was each other until I said "Man this is so much damn fun, I'm having a blast bidding and getting outbid just to bid again on this stuff!" and he's like "Yeah, it's great!" it was then we realized - we were in a bid war with each other, so the bid war continue until I just let him have it cause he had placed a bid much higher than vendor price which was the only reason I was buying the item. Then someone came and outbid him on the item at the last second by increasing the price to about 10x what it was actually worth just to assure a victory.
---
Moonglade
---
Nah, he probably would not have been 60 last night.  There are TONS of times you do this on a warrior while questing, would have ended up dead more times to count.
---
Oh thanks finally figured it out, now it‚Äôs time to spread the love!
---
Also, get a shadow wand, and wand mastery. When you need to Regen Mana, you can do 40% wand damage as you keep shadow weaving up.  Just saying, shadow priest have cool tools to compete with.
---
So sort by top instead of new.  You choose to see this...
---
Brill is the best and y‚Äôall know it
---
He straight up talked about it during the duel tournament... I‚Äôll find a VoD with a time stamp (check payos VoD when he was dueling in Hyjal) in like 8 hours when I wake up... but yea he‚Äôs so stupid he doesn‚Äôt realize how stupid he comes across by talking about it.
---
My favorite place is hillsbrad foothills / alterac because it boarders the marked plague lands which are rich in lore and so are the foothills. Furthermore it shows the conflict between forsaken and humans. Even tho I'm a horde player I totally adore the human lore of Warcraft!
---
No I remember the other way from 15 years ago
---
most sport analysts aren‚Äôt professional players
---
I have been banned before by mistake twice, same reason. Sent a ticket, they reviewed and it was ok.
---
Sen'jin
---
You will go oom every pull if you try to solo aoe. Holy shield helps with damage but you will oom even quicker. You either keep tanking, stay prot and just live with the slower leveling or respec ret and focus on questing instead of tanking. Your call.
---
P.S. If you can find a healer, prot pally works wonders. You can aoe just about anything, especially with a druid.
---
Yeah it sure is "free" when you're farming it for 4 hours like the guy above
---
I meant killing 3/4 back to back would make you Oom fighting 3 at once is risky and will definitely use some CDs. Best thing as a prot pally is try to find a mage who wants to Aoe with you. At level 50+ you can just farm EPL.
---
Warlocks have a lot of tricks to regain HP themselves. Just heal them as a last priority, if you have spare mana.  Or just leave them to their own. 
---
If they pull aggro, they die, but that's their own fault.
---
Oh yeah? 
---
How about my 4 wives and 20 kids, and 4 jobs. I got lvl 2 yesterday finally w00t!
---
Wouldn't it be more effective farming gold normally and just buying a different 16slotter..?
---
Wonder what might be the cause for this change, if respawn timers have been decreased as you report.. Hmm..
---
Teldrassil for sure!
---
I have a 60 paladin, and even though I toiled through a lot of crap groups to get my pre-raid bis to start raiding with I found out that I find Paladins quite boring to play and just using it to bank roll my alt's while I do some raiding on the side with my guild. To be honest, I find dungeon running to get pre-raid bis without say a dedicated group to be really fustrating, so I completely understand why leveling is more fun than griding out some gear everyone else is going to roll on.  
---
You definitely not wrong, it's all down to what you feel like is a better use of your time - especially if it's a means to an end to have better flexibility for professions or money making.
---
Shoulders, bracers, belt, gloves, and boots.
---
I love Silverpine Forest.  I'd like to say that Blizzard did an absolutely¬†amazing¬†job revamping this zone. There are plenty of horde flight points, and the leveling flow is great. The best part? The absolutely amazing, engaging quests. The storyline of the zone is fantastic.
---
Shadowfang Keep too !!!
---
No char Transfers in classic wow except the ones from full to low Pop Servers
---
Depends on how much PvP you want to do in phase 2 - you need both gear and more importantly money for that
---
Well to be fair you have 3 lvl 60s while most people have none. I‚Äôd honestly take a break from wow because I know getting my rogue to 60 took a lot of my time.
---

Hoping to get an MC invite on my level 58 mage tonight. Got about 4/5 pieces of BiS pre raid and can get buffs/consumables. Guild run. Am I right to ask for a place over some randoms or will I hold the run back?
---
If I need something I just buy it out.

Has layering been turned off on Shazzrah?
---
Honestly, Moonglade, it's such a peaceful place to just hang out.
---
This dude has ridiculous gear I just think he's trying to flex at this point. I feel like anyone who has farmed up the gear he has must know that a speedy off hand and a slow MH is the way to go, and that swords are the inherently superior choice over any other weapon for humans. But hey if he wants to DW IF and Deathbringer, by god he's earned it.

Communication is key. Rolling for two roles is usually a greedy move unless nobody else needs it. If you communicate that you are rolling for healer gear beforehand, I don't see an issue in rolling for it
---
well there is only far your gonna get without communicating
---
I guess something like Maraudon, high enough that kills still give XP, low enough that it is doable with an untrained pet.

His dad had a construction company that took on a big contract doing repairs or and addition for a university in california. If I recall correctly they took the money and did basically none of the work. A big lawsuit followed. Tips isn't implicated in any of it though and should therefore not be lambasted for it, no matter how much you dislike the guy.

If its just some random blue boe thats not worth much and is good for your spec, need &amp; equip it. If its something worth a lot on the ah (boe epics or BiS items for lvl 19/29/39 pvp alts) everyone should roll need, because someone in the group is always guaranteed to roll need too for selling.

Vanilla playerrr!!
---
he only does the fear IF you immobilized him with wing clip
---
As for the video of kiting, tried it myself multiple times, problem is he would reset for no apparent reasons (even had him reset just after I successfully hit him with an attack) so it's not a reliable strategy

Yes. Spawn timers changed. Prices have already been dropping

Seriously nope not because things like this screw with the economy. Gold is already in abundance.

You can't make an addon display stuff in 3D space. As the API doesn't allow that. All you can do is display numbers in the 2D UI space.

Might want to make sure you're wearing plate with a few mail pieces, not leather with a few plate&amp;mail pieces. Keep an eye on healer mana.

If you wanted to fly over the world and avoid Warcraft from point A to B, then I guess flying mounts where perfect in that sense.   I for one hate flying mounts.

Can someone explain this to me I‚Äôm new to wow classic and have no idea what this is about
---
Maybe I should've said "sub-zones". But nonetheless that's still a lot of important places, including the entire Tempest Keep instance hub, the entire Ogrilla section in western blade's edge mountains, the netherwing island and many more. There's literally no way to reach these places without flying.

If you never wingclip him, then he never fears you. So you can just kite him without getting feared. By far the easiest way to kill him.
---
I laughed for about 3solid minutes, thanks! xD
---
As per Blizzard rules, if the Ironfoe would have dropped, it would have been ninja-looting for the whoever who reserved it to take it without rolling, unless everyone else agreed on it. So basically, if you reserve something and forget (or "forget") to tell about it to everyone in the group before starting, then it is **not** reserved.
---
This is how my guild got our core. Started from a few tanks/dps, around 10 people, and built up to 40
---
1g seems to be standard for random portals, might increase once players get richer, but you should offer to make one for your dungeon groups and raids when you're done.
---
Based on this post: https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/layered-realms-update-oct-22/340582
---
it hasnt yet. It's also the biggest or 2nd biggest EU server, so I kinda doubt it.
---
But maybe it's related other realms having it removed.
---
What do you mean by depressing? Does it take longer to kill stuff? Do you go OOM quicker?
---
I honestly don‚Äôt mind killing things slower so long as I‚Äôm not having to drink after 2/3 pulls. I never had that issue with the disc + spirit tap build i was running before 40.

I wouldn't recommend it, not worth at all

not really. ive used deathbringer offhand done double the damage in a raid than i would if i used mirahs song, i dont get it

I've seen all orbs reserved, all greens and all non-MS blues reserved. So the ONLY thing you get out of running that is the actual item you want, assuming it's MS, and some random greys and whites.

Wow. I always think of my server is well populated but it looks nothing like that at peak times (although, it is quite heavily dominated by other faction)

Thelsamar in Loch Modan. It has so much peace and atmosphere in a game otherwise focused on war. It will always be a nostalgic spot for me.
---
It would still be a bigger upgrade for someone else who would use it in mainhand, gotta gear as a team in vanilla nobody cares about your individual logs.

So bindings were open roll? You didn't tell people up front that your guilds main tank was 100% going to get a 1/32 chance item if it dropped? That you were willing to roll against every single other person that could swing a sword?
---
Its literally the biggest or second biggest upgrade you can buy for your character depending on your hit%, but I guess you would say respeccing to an PvE spec is min-maxing as well... GL on Roblox!
---
The concept of Rolling all need on blue boes is for stuff that can fetch several hundred gold on the ah not like 5-10g in a few months.

Birds are awesome, good for tanking up to LBRS, and can off-tank UBRS easily enough.
---
Being general, but for dungeons under 45, they have it better.  Comparing gnomergan to SM, Stocks to RFC, easier access to RFK, RFD, and BFD. DM/VC is probably better than WC though, but I think that‚Äôs more of personal opinion.

Too much hit isn't a thing for fury warriors. Aim for like 13-17%.

---
Yes, you need to complete both chains. The mat turnin quests are mandatory, unfortunately.
---
Huh, had no idea the fear was linked to wing clip.  I wish you could redo these fights since they‚Äôre a ton of fun, and I‚Äôd love to try some of these other strats.
---
Yep, tanks is not the same as warriors, but I don't mind tanking on mine, and nobody is going to oppose a warrior tank, whereas people might oppose paladin tank (due to no taunt) or druid (for whatever reason, no blocks maybe?). I don't plan on raiding, my playing times are so limited that it's probably not going to happen. So far my characters are L40 and L30 so neither of them is likely to see L60 before the end of this year.
---
ppl already have it during the time i was in the raid. it was a greed roll so i ended up getting it

the Cactus in front of Ogrimmar Bank

It would have to be one of the major cities. Definitely not Undercity or Darnassus, though... Hmmm....I'd have to say Stormwind. When I first saw that place it took my breath away. I probably spent the next three hours just wandering around the city.

Does removing your gear bypass the rez sickness durability decrease?

The quest starts out in STV. Scrolls on the bloodsail captains boats.

You reddit autists need /s for everything don't you? How do you possibly communicate in real life?

---
Winterspring. Straight up.
---
Blackrock mountain, because as a rogue, it's the best place to camp out and easily use distract to kill people by making them suddenly turn into the lava.
---
The AH is too far away from the mailbox/bank for it to ever be popular. The reagent vendor is also on a patrol, that covers half the city. It's just poorly designed really.
---
Is your GM Sonydigital?
---
No, not for pve your shouldn't be reliant on set piece procs
---
For BRD you should focus on jail or arena runs until you're at least 55+, those will take place in the early part of the dungeon.
---
In Dire Maul you would only do the east wing on lower levels, and even then that's probably 55+. Jump runs often mean not bringing a full party to maximize profits and they'd only take 60s.
---
If you're looking for something more simple, Leatrix Plus has an option to make the profession window larger too. Easier to find stuff. Skillet seems more nifty with a ton of functions though. You could also say more bloated.
---
do you not understand the term?

Saw a guild running around called "Lucrifron refugees" on my server.

Really happy ony Patchwerk and with the decision to switch.

Quests
---
I believe the quest starts from an item found in the bloodsail buccaneers pirate ships. Not sure which ship, it might be random.
---
Or maybe all of your guildmembers just became better at doing the bosses - you know, overall raid performance was better which meant you could do them in 2 hours. You really expect us to believe that your tanks speccing dw fury tanking made a 8 hour difference in your cleartimes?
---
It is in the game, the starter to the chain is in STV as mentioned.
---
I love large caves and I love castles so my favorite place in all of WoW has to be Ironforge, it's the closest thing to a cross-breed.
---
I assume you are talking about arcane missiles. Why are you comparing a spell that hits every second to spells that only hits after the full cast time?
---
There's also a hidden thing about Loyalty. The pet needs to earn XP (rough guess was 10% of a level) before it can level up it's loyalty. 
---
at least that was the theory
---
Are you seriously implying that you should not specc deep wounds on warrior? In that case you're no doubt the idiot in this scenario.
---
You won't do any significant damage at 58 since you will have a very high miss chance on bosses. So you'd only go if your guild really likes you, otherwise you better grind out that 60.
---
Actually it's way better and cleaner if you just ditch the WL and go with 3 mages. 
---
Just pull everything and block. Clean blizzard clean Nova's and the pulls are way more calculated and quicker. No one needs a warlock if you can have a mage.

---
Why do you believe prices will only increase? Layer removal provides us both new competition and costumers. 
---
Well, expect me because thier always been too much competition for tribal leather workers
---
I‚Äôm not really an expert on warriors but I believe total weapon damage on the 2 hand/main-hand 1h is more important than the dps as abilities are calculated with that damage and are not normalized with weapon speed. If you were just auto attacking with a higher dps weapon but using abilities makes the higher damage/slower weapon more ideal. 
---
Again I don‚Äôt play warrior but shield is probably only relevant in dungeons as a tank beginning in the mid 40s or lower if you have a group with low dps/bad healer.
---
IIRC layering was always off in capital cities.

Horde is better PVE when your goal is to kill it as fast as possible. It just took a long long time for people to come up with how that worked. People were always trying to get the tank to be as "tanky" as possible which threat capped horde (alliance has bless of salv) especially since horde had windfury for melee dps. The answer isn't "how do i keep the tank alive for 8 minutes?" Its "how does the tank do more threat than the 13 dps warriors while spam healed for 2 minutes?" The answer is fury-prot warrior or bear with mcp generating so much threat that the windfury procc'ing fury warriors can't pull aggro. Fear ward isn't really needed period and frankly if you're in a fight that fears more than once how the hell are you going to fear ward more than than the tank and a few healers the second time? Tremor totem works on five people at a time for a single gcd.

The little hut in winterspring off the main road. My fondest memory was when I first started playing wow, me and my girlfirned at the time used to go there and chill. Since then I have always referred to it as my wow home and visit it from time to time for nostalgia.

Nooope
---
&gt; At what point does the shield become a factor?
---
During leveling - never. Shield is only for tanking in party.  
---
&gt;Leveling as a warrior, should I always be using the highest dps weapon available?  
---
Yes, and since 2H are always have higher DPS - you should be leveling with 2H.
---
&gt;Belt is a pretty solid upgrade over what you can get.

i dont know man, i had a very different experience...up to the part where it ruined my fun of the game. 
---
i got 3 characters level 40 parked at SW or BB, doing nothing...
---
i guess my tolerance level was much higher back in vanilla.
---
That's a bit antagonistic. Especially since I wasn't even in the fight
---
Lashers + Herbing, and it's fun cuz it's kind of RNG with the loot you get so it's always sort of exciting.
---
Also loot all the Runn tum tuber sprouts. A little tip, you can just get close to them, if they're lootable they wont trigger any traps. I've tried to approach them carefully one time too many before actually testing this method.
---
Yeah that's why the little landing outside the front door was always the place to be for duelists.
---
There has been a mass exodus of alliance on skeram, I think you're confused. Hell there's horde that transferred off as well who have begged others to transfer as well.
---
Skeram hasn't thinned out because in any meaningful way because of people quitting wow. Countless people because sick of ques and didn't know or want to use remote desktop.
---
If you think all the actual casual players of this game sat around in a que in the beginning weeks opposed to rerolling you're sadly confused.
---
I mean... 
---
He's asking for lower populations because busyness is affecting his enjoyment.
---
Wrong. Layer is global.. what you're thinking is called sharding and we don't have that in classic wow thank God.
---
It's full like that because yesterday was prime raid day because of reset and people were waiting for onyxia head buff
---
I would dungeon as much as possible. Or group quest. 
---
I guess that would also depend on spec. If you go heals it‚Äôll be faster with others than solo.
---
Mix of both, I've been gathering all the quests for the appropriate level dungeon in that area.  Try get them all done in one run, hand in &amp; move on.
---
If you need a specific item from a dungeon, farm the hell out of it and get the exp at the same time.  Thinking along the lines of HOJ, you can start farming that at 55-56 or even the ring from Mara, 47-48 I think
---
Why are this guys running a fury tank?
---
And why no FR on Ragnaros, he'll just get knocked back and kill the melee...
---
It's very subjective. As a priest you'll easily find dungeon groups as a healer, especially if you make friends with a tank. If you go shadow questing is viable too. Just do what you find fun!
---
For warriors its 20 Agi for 1%crit/dodge. That 0,75% on this ring plus a 1% crit.
---
For dps pretty nice. For Tanks it leaks stamina.
---
Top of the elevator entering thousand needles
---
Alright, I take that back, a lot.
---
It was better in P1 though.
---
Should be mage, pretty self-reliant and good cc.
---
But one global is still shorter then a full shadow bolt cast time. So it is a dps increase.

Home is where the Hearth is, right? I love UD Strat and Scholo for dungeons, I love Un'goro Crater for zones, but specific spot: has to be Gurubashi Arena baby!
---
Agreed. I was ninjad by a guild group on the felcloth glove pattern, after they stole it they said ‚Äúsucks to be you‚Äù then kicked me from the group. I reported them and made a ticket about it, blizzard won‚Äôt give me the pattern and ‚Äúwon‚Äôt discuss ongoing investigations or disciplinary actions taken‚Äù but the priest who stole the pattern hasn‚Äôt been on for over a week now, at least not when I‚Äôve searched for him with /who which is several times a day, so I‚Äôm confident that bliss actually did something about that
---
I don't think it can. No addon can view more than 50 items in the mailbox.
---
NO!
---
Mulgore. Just a gorgeous place to level in.
---
letting dps tell you what to do instead of making your own group as a tank :thinking:
---
Print Screen ?
---
As a healer your spells don't miss your raid members, that's the reason a healer can be lower level than the content calls for as long as you can sustain your mana somehow. As a DPS your attacks (or spells) have increased chance to miss due to the level discrepancy between you and mobs / bosses. No matter how skilled you are, you will be performing much worse than if you were 60.
---
I've never played a mage but common sense and using a few brain cells would tell you getting spammed constantly by beggars or people tipping may get annoying. That being said... WTB Food and LVL 55 mage water. 40/80 pst
---
Yeah, its pretty much garbage. Funny to have 8/8 setbonus in VAEL fight. +27% crit to PoH makes topping your own group super simple.
---
Lol, Druid healers being amazing, now that‚Äôs a funny joke

Pro-tip: 99% of hunters will notice if their pet is underleveled for the content because it will die instantly and deal no damage.

Shadowpanther. Net
---
A lot of people at this moment dont know how much something could be worth. I have Auctioneer but if nobody auctioned it yet I dont know how much something is worth. So if I see that its an upgrade for me and if I see that it wasnt auctioned yet, I will most likely just use it.
---
A slow mainhand is better because it wont eat up flurry stacks as much.
---
But for hooman you should go for vis'karg and not for deathbringer
---
I tap a lot &amp; would never drink while the melee are dealing with the next pack (would recover while OOC though) - basically if a mob is in combat, it's getting shadowbolted to the face. Naturally, precautions must be taken to ensure I'm getting healed &amp; therefore top on the meters so that the lesser DPS classes can be awed and regret not rolling a warlock. And if there's another warlock, I must ensure I'm getting healed more to prove my supremacy over him/her.
---
I always carry a stack of Sagefish Delight (the mp5 food), but never use them. At the start of the dungeon, I would trade the healer like 4-5 fishes. Works like a charm. And it's pretty cheap too :)
---
4can I have your stereo?
---
the first MC or 2 which were nearly 1/2 pug were simply run as /roll MS&gt;OS 2 items per person 1 BOP, 1 BOE. No restrictions on anything else
---
the core of the guild all played vanilla at a high level and fully understand the chances of getting both bindings to drop and decided to not worry about it for the first few runs. and FWIW we have a binding from Geddon, and we never expect to finish it
---
I still remember my rogue getting MCed and me finding out the hard way 'Wait, this guy can do that?!'
---
Thankfully priest dispelled it right quick. BFD has a lot of these cultists who can also apparently mind control.
---
Horde scum deserve to be purged.
---
Indeed it is
---
Seems weird to me that keeping dots on the boss makes or breaks your raiding experience.
---
I'm kinda a noob can someone explain to me what this layering thing is?
---
Something you might want to do, as I feel you're not trying to min-max... is to do a mixed build. Deep Combat is best for Raids (at least until later raids), whilst deep Subtlety is best for PvP. So throw some points into both, and carry 2 sets of weapons. Play like Combat in Dungeons and Raids, play whatever you want in the open world, and play like Subtlety in PvP. You can even make macros to quickly swap your weapons (though swapping weapons puts you on a Global Cooldown).
---
You won't be the best at either of course (likely low, to middle-of-the-pack for Raids, and you'd miss Preparation most from Subtlety), but it'll give you more diversity and frees you from respecs. Engineering can help deal with shortcomings (and for a Rogue, I'm personally a fan of also grabbing Herbalism so you can get your own herbs for Thistle Tea, and make money on the other herbs you sell).
---
If you don't want to raid though, just keep doing what you are. Your damage will suffice for dungeons. :)
---
Or you do Arena Only and get a shaman healer or druid healer or even off spec healer and it's just as good
---
lol nice
---
Wrong. I often had to invite people to trade with them in org. I also had to get someone to invite me to kill alliance scum that was trying to kill Sylvanas. (suddenly went from 0 alliance in the throne room to about 2 raid groups after getting an invite)
---
I see someone didn‚Äôt read the blue post.
---
I mean he's not gonna boost non-guildies for cheap, but I'm on Ashbringer EU.
---
i remember they cost 20euro per character...so screw blizzard and their server transfers.  
---
20euro to copy a folder to a different server, is way too much. especially when we pay a monthly fee.
---
Warrior isn't a good example, because warrior (especially on horde) is the best damage (with best scaling by items) in classic. So bringing more warriors isn't really "diminishing" returns on sunder armor, because then they can all use less global cooldowns on sunder upkeep and more gcd on being the best dps mathematically.
---
Did you do the quests in Shimmering Flats yet?
---
My favorite place in Azeroth, is a cave somewhere on the southern coast of Kalimdor.. back in vanilla, my leveling buddy was MIA and I decided to take a swim around both continents while waiting. Somewhere south of kalimdor, there is a massive cave system, and as I was exploring it I had a feeling that any minute I would be molested by a dragon, an eerie feeling all around.
---
For years I took friends down there and tried to scare them.

Dont mind going for the belt, but I skip golem. Nit sure what this has to do with dumb as fuck melee dps.

How do you motivate healers to join, then?

Seems to be that way, thanks.
---
I lost mana igniting cord with a 99 last night. Then it dropped the next boss and I lost it again. Rip
---
its not needed for something else, but that off-hand you get from the quest, is one of the best you can get as a warlock.
---
In my Guild im the Warlock who can craft Robe of the Winter Night, who dies all the time and has the most DKP because I have not yet bid on a single item in MC because I lost like 5 rolls on the Mageblade so far.

I dropped the tailoring after getting the robe and kept the gathering profession (mining) along with engineering. Having mining or herb decently increases gold income from DM/Mara farming.     
---
I think there is no other BoP tailoring craft that would require you to keep tailoring for, so you can get the stuff you want crafted by somebody else.
---
&gt;on par with or slightly above feral druids
---
Not really. Tryhard feral druid (like Shedo) in current gear can comfortably beat any caster (including mage) and compete with rogues and warriors. Has to tryhard with consumables and has the most complex rotation in the game, though.
---
Yeah more hit is always good.
---
I dont see priest doing any good aoe farm, specially not with holynova - not enough dmg for a huge manacost. Mages just do that better.
---
Maybe something with a "reflect dmg" setup to kill lowlevel monster just by surviving. TrollPriests Shadowguard has good spelldmg scaling, 33% for each ball. 
---
Else its mostly faster/better dmg for farm with mindcontrol. Control a caster humanoid and nuke their friends. The leftover oom caster is a easy kill too. No loot if they die in mindcontrol.
---
TyrsHand has good Caster, or maybe DireMaul Ogre Warlocks. 
---
Everything else priest dmg is pretty shitty. Good shadowdmg gear drops with bwl.
---
This is amazing.  If there is one feature of retail wow I would add to Classic it's the group finder (NOT the automatic match-making LFG)
---
If you need roll need.  The way it‚Äôs always been.    Anyone who bitches is wrong.
---
I always pay 50 silvers for any amount of water, just cause mage did some clicks for me.

why did you link the video at the last couple of seconds?

---
Isn‚Äôt that the dragon slayer buff?
---
FFS, why is the website so weird? 
---
OK, I get it that you need me to disable adblock. But when I do disable adblock for your site it still keeps spamming "pls disable adblock".
---
Am I the only one having this issue? Using uBlock origin.

Not sure what that has to do with wow classic.

They popped Onyxia buff

Damn, that sucks to hear. Maybe has something to do with me playing a tauren, seems like many alliance players are more friendly toward us. Sadly, racism in wow is rampant. #gnomelivesmatter

Cant blame you for not knowing Pilavs content, but the dude makes plenty of sarcastic and overall in your face humor. Also his initial bashing was made towards people who got famous just for playing classic and milking its content dry with bland guides on a 15 year old game that has evolved(for better or worse) mechanically. Say what you will about him, but those initial points he made about bland streamers and shit people like Tips Out becoming popular due to guides you could learn yourself by playing the game does not apply to him.
---
I was prot untill 42, works fine pulling 2-3 mobs at a time with 1h shield, use wisdom/light seal and SoR, you wont have to rest between mobs.
---
Using a 2hander is still faster even if ur prot at this level tho. Once you get holy shield you can pull a lot more and 1h shield will be faster than 2h I bet.
---
You really shouldnt need to rest much between mobs but the time to kill aint the fastest either
---
&gt;before someone who's going to still be significantly behind the top tier dps
---
Of course they'll be sugnificantly behind - they're undergeared!

You hunters need to stop spreading propaganda. You are still the huntards.

Same, transferred to Heartstriker now.

If I ever need a definition of an "ironic comment" I'll use this one, thanks.
---
Only in ZG.
---
Absolutely, they are a suicide black deck in its truest form.
---
Never had a problem. I take mostly healers still going for Ban'thok Slash. Still what's this got to do with people being braid dead and leaving over stupid shit like not having a tank 30 seconds into looking for a group.

I‚Äôd be up for helping out!

Wait for p2 to start, there will be plenty of fun in world PVP. Also check the dueling tournament, despite it's flaws it pretty fun to watch (and you learn a trick or two for pvp).
---
AFAIK nothing changed on EU side this night. You can always visit the official realm status and see for yourself. Those labelled new there appear as layered in your client:
---
[https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/game/status/classic-eu](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/game/status/classic-eu)
---
Mageblade is better anyways :)
---
Looks great
---
Stormwind. Love interacting with many different types of players. It's my favourite city to chill in!
---
Why do you feel that a few people speak for a whole community?
---
Mage job is pretend to do damage and not take gear from warrior, lol.
---
Looks like you need the /s, if you can't tell the comment above was a joke too.
---
yeah, but what I mean is that is just going  from extremely low chance to very low chance..  still not really viable to 'farm' them
---
People have this unfound obsession with plate wearers with a shield or a bear tanking. As much as this is the case in raids, dungeons are a completely different set.
---
I'd argue most of the time it's better to have 4 dps and a healer in a dungeon. most trash can be kited and cc'ed, meaning you completely negate enemy damage while getting more dps because you have 4 instead of 3.
---
Even bosses die so fast, that a rogue evasion or a defensive cd is good enough to survive until the boss dies. Or a hunter kiting with the taunt shot for example.
---
Bottom line, tanks in dungeons are not mandatory. And not even nearly as valuable as people give them credit.
---
I'm on the "Dreadsteed of Xoroth" part. Is it safe to trow away "Mor'zul's Instructions" even before I do this part, for bag space reasons?
---
Did you mean to say divinities?
---
hahahahh "4 months from now"? first it was game will die in 1 week after launch, then 1 month, then 2 months, now 4 whats next? "real test is how classic looks in 250 years or what?
---
Just lashers. Nova doesn't do enough damage on a full mana bar to kill regular level ~55+ mobs.
---
Everywhere I went yesterday looked like this. Undercity, Thunder Bluff, Orgrimmar, Kargath, Everlook, and Gadgetzan. It was mind blowing.
---
I grind Satyrs in Felwood, Ogres in Deadwind Pass, and the Timbermaw rep dudes in Winterspring, and so far I have gotten a pumpkin bag off of each on my priest!
---
Ah, so that explains why IF seemed much more crowded than usual yesterday on Kromcrush.
---
Desolace
---
Np, I'm sure there are plenty of dps guides for rogues on Youtube by now if you want to min max your dmg.
---
The cave at Marshals refuge
---
My buddy made 60g an hour yesterday slinging waters.
---
We even started a pyramid scheme where the lowbies in our guild would sling his water in various different cities and throw him 20% profit.
---
As others said, the +hit beyond 9% still affects white hits. But it's not entirely clear how much the +hit is worth at this point - some information claims that you should still get as much hit as you can, and others say that beyond 9% crit chance and attack power is much more valuable than hit.
---
I'm a shaman who will be jumping between all specs. Which fordring quest reward am I best off picking? I'm leaning towards the crit neck piece for Enh because I believe it's easier to find SP/HP ring substitutes.
---
I'm using Twitch to install/update my wow classic addons.
---
However, it seems it sometimes can't differenciate an update for retail vs classic.
---
For example, I've Bartender4-4.8.8-classic and it offers me to update to Bartender4-4.8.8
---
Is there any way to fix this?
---
Same for ZPerl, Pawn, Auctioneer
---
General rule I use in all dungeons.  Need if you Need, Greed if you dont.  Everyone roll Need on epic boes or bags.
---
The best would be to need and then make people who greed /rand so that you're sure you don't get ninjaed
---
Me because I'd just sell the mats you idiot
---
Not much in terms of spellpower plate gear before BRD.
---
Because of how classic works, sometimes forming a group and then travel times to the dungeons can take some time, telling someone to level mainly through instances isn't a great idea. By all means join the LFG channel but quest or grind while trying to form or join a group, if you only stay in a city while waiting for instance groups you will waste a ton of time.
---
Honestly just wish theyd merge herod with heartseeker lol, thatd be like a solid 50/50 split but way too high a pop
---
Warsong (soon ‚Ñ¢) so I can revenge all those ganking sessions while leveling in STV
---
It took about 30 seconds to open each mail I had from the AH, and I had 3 relogs worth. It was... painful.
---
Just hit 60 on my Enh shaman. I'm thinking of respecing to Resto for pve until phase 2. Is Enh or Ele viable in phase 1(pve-wise since there is no honour system)?
---
Way to miss the point. OP is stating that if the item is an upgrade to you, you should be able to need it. If you‚Äôre just wanting to sell it for gold, then you‚Äôre ninjaing if you need it.
---
My favorite zone is thousand needles, i love how diferent it is from every other biome in world of warcraft, the towering mesas that then open up to the salt flats. Great design.
---
No healer with self respect and one functioning brainhalf will use a spell with spell hit if there's a spellcaster on the group.
---
There's a sp/heal ring from arena and some neat boots from golem.
---
If your comment is so vague and ambiguous that you need a /s to avoid misunderstanding, you should keep it to yourself
---
And its not even that good.. Boots of avoidance as fury? What are you doing with your life.. not even cloudkeeper legs
---
Feralas. It's just such a beautiful zone. I wish it had more quests
---
I had an alliance mage sheep me after I had a near death experience fighting more mobs than I could handle. At first I was pissed until I saw my
---
HP after coming out of it
---
After some basic testing, it didn‚Äôt seem to.
---
Ninja looting is bannable though.
---
idk, I was considering whether this was a viable method to farm gold as feral.   I think I can make more than 25 gold per hour farming demons.
---
My favorite area is redridge. I have fond memories of beating low lvl allies to death with my fishing pole.
---
What chart?
---
Never understood why healers would go for it. Only priests can really use it, and shadow gets a metric ton of hit in talents already. But main thing is if you have a caster dps (which you should if you want a chance to win that HOJ), they'd be very upset if a healer wins their belt.
---
Darnassus because I‚Äôve travelled there as lvl16 Orc Hunter to tame my Owl and it was amazing adventure
---
I don't play classic at all but you seem really unhealthily obsessed with circlejerking. Speaking of circlejerking, the only circlejerking I've seen so far is circlejerkers circlejerking about classic being a failure and calling people who love the game circlejerkers, you circlejerking circlejerker.
---
Fine. Okay. I get it. We need layers üòÇ
---
we already knew that...  He admitted that a long time ago on another channel.  He started in cata.
---
Wait, are you sarcastic or serious? I can't tell. ^PS. don't feed the troll
---
There must be an bots as I get outbid so quickly when I try to snipe short duration items
---
Sunken Temple
---
Sunken temple, it's just something about the vibes!
---
Aye I'm still not arguing against it's possible to flip things if you know the real value. My initial point, and what I'm still saying, is simply that the price the addon lists is likely not something I would even remotely trust as being that "real value" when it comes to such limited items. 
---
And you clearly don't believe in the price yourself, otherwise it would be silly to sell something for 130-160 if it was actually selling for 250g.
---
I laughed at this for a solid ten minutes. Thanks
---
So if I vendor a 5g weapon, then use item restore, do I lose the 5g I got from vendor?
---
Asking for a friend.
---
Hope u guys are right \^\^
---
On P server i COD the wrong person and I never got that stuff back, even after 30+ days.
---
Maybe get consent before starting a dungeon.
---
Doesn't the alliance buff come from SW?
---
Wow it really does, look at that ui
---
 Ashenvale. I just find it impressive that the original dev team actually made me feel like i'm in a forest. Feralas is not that far behind for the same reason.
---
So fuxking wrong. Graphic updates can be turned off to classic (default) but they ported it so people who wanted to play with better graphics could (aka anyone who isn't playing pnly for nostalgi). The flight button was also added to the game because it was a stupid waste of time if yoj clicked the wrong flight path. It would also mean that anyone stuck on a long flight path wouldn't get invited to groups or if you missclicked you'd end up kicked today.
---
Some people have no idea whats good and bad for them..
---
Enh usually has 1-2 spots in raids due to imp. WF and SoE totems and does OK in dungeons - although can cause aggro issues if get lucky with WF and don't hold off ES. 
---
Ele does nice damage in 5m, but goes OOM pretty quickly on longer fights which makes raid encounters problematic. Some MC stuff is also immune to Nature dmg iirc, which is a huge issue. Resto does well regardless of what grouped PvE content you're doing.
---
They can dog it as much as they like, the community loves spamming it and it has become a cult of sorts, where if you dont "spellcleave" you're not one of the cool dudes.
---
Bartender4 is best
---
Maybe you should check out the front page of this subreddit all the time then?
---
NO CHANGES
---
This should be posted on the retail sub, we already know how this games plays ad are happy with it :)
---
Tamaris. Something about the desert is so pretty and soothing
---
Thats why I refer to it as it "spellcleave" all the time.
---
Why? Had that happen in Uldaman too and it was stated before hand everyone need. We let the guy who greeded /roll and he won. I had it so I traded it to him fair and square.
---
Winterspring
---
To all claiming that this was not vanilla-like, this should only affect bosses or packs that are actually "linked", which are only very few specific packs in the game.
---
If you try to pull a single murlocs out of a pack of 5 and get attacked by all its not because those 5 were linked, they arent. Its because every time a mob gets engaged into combat, it will also engage every other very close nearby mob of the same mobtype to attack as well. In those cases, it should still be possible to reset some of those mobs.
---
&gt;and warlocks still do more damage
---
Spriest has 10% hit chance from talents. It\`s HUGE for phases 1-3, where spellhit gear is so hard to get.
---
You have to be lucky with getting a decent guild though. The ones I've joined have all been quiet ghosttowns even with 30-60 people online. No interest in running dungeons either the few times I've asked.
---
That along with my friends no longer wanting to play has made me quit too.
---
Mulgore
---
That makes a lot of sense.
---
Damn, love suf but healcomm might be too important to live without
---
Mirage Raceway
---
I also got a feeling that Classic is actually full of family people. And I would definitely make the same joke and my wife wouldnt take it in a bad way.
---
IMO this is true for blue BOE‚Äôs, not epics. Epics at a lower lvl are so nisched and will pretty soon be replaced. Its better for a lucky person in the Party to get a little gold boost if he manages to sell the item.
---
Strange. I haven't been able to switch layers in the last week at peak times so I assumed it was turned off for Shazzrah as well.
---
People in this game don't like to be ordered a lot, especially mages. So they're all highly encouraged to do certain things.
---
Ah okay I understand. Reserving is fair as long as they follow YOUR reserve rules. Cool, makes sense.
---
Imagine being proud of being scum.
---
Upvoted for visibility. Thanks for the tip!
---
I lost on BRE with a 97 last raid day man I know the feels.
---
You‚Äôd go for BoW over blessing of sanctuary?
---
You won't be replacing the healing ring until MC at the earliest. It and Rosewine circle from LBRS are pre-BiS for healing. Can't comment on the neck.
---
I grind elementary in NW Silithus, XP is not bad, it's good for your Hydraxian reputation and they drop essences.
---
BoE Epic, I need regardless as it's profit for everyone. You want that Bow epic, you buy it or hope you did.
---
Loot reserves - don't join their group, make your own.
---
More commonly associated with Danish, but Danish // Norwegian are very similar.
---
The healing ring is pre-bis though, it's really strong and resto shamans are pretty sought after at this point.
---
I can't speak for your server but that's certainly not the case for mine. Obviously there has been some drop off, but nowhere near what even I expected. From my personal experience the game still feels (almost) as popular as the first week of launch. I did have a friend that decided to reroll from a PvE server to a PVP server, as he and a lot of his friends later regretted rolling on that server type.
---
Zandalar get ganked by Angry RPing Russians.
---

---
&gt; Hell they even let you add enemy faction players as battle net friends and chat with them in-game.

How does that work? How would you find out the other account name?

I'm no expert but possibly because there are millions of players all entering blizz servers, even if there are only a few thousand on each server.

can diremaul tribute buffs be gotten in a raid ? guild is going for MC and wondering if it's possible to zerg down diremaul basically
---
Decided to check out Luna Unit Frames and really like them so far. This elite border addon doesn‚Äôt work for them though. 
---
I might dig into the code later to see if there is an easy enough way to update it to work. 
---
Btw, to others that like SUF, Luna might be worth a look. Have to manually install from their git repo. 
---
https://github.com/Aviana/LunaUnitFrames/releases 
---
Some things Luna has over SUF:
---
-	cast bars for all units 
---
-	pretty nice defaults and similar look to SUF
---
-	works with Heal Comm 
---
-	and I‚Äôm sure many more things but I haven‚Äôt played with it yet.
---
A lot of options, but I got to say Westfall. It's bright and cheery, it's got a great chain buildup to one of the most iconic mini-bosses, and it feels like a real zone people would live in. 
---
I love old Blanchy!
---
Nuke it. That's gross.
---
I just rightclick their name and it has "add friend" option. Some people don't have that option, not sure if it's anything to do with addons or what.

---
I dont even care about Princess runs. I'd rather run the endgame dungeons for valuable random drops and endgame mats than get that couple of dps upgrade from the ring. Not worth it imo.
---
Usually it doesn't start on it's own. People who were camped in those zones while leveling are coming back at 60 to return the favor. Thats how PVP servers work.
---
maybe I wouldnt mind but this is how I currently look at it :  
---
I spent so much time learning all of these spells and my rotations. Then I would reach lvl 60 and start only spamming 1 spell that I basically dont even use right now? I know that locks bring other things to the table but I just feel like it wouldnt be that fun.   
---
but tbh I also have no time to raid so this is  completely irrelevant :D
---
just bought 2 of them for 30g each from some hunter soloing the thing
---
in the time it would have taken to grind for the ring i could easily make 100g or more
---
No it‚Äôs not. Escape artist solves a lot more problems for rogues/warriors than Wotf ever will. Rogues breaks fear with trinket anyway. 
---
Hardiness is broken, wotf is just a good racial which is on par with stone form and EA.
---
Uh, no? I wouldn't spend 10g on the pants out of WC but i sure as hell will run WC from 18-22 so i can get them. Of course that same amount of time on my level 60 characters is worth like 200 gold... so tell me again why it matters how much somebody else might pay for any given item? whether or not its boe or bop isn't relevant to me wanting to get it by playing the game and not paying the game.
---
Wow okay I guess my Monday night runs I was just really really lucky on then. It can't last forever I guess...
---
*prays to RNGesus*
---
Thanks for assuring my paranoia fellow jump miners! &lt;3
---
I like how the conversation ends here.
---
Check out Luna Unit Frames. 
---
It‚Äôs a very similar to SUF but has some great enhancements.
---
As a level 57 Warlock, is there anywhere in Dire Maul East that I can farm gold / XP simultaneously on the way to 60? I want to try and preserve some quests in higher level zones for the higher gold return at 60.
---
this bis list becomes wild on some slot for phase 2. Idk wtf they think.
---
When people say they like PvP servers, often means they like to gank lowbies of the opposite faction, repeatedly.
---
I would not mind PvP servers if there was some sort of level limit to which you can attack. E.g. 60 can attack 55+, 40s can attack 35+ etc. Not lvl 40+ vs lvl 15
---
This addon is awesome, thanks so much!
---
Westfall! Even though I‚Äôve quested through all of the zone probably 20-30 times over the years it still keeps a special place in my heart. I think it‚Äôs well designed and planned in most aspects and when you enter it for the first time on a character it feels like the game has finally ‚Äùstarted‚Äù. Also Deadmines is still one of the best instances.
---
Im not a caster so I cant really speak to it, I have seen it drop once and the guy was ecstatic that he got it. I really REALLY dont care about rolling competition. I dont care if I see that trinket drop 7 times before I get it. And I tend to play with like minded people. With that being said on live I grinded over 40+ mythics before I saw sword upgrade for my DH. I have patience and when I finally do win it it will be all that much sweeter.
---
Russians? Russians more like mages giving out vodka but seriously I've never met anyone not speaking English
---
There is an empty camp in the southeast of Desolace. It's where I did the final logout of my Warlock during the end of TBC. It's a nice and eerie place, and it has demons nearby, so I thought it's a good fit.
---
Feralas, love almost all green forest zones but the dark atmosphere of Feralas really pushes it over.
---
Oh I will. Just haven't really had it happen yet. So far boomies and ret pallies I've taken haven't done much but make my groups/raids worse. I know they are viable but they aren't if they don't put in the work. My main rogue is SoF before it's deemed usable and I'm leveling a boomy right now, so I recognize the specs having potential.
---
The biggest one for me is the rolling plains of Durotar. Especially right outside the entrance Orgrimmar. So many duels.
---
Depends what you are expecting. I have similar time restrictions, maybe a bit more, but retail just doesn't do it for me. In the end it depends on what you want, in retail you should be able to accomplish more in a less time, but everything in Classic feels more rewarding once I get it eventually done. In retail you can get decent gear just by doing quests and 5-mans, but newer content and titanforging makes it constantly drop in relative value. That can be a good thing if you enjoy constantly getting a better gear, but it's also not as rewarding as getting a BiS item in classic that will last you for months, maybe even half a year depending on how fast they want to release new phases.
---
Yeah, this is key here, I don't think that at the MC/Ony gear level that the DPS are missing out on a lot because of threat.
---
I think this can become an issue in future tiers, but MC is a a total joke to be honest, if not for the complexity of herding 40 people, it would be easier than most 5-mans.
---
&gt;During leveling - never. Shield is only for tanking in party
---
This depends on your gear. I'm now at level 42, with WW axe as my 2h and the quest reward sword from SM and Aegis as my sword and board, and even with axe spec talents the difference in XP/hour while grinding is minimal.
---
&gt;People roll need on big ticket BOE items because other people aren‚Äôt trustworthy.
---
No, people say other people aren't trustworthy so that they can roll on big ticket BoE items.
---
You want free food and water should of rolled a mage
---
But didn't the enchanter fuck it up?
---
Hurr durr i Pick a class thats vital for group Play (or any Play as a Mama User) but doing what i signed up for? Nah man i rather be afk in If doing jack Shit. Play Singleplayer Games, okay?

GROB MOB WE IN THIS BICC
---
I managed a guild in TBC. It was small, focused on progression to start out. I had a good raid leader, and a few good officers. We had a legit, easy-going recruiting process, and new members usually stuck around - until we had problems with people being people. Then, like most small guilds, it began to fall apart, and I abandoned the server just to get some peace from the drama.
---
So unless you are good with people, can be firm, fair and friendly, able to recruit a solid raid leader and provide constant attention to your entire list of 100+ guild members, don't do it.
---
But if you can do all those things and still enjoy the game, have at it!
---
Most likely answer : the naysayers where a relatively small amount of trolls that exploited the fact that so many hardcore vanilla fans are easily triggered / offended, now that classic is out the trolls have moved on to different targets  "most likely BFA players"
---
What would you say are the biggest expenses in Phase 2?
---
ahh ok that makes sense
---
I avoided it in Vanilla, but now that I'm back in classic, Hillsbrad Foothills has really been a fun experience.
---
Actually, dynamic respawns existed in Vanilla. https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/dynamic-respawns/245750/71

Screen picture
---
Kromcrush was definitely reduced to single layer yesterday as well. IF was MOBBED. It caught me off guard.
---
When it first came out i I was a couple of levels behind and they gave me such a hard time about it. Now they are all 30 lvls behind and I can't even give them a hard time. One friend went tailoring so we all funneled out cloth to him. He was making mageweave bgs and i hadnt seen him on for two days. He logs on and bitched he only had a couple of stacks of mageweave. Told him im not going to funnel him 10g in stuff two weeks into the game if hes not on. Said it was absurd to take him being gone for 2 days as him getting out. He logged off ten minutes later. Logged in 3 days later for 30 minutes and hasn't been on since.
---
&gt; how time consuming
---
It's a re-released 15 year old game. It's likely not going anywhere/progressing for a long time. You'v got plenty of time.
---
Based on this, I don't think so.
---
&gt; And now, if you aggro one of a group of creatures in any zone, and then you keep occasionally hitting any one of them, the whole group will follow you across the zone.
---
Sounds like any mobs anywhere.
---
until you have to quest and fight for mobs

This is my favorite part of classic besides the server communities. It‚Äôs also why I chose to main a hunter‚Äî1) because I‚Äôve always enjoyed breaking the ‚Äúhuntard‚Äù stereotype, just like I did back in true Classic and 2) because I enjoy being known as a player that can help clutch a fight for the raid, be it tranq shot on Magmadar or kiting Drakk in UBRS‚Äîor feign death + cables for wipe protection.

Dynamic respawns existed in Vanilla. A bug during the Beta prevented it and was fixed prior to launch. https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/dynamic-respawns/245750/71

That's surprising I rolled on a EU server in original vanilla and there was a lot of Russians.

Nope since the herbs you farm have a value and you can sell them. If this isn't profitable to buy mats and craft then you are better off selling the mats your farmed.

This isn‚Äôt pservers. The inferno‚Äôs later ticks deal 5k+ damage each. You aren‚Äôt healing through.

Stranglethorn, always loved fishing there!

#nochanges bullshit my ass
---
Played with this guy last night healing LBRS, really good tank and was a pleasure to team with!
---
Did someone say dispel magic/purge? That windfury buff ain't going anywhere though.
---
I just love one shotting people with an auto attack though so I'm a little biased.
---
Haven't levelled fishing or cooking at all. Is it possible to level cooking solely via fish?

Blackrock moutain,

running on those giant chains to go down and reach the lower levels without being toasted in lava, even before entering BRD or Molten Core the place is really epic!

I do when i play a game thats based on teamplay

My favorite zone is Classic WoW is **Redridge Mountains**. I like it because it is almost a microcosm of the WoW experience. It starts off with simple quests like getting a little girl's necklace from the bottom of thr lake, to heroically taking back a Human fortification from an Orc army. Plus, I love the autumn aesthetic.
---
Yo what ui is that?
---
So far it's gotta be silverpine / ashenvale. Just love the rainy forest and the mysteriousness of it all. 
---
Also herbs

I've tried my hand at multiboxing, it's not as easy as everyone railing against it seems to think.  Sure you could run a bunch of the same class and that simplifies things to a certain degree, but if you see someone rolling around playing a bunch of different classes and controlling it well, then you know they put *a lot* of time into setting that up to be able to do it.
---
I tried up to 5 characters, but gave up pretty quickly when I realized how much effort playing multiple different classes was.  I don't want to just play 5 shaman or 5 mages or whatever, that doesn't appeal to me.
---
Netherwind is very balanced too, might be 55/45 ally/horde
---
I have seen this happen where the quest completes, but the window stays open. But only when running an auto quest turn in mod. (I use TurnIn on retail and EzQuest on classic)
---
Undercity! It's a mix of dark, filthy but cozy and warm... Crazy Home feelings! haha

That would clearly show op that the return date is 3 days and ruin his scam. So he either thought of that or just got lucky in that regard.

Karazhan - Deadwind Pass, I go and wonder about the mysteries and wonders hidden behind that door.
---
A tangentially related question--let's say that I'm a mage and the Robe of the Archmage Pattern drops (the pattern is effectively BoE but the produced item is BoP). Should I roll 'need' since it is BiS until phase 3 or should I roll greed because I could have simply bought it from the AH if I wanted it?
---
5% parry 2-10% armor +10 def
---
Thanks :D
---
Pure speculation. It is atill likely true that Classic has more players than retail. There will never be a statement from Blizzard about this. Just like there will never be an official statement that Blizzard also kowtows to the PRC, but doesn't make it any less true.
---
Most sport analysts aren't ~~NK~~ TipsOut
---
Personally I use exactly that setup, with alt left and right click for downranked flash of light and holy light. I downrank flash of light to lv1 and holy light to 2 levels lower.
---
To be honest I only use downranking when we've got a tank who absolutely has all the threat and my downranks can keep up. They're the most efficient mana-wise but if I can't keep up I switch to using mostly the highest level flash of light. 
---
I only use Holy Light downranked to top off a Mage or Warlock.
---
Why no jumpruns?
---
The feeling that I have to log on, not for dailies or falling behind, but because you want to play with your guild and people you met along the way.
---
If you equip it right away, roll need. Otherwise it's pure greed, aka roll greed.
---
Put your /dnd tag, and just ignore them without pretending anything such as being afk.
---
The same mentality that labeled an entire class as retard.
---
Yet every single good guild is using DW fury tank outside of &lt;Progress&gt;, last I checked.

If you turn off the screech ability does it still make the annoying screech sound while attacking?

I do them on the weekend when I can commit a few hours (like opening wkd of dm).
---

---
This isn't fixing an exploit to do with Solenar, it actually just makes him easier because now you can focus on his bugs without worrying about him resetting. The trouble is how this impacts pretty much everything else.
---
I don't buy items on the AH because I use my gold on gold sinks, ie repair, drink, skills, mount. I'm not to the point where I care what the "economy" is. 
---
But the other answer is, I kill shit and run dungeons so that items drop that I can equip. So I roll need on things that I will equip and use. If other people want to fuck up the english language and be evil saying "roll need because its worth a lot of gold to somebody else"  you know "I want a lot of gold" is called in one word? Greed.
---
Stranglethorn Vale - As it is vibrant with lots of nature. It's a large zone with some amazing views and scenes. There is always someone around somewhere, be it friend or foe. The land feels immersive and dangerous. You can really feel yourself taking refuge behind a tree, or enjoying the sea breeze on the beach. It's a land of beauty, with a touch of competition.
---
ok, ty for your answere. Yeah you need a lot of time at max lv in BFA. all this things you can/should do... and yeah, leveling need also a lot of time in classic. i hope i can stay interested into classic for a longer time. also want some pvp/arena but we dont know when they release next phase.... i also have to say im not that much interested unti leveling. i enjoy endgame/raiding/arena/bg's but all this raids in BFA need 3h+ per run and i dont have this time every week  :/
---
That was because gear and setup.  People knew what to do...  Their spec was inconsequential.
---
it took me like 6 days played time to get my rogue to 60 ... ik the feeling dude it was pain xD especially cuz it was my 3rd character and i was behind the wave.
---
23 times in scarlet monastery amd Ravager didnt drop... What is the chance of this?
---
Yeah I get it man. I'm always down to help out the healers its normally the tank that will huff and puff.
---
That sucks man, and an all round dick move on their part.
---
As someone who enjoys classic and still plays, I wish the legacy community would stop pretending that thier is a massive about of mutual hatred between vanilla and current wow fan bases. Your desire if not need to be victimized is just disturbing
---
Has anyone tried it with Doomguard?
---
Everyone knows that the best horns have smoke coming out of them :)
---
Winterspring.  Most of my characters hit 60 here so I always get that ‚ÄúThe end is in sight‚Äù feeling when I first zone in.
---
If you wanna do a lot of dungeons tank them, you will get instant groups, etc.. You can take all the gear the healer doesn't need.
---
I'm with you, this should be standard for casual guilds, however if you're in for fast/efficient clears then you will have to invest more time and get better gear and the "BiS". 
---
I mean, I already see at 44 when going Ulda that people with lv38 tell me that my "prerequirements" (I invite 41+ only for ulda) were ridicoulous and that I'm too elitist, this is when you put the "play casual" mentality to an absurd extreme, for somethings you just need to be well prepared in order to **not miss** 70% of your attacks on the boss and the effort that comes with it either gets done or you find people nice enough to drag you along and compensate missing dmg or heal. Often these "underleveled" party members are then the ones that facepull by accident with typing their excuse faster then the mob approaches (indication that it might have been an on-purpose pull too speed trough).
---
Before I rant any more, I say that I do get it that it sucks but for some things it is just better to be well prepared, I'm not anywhere close to raiding yet but I know well enough that I'll first have to grind some gear before I go MC when I hit 60.
---
Hunters still solo DM tribute. Easy.
---
The aggro fix is not that big of an issue. Adapt. Get better.
---
That guild name
---
why would I?
---
This is a libram enchant (hand in at NPC, apply yourself), not one an enchanter profession can perform.
---
First of all, fuck you. Mage utility is for the mage and the mages group. We don't owe every person running around town a fucking thing. People can fucking smell a mage conjuring water. I've gotten water for a rando and then had 6 other people whisper in that time. I have my own preparations I need to do for my group, sometimes we don't have time for that shit.

I would very much like to test this, as I too am frustrated that there are no data texts for healing other part members. I find it handy to be able to see healing text incase I miss where a renew has fallen off. I'll be checking this out later me thinks!

Stranglethorn Vale. I remember walking home from school in the winter with snow up to me knees. When I got home the bottom of my jeans were wet, hands cold with a runny nose. I went up to my computer, logged in to Stranglethorn Vale and the music and the zone just made me forget about the winter weather and warmed me up. It felt like I transported to some tropical country.
---
You can level cooking with or without fish, it's super cheap either way. The bigger issue will be getting the relevant recipes, which requires quite a bit of traveling around.
---
I believe looking for a specific drop is perfectly fine. Just make sure your potential groups healer already has it before you join. That is what I do and as I am playing on a large server I never had trouble finding a group that meets the criteria. Keep in mind I only started doing so after I got all the feral loot from the instance. Running the dungeon for a specific piece of loot is one thing, needing almost every item your class can wear is another. But even when running as feral with "feral need" it is obviously fine to roll on stuff nobody else needs, so you will already have some heal gear by the time you finish your feral set.
---
Overall specifically looking for groups not needing the item I'm looking for worked pretty well so far. The only thing I dislike is that I've had cases where I suspect the group kicked their healer before inviting me. It can make sense from their perspective as it is usually far easier to find a healer not needed a particular piece than a tank (especially one you know has most of his pre-raid BiS and started hunting for offspec gear), but it is still a dick move.

---
Not really, because everyone can realize the true market value of the BoE. Yet only the people, that can wear a BoP and who are present during the time and place of the drop can realize its value.
---
I agree.  As a player on a RP server it's also not really RP friendly, although I haven't run into any myself (yay)

Just hit 40, Xmas or January sometime if I continue at the same rate. Loving the slow grind :)

If it's an upgrade- need it

If it's a purple worth some gold- need it

If it's a recipe worth some gold- need it

Raiding a capital city with multiple raids gets people in trouble?

Cool post but the OP is about devilsaur leather.
---
Yea but it's such a tremendous increase in value that might as well wait. Guilds will be stockpiling epics in advance, and you don't want to miss out.
---
Baron Geddon does pure fire damage, even on his melee attacks, so you can stack 315 FR and tank the inferno
---
Probably easier to just shimmy a few steps away and wait for it to end though

I have my Hearthstone set in Gadgetzan, but yeah, same idea.
---
Mage travel is a breeze.
---
i don't know what you mean at all. i'm still 58 despite playing 2-4 hours daily and focusing almost entirely on leveling. maybe it takes a little longer to get a warrior to 60, but you still have to average like 10 hours/day
---
Happened with me in the last raid... First boss, got MC and cleaved to death. Feels really bad to lose ony and DM buff right away... REALLY bad.  :(
---
Of course it is. Its not like he's spending gold. And i seriously doubt he's neglecting the other drops. So he's goldfarming with a bag as an added bonus. I dont see the issue

Did you even view the post before writing your essay on why tanks deserve everything?
---
I agree with your points but the post wasn‚Äôt aimed at the orb reserve. It‚Äôs the post above it along with the ban at the bottom.
---
I've heard that until 30 you should quest, then grind until 45 because of low experience rewards, preferably dungeons, then quest again to 60. I've personally didn't pay much attention to it, since I'm not speedrunning the game and just did whatever.
---
Actually just do whatever dungeon and keep your pet in follow if you fear it may be too low level. Don't need to waste time running lower dungeons.
---
You're correct. You all cleared the enemies and gold buys bis for every class. If I win edgemasters as a druid I'd sell them and buy a warden staff, for example.
---
Ashenvale. It's beautiful and I love the music.
---
no layers : if 100+ people are in same area you can see them all at anytime.
---
with layers :  100+ people in area depending on setting of layers it will reduce the amount people you see or compete for resources  with, such as 2+ layers 50 people each will be seen even when in same zone.
---
low numbers of players in a zone make layers is meaningless but when 300+ people are trying farm,quest or explore the same area they helped a lot. people did not like them thu as they felt it cheapen how wow should be.
---
My orc rogue is 56 and i still keep my mask in my bank.
---
I actually thought it was 30 days on retail also bro don‚Äôt feel bad
---
Bad news. It's a useless pet. If you want to hold it, it's not really matter if it has no skills. Just stable your scorpid and tame another one until you learn it's abilities. Then switch your pets and teach skills to your scorpid.
---
For PVE, use a bird that has screech so it can aoe tank easily. I prefer cats for nuking.
---
power guild ?
---
That‚Äôs not what‚Äôs happening here
---
I lvled up in Classic WoW using Questie and I liked it quite a bit. There are plenty of things that seem to not work correctly though so for me this Addon was more of a "hint towards location and mobs".
---
Often I had to read the quest any way because for some quests like the rep quest the in winterspring for example, you have to kill 2 types of mobs but the tooltip says you have to kill one type of mob for both questitem drops.
---
Also there are quests where you have to go to specific points and use/loot something and Questie only shows one location and tells me that all the things required for that quest are at that location. Quite annoying but it helped me with questing nonetheless.
---
Wetlands. Its a open swamp that flips you off every 10 seconds with raptors, swamp things, and ganking!!
---
Exactly.. alot of people do dungeons,  and such ro lvl - For me,  i quest alone all the time.  There are just so many times ive had to pull one mob at a time,  and reset the rest.. my statement stands,  I would not be 60 if this change was live when i started.. Im really glad i dinged yesterday..
---
Every youtube video says it has 10-15 respawn time. Dunno where did you get that 2h thing.
---
I don't feel bad at all, just putting down a troll. Don't worry :D
---
Probably other people camping AH with an auto clicker
---
if it's rotting, just tell her to keep the tip
---
Why would you need 7 melee to do jed/red runs? You only need 5 ppl
---
fury tanking is by far the best option for Baron Geddon and Ragnaros as well as all fire elementals in MC where a shield is literally useless
---
as well as Onyxia where you just need HP pool to survive the breath but generate way more aggro
---
Honestly, just the bracers are good unless you get the set bonus.
---
Layering doesn't affect Queue times. Layering doesn't affect Queue times. Layering doesn't affect Queue times. Layering doesn't affect Queue times. Queues are based on the total number of people connected to the server i.e. the total number of people in the same unique name pool.
---
 Layering is about which instance of the world you are in, just like with a dungeon instance you only see PCs and NPCs that are in the same ID as you.
---
I love the Barrens! Such a nice chat there.
---
The other day I found a Plans: Mithril Shield Spike in a chest, then the very next kill got a set of Edgemaster's Handguards. Got my epic mount waiting for me when I hit 60 lol.
---
Watch youtube videos on it. 
---
Dispel purple debuffs fast, use low rank renew on the ones being arrowed 
---
Oil of immolation/mana pots essential
---
That's normal and is indeed the usual price, I did it a few times too, though usually to guildies for no charge because I can't be bothered to spam trade. Warlocks, hunters, priests and druids solo maraudon for gold (though not as much anymore since there are better farming options in DM) and selling the ring is an easy way to earn extra buck.
---
I'm not aware of anyone who can solo last boss of ZF so yeah you need a group.
---
Imho you're both wrong - everyone should have rolled need. If I was in a group and a BoE item dropped that was an upgrade for me, other classes wouldn't need it to equip but they could sell it and buy a BoE upgrade for themselves with the gold. My mindset is that if you \~really\~ need a specific BoE item, why haven't you bought it already? The BoE items that I need I've already bought (or am actively farming gold to purchase them in the case of freezing band/t1 belt).
---
"Tip" lol that sounds like paying for services. lol
---
Buffs are for group members. Have you ever seen a mage charge for water in a group? Have you ever seen them charge for their AI in a group or AB?
---
Does that pally get hounded for their buff and hand out that buff to tens of randoms every time they log in, inside any city?
---
Playing a similar spec but more pvp orientated.
---
I have to disagree that NS is necessary for pvp.
---
As a deep Feral with powershifting you just force your enemy into the defensive as you do too much damage.
---
Improved Bear Stun allows you to shred 2 times or 3 with a proc, this melts any class.
---
I can guarantee.
---
On my realm it's 20 g when the ring drops, or that's how it's advertised at least. Haven't been in such a group myself and don't know how it'd be enforced, but seeing how some friends and guildies did \~20-30 Princess runs before getting it (some didn't get it after that, either) I'd probably be happy to pay 20 g for it when it drops.
---
Blizzard did a real fuck you when they made this quest. I did the quest twice and the rod seemed to drop within the first 5 kills. Lucky me. But the fuck you part is completing it at that damned grave. If you enter from the river you might die once getting to the grave and once getting out. 
---
This quest is a very memorable moment in hillsbrad therefore I wouldn't miss it and I wouldn't skip it.
---
The videos say that, but many tanks won‚Äôt heed that warning. They‚Äôll go full ape mode because ‚Äúlook at much deeps as tank, hurdy fucking dur‚Äù
---
But I got no issues.. Thats the thing. Im in a really good guild of friends and family, but im not really making much gold in those. Most items goes to the guildbank. - In pugs however, I do m ake a pretty penny, and friends along side of it. Usually, I need one or two items pr run, but i make sure to loot and clean the dungeons. If i need stuff for real, i do my own runs or guildruns.
---
I knew I‚Äôve seen that name. Well done!
---
Kodo graveyard :( RIP
---
Ooof. That's rough.
---
You don't need a tank to farm devilsaur leather. God you must suck if you always use a tank.
---
Which is a huge amount and most of them are really bad at the game.
---
Thats all stuff from BRD or in the same lvl range as BRD. Also all + healing so no is going to roll against u. Priests only roll against priests in raids until class tokens come out (with trinkets being exceptions).
---
One server gets split into copies of itself (layers) to temporarily increase server capacity of players.
---
Ex: one server capped at 6,000 players, or one server split into two layers with each layer having a 4,000 player cap (8,000 total).
---
Good honest question - not sure why some redditholes downvoted you. But, to avoid the heat, maybe try looking into the mage class discord. I wish I had the link for you, but I don't have it available atm.
---
You should be able to get good answers like the one posted from robertodeltoro here, but hopefully without the negativity of downvote monsters.
---
Best of luck! =)
---
You offered it and are a lowbie. Good enough for most. All the salty ppl here are the guys that cause mages to ignore people.
---
Wait. Youre a rogue and got camped? 
---
\*wish i felt bad.\*
---
It‚Äôs less conventional but you can also say you are only going to be rolling on healing gear. That‚Äôs what I did on pservers.
---
Yes, this is a shitty trend
---
Classic Orgrimmar, of course
---
If the ring is still on your pre-raid BiS list, then you‚Äôre not getting ripped off at all.
---
People parking dudes on black lotus spawn points and logging out and in in less than 2 seconds. Those are definitely bots.

Wow dude you completely missed the point of this post...

From what I heard, potions for wPvP.

I've had this happen to me upon taming 2 other rares.  They didn't come with the skills they were supposed to.  However, it's easy just to tame another pet that has the skills they need and teach them your rare pet.
---
From your comments, you don't seem to understand how to do this correctly.  Look up how to teach your pet new abilities and you will be fine.
---
Consequently, I ran sm lib and the rogue in my group had this shitty white offhand dagger. The caster dagger dropped, but he rolled greed and didn't win it. No one rolled need on it, so our tank got to vendor it. He didn't roll because it had +int on it.
---
I mean if the weapon doubles your offhand dps, I feel like rolling need is warranted.

Or you could just relax a bit and not take a website and its ways so seriously that it manifests in angry comments, but you do you.
---
I liked the presentation style, but shitting on other content creators like that, no matter what they do.. not cool. No wonder he's banned on twitch.
---
Is there any way to set an addon to tell you're targeted and going to be MC'ed? I could have vanished, but I only saw the cast in the last 0.5s and wasn't able to cancel it.
---
But what's the difference between LFdps, item X reserved or LFdps, only mages allowed ?
---
Plenty of groups forming, why should I accept a fellow hunter in my group to roll on my items? I will just say ' no sorry, looking for other type of dps'. Isn't stating something is reserved much easier?
---
Genuine question. I was in the 'reserving items is toxic' camp first.
---
Blackrock Depths, just stealthing around and exploring
---
I lost a mageblade yesterday on a reroll. The dude went first, rolled a 15, I was sure I had it, and BAM, I roll an 11.
---
Yes, this will totally ruin the economy, please Mods and Blizzard, do something about this.
---
It takes 1 and a half minute to craft 6 stacks of water which saves people 15 gold if they would have bought it of a vendor, tipping a random mage for holding him up in a major city and saving yourself money is just a nice thing to do. Mages are btw not the most popular class.
---
It is in fact 30 days if it's not tied to a CoD. I sent a bunch of lockboxes to a rogue friend of mine, but they quit playing eventually, and I've had to wait 30 days for all those boxes to be returned to me through mail.
---
I've never seen a Lotus out in the world (overfarmed like crazy). On the other hand I haven't seen anyone using a flask yet, as all the content is trivial.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if Lotus price increases with the release of phase 2. Not only will there be more competition between gatherers when they lift the remaining layers, but people aiming for high PVP ranks actually have a reason to use flasks.
---
Wait. You have THREE level 60s AND still have a gf???
---
Dude eat your cake too...
---
exactly.  
---
...excuse me, i see an undead that i need to make dead-dead.
---
So if they equip it immediately, they can't sell on AH.
---
/r/woosh
---
Just try it, you are a tank, you will find a group
---
I got a few lotuses before dropping herbalism, mostly by rushing Silithus after server restarts.
---
The short answer is yes. Because there are less layers (or none), there is less ease of access to resources. Thus the value of those resources goes up. The price will normalise quite quickly I would expect.
---
Can I watch it on my phone?
---
True. But no raid is realistically gonna prefer 100% uptime and shit dps (hunter) over 70-80% uptime and decent dps (warrior). Unless you have like... 27 mages and one hunter, but in that case, you have bigger problems :P
---
Zul'Gurub. It was the first raid that I was able to do when it was current tier in vanilla. The fights were fun and the anticipation of the entire raid every single week in the hopes of the raptor or tiger dropping was great. Knowing every single person in the raid wanted the exact same item - that did effectively nothing but look cool.
---
The supply has remained exactly constant. Spawn timers for herbs and ores were doubled if you had two layers. Now they are halved, but only one layer.

It is and it's not an unpopular opinion.  Stop karma whoring things you know aren't unpopular.

this discord is fucking stupid. Mods on powertrips, ban for any question, banned if you say FAQ is lacking, banned for basically anything other than sucking mods dick
---
Auberdine, always believed my Druid was from there. With all of the destruction to both Auberdine and the Darnassus, she's been thru alot.
---
As a rogue I had a guy ask me if I could open a bunch of lockboxes for him.  Opened about 20 in a row and on the last and final box, I expected a nice big tip.  He gave me nothing other than a TY.   I'm not going to tell you how I responded, but it wasn't great.  lol.
---
i only play about one or two hours a night.
---
I helped 2 priests who was having trouble with it due to gear. Get a druid to buff you with thorns as they said it helped a lot. Also if you do die he can res you so you can continue but then will have to just stand there and let them kill him or you will fail
---
It's not free if you're working for it. By all means, play how you like, it's just completely inefficient when you could make the gold far easier elsewhere and just buy a regular 16slot, that's all we're saying
---
Do people ask you to constantly battleshout in cities and during offtime?
---
Rep gated crafts deserve a decent tip imo
---
Then he can sell his Reddit account for mount money!
---
Yes, because it's MY group that I took the time to organize. Make YOUR own group and have your own rules. Clown.
---
I take it you don't like Skarm?
---
1. there's far less tanks than dps/healers
---
 2. tanks wear plate, plate costs a lot to repair
---
 3. tanks get constantly hit, meaning their gear constantly gets closer and closer to breakage, not only on wipes
---
 4. there are 0 upgrades for tanks in stratholme living
---
 5. tanks do less damage &amp; are extremely anoying to farm gold with
---
 6. tanks are essentially babysitters for the group, expected to know the way,...
---
 7. tanks can't afk or half-ass dungeons, if a dps goes on a minute auto-attack streak they lose agro and die
---
 8. 9/10 pug dps faceroll aoe, making it a hassle and a half for the tank to keep threat, making the run physically tiring.
---
 9. having a good tank will make a run and having a bad tank breaks a run
---
So you bet your ass i'm going to reserve the first orb for myself as tank, the 15g a orb is on my server about covers a repair cost from 0-100%, something that happens with most pugs anyway.
---
tanking dungeons with pugs is mentally draining.
---
there's about 1 tank and 2 healer sfor every 12 dpssers, meaning my skillset is in higher demand
---
‚Äã
---
dpssers can easy go farm gold by doing professions or mob grinding outside dungeons, tanks can't.
---
‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
---
if you're not ok with how this works, create a tank and change it yourself. but once you're in my place, you're just going to do exactly the same as me, because of all of the above
---
If you are a good player, you will be aware of what everyone else is doing, and whether they are doing it well.
---
Unfortunately, most players seem to have issues with awareness. Healers and tanks at least are forced to pay some attention to their group, but DPS players (if they want) can simply focus on their current target and ignore everything else.
---
seems i've jumped the gun with all the hate been thrown around in /world and /lfg when a tank needs anything for repair costs &amp; i figured they throught the tank reserving something was the mafia
---
You can return the item. You still need to click it all individually
---
Ironforge for sure, it‚Äôs where I get to open all my mail from AH sales
---
/r/woooosh
---
Rogues should level their lockpicking while leveling their character, imo. There are literally dedicated areas in the world to do so, and they typically correlate with where you might find yourself questing anyway. As long as you stay relatively current with your lockpicking, you won't usually have to spend too much time on it. 
---
I've never understood Rogues who wait until 60 to level lockpicking. They're actually just making it harder by having to revisit low level zones.
---
First of all dick,
---
The name is clutch lrn2read,. Everyone knows Chuck is my son. 
---
Secondly I've gotten more compliments about my name since I rolled on that server then you have had good days apparently.
---
My keybinds are just fine and dandy I'm playing with a 12-button mouse how about you you still using the keyboard like a scrub?
---
And finally sorry your retail piece of shit game isn't doing so well.
---
I experienced something similiar when I hit 60 when people remembered me from questing or running dungeons together while leveling.
---
But server reputation goes both ways so there are player on my realm who made it their goal to be known for streamsniping and corpsecamping streamer far below 60 (usually in a group of 5-15 players).
---
Just because there is a safeguard in the system doesn't mean it isn't an attempt to scam. It's just a bad one.
---
If you are using \[abbr.name\] then SUF is going to truncate the name. Try use \[name\] to see if that gives you what you want.
---
It's still pathetic. Fundamentally egoistical. But you and I might be cut out of a different piece of paper so it's probably hard to explain to someone that sees no problem with reserving items in advance. The roll system is there for a reason. It's whether you're lucky or not. Get in line, be friendly and nice to those around you and yeah, you might be unlucky, but tough shit dude, that's life, it isn't fair. I don't care if you've run BRD 80 or 100 times and lost the roll 15 times.
---
It's fucking pre-raid BIS in a 15 year old game everyone has already figured out. Relax.
---
Wtf! All of this randomness from a post about devilsaur mafia? ü§£
---
Tbh it sounds like BfA might work better for you. All that additional stuff in BfA is what made me quit, but that's mainly because of time gating. Like having a free day to play WoW wouldn't let me push much further because after you have done few quests, you would get a nice rep boost and maybe an item, but trying to push your rep further would work maybe at 1/5 of the efficiency. The system is pretty much designed to keep you logging in every day, since being exalted with every faction is the baseline for many things like crafting, allied races and unlocking flying.
---
However if you only get couple of hours every week, you shouldn't really run into that sort of limitation.
---
At what point are assholes like you going to learn to grow up and not give Reddit a bad name?
---
Stranglethorn Vale. The zone feels so alive and diverse, with tons of cultural references as well!
---
Yes, on Mograine-EU they are also spawning every 5-7 min ish, I think this is pretty bad for the devilsaur economy..:(
---
But isnt reserving more nice then? At least rogues that need quests or other items can still join instead of endlessly looking for a group.
---
Mister Frodo, you are the best thing that classic has brought to us. I fucking adore your posts, thank you :)
---
I can't believe how hard you misread this post
---
This is Reddit dumbass it doesn't matter what you post interesting or not it still gets shit on by people like you.
---
 seems i've jumped the gun with all the hate been thrown around in /world  and /lfg when a tank needs anything for repair costs &amp; i figured  they throught the tank reserving something was the mafia
---
Arathi Highlands. Love the music, love the greenery. I have weirdly fond memories of farming iron ore at ungodly early hours in the morning before school. So chill =)
---
Yeah this is bug for sure..I was helping a friend with low level quest running through goblins 30 levels below me and taking crazy amounts of damage ! They didn't miss ,they care about my armor ..
---
Thought i will be able to pass easy like in vanilla but no go..Its some code bug that wasn't there in original game
---
As a healer, the only deal I would accept is if you tell m in advance that you're going to roll for healing gear but I'd have the opportunity to roll as well. It'd be up to luck who wins the roll. There's no way I'm joining a reserve run.
---
what's with the sarcasm? the dude doesnt like playing as a tank. he likes playing as arms warrior.   
---
he didnt apply to that dungeon to play as a tank in the first place.
---
No, he's a dbag peddling regurgitating information he doesn't truly understand.
---
You seem to be missing the point. That‚Äôs okay!
---
No, on retail there is just personal loot
---
I was able to see him online for a couple days after it happened, but since the ticket was marked resolved I haven‚Äôt seen him on
---
I reserved and got Dal'rends without spending any extra time because there are many people who don't care/want certain items. It's hilarious that you think if you reserve 1 or 2 items that you'll wait "hours".
---
More acronyms please. We all see in your head.
---
No we're just too busy enjoying what we have right now.  Don't you have like a easy mode everything to go to in retail?
---
I like to quest and play solo a lot as my time is quite sporadic.  Questing is fun, but you can easily run outta quests in zones. Running instances also gives you access to good gear upgrades which can last several levels.  
---
If I had the time, I'd maybe run an instances 3-4 maybe even 5 times for the XP, and also quest in between.
---
No the addon wont have access to it if the player himself doesnt have access
---
Its fucking hilarious to see you cry about an ability you chose. I could whine that I am asked to do things my character isnt even specced for constantly, but I'm not a complete pussy like the entire mage community.
---
Stranglethorn Vale
---
Was this on earthen ring? Sounds like the guild I was in!
---
Good tip. I think I'll start with teaching him to fish. Hahahaha.
---
Mash n thrash
---
Yeah, clicking i dividually 50+ times, however many times the guy decides to do it
---
Stranglethorn Vale. No matter how frustrating it becomes for some people, I only have fond memories. It's a wonderful hot spot, with a wide levelrange, beautiful environment, and some spice with the always present risk of pvp-encounters.
---
It's the Vietnam war that never ended! :D
---
And yet you reply to it.  
---
Tell me how that makes sense.
---
I'm just not greedy and I don't need all that much money, so I value quick and simple sells over milking every extra gold. Plus I don't have to contend with AH deposits trying to sell at a higher price, for SoJ it's like 1 gold for each unsold listing.
---
Ironic how you start calling other people blind when you managed to skip most of the text in OPs post and missed the whole point.
---
They don't need to buy it, it just dropped in the dungeon.
---
If it is an upgrade, they should NEED it and equip it immediately.
---
Along with literally 95% of the layer base for the last 15 years.
---
Why do people run into one idiot group and think they represent the entire wow playing world? It makes no sense.
---
Why is the health bar pink?
---
This is a complicated topic.
---
If it is just some common material or drop, like the first orb in strat or thorium mines, sure go ahead, basically its your payment for services rendered and doesn't prevent anyone from getting that stuff themselves.
---
For stuff like rare drops, it is a bit different. Sure, don't like it, don't join the group sounds like a reasonable answer. But only, if there are alternatives available. And that is where it gets complicated. With the usual tank shortage, there might not be any alternatives or only at a very high price (lots of waiting).
---
In the real world, most societies have put rules in place to limit the power of monopolies and cartels, so those powers can not be as easily abused and to give people a viable choice to either work with restrictions imposed or go for the alternatives. This doesn't always work, and were it doesn't work, conditions often suck (see competition for internet providers in many areas).
---
Now ingame, those rules are not present and if you are in a position of power (like tanks seem to be quite often), there is no one stopping you from abusing those powers. It is also unreasonable to tell some player they have to do something they don't want for the greater good, forcing ppl to play something is not going to work.
---
However if every tank in the game just reserves the drops they need and don't run dungeons anymore after they are done, the situation worsenes a lot, as every fresh tank is done equipping in a fraction of time everyone else needs and suddenly is no longer available to groups.
---
So in my opinion, reserving rare item drops is wrong and should be frowned upon, because it just increases the problem of class/role imbalance. If you need an incentive to tank a dungeon, maybe look for one that doesn't worsen the experience of everyone else, because that is just selfish behaviour. Make it some monetary value you get instead of that one drop that everyone needs. And if you feel you really do need to reserve an item, don't stop after you got it. If it takes on average 50 runs to get that drop as $random_player, don't stop running the dungeon after 5 times, because thats just abusing a power you shouldn't have in the first place.
---
And to everyone hating the practise of reserving items, try to not ruin the fun of tanks by doing stupid shit in dungeons, because if you do, who can blame them for taking the easy way out.
---
Found the jealous person
---
I adore Tirisfal Glades, specifically the walkway along to Silverpine. When you approach the forest and see the lake to the left, massive trees appearing. Bonus points if it's Halloween for the Wickerman. That burning haystack is my first memory of WoW as I started playing vanilla during the Hallow's End event. The music too. Everything is just perfect.
---
except you ban people for no reason at all. I talked about the FAQ getting a barebones -&gt; got banned, even though I also posted useful stuff and started a useful discussion were a lot of veterans participated
---
This, the rogue might shave 20 minutes off leveling from the extra dps shadowfang does until he replaces SF, but that's 4 hours of farming on the best farming classes at level 60 (and thats the low end of what SF sells for, it's already up to 1k on some servers). 
---
Need it, sell it, and send him a level 20 blue weapon that is 5g and will help his leveling as much as SF would have.
---
If you need it, need it.
---
Those nerds can suck your blue cock.
---
&gt;Where they private server dudes that had their own following but could not make it to twitch?
---
You guys don't have to download this guy.  
---
A lot of my UI is behind the scenes I really don't care about it right now.
---
I've just been farming gold when I get into more of a RAID mode I'll change it to something different.
---
I'll never be able to have what I wanted.  because with Windows XP I could do horizontal spam and I could have literally all of my add-ons on one blank screen and a blank UI on the other you just can't do that anymore.
---
Thanks :)
---
Now if only I could cash in some of this good will on the allies that keep 2v1ing me in Badlands.
---
No SW:P and MF?  Why even bring a shadow priest at that point?  Do they just Mind Blast and wand the entire fight?
---
I haven't seen this firsthand but I did notice the price starting to plummet, so you might be onto something.
---
Instance, with pet on passive just by your side.
---
The Ruins of Lordaeron. I love the ambience there, and the small details (the roses on the ground from WC 3 cinematic, Terenas' blood in the throne room etc.). The WC3 whispers you're subject to there are also really spooky. Love it.
---
my ign is sharkuu. so i also have sharku√∫ and sharku√π and sharku√ª and shark√∫√π and...you get the point. my ign is sharkuu, no matter what char, but blizz doesnt give me the possibility to just use my name independant of the char, so this is the next best thing
---
yea this ended up being the consensus lol
---
Depends on level difference, to be honest. Yellow mobs around your level - you can usually deal with two simultaneously. If you're able to sneak in to get a ravage first, that helps.
---
If you're trying to take on two oranges/reds, cat form might not cut it. However, bear form should be fine, just takes a little bit longer.
---
Feral faerie fire is really great for mob pulls if you're worried about proximity.
---
Best bet i got is that the mentality changes once people close in on 60 and these expensive items start to drop. Its hard to understand when you do your weekly Wailing caverns run eyeing the change of setting that comes with reaching RFK levels, where nothing expensive really drops. Once you hit 60 and its a regular thing for 200g+ items to drop, most people change their minds and i believe thats why what happens ingame and what reddit spews, are different.
---
Deadmines. It was my first dungeon and first love.
---
Black Rock mountains

Blizzard considers all trade and loot disputes bannable if the agreement has been made clear in chat beforehand.
---
The only person that's missing the point here is you. You can't understand the concept of people making their own groups with their own rules and you bitching about it when you have the option to just not join. 
---
&gt;I guarantee you that they'll never go away because most people aren't dumb and understand why it's a good concept
---
That's all you need to know, keep crying, nothing will change :)
---
They are pretty awesome, even if their mana lasts for 3 seconds.
---
I love the idea of being in a world where everyone on your server is in the same world as you are. No layering, no phasing.
---
If alliance attacks Org then everyone in Org is part of the fight, or If 40+ horde have taken over the Theramore boat, People won‚Äôt be grouping up to defend only to find out ‚Äúoh, they‚Äôve attacked in a different layer‚Äù. 
---
There only exist one world boss, one rare mob, everyone in the same server are in the same place fighting each other for it. 
---
You can gain rivalries with the people grinding the same things as you, someone can gain a reputation for being ‚Äúthat guy who buys all your herbs‚Äù who‚Äôs always standing in the same place buying herbs. He‚Äôs not suddenly gone because he‚Äôs magically on a different plane of reality. 
---
This is one of those things which made classic feel much different from retail. Everyone is on your server and exists in your world at all times. It makes the game immersive. 
---
Overpopulation is a separate issue that should be fixed a different way, not by keeping layers in the game.
---
Also when I start farming I use gathermate2 and gather data along with Farm hud.  So I don't really use my mini map for anyting plus I have combat text that alert me when I'm low health
---
Which one? Retard?
---
and onyxia as an "instance" takes ALOT less than baron run..
---
not counting getting the group/raid together
---
Don't forget defensive stance.
---
-10% received damage is huge, especially since it's the only way to reduce damage taken from elemental autoattacks.
---
ohh yah, it's a massive joke atm due to the 1.12 talents and itemization.  Tons of blues are better than the epics in mc.
---
thats the power argument right there
---
why would anyone get upset anyone had it lol. I don't play primarily play caster classes so maybe I am missing something but people are really crazy about this thing?
---
Stormwind. After spending hours leveling in the monestary or wherever you started and then finally getting a quest to visit the big city the feeling that I first got when experiencing this massive town is just like holy crap, I'm such a small piece in this HUGE world. It really creates a unique perspective that gives you the groundwork for actually starting from the bottom and working your way up in a RPG. Stormwind is my favorite of these massive towns.
---
Fury warriors are just BDSM rogues
---
My vanilla experience as a hunter up through AQ40 before I stopped playing him was this: it is not a huge deal that you have a specific type of pet, but more that you are REALLY good at controlling your pet. It still doesn‚Äôt matter because people will yell at you for having your pet out and your pet will probably at some point do something unintended and dumb.  
---
That being said, I remember there being a wolf from lbrs that gave its party an attack power buff by howling?
---
Just because you use consumables and make your rotation complex does not mean you compete with a dps warrior who makes the same effort and has the same level of gear.
---
thank god! #nochanges but this Mafia bs had to stop.
---
It‚Äôs from blozzard..
---
It annoys me that wowhead has guides written by this chump, as if he's any kind of authority at all
---
Wouldn't raid in this game anyway, you'd need a lobotomy to enjoy a one button rotation.
---
Don't reserve stuff. Just say at the start that you intend to roll on healing gear as well.
---
It's the reserving that makes you a shit, not needing the gear.
---
Man, that's an old meme.
---
What class are you? As a tank I love it.
---
All I see is a B.A.D. guild.
---
&gt;  I just think he's trying to flex at this point.
---
$5 says it's fake
---
that's ridiculous man. if you need an item in a dungeon that is an upgrade.. that's what "need" is literally for. people abuse the system of need/greed because, well they're human, and pieces of shit; if everyone only needed when they did indeed need (like you did) and greed when they dont, this would all be a happy world.
---
just keep doing what you're doing, they are stupid.
---
Unpopular opinion: I think they reduced the number of layers on high population servers too quickly.
---
No one missed your point, people disagreeing with you aren't missing your point. Don't worry, no one wants to discuss anything further with a clown who can only keep saying "you missed my point" when he fails at arguing for his dumb point :)
---
Hunter having jumper cables was a must in my vanilla guild back in the day.
---
Now. The soulbound on need has been in since at least Wrath.
---
Yeah im sure it was a lot harder back then but its still a numbers game with 0 relevant mechanics. We'd just have to grind a lot more consumes.
---
We use agony on bosses after the other relevant curses are up and just rotate among ourselves. Stop talking bullshit.

There's a link at the bottom to the source but as Blizzard made the addon unusable a month ago and the site was setup to dynamically change with more recent data month to month its all a bit broken right now.

When the healer joins the group "Hey, I'm going to roll on X healing items as well, just so you know"

Is that so hard?

But WW axe is better isn't it?

Sappers are great for pve dps, also a requirement if you want to cheese viscidus.

Also being able to make your own gun ammunition is clutch.

Pleas see the Pic this entire thread is based on.

They buff the warlocks
---
Bane?!
---
The weird mentalities are the same ones that have been cropping up around all over the gaming world.
---
Losing is never ok in any game. If you are losing you must blame someone for it and make them feel bad for losing.
---
If you need an item in a game that someone else can make use of then its "you vs them" and they you need to make up some bullshit excuse to why you should get it instead of them - or at least get the chance to get it.
---
I might sound really old but when i was a kid (20 years ago) people just fucking played the game. I was utterly terrible at warcraft 3, but when i joined a random 2v2 match and i sucked my ally did not whine and blame me for the less.
---
When i rolled need on an item in a dungeon nobody batted an eye (unless i rolled on something i could not use - which i never did, because why should i roll on something i dont need).
---
It‚Äôs a player-created custom channel
---
Wow people are assholes.
---
When a boss is clearly in a pack of 4 bodyguards because it was designed in such a way that you have to fight them all, then you being able to circumvent that through some shitty ass vanilla mechanic does not constitute good gameplay. All the RRREEEEEE MY EXPLOITS posts here are fucking saddening. It's as if gaming the system is the only game you play. How about just playing the game as it was clearly intended.
---
Agree with your sentiment, but it seems like bear druids are top of threat at the moment.
---
They of course have their own set of problems with mitigation, which is why they're still niche.
---
If you are looking for an alternative just do maraudon princess runs.  
---
Its not Nova AOE farming but still solid for around 20-30g/h

The village of the dancing trolls that can be seen on the flight between moonglade and rutheran village.
---
I have provided free water and food for as long as I can remember. No paying needed. Only jerks demand payment.
---
As a Mage, I never gank warriors. I'll only fight back if they really force me to - the poor class has such a tough time levelling, and the matchup is so unbalanced, that I just can't do it.
---
Its bis profession for pvp and pve alike.
---
&gt; Eventually people will realize after 5 hrs of lfm and put themselves in the shoes of their potential party members..."Hmm, why aren't anybody joining our group? Surely there are other people who need...OH!"
---
In my experience the group will fill just as fast as a regular group if only one item is reserved.
---
Darnassus, seems like a lovely place to climb/do Parcours at.

The graveyard is the only place that makes me feel at home.

Shaman: if you see someone making the swim out to or back from the Hydraxian Waterlords, you throw them a Waterwalking.

All other classes: Send your shaman friends fish oil.
---
im with you man...got my lock to 40, rolled a warrior, got him to 40 as well + mount, rolled a mage - he's 37 now and i lost the will to play.   
---
i think my problem is that i started on a pvp server. ive never played wow on anything but pvp servers and i loved it, but i guess when i was younger, my tolerance level was higher.   
---
now im at a point that grinding became too sucky but doable, but when i choose to go out a play, i keep getting ganked almost everywhere.  
---
so im now at the "fuck it" point and i stopped playing.
---
I‚Äôm having trouble deciphering how a mage getting slaughtered probably before he even realized what was going on makes him shit.
---
Also, note: the average player is fairly shit. And most players are average or below. Odds are high that you (and myself) would be within those bounds. Shit talk doesn‚Äôt remove you from consideration.
---
That could be the reason convincing them is a bit hard and has failed so far...
---
wait wait wait is this also with open world mobs?  If it is RIP in peace warriors
---
found someone from tip's shit guild.  You don't deserve to be treated like that brother.  You can do better.  We are here to help!
---
Priests bring more than just healing. Ex: some assigned to healing. Some dispelling, etc. 
---
As it is, our longest boss kill in MC is under 1:30. Our shortest is 0:24.
---
Tell the healers you recruit to the run that you want to roll on healing gear and then you have a fair shot on it. Why would any healer join for a run when there is not even a chance to get loot?
---
And it‚Äôs definitely not spelled out as clearly as you think.
---
/world is a player created chat channel, so players moderate it. 
---
in vanilla, the moderation system for player-made chat channels is really, really poorly designed. the second you log off you lose all moderation controls and its automatically passed on to someone else at random.
---
on private servers, gms typically made the world chat and moderated it so players didn't have to deal with this.
---
i suppose players are so used to /world (or /global) being the norm so they didn't think twice about joining it when classic wow released.
---
Wolf from LBRS is the best for raids
---
I guess that explains the reason Sulfuras had a 30 min queue last night...
---
then the healer leaves and u look like a twat wasting everyone's time.
---
There is no World chat, only a player-created custom channel named 'world'. This is an important distinction, because custom channels have owners who can do things like this, and can also password-protect the entire channel.
---
This isn't even a grey area, it's a straight up scam attempt.
---
so then why did kromkrush have a 1hr + queue time last night when there hasnt been a queue in weeks?
---
Thats some sick dps!
---
I heard 'Deathmaw' is good as a wolve because of faster attack speed? Might be the one I will go for.
---
I just had a vision of 30 years from now, when were old and aging. Retail WoW gold is now linked directly to your bank account; as long as money is flowing you've got gold.  Cue to us speaking to our kids and/or grandkids:
---
"WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE, WE HAD TO FARM OUR GOLD THROUGH GRIT AND METTLE. IT WAS A HARSH WORLD of warcraft AND IT FORMED US INTO THE HARD WORKING MEN AND WOMEN WE ARE TODAY."
---
*Our kids are rolling their eyes at us as they swipe their debit card into the official Blizzard card reader so he can get access to his 7th active mount slot* "Yea sure, whatever you say grandpa"
---
if you on Golemagg, drop me a line :)
---
Why do you rely on this Discord? Just leave it ...
---
The tank fears the healer but everyone fears the tank. At least on my server due to the lack of tanks.
---
It‚Äôs crazy now knowing what it does because I was so amazed by it when I was 9. They uses to summon it in Goldshire &amp; as well as Duels ALL DAY in goldshire.
---
Even if the only person on the server with it?
---
Scholomance. I don't know what it is about the dungeon, but it has always been one of my favorite to run.
---
I once had a guy win a BoE Tailoring Recipe worth like 50g (he was the only one who rolled). 
---
Not even 10 mins later a blue BoE item and upgrade for our healer drops and he decided to roll Need aswell (It was leather, he was a mage). 
---
That item wasn't even worth half as much as his recipe. Fortunately he gave it up after some talk.
---
According to wowhead, Ravager has a drop chance of 14%.
---
(1-0.14)^23 = 0.03%
---
Was looking for this a month ago. Gonna try later today.
---
Can we get a non-vanilla clipping distance please? it would be sooo damn epic
---
I agree with macros, it makes the game brainless and automated af.
---
Haha that‚Äôs because the gold is owned by Blizzard, not by you. Read the TOS. Your analogy doesn‚Äôt work.
---
Just because you didn't live in Rome in 200 BC doesn't mean you can't make a documentary about it.
---
how do you know this is true?
---
I wouldn't worry about it. All the couples I know who speak the same language don't communicate at all.
---
Not my full UI, but it's ElvUI :)
---
Thanks.
---
I was referring to both dungeons and solo. I like that prot gets me instant invites into groups but solo is pretty slow. I‚Äôll try my spec with a 2h and see how that goes but I think without SoC it will be about the same as 1h and shield
---
They might have just ran out the water...
---
Doesn't CoT silence the caster if they cleanse it? If so, for PvP, that would have to be my "go-to" spell, unless 1v1 against a non-caster. In which case, you've already got better answers than I could offer from other, more experienced players.
---
What‚Äôs funny is people want dalrends so badly, but Krol blade + mirahs song is also a good optional. Do I want to spend hours on end grinding dalrends or simply buy Krol blade for 300g which is only a couple hours an dmirahs song is a quest that can be done in scholo in one run.
---
I've seen a few, Benafflock is one of my faves since it includes his spec too üòÇ
---
Are you trying to say that you didn't deserve a ban? Because if so, then maybe your ban should have been longer since you clearly learned nothing.
---
It‚Äôs not random, it goes to people who have been in the channel the longest
---
Nah he actually said that. He meant it.
---
The rogue waiting to distract someone was a nice touch.
---
If you're on my team then you get water. If you're a random interrupting what I'm doing with a request then you pay for it. Pretty simple. My casts take time and depending on the level of water you want and my level, that can require drinking in between button presses.
---
So you're that guy I instantly ignore in game. Nice to meet you, fucko.
---
But I already gave mr Blozzard my bank card information he asked
---
to be fair, paladin can main tank Onyxia and all quite easily given **how righteous fury work**. We've seen enough people doing it.
---
Lack of taunt isn't always a problem as well, given some boss (even if just a few) are immun to it.
---
Bot user confirmed!
---
r/woooosh ?
---
I know that grind but I would get burnt out too quickly in vanilla. Luckily with classic I dont have much play time so everytime I play it's fun no matter what I do. Glad you found the light again.

---
In my opinion these are the only items worth spending gold on. Do dungeons for everything else.
---
You say he's a scumbag, but you don't want him to be shown to the public and face repercussions for his actions?
---
Sounds hypocritical to me
---
Gotta love people*
---
People do this, not individual factions.
---
grave moss is a plant that you find near graves, it has nothing to do with the flesh eating worms.
---
Then OP gets his axe back. Mission accomplished.
---
You get 10% armor either way I think, 10 def kinda sucks for 5 point investment, and lack of parry hurts but not nearly enough to be immediately noticeable. Nothing even remotely close to not wearing a shield and charging in like an idiot.
---
Honestly I'm always greeding BoEs and so is everyone else I run with and so far all went well. An epic might make people pause though.
---
fury warriors think they are superior to rogues so rogues are allowed to roll on loot only with their permisson
---
i thought mages are pretentious but Im seeing this warrior nazis more and more often
---
Smooth
---
What server is this?
---
You kill a boss you are locked to that raid ID. MC resets every Tuesday NA and Ony resets every 5 days.
---
Definitely not for AoE
---
First person on my realm did 400g per craft, but you get ALOOOT more customers if the fee is 100g, so technically you should be making alot more gold
---
Westfall, there's a certain peace yet chaos to it.  And it has some of the best music in the whole game.
---
I have a question about rotations on Hunters.
---
I recently got a weapon that's slower than 3 seconds (3.3s), which is the ideal according to guides, because it allows you to weave Aimed Shots in between auto shots.
---
Using timer addons, though, my aimed shot seems to be taking longer to fire than a single auto shot rotation, so I'm missing an auto shot every time.
---
The actual auto shot is 2.7s plus it seems 0.5s reloading, which pauses due to Aimed Shot being charged still.
---
Am I doing something wrong here?
---
Never played wow before but I like Hillsbrad as it reminds me of the Shire :D
---
Damn man, I had no idea this was a service that was provided.
---
Thank you for this! I definitely accidentally sold a few items that I didn't mean to and now they are restored!
---
So again, thank you for bringing this to my attention!
---
No, that‚Äôs Unstable Affliction, in TBC
---
Elwynn Forest since I never got to play until Warlords of Draenor and never realized just how peaceful it is without people flying everywhere and just taking time to explore the world
---
Soul link or siphon life?

&gt;knowing when it is pointless
---

The cod will be back to you in 3 days, this is a troll who is trying to scam you.

Don't feed it.
---
Blackrock mountain on raid night, there's nothing quite so thrilling as large scale pvp imo
---
Imagine a server where Redridge is horde free.
---
Ah Okey üòä 
---
Yeah, Faerie fire seems great for pulling and making a fight easier.
---
Everyone but me. I'm still stuck with Whirlwind Axe...
---
Well that was the case back in 1.1 and beyond too. The 1.12 gear is kinda OP compared to what was originally in at launch, definitely, but most of the gear in MC was always kind of bad.
---
What is the public going to do except harass him?
---
His punishment should be done by Blizzard.
---
Best will be tier 2 helm and legs. Tier 1 shoulders belt boots bracers gloves. True faith chest. Tier 1 chest and legs are bad.... tier 1 isn‚Äôt the best in terms of raw healing power but the other stats it provides help a lot. I‚Äôve never ran MC and not been hit at least once. If you‚Äôre dead you aren‚Äôt healing. I see so many BIS blues priests that are paper tigers and get obliterated from a slight scratch. You will get hit.
---
Dun Morogh at night. Started the journey there and the music still gets me. Especially on the frozen lake.
---
They called him "M'uru the guild destroyer" on the forums back then.
---
SM/DS is best farm spec.
---
Tbf, better chance for that helm to drop again for them than the charger
---
You will get mixed feed back on that front. Ultimately the goal is to emulate Vanilla as closely as possible. So the expectation is we won't see these things.
---
Experience - Before doing this, the chest had at most 2 blue items, and never any of the ones I mentioned. After doing it one of the mentioned item is always in the chest.
---
It's basically tricking the game into thinking you are doing the Ogre suit event, which I assume is what flags the extra loot in the chest.
---
That makes sense! Thank you
---
Actually, about half of the US realms are horde dominated and the other half alliance dominated. Both sides range from anywhere from 51% to 75%. Fun fact, Wyrmthalak is a 99.6% alliance dominated realm, the most out of balance realm in the game.
---
If you've killed a boss, you'll get locked. If you join a raid that already has lock and got in the dungeon, you'll get locked.
---
If no one killed a boss, you can farm trash.
---
**''Unpopular opinion: Rolling need on blue BoE upgrades from a dungeon and equipping them should be acceptable and encouraged - and here is a store of how i would benefit from this being the case''.**
---
Uhm, alright.
---
9% hit is the soft cap vs level 63 targets ASSUMING you only have 300 weapon skill.
---
With 305 weapon skill you'll only need 6% hit to be soft capped. 
---
Luckily, Rogues get both 5% hit AND +5 extra weapon skill if specced properly, so you'll actually only need 1% hit to be soft capped as a Rogue.
---
Which chat is most commonly used for looking for group for dungoens (30ish and above)?
---
I mean sure, but Shadow doesn‚Äôt bring any unique utility to a raid group that a healer wouldn‚Äôt already bring.
---
I see this argument all the time about how ‚ÄúRet brings BoP and LoH‚Äù and ‚ÄúFeral has Innervate and CR‚Äù, but the fact is that these things are not unique to the spec. Healers bring all these things (usually superior versions too) and more.
---
If you kill one boss or join a raid that has killed a boss and accept the lockout you are locked to that instance and that instance only
---
For example
---
You kill 1 boss in MC and the raid falls apart you will not be able to join someone else‚Äôs run be it a fresh run or joining after the boss you killed in your raid.
---
Baradin Bay, fishing as an orc greeting all Alliance who pass me.

---
Shadow does acceptable dps, and has one of the best buffs for warlocks - who are one of the best DPS classes in classic. 
---
If you enjoy it and don't get bummed out that you're not n1 dps - you're fine ;)
---
Then I don't get why you're complaining?? It probably weeds out the impatient people you don't want to run dungeons with either.
---
Yeah pvp, my bad
---
You should probably drop engineering for tailoring to get your robes, and then drop it and take engineering again.
---
Gotta love Zul'Drak, the dark story of the zone, the lore and trolls... good times.
---
That's a lot of fuckin' people.
---
I remember groups in SM trying to force spellcleave just because I was a mage. But I'd be the only mage. I'd tell them it doesnt work out like that and I'd get kicked for "being bad" haha. Then I'd just join a real aoe grp.
---
&gt; has nothing to do with that tbh
---
The shield also adds a shit ton of armor. Sure you can dual wield tank MC, but when your tanks are dieing left and right, putting on a shield sure as hell won't hurt.
---
Awesome, thanks. Glad to see that the other two I play on have very strong Alliance populations.
---
Reading through discord TOS I'd say it borders on breaking their TOS, since he is technically breaking blizzards TOS on in game currency exchange. I would throw a report to discord, however, I would also report him to Blizzard. As demanding gold in exchange for services, access, whatever, outside of gameplay is definitely against their TOS.
---
Good luck man.  Not claiming to be the best priest NA or anything but feel free to pm if you have questions.
---
Hardcore gaming and endgame is not for everyone. If you are getting stressed about it then maybe is not for you, so don't sweat over it. There will be plenty of people around your level so you will be able to enjoy the game. 
---
I have 2 characters, one lvl 42, one 25 and I truly enjoy the game. Whatever happens, happens.
---
It has better stats while Ravager has more raw dps and a nice aoe effect (not a number cruncher from Elitist Jerks, but that's my impression)
---

The Badlands. I ran through the zones from TM to get the flight path with a random rogue, and now we're besties.
---
So you are basically saying that using prot tanks means that you can only clear MC in 10 hours MINIMUM.   
---
Please read that line one more time and reconsider your previous answer.
---
Transfer nerd
---
Woosh.
---
Yea playing with my buddy I got into it is cool. Seeing new things and going to check them out just because is something I would never do by myself.
---
That being said, watching him wand everything instead of casting spells is a little painful lol.

Undead with a human? Couple aint playing together? lol

Discord is not owned by Blizzard
---
get into a fucking guild. wtf
---
Lick my smelly butthole
---
cough, let the feral druid tank, cough.
---
Is it actually decent? The discord seems full of turds a lot of the time haha, and I've heard it's full of annoying min/max type.  
---
I was thinking about joining if it isn't that bad
---
I mean, if someone dug through this whole thread they'd be able to make a pretty comprehensive list...
---
I would not say blizzard is worse than twitch because blizzard at least has reasoning for a good majority of their bans, and will turn around false bans if you try and talk to them. 
---
Most of the people that come to reddit bitching about false ban on a blizzard game were actually acting like assholes in the game and had received multiple warnings, it's very very rare someone gets a ban for just doing something like saying "noob" or a silly random playful trash talk, or the other nonsense people SAY they get banned for.
---
Ayee, couldn‚Äôt even get to BRD for 30 min. FUN
---
Yeah I do a bit of arcanite crystal hunting since I can AFK in caves during workday, and then I run a lot of strat live/UD for gold and rep.
---
Hahaha literally me! I used to not be able to play in shattrath so I‚Äôd always hang out in Darnassus!
---
I will say as a casual who's still at level 51 questing has become damn near impossible. So many people all killing the same mobs. 
---
At least as a shadow priest it also means I don't have to worry about running out of mana between fights.
---
? 
---
Because not everyone would be so nice? Most likely the person would just ninja and hearth if possible.  SoJ is worth so much.
---
Your hard-on for classic is just laughable, classic PVE is easy as taking a piss.
---
Stormwind, the first time walking in there was definitely memorable. Coming from WC3 it was what really brought the game to life for me.
---
I get the feeling you're trying to tell us something, but I can't quite decipher your message.
---
Yes cables are so damn useful and the XL cables actually work a lot ! As a rogue it‚Äôs great to Rez the healer and make his day lol
---
Those frost rings are amazing and they aren't unique.
---
did you go to armory?
---
Start Mining / Skinning, then at 60 drop Skinning for Engineering.
---
Yeah Grobb was lit last night.
---
Change servers man
---
Currently sitting at about 400g at 54. Probably had around 150-200 at 50 so I could make roughly 50g per level just selling drops/matts on the ah and questing. 
---
Around lvl 45 I was probably hovering between 30g to 50g.
---
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be at enough for the mount when I ding 60 but I‚Äôll be probably be at around 700 myself.
---
i got this in SW last night and Got ganked going into Uldaman :((
---
So protip, since we are on the modern client where you can move these, a text file is put in your wtf folder than controls this.  However if you DC, wipe settings, or other stuff it can rewrite the file blank or with defaults.  I recommend going into your WTF folder for your character (title be obvious which file it is) and backing up the file once you have things how you want it.
---
Then if ever it resets you can go replace the file with the backup and reload ui.
---
Ty i sold mirahs song yday, thought it was rip forever.
---
I understand the purist idea, but it would be great if they implemented a voting system for retail features. Kind of like how they do it in OSRS. That way the community could decide.
---
You wanted to say something? Then you have to type it. I know it‚Äôs asking much but that‚Äôs Reddit for you.
---
Try looking into a speech to text app if your hands are to busy popping Mountain Dews and having your 5th stroke of the day.
---
40-man raids (minus Onyxia) reset every 7 days. Tuesday for NA, Wednesday for EU.
---
Onyxia is on a 5-day rolling reset. Everyone in the same region gets the same reset time.
---
20-man raids (ZG, AQ20) are on 3-day rolling resets. Same concept as Ony.
---
If you zone in a raid that's already killed a boss or kill a boss in a fresh raid instance, you'll get locked to that ID for the rest of the reset. Once locked, you can't enter any other raid ID but the one you were in.
---
Hillsbrad Foothills is my favorite place
---
Lol
---
Upper wisconsin gutterspeak, "Ope, lemme squeeze right past ya. I seen some walleye."
---
I offer 20s a stack for top level water and 1g for a portal.
---
My favourite place is Wailing Caverns. Awesome loot, fantastic quest rewards and the first time a lot of players encounter ELITE mobs. Plus while you're waiting for the rest of you party you get the enjoy Barrens chat!
---
Zandalar Tribe?
---
How much would you ask as a fee for enchanting? I got the 2H +9 intellect pattern and I just tell me to tip as much as they like, only one guy tipped me 10g so far, the rest of them from 1g to 5g.
---
When you kill the first boss of a raid, or enter the raid of a raid with bosses that are already dead. You get 'Raid ID locked' which essentially means that you can only enter the raid with the players that have the same Raid ID. If you go to your Social tab(O keybind by default) then go to Raid at the bottom then Raid info at the top right, it will show you what your Raid ID is and when it will expire. When the Raid ID expires the entire raid will be reset. Which means your Raid ID is cleared and you can kill all the bosses again.
---
You cannot enter a raid with people with a different Raid ID than yours, but people who are not locked to a Raid can join your raid and be given the same Raid ID. Raid IDs are not assigned to everyone in the raid until after a boss is killed. This is how trash farming raid groups bypass the Raid ID lock, because noone has killed a boss yet. 
---
 The idea behind Raid IDs is so that everyone is only eligible to get loot from every boss ~once per week.
---
Rolling a shadow priest before realizing they weren't allowed to do anything in raids breaks my raiding experience.
---
He's wrong.
---
seal of righteousness is not bad and always reliable, but soc will do more damage in the long run, it's also fun, paladins have simple rotations in pve and soc procs and crits kind of make the experience more exciting :)
---
sor on a 2-hander will still do more damage than a 1 hander and shield plus you get the extra white damage which will be much better as well, anyway I suggest you experiment, paladins are a very fun class to play imo, so much so that I am leveling 2 lol
---
I would just replace herbalism with tailoring and keep Eng

They were just lag fests that barely worked until the pop died down
---
Tirisfal Glades, for its myterious vibe with all the undead storylines and the Scarlet Crusade. Nostalgia is also a big factor, since is the home town of my main character.
---
Armor is nice but you only miss 4%.
---
That may be true,  but there is a guy famous for free water on our server. 
---
I love you Eureka - Incendius
---
No, it was Akama, but I am quite certain this story plays out on many, many guilds, on every server.
---
Unfortunately, I feel like I missed a golden opportunity. We had a few world-class players, and had I been up to the task, we may have added a few more. Could've been something really special tbh.
---
See if you have option for a free server transfer before making a new char.
---
Totems are so much better when they introduced the 'plop them all down at once' skill. I had fun with those. I stopped playing shaman when they removed permanent totems in retail :(
---
Get the holy water from strat, my wife said that is what helped most. It‚Äôs nice with several sources of mana, so in addition to major mana potion, feet demonic runes. We also found that if you have a hunter (me) just walking close and not doing anything it will aggro some mobs / archers and then just feign death. She did it on first try :) gl!
---
BRD.
---
Yis
---
We did doomguard roulete last night before MC. Invite 4 people to help summon, they pay 5g each. Whoever dies gets 20g. It's fun for everyone, and you get a doomguard to show off to everyone in your 40 man.
---
Thanks, I spent a lot of time drawing him in invisible ink to make sure it would show he is stealthed.
---
Followed by a bath.
---
Onyxia also deep breaths more.
---
44 is halfway point
---
People do tend to assume blue+ boe's are up for grabs so probably best to have asked but I 100% agree that they should have gone to you since you were going to use it right away.  I personally think even epics that are going to be immediately equipped should only be rolled on by those about to equip it.  The only time everyone should roll is when it's going to be sold anyways.
---
I had to argue with the person I play with about that... like you can invite leveling people to the farm because who gives a shit (it's XP for them and they don't care), but if you don't include something for the healer, you'll be lucky to get one at all.
---
It ended up in this argument about how waiting for people is what the real waste of time is. They disagreed but I stand by what I said. Sitting around in LFG hoping for a healer is asinine. You could have already gotten a few runs in by the time you find someone willing to do it for nothing!
---
Even if you spec deep Prot you shouldn't be taking anticipation.
---
I think his point is that trading gold for real life services is against ToS just like trading gold for real life money is against ToS.
---
So the person who runs the discord should atleast get their WoW account banned.
---
Yo my man
---
What server? 
---
If you need a healer and are in Fairbanks, i'll be glad to help
---
Its impressive. Youve managed to not only beat my filthy causal ass to 60 not once, but 3 times AND solved Wife Agro. 
---
You should really look into cancer research and world hunger ;)
---
well the reason why I raised to 60 is because I want a class 2 for money so I can enjoy the real love of classic wow for me twinking.
---
So am I still wrong for leveling so fast.
---
The thing is I played Star wars galaxies and that felt like four times the open world that world of Warcraft did
---
 I'm not saying that it actually is or isn't because I don't know
---
What I do know is that swg was my first MMO ever and I think that has a lot more to do with the nostalgia that people have around a leveling up.  When I was first level 60 I actually stopped at level 49 on my second character on a different server because my first one was just not that great, and I started to PVP at level 49 probably did it for almost a month and a half when everybody else was leveling to 60.
---
And that's where I've had fell in love with this game. Sure I like being in a second-tier progression group of a guild. That feels more like world of Warcraft to me as I remember because I was never in any guild that was the first of anything.
---
I never got to clear naxx in vanilla. I barely got to clear One wing. Is okay with me.
---
I don't hang out in the discord too much, and I'm sure we have some tryhards(JokerD did his first 60 run on mograine), but overall I've had a great time and I'm currently in the alliance side "boomer guild". I'm a tank though, so maybe I don't have to deal with the worst of the playerbase.
---
Actually, it does.
---
I was 60 back in the day and Im close to 60 now.
---
The other day one of these chased me to Thorium point and I just left myself be killed, but the bastard just started attacking other ppl there and when I ressed back up, it again came back beating me. In the end I was so pissed I popped all my cds and killed the mofo.
---
I would say to stay.  If you can find groups easy and the world feels populated, you'll be fine.
---
Its not just alliances its horde also. 1v1 most people just run from me but if there are 2 or 3+ horde you can rest assure they are going to try and smoke me.
---
Layering does affect server capacity.
---
Single target boss?   Assassination rogue should beat a warrior every time if he knows his rotation.
---
I have more empathy for shadow priests as they are actually reduced to being shadow weave bots. And dont tell your raid lead you could actually specc holy while keeping up shadow weave!
---
Searing Gorge/Blackrock Mountain is always full of 60s.
---
Stonetalon. One of the first PvP areas, tons of hidden nooks and crannys and can go from very peaceful and quiet to chaotic and aggressive in a second.
---
Why would blizzard care if people spend their gold on real life items? 
---
Blizzard only cares about people **making** money of buying/selling their gold.
---
How is making people pay you 100g to use discord making money off blizzards in game currency?
---
Your feelings are overriding your logic.
---
I've got 10 Gauntlets of Divinity sitting on my bag.  Where the fuck is this axe?
---
Most are former pro players
---
I actually will do this sometimes on my alts.  Even if I want to play them a little longer, just use the CD and then log on another one.
---
Should have told him to report you and open a ticket with Blizz.
---
Of course he doesn't live long, but cleaving while. The adds are alive and possible melee are MCed is a bad strat. You should never kill your raid members even if the fight lasts 5 less seconds. You want to keep their world buffs up.
---
Usable? Yes. Good? No.
---
There's a 30 debuff hard limit on mobs and bad debuffs (comparably) shouldn't be used because they'll push good ones off.
---
Is shadow wand damage actually buffed by shadow weaving?
---
I honestly almost feel like leveling as prot wouldnt be much worse lmao , I'm having fun don't get me wrong, just hit 36 and finally got whirlwind so it's great. But i have to avoid monsters above my level , because that's when the miss fest really starts. Also not having tactical mastery is depressing, but I'll just practice stance dancing a lot more later on
---
Oh stop with your physics! Geometry was just fine...
---
Thanks for the offer but Yojamba over on the oceanic servers.
---
Also, by sheer coincidence that I didn't realise until after I'd posted - [so were the two players in the original screenshot](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dls0ij/fishing_knows_no_faction_neither_does_true_love/f4ule9i/)
---
Until you get 3 crits in a row then you spike to top 3 before you get fucking murdered.
---
I want to see proof that it's higher threat generation at the current levels of gear.
---
Never said it was, not cleaving I'd also not hard. The fight is not hard because you're not cleaving adds.
---
Duskwood. Back when WOW first came out me and a buddy use to hide in a cave and sit on a mushroom. After in position we would spam /yell about finding the mushroom kings and if you defeat them you'll get a reward. We would do this for a couple hours a day some times instead of leveling.
---
Aren't 4 of the pieces epic?
---
Ayyy Ive seen this guy
---
I've tried it twice and it worked 50% of the time so far
---
I'm right there with ya, 50 and 3/4! I actually have been enjoying the game quite a bit more because I am playing more casually. Guess I also have a job and a gf to hang with, compared to part time job and no gf back in retail days
---
It pisses me off. That's why, also it's a basic human right? Have you never complained about trivial shit before?
---
More threat for the raid, more fun for the tank.
---
no u
---
This is making me nervous
---
Yeah but Resto brings literally everything you do - stronger versions too in the case of Thorns, MotW, heals, and Innervate.
---
I only ever used to end up in Darnassus if some jackass mage put up a Darnassus portal at the end of the raid, "hid" it under a SW/IF portal and I clicked the Darnassus portal. Many larks were had.
---
Gota remember its a 40 man raid dude, you take who shows up, unless its in Super duper hardcore raiding group I guarantee you that hunter is probs getting a spot haha.   
---
I think people underestimate the difficulty of collecting/hearding 40 cats in the first place and the fact that you dont even need anywhere near those numbers to clear shit.   
---
It was common bullshit in the lead up to classic that the only way to raid was min/max at all costs and bring the best possible raid set up. Thats utopia mate, u take what u get.
---
Scarlet Monastery, the lore surrounding it is wonderfully compelling.
---
Boy this was pointless, but boy was I also genuinely interested. Thanks!
---
This is my problem right now, I want to tank or dps instances, and raid as spelladin or as a healer. Finding groups just feels terrible in this position and so many people are past the pre-bis grind. I just feel lost at this point.
---
Booty Bay
---
Yoho! Yoho! A Pirates Life For Me!
---
My point was that it is somewhat min-maxing if you are trying to get this helm now and paying hundreds of gold as a crafting fee. I see value of it in BWL, not in MC, but I am talking specifically about helm not upgrades generally.
---
This is why I come to reddit.
---
No again, there is Tipsout in the audio, but those aren't "his" clips, that's just him saying stupid things. That doesn't make it his content, the same way the Mona Lisa isn't "her" content.
---
I summoned one in xr, used the stay command, got up in the tower and it killed one guy and despawned
---
People can use it to fuck with you later, that's probably why. In theory it sounds pretty solid but people joining 'reserved' runs might still refuse to accept the loot shift when it does roll around.
---
If you plan on doing some dungeon spam ravager is better because of the aoe, however if you're mostly doing quests the ww is a better choice
---
so, money item? same as krol blade.
---
anyway, who serious about twinking run the low-level stuff with a 5 man pug?
---
It‚Äòs not necessarily fewer total or regular players. Just fewer *simultaneous* players.
---
A high portion of people took a week or so off when the game released. And were more likely to play every day as opposed to maybe 2-5 times a week.
---
Why would Blizzard care if people spend gold to get real life money?
---
Thank you! I have a few epics so hopefully it's enough
---
Yeah just rechecked and edited, thanks.
---
The quickest way I can think of would be to take skinning then AOE farm cats in STV.  You should be able to level skinning fairly quickly and you will get a good amount of gold from vendoring the skins and the trash the cats drop they have some things that are 50-75 silver each.  
---
All my options involve a lot of grinding and would have required not buying unneeded spells.  IDK about mages but personally as a priest I had a ton of spells I skipped while leveling that added up to quite a bit of gold.  
---
Another couple ideas would be to aoe farm humanoids for cloth and vendor trash,  if your fishing skill is 200+ you can catch the fish people need for raid consumables, or you can take herb/alc and sell major mana pots, fire protection pots, etc.
---
The grinding method would be the best since you are still leveling so you can get xp and G at the same time.  And skinning adds an extra 1-1.5 g per 20 mobs you kill and skin.
---
Yea I'm with ya I dont know how that's possible... I've been playing tons and I'm at 57 too. I guess if he has some leveling path practiced from Private servers? But still, 3 60s is insane. Takes an average of close to 10 days /played to hit 60. Let's say it took him 8, that means hes played somewhere around 576 hours already since it came out 56 days ago. Averaging 10 hours a day. And that's not including playing with his girlfriend. Yikes.
---
You deserved that 24 hour ban that is literally a disgusting comment.
---
Based on your attitude I suspect there are other factors at play as to why people are leaving your groups.
---
We've all heard the "everybody needs gold" argument. It is straight out of the ninja looter playbook.
---
Y'all should start needing all the greens too. After all the same logic applies. Everyone needs gold. You can sell them and buy an upgrade. The whole group earned them. Oh whats that? You got kicked?
---
Duskwood. Definitely Duskwood. The ambience is on point and running into Mor‚ÄôLadim around the corner is always terrifying.
---
Too bad I can invite him. I don‚Äôt do special characters
---
Depends if a group means that the mobs are linked, or if it's the more general term just meaning any mobs in close proximity to each other..
---
Or people transferring away from servers that have 10 times too many players.
---
We are cleaving adds. In fact we even use recklessness on Luci too. No melee in our group have ever died because of MC. Cleaving adds just makes for a much faster kill.
---
For real. Desperate people shoving thousands of gold inte the buttocks of a guy who clicked 2 buttons and got drunk on the might. Just fucking make him a useless unknown speck again and leave this cancerous server instead.
---
BRILLIANT!
---
Elwynn forest of course
---
We have a shocking number of people that dont know how to play classic. There are a lot of little unspoken rules that were firmly in place for years. CC before large pulls, mark targets, need if you're going to equip, master loot if you are in a 10 man or higher. I think we have a lot of people that are really good at retail, and the mechanics side of vanilla, but havnt learned the little things yet.
---
I‚Äôd rather we kick the reserves.
---
Same, my group of friends has trailed off in the last few weeks due to the imbalance, which I suppose makes it worse. You really cant do much in the world as Alliance. As bad as it is it's going to be 10x worse when the PVP aspect of phase 2 releases.
---
None. Just watch a threat meter, it‚Äôs definitely more generation.
---
Lmao except your spell water disappears after logout. Not really saved much. Before I pay a mage money for their literal free spell I pay 15g and get to keep the water after I log out. Magetards are truly the new Hunters.
---
Westfall
---
it is better, tested it in many raids. topping charts with it. on shadowpanther it is also mentioned that it is better than bis.
---
Yup. Ya hate to see it!
---
Hell, why krol blade, when you can get quelserrar now.. Sure it's fast but you still do a lot more dps with it.
---
I wonder what the vendor price is.
---
You don't have time to move, the MC dies instantly or survives.
---
Weird...  Anytime I bid it seems to cancel the auction
---
I‚Äôve played a mage since vanilla. Raiding at 60 is pretty boring as a mage you just spam frostbolt for hours. BUT! Pvp is amazing. 
---
You have 2-3 choices for pvp specs and I‚Äôll give you a very brief pro/con. 
---
Frost: there is lots of CC and you can easily control a fight from start to finish. You have good to great survivability depending on how you play. Frost mages are low floor and decently high ceiling. This is the bread and butter of pvp mage specs. If you are someone who panics during pvp especially if getting jumped this is a great build. You can basically reset the fight with a well timed ice block and sheep. 
---
PoM/Pyro: If you look up glass cannon in the dictionary this is it. Every 3 mins you will absolutely face melt and or one shot any class. This is a very volatile play style. It‚Äôs a high risk high reward spec. I ran this for a bit in vanilla and it‚Äôs pretty damn fun especially in a group setting. There are many mages who can do well even when your main moves are on Cooldown but I just didn‚Äôt enjoy it. 
---
Fire: I only played this spec a little and I think it was at 70-80 tbh. I never played it in vanilla since you cannot raid as fire ‚Äúif they catch you ;)‚Äù. I know a bit about it but I‚Äôll defer to someone else. It‚Äôs a viable build and can be very deadly. High crits and extreme burst. High floor and high ceiling build. 
---
Elemental: saved the best for last. I absolutely love this spec more than any other spec I‚Äôve played on almost any character. I honestly thought it was obscure but it‚Äôs on icyveins as a main pvp spec. This is a medium to high floor and high ceiling spec. Don‚Äôt be discouraged if it takes you a bit to figure out the synergy of flowing between frost and fire. The survival is all in the synergy. Keeping enemies just out of range with a combo of slows and cc. The dps is very burst friendly. Your damage will feel like chip shots until you land a few quick crits and then they are dead. This works amazing in both group and solo pvp. 
---
It‚Äôs extremely fun and if you are sneaky you can even raid in this spec. 
---
Arcane: the frost pve of pvp. It‚Äôs boring and bad.
---
Who would want to pad out someone else's meter? I've seen warlocks use agony on bosses even with 2 mages in the grp.
---
Some tanks do yes.  We don't seem to need to though - https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/CXHgm1N8tFB327Yq/#fight=30&amp;type=damage-taken
---
It must have some effect on queue times. Bigglesworth hasn't had a queue for a few weeks, and last night there was a queue.
---
That pvp though.
---
I didn't say quests were designed for this much competition. I've even said on launch month that I was for increasing spawn rates to match the new playerbase. But classic is very #Nochanges so like I said dont expect this to be "fixed"
---
Go one better. Single stack of everything different so he can't stack anything in his bags.

Damn that is a feels bad man
---
I was just answering the guys question chief, he asked why people run it. Plus fury prot is going to be more threat than a Druid anyway.
---
There is no point in arguing it. They have it stuck in their head that every item is an upgrade for everyone even if the only benefit to them is gold so they can purchase overpriced gear (because the game economy is somewhat still new) off the AH.
---
This is literally your own fault.
---
Once I had an idea to write a script that fills their DB with some random emails and passwords.
---
You know, just for fun.
---
Full runs/quest runs can take arbitrarily long, make sure you have like 3 hours to spare.
---
Arena+angerforge runs should take like 15 minutes or less but you're expected to do multiples of them.
---
Emperor runs can either go the long route through angerforge-&gt;golemlord-&gt;guzzler-&gt;flamelash-&gt;7 dwarves-&gt;magmus-&gt;emperor, or skip most of it by swimming through lava. I'd say 1h for former and 30 min for latter with an efficient party, but could be longer if you're having issues.

I‚Äôm not really sure whah you‚Äôre asking here, but it doesn‚Äôt sound like a good idea, and it definitely doesn‚Äôt work in the context of my strategy.

I think all scams are in some way your own fault, that doesn't make them okay.
---
To be fair, if the target is sitting the first hit always crits. But that's the best time to rock a mage, when they resting.
---
Dude Hesoyam - isnt that a GTA San Andreas cheat code? :D
---
I have actually been really getting frustrated with my guild because many of them do not have this mentality. One of our strongest DPS for trash packs is actually an ele shaman, he tops the charts for nearly every trash pull while the mages and warlocks are all afk on their phones. 
---
I even saw myself (Enhance shaman) as #10 on the dps slot for lucifron the other night, and tanked two trash mobs when for some crazy reason all 3 of our tanks died. 
---
Sure, I'm not number 5, and *overall damage*, I know I am still going to be pulling in low because those longer fights I am a wet noodle... But that's because I am there for my utility. Everyone seems to forget the 140 attack power and windfury those warriors are getting, plus the 60 fire resist the melee group *apparently desperately needs because why the fuck do we not have GFPPS guys?!?!?!*
---
If it's a pain then transfer to a lower pop realm then.

Lupine's shadow damage was patched out in 1.9, so it makes sense that we don't get it in 1.12+. I've heard other stuff got normalized, but I don't have a source explaining the exact differences.
---
Pet attack speed was not normalized. Brokentooth still keeps their insane 1 second attack speed while other cats may have a 2 second speed.
---
I‚Äôm in a guild.

Same same there. You have the MT/OT running with their core of people. And a bunch of leather warriors who don‚Äôt want to roll for it.

I'd say re roll to a higher pop server for sure; your server will likely just get worse as more ppl reroll to higher pop servers as well. Definitely use a leveling guide tho. I rerolled for the same reason and with a leveling guide I was able to get to level 10 in about an hour and 15 mins. Then from about level 15 -25 I was averaging about an hour a level; some levels being hour 30 mins due to massive quest drop grinding and bad drop RNG, other levels being 20mins because you'd ding, then the guide would tell you to turn the 12 quests you just grinded out and you'd almost ding again just from that. From level 25 - 20 was about and hour and 30 mins per level on average and then at 30 that jumped up huge to about 2:15 a level; however, I also started to slow my pace myself and do some side stuff.
---
Jamie pull that shit up

Hoj also gives 20 ap

It has to be Scarlet Monastery

everyone except those who are banned
---
Warrior doesn't scale with ana consumables unlike feral (more mana - more powershifts) and you can\`t "make' your rotation more complex. Even if you tryhard and Overpower on every dodge - it\`s still not that complex.
---
The Auctionhouse....badum *tsss*
---
Maybe, but got it first run last night. That's ok, don't want to get everything to quickly, else what are we supposed to do!
---
Minimal uses really.  While leveling you probably wont be using Hellfire/RoF too much and you're only using immolate with the rest shadow dmg, so Firestone is not really super useful.   Spellstone dmg absorb may be nice while leveling, but you get the spell at 36 which is about the time you also can get the Offhand from SM and i would take the spellpower over crit, especially at low level.
---
At max level, I am not sure if Spellstone is used for pvp, but a quest reward offhand is better than the 1% crit, so you wont be using it for PVE.  Firestone only gives 21 fire dmg, the quest offhand is 20 spell power for all schools.
---
So here's what I did. I made sure I had the proper down ranks hn3, flash 4, and then  disease. I had immolation pots, and also 14 holy waters collected up. 
---
I used the first try to make sure my ui was set properly and I could see everything. Topped everyone up below 50% flash heal, anyone else I'd hit with a renew. Mana pots, and runes are your friends, eat some nightfin as well. 
---
Even though I was testing everything on my first try to get a real attempt I ended up completing it. Didn't lose to many  adds.  I used the immolation to test, and 2 holy waters just because they were on my bar.  
---
  It's fairly straight forward and super easy imo. It's just having the right down ranks to barely skirt by. I highly recommend grabbing a mage for ai before going.
---
I'll check them out :)
---
By coincidence, it's also strongly reminiscent of the most [famous scene from the movie "Ghost"](https://youtu.be/HvyCMgAajqk?t=62)
---
You're right, 4/8 are epic.
---
as a human combat sword spec it is better.... by a lot. check shadowpanther. 
---
use striking on weapons instead of crusader, you should'nt rely on procs.. has noone said ever.
---
I think everyone agrees that when you are in a group with a mage and use mana, the water from that mage should be free. 
---
If however a mage is doing his shit and gets whispered for water, it is reasonable to pay him for the service.
---
Reserving dark runes sound like a dick move though. They are basically healer resources, which have just as much problems farming for gold as tanks, but don't get easy group invites anymore.
---
&gt;spread his shady name across the server 
---
that's kind of what this thread is
---
Lol your 100% the type of person who would \*report\* guildies to the GM over the slightest issue that you conjure up in your brain. Thank god your not in my guild haha
---
Seen two people roll 100 for the same item. That would be worse at least?

Ayeee fellow ket fam!

I really took time during Classic to explore the Hinterlands. The atmosphere is so nice.
---
Sadly, blizzard's 'report a player' ticket option doesnt work for me in my Chrome or Firefox (without addons) - the server list is just empty and I can't click submit.
---
I agree!
---
Nah I have way more issues with hunter than mages. Hunters cry about every piece of loot. They ditch parties halfway through when they didnt get their drop. They tab pull because F key is so hard to use. They don't manage their pet when trekking. They start dps before the tank even gets a hit off. Mages at least have cc to negate their mistakes, which while making bad habits, isn't nearly as annoying as a hunter causing massive wipes.
---
What guild? Lol
---
I think the fix for pets was to make it so they couldn't get the debuf at all.
---
&gt;  This is just straight up a dick move, and I'm not sure why someone would even do it to begin with. 
---
The idea behind it is that they are selling the same item, and by having you COD it to them - then never paying for it - you keep that item off the market for 3 days to remove competition.
---
I main a feral druid.  The spec you linked is like 95% of the same talents as the well known DPS/Tank spec found here: "https://classicwow.live/guides/22/treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla#tank_and_dps_build"
---
I do a lot of tanking so I took 5 points of out of Feral Aggression and put it into Feral Instinct.    Its a good spec that allows me to tank raids/dungeons and I can keep up with most classes on single target.  It took my awhile to really learn how to powershift well and keep it going for for several "rotations" without messing it up.  Its fun and engaging.
---
Well, fuck, I cannot deny you absolutely have me there
---
I find your point compelling
---
Well, there would be issue of pace - at 47 you'll pull substantially more mobs than your groupmates meaning the instance would take longer. The second consideration would be your tank's gear, if he isn't overgeared I would be concerned. Ultimately, could you? Probably. Should you? Probably not.
---
I wasn't allowed to use pets in raids. I didn't make a mistake or anything... just "no pets".
---
Tauren arms warrior, 54. Recently got a dirt cheap Twig of the world tree, which is quite a bit better than my gatorbite axe - but losing out on axe mastery. 
---
Is there any weapon in the near future which would be even better than the twig? As in, should I sell the twig instead of using it for 1-2 level?
---
49 maybe.
---
Few errors.
---
Buff is 10% spell crit, 140 AP and 5% ranged/melee crit. Duration is 120 minutes.
---
Buff CD is 6 hours after turn in so most raid guilds just have to go without it unless you log in at least 2 hours early (preferbly the evening before raid) and get your buffs then log off. You'll never be able to turn in the buffs if you raid starts between 7-8 PM sun-thursday.
---
Hunter is the fastest leveling class and ticks all your boxes. Mage would be a good 2nd depending on your play style.
---
I thought this was a really smart QoL change. It also kept people from needing on greens to sell on the AH.
---
Not all pets come with skills.
---
This particular one was Sulfuras. Our layering went away last night, and this was pretty much the entire servers raid time.
---
Kromcrush?

Now he can experience the HUGE part of classic maybe once if ever, time to put the pitchfork away

Isn't that when they stop farming it...
---
I never use it cause it's cancer
---
When you bop a main tank the threat goes to the 2nd highest which should be the offtank in phase 1. This is nothing new but no one ever does it as they just pray the offtank isn't bad at the game and can build threat to keep above mages who can not drop threat (wanding p1 for a reason), or ret pally if you have one. All is does is feeds the offtank more rage since he becomes the main tank, the new off tank has already spent ages building threat so on immune to taunt bosses like onyxia this is one way to enforce a tank swap. Mages pulling agro is the problem during phase 2 even tho they spent most of p1 wanding. So all you have is phase 1 for tanks to shine, if they can't do that then mages need to iceblock and afk at start of p2 if they get agro and aim boss away from raid...
---
Theoretically yes, realistically you'll have a hard time finding groups that would take a 47, and you will also pull packs along the way with your aggro range while 60s (or near 60s) can get to the arena without killing a single mob.
---
Blizzard has always refunded me my COD‚Äôs he‚Äôd in ransom or excess time.

At the beginning of BFA I had to ticket for this multiple times.

Ironforge!

It‚Äôs pretty good for PvE and just really good to have if you get ganked in world PvP

Unique items are also in the game.

WInterspring. I think it's super calming, and it's also where I hit 60 in actual vanilla, and now in classic wow.
---
Yes it's the right thing to do. They can fuck off.
---
As a Healer your best bet is to farm Herbs/Ore.
---
Most guilds are chill, We have cleared all the content and have it all on farm and we haven't even had a raised voice in a raid yet. Beyond a "YES!" when an item dropped. 
---
Then again we are a pretty chill bunch of dudes and dudettes
---
yea this go round im gonna try a guide out. do you have the one you used?
---
This ^ got my epic mount from nothing in a few long grinding sessions doing lashers

There's a place toward the front that you get caught on while running into the statue. You can jump+forward onto that spot and then again onto the head.
---
The Hinterlands! Lots of memories from at the end of vanilla/beginning of BC, but for some reason I have lots there leveling with two people from my old guild!
---
Maybe elixir of the sages as well as the ones Ser Dansksalot mentioned.
---
I don‚Äôt know what potato group you‚Äôre raiding in buddy but over our 6 weeks of MC Logs we‚Äôve had 1 MC death because he sat in it for 6 seconds. And he only took damage from one rogues blade flurry and one mage over that time. It‚Äôs like every other dps noticed he was MC‚Äôd and played accordingly.
---
I want to believe your assertion on player count but it's hard without some numbers.
---
"Someone" in this case would be Blizzard.
---
... threat isn't an issue on the alliance exclusively, not sure how you got that from me saying that paladins have an easier time keeping tanks up than other healers.
---
Top guilds have their DPS attack literally right after the tank pulls, because the tank is usually fury tanking and has good threat gen. I have never had to wait for aggro, even on onyxia. Maybe learn a bit about the game (and how to read) before you leave dumb ass comments lmao.
---
I duo'd Jadenar with a random hunter (i'm a warlock) and Hurricane bow dropped.  I asked if he was going to use it, he said yes, I fucking passed, he equipped it.  Don't be a douche wagon and let people have the BoE's they need.  Take your toxicity out on the other faction.
---
Somtimes you don't learn until you've completely embarassed yourself
---
It'll carry you to p6 and naxx
---
What other exceptions would there be? You‚Äôre making it seem complicated when it doesn‚Äôt have to be at all. Also, what‚Äôs the point of creating a LFG tool if you don‚Äôt include everything, high or low level? The spirit of making this addon was probably to get his hands dirty with some cool code, why take the lazy out instead of making your code handle a difficult case like this?

The gold really is more valuable, dude. Even if you win and it's an upgrade.

Gnomeregan...

Everyone haves it but it was the first dungeon I remember really loving. It has such a unique design and all the mechanical stuff makes me feel like I'm in a vastly different Era. I only played horde so it was a very new feeling to be killing "alliance" npcs for the first time. Also it has the first important boss mechanics that I can remember (bombs on final boss).
---
I see your point but completely disagree with it. If that item is a clear upgrade for me and even if I use it only for 2 weeks - I dont see myself as sabotaging myself.   
---
I would definitely think that you are a twat and would avoid ever grouping with you again, but I would not do anything besides that because its a game and I couldnt be bother with wasting my time :P
---
cranky
---
Wailing Caverns will always be my favorite. They challenge low levels so early with a dungeon where you may get lost in, and the bosses have a great story line.
---
One way to avoid the DM issue is to filter on the level of the sender. I'll never be running Dire Maul with a level 19.
---
Fuck tips.
---
Stonetalon or hillsbrad.  Really any 20-30 zone should work.  
---
I didn‚Äôt think the STV tournament was in Classic yet?  Strategies will be widely different based on whether you‚Äôre on a pvp or pve server, but generally, you will be fishing pools and trying to keep your line in the water as much as possible, so any and all speed boosts between pools should be used.  If I remember correctly, where you set your hearth also came into play but I don‚Äôt recall whether it was more important to set it to BB or one of the major cities (for some reason I seem to remember having to hearth back to stormwind for a turn-in, but I could be mistaken).
---
What service is his stopping you from using?

Is setting a 100g entry fee to join my guild against ToS?  Because technically my guild is a service to help people acquire gear, so?
---
Nothing is stopping you from acquiring the service for free... if you want access to his guilds/groups discord either follow the rules or make your own.
---
No, it's because everyone else realises that 500g is worth more to people than an item replaced within a few levels.
---
&gt; Tauren can‚Äôt be rogue. Every race except tauren can. Every race except tauren, therefore, has the capacity for being dicks.
---
Tauren are the sneakiest rogues... that's why you never see one, but your point still stands because all they do is tickle people from stealth with a feather from their headdress.
---
My favorite place in Classic WoW is Blackrock Mountain, because I have so many memories of encounters with the opposite faction there trying to get a full 40-man raid into Molten Core or Blackwing Lair.
---
I haven‚Äôt seen horde spam that in a while, it was quite popular for a while when they ganked in groups.
---
At end game maybe since blackrock mountain convenient, but from a leveling perspective horde has hay better flightpoint basically everywhere including the alliance continent. We don't have a point in swamp of sorrows, or Badlands, only booty bay in stranglethorn, none in thousand needles, feathermoon is a long swim, etc.
---
moonglade. so serene and chill.
---
Ahhhh, classic Barlow. Love it.
---
I will use tiger's fury whenever I'm attacking lower level mobs as you are more likely to connect with auto attacks.
---
Whenever I use tiger's fury and miss auto attacks, it just feels like wasted energy.
---
that would send the axe back then too, which solves the issue
---
Yes and no. I mean, in theory it's a class that doesn't really have a serious niche since fury warriors are so good, but there's also an element of misconception in there: warriors, unless they rank up all the way to the epic PvP sets, have dogshit for gear in the first half of vanilla. If you're not someone who can take on the monstrous task of getting to R13+, playing a fury warrior becomes miserable when all the rogues finish up their tier sets while you're still in mostly pre-bis. It's not until AQ40 that warriors can really assemble a serious DPS set from PvE. As such, if you want to play melee DPS and don't have 12h/day to grind honor for a few months, rogue may be the right choice.
---
When people talk about warriors topping the meters, they mostly mean either the early stages where everyone's in blues, or the warriors who ranked up. If you were to look at, say, mid-BWL progression for any given guild, it's very likely that there are more rogues in the top 10 DPS than warriors. While there are some pieces of good fury gear along the way (e.g. Onslaught Girdle, Chromatic Boots), these items are *way* more rare than tier pieces which every boss drops 1-2 of every time. It's pretty unrealistic to expect a warrior to get all of these choice items, especially since they're also highly desired by tanks for threat sets, whereas a rogue will have most/all of their tier set after a few months of raiding.
---
If you can have all the items you want, warrior is better. For most players, that's just not reality. Rogue is the right choice for those who aren't hardcore rankers, guild leaders, or streamers who gets fed all the loot by their fanboy guilds.
---
Literally never used the one on my server, I see no need for it when I can join LookingForGroup to look for a group, and go to a city and post in /2 when I want to trade something.
---
It seems like a channel that tries to fix a problem that doesn't actually exist.
---
Aight thanks, will do!  
---
I will also get your dragon frames, I miss these guys
---
Wait. Were you actually going to use edgemasters as a shaman if you won the roll?
---
There's a fuck-ton of horde on Skeram.
---
My favorite place has been the Stormwind entrance with the music playing loudly
---
This ^
---
So the best guide is joanas, however, that dbag implemented a pay wall at like level 15 ish. It's like 5 or 10 bucks. After that I found a guide called judgments guide. It is literally exactly the same as joanas but free. However, judgements guide is alliance only. The saving grace is that I was able to find free old vanilla versions of joanas horde leveling guide online posted by others on forums and such.
---
ohh so you are in a scrub guild using shit fury tanks for no reason.  gotcha
---
Damn, noted, thanks mate.
---
I did it in Booty Bay.
---
Hehehe
---
what?
---
I do believe for Onyxia at least you get locked on engage. This is to prevent people leaving before the kill and thus do more than one ony per week. Some pserver guilds did this to maximize loot for a select few multiple times.
---
But mc might still be on kill.
---
Getting phase 3 out sooner will be our job. i dont know about you but I will be multibox camping flight paths all day. If I can get a group of people to ensure that every alliance flight path 50+ is camped and no one can play the game then blizzard is going to be forced to give us battlegrounds.
---
This game will be 100% unplayable for the minority faction on your server for the entirety of p2
---
on a server like gehennas /world has ten times the traffic of /lfg
---
You will likely aggro all the mobs on the way to to the jump including arena spectators, so most groups will not take you so as to be more efficient.
---
It‚Äôs funny I just watched this, random af and love the series now.
---
Ice Shards's tooltip says +100% crit damage but it's actually +33%. What it actually does is raise the crit dmg bonus multiplier up to 100% from 50%. You can test this in game by looking at the damage values when hitting a mob. 
---
Regular hit - 100% dmg
---
Crit without ice shards - 150% dmg
---
Crit with ice shards - 200% dmg
---
This comes down to a 33% observed increase in crit damage for 5/5 ice shards.  
---
Comparison between ice shards vs shatter for CoC use:
---
Assuming 15% base crit chance of spells.
---
\-Ice shards will give 33\*0.15=5% dmg increase 
---
\-Shatter will give 50\*0.5=25% dmg increase
---
Which is exactly why everyone needs. Had that happen to me and now we need all BOE purples but this shithole sub would call me a ninja, even though I let a guy that rolled greed get the item. People who decide to all roll need just don't want to get screwed over, so why would I screw that person over for no reason?
---
If a person really wants to equip something they need I'd give it to em too.
---
Keep in mind Skeram is a high pop server, and it‚Äôs around 75/25 H/A. So there‚Äôs going to be about twice as many people as they‚Äôre should be on a 50/50 sever.
---
I would argue that even then if it is an upgrade for a class, then they can need.
---
Herod was like this on multiple layers last night.
---
For me it's been 20-30 min per winterfall intrusion. Longer if other people are grinding to level, farming fire water, or just pvping. Once you get to 1500/3000 neutral (30 starter quests) and start doing winterfall intrusion, if you can manage to do 9 quests a day (~3.5 hours) for 3 months, you'll get the mount. That means If you're more casual and only have time to do 1 quest a day, it will take ~2 years.
---
Just commenting to save this for later. I definitely need something like this
---
Yea and shit like this to deal with.
---
No thank you
---
Phew, a few things to talk about here.
---
1. Hit% is crucial for DW and really good for tanking too, this you are correct.
---
2. If you're pushing late 40's it's *really* time to start wearing plate if you're tanking. You're in the armor range where every point of armor contributes *a lot* to your physical mitigation.
---
3. If you're tanking while DW'ing AND you're wearing SM mail? You're giving your healers heart attacks - please stop.
---
4. While point #1 stands true, only 1% hit is beans. So while you're crippling your mitigation and requiring a ridiculous amount of healing to keep up, you aren't even helping yourself in a meaningful way.
---
Ditch the set asap, and get some plate on. And unless you really like the play style you should stop DW'ing, it's trash until you get 3-4% hit and not even good until you're at 6%+. 2H fury is a good spec if you really don't want to go Arms, and has much more lenient hit% requirements  - as in it's functional without any and you won't be getting any outside of Blackstone Ring until you're 58-60.
---
So, you‚Äôd rather use a weapon for 2 weeks than get multiple hundreds of gold if its worth that much which will go towards your epic mount and a lot more things which you will use a lot more than that weapon?
---
&gt; It's because all of the other healing classes can't heal end game off spec.
---
I'd argue that a HotW NS spec'd feral can heal just fine with proper gear. 20% extra int isn't anything to scoff at.
---
No need for the snark, I think niche/janky abilities like this are also important at making the world feel deeper and more immersive (a "real" virtual world as opposed to a strictly regulated playground like retail). Warlocks being able to kill themselves in many different ways is part of what makes them an interesting class and it totally fits the lore surrounding Warlocks.
---
The funny thing is a lot of the pservers got more consequential stuff quite wrong, but we're at a point where a large portion of the community has nostalgia for that version of the game and not actual vanilla. 
---
People are definitely very confused about what actually makes vanilla special. I'll give you a hint: it's not all the small tedious shit. The people bitching about the clock being on the minimap are lunatics. 
---
If you make an MMO where the game world has value, you're forced to participate in a server community, and you have very clear goals, chances are high you're going to have something compelling. 
---
Blizzard has massively compromised on all three of those pillars. That's the biggest problem with WoW. If you fixed those things, people wouldn't care about the quality of life stuff or maintaining the laughable class balance.
---
"Heals didn't land as Tanks died in Vanilla"
---
- Someone who clearly didn't Heal or Tank in Vanilla
---
On my server it started at 200. Yea you'll get more customers for lower price, but reducing the fee from 200 to 100 is unlikely to double it, considering the mats still make up the bulk of the price.
---
Scarlet Monastery - brings back the most memories from vanilla

Look us up on WCL shitter, sorry your guild is as terrible as your game knowledge lul
---
The worst one I've seen so far is probably "killerrouge"
---
not only is it the extremely unoriginal combo of "killer" and "rogue", but it also has the classic misspelling of "rogue -&gt; rouge"
---
**GAH**
---
So people's time isn't worth anything? Stopping random people and expecting them to do things for free for you is just rude as fuck.
---
Paul Rudd is a treasure of a human being.

you can do it with barely pre-BIS gear
---
Instead of thorns, buy oil of immolation and/or farm holy water from strat.

So efficient to level multiple alts at once. Not only do you get more rested, but you save run time by endlessly using hearthstone
---
My toon is lvl 51 with 3d 12h, enjoying the solo questing for once and not doing any dungeons

I tried to login with my account but it didn‚Äôt work?

Does it work for you?
---
I have been shocked herding on my mage 20-40 that most others got along.  Only two of over a dozen total players doing the same have been rude.
---
Offensive in my case. I‚Äôve already got them targeting with my finger on my charge key. Waiting... look at me one time mofo and see what happens. I dare you. I double dare you! I triple dog dare you!
---
Onyxia‚Äôs lair
---
You get to do an epic long questline just to be Able to step foot in the cave and it brings back some great memories of being in the dorms of college. First kill my guild had back then I was surrounded by a dozen or so other wow players from the dorms watching my screen and cheering when she went down
---
should have reserved it lul
---
Stormwind by far. I'm not a big fan of current Stormwind in retail, and finally arriving in Stormwind on classic launch felt like coming home.
---
For anyone wondering: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWVHses2GCY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWVHses2GCY)
---
It's one of their best episodes ever!
---
I feel much better now about the 6g I paid recently.
---
Bear in mind that armor reduces damage.  Tigers fury +damage is built into 6-7 total attacks, so the 'top end' is reduced every time by armor. 
---
Claw is a larger spike of damage, and reduced a little less overall. 
---
IMO the best feral DPS while leveling (especially vs higher armor targets like beasts or humanoids w/shields) is to open pounce-rake-rip and utliize bleeds.  bleeds are unaffected by armor so you get "True damage" instead of 20-40% reduce based on armor.  
---
I've been running a damage meter and the pounce/rake/rip is definitely best DPS against high armor targets, BUT you lose out on getting nice crits from claw/ravage or fero bite so once you get close to 20% crit on gear (closer to 60 perhaps) the bleeds don't scale, so the burst attacks will become more powerful.
---
I did the math the other day because I looked it up for a long time and got a ton of mixed answers. I can confirm that both Shadowform and Shadow Weaving increase shadow wand damage.
---
Thalnos too, I think.
---
&gt;Gota remember its a 40 man raid dude, you take who shows up, unless its in Super duper hardcore raiding group I guarantee you that hunter is probs getting a spot haha.
---
I can understand this at like... way in the early weeks of classic, but Nightfall isn't out until P3. We're barely trying and we can easily fill a 40man and have people left over. 
---
&gt;It was common bullshit in the lead up to classic that the only way to raid was min/max at all costs and bring the best possible raid set up. 
---
Not the only way; just the most effective one.
---
&gt; Queue time dropping from 10k to none since release is a indication of  less ~~players~~ time in-game per player.
---
FTFY
---
It has a melee on hit component, but it also has fire spell power.
---
So swap to plate, instead of relying on flurry/crits for threat, go back to sunder spamming until I build up more hit%?
---
Happened to me back in vanilla.  I had a druid and I wanted that mount so bad.  I used to run strat all the time.  Finally dropped and lost the roll. Feels bad man.
---
Forth this
---
I'm in the same boat. Can't get into dungeon groups, not needed in my guilds raid groups. Seems like the last 2 months were a waste of time.
---
Searing Gorge - This is the first zone encountered that really gives me a feel for the end game content in Black Rock Mountain! It just feels so epic walking into this zone for the first time.
---
engineer &gt;&gt; both factions for guild v guild pvp. sapper charges are everything that is used during those, afterwards its just cleanup for the side that prepared the better position
---
So you have no proof two layers resulted in 2x longer spawn times?
---
funny thing happened last night in Ironforge... I had 2 stacks of lvl55 water left when I was about to go offline, so I asked in front of the bank of IF "/say some good water anyone?" not wanting to waste all of the good stuff.  
---
3 sec. later a 60 mage pulled up next to my sorry level 58 ass and started casting "conjure water" without saying anything - didn't take long to clear up that misunderstanding... but God bless his soul.
---
Feralas!
---
Firestone is for ganking lowbies. Getting killed by a melee warlock is far more humiliating
---
He didn't badmouth anyone, he just showed a stream and pointed out stuff in an objective way.
---
Duskwood i love the creepy wooded atmosphere plus the great stories and quests.
---
It's easy to tell by your comments that your knowledge of hunter dps is shallow and meme-y.
---
As a warrior tank MT/OT at phase 1 now I love my bears because in situations like the imps before Lucy or generally aoe trash the are far superior. They were designed that way to complement certain tanking pulls while warriors were always intended to be superior single target tanks.
---
Definitely Duskwood.  The whole vibe of the zone feels like how I imagine every "Normal" town and country vibe of WoW.
---
Goldshire Inn. 
---
What happens in Goldshire, stays in Goldshire.
---
Blackrock Mountain, what I hated in vanilla is what I love in classic.  Mostly just all the good (and sometimes agonizing) memories of going to/from raids and dungeons in a simpler time of life.
---
2 Orbs are needed for a Crusader enchant so that's reasonable.
---
Layering has never increased server capacity. You'll have the same queue whether or not there is any layering on a server.
---
Blackrock mountain. Just a cool dungeon entrance setup that's usually filled with players.
---
Given how difficult it is to activate and then deactivate heroic strike to get the "bonus hit" from it, yet not lose all that rage, you often end up missing bloodthirsts and/or whirlwinds, which will lower your dps overall compared to if you played normally. If you happen to be able to juggle all of this well, all power to you, but for us mere mortals, it's best (for now) to just get some more hit and use a normal rotation.
---
That said, with sufficient gear, you could get to the point where your offhand hits provide sufficient rage to keep heroic strike/cleave toggled permanently...
---
&gt;So the person who runs the discord should atleast get their WoW account banned.
---
Well that solely depends on if someone actually paid up. Which i think would be very stupid thing to do.
---
Being on the ball with Distract on patrols can save a wipe before it happens
---
Stanglethorn Vale, love the jungle and its beasts.

Pretty sure that was it. I'm not at my computer to double check, but I'm pretty sure.
---
It's addicting (to me) though, already interfering with my chores and real life.
---
Unfortunately it's not something I can do in moderation.
---
HoJ is insanely good and what makes it so powerful is that it scales super well with gear - the more powerful the rest of your gear, the more powerful its proc.
---
Start your own
---
I get the feeling this is how you imagine it is running with a hunter, and not actual experiences.
---
1. The most loot horny class in wow classic is warriors. They want leather, mail, plate, 1h,2h and ranged weapon. And they don‚Äôt want to roll for it.
---
2. A whole class can‚Äôt ditch their group when they did not get their loot. That‚Äôs a person doing this. Not hunters.
---
3. Same as above.
---
4. Same as above.
---
5. Same as above.
---
6. If a hunter pulls aggro they have the tools to cc. I either wingclip and run the mob back to the tank or disengage and the mob goes back to the person next on aggro. Or fein death &gt; send pet for aggro &gt; send pet back to tank.
---
Hey thanks for the info it's really helpful!
---
I actually decided to get skinning yesterday and no i have it at 200 and i've been farming the worgens in Duskwood. 
---
I'll give the cats a try tomorrow though, thanks a bunch!
---
Context: I am levelling main now which is a dwarf paladin (and enjoying it). I am now speccing protection and tanking instances but Since in classic they dont have a taunt abilities it will not be viable to do this in endgame raids.
---
I also can only play during weekends because I travel for work during the week, so it‚Äôs unrealistic that I will have multiple max-level chars. My question is: is it worth continuing with pally knowing that I wont be able to tank endgame (so I‚Äôll probably have to switch to healing) or would it be better to switch to another class for main e.g. warrior?
---
All need on boe blues or higher. End of story.
---
Yeah it can be done casually, but it will take years...
---
This meme could also be about Voidwalkers lmao
---
Ironforge, the coziest city in all of Azeroth.
---
I sent some expensive mats to someone who begged me to reduce my price. I did and sent them cod....two weeks ago and nada
---
and gnomer isn't even hard, horde can teleport to a spot about 200 yards away from the instance portal.
---
There's a 1h+offhand combo that beats it in phase 3 when you're shadow, but yeah for a healer it does
---
Yea you don't know how to read buddy. What I said was alliance don't have issues keeping a DW fury tank up because we have paladins, not that we don't have threat issues. 
---
But ye, a server first guild with the 9th fastest ony kill in the world isnt good enough for a top tier player like yourself clearly.
---
Lets say the item is worth 300g. Not huge, but a pretty large sum. You could use that to level 2 professions to 300 from 0. You could use that to buy 5 equipment upgrades on the ah for slots with less frequent equip drops. You could use it to buy tons of stat buffing potions that give vastly more stats than that "upgrade" and you'll still have 150g left after the two weeks when you would replace it if you'd taken the weapon instead.
---
I'll go back to my previous analogy. Yes, playing with that super valuable unboxed toy might be fun. It even might be fun for a relatovely long while. But i guarantee you could have equivalent fun, for longer, by selling that vanity piece and buying a ton of anything else with the profits.
---
If you look at the top 95% of each class a feral is not catching a mage. Shedo does outstanding for a feral, but you are not comparing apples to apples saying he out DPSes mages and has a chance of catching equal tryhard warriors and rogues.
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/rankings/1000#region=6&amp;subregion=13&amp;metric=bossdps
---
Didn't dude literally say not to go fury tank before like p3 or something?
---
Can't really blame him for that.
---
I agree with you, except for the ‚Äúnot fooling anybody‚Äù. Cause it‚Äôs apparently worked on 1.2k people.
---
Not saying the person you replied to was correct, but you're definetly wrong too. Classic has layering (is in the process of being removed slowly prior to phase 2). It's basically sharding, but continent wide.
---
They are amazing currently, PvP they are great. PvE Im pretty sure they get replaced in BWL.
---
When is the agreed upon time?
---
Blessing of Protection?
---
Exactly what I do. I always saw the Zep to "Grom'Gol", wherever the fuck that was, and just ignored it. Once I actually hit 36-ish, got to Grom'Gol and saw the zeppelins there, I had the biggest "Oh. OH." reaction so far, hahaha. 
---
Hearthing to an inn 15 seconds away from the zeppelins to both UC and Org, and a short flight away from Badlands, is the best. No more hearthing to some random place like Tarren Mill and realizing you have to take like two flights and a Zeppelin to get to that quest you forgot to turn in in Desolace, (mostly) everywhere is very fast to reach. Now if only the Orgrimmar zep went straight to TB instead, I'd be in heaven.
---
"rip-off" vs "inspired by"
---
I see these as "inspired by" more than "rip-offs". The author likely really liked the addon and the addon either stopped being supported or the current addon author didn't want to add additional features that someone wanted. So, they put in the effort to enhance or recreate what was previously made and made it their own.
---
Hey man I get it. Sometimes you just want to beat the hell out of things without having the group's survival on (one of) your shoulders.
---
I‚Äôm on anethema horde as well and honestly haven‚Äôt had any problem finding groups or with world pvp the world doesn‚Äôt feel super empty. It almost always ‚Äúmedium‚Äù I‚Äôm in the same boat as you 44 irc hunter. I‚Äôm sticking it out on anathema I think it‚Äôll fill but in the near future
---
ITT: Bad players try to replicate good players, video reviewer shits on bad players for trying to replicate good players because he doesn‚Äôt understand what good players are doing and Reddit doesn‚Äôt understand either

The river east of Tarren Mill. Great place to level fishing, and you won't get bored because warriors will do anything for help with their whirly axe quest.

That makes more sense.

---
I don't have to read your shit article, because I am actually informed. I know what happened in 2015-16, because I didn't get my info cable "news".
---
How do I recruit guild members? 
---
I am a Co-GM for &lt;Limit Break&gt; on Herod-H. Guild is hovering around 60 members mostly still leveling. The aim is to get more members in the 50-60 range for 5 mans then some casual raiding. But the only way I know to recruit is to /who people with no guild and whisper pick up lines. Usually I get ignored but its how I got all  60 so far.
---
Layering has never increased server capacity. You'll have the same queue whether or not the server is layered.
---
Or smash and bash
---
FWIW, the NA realms listed here still said 'layered' after the change.
---
You have time in cat form to kill one before the two mobs kill you.  But you're better off doing a quick opener like rake/claw/rip (can do that combo with zero delay with 100 energy) and switch to bear.  You'll take way less damage, and bear DPS is somewhat respectable once you get the 21/22 pt talents to boost maul damage by 20%.   In contested areas or with lots of mobs around, bear form can trundle through tons of mobs very safely whereas cat you will take damage at a way faster rate and have to burn mana shifting/healing. 
---
Roots are also a very easy and low mana CC, and lasts just about long enough to kill the 1st mob without taking any damage from the 2nd.  
---
Taurens have it EZ dealing with up to three mobs.  You can warstomp every 90 seconds (stuns up to 3 mobs) and regrowth+rejuv and shift back to bear on yourself.  Demo roar is also worthwhile if fighting 3 mobs, and swipe happens to ALSO hit 3 mobs.  If you have some decent gear with 15% crit or more, and the bear form talent to +5 rage when you crit, you can maintain a swipe spam on 3 mobs not every GCD but more than 50% of the time and do very respectable DPS with swipe+thorns+autoattacks.
---
Moonglade. My first ever character back in Vanilla was a night elf rogue and exploring Moonglade had me hooked on the game ever since!
---
Guess you can bank your epic mount money till P4 as well then since it wont be needed in any pve.
---
As opposed to no healer joining and you waste everyones time?
---
Yup, a "reserve" would require that everyone be notified before the dungeon starts
---
This isn't my addon, just something I found while digging and figured I would share it.
---
Arcanite bars were 75g on my server 
---
Think they're like 60/70 currently
---
It costs exactly 0 gold to level BS to 300 if you have mining and did it while leveling.
---
that is just wrong, a shield adds nothing against Fire Elementals, Geddon or Ragnaros as they do purely elemental damage which can not be mitigated by blocking or armor.
---
When you are running a build like 9/21/21 sac gives you some nice flexibility.  If you are grouped you sac the succubus for extra shadowbolt damage.  Have a terrible healer that is refusing to heal life tap?  Sac the void instead.  Farming?  Sac the void.  In and AoE heavy situation?  Sac the Imp.  Its a pretty versatile build as you get the shadow cannon crits from ruin, but enjoy the instant corruption for solo play.
---
If you are running a farming build like 30/21/0, again you sac the void for farming and the succubus if you do any 5 man content.
---
You can always talk about it in Tips' twitch chat.

Gotta be Bay of Storms, in Azshara. There's nothing like being outside fishing after a storm rolls through, and that's what fishing in Azshara always reminds me of.
---
I've officially seen three epics drop, Shadowfang which a rogue got and equipped, Something Northern Winds (the 49 one-hand mace), and the book from DM. My tank in my guild got the book so that was actually dope, now we need to get more than 8 active members to do Onyxia lol. If I would've been 15 years younger I would have lost sleep over all of those drops, but I didn't even think twice about it. We're all pretty damn good at this game now, I know I have pre-raid BiS mostly and I'm getting 20-30g a day casually gearing. I'll have my epic mount eventually. I don't grief at all about loot. We'll see if I feel the same way when Eye of Divinity drops and I lose it to a garbage priest.

Rogue is absolutely super useful in PvE. They consistently top DPS meters in both groups and raids. Also Bladeflurry is fucking insane. Being able to hit 600+ DPS in prebis is nuts.
---
people tend to be proud of the crowning achievement of their life
---
You just create an icon weakaura with the ‚Äùaction usable‚Äù trigger for the respective ability, you‚Äôll figure it out if you play around with the addon its easy.
---
the +threat talents are in the upper tiers of the tree, which fury tanks take anyway
---
everything below the third tier is QoL stuff
---
I don‚Äôt take kindly to your type around our women!
---
Buying epics for high amouts of Gold is the same as people saving up for a expensive sportscar, makes zero sense unless you are a massive fan of the particular item or it will only cost you 10-20% of your networth imo
---
Azshara its peaceful forest with great farms!
---
Greatwizard = mage class hero
---
Won't need it ;)
---
Of course you should.  They spent many hours leveling their craft.  They are taking the time out of their day to help you out.  I'll lock pick for friends for free, but if you open a trade window and put a box in it, without even messaging me and don't offer a tip, I'm walking away from you.
---
What a scumbag
---
We're talking about pvp here. Where no, you cant blindfold yourself ever.
---
That's cruel, I'd be fuming
---
I'm more baffled by the guy in trade chat who thinks the Robe of the Void pattern is a fair trade for one Righteous Orb
---
I‚Äôve always loved Un‚ÄôGoro. It gives me a very Land of the Lost feeling and even has a reference to Dr. Rick Marshall. The crystals are also a reference. I also love how everything looks normal sized until you get close. A small gap between the land and a tree root and you get close and you can pass under it. Giant dinosaurs. Legend of Zelda references. I also always loved how when it rains and just after, the ground has a heavy steam that indicates how hot it is in the zone. 
---
Just a beautifully designed zone.
---
Hey now, I'm trying to lead the witness here. Guy obviously has a beef with a small time streamer content creator like Skarm killed his dog or something.
---
Can someone break down the different types of BRD runs that people do and what level you should be looking to do them?  Just dinged 53 on my warlock and looking to jump into a dungeon for a little boost of xp before getting back to grinding/would enjoy some new gear as I'm mostly still rocking my shadoweave set (sans chest which I replaced with robe of winter night since it'll last me until I get a raid drop to replace so seemed like money well spent to get it while leveling).
---
SO MANY MACROS heh.  Nice writeup.  I will second everything you said here.  
---
I want to expand on macros.  It's very helpful to make a basic macro to pull yourself out of form to cast various abilities.  one example: 
---
/showtooltip
---
/cancelform
---
/dismount
---
/cast !rebirth
---
This will automatically cancel whatever form you're in (or dismount) and cast the max available rank of rebirth.  If you're already in caster form then it won't change anything- no worries. 
---
You can also 'double up' on many abilities if you put them on your primary action bar, as this changes whether you're in caster/bear/cat.  My spammable key binds (q e r f t g 1 2 3 4)  are on the primary action bar and are only abilities relevant to that specific form I am in.  This is IMO the only way you can not run out of space on your bars because druids have so many abilities.  Then, on your SEPARATE action bars, you put abilities that you would want to cast regardless of the form you're in.  Some examples-
---
Moonfire
---
roots
---
Rebirth
---
Regrowth
---
Healing Touch
---
Mounting up (post level 40)
---
This enables you to instantly start casting any of those abilities with one keypress, even if you're stealthed in cat form.  You instantly shift out and start it, which can save valuable time in PVP or just save you keypresses and time in general which adds up.  You can also pull off some really cool plays, for example you're in a 2v2 with a warrior/priest and they kill your buddy.  You're in bear form.  Feral charge teh warrior, run JUST out of melee range, and popout of bear to cast rebirth on your friend.  Poof.  Often you can pull off plays quick enough where people don't really realize what's happening and miss the opportunity to interrupt.  I'm really psyched for BGs on my druid as they have a huge amount of sophistication in combat and a wide variety of diffrent roles and styles are possible, all within one spec.
---
I‚Äôll do some more playing with it tonight, thanks for the info. Maybe it has to kill you before targeting others?
---
Just correct the typo "having made up" with "setting the droprate according to the recorded statistics based on the vanilla players experience". There were already droprates on thotbott during vanilla, for example.
---
It‚Äôs funny you bring up not holding an opinion simply to please the masses when the only ever time I‚Äôve ever heard anyone give a shit about infernals is on this sub and I played the entirety of Vanilla. You‚Äôre also posting in a comment thread In agreement with everyone and the comment to which you replied is downvoted.
---
Does the key get expended each time?
---
Thank you for your response! Now I just have to find a video with the growl animation so I can recognize it
---
There were server transfer off Skeram that many people took advantage of, specifically Alliance.
---
Against the rules to witch hunt here.
---
As I said, I wasn't talking specifically about rag. They had their tanks die throughout all of MC.
---
I too would like to know.
---
No, you got that from drakkisath. What did you get from quest
---
Do we know which phase has the STV fishing tourney? Or did it not come out until BC?
---
Every slot should be taken up with better debuffs although it does seem like annihilator proc rate is so low it might not be worth the slot.
---
Well there we go even more opinions on OPs statement being incorrect
---
Remember when people were losing their minds over the 1 skeleton per player cap?  Pepperidge Farm remembers.
---
I would have to say The Hinterlands.  When playing Vanilla this was the zone I have the fondest memories leveling my Dwarf in.  Classic I am looking forward to leveling there again but as an Orc.
---
plus when you type something here you also have the option of auto correct which I personally use every day. in game I dont have that and I am sure I make small spelling mistakes.
---
and as a follow-up, what constitutes a well organized guild? I make a point to do organize groups for 5 mans internally. Do people like raffles and stuff like that? I know those types of things are huge with ESO guilds.
---
It's a crazy OP ring for healers man.
---
There's people out there farming this shit, hundred+ runs. The ring is BiS for a long time due to the high mp5, yes you can lose it, but if you are in a good guild you typically won't, and you can always put on another item after you lose it.
---
One of the best responses to a question like this I've seen. I have a 60 mage and bored af with it. My rogue though?  Can't  imagine being bored.
---
Hm interesting, their own tools are incosistent in that case.
---
I guess it could be enforced by asking for the gold when the ring drops, if the person doesn‚Äôt give the gold, then you roll need on the ring as well.
---
I hear you, played since launch and just hit 32.
---
I‚Äôd stay hotw spec (0/30/21ish) - then you can tank or heal! it‚Äôs a decent healing spec...swiftmend vs 20% int? it‚Äôs not at all obvious that deep resto is a better healing spec.
---
Funny thing is I never played classic, I'm literally a WoD baby and im already better at the game than you are üòÇ
---
*Calm down turbo nerd* is my new go-to.
---
It just depends mainly because you only want one mage in the entire raid to be deep frost with Winter's Chill so he can stack it for everyone else. Going all the way down the arcane tree and halfway down the frost tree will do about 30% more DPS in raid fights than going deep frost. Now, 30% is a huge margin so in my opinion it's not really optional unless you are the one mage in the raid getting Winter's Chill or your raid group is ok with you just straight up doing less damage.
---
Try aux. I find it a lot better than auctioneer.
---
blizzards new strategy seems to be to ban a few random players every now qnd then and see if they appeal the ban.
---
Ah yes, the Orgrimmar Grunt talking to the alliance player.
---
That's all we have
---
I work in Infosec, I don‚Äôt do the take downs but your legal department can contact the registrar and have them transfer ownership after a process.  Sure they might be in a territory that doesn‚Äôt have laws about it but the registrars generally cooperate when a large company‚Äôs legal department engages them.
---
only in your wet dreams kiddo
---
Well I thought you were funny
---
If you're level 48 and you've been playing since launch, you'll be far too late if you start over on another server.
---
PVP content like BGs and Ranks will be released long before you hit 60.
---
Best option would be server transfer (but i dont think those are available outside of high pop servers).
---
I play on Herod. There are still login queues and layering on this server. Had to wait 60 mins in queue last night. (Probably cuz it's reset day)
---
I'm attempting to do this in a way. No idea if it's gonna work out for me or if I'm gonna lose a ton of gold.
---
Hands down Azshara for me.
---
I love the eternal autumn aesthetic, Azuregos and other blue dragons wandering around.
---
I just wish more content was produced for that region and it wasn't shipped unfinished. Truly hope there is a classic+ to expand upon it.
---
It is a beautiful region.
---
However, I will say one thing that I believe everyone in the game detests about it:
---
That damn Duke Hydraxis just had to make his little dinky island home so far away from the flight path and the rest of literally everything.
---
Blackrock Mountain for the PvP of course!
---
 10+ people in my guild have been banned for RMT, all bans were removed within a few days.
---
I don't think so. I also don't think it would be as funny in english as there are some sayings in there that don't have an exact translations.
---
There was at the start. Theres still are a good number of them. While its no 1:1 its not as bad as some servers ive been on. I would like to xfer to heartseeker but ive also been on a dead server with trash economy and zero groups to run stuff and seeing how theres *only* dungeons/raids to run, thats not really an option. Sounds like a fun pvp time to be had though
---
Seems like folks these days really are more toxic, quick to anger, taking sides, and prone to tribalism!
---
This is not true for sword specc, which most rogues are going into raids.
---
Dungeon finder was implemented in TBC and cross realm dungeon finder in 2009, so I guess you shouldn't expect this feature anytime soon.
---
Was there consent? Otherwise #metoo
---
ToS is against personal information. A character name is not personal information, because we don't own our characters, Blizzard does. Also in their ToS.
---
Mostly a joke, little not a joke.
---
Really? There was like 8 of them in org the other day and they were attacking people in the AH. I was just minding my own buisness posting auctions and almost got killed by one!
---
Last night I healed an Ulda run. The tank was the worst ever - I had to beg him to put on a sword and board, beg him to use prot stance, and he still rarely used any shout, clap, etc. If pulling a pack of 2 elites + 3 mobs, he'd focus whichever mob he got to first, sometimes leaving the elites to the DPS (or healer).
---
After 4 deaths, we finally finished. That's the worst thing I've done. I contributed to that tank getting XP and gear. I should have just left after the second wipe.
---
lol..this is awesome
---
Blackrock Mountain, architecture n a lot of dungeons
---
Then phase 2 starts as they start their journey through STV.
---
That's what i did.
---
Mind Flay's debuff has extremely low priority and doesn't actually affect bosses. It's just the slow portion of the spell. MF itself can be spammed without any consequence for debuffs.
---
As for SW:P, your raid is silly to ask a Shadowpriest to come along without setting aside a second debuff slot for them. It provides a huge amount of damage for its mana, and saying "you can't use that" might as well mean you shouldn't bring one at all, given that their SW:P is providing as much, or close to as much, damage as the Warlock DPS boost from SW.
---
The value is very real for each person. The value is identical. How is it selfish to want EACH party member to have a fair shot at that. Isn‚Äôt it selfish to expect a 300g+ item just handed to you without giving the others a fair chance? I don‚Äôt care which way you spin it, it will progress each player who earned that item just the same. BoE are meant to be traded and have an actual value, BoP are not.
---
People on your side of the argument always say need roll for main spec, then off spec, then greed for gold. So what if you have a paladin tank, who wants cloudkeeper legpltes worth 1000g for his offset to pvp with once a week for an hour, which is a slight upgrade over his rare dm west legs. Do you seriously feel it‚Äôs right and worth that items value to let him take it for a minor stat upgrade once a week for a little pvp? He would never buy that item for half the value, and any player in that party would progress their character much further by selling that item and using the gold in a smart way. This is a very possible scenario, so how would you feel about that?
---
I almost never buff anyone because max level fort uses like 1/3 of my mana
---
And I've never had anyone bitch about it either
---
that guy is a tool lol
---
I think warlock is one of the best class designs not just in wow but across many mmo games. Not saying it's the only good class by any means but they just have such a huge amount of interesting abilities to mess around with. Rogue is another well designed class with a ton of cool tools to fool around with. With classes like this you can really throw some variety into everyday tasks like grinding or questing. 
---
It's quite sad how they crushed all the classes down to have less variety and identity in later expansions. Having said that I still thing retail warlock is a fun class, but just feels strange because mana is literally always full, so you don't have that fun juggling mini-game of balancing your health with your mana.
---
Exactly, and someone who would do that gets blacklisted on their server over 200g. Now that person can‚Äôt find a group. Server communities need to police this.
---
Yup.
---
Blackrock Depths.  I love the scale and the mechanics of the dungeon.
---
Can we get a player name and a realm so we can 1. avoid this situation for ourselves and 2. call him out every chance we get if we Are on the server? 
---
Lets put this wow classic server lock to good use!
---
Found the drama. I was unaware. Thanks for sharing.

What you read was ‚Äúeveryone who gets banned actually did it and the ban is permanent.‚Äù

I'm skipping most late game dungeons unless I'm doing them with my guild. I found a few recipes that I'll grind out that seem good for MC but I can't be asked to do BRD 100 times over for 1.2 more dps
---
Yea repair bot, jumper cables, seaforium charges (Might be wrong name, but there's an engineering item that unlocks doors)
---
Not to mention the stun grenades are good for AOE farming and not too expensive.
---
Who enforces "regime change" when people won't pay up?
---
lul
---
How hard is it to find groups? Thinking of rolling horde on bloodfang but don't want to be stuck on my own
---
Badonk n donk
---
Always need.
---
I did a lot of theory-crafting for holy priests and by all my calculations, thuzadin sash is always better than devout belt.
---
The community be weird sometimes lol. /ignore and move on
---
I've been in several different guilds throughout Classic already, and I can tell you the two main things we've done to recruit members. 
---
1. Find them through repeated content. A lot of guilds look for new members RIGHT NOW, and that's just not how it normally works. I managed to convince a guy on my friends list last night to come join our guild. Keep in mind though, we've been friends for a month, I've run multiple pieces of content with him, and we've always had good experiences together. It wasn't a random invite, and I think that's what tipped it in my favor over his current guild. When you find good players, add them, and let them know you're adding them. If you want members in the 50-60 range, then focus dungeons like BRD, UBRS, and Dire Maul for these kinds of people. Then, when you've got 3/5 people for your guild run, recruit from your friends list first before going to LFG. I promise you, people will both remember you and your guild, and appreciate that you invited them, even if they don't accept. 
---
2. Recruit through end-game content. Two weeks ago, I was in a guild just starting MC. We quickly went from \~20 level 60's to nearly 60, just because we picked up so many pugs that we liked and/or liked us and wanted to stay. I've since left that guild (its a long story, but boils down to leadership problems), and joined a guild that was ironically in a similar spot. Last night we tried to run MC, and we only had 17 players from our guild available, although only 13-14 of those were level 60. But just from running a single MC pug, we picked up 4 new guild members, and at least 4 possible members. These are just ones I know of off the top of my head - there's no telling how many people are considering staying (I hope, anyway). 
---
Randomly inviting people CAN work, but those will players will have no connection/investment to the guild, and can very easily be swayed to join a different guild using the two methods I just described.
---
He didn't say anything about Tauren being rogues.

---
In game theory for fairness everyone should need
---
Ideally you will need it last while everyone else greeds, then you have everyone roll and give it to the winner
---
Yeah 100%. My wording doesn‚Äôt show it, but I advocate for reserving.
---
8 int = 120 mana and a tiny tiny amount of spell crit. Possibly equals to one spell cast more depending on your level.  
---
9 Spell power, depending on spell is from around 1 to 9 extra damage per spell depending on the spell you use.  
---
For arcane, Arcane missiles scale the best with 100% scaling, that is your arcane missiles would do 9 damage more (total if all 5 missiles hit). However, this is only true for rank 3 and greater. Spell ranks that can be obtained before lvl 20 have a great penalty to scaling.  
---
For a complete lest of scaling coefficients see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/95abc8/list_of_spellcoefficients_1121/?utm_source=amp&amp;utm_medium=&amp;utm_content=post_body). The info may not be perfectly accurate but that is the best what we have. Please do note that these values are true only for spell ranks that can be learned at lvl 20 or after. Consult the wowhead classic pages for what rank of spell you need to have at minimum.  
---
Now you have the info so you can make the call.
---
No, it's a permanent key that you can re-use.
---
I put myself in the position of where someone in my group would actually need that item while I would sell it. For me it just personally doesnt feel right taking that item from them because I feel like they are the ones who have first call on it.   
---
Dont know, I just look at it very simply. The Need button is there if you will wear the item, the Greed item is there if you are taking it for profits.
---
Devout isn't tier 1. Prophecy is.
---
sorry i meant your‚Äôare
---
I‚Äôm 55 and I‚Äôve seen 0. I‚Äôve had 1 boe blue drop when grouped. I guess I‚Äôm saving my luck for 60
---
Do you play on Fairbanks?
---
yea i haven't seen it mentioned as single layer yet.
---
The Barrens, because the Chuck Norris jokes will always make me smile.
---
Some guy offered enchanting for tips, and when my tip wasn't big enough (he expected 5g for a common enchant), he held my material ransom until I raised my "tip" to his demand.
---
I reported him and he has definitely not received a 24h ban because he's online every time I checck.
---
Usual day at EU-golemagg or ther hight pop serv xd.
---
I'm still trying to understand what happened here in the first place.  So he sent the Axe expecting money for it, and they will just keep it in his mailbox?  Won't it eventually get returned?  Or can he delete it?
---
why go for dreadmist instead of t1?
---
You don't need to be stealthed to distract
---
Just respecced from arms to prot on my 52 warrior to start ranking BRD and I'm worried I made a mistake.  
---
I tend to play on odd hours when it can be hard to find groups. Last night I decided to quest instead and it takes so long to kill anything! What stance/weapons/skills should I be using?
---
Also is it better to do ST or BRD up to arena in terms of xp?
---
The barrens.
---
You saved that poor man from a life wasted on WoW. Kudos, OP, you‚Äôre a hero.
---
Yet you look at warcraftlogs and every single boss is a fury warrior lmao
---
I'm leveling a paladin and a bunch of these guides recommend prot to level because of reckoning. Unfortunately a good number of them are talking about using the private server /sit method, which does not work. 
---
I don't really enjoy the whole "slow two hander auto attacking seal of casino" style, of leveling. Does prot still have the ability to aoe kill normal mobs at a decent speed with reckoning functioning as intended instead of relying on a bug?
---
Also, if I do take that route and grab reckoning, would I be better off going the whole 30 into prot and grabbing holy shield immediately, or will I level faster grabbing conceration first then going back into the tree for holy shield?
---
I'm level 34 right now. I'm pretty sick of ret and switching to either holy or prot as soon as I get my sword of serenity. Either way I plan to be either healing or tanking in dungeons, which I've been able to do both fine so far.
---
&gt; As you push into Ungoro be sure to do the Power Crystal stuff and farm Crystal Charge and Crystal Spire - they help immensely with threat. Crystal Spire helps if you don't have a druid/lock to give you a reflect damage buff, and Crystal Charge is great if you're a non-engineer as it's basically a dynamite. 
---
I'm a 60 tank, and I have no idea what you're talking about here. Can you explain?
---
Dun Morogh. Perfect starting zone for the dwarves.
---
It‚Äôs literally free to the mage and all you do is stand there and press conjure 12 times and evocate in between if needed. Boom 1 gold and you help out a priest or whatever. But if you‚Äôre one of those high and mighty mages who cba to do anything then gg I guess 
---
I give away waters for free and you cba for 1 g. Lol fuck.
---
Mara, princess run parts for sure.
---
I've always felt that if there is anything at all contentious about rolling I announce my intentions ahead of time.
---
"That BoE epic is a large upgrade for me that I can equip right now, anyone object to me rolling need?"
---
"I can use that ring drop when I gain my next level, anyone care that I roll for it now?"
---
Etc. If anyone can give a *legit* reason that I shouldn't roll for something (bigger upgrade for someone right now or whatever) then I'll roll greed. If they can't then I roll how I like.
---
The gaurds are rouges.
---
Doesnt really matter how much the tank couldve made, its how much do you want to do the dungeon. I hit 60 and got decent pre-raid gear on my prot. Im now starting to res items and sell tank services to groups. The thing is, you can either sit in LFG for an hour or more as 3 DPS or you can let me have my 30g in trash drops and we get this thing done. It becomes not what my alternative is, but what is your alternative.
---
Also, to say that passive gold dropped from a dungeon will pay for repairs, sure. However, they will pay for repairs and then what, you come out maybe 10 silver ahead--and only maybe, if the group went smooth. People dont make tanking pots/explosives/etc. cheap. That mage who didnt get hit once and can go 5 dungeon runs without repairing and only taking a 1g hit when he does gets the same passive flow without constantly using it just to repair. Tanks are needed, but its not like its a costless task in this game.
---
really intense name friend!
---
My holy spells crit more.
---
ticket please!!
---
Also bandages to heal yourself and the adds when convenient. I used 2 bandages on myself and one on a npc it's not much, but it's free. You cannot use them aggressively, but when you are in a stable moment and can afford to use a few, do it. Or when you are oom.
---
So what add-on is that that shows all that good info on the items?  TSM or something different?  I would look up TSM but kinda at work so can't right now.
---
Nessingways camp in STV. No matter what time of day, when I go there I expect PvP. You never know who is hiding in a tent looking to ruin your day.
---
I give away waters for free most of the time. No idea what you‚Äôre talking about.
---
They just ran out of the water! Look at their outfits
---
Blackrock Mountain!
---
Every response you have made in the above chains it feels like your hostile.
---
I'm not sure if it's because English isn't your native language but try and use less accusing questions and you might not paint the picture of being an asshat.
---
I‚Äôm still seeing it spammed. Even not ganking just random places. that and A N A L are the top two horde phrases.
---
Was layering just removed on your server?
---
Mine was in the first wave of servers with layering removed weeks ago, and respawns have been 6-9 mins since then
---
While that's true, why not need also when you see someone ninja to lessen the chance they are able to successfully ninja. If a mage rolled on plate, you know they are a ninja already, you can blast trade chat with his name etc but why not all need so you can pass it to the warrior. I really don't get this defeatist attitude just out a sense of moral superiority.
---
That Orc makes a lot of sense tbh
---
Hey me too and the mageblade and the trinket and the ring of spellpower
---
Scholamance, the lich room, it reminds me such of dungeons &amp; dragon exploration
---
Why not say no in the first place then? If you don‚Äôt have the time for it you don‚Äôt have the time for it. What‚Äôs the problem? The moment you decide to cast a few free spells the tip is mandatory. If you want payment say it in advance.
---
so they are fucking warriors. great ... oh so much great
---
BoE's represent an upgrade for everyone. You may not like it, but it's the truth
---
Back in vanilla my guild would go ‚Äúswashbuckling‚Äù which consisted on a 5man or rogues and druids stealthing I the boats to ratchet and booty bay and ganking an allies who were flagged...now I‚Äôm a gnome lock and the tables have turned. Supper crummy thing to do but it was also stupid fun lol
---
Basically a classic wow experience
---
You will also reuse that key at level 60ish :p
---
I didnt know 200-300g was close to an epic mount.
---
Mulgore. Atmosphere and sound
---
Eh, lvl 55 is good but there's only so much prices can increase before players pull back and go with vendor water. You can buy lvl 45 water on the auction house far cheaper than vendor price.
---
Are you looking for advise or for an excuse to roll the way you want?
---
Also why would the healer necessarily leave?  I think a lot of people understand that hybrid classes will compete with them on gear.
---

Blizzard fucked up bad on name res day by only releasing that few servers initially.
---
I used to reply to these types of phishing that, "I've been a bad, bad girl".   One time I managed to say, "come spank me daddy", before they either blocked me or logged off.
---
100% I vividly remember pulling tho‚Äôgrun in blasted lands on my hunter and his adds resetting.
---
Then make your own groups and reserve items? Reserving items as fury happens because of the insanely low drop rate on items we need. Makes not reserving items a potential MASSIVE waste of time
---
This is what I dont get from DPS that scream paying tanks to run groups is crazy. Id probably run a dungeon for 20g. And 20g split by 4 people is only 5g per person. For 5g, you can get yourself off LFG and save yourself the hour+ and get to where you want to be. Youll probably also net more than 5g (or close to it) in the actual dungeon.
---
This is not correct
---
the shadow damage was removed etc. However Brokentooth still has the insane attack speed, which as pointed out is brilliant for PVP for caster spell knock back. 
---
Wolves are good for furious howl in raids.
---
Whoever hits it first. This is called "tagging". If someone else tags the mob before you (i.e., does damage to it before you) then it's name will turn grey and it will be obvious that someone else is getting the loot. 
---
There is no difference if it's between the two factions, except that you'll likely get attacked by the guy who's mob(s) you stole. 
---
If you're in a party, loot just rotates through the group, unless it's green or above, in which case players roll. These are default loot rules. So player 1 would get first drop, then player 2, then player 3, until everyone has gotten loot once, and then it repeats starting back at player 1.

WHITEMANE GANG GANG

*They ALL need it for use.*
---
That's the point.   BoE's can be traded.  Anyone who wins the BoE will get an upgrade.

It's greedy to try to guilt your party into giving it to *you*, when it's an upgrade for *everyone.*
---
How the hell do you get that high

Its expensive as fuck to level Bsmithing.

You can do jump runs as a mage and a priest only?!

---
The behavior portion is open to interpretation and I think you could make a case here.
---
There's a line drawn somewhere between doing something to another player, such as clicking their portrait and clicking follow, and doing it to an extent where you're disrupting their ability to enjoy their game.
---
This could reasonably be described as abusing a game mechanic at another players expense. The follow feature isn't there so you can relentlessly (this is the correct use of the word) follow a person's avatar and ignore pleads to stop.
---
Is this really that hard to understand? If so, I encourage you to log in and try it out for a week with your guild and see if they're enjoying it by the end of the week.  Don't talk, just have your character follow them closely every day.
---
I don't think it's weird that multiple people cimplained.
---
Thank god im in a top3 EU guild :D
---
Entry to stormwind when the music kicks in
---
Thousand needles
---
I think the one who damages the mob first "tags" the mob then receives the loot. 
---
But if for example a lowbie tags a mob by hitting it once, then a high-level (non-grouped) player finishes it off, the lowbie will only get XP for the amount of damage ti did.
---
Herbalism, mining, and skinning are all gathering professions that make money.
---
Honestly they're all about the same but mining has the most synergy with engineering so that may prove helpful.
---
Whoever is the first to put damage on the target is the one who ‚Äútags‚Äù or ‚Äúgets the tag‚Äù on the mob. 
---
First damage is key here. If a priest puts shadow word pain on the target but some Druid comes by and hits it with moon fire (instant damage) before the priest dot does damage, the tag goes to the Druid.
---
a good "click to cast" healing addon is a must have 
---
I recommend Healbot it is easy to set up, it monitors buffs, debuffs, threat, and you can set shift modifiers for down ranking heals and dispels.  Also monitors the whole raid for incoming heals to help stop overhealing.  
---
Not many macros as far as priests go I just bind my mana potions and Inner Focus to use when I am getting low on mana.
---
Someone else posted this and one of the responses was your epic mount will always be there while gear will change with phases. Get the mount now and loot later.
---
Porsche and Skoda did, and those are part of VW Group.
---
Damn I wish. They are like 35g on my server right now
---
Too much effort
---
Epic mount cost 900g atm.......so that's why I said no more worth than 400g.......and ya 200g really is not that much, easily farmed in a day or 2 if playing more casually.
---
So compete, cooperate, or wait. Exactly like it used to be. Layering lasted way too long if people now think its an acceptable way to get their leveling done.
---
complains about layering.  complains when layering is removed.
---
What allegiance?  SM is a good answer but you can also quest.

I can make 50g an hour easy. Just make sure to subscribe and hit that bell. Also, you can buy a gold making instructional PDF from me for only $15!
---
When you tag a mob, the name plate appears as grey to others and then the loot is yours. Typically hitting the mob first will tag it, but sometimes if someone hits it within a certain range of time, and do more damage, they will steal the tag. 
---
In a party any white or below item is round robin, you roll for anything above.
---
Nothing really for warlocks but I go just to go
---
My guild did a strath ud run with a single random and the mount dropped.
---
Did you just seriously say tanks are supposed to be top dps? How terrible is your guild?
---
Also warriors only top dps on horde cause of wf
---
The good guilds do.  It takes a little work to setup, so the casual guilds will just roll or loot council -- both of which have major drawbacks.
---

Always spell power.
---
Unlike post classic, Intellect doesn't transfer any % into spell power.
---
If I remember back in Burning Crusade or WOTLK, a certain % of your total int would equate to some spell power.
---
They are awfully helpful though...  
---
"Aw... they are just so tsundere about the dark arts.... :3" -Random troll in RPer disguise probably

And why did it take blizzard until 2012 to open up the eyes of female taurens on their portraits
---
This doesn't even have one of my favorites.
---
Sometimes the Stormwind guards straight-up deny the existence of a Warlock trainer, but just say there's been reports of demons near where the trainer actually is.
---
I wouldn't call it a default channel as you are not in the chat by default. Rather, it's a blizzard monitored channel, maybe?
---
Though I see your point that it's part of the game by default.
---
I haven't raided for years but I remember this feeling very well, it was awesome when our main tank got an upgrade or anyone else for that matter as it meant we could have a slightly better chance at beating that boss that was handing our asses to us. I still remember our guild hitting certain walls in wotlk naxx, there was a few bosses in there that stopped us in our tracks for a few weeks, we weren't exactly a hardcore guild so any new boss takedown was very satisfying
---
Oh I totally agree just saying there‚Äôs pros and cons
---
Anecdotal evidence here: Am 60, and shadow spec, tis true. I have a set of healing gear but there is really no need to spec holy or disc until you step into a raid. Strat and scholo can be tough but if the rest of the group is good it's totally doable.
---
I'd look like that but some shaman won my Herod's shoulder
---
That is true. I guess it went off on a bit of a rabbit trail. That was my original intent though and I‚Äôm still confused on which of the two is better
---
warlocks, the original emo outcast class... before there were demon hunters, before there were death knights...
---
Orgrimmar - I've always just loved the feeling of a huge setting and watching all the people just walk around, I sometimes just people watch and chat at the mailbox with whoever is around.
---
Warlocks can make ~100 gph doing solo jump runs. Tanks and healers make 60-90 gph each doing duo jump runs. Priests and locks make 40-60 gph doing mara Princess. Mages make 50-70 gph depending on luck and server economy in DM:E, or 50 gph consistent in ZF. Hunters can pull 60-100 gph doing tribute runs.
---
Go back to BFA then and feel special
---
There's no lfg addon that forces you to use it because they all work the same more or less: by parsing each channel you're in.
---
Brilliant!
---
&gt; I'm not saying that pservers are accurate you illiterate. 
---
Then why use it as the basis for your argument? You made a claim literally saying " Based off private server logs".
---
&gt; Private servers is the most accurate thing to go by. You CANNOT use vanilla footage for this shit. 
---
But the numbers are still wrong, so why do you claim one class is better than another when even the most blizzlike private servers still had wrong balancing?
---
Hot diggety damn! Time to spam this. Although my guild runs in as 40,but phase 2 could change all that.
---
You're the one asserting that a random Carrion Bird whose sole redeeming feature is fast attack speed is one the best PVP pets.
---
Might as well ignore the two wolves and the half-dozen cats that have the exact same thing, and will actually do more damage in PVP.
---
Why not ignore boars and wind serpents as well? Who cares that one has the only CC pets get, and that the other one gets to bypass armor through Lightning Breath, right?
---
Screech isn't a magically redeeming feature, not when you have way better options.
---
Does anyone know what is the most alliance dominated and horde dominated realms are so far?
---
Only mages have an ability that generates 20s per cast tho. I usually pay 1g for portals and it varies how much water I get for 1g, usually 4-5 stacks.
---
Ahhh, but you need the demonic figurine.
---
So it‚Äôs not free.
---
I didn't think about that at first. But since I'm nearly exalted with TB and am going for a kodo, I still think it's better that someone else gets it. Instead of me using it for a week.
---
I was answering them. A couple of people spoke about caster items and said that no healer would come on them runs without golem or an incentive to come. That has not been the case, and I told them. Basically every reply has been irrelevant to what I was speaking about. Maybe I am a dick, or maybe you guys get your feelings hurt waay to easy, like I haven't even tried to offend anyone. If you really need a safe space where there is absolutely no negativity  then I'd wager that the internet is not for your delicate soul.

How much would you pay for Maiden's Circle?

There are quite a few on my server's AH but they range from 400-600g.

This is the opposite of that MC Gnome Drowning post.

The real question is:

Did you /y AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

i ran it a few time, saw 2 veins mostly, 3 veins once.

Stone talon Peak as an alliance character, felt so cool the first time levelling there deep in enemy territory along with the rising slope of terrain until you finally reach a haven of safety at the peak.
---
And my American head. Had no idea Joe Rogan was still relevant...
---
Throughout my 30's, Fortitude was 3-4 buffs per mana bar.
---
I do buff people when I can afford the mana to, but I'm not going to stop and drink for it.
---
Yes and those you listed are still not reaching 30, even with inspiration and other things it's difficult to reach the cap. I'm not saying impossible, but for 99% of players it's not really an issue.
---
I tank basically every dungeon so it isnt an issue for me. I get to roll on both.
---
And it doesn't even make sense, because the Forsaken used to be human! That always drove me nuts, haha.
---
nice one
---
Absolutely the barrens. I spend so much time there that it must be my favorite.
---
Because they do.
---
No, he's saying that dps warriors in guilds with bad tanks are threat capped.
---
Well at least you heard the name.
---
Classes who dont have buffs I always give. Classes that can buff I don't unless they buff me first. So many druids and priest I buff and get nothing in return.
---
Orgrimmar, right when you walk in and see the zeppelin way high up.

I'm wondering how trolls got a bow bonus over night elves, lorewise they should get throwing axes spec or something. Rofl.
---
Tanking spec is just horrible solo, there's really nothing you can do about it. I would highly recommend a fury/prot talent setup so you can level too you really won't be losing much in regards to tanking in dungeons. [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7vb7dc/tanking\_as\_a\_fury\_warrior/dtse23b?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7vb7dc/tanking_as_a_fury_warrior/dtse23b?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

Probably an addon messing up
---
Well, he is technically there to promote his new Netflix show (Sean mentions it in his first question iirc). He just doesn't plug it at the end. 
---
The same thing happened when he was on the Breakfast show for BBC Radio 1. He was there to promote his show but he did the ol' nice guy just here to have fun sorta spiel.
---
Don't get me wrong, love Paul Rudd and how he has handled promo for his new show, but at the end of the day he was still promoting.
---
Or maybe the alliance don't gather in iron forge? 
---
[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dlqljr/server_skeram_with_no_more_layers/f4uv8lt) is another user that posted what he says is a pic of stormwind at the same time on skeram. 
---
We've got an imbalance, but there is still plenty of alliance.
---
Good to know. TIL!
---
I like consecration then prot. it only takes a little while longer to kill 4-5 monsters at a time than to kill 1. 
---
(i never really liked ret/2h either.)
---
The problem is you‚Äôre level 50 before you have holy shield.
---
idk if it‚Äôs more efficient than ret or not, but i like it more. 
---
Then i finish out holy and wind up with 20/31/0 - a decent healing spec, an adequate dungeon tanking spec, and a good aoe/soloing spec.
---
If your horde this mount is not a big deal, you can just farm the rep and buy it
---
They're both very close to be fair, if you have both then do a quick test to see on a couple of tank and spank dungeon bosses but I doubt you'll see much difference
---
I was wondering how he saw so many, I‚Äôve only seen like 2
---
Unfortunately you're correct. Picking up consecration and running dungeons sounds like a good change of pace though. =)

Close, but a layer is a whole game map not just a continent.  They're not being slowly removed.  They're being aggressively removed and were down to ~5 realms with 2 layers and the rest are layer free.
---
I wonder if you meant desolace or feralas. Hinterlands to Maraudon is quite a trip.
---
I farmed around ~250 Leather total and I've never seen one respawn pre 10 minutes. Today I've farmed ~40 Leather and I've never seen one respawn later than 8.
---
No it's not mostly because of that, that's how it looks all the time. 
---
Stormwind is not better and is certainly nothing like the picture in the OP. It's like 1/5th of that at peak hours pre-raid on a Tuesday, if even that many.
---
I've been rerolling to fill our shadow spot while we recruit warlocks because we ended up having 5 resto druids signed up for one of our first raids. Last night I was aggressively corpse camped by over 20 unique horde players to the point of rez sickness 5 times in 5 hours. No provocation, just trying to get quests done. 
---
Arathi, Badlands, Swamp of Sorrows, Tanaris, Dustwallow, it doesn't matter. It's been like this most nights since I passed level 30 and in every zone. Never a 1v1, always a level 60 friend or two, always at least 3-4 other horde my level in the area. You can't even hardly retaliate against the frequent ganks because it rapidly becomes a 1v5, if not immediately, then within a minute or two.
---
The discrepancy was noticeable on my first toon, post-exodus and now that there are plenty of 60s around... it's literally unplayable at times. Imagine afk-ing as a ghost over your body after the 5th time being killed in an area by a 60 and 3 friends, and after returning to see yourself being cannibalized t-bagged. You rez 20 minutes later after making a snack and nobody is around, and 4 more unique horde who have nothing to do with what already happened now dominate the same quest area, and kill you on sight another 5 times.
---
That's Skeram.
---
... and then they have the audacity to call it 70/30.
---
Thanks!

I rerolled about two weeks ago, currently level 24 I might be 60 a week or two after New Years.

You have a hard time staying on point dont you? Lol.
---
Haha what? Sorry if I'm misunderstanding, but you think world pvp over questing areas is going to cause factions to sway back into balance? Assuming I've got that correct, the opposite is true. Servers heavily skewed to one faction will become more skewed to that particular faction due to the ease they have in controlling those questing areas (2.5x the amount of people, easier to find backup/support, etc).
---
God forbid we try to raid on a Tuesday too.
---
On my server they go for 300g. I personally wouldn‚Äôt pay more than 200-250g. But that‚Äôs me.
---
Freezing Band is slightly better, but also great for PvP
---
Just wait until the honor system comes out. It's going to be all out war in that mountain.
---
If you don't have the hit soft cap you should go for +hit.
---
If you do have the hit soft cap you should go for HoJ.
---
My crit rating is pretty low though which is where fury/prot shines. I think I have 6-8% crit without talents in my DPS gear.
---
Your buff is the ganker(s) attack you first, giving me enough time to decide if I should fight back or bubblehearth out. For that you get BoM.
---
Execute is literally a sucide button that fight
---
Yes, 
---
1) Hang a left at the first intersection, kill all the raptors in that circle and the boss. 
---
2) when you made it all the way around and are back at the first intersection, go into the trench in the same direction you did the circle. This will take on a 1 way track that ends on a boss. 
---
3)  Jump down and run back through the trench in the only direction you haven't been yet. This is a bit more complicated to type out but you walk straight until you see a shortcut with pretty plants and water, take that and work your way around the outer edge of the map you can see on the mini-map while you go out, around, and up hill. Eventually you'll get to a boss with a deviate shambler, after that there will be a boss (skurm?)  lightning lizard, and then up the hill over the jump (through  the woods  to gra..)  to the  last druid boss and the oversized Shambler boss.
---
4) jump down the hole behind the Shambler and go back to the entrance and escort numbnutz to the last boss.
---
An alliance 4 levels above me tried killing me the other day, lol I destroyed him my health barely moved
---
Unfortunately, swapping to shield in combat using a macro invokes a 1.5 gcd so you wouldn't be able to get a shield bash off in time unless it's a long cast. If hes of level, macro Berserker Stance with Pummel would be ideal. It also resets the weapon swing timer, so ideally you would try to time the swap right after a slow swing while also at the very beginning of a long cast. Suppose it could work for mobs that cast big heal or something
---
This sub exaggerated negative consequenses of logical changes hmmm what a suprise *Couch layering cough*
---
Reserving the first orb seems fair and I've allowed tanks to do that. I would never join a group if the tank was asking to reserve all orbs as that just seems too much. One guaranteed orb plus the additional loot is a very solid gold farm for you.
---
But I have a really nice staff right know. Not sure when I would get a 1 hand to replace it. I have the staff from Deadmines.
---
Well, that is my point. Whatever the given argument is, people will say "IT IS BLIZZARD THEY KNOW THE RIGHT NUMBERS". And blizzard can set any droprate they want - people will just believe them.

---
Wow, use for Darnassus confirmed.
---
Are fury warriors really doing that?  Queuing and unqueuing heroic strike as a part of their rotation?  Sounds horrible.
---
Must be recent. Edited.
---
You seem very knowledgeable, and 2 days isn't too old, so let me present my situation to you:
---
I currently run fury/prot, and by wearing mostly dps plate with 1 leather piece and 1 mail piece, I can achieve 6% hit (human) and 27% crit (raid buffed, no consumables, 21% crit without). The difference in armor from using the leather and mail piece is I go down from 6800 armor buffed to 6100 armor buffed. I do tank with a shield, only swapping to dual-wield when I do not actively have agro, and I have pretty consistent flurry uptime (roughly 80%) and I utterly crush my fellow tank, who is impale prot, in threat. That said, he does take a little less damage (healer's say they can't tell, but my observations show my health bar dips a bit further than his does, and he has more health in general).
---
This is particularly useful for a lot of fights to allow bursting down the first add quickly, but specifically it has helped us get Onyxia phase 3 under control.
---
So my question for you is this: With the above stats, is deep prot and/or impale prot a better option than fury/prot if I keep using mostly dps plate (with the aforementioned non-plate pieces)? Or is the reason behind my absurd threat more to do with the synergy between fury/prot and said stats?
---
Need some macro help, working on a macro for my rogue to swap from Dagger MH - Sword OH to the opposite after I open.  The issue I'm having is the macro seems to get messed up and will only swap 1 wep, unequip 1 or just start SS without it up.  Here's what I have:
---
&gt;/equipslot 16 Wingblade
---
/equipslot 17 Meteor Shard
---
/cast Sinister Strike
---
Is there anyway to make this macro more reliable?  Often times I end up with my dagger still MH despite spamming this.  Would it be easier just to take the macro off of my sinister strike key and make it's own binding for swapping weps around?
---
You're wrong.
---
If you were planning on AoE-farming with Protection, or playing Protection at all really, you would need to immediately rush for Concecration. It's your main threat generator _and_ AoE damage. Then, afterwards, you would go down the tree towards Holy Shield, collecting the Improved Righteous Fury talent soon as you can if you're planning on going into dungeons.  
---
And, honestly, Protection's AoE farming _isn't_ that good. Unlike Mages, you can't exactly kite the monsters, and Protection doesn't exactly tote any good survivability abilites. AoE-farming for Protection is using Thorns-type trinkets and effects to AoE-farm lower level dungeons for Gold, rather than leveling. And a further unfortunate fact of life is that no matter how terrible Retribution's leveling experience is it's by far the best for solo Paladin.  
---
I would recommend Healing Dungeons if you want to level faster. It's way better for you.
---
Better in terms of raw healing power, but some people like to have stats like stamina. The tier pices give you far better stats in general I think. So if you are a min max glass cannon pro, sure don't use much tier. 
---
I'm going more heavily to tier gear, but using the DM belt for sure. And the DM pants until I can get the T2. Targeting 3 or 4 pieces of T1. Have the bracers and shoulders. Probably also picking up the gloves and boots.
---
You're like 2 weeks into 2 years of end game. If you had full epics you'd be bored.
---
Fucking hell there's no pleasing some people.
---
It's the 2nd month and you have a piece of tier 2 stop whining.
---
What‚Äôs it‚Äôs like to be objectively wrong?
---
This I remember :)
---
Stick around, friend. My friends and I were in a guild that transferred to a server that‚Äôs the same skew but leaning alliance. We called them super weenies and stayed. I‚Äôd rather not have issues finding opposing players to kill, and I think it‚Äôll actually be easier to climb the PVP ranks with so little competition in our faction. Always gotta look at the bright side
---
Scarlet Monastery.  First dungeon that feels utterly epic!
---
If the success of WoW classic creates a new wave of old-style MMO's with no microtransactions, real class diversity, less 'daily task' stuff, I'd be for it. Even if it wasn't Blizzard that made the games.
---
Tauren starting zone, the nostalgia is overwhelming
---
Those are all those inflated youtube numbers he was talking about. Realistically those farms all make about 50-75 % of what your stating.
---
Our best geared dps warrior fought for top 3 but now that I have ragnaros dagger it‚Äôs not even close
---
No, it's continent and has been said as such by blizzard. Not sure why you think it's aggressive removal either but w/e.
---
Plot twist, OP's friend has an addictive personality and died of a heroin overdose at the age of 13.
---
I wouldn't worry about what those icons are called - think about their function.  With regards to boes, one is for equal distribution and the other is for individual priority.  Why should one player have priority on an item that we have already established has equal value to all players? That is greed.
---
Dun Morogh.  One of my closest friends got me started playing WoW with him. He brought his lvl 32 dwarf warrior over when I spawned in game and I remember the feeling of young me entering into this world with my friend right in that first area. Always brings me a smile when I see it. When we both decided to leave back at the end of WOTLK we logged out at the starting spawn area for dwarfs and gnomes. He is deployed overseas now so I dont see him much, but whenever I play classic and am in the zone it reminds me of him and those early days. I try to log out there when I can so I'm greeted by it when I log in.
---
What other motivation does a character that doesn't need anything from any of the bosses in the dungeon have to be there. Are you new to Warcraft?
---
I exaggerate a little, but currently our last run was roughly 2 hours without any world buffs and we had 2 full wipes and few random deaths. And my guild is not hardcore at all, more like casual but competent.
---
Tbh. Its your own fault.  
---
We swapped from Lucifron to Venoxis, BECAUSE of it being the massive streamer server and it will always have a queue. My guildleader is super happy with that decision, and you literally get a free char transfer, that you wont use. Why? "BeCaUsE sTrEaMeR sErVeR !!!". Venoxis is also full. But atleast I only have queues on prime hours.
---
I thought it would take me untill then to get to 60, but after I hit 44 got my mount and respeccd to shadow I hit 51 almost 52 over one set of days off (6days). So I figure by end of November I'll be 60. Literally felt like 25-35 was longer than 40-51
---
He does some real interesting podcasts but he also does some really dumb ones.
---
How did I divert from the point? I said the ring isn't worth more than 400g, which is 500g less than epic mount. Meaning in my kind the ring should last roughly 10 months at 400g anything more just is not worth value/time wise on your gold. 
---
At least on my server the rings are selling for around 700-800g, so at that price they would have to last well into AQ 40, which they don't.
---
In BWL possible. AQ40 almost guaranteed, Naxx definitively. 
---
But MC and Ony? no. You'll be hardly pressed to heal through your mana pool and a pot/dark rune.
---
Nah.

Yeah,  if you actually read what I said instead of just pretending your greed is justified, you'd at least appear to be trying to discuss in good faith.
---
And agreed that loot rules being established before a run clear any confusion,  but that's clearly,  clearly not what we're discussing here. 
---
The greed button is gold coins because that's the button you click if you want an item just to sell it.  Literally how the system was designed 14 years ago.
---
I see people advertising MC trash runs with no bosses (so your don't get raid locked).  It is tempting, but I don't really trust these people.  For all I know it is some crappy pug they started and got 1-2 bosses into before falling apart.  I don't want to risk being raid locked that week, so I never go.  The BoE gear is calling me though...
---
Wholeheartedly disagree, all servers are so populated that these items will always be found on the auction house. by that logic everyone should have the same chance to roll on them because just because you're going to equip them doesn't mean you can't just go buy them on the auction house. The group is basically paying for the bracers from the auction house for you by letting you roll need on them uncontested.
---
I'd say everyone sucks here. They're being douche bags by expecting bugs, but c'mon man, just buff your ally's. 
---
It's like giving a passing co worker that little "Hey" nod as you pass them in the hall or something.
---
Un'goro Crater. Dinosaurs! Dinoooosaurs!!!!
---
Deathknell.  The undead starting area is just so great.  You rise up/awaken and join the Foresaken.  Once the music starts to wash over me it feels like I'm home.
---
You play too much Pippin.
---
Wrong sub
---
There probably are alternatives but in my opinion it's worth it to pick it up.  It is a significant DPS increase and you dont have to rely on RNGesus dropping your item (and winning the roll).  The gold it costs you will easily be made up by having BiS gear all the way until T2pants/T1 gloves.
---
I know maybe it sounds ridiculous, but I've been 60 for almost a month now and am still running certain dungeons for gear that just wont drop.  As someone who also uses the Devilsaur set, it's nice to have at least 2 slots BiS right from 58 onward.
---
There are faster ways to make gold with less effort.
---
A lock that is relying on the healer to top them up is a bad lock. They can drink or eat while the rest of the group pulls, and they should always keep a stack of bandages on them.
---
Im in Darkshisper Gorge right now, it seems it's fixed on live classic wow. Or maybe I just suck?

SW AH, because thats where money is made.

All these comments about mages, rogues etc... getting tips.

Looks like im gonna start charging my party for tank repairs. If a mage using his portal once a dungeon is too much, the 3-6g i have to spend to repair at the end is way worse, and nobody ever offers to compensate tanks for it.
---
&gt; Wotf isn‚Äôt that big of a deal.
---
lmao yes it is. a melee can literally kill you in the 5 seconds of fear immunity depending on gear etc. vanilla is so bursty that negating one cc can actually lose you the fight.
---
I've completely avoided STV and Badlands for this reason. I don't lag but I also don't want to fight 500 people for quest items/mobs

Sunken Temple.  I can really appreciate the design of this dungeon.

I love the feel and creepiness of Duskwood.
---
So you're playing on an  EU server, living in an EU timezone? And  you want to find a server thats active  between the  hours of 2am and 10 am your time? I don't think server population is going to grossly effect density of play during the time where even nolifers stop and sleep?  Your best bet is to play a server in a zone that is offset so that your preferred playtime is prime time for that server.
---
Yes you will get less xp but getting carried in dungeons is more about knocking out the quest real fast or spamming them for the good boss drops to make leveling faster.
---
I like to get alts to like 18ish and then get full rested xp so I can do dungeons and just rotate my alts
---
You should see about organizing stealth only runs specifically to farm Anger for HOJ. If you are successful you should be able to hit the reset-cap and do 5 kills per hour ez.
---
Mana and mana regen are 100% useless unless youd go oom but dungeon fights should be shorter than raids.  Prioritize +healing and down rank more if anything I'd worry about having a bit more stam in dungeons where tanking can be spotty and people accidentally pull extra shit which will be running straight at you.

Mulgore. I was raised as a young Tauren cow boi in a simple village among the grassy plains. When I outgrew my mother's birthing saddle, I rode the skylift to Thunderbluff where I slowly became a young cow man, fraternizing with my fellow bovines, spending long afternoons fishing in communal bathing pond / latrine, and getting blasted on fermented milk in the crystal caves with heavy-uttered cow girls of questionable morals. After long expeditions in a dangerous and hostile world, I often feel a deep yearning in my meaty haunches to return my green grassy home. When I do, I gaze across the green expanse and feel at peace.

Idk about you but if someone needs on purpose that's enough for me to know where they win or not. Why wouldn't they get weeded out? Use my example. Mage rolls first, a need on boe plate. What more evidence do you need to determine they are a ninja?

&gt; if your into your tech

I am! And I much prefer actually listening to something engaging over music when commuting or doing mundane gaming task so I'm thrilled to find something new! Thank you!

There's a weird sense of unity to it. It's like going to the same high school.
---
Lol that isn‚Äôt even a far walk
---
They turned off layers roughly at that time I think.
---
Thanks for answering...what i'm really getting at though is endgame 5-mans like Scholo, Strat, LBRS, etc.
---
I know pre-raid BIS is what it is for Ony/MC...but I'm wondering if dungeons might ever want to leverage a higher mana pool versus the plus healing.
---
I'm also probably overthinking it.  Bad groups are going to be bad groups, even with a larger mana pool.
---
yes... at least trash and arena/first couple bosses
---
I took my first time playing GF into RFC yesterday, it was a disaster. I forgot to explain how dungeon groups work and that as a mage she'd be expected to sheep and didn't explain what raid icons are generally used for. It didn't help that she was only lvl 12 and I got disconnected almost immediately for about 10 minutes due to a battery problem on my laptop. In that 10 minutes a green dropped, another thing I forgot to explain, and she ended up accidentally rolling need and being chastised for the epic lvl 13 bracers that dropped. We'd mostly been communicating with each other outside of the game so she wasn't prepared or used to monitoring the chat box for party members communicating their intentions.
---
We ended up disconnecting and dropping the group because of how overwhelmed she got quickly and the damn troggs kept resisting her sheep while the party kept complaining that she wasn't even trying to sheep. It was a mess.
---
As someone who's played WoW and online games in general for so long I completely forgot how much has become just second hand nature that someone who's totally new to the genre wouldn't have even thought about. People need to remember that not everyone played this game 15 years ago, lots of people are completely new and for some it's their first MMO.
---
I havent won a roll on a single piece in MC in 3-4 runs.  Last run actually had a ton of priest gear drop.
---
Couple weeks ago i lost tier gloves on a 99.  It legitimately killed my will to play my priest for days.
---
Like...i know im not going to get loot every raid.  i know i have plenty of competition...but losing several pieces to people under 60, rolling under 30 most of the time, etc is all really frustrating.
---
Finally rolling a 99 and still losing was a kick in the balls.
---
And then that person won benediction last week.  *sigh*.

This is for classic, you need to be in retail sub

I put two people from LFG on ignore yesterday for spending half an hour publicly fighting out if one was a lootninja or the other a whiner... They were both spamming the wrong channel so bye :(

He's also in his pvp spec for your bg group.

Nope I‚Äôm unsure, but I think you can and just pay tax on the gains. It‚Äôs not like a 401K that you can essentially take a loan against.
---
Iirc i had 2-set t1, t2 hat and truefaith. I think shaman totems can work as long as they are buff ones, not dmg/healing/mana restore so like stoneskin, windwall etc. As long as shaman won't make any aggro it should be fine.

I am not saying the numbers are wrong, they are just not 100% guarenteed to be accurate.

Cool, thanks for the answer.  And yeah...i might be overthinking this.  Maybe instead of dwelling on gear I should prioritize finding better groups, bc healing 5-mans is a cake walk unless people start screwing up.

&gt;The greed button is gold coins because that's the button you click if you want an item just to sell it. Literally how the system was designed 14 years ago.

And the Need button is dice because that's the button you click if you want to...gamble? Or hmmmmm maybe the icon used doesn't wholly represent the function of the button.

The guide is oriented towards a newer playerbase and most of these players have no sense of how daze works let alone succesfully pulling packs into packs. Don't forget this requires good timing and a trust in your kit, both traits which lack in new players.

What the fuck are you talking about? How can you compare in-game transactions to out-of-game transactions?

I‚Äôm no expert, but I think mana may be an issue.

I mean, classic+ with some additional content, eventually leading to TBC would be cool but I don't see any logical progression that doesn't include it. I would be fine with keeping the combat/crafting/progression systems exactly how they are in vanilla, with the TBC content.

I misinterpreted your original comment. Rolling need when someone else who can‚Äôt use it rolls need first makes more sense. I just don‚Äôt like the idea of it being commonplace for everyone to roll need simply because of the monetary value, when someone who will use it, will use it.

It's entirely possible they purchased this enchant from another player.. it could have said Enchant Helm - Voracity in the trade window and they paid 100g or w/e to the enchanter for the service.. it's possible but unlikely.. Most likely operator error.

tfw tried to res those dumb mushrooms in WC. FUCK YOU DPS AND HEALS HARVESTING THOSE DUMB SHROOMS WHILE IM BUSY TANKING

After 5 WC runs i did throw a fucking hissy fit on the last run because i could never get a damn mushroom. But cooler heads prevailed, and we all just rolled on mushrooms. Plus we wiped a few times so everyone got them by the end lol

Anyone with half a brain? Do you really get a hard dick over dps meters on easy fights?
---
2 layers means two nodes one two magic parallel dimensions. 
---
One layer means one node on one magic planet. 
---
When you get rid of a layer the number of nodes drops by half. 
---
(Timers arent longer)
---
Sure the raids aren't hard by any means but saying you wont drop the gold on devilsaur because "you dont really need it" is the same as saying "why farm the rest of my BiS set if the raid is gonna get cleared anyways?" 
---
Grinding/buying your BiS is about helping your raid and pulling your weight in groups, no matter how easy they may be. 
---
If everyone had that mentality then it would be quite the frustrating of a raid group to be in.
---
Gem√ºse

I'm assuming you mean pvp realms. In US servers, Heartseeker is the most alliance dominated. There are several horde dominated servers, but from what I have heard Skeram and Stalagg are both exceptionally horde dominated. I have no idea what the faction ratios are in EU servers.
---
So a SM/Ruin. What pets are you gonna use? Is this for pvp, solo play, raiding?

STV
---
I like to say that tanking is a skill, not a spec. But you need to have at least one of them, and a lot of those 2h arms tanks have neither.
---
Get even.
---
What is this sorcery..
---
&gt;Spell Cleave is used because people just want mages and warlocks (fuck priests, shamans, and druids)
---
Spell cleave groups are usually priest+warlock+mages.  You want a priest for shielding the warlock's summoned eye so you can make big pulls.
---
Excellent commentary.  Somehow for me it's always a skull or more that jump me.
---
Something something its an MMO, something something you should be grouping up.

Fuck people that just log on to get some peace and quiet and quest alone, right?

It's around 450-500g for the set on Faerlina. It's amazing how massive of a price difference there is between servers.
---
I might have to keep LW for my guild, I‚Äôm the only 300 tribal LW, so they‚Äôd like me to grab corehound patterns for our Druid tank
---
But I‚Äôll definitely consider grabbing mining on whatever class I choose and hoarding the mats until I‚Äôm ready, not a bad idea at all
---
But that's not classic? I know they're useful QoL updates but they could have thrown them in Phase 2 maybe? At least let us have a genuine bit of classic.
---
Although even with it set to "classic" or "2" it is not the same as my private server/original changes. The way mobs spawn etc is different. Layering massively affects things like spawns of everything, although I appreciate that is going.
---
Don't get me wrong I'm happy with it and happy with the experience, but to say it's anything like the original is wrong.
---
If you fucking need it, roll need. That's my guild rules, fuck greedy-needy people.

Azhara.

I know , I know, but there's something that makes me feel at peace (In a PvP server) where I can just mount around and grab herbs/ores. I love the road u take to get the dowses and eventually swim for it. Its like a journey everytime.

Just make sure you need on a bow or gun that drops while ina group with that hunter for the stats aswell.
---
You probably more use then those new spellcleave mages!  Get off my lawn you whippersnappers!
---
The hunter is an idiot because there's a way better stat stick in DM North.
---
The item in OP doesn't have any spirit on it, though?
---
Spirit is also not nearly as good if you kite each mob to the next one to preserve rage and cut downtime. In my experience it's better to chainkill and then quickly heal to full, but everyone has a different playstyle and this is kinda offtopic anyway.
---
Don‚Äôt stress too much on raising and gear. Just enjoy the game and play. Go for other gear that‚Äôs good for your class rather than chasing the same BiS as every one else
---
This happened to me, and I died too.  So I had no idea what was happening when they looted the valor shoulders I was after...
---
Not sure, it's a pvp server but i play mostly early morning so thats probably why, SM is kinda dead for me as well!
---
I can‚Äôt answer your second question, but it‚Äôs not that people don‚Äôt trust shadow priests. It‚Äôs great to have one, but the problem is more than one is a waste. Shadow priests are also extremely mana inefficient, so you need to pop a lot of consumables to keep up. Your main job is to stack shadow weaving, which can be done with just 1 spriest.

yo can I get like a 10-12 word tl;dr on that mountain of text please
---
I feel like WoW2 is very possible. And at the very least, character achievements (mounts, titles, etc) would be ported, probably not characters themselves. 
---
Retail WoW is so cluttered right now. The game has just accumulated a mass of junk, and it is very hard for someone to return to the game from a break. I think at some point, Blizz will be forced to wipe the slate - and I think Classic was basically the confirmation that players kind of like simplicity and fresh starts. While many returned for the nostalgia, I feel like a lot returned because it was WoW in its simplest form. 
---
Current WoW can only handle a few more expansions until players get overwhelmed/bored. Unless they somehow manage to redesign the game to support so much content, it‚Äôll die off. Classic isn‚Äôt really original, so I would assume that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs dying off. We‚Äôve known the game for bloody decades, so it‚Äôs not like players are going to stick around toooo long. The wind down is very expected.
---
As for WHY Classic happened, I‚Äôd just say it was an obvious good business move. When your entire player base is begging for something that you already have created and sitting on the shelf, you might as well give it to them.
---
I‚Äôm a Druid healer and I have a warrior tank friend (uses 2h for this) we do dm e jump runs and split everything 60/40 as he is the miner in the group. We bring in a rogue every time and basically tell them they don‚Äôt get anything except the bow if it drops. Surprisingly a bunch of people are interested in this and a run takes about 15-20 minutes

Repeating it doesn't make you right.

I would've stayed Arms tbh. You can tank pretty much every dungeon in any spec provided you have some gear.
---
Only reason you'd spend points in prot is for raiding, otherwise you go ham in whatever you feel like going.
---
The hunter is an ass. As a hunter I would always give priority on a melee weapon to a Rogue or Warrior just as I would expect them to pass priority on a ranged weapon.

If you‚Äôre gonna give up because a hunter won his BiS weapon I recommend you go back to retail, mianly because you dont believe in yourself that if you keep running the dungeon, you might get that chance again.

I don't mess with people often... though the other night I felt a little cheeky. I saw an ally warlock summoning just outside of DM:N... and he had the GALL to be flagged. So I death coiled him into the instance and run in myself.

I don't think layers divide the population evenly- I'm pretty sure it's just when layer 1 is "full" then players are directed to layer 2 and so on.

If it‚Äôs not an upgrade for you and you‚Äôre not rolling with the intent to equip it then and there, you are in the wrong by rolling need over greed.

I'm with you on this, Skill is 80% of the raid/dungeon. 20% Equipment, I mean Nefarian withouth the Ony cape is at 60 as good as impossible, MC however I see myself with only 3-4 BiS and still having no problem as I just have to kick, blind, run at the good timings as rogue. A Tank with bad equip hower will have trouble I think, so classes also matter when regarding raid-preparedness.
---
Anyway, I hope you have much luck with your loot and group findings as I like your reasoning ! Lok'thar Ogar friend.
---
You lost buddy?
---
Wrong. BoE‚Äôs will definitely always be sold pre-60, so even if it‚Äôs a staff, what‚Äôs the use for it on a priest compared to a warrior? None really, however there is an actual advantage of needing it seems; eliminating ninjas.
---
I had the opposite reaction.... 
---
I tried doing the same thing the other night with mage water + soulstone / healthstone and some guy called me gay, which then led to other people laughing and doing the same thing. Never offering to trade conjured stuff b4 logging off again.
---
Duskwood, the atmosphere is just too amazing
---
Don‚Äôt know why you got downvoted. Twinking was a viable endgame alternative for people who didn‚Äôt have the time or commitment to raid back in actual Vanilla.
---
Now the barriers to entry on raiding aren‚Äôt seen as insurmountable, to casual players, they way they were. Since we all just have so much more experience with the game. So you can casually level to 60, join a guild, and expect to raid maybe 6 hours a week, if they‚Äôre good?
---
It makes twinking much less attractive.  Why grind up a lowbie toon, just to dominate in BGs, when you have *actual* progression you could do on your main, while still having time to have a life irl. 
---
In addition, people on average aren‚Äôt leveling alts fast enough, to provide fodder for those twinks. So even if you decide to gear one up when BGs hit, you likely will only be competing against other overgeared twinks. 
---
Not to say we won‚Äôt see any twinks. But I doubt it‚Äôll be anywhere near as strong as it was. People planning to make thousands on twink items are likely in for a rude awakening.

It‚Äôs still the most popular MMO on the market. The sky isn‚Äôt falling. They would be dumb to ‚Äúwind down‚Äù this cash cow. They just reported their largest earnings quarter in history. Proving they don‚Äôt need Sub count to make money. They are catering to casuals and whales and it‚Äôs working for them. 
---
If we see a WoW 2 it will be a Cataclysm 2.0 with a level squish. Not a stand alone new IP. This game is so far from dead. EQ is still coming out with expansions dude and they haven‚Äôt been relevant in the major market in more than 12 years.
---
I can confirm that these shortened spawn times started on Kurinnaxx about two weeks ago
---
I love Duskwood. The ambiance, the unknown, the fear all of it is just amazing. It is exactly how I remember it 14 years ago and create alliance characters purely for that zone.
---
The Barrens! Redridge and Stormwind are a close second.
---
Didnt even know this spec had a name sm ruin I'm super unfamiliar with lock I just messed around the talent calc and this came out as the most logical spec.
---
I love to make specs that while not being optimal in any of the games facets, does just well enough to not have to respec every week
---
On top of the Orgrimmar bank. So much time spent there.
---
Ironforge is by far my favourite place. So warm and cozy. Also so many people there is a true feeling of community just sitting there with everyone else
---
You can only have one Renew and one Rejuvenate at a time.
---
How do you know how much xp your getting an hour at 60?
---
The difference in gear from 59 to 60 is insane.
---
You need to work on your click bait.
---
So is this just an opinion or are you losing raid spots or you're not getting into dungeons because you're a rogue? I don't think as a rogue you'll lose your spot to fury warrior or mage unless of course you don't know how to maximize your dps.
---
I don't think you should worry about all this unless of course if you don't really like playing as a rogue.
---
As a mage without Ice Barrier or CS, it's hell when you pull 3 Casters... (Polymorph won't save you either)

wut?

There's nothing grammatically incorrect with that statement, clown. It's calling you a clown who can't argue said point (said meaning the previously mentioned point in my post, if that's what's confusing your uneducated ass). Keep trying to avoid defending your moronic point though, it just makes it THAT much more stupid :)
---
Sounds like your guild has no direction other than what suits themselves nor does it seem like it has a structure.  A more of an 'anything goes'.
---
I would inquire where they plan to go forth with loot distribution and prioritization and see if they can scrub the whole 'reserve' nonsense UNLESS it's something that is a direct benefit for that player to do their role FOR THE GUILD.
---
As a side note, all weapons are hunter weapons joke aside, Hunters should be looking to get 2handers for the sole reason that dual wielding for them is awful if for whatever reason they are in a dual wield scenario.  Some 2handers have beefier stats and their hit cap for range is much lower than dual wielding.
---
The Undercity, because power to the forsaken!
---
Ironforge will never not be amazing
---
Well, had they been faction exclusive they could have been more mirrors or each other than they ended up.
---
Darkshire in Duskwood. Always liked the spooky atmosphere and the awesome quest lines!
---
&gt;I wish the legacy community would stop pretending that thier is a massive amount of mutual hatred between vanilla and current wow fan bases.
---
m8, you couldn't discuss Classic anywhere without someone popping in to proclaim that it's "just nostalgia" and "dead in x weeks/months".
---
Ever since Classic was announced, there was a non-stop shitposting train of people doomsaying that the game is going to "fail".
---
Sadly I am a Warlock so I just cast water breathing on everyone as I run past...
---
That dwarf fell for the fact that he needs to dismount before stealth a couple times.
---
He even says in several of his videos that people are gonna run with the idea that furyprot is viable. He reiterates several times that his furyprot builds are for ph.2+
---
The problem with that theory is that Warlocks weren't a D&amp;D class until November 1st 2004 (23 days before WoW came out, so long after the Warlock class were developed) and they're utterly different from WoW warlocks in just about every possible way. There's absolutely no connection between WoW's warlocks and D&amp;D's other than them sharing a name.
---
Drizzt is a dual wielding swordsman, and fights with a pet. He's actually surprisingly similar to Rexxar in that regard. Pretty much nothing about him says WoW hunter, until very recent books he never shot a bow (and even then it's not his bow). Rangers are clearly similar to hunters in execution, but D&amp;D rangers traditionally have access to nature magic in some form, which doesn't fit either.
---
While D&amp;D's influence on WoW is undeniable, because it's influenced every RPG since the 1970's, the claim that WoW's classes are based on them rather than Warcraft lore is an extremely indefensible reach.
---
Someone on Pagle-US kited Teremus all the way to the Ironforge AH bridge. That must have taken hours.
---
It's bis pve and PvP. It's just a gold sink the majority of the time.
---
I paid right around 230g for mine, I bought the mats from the AH over a period of time so was able to get the devilsaur leather for a little bit cheaper.  I'd say 250g is well worth the investment, especially if you can get it as soon as you can use it.  It'll help you get to 60 and serve you well for quite some time.
---
Nice horde pve server
---
Molten Core. Ragnaros is my favorite WoW boss and my first experience was watching my brother raiding back in 2005 which got me into WoW. Going back in there today brings back a ton of good memories.
---
Wait what?
---
How does this work?
---
Only with macro?
---
Oh fuck off with this nonsense. He lost a 3% drop chance item to someone who could replace said item in less than an hour of dungeon grinding. OP's qualms are completely valid and I would be considering finding a more reasonable guild as well.
---
If at any point they purposefully use the similarity in name to harass or try to smear the reputation of your guild you can put in a ticket for a forced name change. If they don't though, it is allowed.
---
They will sure as shit notice when it aggos the trash pack you are trying to skip.
---
One last suggestion - Having a UI option that allows you to filter posts by "LFG", "LFM", "LFxM" (X being a configurable threshold), or "Both" would be amazing. There are times where I want to run a dungeon but don't feel like handling the drudgery of building the group, or other times where I'm building a group and have to keep mentally filtering posts for the same dungeon from another group.
---
You must not do a lot of dungeons then because 'Need All BoEs is a very common loot rule in Classic. If this bothers you so much perhaps it's you who would be better off playing retail, where this sort of thing can't happen.
---
And get it through your head mate, it's not about fattening one's wallet, it's about upgrading one's character.
---
Un'goro crater would be my favorite.
---
Tried to watch this series but the host is so damn robotic and awkward. He always seems miserable.
---
Need if you need, greed if you dont. Its not a hard concept. You did nothing wrong
---
Druid here i respeced to tank that i said look im only going if i can roll on reed they masterlooted right before boss i pulled the entire room and loom the durability loss sorry bros.
---
we're talking about it at this very moment so it worked.
---
The microphone will move for you.
---
Well you are wrong
---
Retail dead
---
Westfall, for that good old western experience on the east coast.
---
I played on the server lagwin in wotlk. Aegwynn  was 100% alliance side and the tradechat scrolled so fast you couldn't even read it. The server even lagged in empty citys like darnasus
---
Auberdine. And I'm horde. &gt;:D
---
They mentioned his new netflix series.
---
Well said.
---
I didn't know, that's why my response was a subdued "yikes", because that's an awful possibility.
---
The Witchblade + Offhand is still better tho.
---
41, almost 42 priest, shadow spec - fairly casual player. I have yet to run anything in Scarlet Monastery. Is it even worth it for me at this point? I've heard that some of the loot is really good but it doesn't seem to be very cloth/priest focused
---
if its a vendor pattern the tip will be much lower, if its a rare pattern with a specialty requirement and close to 300 req skill then you should be tipping a few gold.  it cost them a ton of time and materials to level up thier profession
---
So just wear nothing then. Because why not.
---
My favorite place is the graveyard in STV, if we judging by the place I‚Äôve spent the most time üñ§
---
Okay, first time wow player here. But isnt dal rend bis for hunters too? I think I‚Äôm missing something. Someone please point it out gracefully
---
Blackrock mountain, some of my favourite moments in pvp and pve have been there
---
Darnassus has always been so damn cool to me. I love the merge of nature and architecture. It‚Äôs such a shame nobody is ever there.
---
Veeeerry nice thank you for the protip
---
Why are you so bad at wow? Oh right, so you can whine about others making money while you suck at it.
---
Rogues have guaranteed raid spots in just about any guild. Not sure why you feel like they don't just because fury warriors can top the meters when the boss hits 20% hp.
---
Remote Desktop question: Has anyone else‚Äôs been messed up lately?
---
I used to be able to Remote Desktop (chrome Remote Desktop) via my phone and fairly easily play with a slightly reduced frame rate. Now this week it is freezing nearly every time I log into WoW. 
---
Any way to fix this?
---
Only would be against ToS if you can prove they're using that name specifically to harass or impersonate you. 
---
It's not exactly an uncommon or original guild name,  so doubt there's anything blizz would do.
---
Booty Bay and by extension Strangle Thorn Vale
---
It's where true warriors were made predator style in the jungle, BB is also the first true neutral city factions access as well
---
M8 you‚Äôre dead wrong. Please tell me that fury tanking let alone prot tanking is like that and I‚Äôll prove you wrong. There are multiple abilities to keep up with, not to mention watching swing timer to queue and unqueue my HS to increase my white hits. Warrior has a very high skill ceiling in classic actually. I played Hunter and Mage all the way through MoP and this rotation/priority is certainly more difficult to max.
---
That explains the comment section of 90% of the web.
---
I‚Äôm going to respectfully disagree. Who do you think buys those purple boe items in the first place if you think nobody is intending to equip them pre-60?
---
That‚Äôs just objectively incorrect.
---
50 seconds of waiting should not be added to the travel time. You take the highest possible time for speed runs like this in order to compare them. You are not spending more time moving while waiting for the tram. You could've been alt tabbed hence pausing the time, not requiring you to move as fast.
---
I actually agree - it does come off a little like that. Sorry.
---
I've never quit on a group. I try my best to have patience as not every player plays like I do - but this group pushed me to my limit. The tank would just stand around waiting for direction, so I started marking targets. At one point, I bear tanked mobs just to keep us moving forward - we seemed to stop after every pull, even if we all had full MP and HP.
---
It took nearly 3 hours. Uldaman. 3 hours.
---
Yea that would be a waste of 2 points thank you for theprotip
---
So, looking at the build you posted, I would say you should finish off imp CoC, and put the rest into shatter, and then get ice barrier at 40 of course. As you said, ice shards gives you very little value since you almost never crit right now anyway. And the only time you are going to start using spells that crit is likely going to be when they are nova'd. 
---
Also, I believe your math is a bit off there for how much damage you would get from ice shards. You have a 5% chance to crit for 50% extra damage right now without the talent. So the average of your hits and crits for a 100 damage spell would be 102.5. Putting 5/5 into ice shards makes it 105. So you increase your damage by less than 2.5% if you take those talents. 
---
105/102.5 = 1.0244
---
2.44% damage. For 5 talent points.
---
This sounded super cool so I played with it. However the only cities I see as options are capitals (Darnassus, Stormwind, Orgrimmar, etc). Is there another way to find a longer list or write in a name?
---
A E S T H E T I C
---
I'll be farming 1k gold in my next video, AND GIVING IT AWAY TO LOW LEVEL PLAYERS. Hooray for no more layering on Grobbulus!
---
Forever Booty Bay. Its a safe haven from the madness that awaits outside in the (pvp)jungle.
---
They actually are BiS, you're forgetting enchants. But it's only by a teeny weeny tiny margin.
---
South Shore
---
I wouldn't pay for it.  Just run the dungeon a few times and hope for the best. If you don't get it there's better in DM, so no worries.
---
&gt; Cause I played everyday and kept an eye on the queue.
---
Of course you do. What are you going to do? Play the trash that is retail?
---
Top kek
---
Or they don't want whiny kids in their group.
---
All classic classes are 1-5 buttons MAX
---
?
---
I just wanted my affliction/DOT Warlock back.
---
Retail Warlock is nothing like I started with. I feel like a walking air-craft carrier deploying squadrons of fighters. What's going on in the battle? I have no idea, I'm just gathering my next wing to launch.
---
Greeding valuble drops and opening yourself up to getting ninjaed because you're caught up on semantics isn't a virtue, that's the definition of stupid.
---
Speaking of 2 Rings... Mages, get your Freezing Bands before they increase in price when Ranking PvP comes out. You won't find a better Ring for a Frost Mage in PvP!
---
This is playing your own character... it‚Äôs helps you learn your binds, rotation, priorities and also allows you to focus on other mechanics more easily. There‚Äôs a reason why a lot of method players use MaxDPS despite being PvE gods. Prot and Fury tanking has a very high skill ceiling. Much higher than Hunter and Mage through MoP retail.
---
&gt; there's no gnomish tinkerers
---
If the new expansion leaks are true there soon will be
---
What?  I would've thought this was a popular opinion.
---
I mean, venoxis will stay filled also. :')  
---
Its the 2nd largest server and people who just wanna log in to a full server without queue (or 30 min queue at max.) went there.
---
What would you accept as proof without actually revealing how I made the gold?
---
Actually any class can go through trogg tunnel without dying level 1. Source : Gnome race we did in the guild
---
Gold lol
---
Orgrimmar, the quintessential home away from home.
---
The guild bank takes stuff out of 5-man dungeon runs? I've never heard of this before...
---
But theyre not touching leeway? Fuck. That.
---
TL;DR - His dad taught him how to play. He had fun. He stopped in MoP. He remade his old character when classic came out. Nostalgia.
---
Winterspring at night, the ambiance is peaceful and relaxing and you feel like you are in a complete different world.
---
Is this how it's supposed to work?.. because it doesn't work like that.
---
You can run arena and maybe anger.  Once your 54 you should be good for full clears
---
Devilsaur prices going down doesn't ruin the economy
---
Ooooohh sweet summer child
---
I think SM cathedral is still fine for you to run. It has a few pieces of decent gear for you too. I use Atlasloot addon to check gear in dungeons.
---
It IS dead though...
---
Wow ! Thank you very much for your time! I now understand well, have a good day/night :Da
---
there‚Äôs good stuff in the library and the cathedral. people often wear it into the 50s. 
---
I like this site: https://itemization.info/?search=source%3A%22scarlet+monastery%22+has%3Aint
---
edit: plus, the SM is really fun to run!
---
Tanks charging for runs isn't exactly uncommon...
---
Very accurate, would be perfect if he made a little mistake and 10 angry orcs came in the hall
---
Zul'Farrak! Such a fun dungeon. The first time I ran the stair event will forever be burned in my mind!
---
Why would you go that big on your comp and not get the 9900k? Clearly budget wasn't an issue...
---
Helps to do this when you're a mage.
---
Is a level 30 warlock appropriate for gnomeregan? Struggling to find if that‚Äôs too low or not. Thanks! :)
---
I was waiting for the wipe that never came...
---
Level 50+ zones are such a sharp contrast from STV, Arathi, and Hillsbrad. Most of the opposing faction players I encounter in the upper level zones on my PVP server are surprisingly peaceful. We politely wait for quest mobs to respawn and don't steal each other's tags, and we even implicitly divide farming spots without resorting to PvP.
---
I guess a lot of people just want to get over with the grind at this stage instead of endlessly ganking each other.
---
Int does nothing for pvp. You're going oom in those fights with mana gems.
---
I'll send you a message as long as you're not on Atiesh
---
Almost crashed Org on Skeram last night. Not sure I'd call it natural.
---
Going up the elevator to Thunder Bluff, especially for the first time. As a Tauren, your first experience with a town / village is Bloodhoof village, which consists of a few tent houses. As you ascend the elevator, you have no idea the scope and size of the Tauren capital city (since you can't see much from the ground).
---
Yeah early mornings would do that for you.  If you started sometime towards the afternoon leading into prime time I would imagine it would be easy to get groups especially with how close it is to a main city.
---
I just dinged 40 last night (warrior), I was hoping to be 60 before then, but I'll take what I can get..right?
---
I read it in a post earlier.
---
Will try and find some sort of concrete confirmation and post my findings.
---
But I believe it affects servers that have recently been ‚Äòde-layered‚Äô. Like you said, de-layering a server essentially halves the available resource nodes to the player base (everything, not just devilsaurs) and that is something they are trying to counteract with a slight increase in spawn rates. 
---
You would expect all de-layered servers to go through a sudden doubling of prices. Remember, even with just 1 layer, the dynamic spawn rates are influenced by player population, so if all the players are now on 1 layer, that layer will have more players and will increase the spawn rates across the board.
---
My favourite area is Feralas. It's beautiful, mystical and have great lore. Also gives (alliance) the most awesome pet, a cute little fiery dragon!
---
Lakeshire. Because of the music and scenery.
---
My favorite location is Molten Core.
---
Mine is at UC but you've convinced me to switch...
---
It's about 10% from the pyromancers, iirc. I generally see at least one every 3 runs or so, and once we got two in one run.
---
Ummm it in fact does us up your nightfall proc
---
This guy Zul'Farraks.
---
I can't find anything about Kevin James in relation to Hot Ones.
---
All city's in wow are more like a representation and not the actual size. The "empty" parts are alleys and other parts of the city's we can't access. I'm quite sure some dev also said that. I will search the source and come back.
---
It's the same as lock summons , you never tip the lock in your group but if you want to hassle a lock who you aren't completing content with then you should pay them
---
Yea, I did that too.  Had to navigate using the mini map.
---
Warriors can dps yeah but i prefer to have my dps warrs tanking instead. Why you ask. Well its faster to have them tank than spending 30mins finding a tank.  I guess you could have a warr dps if theres already a tank in the group. Priest can dps but wouldnt you rather pick a mage for ez aoe or warlock for strong single and also good aoe?
---
No one's doubting that an addon that tells you how to play the game is good.  Luckily no such addon exists in classic so you'll just have to play your own character.
---
It's not about being active but the difference between finding a dung group in an hour VS literally no activity. I play BFA at the same time zone but even as a dps, dung queues are reliable. EU prime time is pretty sweet for me the problem is just that it useally doesnt last much longer than 6 hours the last week and a half
---
Lmao this drawing fucking sucks.
---
Exactly, warlocks aren't worth buffing for another year (P4 at least, P5 recommended) and bringing a SP at this point is just gimping your raid. 
---
People can play however they like but they also have to stop trying to justify bringing a class that will not increase efficiency. The class is viable but also aceept that unless you're (not you specifically but thr people in this sub) already farming Ragnaros you're piggybacking.
---
Depends on guild and situation.
---
Generally just get either the in dreams chest or deathbone for mitigation.
---
For your threatbuild savage glad is bis, even for maintanking.
---
You collect the set and maybe use it for bonuses, but it's more likely to take up space in your bank while you are out raiding with you mismatch of bis gear.
---
Winterspring is my favorite zone in WoW classic. It just feels really peaceful there...that being said, I always found great pvp there. You're close to the end of leveling which makes it special too.
---
Wowhead guides don't exactly have a great rep, so I wouldn't trust them too much. And a lot of people don't understand mechanics in WoW. Some people probably think that ice shards gives you 250% damage on crit because of the way it's worded.
---
Another explanation could be that, when going for a single target build, you usually take ice shards and frostbite early on so that you can get more value out of shatter when you get to level 25. So they're just in the habit of taking ice shards before shatter? 
---
Those are the only possible reasons I can think of. I agree with you though, it doesn't make any sense to take ice shards before shatter in a full-aoe build.
---
There are only a few profiles available and they‚Äôre not very good. This means I‚Äôll have to waste a few hours to set everything up, when I‚Äôd rather download something attuned for this. Seriously I‚Äôm just asking a simple question, thanks for the WeakAuras suggestion, but I‚Äôm already aware of this and trying to avoid the setup.
---
Warriors are very rarely better tanks than druids.
---
Savage Gladiator would probably be the best option if you feel like farming it.
---
Had the wrong instance, meant black rock spire.  
---
Voons gauntlet, also they're mail lmao so ignore me.  
---
Just hunter things.
---
Hey dude I feel bad for you stupid hunter, next time a good stat bow drops need that ish. Anyways, I‚Äôm thinking of getting the thrash blade , how has it been performing for u? I‚Äôm level 48 now and was thinking of getting crusader enchant on it since I‚Äôll probably be using it til 60 like u. Any suggestions?
---
And yeah you should build a gearset for both scenarios to swap around.
---
Dwarf anythings are best anythings
---
Make some weakauras that suit your needs
---
Pretty cool. I'm the dad in the dad/son WoW relationship. When AV first came out, I let him play my guy for hours and he was only 5. He loved it. He's 19 now and an excellent player. I do pretty well myself ha. We're both all kinds of ready for phase 2 worldwide massacre. For your dad starting at 60 though, good choice on the server. It sounds like he's already becoming famous.
---
Once you get to the hit cap, yes Crit&gt;
---
Tarnished Elven Ring + Painweaver is pre-raid BiS for enhance shammies, so you chose correctly.
---
The neatplates (Kinda like the classic version of tidyplates) addon. Works great, been using it since day one.
---
Is it possible to do that as holy, or do you have to be shadow?
---
dat +crit xD
---
only specific types of stuns do that
---
Question about pre-raid BiS for a Prot warrior.
---
I was running BRD arena farms the other day and I was talking about how I saw the Savage Gladiator chain drop on my fourth run and a I lost it to a hunter and how upset I was about it. 
---
Side note: Itemization kind of stinks in classic, there's zero reasons on why a hunter and prot warrior should share pre-raid BiS.
---
I play Alliance, and he said "why? It's ONLY pre-raid BiS for horde for the windfury proc meta" he was a warrior too so I don't know if he was trying to get a better shot at it by convincing me I don't need it? But I haven;t seen any Faction specific pre-raid BiS lists? Like I know certain factions get certain BiS from faction specific quests but it's not just BiS for horde right? 
---
wow, can't believe I took a short answer and made this mess.
---
Blackrock Spire.  So many dungeons and a cool zone design concept.
---
Wowglider was pretty cool... rip my first account lol
---
And I mostly hung around the MMO-C classic forums; even in there, almost every single thread had people doomsaying that the game was going to "fail" and "dead in X months", going full-on armchair psychologist to try and make up reasons why the game is bad and everyone will quit.
---
I know you got downvoted in other posts but your mentality is the same as me and the majority of players that play the game, so dont feel bad. I dont know why on Reddit these manlets think they're entitled the a possible new piece of gear when its the same for everyone. To reiterate what you said, the main issue is that too many "accidents" happen on BOEs whether you can use it or not, cant count how many times one person needs immediately and then forces everyone else to. Why not just everyone need and then its like rolling on a chest? Makes zero fucking sense, Reddit's hivemind on this is low IQ and zero common sense fueled.
---
Install Pawn addon, find proper weights for stat for prot warrior and add them there.  
---
Now you will be able to see what items are better for tanking!  
---
And it will definitely show you that armor is better than hit, past specific values.
---
P.S. You could also add Fury DPS weights, to check your DPS gear.
---
Too bad, you could layer hop if Ony head was on CD on your layer.
---
Winterspring - always had a soft spot for snow levels and love how its sort of the ultimate questing area and the end of your leveling journey before hitting 60
---
The Salty Sailor Tavern in Booty Bay.  We offer a variety of select craft beers from our guild, the Booty Bar Brewing Co.
---
Searing Gorge! To me it feels like if in the Lord of the Rings, the evil forces won and Isengard set up some industrial pits in Mordor lol. Just a really cool vibe to it.
---
My parents went to Ony Lair and all I got was butt hurt
---
This.  Also the OG cinematic has a dwarven rifleman as the hunter character. 
---
Makes sense for NEs to be hunters as well.
---
I don't think that would make you a dickhead, moreover inconsiderate. The issue here being that the item in question is much more useful to a rogue or fury warrior, if not the single most important piece of gear for those classes. There are not suitable replacement weapons for rogues. There are in fact suitable and better (and easier to get) alternatives for hunters. I would prioritize letting those melee DPS classes get the weapon if I were you, and then go for it.
---
The damage is so negligible since if you are pvping you are specced into MM for scatter trap. 
---
The 1.10, 1,07 and 1.0 scales for damage does not really matter. You trade negligible damage for some survivability. You are mostly looking for spellpushback.
---
I have zg bats on number one for their 1.0 attackspeed, 1.07 damage and 1.0 hp/Armor. Pet stays alive longer = more pushback.
---
Screech has nothing to do with it. It‚Äôs nice for farming. It‚Äôs purely a human factor. It‚Äôs more annoying to have a bird/bat flap in your face then having a cat slapping your ankle.
---
That‚Äôs why I have spiteflayer over swamp jags and deathmaw or similar 1.2 pets.
---
Payment is if someone asked for water and I said, yeah 1g etc. A tip is recognition of the time/money saved for the service you‚Äôre providing as a mage. Hey maybe you don‚Äôt value your time playing as much as I do. But I didn‚Äôt choose mage to be water fountain.
---
????????????????????
---
Then they can't equip it yet can they?
---
step 1: dont run dungeons anymore with that moronic hunter/warrior
---
step 2: run ubrs until you have the shoulders and ring, if you dont have the sword mh by then just buy krol blade(300g is really not that significant since you can mine in silithus as rogue)
---
No why is my whole group half hp after a pull in a dungeon lol.  I keep my group topped off my only concern is them not pulling fast enough.   If I'm sitting down you're good to pull
---
I feel you. My lag in Shattrath was so bad that it took me multipule attempts to complete the Scryer/Aldor escort. I had to look at the ground and would lose track of him when my PC locked up.
---
lmfao my brother is heals and i‚Äôm a lock and he will do this shit if i‚Äôm tapping while he‚Äôs drinking and i could be too
---
I've always played by making it fair for everyone. Any BOEs Blues+ that drop, I always tell everyone to Need. Everyone is better off selling it, even if you actually need it. IMO if you personally use a BOE item while leveling you're losing out on the extra cash. Twinking is a little different.
---
Tanaris, the music and atmosphere
---
I got paid to do them all for a hunter after I had did mine, 20g each demon, that was pretty sweet! You could always try and offer that service out, but, dont know why any hunter would do that to themselves.
---
I agree, or at least be appreciative.
---
They are doing it now, bring more  Horde to Anathema!
---
This is fantastic lol
---
It's level 55 btw. I plan to buy mine as soon as my rogue turns 55.
---
2 weeks tops before everyone goes crawling back to Retail
---
How do you even function in the real world with this level of cognitive dissonance lmao. Do you not understand that giving everyone a fair shot at a piece of loot is the exact opposite of greedy? And expecting others to pass on it so you and only you can roll on the item is the actual definition of greedy?
---
Whatevs, keep denying reality all you want mon frere, I'll continue successfully running dungeons where everyone gets a fair shot at the loot they helped find.
---
Yeah, it was written by some casual from this sub lmao, cause thats not it.
---
Coming soon lol
---
In my parent comment I mentioned retail, just so you know. Hardiness is good but I‚Äôd rather have shadowmeld as an ‚Äúoh shit‚Äù button (still talking about retail).
---
definitely been feeling like I lack threat. most of my gear is mitigation based, I can take a ton of dmg but have trouble keeping threat if my teammates are rockin and rollin with dps.
---
specific realms can transfer to other specific realms
---
Now that DM is out, Kromcrush's Chestplate is probably the go-to tanking chest pre-raid: [https://classicdb.ch/?item=18503](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18503)
---
Looking to lvl a Pally alt more or less through dungeons only. I'm thinking of going 11 into Holy for Consecration, then dumping the rest in Prot. If I do this and carry an int/healing + set, will I be able to heal 5 mans decently or will I be forced into doing mostly tanking only? What about the opposite? If I dump a bunch of points in Holy, would I be able to tank w/ a stam/str set?
---
ok
---
Me too man, I really want the ally to flourish so it makes for some good wPvP. That's why I refuse to kill any lowbies I run by on my 60.
---
I might achieve the same, except I level them simultaneously(currently 40, 42 and 43) for that sweet sweet rested XP.
---
That‚Äôs good to hear (that the issue was resolved not that you were banned)  I hope they are able to fix this soon.
---
No this is not what you need to do. The Nightfall will reduce the cast time of your "next" shadowbolt by 100%. The current shadowbolt will not be effected and the next shadowbolt will be instant. It's hard to see sometimes and will appear that only one shadowbolt has been casted. However it will be two separate shadow bolt damages if you check the combat logs.
---
&gt; prot tanking
---
Shield Block on CD, keep Shouts and Thunder Clap up, Sunder Armor spam, Revenge on proc, then Shield Slam and Heroic Strike/Cleave if you have extra Rage.
---
It's not rocket surgery.
---
I thought this too but a guy in my guild also got one off of the Satyrs in Felwood.
---
The Barrens. For the chat and for mankrik
---
Well that sucks
---
Valueable items like this should be needed by everyone in the group. Everyone can sell it and buy whatever other epic drop they want.
---
I'm currently level 37. Undead Mage with fishing at 150+ and Alchemy and Herbalism at 200+.  I'm sitting at 40 gold so I have some work to do to get my mount.  How did you farm for gold to get your mount? Any and all recommendations welcome.
---
I was playing during wrath when they broke the API for AVR. I was even using it myself as a raid lead for sindragosa. And I remember they stated that they disallowed it to read x/y/z coordinates. But I've been looking at warcraftlogs and there is a "replay" function on every log that basically shows a 2D replication of player movement during the fights. The game seems to be still recording the coordinates of players in real time at least to the combat logs. Whether or not you can use that to put heals above peoples' heads I am not sure.
---
Warriors start to go ahead late aq and early naxx due to crazy weapons that drop. 
---
Also warriors are much stronger on horde due to wf, that‚Äôs why I point out in alliance.

I dont think there's really enough info you say whether or not you should stay in your guild. Do you like these people? Do you hand out in discord and shoot the shit with them? Do you enjoy grouping up and running dungeons with them? Do you share in the celebrating with them when one of them gets a win? Then you should stay. 
---
On the other hand, if you don't really care about them as people, and feel resentful when one of them got a toy you wanted, then maybe you should leave. And also you should realize that this feeling will follow you no matter which guild you join because no matter what, hunters, druids and warriors are gong to be rolling on your loot and winning it out from under you for as long as you play this game.
---
Wintersprings, I just love the whole Zone.
---
The idea of farming dungeons is to make each one take \~12 minutes so that you can just fit 5 in within an hour due to that being the reset cap.  So ideally, you want to be as efficient within those 12 minutes as possible.  If that means clearing a bunch of trash to vendor grays (like private server lasher farming in DM) then so be it, but if the trash drops aren't as efficient as the drops from the bosses, it makes sense to skip as much trash as possible so you can maximize your gold/hr killing the bosses.  Also remember that bag space is an issue, and you don't want to be filling your bag slots with low value items because it means you have to vendor sooner.
---
Why is it called spellcleave? Cleave is a melee term. Shouldnt spellcleave also apply to warrior whirlwind groups (especially with windfury)
---
Wait so your saying to keep an argent dawn valor token handy so when the pattern of archmage drops, you can Need it, and act like you just learned it? :sideways smile:
---
Great episode aswell!
---
Not the worst thing I did, but yesterday I saw an ally hunter attacking Caliph Scorpidsting in Tanaris.  I ganked him cause I needed Scorpidsting for my own quest.
---
As a mage I used to buff every person I ran past, or would stand in town and say on general that I was there ready with tasty snacks and buffs for anyone who opened trade, but then you learn higher and higher ranks and 1 int buff is like 30% of my mana and I'm conjuring like 2 bottles of water at a time I gave that up lmao,
---
In dungeons  I actually have to tell them to give me 5min because the process of buffing 5 players and crafting 40 waters for myself and heals + 20 for any other class that uses mana is just brutal. Luckily though people are very understanding and happy to save like 5g on water

This is what SW looked like at the same time. It's definitely overpopulated with Horde but it's not that bad yet.
---
What youre saying is the gold value of the item is worth more than the item which is why you havent bought it already.
---
Well thats the same for everyone else in the group too. Thats why everyone gets to roll. Glad you understand.
---
Warlocks are somewhat evil, thats why Warlock-Trainers are always hidden in some basement.
---
You realize I‚Äôm majorly trying to learn my rotation correct? One that is not 1-5 buttons and is much more difficult than many retail rotations I‚Äôve played. Maxing is completely different from killing easy content. I‚Äôm trying to max on a class with a higher skill ceiling which is competent different.
---
This was my point all along, thanks so much for actually being decent at putting your words together!
---
If you want to play like on retail, why don't you just play on retail?
---
There are a lot of answers here with misleading info... I'll try to clarify as briefly as I can.
---
If you enter a RAID dungeon and a boss is already dead, you should get a warning that you will be saved if you do not leave within 1 minute. It doesn't matter if you helped kill it or not, you could get saved.
---
If you enter a dungeon with people and kill a bunch of trash, but no bosses, you will not be saved.
---
Somebody mentioned Onyxia causing a save if she's been pulled, so watch for that. I cannot confirm.
---
What does it mean to be saved to an instance of that RAID?  Well, it means the dungeon remains as it was when you left it, or whoever last killed stuff left it, with the exception of trash respawns. If there are, say 5 bosses, and you've killed trash all the way up to the last one, but don't kill the last boss, the trash immediately before that boss will respawn, but not the trash before the other bosses. 
---
So if the RAID has been completely cleared out, when you enter it there will usually be no trash mobs and obviously no boss.  That means if you have quests to do in a RAID dungeon, you may be able to save yourself to somebody else's instance to do those quests. This is assuming you don't need to or have the chance to clear that dungeon for the week.
---
Resets. I'm not entirely sure how this works in Classic, but I think most RAIDs (except Onyxia) reset Tuesday at 12:01am server time. (That is, Monday night is the last night you can realistically try to finish up an incomplete raid.)  That's worth clarifying, but most people don't raid right up until the lockout resets so isn't usually an issue. This means that Tuesday morning you can start the dungeon over. All the bosses and trash will be reset as if you hadn't stepped in there before.
---
I think that the item is currently selling for way more than it's worth and you'd be insane to expect people you pug with to pass up on 1k gold so you can have a purple. If you farm your gold through DME jump runs you may even find it yourself.
---
I at least try for the lesser invis, in hopes it helps with rogues.  But other then that I hate how my "buffs" are not much of a boon.  But hey, I have toilet cookies, and nobody else can do that!
---
Silverpine Forest. Soloing an Elite as a low level warlock back in the day was very satisfying.
---
I mean, that's an argument one could have (that Warlocks are themselves baggage outside of the necessary few for Banishes, so therefore Spriests are baggage). But it's a separate argument from the one first presented, which is that Spriests don't get two debuffs. I get two debuffs to work with, and I'm one of my guild's top parsers on any fight that doesn't involve me spamming Dispel with the Holy Priests. Undoubtedly this is the case because many DPS in my guild are merely "above average", while my own parses are top 10th percentile, but even if that's the dedication an Spriest needs to show, not all of them are raid leeches.
---
Ret Paladins, on the other hand...
---
I do not believe layering effects que times, well, not directly.  Possibly more people hopped on last night after the server realized that most of the layering had been turned off.
---
I think people are comparing it to the fact that the first time it was released it grew steadily for 6 years
---
Human male?
---
It's not 50g/hour, not even close.
---
My insight is to not let what random people on the internet say bother you. Comment was pretty innocuous anyway, just saying you shouldn't need that since I'll be able to hold aggro
---
2handed soft critcap is a lot higher than duelwield due to not having a miss chance. For 9% hit with 300 weapon skill the hitcap is 58.3%
---
I feel that. Ran it 16 times and it dropped once. Shaman and I rolled on it and I rolled a 1. Part of the game I guess lol
---
Most guilds don‚Äôt have people outside the guild in raid with them, so it‚Äôs not a problem. 
---
Once you start bringing in pugs, you kind of have to freeroll most items.  This should be expected until your guild actually has 40 raiders.
---
I like Crossroads.  It feels like a nice small village outside the big city of Orgimmar.  Its a place where you could buy a few acres and set up a ranch.
---
Invisibility is counted differently than stealth so it does nothing for rogues
---
Get T2 helm and then get sad because you dont get MC loot the following night? There's 39 others who need loot too, consider yourself lucky you got a piece.
---
&gt; So if retail with more players than Classic is dead, what does it make Classic? Deader?
---
Not saying Classic has more, but you can't confirm what you just said either. How can you say retail has more players, yet ask people for source on the opposite claim.
---
Right now retail feels absolutely dead, all you see on trade chat/general chat are people selling carries. Trust me, I wish that wasn't the case, I actually don't hate retail and would love to return.
---
No M8 you‚Äôre literally a braindead apes player who thought prot was 1-3 buttons max. At least the idiot above allowed for up to 5 max. If your so good why don‚Äôt you just win a blizzcon tourney or something.
---
I feel this post's title should have had an ACHTUNG! before it.
---
I see you also play on Skeram.
---
it doesn't matter, you will optimize your gear for raid or pvp and in both cases it will be good enough to steamroll 5 mans even if you could probably make a better set for it.
---
You can probably still use the item restore feature to get it back, assuming this was in Classic.
---
If you still have 1/2 pug raids you need to change guild...
---
Zul Farrak and whole Tanaris will always be my favorite place in the game. I still remember farming my first hunter gear there!
---
Nah just read it
---
Windseeker Alliance may be right for you. We sit at medium population almost all the time (pushing into high sometimes during peak hours and weekends, and sometimes low at odd hours of the morning). There are probably a dozen guilds with at least one boss down in MC, and LFG has plenty of activity for max level dungeons. The server is very laid back compared to the high population servers, and even rerolling now you should have ample opportunity to join a guild and see endgame content.
---
I personally would describe the population/activity level as seeming exactly like a high-ish population server back in vanilla. Plenty of people, sometimes overcrowded, but never out of control. There were only a few times during leveling that I had to give up on trying to complete a quest due to too many people being in the area.
---
Nothing stops you from going with a 30/21/0 or 0/21/30 build. This way, you can get that added Shadow or Fire damage PLUS DS's bonus to each.
---
Not everyone can execute on this idea.
---
Picked herb and tailoring, thanks everyone for the advices
---
actually amazing...
---
nice job
---
It looks cool AF.
---
Speed runs generally have more then one run to them as well. So currently his set the speed run but he is saying that it's easily beat able.
---
Bruh how do you walk and control the camera with CRD?
---
if you actually need to farm gold, you will never go do a dungeon solely hoping for a BoE drop... the chances are just too low. you might do dungeons sometimes to help someone, finish a quest or other reasons. that's like saying I'll quit my job and just play lottery to get me through life.
---
Rouge means red in french! The rogue in french WoW is called "voleur" iirc
---
And RFK doesnt take 1-2 hrs, 30 mins tops
---
I stand corrected, seems wierd though, In all the MCs I've done I've never seen fury warrios get close to topping the meters.
---
The limit for debuffs being so low was bullshit... how on Earth did they think it's a good idea with classes specializing on applying multiple DoTs?
---
It's a fine item for a tank purely based on it's DPS. There are better items available, especially in a raid, but having it allows you to not have to take a wep away from a dpser. 
---
But, it's not worth 1k gold by a long shot. I'm a tank and I'd sell it if I got it, personally.
---
I think that's exactly what I'm going to do. Being told to farm 60 Soul Shards to summon randoms across the world to Dire Maul, and then again over to Kargath is bullshit.
---
That's just a rumor. I played in beta early on as a lock and never had this issue.

Happy for that group for not having to deal with you.
---
To be honest, once you break the 40ish mark stuff starts becoming A LOT more valuable all around. Greys vendor for way more, quests start giving close to 1g as the reward. Greens become 1.5g~ if they are worth vendoring. I had about 60ish gold at 39, and was in a panic because I wanted my mount as soon as I hit 40. After some thought i kinda just let it be and tried to not focus on that and continue to level, and i had my mount before level 42.
---
I have a feeling it'd take 1 to 2 with this shaman healing
---
Yea, saw that earlier :) Thank god. This will be awesome.

How much should I charge for lockpicking as a rogue? Any price-list for 125/175/225 boxes?

Slightly off comment but batshit weird thing to leave over.
---
The gun from Golemagg is worse for hunters than a couple blue XBows from 5 mans. They were right to not give it to a hunter.
---
So you did not even bother to ask what he meant, you just left and stranded 3 people not even involved. Go back to retail, sounds like they need a superstar elitist like yourself there. I mean there is no way that tank might have had valuable information.
---
I know that's not how it works for classic and vanilla, and blizz fixed it for later expacs.  It was just an oversight of this game that I wish wasnt in it.  I deal with it though.

---
&gt;So I joined a group to run RFK last night and I left just inside the instance because of something the tank said. Most of the group wasn't there yet, just me (resto shaman), the tank (warrior) and a rogue. We cleared a few trash mobs and I did a bit of attacking rather than straight up healing because, hey why not? Then the tank says "you don't need to refresh lightning shield, I got this".
---
original text
---
Yeah but you can't get it if you go PI.  You do get it if you go DS/Holy
---
Its not a selfish mindset. It's 100% fair to everybody vs the absolute greed and self importance of someone assuming they're entitled to a priority roll on a jackpot boe that happened to drop just because they happen to be able to equip it. This is especially true when it comes to low level twink boes in leveling dungeons where the gold value of selling to a twink who will use the item forever absolutely dwarfs the utility value of equipping the item only to replace it in a few levels. Expecting 4 people to effectively click "pass" on the full value so one person can use a portion of it is not only greedy, but also kinda dumb.
---
If you feel like you really really *need* a particular item, you can easily buy it. And if you've got lucky and won a few good items you were able to sell, you can possibly afford to.
---
Yes,  I understand people want gold but you know...many tanks love that sword...the way it looks...how hard to get....I love that thing.  
---
But you're right,  I am no longer going to pug DM.  I was foing 4-6 runs daily with pugs but that stops today.
---
For me it says "Type /help for a listing of a few commands" as if the addon wasnt there but i see the window
---
Because I am an inexperienced raid logger. Won‚Äôt be making that mistake again

After seeing so many stories of World of Warcraft destroying families by being too addictive, stories like this are always nice to see.
---
If you are drinking and over half mana you bet your ass I‚Äôm pulling the next pack soon. If the DPS are sitting around at half HP thats a problem with tank and dps to begin with.
---
There's no way
---
Sounds like your guild sucks at recruiting. My guild currently has 2 full 40 man raid groups. Also farming soulshards is the life of a raiding warlock but those shards should not be spent summoning lazy people who can't make it on time.
---
Tirisfal Glades. It was my first experience in WoW at 7 or 8 years old. My uncle got me into the game and not only are the Tirisfal vibes just chilling and awesome, but every time I go there I remember my first hours as an undead warrior with my uncle standing over my shoulder teaching me the ropes and answering all my excited questions. My uncle, Samuel, lost his life to cancer in late 2013. He played his orc hunter until his health made it too difficult, and Aurealok the orc hunter stands as he was the day he logged off the last time.
---
I still visit Tirisfal just to feel those memories again. He was the closest thing I had to a dad. We shared amazing memories in Azeroth for nearly my entire childhood, and nothing brings me back quite like that undead starter zone.
---
Aw I‚Äôm sorry you had to experience this before leaving. Did you enchant your blade with anything on the journey to 60? Maybe I‚Äôll go for something cheaper
---
I hope I never run into you. Just solo quest if you don‚Äôt want your group to fucking type lmao. Maybe they should type and only shower you with compliments on how great you are at the game.
---
1. If you need to wait 15 minutes to get a tank, trust me, your server doesn't have a tank shortage. How about 1 hour+ to get a tank who doesn't ask for a payment or reserved items for him?
---
2. I understand you are willing to limit yourself to 5man and maaaaaybe molten core/ony content. That's completely fine, but there are people who want to progress further in their raid content and warrior with their awful, awful, awful AOE threat still does better there than pally. Oh and there are people who play Horde.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a tough decision... I mean the problem is if they allowed unlimited dots the content would be way too easy, and balancing around that would make having a ton of warlocks mandatory which sucks. At least we still have a lot of utility from curses/summoning/SS.
---
Spellstone is great for PvP against any form of magic. Removes mage/druid roots and ignite, immoalte and corruption, druid dots. Not to mention 900 magic dmg absorb.
---
Most BiS lists i have seen have the savage glad chain on there with some other gear options as well. 2 of them are quest rewards.
---
The last room of Uldaman. I remember being a kid amd going there, probably my first dungeon ever. It was one of tbe first times i paid attention to the lore and thought the story the little projection told was the coolest shit ever.
---
It dropped in MC for my guild on Kromcrush.
---
I‚Äôd rather not go into survival, I spent 64g on warmonger +3 to hit 2h sword
---
What is a layer?
---
Yeah that's what people don't understand,  how cool looking it is and it is a great weapon to boot,  people keep saying there is better options...well fuck off with that.
---
Savage Gladiator chain is the best for you.
---
Dude, you've spent 2 days now trying to justify your selfish greed to me,  I think you'd realize I'm not going to let your selfish attitude off the hook. 
---
I guess you're still here because you're trying to justify it to yourself or something?
---
Again,  play the game as greedy as you want,  just make sure your teammates know you'll ninja upgrades from them because for you gold is the most important thing.
---
Most legitimate guilds won't need to take pugs and use loot systems that reward people based on their contributions to the raid and/or guild in general.
---
I wish I could upvote this more! First class I played in beta was lock. I've ran locks through out most of wow, and now in classic too. But, there are many who really appreciate us. 
---
They are a minority it seems...
---
Don't force it.  
---
Quit if you want, mmo's are a huge time input for little to no accomplishment. If community ain't doing enough for you i suggest you find other things to do
---
If your guild truly is "half pug" it needs to merge with a similar one, or it's just going to fall apart. Recruiting 20 more raid-ready people at this stage is tough.
---
He‚Äôs just rounding down his average.
---
Astrall recall for me
---
&gt; to answer your BoP question, lets imagine a theoretical loot distribution system in which all drops are auctioned between group members.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; imagine a edgemasters drops -
---
&gt; all players would likely bid somewhat under the AH sellable value of the item (assuming liquidity)
---
&gt; imagine a hand of justice drops -
---
&gt; warriors and rogues would likely bid hundreds of gold
---
&gt; hunters, significantly less but maybe still above vendor value
---
&gt; rest of classes, vendor value.
---
Good thing loot distribution is not based on auctioning drops. It's based on need before greed, if you don't need the item and someone else does, you needing it to sell makes you greedy. It doesn't matter if the item only sells for 4g to vendor or 100g to auction, you are still taking an item away from someone who is going to use it for your gold gain, pretty much the definition of greed. 
---
&gt;that is the difference between BoP and BoE - a BoE has roughly equivalent value to all players, a BoP does not.
---
But it isn't equally valuable to you and someone who actually needs it. To you it's just x amount of gold you get from auctioning it, to them it's an x amount of gold worth item and x amount of gold that they get to keep from not having to buy it later. So it's essentially twice the worth for someone who actually intends to use it than for someone just auctioning it.
---
You can do it either way, prioritize the spec you want to do more of. Tanking is a little more reliant on a proper spec (the blessings and threat increase is very strong) but as long as you have Consecration you should be fine tanking. You will mostly have to just drink more if you aren't in the "proper" spec.
---
For example, as holy tanking, you might have to keep Consecration rolling the whole fight and judging more liberally to keep aggro off of your group without the increased threat or reckoning for single target threat.
---
You're really not helping your argument that people should pass a 1k gold item to you based on it looking cool...
---
It really depends.
---
Any tradeable item over maybe 20g, everyone should roll need. It's worth the same to everyone, and everyone should get a shot at it.
---
It's fair, prevents ninjas, and the winner can always give it or sell it at a discount if they choose.
---
I've never seen anyone care about someone needing a cheap green or blue that's an upgrade for them
---
Right, you have to have a lot of people to trigger it and I‚Äôm pretty sure it only applies to mobs. Tried farming elemental fire when it swapped to 1 layer and the mobs sure as hell weren‚Äôt spawning quicker despite there‚Äôs being many more people there than normal.
---
Saw a video a couple days ago on this sub that was a hunter doing a tribute solo in 12 minutes. So if they do 4 runs per hour thats probsbly 50-100 gold depending on luck.
---
Yep. Hits at 0:22.
---
its pretty dull but im usually listening to an audiobook or podcast when i do that... and i basically use it like knitting... kinda just something to do with my hands while i listen to something i really want to hear. also it takes no mental bandwith so its a good veg out activity. can't do it for terribly long tho before getting bored like maybe a half hour. also helps to have a tangible goal (like, 'i grind until my bags are full/get x amount of xp/etc')
---
Ornate adamantium if you haven't already picked something else, Or Kromcrushes
---
Herod had a 1 hour queue last night but is still layered.  Not sure how they are going to figure this one out......
---
What EU realms have queue time if you dont mind me asking, i have been looking for the most populated server but when they hit high it feels Like the same as a medium server
---
Idiots, people with absurd amounts of money, and for future twinks. Going by your post, you‚Äôre prolly In the first option...
---
Exactly that...don't tank DM with randoms.
---
Oh my god, screenshot the email, don't crop out like 1/3 of it with a slanted phone pic.
---
Definitely Winterspring, I just love the snowy aesthetic.
---
Even if it were out, hunters dont get to claim equal priority for a *tiny marginally better stat stick* when there are 2 other classes that use the actual damage &amp; speed of the weapon.
---
Still better then waterbreathing for an undead &gt;.&gt;
---
Again. Stop being obtuse.
---
If you look at the results of any gold farming session dataporn the BOEs sold are usually about half of the total income.
---
I actually got a blue Tortoise Armour after a PUG randomly PM‚Äôd me to tank the Ashenvale dung.
---
It was a hectic mess lol. Are there any other warrior quests that give good gear aside from the chest piece?
---
HoJ is super overrated. The proc is less than 2% in reality and the AP is really low.

I prefer 2%hit even with 9% cap because white hits still misses a lot with 9%.

So Im sitting in 14% hit and 23% crit without HoJ. Fuck HOJ BABYYY

The problem I've been seeing is people spreading the idea of,"If its BoE EVERYONE roll need because everyone needs gold".  
---
  I really hate this because while leveling I had two different instances where a major weapon upgrade dropped and both times everyone needed to sell on AH and I lost both rolls.  This was during the time I was trying to get Ravager (SM Arm axe) and literally ran arm 28... yes 28 times and couldn't get it to drop.
---
  As far as I'm concerned, if it's an upgrade for you, even if you aren't high enough level yet, you should roll need.  Cant use it?  Greed.  Greed and need have very simple and easy definitions. It shouldnt be that complicated. Whether is BoE or not should NOT be a factor.
---
Int is still more valuable in PvP for that reason, since you'll go oom slower. Sp can be valuable, but it's mostly inconsequential for PvP gear. PVP is rarely purely 1v1 situations, larger mana pool more important. World PvP you're using ability that benefit little from SP.
---
Sp is valuable in duels, but it's still less valuable than int and stam, since mosy PvP gear contain high int and stam, but little SP.
---
Also in IT.
---
You just answered your own question. Read the community forums, watch a youtube guide, join your class discord, do your homework.
---
I see you're trying to learn prot, but the addon you want will not help you. It won't tell you when you should battle shout a second time just for aggro. It won't tell you when you should switch to berzerker to intercept. You need to read, then practice what you learned.

Congrats you took the worst screenshot in history.

Mulgore, specifically that approach to Bloodhoof down the hill as a fresh level 5 Tauren.  Lots of alts have started with that hike!

No i didnt. Always takes everyone like 15min to get there. Hinterlands is where you should be at when your 48
---
Yup Crater is full of heathens
---
Not even. I'm on Incendius and the higher level zones (Searing Gorge, Burning Steppes, Un'goro Crater Felwood, Winterspring) are PACKED with Alliance at every turn. I've been trying to quest there and rarely see other Horde. 
---
I like pvp, I think I'm pretty good at it, but for the past week I've been double or triple teamed more often than I cared to count, with no Horde around as backup.
---
It isn't false. https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dk6gx5
---
I can also confirm that although you are correct about kiting, you are wrong about this post. These specific mobs do not stop following, i've ran from BRD to Thorium Point with them chasing me the entire time, I even polymorphed and ran and despite everything I still ended up dieing because nobody at the town would help
---
No, nothing you can do. Yeah it's a bit of a shame.
---
I'm aware. But Whipvine Cord is better than Tier 1 (by my calculations).

LOL ofc i make water for free if we are in a dungeon group, but i charge random people asking me for water while im in Orgrimmar

Again,  you're clearly trying to justify your greed to yourself now.

If your teammates getting upgrades isn't important to you,  that's just just you chose to be - least you can do is give them a heads up

Dreadmist/Necropile is pre-raid PvP BiS. If you can get tier 1, get tier 1. It's much better.

This was beautiful.

Wasn't a guild run, same thing happened to me. Huntard rolled against 3 warriors and me (rogue) and won. Said it was "his bis" I wanted to say a lot worse but I called him a huntard and told him about the DM N polearm.

I'm 60 and have done maybe 30 runs or so, tilted me enough to roll a tank alt so I can reserve stuff lol

Im a 56 warrior on Anathema it is a little harder to get groups in that LFG and /2 aren't scrolling by like a twitch chat.....

I personally prefer this server and am excited to have more horde (hopefully) transfer here now that lots of servers have queues again

It was back in 06 and we just duo lvled 1-60 together in 8 days, still going strong

Maybe it's you that is selfish,  it's a tank class book but all you see is money signs.
---
Blizzard is solely responsible for not putting caps on the server numbers when they opened them.  I get they didnt know the exact demand and didnt want to open too many servers, BUT WHY NOT PUT A CAP ON THE NUMBERS???????  TIFU Blizzard edition.
---
And you are part of the people spreading misinformation.
---
So if I'm 50/50, it would probably be easier to be holy prot and heal sometimes than be full holy and tank sometimes (assuming I have appropriate gear)?

believe it or not, a lot of classes get their BIS or preBIS gear from the AH

Enable click to move, then press 2 fingers on the screen to move to that spot.

The camera is tricky, don‚Äôt try to hold down the screen and adjust that way. Instead single click in a spot on the screen, and it will adjust your camera. It takes some getting used to. 
---
I used to only use it for fishing, but I‚Äôve gotten used to it enough to where I‚Äôve managed to kill 2 devilsaurs while using it. One day I travelled from UC to Azshara and did the tide pool vials quest there while Remote Desktop‚Äôd.

Definitely a learning curve to it.

Hey,  I understand the mindset. It's just wrong and undeniably selfish to deny a teammate an upgrade because you think the size of your wallet is more important.

Im horde and anytime i see an alliance being double teamed i just sit and watch to see if they can pull it off lol glad that third alliance did that.
---
Seems there‚Äôs an unspoken pact between all warriors to leave each other alone outside of formal PvP because I have almost never been ganked by one. It‚Äôs always mages and rogues that feel like they need to flex their epeen.
---
You have to remember the Horde had 2 games prior to WC3 where they were just murderers enslaved by the Burning Legion.
---
Yup, we clear pretty much the whole instance (all satyrs, all lashers, all four bosses). You can get to all by one tome spawn as well (you can technically get to the last one as well but you need to clear the whole upper ring, it's possible but takes 20 minutes).

Based on [this](https://retro-wow.com/forum/printthread.php?tid=4288), crit cap for melee is ~33%.
---
A troll once killed me when I was attacked by guard. I did /cry and he waited till I spawned to do /sorry. I mc'd and buffed him. After that we ran around 1k needles for a while and he told everyone to not kill me. A 60 undead still did and corpse camped me after but that's just because undead are fucko's
---
One of the sites with a rundown of the event (I think wowhead) orginally said undead only, but then I got one of the satyr first, and when I went back to check the article again, they had updated it to say any mob that can drop bags.
---
Because you want to reduce an already simple game down to hitting whatever button an addon tells you to and it's lame as fuck.

Wtf is this post

There's a significant difference between dungeon and raid in relation to this question. In a RAID, wolf is your best bet, hands down. This is because you're going to be put in the group with melee classes and your Trueshot aura and wolf howl are going to increase their damage output. Period. If you're raiding, you should be min/maxing and this is the ultimate combination for a hunter.
---
That said, people will tell you to run a cat. This is because they read it somewhere or heard it somewhere, but it is not relevant to RAIDs. It is relevant to PVP because spell casters take pushback when taking melee (or possibly all physical damage, to include hunter autoshots) and so if you have a kitty hitting every second, and they usually need 3 seconds to cast, it will now take more like 4 or 5 seconds. That's big in PvP, but doesn't apply in PvE, so the wolf buff is way better than a fast kitty for RAIDs.
---
5 man dungeons are another different beast. There's no telling what your group may consist of. You could have one melee character (the tank) and then 2 casters so the wolf doesn't add much. It doesn't help you much either because it's way over there and the howl only has a 20 yard range. In this case, pretty much any pet is useful. If you're running with an undergeared tank, or someone who can't tank multiple mobs at once, take a boar or other tanky type pet. (Ex: boar, gorilla, turtle) so that you can off-tank with your pet. If you're running with a well oiled machine of a 5 man group, take your highest dps pet... but it really doesn't matter much in 5 mans.
---
It seems you finally realized that your position is indefensible, so you've resorted to completely ignoring what I am saying. Cool beans, enjoy your life mate
---
Couldn‚Äôt disagree more tbh. If you ‚Äúneed‚Äù a BoE upgrade, go buy it. If you need it and equip it, you‚Äôve effectively needed an amount of gold (selling price of the item), and prioritized yourself getting that amount of gold over everyone else in the group.
---
Same for BoE profession recipes. Just because you have the profession doesn‚Äôt mean you get the potentially 100g item.
---
I think there's people speaking a different language when they argue this. Layers don't literally expand population capability of server. They disperse server load in condensed areas (orgrimmar) that tax servers highly, it's not a 1:1 relationship. Stand in org when thrall does warchiefs blessing on an unlayered server at peak hours, the game almost crashes. 
---
With this said, when you shut off layers, there's going to be more people in orgrimmar ect, so they need to lower server capacity to prevent crashes in condensed areas. 
---
In a way layering indirectly influences total population capability.
---
I'm prioritizing everybody's wallet equally, and I've never felt bad that somebody else won the roll on a boe that i would have equipped.
---
Yup, entirely correct. Tier 1 gives you a pretty good mix of life, mana, mana regg and +healing.
---
This. Find a guild that is building a TEAM. My guild after most of our core group hit 60 are now helping our other players level while we recruit to fill our raid. We are pugging MC and Ony in the mean time.  I have been 60 for over a month. Got most of my preraid BiS in the first week. Still haven‚Äôt got my shoulders sadly rocking paladin shoulders for now. I‚Äôm a Prot warrior 
---
I get my sense of progression when we get another player to 60 or get a guildy Ony attunement. I‚Äôve spent the last week helping my wife and 3 other guildies through their late 40s with ZF and Mara runs. While other members of the team are helping our dudes in their 50s get attunements and helping them hit 60. 
---
Classic is a team game IMO. If you come at it with an US not ME mentality you will have a much better time. Classic is all about building a community for me not building my character.
---
It really takes an ape to play a game continuously for 15 years.

All these posts like this are getting out of hand and just repeat shit, stfu. As a tank, I control the pace, if you can't keep up gtfo my group. Go join a turtle group.

Yeah, this on Mankrik.  He's been running BRD 5-10 times a day for at least 3 weeks now, pretty insistent on getting the mace.
---
Yeah there's a page somewhere where you can restore any deleted/sold item once every 15 days. Some guy does it when farming mara with the unique-equipped blues as you can only have 1 at any given time
---
Quickly and efficiently? Probably 50s.

---
Hinterlands.  Great layout, good farming, good pvp opportunities.
---
Yes, and I conceded that Whipvine was better, literally immediately.
---
By "raid ready" I'm more talking about finding twenty unguilded level 60s who are interested in raiding every week, now that the game's nearly been out for a few months. They don't even need decent gear, it's only MC. The best thing to do in a situation like this is merge two guilds that are both desperate for lots more raiders, otherwise you end up with two guilds trying to snag everyone they can and getting nowhere.
---
Because I'm trying to understand where you're coming from. And I obviously don't. Why would you need to emulate the retail gameplay to be able to play with your friends on Classic?
---
It‚Äôs hard to get value with Troll racial. At full health it gives you 10% for 10 sec which won‚Äôt get you an extra cast. At low health it gives you 30% but uses a gcd, and usually in those circumstances I‚Äôm getting away from what hurt me or moving to a tank, not spamming casts for 10 sec. You can use other stuff to lower your health in safe situations to get the most out of it (skull or demonic runes), but I‚Äôm just not a fan because of trinket cooldowns and runes sharing cd with mana gems.
---
Ok, that makes sense. Also, does this work with cleave? Heroic striking as a fury warrior is a very good way to end up with threat...
---
Claiming that everybody in a group is obligated to just hand you an item that costs more than a mount is what's selfish here, bro.
---
What an incredible story that I'm sure most of us could relate to in some aspect
---
"We haven't heard from Coolio in a while."
---
Arms, 2h tank everything except really hard hitters. Sunder armor over heroic strike even when solo leveling until you get whirlwind.
---
After getting ganked in Burning Steppes all morning, me and some random people ganked every Horde we saw in Tanaris while questing, including a guy 10 feet from finishing the Tooga escort quest by himself...
---
Also later that night I sat in shadowmeld in Sunrock Retreat in Stonetalon sending my pet to kill random lowbies in town for about 45 minutes. I kept my pet right in a spot out of town so that the guards wouldn't chase him when I pulled him back.
---
I really only feel bad about the Tooga quest guy though
---
Saw that orcs comment on the matter and immediately logged out, rerolled, and deleted my lock
---
Two spots in IF actually.  Favorite at the moment is right outside the bank area, always packed with people and fun to hangout in.  My favorite in the past (and likely will be again soon once I ding 60) is right outside the IF gates!  Back in the day it was the spot to be on my server (Illidan) where we would duel, and defend the occasional horde raid.
---
Hey,  If that's how you want to play man,  it's your call.  Just make sure to give your teammates a heads up that the size of your wallet is more important than them getting an upgrade, and give them a chance to find someone better if they want.  You won't be able to justify your greed to me,  but keep trying to justify it to yourself if you want. 
---
Need&gt;Greed
---
They don't need to split it because everyone rolled on it, everybody had an equal and fair shot at it and the game decides who wins. You're advocating only select members of the group have a shot at it which is unfair and a very privileged fucktard attitude. All members contributed, all members are entitled, that's why BOE exists. I'm not going to need on a BOP that I can't use but you can because it doesn't have equal value to us both.
---
Posting about it is a joke too.

Now do this test 1,000 (or 10k) times to help remove the train variable and calculated the averages to get better pointless data. It might be an xp waste though.

your the most braindead monkey ever if you believe that cultivating a skill over a long period of time is not applied to WoW but is to other video games. the bottom line is those dudes ARE the best of the best in wow, top notch 0.1% players and they showed it the first week of classic even being out, and by COMPLETELY DOMINATING the private server scene on every big vanilla server for 5+ years. also streaming takes developing that skill too, you can be the best in the world and have 15 viewers but these guys have HUNDREDS. what proof? the best ranked dota players in the world dont have many viewers sometimes and they play for MILLIONS every tourney

Except weapon attack speed matters much more for hunters than just looking at pure dps since you want to Aimed Shot after an auto ends instead of whenever you want. With a 2.6 speed weapon, before quiver attack speed, you're losing so many autos in general. There's a reason no good hunter will ever get Strikers or Blastershot.

You are in for a wonderful journey while leveling, please keep us updated on your experience for other dungeons you actually run.

You act like 2 months is a long time. There are still tons of players who aren't even 60 yet that would love to get invited to raid guilds for when they reach 60. Sad part is many raidnguilds have little patience so thats why they pug

I must admit I very seldom eat when I tank in dungeons (with my arms warrior). What I have found is that the healers seems to top me off. I only notice that my health is good and not needing to eat. Good for me as I generally don‚Äôt buy food unless I have to. 
---
I would think that most healers feel it‚Äôs part of their role to keep everyone at full health. 
---
I will happily wait for the healer to complete his drinking and I will never show any form of impatience as I find that rude.
---
Sounds like something my EX would do.

EXACTLY. So how can you tell if they aren't going to sell it? And even if they could equip it, at that point there is nothing stopping them from saying fuck you, and selling it anyway. So you keep feeding ninja's, I'll keep telling my groups to ALL NEED when a BoE of value drops. Someone doesn't like it? Tough shit, its literally the only fair way to the whole group. BoE = gold. Gold = less time each class has to farm gold. Nobody's time is more important than others. I don't care if you happen to be on the class its use is intended for at the time. What about the Paladin that rolls need on every tank, dps, and healer item that suits him? Because thats like 80% of drops. Then theres the rogue who can only need on 10%. That is heavily skewed and unfair.

Tell you what, if you can actually explain to me how it is selfish/greedy to give everyone in the group a fair shot at the roll, then I'll give you all the gold on my account

Shadowform isn't actually needed right when you turn 40, since it means you are losing Wand spec by doing so.  For wPvP it is a HUGE improvement on QoL though.

Honestly, if someone can convince someone else to give them good-game-money for terrible-game-money? Good for them. I can't see this happening often at all.

Also, either way, the person's been working for the gold, not just dumping IRL cash. I guess that helps.

To clarify, this wolf is the best wolf because it is the only one that can teach/learn Furious Howl 4 (I think it's 4, whatever the highest rank is.) It also has Bite 8, which is the highest rank in that ability as well. From what I just read, it's the only pet that can teach bite 8, so another reason to pick this wolf up, even if you go with another pet.

Burning Steppes¬†were so beautiful and I remember having it as my wallpaper for a bit. Plus, anything that gets you close to Rag is all that matters, ha.

Blizzard seems to be a bit better at detecting account sharing than they used to, so I probably wouldn‚Äôt in this day and age.  But I definitely did it for folks way back in vanilla, but back then, there were fewer guides, so you just had to do it the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù way.
---
I was thinking this the other day. I loved vanilla and am quiet enjoying classic but I still want the excitement and wonder of a new game. Classic all the mystery is gone, everyone knows the most optimal gearing strategy, best talents and builds, all the boss fights, where to farm BIS gear, etc. So if you want to run a dungeon for fun or a one time quest it's far harder to do so in classic than it was in vanilla. Eg I wanted to rune DME on my priest to get the key and get rid of a few quests. It's been impossible to find people for it since the gear is mostly junk from that side. Only people that go in east are looking to farm gold.
---
And I lol'ed so loud I woke the dogs.

No one asks them to stop what ever important thing they are doing lol. If they are so busy they can still say no when getting whispered. 
---
If they HELP YOU, then yes, HELP is a selfless act, if asking for a tip for helping someone your are actually asking for a payment. And then it‚Äôs not help anymore but a service. People who help other people do it for the sake of helping other people. I‚Äôm pretty sure you know that from the real world, which maybe some of the wow community seem to have lost touch with. Tips are accepted but not mandatory. 
---
But the fuck I will do paying a Magetard for clicking on their spell button two times.

I just traded a WoW token with my retail gold for 200g in classic

I scooped one farming zombies in WPL. High density mobs to get as many as you can quickly, also highly contested by both factions so there are upsides and downside.

PvP can and should also be seen as end game, not just pve raiding

And again at your own risk so if you trade someone gold and then they ditch ya it's your own fault and Blizzard will not be restoring gold or items this way.  This has been reposted more then once.
---
I did my own research and couldn‚Äôt find any alternatives other than Weak Auras for which there are no good profiles so I came to Reddit. Many engineers will go to quora for the same problems. Doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre lazy or cheating their employers. I realize it won‚Äôt tell me to intercept, that‚Äôs too situational. I want something to help me keep up with my binds to reduce the learning curve, and something in the background I can use when focusing on other mechanics for maxing. 
---
Why does the top parsers for the best guilds in retail use similar addons?
---
Mages can farm DM for gold at level 40 for their mount.
---
Yeah I just do it for free and if people tip, that's great.
---
I'm hoping they have a character copy function, where you can copy your wow classic character over to a specific BC server but you still have access to each.
---
I just prefer a slower rollout. Blizzard will do as they wish.
---
hunter wep
---
I believe so.
---
This is the truth. One item reserve usually only blocks out 1, maybe two classes. And let‚Äôs be real, reserves usually effect dps more than healers/tanks. Finding different dps isn‚Äôt hard to do either and the ‚Äúreserve‚Äù won‚Äôt bother them in any way
---
I will openly admit to having a crush on Paul Rudd.
---
I struggle to believe that its not an upgrade for most tanks out there. It's the best sword for tanking except for Brutality Blade, and there you're going up against all the rogues and dps warriors for it.
---
Just keep using Thrash Blade. It isn't worth spending 300g on a marginally better sword.
---
It would have to be one of the goblin towns. I love the tension and lawlessness feeling they have. Probably Booty Bay for the flavor.
---
Murlocs...oh no...

Earlier this week in a Dire Maul we had a lockbox drop. The rougue in our group opened it up for the winner and he looted it there. contained two of the same pattern. Haven't seen two of the exact same item in a lock box before.
---
As a warrior weapon upgrades are huge.
---
I'd be mad too.
---
Correlation vs causation. Might wanna read into that before being anecdotal
---
Yeah, the way AoR did classes was cool. Race specific classes but aesthetically different and perfectly symmetrical balance.
---
If all you have left is literally repeating yourself while trying to call me mad for disagreeing with you then I think we're done here.
---
This has been 100% the case in every dungeon since the beginning of WoW, and still continues to be. Even when the skip itself takes longer than clearing the pack of trash would have taken. Bonus points if its M+.
---
Anyone have a non-broken version of itemrack/trinket menu they are using? I downloaded itemrack off twitch and have been using the trinket menu on it but it doesn't recognize all the trinkets in my inventory.
---
Goldshire. For reasons
---
Thanks for the insightful comment, and the gatekeeping.
---
Im the guy that made the Stratholme guide Pilav was bagging on.
---
I will openly admit to having a man crush on Paul Rudd.
---
Here is what you do, you start your own group, reserve the item, and do the dungeon with masterlooter with epic set as loot threshold.
---
Meanwhile the person selling the item is having a blast watching the price go up and up
---
So cute and fluffy!!!
---
Sup, Thex, how you been?
---
In other words, they're rushing phase 2, even though they said the servers are clearly not ready for it. And why aren't they ready? Oh, because Blizzard tried to save a few bucks back when Classic launched. Bravo!
---
Examples from our guild are stuff like living essence/essence of undead. Which are then used to give to healers for hide of wild or warlocks for felcloth stuff. 
---
We‚Äôve also been giving the books that drop to guildies who don‚Äôt have the trinket yet.
---
Gehennas prolly
---
Just saved the gloves I had enchanted to do skinning on. This was a very helpful tip.
---
I've never seen anyone banned for ninjaing. Does that happen?
---
I don't plan on assaulting Stormwind as a one man army with MC, I just want to know if the game awards honor for a kill caused during MC/because of MC.
---
I am a mage pulling those numbers I quoted. I have a hunter and warlock guildy pulling the numbers I quoted for Mara and tribute runs.  So I now for sure that those are accurate. I am less sure but still pretty certain about priests and duo jump runs, as I have seen those performed but can account for their consistency. I am least certain about warlock jump runs, as I haven't personally seen it done, just hear about it.
---
You can‚Äôt really do that as a mage. I would respec to arcane/frost 31/0/20 for raids and dungeons
---
There's only one that is better for tanking that I know of, Brutality Blade. Other options like Vis'kaang may offer slightly higher threat, but with both these options you are hurting your dps warriors and rogues. Quel'Serrar doesn't age well once future raids come out, true, but currently it is a fantastic sword.
---
Literally says the guy who is playing WoW and will likely be replaced by technology. Why do we even need a schedule? Something that tells you how to live your life? Or do schedules change and it‚Äôs simply there to add a bit of structure? Why do you care so much? Imagine wasting your life worrying about what addons I use and how I play the game.
---
I agree. Doing this has netted me almost 2k gold. Unloading all my Gold from retail is making gear and buy my epic easier.
---
Its ridiculous but if it's not against the ToS I'm going to do it.
---
I find it incredibly funny, you spend 3/4 your days commenting on NFL posts on reddit so you must not have any craft or skills yourself, you watch grown men throw a leather ball around and yet insult people using technology and the internet to also enjoy their time, while entertaining others...hmmm now it all makes sense, you work minimum wage, obsess over football, get jealous of gamers and streamers and then insult their livelihood. hows burger king? i gaurantee i could duel you 100 times and win 100-0 without losing a single one, and every single apes member could 1000-0 you. "skill less only time invested" my ass
---
Yeah, good guilds. Not being able to clear the content, the guilds doing &lt;40 min MC. It‚Äôs expected that you respec for raid weekly, not come in pvp spec asking to get carried.
---
I haven't had a que on fairbanks I  quite a while, and for that I am grateful.
---
Yeah, it's just a shame Earthfury is such a bad server for raiding. Literally not a single good guild on Earthfury Alliance vs Skeram's stacked lineup
---
WoW's networking scales well. They used aggregated quake-style delta compressed updates for replicated unit data. Their movement, aside from the heartbeat movement packet, is generally very efficient.
---
Where it breaks down is in game design, clientside rendering as the Legion client seems to do poorly with large masses of people than the 1.12.1 client and serverside simulation which unfortunately is a hard N^2 problem to solve.
---
Oh hahahah thats gotta be rough. What do you think about his comment ?
---
Gadgetzan, just like it
---
If you are doing loot council and reserve rolls on blue loot from end game dungeons, you are doing it wrong.
---
These are not rare drops, despite the shitty luck of OP.
---
These are also very good for hunters, despite your misguided view of what stat stick does.  Any hunter worth their raid slot will have dps weapons and weapons to use in melee.  These are not always the same weapon.
---
There are so many dumb typos in quest text and dialogue in classic (and I‚Äôve seen some in retail too). It‚Äôs a lot of text to edit, I get it. But there are some egregious errors, lol
---
Can you list specific items? I'm a new player
---
That grenade in the beginning was pro! Nice work!
---
It honestly makes me do more dungeon runs, since they‚Äôre more time efficient
---
How *does* daze work?
---
He's pretty well known for being a UFC commentator too. And slightly known for his stand up comedy
---
Had two blue drops while soloing. One was Mug'o Hurt, not very useful. And the other one was Wand of Alistar or however it's named.
---
as a human, you can deathwarp and that would save you 10-20seconds easily.
---
It certainly did last night on Sulfuras.
---
This was my favorite Hot Ones ever. I love him.
---
Sounds like every run I've ever done with a pug. We could be running a dungeon to gear up our clothies, pug 1 rogue dps, literally nothing but leather drops the entire run.
---
The real question is how the fuck he managed to die to the tabard trash
---
Mother of god
---
Hmm, well the spec I have now is the one I will be using at 60 (deepprot), so the question is whether I want to spend an additional 10g now to go back to another spec and then 15g later for the same spec when I'm about lvl58 for LBRS.
---
Man you must be unlucky. I‚Äôve only had 1 run with no orb. Usually 1-3 orbs a run, with the average being closer to like 1.8 a run.
---
Mulgore is the best because it's beautiful but also because it feels happy. There are many pretty areas in the world to visit but the strife is palpable, whereas Mulgore feels insulated somehow, almost like a vacation destination. Coupled with awesome Thunder Bluff, all other zones fall flat.
---
Didn't say it wasn't.  There has been numerous past posts about GMs saying you can do it but they will not restore anything if say someone were to ninja it.
---
What on earth has what I said got to do with correlation/causation? And where was my anecdote..?
---
Darkshire. It's dark, everything is so dangerous and mysterious I love leveling there.
---
What about Brutality Blade? Take race out of this, obviously an orc would want Deathbringer. Brutality Blade has stats and that 1% crit, which probably gives more threat than the procs and slightly higher dps of Deathbringer and Vis'kaang.
---
How was it?
---
It's invariably hilarious the first time anyone heres about his podcast. "...The Fear Factor guy? H'es still around? He had a podcast with Elon musk?..."
---
Wow, this is broken. 
---
As Horde, you guys get the second best fishing pole in the game from and easy Horde-only quest, but to add insult to injury, the third best fishing pole in the game (and second best obtainable by Alliance) is located in fishing traps by a Horde town which contain shellfish which are USELESS to Alliance but are basically like pocketing 10 silver per shellfish for the Horde? Dafuq? I had to destroy 180+ shellfish, endure countless gankings and drownings and still not get the damn pole while Horde can use this place to easily farm money?
---
What I do before running any dungeon for the first time is look up guides on it and collect every quest and chain of quests that takes you in there. This way you gain xp from the run, the chains before the run, and the quests themselves. 
---
Higher end dungeons typically require multiple runs to get all the quests done, especially BRD.
---
OP confirmed spicy memer
---
1. Tank? Absolutely best option. AoE damage (threat) which warriors struggle with. Rage generation from damage dealt to your self, which is more threat. And the shield which is more aoe threat. Engineering literally resolves the issues warriors have in tanking. Less valuable to Druids. Shield plus paladins is just hilarious 10/10 recommend in particular go and duel rogues you are invincible vs them and they kill them selves.
---
2. Are you a hunter or a rogue? 100% best option. Jumper cables are clutch period.  Also you aoes sucks, so more aoe doesn't hurt.
---
3. Are you anyone else...eh honestly at this point there is probably enough engineers in a raid I wouldn't worry about it unless you pvp. Between pvpers, tanks, rogues, and hunters, odds are you have plenty of engineers to cover anything you ever need. Guilds still need blacksmiths, tailors, leatherworkers, enchanter, alchemists. And quite frankly for healers you need SOME way to make money if you don't want to level an alt.
---
In other words I wouldn't worry about it. You don't need to min/max the game to that extent.
---
im reeeally fucking glad they made the right decision and did include them tho.
---
wouldve loved shadowhunters and wardens aswlel however
---
Jesus, I'm done here. Gl.
---
If you‚Äôre trying AoE grinding, put points into imp frost bolt and CoC until you get Ice Barrier at 40. Then hop straight into arcane and go to Clearcasting ASAP
---
Getting Tarnished Elven Ring, or even two, is really really easy.
---
Any of the tribute loot can be looted by anyone. That means if a guildie does tribute and the ring drops, then anyone can come in and grab it(which is how I got my second yesterday). If you don't have an awesome guildie to get you one for free I've seen people selling them in trade chat for 40-50g.
---
Well in dungeons, obviously they should be fine with sitting around waiting on you. Giving away buffs in a city is stupid because very few people are needing buffs in a city. 
---
However, if you're running around the open world questing and run in to someone else... you should throw them a buff. Guess I should have more specific to cut out the exceptions I thought would have been obvious.
---
I can say from experience that Druid buffs do generate enough threat to pull aggro from a tank that's pulling with a bow. But the threat gen should be extremely low.
---
If alliance didnt have locks they wouldnt have curse of shadows elements or recklessness.  Mages are far more expendable.
---
The way you phrase this story, it sounds like there should be some poignant truth into the relationship between you and your dad. It really does read like that, it would be cool if you added more to show some meaning between you and your dad and conclude that aspect of the story, as you use several overlapping mini-storylines.
---
Dope.
---
I think it's because at the point you're getting close to 60 and just want to get it over, you can do hoodrat things with your friends later.
---
Un'goro Crater  
---
Just amazing all around.

I don't like you I'm gonna block you.  Bye
---
He's so real. :)
---
Make a post in their discord.
---
Sulfuras is the God-Tier server name. So happy to play on it.
---
Definitely look up guides for each 50+ dungeon. They‚Äôll list out all quests that you can get and the chains that you need to complete to get to some of them.
---
For me, it was oddly badlands.  I just recall being out there when the game originally came out running  around with my shaman in wolf form while fighting my way to 40.  I was farming earth elementals, but in general just loved running around that place.  I'm alliance this time around, so I haven't gone because of the lack of quests.  But I always thought it was really cool with all it's nooks and crannies.
---
I would assume you have to be attuned in order to do this?
---
Nah theres no wasting a Nightfall proc other than letting the timer run out without casting a shadowbolt. Theres a mod, Necrosis that does alot of handy things for locks, like soul shard count and deletion, notifications on procs, dot timers etc. All of which are customizable. 
---
The only thing you might need to pay attention to is if you're just chaining shadowbolt, and you get a proc at just the right/wrong time, and double crit. Very easy to pull threat when you accidentally 2k something.
---
BRD has some of these pulls too.
---
"i don't have a point so i'll just deflect and bounce"
---
Alright
---
Layering was forced on us. Then suddenly removed without warning, causing massive queues out of nowhere. Clearly they're trying to rush to phase 2. I think we have a right to complain.
---
Stratholme because it reminds me of the TFT campaign and the amazing WC lore.

I keep running into him!

I'm on Stonespine-EU mate. Others places exist in the world but please, stay in the US.
---
No need for name calling,  my dude,  you be as selfish as you want,  just make sure your teammates know you don't care about their upgrades. 
---
Honestly it seems like gold is the most important thing to you,  clearly much more important than being a good teammate.  Retail seems like it'd be much more your speed.
---
My buddy started playing with my group of friends, but he got all elite and left our guild to start his own, wouldn‚Äôt even invite us lol 
---
So a couple months down the line, he has a pretty established guild, always bragging to us about how much better he is even though he started later than us. 
---
Me and my buddy made an alt on my account and acted like a GM whispering him, you know the whole: ‚Äúrides up on a shadowy horse, hey Gamin, do you have a moment to talk?‚Äù...
---
We ended up convincing him that someone in his guild had complained about language and that we needed to install a language filter in his guild chat...but he had to make me guild leader... because it‚Äôs against policy to take control of a guild or something...idk it was a real stretch, but he bought it, and made me leader. 
---
I immediately kicked him and then the chaos began. ‚ÄúOur fearless leader! Come back to us chosen one!‚Äù....it was kind of culty....
---
Kicked everyone and took everything from the guild bank while giggling with my 13 year old friends. To say the least, he acted like he just got back from Vietnam the next day at school...didn‚Äôt find out until probably 6 months later. Obviously reported me and got a 3 day ban...but so worth it...ahh good times

OG Death knights were dead Warlocks whose souls were bound to the bodies of fallen knights. Modern deathknights were reanimated by the same power as Scourge, which comes from the Burning Legion. Warlocks derive their power from fel and shadow magic, as do Demon hunters.
---
Had a warlock need on an agility cloak against me as a feral druid. His explanation: I need the armor bro.
---
Well it‚Äôs not like ‚Äúevery 5 man run has to send your essences in‚Äù. But more like ‚Äúoh an essence dropped, needing that for xxxx‚Äôs cloak‚Äù
---
It felt like him and Sean became close friends by the end. I hope they meet for beers randomly. Sean is such an amazing interviewer.

Anyone else having latency issues lately? Before I was around 60ms now for the past week it's been around 170ms. I've released my IP already and nothing. Still shitty lat.

MC is considered an offensive action, if you throw him off a cliff I believe you get honor credit (if you were near enough to get credit).

As it's an offensive action, yes it'll trigger guards.

If you want in shadow form, just cast it or use a healing add on.

Had some fella whisper me he needed his box picked. Told him sure, so he opens trade and proceeds to fill the trade with all his boxes... and a single silver. 
---
I whisper him saying "no, you put one at a time in the will not be traded slot. This way is how you get all your boxes stolen." 
---
I was a bit perturbed buddy expected 6 or so 225 boxes picked for a silver as it was, and then he got demanding. 
---
"No, you take all my boxes, unlock them, then give them back. Not one by one."
---
For a moment, I thought about yoinking his ass, but I put him on ignore, to which he sat there and rude gestured at me while I ate a couple tacos. 
---
Moral of the story:
---
You're stopping us in the middle of our own buisiness, and want a service. Don't be a buttmunch about it.
---
When I've read the title of the post a thought it's going to be this https://youtu.be/leL_bsHEZdM?t=61 :D
---
We don't need more of these posts.
---
Me thinks you picked the wrong class.
---
From the way this is written, I suggest: hunter. 
---
Rogues may be asked to pick chests that everyone rolls on.
---
Warriors: tank.
---
Priests: fort, heal.
---
Locks: SS, HS, Summon.
---
 Shaman: Specific totems.
---
Paladin: Specific buffs.
---
Or IDK, come to terms with the fact that you are a vending machine with the best damage and AOE capability in the game?
---
Nothing was reserved, they can see the general chat recruitment message.
---
They can see the previous runs, in which nothing was reserved, it was on group loot, and none of this occurred. 
---
Nothing was said out of game, nothing was said on discord.
---
Love that show!
---
Dudes an ass.. he would probably be offended you think he needs to ask permission.
---
It's not ninjaing to roll need on a boe, and you're the one who has to convince people to pass up on big money drops. I always offer everyone a fair roll even for items i really want for myself.
---
You stand over there on your high horse screaming about semantics and "designer intent" (nevermind that this was long ago proven to be a mistake, that needing was later changed to auto-soulbind an item, or that blizzard has never as will never take action against someone clicking need on a boe then selling it). I'll be here in the real world using the game mechanics the way real humans do based on how they actually work.
---
Nice meme
---
For solo questing viability? I was doing this for awhile, trying to be holy/ret while questing
---
Definitely the Isle of Dread for me. I ended up there on my first troll hunter back in Vanilla while just randomly exploring, and now I make time to stop by every time a level a character through Feralas.
---
The 6 piece set is very competitive. Currently using it in addition to the Aged Core Leather Gloves and Devilsaur legs. I also have Perdition blade and Core hound tooth. Depending on the proc (which tends to stack happening several times in a short span of time and not happen then for a while) I can easily top damage meters amongst rogues and top 5 in raids, with most of my damage coming from backstabbing. My plan is to allow the other rogues in my guild to get geared and wait for a months before start rolling on gear again as I will only drop the set once I have 4-5 T1-T2 pieces. Not fair to roll to just let the gear in the bank!
---
This is why DKP exists.  It certainly has it's own problems, but it removes the hope/despair cycle of lost rolls and balances out where the loot goes.
---
Alright, so what is better than Ravager at level 37 for a warrior doing dungeons? Please, inform me.
---
He dumb. Move on and dw
---
Yeah I spammed Rocco and and arena on the weekend with 52-54s and it was fine.
---
well i certainly agree with your last sentence, it does vary greatly in practice. 
---
But i do have an ad absurdium argument for the "they could sell that for upgrades for themselves". Which is everything thats not a quest item has a vendor price, and you are more likely to see 200g worth of dungeon bop's than 1 "200g" boe so why don't we all just need on everything and then sell what we don't wear for the maximum we can get it cause we need that money to buy upgrades?
---
New rolling rule! Need on everything vendor for epic mount money!

When you're under level 40 it's pretty decent tbh
---
Either the debuff priority list is bugged, or multiple low priority debuffs in the same server tick can knock off a higher prio debuff. When a mob is at 16 debuffs and a new one is applied, it will knock off another debuff to apply itself, even if this new debuff is lower priority than the old one.
---
I had a raid where several people proccing deep wounds at once and someone proccing deadly poison then knocked off curse of recklessness and fairy fire instead of knocking off the two allocated corruptions which should also be lower priority than COR and fairy fire...
---
If debuff priority wasn't apparently bugged, I would be the idiot here.
---
That has nothing to do with the context of this conversation. Lol
---
Its not. If the leader changed the loot options after the group was made and without putting it up for discussion then yeah, that's bannable.
---
Clicking need on a roll however, is not.
---
You wait for them to loot, but you just prepare to skin faster. Having a better ping/faster reaction time, generally.
---
Imp frost bolt dont do a lot when aoe grinding, but sure is nice if you take a break and do some dungeons or quests.
---
My favorite place is Un'Goro crater because I love farming Devilsaur leather with friends that keep me protected from other players ;)
---
If it was not discussed prior, OP can only blame himself.  
---
The community is too focused on minor stat increases pre raid.   Your guild will not struggle to clear MC because a rogue lost the roll on his blue BiS.  Get your head out of your ass.  A raid with rogues in full greens will clear MC.
---
Pre-raid BiS is not an ironclad list.  It is not required to raid.  Stop being petty over a sword from UBRS, ffs.
---
You're breaking rule #3
---
I have ran it a couple of times now and still haven't seen it drop. I don't want to have to contend with 3 other melee classes on rolls if it happens to. 
---
I also don't want to waste the 15G if I don't have to either...
---
Damn you RNGesus.
---
its about +18% but at that point it is essentially averaged out with +crit% so really it becomes a game of maximizing the total dps increase per gear set available to you. This becomes much more complicated come phase 3 due to bwl set gear. For that you need to start using a DPS calculation spreadsheet.
---
Stranglethorn Vale!
---
GboK is 60 threat per target hit, modified by impRF to 114 per target, spammable at 1x per second... Thats the theory anyhow. The videos seem to confirm it but they are both from the same source.
---
If true though and you were in a raid with say 8 of a particular class you would be able to generate 912 tps before holy shield. The video (again from only one source) shows the paladin picking up onyxia easily after she lands using this method.
---
I really want this to be a thing so I am looking hard for confirmation. I have a couple hours before I get home and try it out myself.
---
Thinking of rolling a resto shaman alt but I have two main concerns...
---
1) mana problems - seems like shammies are constantly going OOM and having to break for water
---
2) Windfury - seems to be a really toxic culture around it where it becomes even more important than your heals. i see "LF WF totem" all the time in LFG and it just seems kinda depressing, no other class gets reduced to one ability like that
---
From current shamans, are these legit problems for you or have I overstated them?
---
Moonglade, that place is so peaceful for hanging out, plus even though I went hunter for classic, druids will always have my heart as that was my main class from vanilla till I quit in wod.
---
I'd say that wow's warlock is more than likely based off EQ's necromancer. Pet class, life drain, nasty dots, shadow armour, poor reputation with the rest of their faction, ect.
---
it is bis for that level
---
He put it on Master Looter, immediately jumped and pulled the boss. None of us noticed because we were busy fighting the boss.
---
You're a rare instance. I dont think many classic players actually play retail also.
---
Eh, the Darn mailbox/AH/profession trainer triangle is not extremely efficient. Yes, very few buildings block anything, but you generally want to run around the water, which reduces your speed.   
---
And the fishing trainer is past the teleport out at the village, which is particularly bad. In stormwind, it's right there. Far more cooking recipies and such to be had at Stormwind as well.
---
That‚Äôs what I did when I had a mage alt back in the day. If I had the time and someone would ask me, there you go free water. If I didn‚Äôt have time and someone asked me a simple ‚Äúsorry, no time‚Äù was enough.
---
Hell, Thunder Bluff and Darnassus don't even have warlock trainers. You can say it's because Tauren can't be warlocks, but they can't be priests or mages either and yet they have trainers for those. Warlocks are just kinda hated all around.
---
Lots of people complaining about queues since they removed layers, so i think capacity is down a bit aswell.
---
Doesn't sound like it's something to binge if it lasts dinner
---
Old Azshara, no goblins, no terraforming,  just mysterious autumnal beauty at the edge of the world.  I accidentally wandered over there from Ashenvale many years ago and was struck by its tranquility.  Tried to explore it further but got squashed by ?? mobs and had to leave but I never forgot how much I loved the zone, nor forgave Blizzard for what they did to it in Cataclysm.
---
So we're a month in now... how is it going? I want to hear a follow up!
---
Molten Core. As the first 40 man raid it is where you really get to know your fellow Raiders.
---
Responded to the wrong comment turns out. Thought I was responding to the BiS comments.
---
Wow! that has to be the worst explanation. He's worse than the Ninja because he posted it to Reddit lol.. Impeccable logic kiddo! Do us all a favor and keep your explanation's to yourself.
---
Also similar to the everquest warlock regarding dots. Ive been playing through eq and eq 2 and most wow classes seem to be simplified mashups of eq classes.
---
Yeah no one does this ... QQ
---
Just had one with Edward Snowden
---
I seriously dont understand why is such a taboo to Need some BOE rare or above item that you actually need. I¬¥ve been in far too many groups that if you Need a BOE rare or epic then the entire party also picks need and I¬¥ve missed my fair share of solid upgrades due to this to people that went straight to the AH to sell it.
---
If something really good drops that shouldnt be an excuse for everyone to go nuts, and at least allow the people that could use the item to word if they really need the item or just want the sale profit and decide on that factor, instead of everyone jumping into a blind greedy roll. If you really need to make a profit at least allow the person that really needs the item to buy your roll spot. Just please dont assume that if a good rare or epic BOE drops thats an excuse to act on pure greed
---
past +8 the weapon skill is practically useless compared to any other stat
---
There is an option to get that bar and the top off. It‚Äôs in General. I can‚Äôt remember the check mark box name tho. Sorry
---
This is where you are entitled, you believe others should help others just because. As much as that sounds great, the reality isn‚Äôt there. The moment you whisper a mage for water, you are asking for a service and should pay. If the mage on the other hand says no worries he doesn‚Äôt mind helping that‚Äôs cool. But you going to them and expecting them to help you? go fuck yourself
---
Un'goro Crater, beautiful scenery, excellent wildlife, and large gold pinatas spawning every 12 minutes!
---
Ya, I don't understand anyone who would recommend fiery right now... Always viewed that as like a PvP twink enchant. UBRS and the first two raids are terrible for any fire damage. Just about any melee is going to prefer crusader if cost isn't a concern and if your doing AQ and can't afford a weapon enchant, that's just weird.
---
Cool story, no need to plead the case with me I'm not a gm. I just responded to the guy who said noone gets banned for this action. But the picture here gives us no information except people claiming ninja. I couldn't care less either way, it's a ravager it'll drop again in a few runs. Drive on
---
I can also confirm this definitely works like that today. I love having it proc mid cast but usually the mobs are low or basically dead haha
---
Fair enough, missed that part. Sorry bud.
---
Aren‚Äôt death knights the necromancers in this game? I‚Äôd be strange to have two necromancer classes in the game, which is why I feel it‚Äôs fake.

lol you should beat mages 99% of time
---
That is not a joke, nor am I encouraging any of the sort.
---
It always used to be Duskwood but now it‚Äôs Searing Gorge. Going in I thought I didn‚Äôt like it but now having done every available quest I just love it. I‚Äôve got the thorium brotherhood rep to prove it.
---
imagine thinking its a good thing lmao chill out guy
---
I do this sometimes if I have a decent group. It works well. The healer's mana bar is my timer, when it gets low, I stop and let everyone drink. But,... I've found it *only works with a decent group*, and if it's a decent group, they can already do what needs to be done (hit the targets in order, cc as needed, etc)
---
Stv so many awesome memories of being ganked constantly while questing!
---
Considering the GCD, it‚Äôs really only better than FoL on the move, otherwise you‚Äôre going to have to wait to cast again anyways.
---
That is a terrible argument. BoP items are completely different. They CANNOT be sold, and in turn the gold used to buy another equal item. BoE can. If you need a BoP over someone who can actually use just to sell it for gold... you are wasting that item. That is not at all the case with BoE. 
---
 Very simple example: Edgemasters can be sold and bought for 300g. Freezing band can be sold and bought for 300g. If I am playing a warrior and desperately need Edgemasters but am broke... Why can I not roll need against a mage on the freezing band that I can moments later, go exchange for the one I need just as much as the mage needs freezing band. Its the same thing. Just give me one actual reason why it isn't. The end result is literally the same in that scenario. If I happen to win the roll as a warrior on freezing band, I take one small step of turning the item into gold, and the even smaller step of turning that gold into edgemasters. Thats not selfishness or greed. The mage doesn't deserve and upgrade anymore than I do if we both worked for it. 
---
How about you give me one logical response other than "your greedy"... you can't. You have no real argument. Go ahead, respond to the above scenario and tell me why that isn't fair. Also what are you thoughts on the paladin that can need 80% of gear for his heal/dps/tank specs? How is that fair to the rogue that can need 10% of BoE.
---
I can literally advertise this in trade trade and make bank.
---
I don't think OP is the actual creator of this. But it's sick nonetheless.
---
I always pull the first pack after the bridge and behemoth way back so we don't aggro the elemental pat that goes from it down to princess.
---
But I also clear the patting behemoth and elemental pack that runs to landslide first, and make sure heals and ranged are on the bridge.
---
Deep feral first.  100%
---
Your literally just saying here that you getting gold at someone else's expense is more important than that player upgrading.  This is called entitlement and your a greedy idiot.
---
well i'm gone
---
Warriors get ganked enough by mobs &amp; going into caves
---
Warlocks have no despell.
---
Healers and Mage‚Äôs .
---
You do indeed. I was making a list of pieces of gear with hit.
---
You jump I jump, Jack.
---
Ask for screenshots of opposing cities at identical times.
---
You did indeed have a bad tank, there's no excuse for his actions but ulda can be 4 wipes even with good tanks, and just sloppy placement of dps and heals... Those golem dudes... They are brutal. Almost half my guild hates that dungeon.
---
You don't need on everything because BoE items the value is the same for everyone BoP items the value is the vendor price (which is a couple gold) for people who can't equip it, and much higher for the person who can equip it. That's why people need before greed on BoP items, and everyone gets a chance at BoE.
---
For some reason I have to post this 10x per day. Not one person has ever replied to me when I post this explanation. It has every single time ended the argument. It's basic economics.
---
It is something most people including me dont really approve of in general. If you go out of your way to do it sure, but if im in strat for items, it seems ridiculous to charge people for it. Maybe parties should just make a gold pool at the start for repairs &amp; healer drinks if thats the direction we are going.
---
That‚Äôs kinda the point, not much you can really put in frost that‚Äôs super beneficial for AoE right now
---
Yup, I always have it somewhere in southern Kalimdor. Currently I'm Feathermoon Stronghold bc I've been farming DM, but I've previously had Gadget, Theramore, and even Cenarion Hold when I was farming eles. Def makes the world feel a whole lot smaller from a travel standpoint.

You're not allowed to post people's names if it's in a negative light.  Read the rules  don't argue

Oh, nice! I'm Aava!
---
Yeh, that is a good point about the flask but honestly I would rather use that money to enchant the Benediction :D
---
If you follow this guide then you don't need to flask.
---
I also admit to being gay
---
it's only 10 man UBRS, maybe some people in your guild have pugged MC by this point
---
It might have been nice for the hunter to let you have the item, but the hunter probably didn't know how badly you wanted the item, and it was nonetheless an upgrade for the hunter.
---
All the population census addons have been broken, so it's all guess work at this time
---
Imagine if every raid boss was like this, like how Everquest was. (Still is on p99)
---
Eh, I somewhat prefer the current design they got. Maybe more so in the new models (I'm gonna be crucified aren't I?) because some of the faces actually look a bit sterner and varied instead of the same blank stare.
---
It's not as bad as, say, the draenei or worgen. Worgen especially... the recent update made them much closer together but before the update? Y I K E S
---
It's actually the other way around
---
Paladins are what makes the alliance superior to horde in all group content. They have, bar none, the best buff in the game for dps in raids (salvation). They bring phenominal utility, and are fantastic healers. 
---
They are extremely powerful in PvP - if a paladin doesn't want to fight you, you can't hurt him. If he does want to fight you, it's going to be almost impossible to kill him. They can also do some ok burst damage. What really makes them shine though, is the fact that they're tanky healers and buffers. They bring so much to a PvP group. Blessing of freedom alone makes them worth bringing to a group. They eat other melee classes for lunch. 
---
In five man dungeons, they also make great tanks. The trash is hardest part of dungeons, and paladins are the best trash tanks in the grab - max rank consecration for snap aggro, then downranked versions to maintain it. They have plenty of thorns like effects to help build threat as well. Not having a taunt isn't such a big deal when every party member is dealing 30% threat than usual. They have trouble tanking raid bosses, but that's a non issue in dungeons. Their main downside is the fact they need to use Mana instead of rage for tanking, but there are ways to mitigate this downside.
---
When it comes to healing they're the most efficient healers in the game. Your raid will wipe long, long before your paladins run out of Mana. Seal of light is also an amazing way to keep the melee users in the group topped off, or seal of wisdom to let the casters wand their mana back. Paladins just add so much staying power to a group that you'd be crazy not to bring them.
---
Paladins might not be able to tank in raids, and might have subpar dps, but that doesn't mean they're bad. Theyre still fantastic at solo - the combination of plate armor and healing means that you have almost no downtime, and they can easily kill multiple mobs at once. 
---
I'd argue its shamans that got the short end of the stick. Their ranged dps is bad, their melee dps is bad, and they're the most inefficient healers in the game. They're squisher than paladins to boot. Windfury is very nice though. Shamans might be good at solo PvP, but aren't nearly as good in a group as a paladin.
---
I'm glad to be part of a guild that is using a rotating loot council taking into account guild participation outside of just raid nights, things like how much effort you have put into running things with other guildies so they could get pre-bis, how friendly and supportive you are, just generally being prepared, and of course, if it actually BENEFITS you. They want everyone to get geared, they don't want to just loot 5 people. 
---
(obviously, you still have priority for some things, but I have yet to see any very clear favoritism other than just general class/BIS priority)
---
I see, thank you for the detailed explanation! I was silly and re-specced prot at 49, so by the time I got to Un'goro I wasn't really able to solo quest anymore and didn't do the power crystals quest, although I am familiar with the cave you're talking about. 
---
As a prot warrior who's starting to get multiple pieces of T1 gear, I'm not entirely sure these are very beneficial for me anymore. Crystal Charge would be more beneficial of the two, but for most packs I can hold 4 relatively easy as long as my DPS let me. 
---
Does the Spire stack with a shield spike? I would assume so, since the shield spike isn't a buff but counts as an enchant, I just wanted to check. I'm using a Mithril Shield Spike right now (16-20 damage), but once I get Drillborer Disk I'll be upgrading to Thorium. 
---
I will keep the charges in mind for my druid I'm leveling, but since Spire doesn't stack with Thorns then I wouldn't need that.
---
This is utterly amazing - thank you for sharing; made my day.
---
Yeah I agree but if the dude signs up for dps he shouldnt get flamed when he doesnt want to tank. I always lfg myself as dps/tank and will join as either role (I'm always in plate gear anyway) but thats the way I want to play. If I wanted to strictly dps and was joined a group as a dps I shouldnt be flamed for it.
---
Depends on your current flurry uptime. Until you have a good flurry uptime crit has a ton of value. I'd wager Bhb is better atm.
---
Un'goro Crater
---
i'm in the same boat.  I think if you were a prot warrior, HoJ would generate more threat, but since you're Fury, crit will generate flurry, which is ultimately more as far as i can tell.
---
I tank with 3% hit and hoj/bb and as much str/agil/stam plate (which usually ends up being valor) so i can keep up with the higher and higher dps
---
and cute?
---
lol, once again the mage could just say no. Now you switched the terminology from ‚Äúhelp‚Äù to ‚Äúservice‚Äù very interesting. 
---
How come they don‚Äôt ask for money then in advance? No they rather passive aggressively demand a tip and complain afterwards. It‚Äôs so they can pretend that they selflessly help orhers when they are just greedy Magetards.
---
Time to start free server xfers.
---
No I am not.  You want the gold,  I just want the class book.  Pretty simple.  What are you just here to whine over me whining?  If you gave yourself an enema we could bury you in a matchbox.
---
It's very short, but it was a good series. I'd watch season 2
---
the 20$ belongs to someone,
---
the drop from a dungeon doesn't
---
It's a 50/50 matchup that is probably one of the most skill based matchups in the game. The problem is most rogues do not know how to get full use out of their CDs. This is a night and day difference from my experience on pservers
---

---
If you're interested in dual-wielding and aren't tied to those swords specifically, there's Bone Slicing Hatchet from Stratholme. Using two of those is almost as good as the alternative Peacemaker or Barbarous Blade.
---
Did the same thing a week or two ago to a gnome warlock with pink pigtails. Got a WF crit on top of that.
---
Do you have a link to all your gear? Kinda finding it hard to believe you got 29% hit unbuffed, are you counting agi totem as a ‚Äúunbuffed‚Äù stat? What‚Äôs your AP sitting at?
---
You dont account share. The Hunter who needs it just turns the NPC into the demon and you kill like normal, and the hunter loots his head.
---
Is there a healing priest build focused on Spirit Stacking and Spiritual Guidance/mana regen talents, instead of sHP + mp5 stacking?
---
Yeah, now they can all equip rune platebodies and green d'hide.
---
At least these guys are direct. The trolls are kinda passive aggressive:

I feel the same as you're feeling, I'm hoping the removal of the layer will make it seem more balanced. As of now it just feels like one layer is alliance heavy, and the other layer is horde heavy
---
Death knights have ‚ÄúRaise Dead‚Äù to have a permanent undead companion, along with ‚ÄúArmy of the Dead‚Äù, to raise a bunch of undead at once. 
---
Only difference between that and a generic necromancer is usually necromancers are solely spell casters, not melee.
---
Tauren is the fastest. Run out of start area, die immediately, rez at bloodhoof village, city is already in sight.
---
This entire comment chain is about whether or not layering increases server cap. You are trying to weasel your way out of a hole you dug yourself in. Sorry that the facts dont support you here bud.
---
So how is that a joke?
---
It's gotta be Mulgore. Those rolling plains, that sense of an endless world, it's really just relaxing and at the same time invigorating.
---
P A L A D I N
---
Most of these stories are the reason I dont do pvp servers anymore. I dont have time in my life as an adult to handle the griefing!
---
In stv a person was doing the quest that you have to gather 10 gorilla teeth, then  start quest where a bunch of gorilla's come in waves and on last wave a named one comes and you defeat them for quest.  Waited in area, saw the group have trouble and run away, i followed and tagged named monkey out of pack. Finished quest in like 2 minutes and usually it takes much longer.
---
I popped open a box for this guy and was shook when he tipped me 5G. Then on his next box he tries giving me another 5G but I told him the 5 was more than enough. After opening his final box he gets a Soulkeeper staff out of it. Moral of the story? Big tips = big loots. 
---
- Bonus story -
---
This other player asked me to open like 4 boxes for him, but said he didn‚Äôt have much gold to tip. So, I tell him ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry about.‚Äù (As I do with most people who say that or who ask me how much I charge). After opening his boxes he crafts a stack of mongoose pots and trades them to me and asks if that‚Äôs enough. (It sure fucking was) 
---
Those are my fav box opening stories. 
---
- Rhyn bloodsail bucaneers
---
So if Deathcharger drops and 4/5 group members already have their epic mount, should it automatically go to the one guy who doesn't?  It's an upgrade for him too.
---
Not all loot systems are corrupt and used to serve only a few members.
---
Yea tell me how a combat swords rogue is beating a frost mage in lvl 30 something stv pvp.
---
Mage blinks out of stun, lvl 1 frost bolt, game over
---
Level another mage :p or a hunt/warlock
---
Orc is one of the slowest tbh.
---
Either pet class, of note a warlock will be much less maintenance overall compared to a hunter.
---
That chicken quest in Tanaris made my heart ice cold. I would always try to make friends with horde, but now... Now all I see is red.
---
Shadowfang Keep
---
Hahahahahahaha
---
Why not just wait the extra 5 seconds and let the healer get full mana?
---
50s a box is too much. Much of the profit on the worst high-level boxes goes to the rogue.  25s a box is what I do with high-level boxes and 10s for lower level boxes. I always offer the boxes on a level 5 bank toon.
---
Noob here - do you mean the priest buff that increases stamina? How does that make them die (and wouldn't they die anyway from a high enough jump)?
---
I would think a warlock? They save money by not needing a mount etc.
---
Bandages and pots my boy.
---
You are referring to [Elixir of Tongues](https://www.wowhead.com/item=2460/elixir-of-tongues)
---
It is sold on all Retail servers, not just RP.
---
Will wow classic raid party thing suffice for raid healing. Or do I need to dl an addon
---
play Warcraft 3 my friend. 
---
warlocks have Death coil too and Siphon life which is clearly a necromancer or death knight spell. being able to do something in game is usually not mean the same in lore.
---
Its more like haven't had relationships. At all.
---
At least I have my car.
---
ALL the time, works great when balancing between alt play time
---
There's a slight delay in between looting a corpse and being able to skin it. As a druid, I stealth up while they are fighting it, hide inside where the corpse itself drops, and spam right click. They loot the body, I start skinning before they can. There's literally no way to stop me.
---
Watched it all in one setting over the weekend. Worth the weight gained for sure.
---
Edit: Even stopped playing WoW to watch it. Rested xp ftw
---
Warlock/Hunter arent bad choices as they sustain themselves very well with little down time. If you're wanting to aoe farm, then a Warlock isnt a bad choice as they can still aoe farm, albeit less efficiently than mages can.
---
Hunters are a good choice because it's easy to kite one mob to the next, and realistically have no down time.
---
As a 12 year old kid back then playing warlock as my first character, this broke my heart :( everybody disliked me
---
So, I went into WoW Classic trying to abandon my past prejudices, thinking that "Hunters won't be that bad, that was just in vanilla, where almost nobody knew what they were doing."
---
I was wrong. Most are still that bad. But at least I learned my lesson before losing anything truly great to a hunter. And now I've learned how to do the Drakk fight without kiting.
---
no thanks tbh.
---
/equip macros can do it all for you. Little tedious if you are changing item sets often. If you are pretty much bis you can just do the few slots
---
Yeah this.. I really cba to put stuff that goes for 2-5g on AH, so i send it directly to the guildbanker. Stuff i know is needed for crafting, and will help my guildies progress.
---
Do you have any numbers from say golemagg? hes the best target dummy in the raid
---
you think? i know as of right now you get a free one for High pop to Low pop. idk if you can pay for one or not or else i would hop on that train
---
17 runs, 0 rings. F

Why didn't they?? I've restored like 10 deleted toons over the years

---
My favorite place would be Azshara. There are certainly very few quests, but so many buried wonders there like the fallen statue of ravencrest, the tower on the northwestern shores, and the ruined temples. An impeccable zone to farm in with peaceful little nooks. If classic + ever happens I would hope they could find something to do with that zone.
---
They always charge in when they are in a group though. Alone, they are timid as rabbit.
---
Meta
---
Another warlock +1, free mount.
---
retail bad classic good XDDD
---
Here to tell you that you are selfish and acting like a child over pixels. Thanks for proving it all with your last response. The fact you just said I should give myself an enema and you could bury me leads me to believe that is a threat or suggestion of self harm. Reported.
---
Rogue flair and a basic sense of decency... Does not compute. 
---
Honestly I've been a bit annoyed at the complete douchebaggery I've witness without the honor system enabled yet. Like I expect it when people are getting honor, but I guess people just suck. 
---
I was rolling into WPL yesterday and there were a couple alliance sitting by the gate in. I was suspicious but I gave them the benefit of the doubt and rolled by. I'm 60 and reasonably well geared, they ignored me. I planned my camera back as I rode off to see them jumping a 54 priest who was a ways behind me and probably saw them let me through.... Needless to say I turned around popped recklessness and got a thank you from the priest over their fucking corpses.
---
The Undercity, FOR THE HORDE.
---
Feralas
---
I switched terminology because it‚Äôs what you are using. They are helping you by providing a service only their class can do. You on the other hand expect water to be free. Don‚Äôt need much more to know you are an entitled person. Have a good one
---
Because I'm laughing at you
---
My warlock feels right at home in Felwood
---
Yes but I can raid just fine with optional. The items are BiS lists are usually only marginally better.
---
BRD has a wide range of levels, you can definitely start it at 52, but likely won't be able to full clear just yet without higher level group members
---
Both horde and alliance dislike warlocks, warlocks should be well aware of the threat of the burning legion (and maybe wondering how to use it, ok ;), and a warlock priority would be power and knowledge, no where it comes from.
---
which is why in my headcannon warlocks would stand together without concerns for faction loyalty, and probably help each other when possible. Kinda like druids, but more prone to betrayals and in a more 'personnal interest' fashion...
---
Go level and learn the game, bye.
---
You think that's bad? Try being a necromancer in EQ...
---
something that is not always mentioned is that the holy water from stratholme totally works and will 1 shot the skeletons in a large aoe, however it shares a CD with your other pots.
---
That dungeon is a time sink along with all the time spent getting 5 people and bad RNG. When I bought the ring, it took 5 resets before I saw it and it got masterlooted to me immediately without rolling. I can't imagine running Mara 5 times and then losing the one roll. At 15 or 20g per drop, I would pay for it without hesitation.
---
This is essentially legal gold selling for irl cash.
---
This is bigger than layering, or any other economic change people were complaining about.
---
&gt;I would ensure that melee dps got priority on melee weapons and hunters would get priority on ranged weapons.
---
That's the point though, YOU may, but it's often manipulated and people buddy up and get what they want... and then quit.
---
&gt;My goal was to have a loot council consisting of me but also other people who I trusted, yet were not my friends, with a representative from each class. And the intent would be more to limit who got to roll on the upgrade, rather than assigning each drop to a specific person.
---
That sounds like the most important part of a council to work well, the other is making sure those people in charge are also not buddy buddy and looking to manipulate you.  If you can keep that key horror out of the council, it'll work great because everyone is on the same page.  But again... the worry is the easily corrupted system.
---
&gt;what do you feel is the appropriate way to handle loot?
---
Having raided as a Class leader in Vanilla and I also am a raider in FFXIV, I think it's two different beasts but also offers a point.
---
For FFXIV, we straight opt loot to DPS priority because the way raids on there are so fiercely connected to enrage.  Enrage is auto-death.  We (all 8) agreed MOST gear gets cycled to DPS first to clear faster.
---
The following weeks, we cycle through what DPS already have BiS to healers/tanks.
---
In WoW, it's the opposite.  Tanks need to be beefed up for some of the bosses heavy hits.
---
In WoW, I feel DKP would be best suited because it allows the raider to have control over their own loot to purchase and that the system is fair.  Saying it 'goes to waste' is a vague term, but in the long run, how people spend their DKP should fall on them.  It also guarantees consistency because you have to raid to get DKP.
---
When loot drops no one wants, half the DKP cost or if someone needs it and doesn't have enough DKP, put them in the hole for it.
---
My favorite place in WoW is still bloodhoof village. Brings back so many memories while questing there and is very peaceful. My OG char in vanilla was a tauren hunter. I still remember pulling that pack of wandering kodos thinking I could take them all with my pet. Def didn't make it
---
A BoE does not have double value to someone that can use it.
---
For someone that can use it, they can choose to auction it, or they can choose to equip it. However, these are mutually exclusive choices.
---
In case 1 the value is the AH value (aka exactly the same as the person who will not use the BoE)
---
In case 2 the value is the combat utility + vendor value.
---
In neither case are you getting double the AH value.
---
its an important concept to grasp, you can easily get scammed in out of game situations by not understanding it.
---
What I'm talking about is your critical strike rating of which rogues require 29 points at level 60 in order to gain 1% crit chance and as I stated before all of this only applies to rogues. Crit rating is even a stat which is put on gear in later expansions. So yes it does exist either way I was just trying to help give a basic understanding of the major stats for the rogue class I understand how the crit rating stat can be a bit confusing so I hope all of this also helps.
---
So you're mad because of supply and demand?
---
Man are you butthurt
---
That is completely stupid. A BoP cannot be sold for an amount of gold that would return the value. A BoE can. Try coming up with a thoughtful response next time. Needing on a BoP when someone actually needs it, is wasting the item entirely. Needing on a BoE is not.
---
And of course you couldn't come up with an actual response to my previous remark, and instead deflected with that dumb ass logic.
---
Zandalar Tribe is the server
---
Getting tilted from a ninja is what led me to binge Dark Crystal, so you could always try that - but there's some RNG involved there for sure.
---
Yeah, thankfully this has only happened once to me, but if he doesn't have the courtesy to say anything - hell, even /wave - then I ain't going to do shit
---
I assume it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs sending you to other faction‚Äôs territory or a spot where pvp is expected (like the burning man quests by UC for hallows end)
---
Most use a nepotism system
---
Another tip to use in a bind is the Thornling Seeds from Dire Maul. They will tank and distract the skeletons at the beginning of the cave.
---
&gt;do you mean the priest buff that increases stamina? 
---
&gt;How does that make them die (and wouldn't they die anyway from a high enough jump)
---
Fall damage is based on percentage of health but your hp doesn't immediately heal up to full when you get buffed.
---
You fort them, they get knocked down to ~80% hp, the fall damage kills them because it does ~80% of your hp in damage.
---
Well when I hit 60, I plan on going holy fully, but I'm trying to find the easiest path to 60, and I'm not a big ret fan
---
I know right?  Warrior are stellar at farming.
---
Winterspring, i love snowy zones &amp; there aren‚Äôt very many in classic, plus that purple skybox is just amazing
---
3 hunter slots, 4 hunters, we just rotate 1 out each week. Same (generally) for all classes that we have too many of.
---
Lol your loot leader is a douche, talk to him, call him out in guild chat, let everyone see how your being shafted
---
The reason ist that falldamaga is a percentage of your total health depending on the hight of the fall. The buff only increases your maximum health and not your actual health so is the percentage is higher than your actual health you will die.
---
It certainly can be played already. 5/8 T1, core leather gloves + perditions + corehound tooth or edgemasters + axes/swords, accuria, HoJ, ony neck, lionheart, onslaught, battleborn/domo bracers and you will put out amazing DPS while you re beefy. Problem is that most people arent there yet.
---
10 UD runs and counting. No xbow, i cant make loot show up with the force of my mind. I was the class getting to most out of the weapon.
---
But if they don‚Äôt then you make money. And you can be the one that‚Äôs outbidding and win
---
If the head is being displayed in Org on the pike, then you can still turn-in, but the buff does not go off.
---
Projection, you must be really fuming by this point. You mad bro because you sound really mad bro. Only one of us is calling names and responding like a nutjob and it is not me.
---
And people piled on me the other day when I complained about a single Diva tank as if they couldn't exist. lol
---
&gt;If anything, Blizzard should have left layering on if they wanted to keep server populations this high.
---
You were just complaining about trade goods. Layering increases the amount of nodes/rares that can be farmed by 100% for each layer.
---
&gt; they need to do a better job of mitigating the number of people logged in
---
Why? Just decrease your graphics options or point your camera at the ground when in a major city. That's what we had to do at peak times back in vanilla.
---
&gt;Any trade good that is capable of being farmed is so overfarmed and the AH is so saturated that prices have already fallen to vendor values.
---
So why do you want layering back?
---
I wonder how many actual players fall for this shit now days. I feel like people are pretty clued into these kind of scams.
---
Agreed 100% percent
---
I polymorphed a poor little level 40 rogue while he was doing the chicken escort in Tanaris and made him watch as the chicken slowly died to hyenas.
---
Emperor is 59 and enrages, I'd hold off until 56-57 min. Arena farms are easy and fast but not a ton of trash kills. Can do arena/golem/angerforge and that would be solid. Also start looking for DM groups at 56 too
---
This is why all the alliance left lmao
---
If I can sell it on the AH for XX it's worth XX. Doesn't matter who 'uses it.'
---
I am sure they will...
---
Gold is gold regardless if it's from a BoE or BoP. You are just bending the rules to fit them how you want them to be.
---
I‚Äôll keep you updated regardless of what happens.
---
I‚Äôm with you 100%. Being a lower level for a dungeon more so for dps and tank is the only time I think restrictions are necessary. I haven‚Äôt joined any dungeons unless I‚Äôm the recommended level. Also I hate reserve groups and never plan on joining one, especially if it‚Äôs something I need too. I much prefer the chance of getting it rolled off to anyone who needs it, makes it more exciting. Yeah you might get pissed you didn‚Äôt win but when you do it‚Äôs awesome.

My horse and I enjoy our bong rips together every morning, don't tell him how to live his live

You mean 4 mages? There're 3 mages in the guide already.
---
For real! It's amazing how people were surprised that I had capped out my lockpicking at 60. Like, it's not that hard? Just pickpocket like a good rogue to get that cash and often a box.
---
Better plot twist, Jeff Epstein
---
That's a very good point. PuG's can still earn and spend DKP. The motivation to join the guild would be found in being the priority for an invite, while a PuG could be left out.
---
I remember one guild I was in rewarding people with DKP for farming materials for flasks/elixirs/etc for raids, but somehow I think this would be a bad idea, as it swings the balance way in favor of, well, certain playstyles.
---
Since you've been so helpful, any idea where I can go to get started on a DKP system? Otherwise, I'll probably just google it.

Sword of Zeal is a good option too, for a third of the price.
---
Paladins are the most OP healers in vanilla for PVP and PVE. Near God level healer vs. a shaman.
---
The gold is definitely over 30 on my warlock, but I can consistently cap resets with 9 minute runs of tinkerer, herbs along the way, and princess.
---
This seems pretty fair and straightforward.
---
Best talent tree guide for dual wield dagger rogue??
---
Dude,  just get out of the thread if you are that dainty.  Nothing is keeping you here,  at least try to keep some dignity.
---
If you lose in 5 seconds you have bigger problems than wotf - you wouldn‚Äôt have stood a chance anyway.
---
If you have the gold, Krol or Sword of Zeal are both very close according to [Shadow Panther](https://shadowpanther.net/swords-pve.htm) , so go with the cheaper one. Zeal was 150g cheaper on my server but I didn‚Äôt realize how good it was so I bought Krol before doing enough research.
---
Farming for Dal Rends is your pre raid best in slot though, but after enough runs of not getting the swords, it‚Äôs probably worth it to buy the other sword and farm gold instead. Would take way less time.
---
I also play on Grob and I have been making an absolute killing selling mats on the ah. I farm daily and it's always good. I'm not sure what else to say really, hell I even got a black lotus at 6pm the other night. Doesn't seem too overcrowded to me.
---
and thats why he said he think you do but you dont. the whole vanilla idea was giving him ptsd. it all makes sense now
---
Teldrassil! It was my first WoW experience ever and it felt so epic that I still get the shivers, thinking back to that time.. I also remember that I was freaked out seeing the ancient trees guarding Darnassus, for the first time, not shure if they are friend or foe.
---
I forget what quest we were doing but I was helping some alliance out with elites that sheep the tank, so I would run over and smack the sheep to break it and return to dpsing the mob down with them. It was a good time.
---
Freaking night elves with their shadowmeld.
---
You are aware there's plenty of elitists in Classic that aren't from Retail, right?
---
Also, his response wasn't elitist nor was it that of a know-it-all.
---
Its like you just want to throw in some slight against retail, even if it's not related to the subject.  Get off that dick.
---
It's not ninjaing. It's pretty widely accepted that world drop epic BoEs should be needed by everyone in the group regardless of which BoE drops. This is because you can basically sell any BoE you got and then buy whatever BoE you need.
---
I see your point but I disagree with you. TBH you're just coming off as salty.
---
I can see being the case actually. There are entire guilds I haven't seen in weeks.
---
&gt;The initial vanilla servers were over crowded and people transferred away to new servers.
---
Right and even still, Blizzard has already said that there are more people on Classic servers than there were in vanilla.  Just because the servers are "more stable" doesn't mean that there's not an overcrowding problem.
---
&gt;The only issue here is people like you that have been holding out waiting for everyone else to transfer. Bite the bullet and transfer or shut up.
---
"People like me" - You mean people with friends and guildmates on a server that don't necessarily want to transfer with me?  I guess I agree, no one really wants to transfer.  That's why I said that this was poorly planned.
---
I tank too, but I don‚Äôt respec because it‚Äôs too expensive.
---
Here‚Äôs how to get more people on side: give healers your random mana pots and water at the start of a dungeon (even if there‚Äôs a mage, sometimes I‚Äôll bring mage water to the group!) and never pull when they‚Äôve got less than 50% mana even if they‚Äôre drinking; always gratz people on an upgrade; and pop cds to save dps that make a mistake. If you die always run back first and escort others. 
---
That‚Äôs really the best you can do right?
---
I‚Äôve always done this, and I get people message me to come tank for them even now full well knowing I‚Äôm dps main spec. 
---
Most my buddies are tanks, so I know exactly where you are coming from.
---
Best classic content video ive seen so far.
---
Was killing slimes in the Hinterland with another Alli Hunter. Our pets accidentally attacked each of us a couple times with no retribution. Feel good moment.
---
Woah, what a brilliant insight
---
My friend had same problem, was Titan panel that reserted the frames.
---
Not at all. Freezing band drops, I can sell that and buy edgemasters, meaning I equally progressed my warrior as much as the mage would have if he had won. That is fair.
---
BoP mage hat drops, I vendor it for 2g. That doesn't buy 1/100th of the edgemasters. That is not fair because the mage would have gotten over 100x more value from that item. I'm sorry you don't understand basic economics in MMO.
---
I heard it originates from retail arenas. They just used "cleave" to describe like everything.
---
Rolled UD rogue just for PVP. Some highlights:
---
Popped a speed pot and TWO sprints to chase down a hunter 10 levels lower with rez sickness.
---
Killed a gnome rogue doing an escort quest in Ferelas
---
Saw a druid pop sprint to catch the boat in Booty Bay, so I sapped him
---
Good times were had by all.
---
Yeah,  I am the one fuming...keep telling yourself that.
---
Dainty? Is that some kind of homosexual innuendo? Are you homophobic as well as selfish. Why are you begging me to leave. You really are mad now, huh. I bet it is almost boiling into tears, yet I am dainty. Classic projection. No worries Reddit will put you in the timeout box soon.

Trainers only go up to 150. You have to buy a book to get to 225 and complete a quest for 300
---
I was just throwing up a quick reply to answer his question. It's not a definitive guide. I find that a lot of new players have a hard time making sense of all the stats so I figured I'd help him out besides someone already linked a guide. Anyways I edited my original post to help him out more.
---
This isn't even a layering issue. Last time this happened on Herod a night elf Hunter was shadowmelded and using their pet to aggro the flight master via eyes of the beast.
---
The thread is pretty interesting before it devolves into a slap-fight between min-maxers saying paladins should never tank even with this (BECAUSEREASONS!)... Talks about how the internal spell id for RF is the same as it is for Defensive Stance, but gets kinda wishy-washy over the physical-vs-holy part.
---
Anyone who doesn‚Äôt resist fear ‚Äúoh I‚Äôm feared into 50% hp and I‚Äôm fre, oh no I‚Äôm feared again...‚Äù
---
it's honestly not even that. If you go to loot a lot of the times especially if the mob actually has loot your character takes a second to loot it and meanwhile the other person can be spammming skin so they almost always going to get it first. Honestly it sucks lol.
---
I was 60 and victim was 35ish. I kept him in a freezing trap for about 45min while waiting for a ZG raid.

Lol. This is the guy that got banned for buying gold in this thread is already back at it on a new account.

---
I agree with this. Blizzard announced several times the first couple weeks that queues were a problem and they couldn‚Äôt cut layers. They created tons of new servers and have offered several chances to transfer off realms, and in fact there are currently three servers you can transfer to from Grobbulus. I took a transfer of Thalnos to Netherwind and have loved it. Went from having my wife queue me up before I left work and still waiting an hour to playing immediately. If your current server is still so overpopulated then be the change, rally your friends and take the free server transfer. It sucks but it‚Äôs honestly not that big of a deal. If you don‚Äôt want to take the server transfer then I honestly can‚Äôt say I have any sympathy if your AH economy sucks or you can‚Äôt farm mats. Tough luck, that‚Äôs the repercussion for your choice to ride out an overpopulated server.
---
I haven't played hunter in a while but IMO I wouldn't spend that many points on increased pet damage without bestial wrath, otherwise your pet can just be chain CC.  I'd say VS melee MM would be better because scatter/feign allows you to reset, get distance.  VS casters it might be better to be BM.  Here are two specs I'd run.

For me personally I lived playing MM. I used to sneak up behind people and when they would sit to eat or drink I'd hit them with an aimed shot/multi shot combo which would usually kill them instantly. Plus with scattershot, if you cant win the fight, just scatter&gt;trap and run.
---
I usually never pvp and just play on a pvp server for the danger aspect.
---
After layering was removed I found myself getting cornholed about 10x a night in Tanaris.
---
The last few days I've spent time each night before I log off camping the graveyard to kill people who use rez sickness as well as killing AFKs who fly into Tanaris.
---
It's a lot of fun and usually results in me getting wrecked by level 60s who are pissed about their alts getting corpse camped.
---
Sure, it needs to evaluated in certain situations. Does the boss die before your first mana bar without pots runs out? No need for MP5.
---
No, you lose all recipes you've previously learned even if you decide to pick the profession back up.
---
You really are worried about this. My guess is this is OPs second account. Nice try, suck a block.
---
Yup. And ideally, I need 3 mageblades cause I have a Lock, Mage and Paly. 
---
I'd be happy to get 1 before BWL comes out.
---
Lulz. Still love it though.
---
We formed a raid to expell the group of 60s camping the flight path and tar pits. Un' Goro is like retuning to STV.
---
The real content videos will appear once those guys try clearing AQ and Naxx :D
---
I'm no type sure where this idea comes from, because it isn't true.
---
It isn't as strong as the first 5 or next 3 points, but going from say, 310 to 315 would net you essentially 1% crit, .5% less chance to be dodged, and .5% hit.  That is not "practically useless."
---
Going past 315 is where the value disappears.
---
I try to be nice to horde, but sometimes they're just idiots. My alt had to do the Troll ears quest in Zul'Kunda last night so I rode around flaunting my lvl 60 rogue on an epic mount so the horde lowbies knew of my presence and logged off. Then switched to my paladin. After a couple of mobs a group of three horde ganked me and a warrior emoted "/no". Yeah, then I switched to my main and murdered/camped them so they had to GY rez. 
---
I just wanted to quest in peace. :(
---
Watching a few guides, they say feralas is the place to go because you can max your fishing and cooking too (basically run them together) My cooking is maxed already so I was seeing if there was a better place. I'm going to trust people in stv to 225, then I'll bounce around and see where I can get some good fish. Feralas is first on the list.
---
Second or third to last, he says you here! Instead of you hear!

Is this where all the claws are coming from for lionheart helm?
---
Best post all week
---
What are you still here? What a strawmanning swine. Homosexual innuendo?  Are you fucking nuts?
---
Might not be ideal for exp, but you probably want to squeeze Phalanx in your runs until you get his helm. That will be very useful until Onyxia. At that point, I would try to clear all the way to at least the 7 dwarves.  
---
Emp is going to hurt big time until \~58, so you're going to want to trust your healer, but it's doable at 56ish.  
---
If you haven't done Onyxia attunement, do the prison runs for that and get your key. After that I would do Arena/Angerforge or Emp runs.
---
Ironforge. I‚Äôve played a dwarf for 15 years in WoW and many more before that. It‚Äôs my home and it‚Äôs glorious

Addons don't = bad player
---
Eastern Plaguelands.  When I think back to leveling my first toon a decade ago, this is the location that comes to mind as I spent so much time there questing and traveling to dungeons
---
My simple, though poor solution is to simply resign myself to never getting any loot from world bosses and pretend they don't exist.
---
I didn't even have to poit it towards the gae, it just scanned and detected it. might try reinstalling
---
I actually did the "lesser bloodstone ore" quest in arathi higlands with 2 horde yesterday on my pally.
---
What hole? I'm not the same guy you silly billy. 
---
GMs are not infallible. This has been known since WoW launched. Look at the GMs words: 'from what I can gather' - clearly he isn't completely sure himself. His, or any other GMs words, are far from 'fact'.
---
No agi totem included. Theres no armory right? I can post a pic after work, but Like I said, almost all BIS. Rag crown of destruction with 8 agi libram, Ony neck, devilsaur set, DM trib tarnished elven ring x2, tribute mail chest piece, DM west first boss crit agi belt. 2% crit trinket etc... Wyrmtongue shoulders for agi. 15 agi beaststalkers bracers. 7 agi to boots etc.
---
I do agree with you that it's easy to separate the two, and the impact those two types of changes have on the game are certainly different. But you can make arguments that even those convenience changes have an impact on the way players behave. Is it worth fighting for? Probably not.
---
For instance, with single item mail, I found myself vendoring more items or trying to sell it on the AH every time I went back to a city instead of just using the mail system as a "cloud bank" via an alt. Loot trading is even more noticeable, although I think it's a good change. The point is, why be so hardcore about no changes to the point where you rebuild ancient methods that actually hinder smooth game play, then allow convenience changes or mechanic changes like the one this thread is about? Why allow multiple items in mail, but also make the mail have a 1 hour transfer time? Both of these things change the way people play the game, but one made it in and the other didn't. I mean I'm still going to play the game, so it's not like a deal breaker to me either way, it's just interesting what they consider a viable change and what isn't.
---
For me it would have to be: Elwynn Forest.
---
The music, the lore. That feeling of starting out in a journey again. I have a lot of fond memories as a lad starting my first mage there and learning about the world.
---
Oh pipe down you pompous ass.
---
When I first came to vanilla, i started to play as warrior. To regen health after each fight, I‚Äôd use some pork ribs, wait till 1st ‚Äútick‚Äù of getting health occurred, then stood to sit again to use another pork ribs. I needed over 20 pieces to regen full health. I didn‚Äôt realize I just need to stay seating and the health would just regen. I hate warriors ever since.
---
Any leveling server would be a violation of blizzards terms of service, and this not permitted to discuss here. 
---
Leveling isn‚Äôt that bad. End game isn‚Äôt a rush. Take it slow if you need to and enjoy the journey.
---
Bitch session, guilds competing, drama...how is that not complaining?
---
There isnt. It's against tos and is bankable. If you do find somewhere that service requires you give up your account info which they'd end up stealing your account
---
Also 510 AP
---
Barbarous Blade from DMN is pre-raid bis for hunters atm, and just fyi - it's a 2H sword (not a polearm).
---
Thinking about rolling a NE I just love that race aesthetics, it sucks that they can't be mage so I'm thinking about a ne rogue but according to the internet they make the worse rogue. So I'm torn between ne rogue and ne druid as I'm not really a fan of the class Hunter. Any suggestions? This is my first time playing wow. Started out in bigglesworth with a hunter but switched to rattlegore and I'm now a gnome mage lvl 54.
---
&gt;is there any legit leveling service
---
Well, that's an oxymoron, so no. Any leveling service is by definition not going to be legitimate.
---
On top of that, they usually just bot your account. So you might as well roll the dice and just do that yourself. It's begging to get your account banned.
---
Thank you, I am actually interested (I feel I have to say no sarcasm).
---
It's interesting, because for both my father and I we used the game to cope with different traumas in our lives. As we slowly built up to other mechanisms of coping, we moved on to stronger or more relevant methods. It was like the first step on a long hike, but we did it!
---
&gt;You were just complaining about trade goods. Layering increases the amount of nodes/rares that can be farmed by 100% for each layer.
---
Again, you're oversimplifying what I'm saying.  There are a multitude of problems that come with overpopulation, trade good prices crashing is one.  It's not the only one.  It's not the only thing I care about.  If Blizzard is going to have massively overpopulated realms, then they need to keep layering on to mitigate the **other** problems.  They've already crashed the economy and as other people have already said, that cat is already out of the bag (the damage is already done).  Trade good prices basically never trend upward.  The fact that prices are already in the toilet for nearly every single trade good where I am is an obvious and clear indicator of a larger problem.
---
Never noticed that tree was a bear lmao
---
Darn is my fav city (next to exodar on retail). I wish they were more popular
---
Ungoro crater!
---
Locks crush mages. They are the most broken class in 1v1s lmao.
---
WTF
---
The biggest hurdle to playing a rogue has always been getting into a dungeon/raid team. The problem is that there's just so many of them. However once you manage to land a spot in a successful guild you'll be on easy Street.
---
And I said 29% crit unbuffed not hit. I use a 8 or 9% hit set with these items
---
I am fine with all members needing on that, yes.
---
I got my quest from the Undercity engineer

Stranglethorn Vale, because it is a bloody warzone and has monkeys of course!
---
Holy fuck, now I have a crush on Paul Rudd! That man seems amazing.
---
This really depends on how hard you're going for optimization.  If you are just going raid buffs you're sort of right (except rogues never really need 9% hit). 
---
Once you pass the ability hit cap, extra hit becomes less valuable until you hit the white attack crit cap, at which point it becomes your most value stat again.  It's not hard to hit the white crit cap if you go hard on world buffs.

I'm interested

The amount of karma (spiritual balance) on your real-life life decreased by a non-measurable amount.

You forgot to put an */s* at the bottom of your message.

**Can you undo it.**

No, that would need someone with godly powers.

Understanding sarcasm is not something that is given. Some people have a harder time to detect it than others, but it can definitely be trained by almost everyone in some capacity. And as long as you treat others with respect and don't make redundant commentaries to things on the Internet, or in real life, I think you will be O.K.

What kind of warrior dies to a rogue? Overpower and win. Most rogues avoid warriors in my experience.
---
Yep
---
I heard your mom has a cheap leveling service.
---
I wish Paladin was on Horde.
---
I made a NE priest on Skeram named Popup and shadowmeld in front of quest givers in Booty Bay to cause the guards to kill the unsuspecting horde.  This buffoonery has destroyed my progress on my main.
---
&gt;Right and even still, Blizzard has already said that there are more people on Classic servers than there were in vanilla. 
---
Which isn't an issue unless you are unwilling to adapt the tactics we used in vanilla to avoid low fps in cities. I'd rather have massively crowded cities now so that they are still crowded in a year. There is nothing sadder than going to a city in retail and seeing six people at prime time.
---
&gt;"People like me" - You mean people with friends and guildmates on a server that don't necessarily want to transfer with me?
---
You said they were complaining as well? So organize a move.
---
&gt;That's why I said that this was poorly planned.
---
Which is irrelevant as overcrowding is impossible to avoid. Even with a capped number of players at vanilla launch due to boxed game copies servers still ended up overcrowded because when the next shipment of boxes went out people would join their friends on the popular servers and not the new empty servers.
---
So your choice is overcrowding or not even being able to join your friends on their popular server because making new characters is locked.
---
cool bro story - none of that is relevant
---
also your guy is missing an arm
---
I want to know the other classes
---
Duskwood, so many legitimate great storylines going on and the leveling is so easy there.
---
Then your post is being summarized to "warrior has bad AOE threat and paladin has good AOE threat". Thanks for the insight I guess.
---
I'm looking forward to this when my lock is geared. Just park on my lowbie. Relog, and wipe the horde. Quest.

WoW had a MASSIVE impact on the relationship I have with my father. I could write a whole mini-series on that alone. The way we both used it to cope, the way we abused it at the cost of our physical lives and even the way it hurt and grew the relationship we each had with my mom. It's incredibly fascinating to me that so much of the turning points in my youth all fall back to an MMO. I'd like to go into it more one day :)

GPS is used for routing and both Bluetooth and WiFi can be used as directional beacons (wireless routers too!) for phones assuming enough are around.

I don't think they got any of it wrong, they have plenty of servers that arent full population, and most people actually want to see other players, being able to world pvp with others, not just walk around seeing one person every 50 miles apart.

Duskwood!
---
Thats a respectful point of view that I very rarely see in this argument. What bothers me is when people try to force me to give a 500g item to someone just because they were there, when I and everyone else in the party can benefit just as much from it. I don't care if I have to spend 2 minutes posting it on the auction house, then 2 minutes buying an item of equal value for myself with that gold. That is fair. That is not greed. I would not say one negative word if I lost an item I actually needed to someone for that reason.
---
LMAO!  This is so childish and petty it's f'n hilarious!
---
Do you have scheduled raid times? If so, anybody who can't hoof it to tribute buffs themselves don't get summons. Anybody who doesn't have a _really good_ reason for not hoofing it to raid also doesn't get summons.
---
I'm going to guess you also go out to Azshara with a couple other people to summon for quints before/after raid?
---
You got recruited to be a summon bitch. Find a different guild.
---
You should save the hellcaller for hydrospawn, he does a ton of damage. Then just dismiss him and dot him, kite like hydro
---
Sounds like something only Blizzard can answer. I haven't seen any news about this happening to others.
---
it looks so fucking baller on tauren as well but nothing compared to the massive raptor
---
Yes, certainly. But the problem is that the debuff slots are so valueable. I get to play arms during phase 2 taking up one slot but only because we're already farming it. If you're not farming it benching that shadow priest and taking a stronger class would make progress easier.
---
And like you said, you perform well because the others are bad. If that's the case I don't see why a hybrid would be a problem, since they aren't the issue to begin with.

I use the modifiers just like G09G does, however I use MB4, MB5, E and Middle mouse click for the 4 totem types(much easier IMO than moving up to the F keys, especially if your looking to drop a grounding totem in a pinch quickly and reliably). The primary totem I almost always drop is the unmodified button (WF, Strength of earth, mana spring, fire totem). This makes for an easy time throwing them down every pull, then I use the modifiers  for other totems in the same group. For instance, MB4 is WF, MB4+Cntl is Grace of air and then I use cntl+alt for the other modifier, alt for another and so on.

I really enjoy druid.  But if you‚Äôre playing a druid, don‚Äôt expect to be playing a mage.  You‚Äôre a priest/warrior/rogue kind of ish.  It‚Äôs okay to pick a non-optimal setup though, so don‚Äôt feel wrong if you want to play a rogue.
---
Oops, yeah that's the one I'm talking about, his bis item which he can solo farm (I linked it to him and told him). He said he used some addon which told him it was bis so while he was incorrect I don't think it was intentional. Helped de-tilt me and not go off on him too bad :P

I'm a dad and I let my three year old son make toons to roam around and beat up bad guys. Reading this reminds me that I need to make WoW something we can do together and bond over. Great write up and thank you for sharing.
---
Can I ask if you are max level or JUST hit max level? Skeram is one of the strongest raiding servers for Alliance, the only negative is our total amount of players.
---
I swear warrior tanks are some of the most whiny entitled people who play this game. 
---
Buddy, no one cares about your opinion. You do you. But you trying to justify it just seems pathetic. Making it out like it's for the greater good and all tanks are United as one bullshit. You just want a purple weapon.
---
They tend to only pick fights where they have a good advantage. Straight up 1v1 I believe mages destroy rogues but hes catching you with your guard down and gaining a large advantage from it. It's what stealth classes do well.
---
rogue can't beat mage without free action potion. Like at all.
---
they stun you, you blink. They blind you, you ice block.
---
open on them with polymorph, then heal, evocate, and kite them forever.

** to Shatter... its a 25% increase when a mob is frozen from frostbite, or nova...  When not immobilized due to ice, it yields 0% increase.
---
Great copypasta, but 15g? holy fuck thats cheap, they are 40g on herod now.
---
It's called a discussion about the upcoming state of the game, notice how at no point did I complain about it or ask for changes?
---
I am a lock so I howl (group) or fear (single) the mob they are attacking. Several times it results in them pulling too many other mobs and theh have to flee or die.
---
As a warrior, I feel that if I see another warrior of the opposite faction out in the world, a duel to the death is about to go down.
---
The best part about this, is that I don't have to see any chats spammed with 'inv for layer plz' anymore.    
---
Now those people have to actually deal with other players in the game (regardless of faction), and I couldn't be happier about it.
---
Haha I will. I'm not as much of an asshole this thread makes me out to be.
---
In general, the default cross-faction 5man tank is fury-specced warrior with a shield getting their pre-bis gear for raids, who has a shield Most people are grateful for them swapping out leather pieces for actual plate (and that's not so common btw).
---
This is the smart play, or just relist them. Either way it's the best solution to poorly priced items.
---
Other's pettiness is a petty topic.
---
I need to know what happened back in Vanilla.
---
Rogue question - Which weapon is better for MH, Thrash Blade or Cho'Rush Blade?
---
by helping them with their quests , its a real mind fuck for them
---
While this is a huge change that will make life hell for warriors, it does prove to have one positive outlook.
---
Blizzard is not as dedicated to #nochanges as we may have originally believed. This proves they are willing to make tweaks to Classic that differ from vanilla. Hopefully they tune the world bosses to be more difficult, and possibly make some tweaks to certain classes and raid encounters as well.
---
Exactly!
---
Nah, Im just stating some facts. The upgrade isn't that much and the proc doesn't worth.
---
For autoattacks you want as many hit points you could get.
---
Jesus christ why would you admit something like that
---
I got one off an ogre in deadwind pass.

Confirmation bias.. "why x always y?" They aren't, you're just seeing it that way because you want to.

As a shaman, purged the disguise of an Human Warrior while waiting for Highlord Taelan Fordring to spawn. He spawned just after he was purged!

Wow, that's a lot of work, congrats! That would honestly be exciting to see so many people online and raiding all week.
---
I got [Crusader's Leggings](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10199/crusaders-leggings) of Healing (mail, +48 healing) as a world drop. I know that healing power is the top stat for holy paladins; is this likely to be valuable to paladins who are having bad luck in or can't be bothered to farm BRD, or does the low overall stat budget make it vendor trash?
---
Staff for pvp tho
---
Alliance mage here. Theramore is the move
---
... what?
---
illidan suffered from overcrowdness all the time.
---
over half the new server they created ended up being ghosttown.
---
they didn't get it right 15 years ago, not by a long shot.
---
the 'right' solution would've been to make sharding/layering permanent... but blind idiots QQ'd too much about it.
---
Think of it this way: Dot's can make up half of a locks DPS. That half is still ticking while we deal with fight mechanics. Since most dots are insta cast(shakes fist at immolate). We can re-apply them while dealing with the said mechanics and cast shadowbolts when we can stand still.
---
Remove the dots... and welp, there goes half our DPS.
---
Just make sure you roll on whatever bow/gun/xbow drops as revenge.
---
Healers are a dime-a-dozen.  Tanks are always the limiting factor.
---
You set the price. If you wanna do 500g do that. If someone's making thousands if gold 500g of that for a month of gametime is nothing
---
I remember the griffon feather quest in the Hinterlands having a PVP tag beside it because it sent me beside the alliance camp to kill the griffons. I'm sure there are others that are similar.
---
Log your kills, bench your worst performers. Rotate one or two in to give them a chance to show out. Continue to bench lowest performer.
---
Until you realize that mailbox is 50 miles away from AH.
---
So you just made my case for me. Now you have an issue with the mana cost. It's a 30 second CD for 1 talent point that can save you. Go spend that 1 talent point better than you don't play a pally
---
My favorite place in Classic WoW is programmer's island. It's filled with rare sights and it's a secret to everybody.
---
It's just good manners to make a portal for everyone after a dungeon... 20s is like 1 or 2 mob kills, I always make UC/Org after a dungeon
---
The Barrens
---
I do this too. I'll always save lowbies if they're about to die to mobs unless they're on my KoS list for camping a guildie.
---
The Blizzard raid frames can only be shrunk so small so it can get annoying for space. It's certainly doable esp if you setup some mouseover macros
---
Grid2 might be a good option, it simplifies raid frames and shrinks em down
---
Shame there's the same amount of competitive guilds on Skeram on both sides even though they have 4x as many players on Horde  
---
Also Org is the hub for all of horde. Alliance is split between chilling in IF and heading to SW for the buff.
---
1k Needles
---
I have a spreadsheet for this as well. I'm right around 1 standard deviation below the mean in drops, but the kicker is losing all 3 rolls in 50/50 situations
---
Ty 
---
But now I cant cast it on my own with holding alt. Is there a way to fix that?
---
The Guy Fieri episodewas pretty great
---
Just to note, if you have a raid id and lets say you do 50% anyone 1 person in that raid id can make a raid and finish it.
---
Man, I would've whispered the healer and told him to heal everyone but the tank, when he dies 3 or 4 times he would ragequit but he would have to spend whatever he won by needing in repair costs. Payback's a bitch.
---
Unfortunately, friend pally, in Legion I killed many of your kind as Horde Demon Hunter because tank spec is mindless attacks and I accidentally kill anything that gets too close, luckily that's nerfed now.
---
Nah put it up, those always sell well.
---
There is a pretty good chance that he gives you a legitimate tip once you trade them back.. ensuring he actually got them back before giving you gold/more silver.
---
It never will be. Between the load screen to get to it (because it's not actually part of Eastern Kingdoms) and the lack of flying (because it's a fake city like old Stormwind and Ogrimmar) neither BC will ever be relevant.
---
I'm saying that the constant bickering over loot rules and who can have what and so-and-so needing whatever and all that is one of the worst aspects of the game.
---
Agreed. BOEs are for selling and everyone can use some more gold.
---
Ironforge. It‚Äôs awesome seeing it active again
---
DKP is a great system which is why it still exist but there are many drawbacks like all systems
---
   
---
1. DKP is a game inside of a game.  You have to keep track of the dkp of all other players who could roll against you on an item and try to cause them to spend as much dkp as possible.  Lets say a very contested item drops and you know the other person has 225 dkp to you 220.  If you know they will spend w/e to get it many people will just instantly bid the 220 forcing the other player to spend ALL their dkp.  Sometimes people collude on drops stating to others that they will roll by  themselves for a drop then not try to outbid each other to save them both dkp.  Many more similar issues.
---
2. players who are benched gain the exact amount of DKP as those currently raiding otherwise you could never have a bench.
---
And a tree!
---
Didn't guilds have sign ups or something to prevent bs?
---
Even if they server pops were the same as vanilla it wouldn't make the economy the same. I rarely saw a mage AOE farming in vanilla. Now they are everywhere. Having lots of people who understand the potential of a class like that fundamentally alters the supply of resources.
---
I usually just give waters for free if people ask me while I'm doing auctions in Org. Everyone gets 120. If you try to tip me 10s I just give it back, if you tip me 1g or something I'll thank you and take the money
---
For me dkp is the best system out there. The drawback are people who willingly or unwillingly keep their dkp to abysmal amount, then outbid everyone on extremely rare drops but get the more common drops for low amount of dkp later. The solution is dkp decay (like 10% of your dkp is removed every 1-2 weeks for every raider) but people who don't get their drops at all are salty about that. Still better than any other system.
---
As I mentioned, benched people get full dkp for the raid as long as they confirm their presence after each boss.
---
Our system is:
---
10% decay every 2 weeks
---
10 dkp for every boss down
---
30 dkp for the boss downed for the first time (disabled until BWL)
---
10 dkp for the beginning and end of the raid
---
closed bid system (you whisper your bid to the ML, those who bid more get the item, if the ML needs item himself, he has a deputy for this case)
---
Negotiations between members are heavily discouraged 
---
There are also other DKP tweaks posted in this sub.
---
Sorry for late reply, Gouge and kidney depends if you can spam stealth fast enough and have the stealth CD up to since it‚Äôs 10 seconds normally but 5 seconds in the subelty tree.
---
**TL;DR**

Trading retail gold for classic gold is **NOT** a supported transaction. 
---
----------------------
---
FACTS
---
* It is against ToS to trade currency for real money. 
---
* A trade of gold in retail is **only** supported in the context of trading of gold in retail. 
---
* A trade of gold in classic is **only** supported in the context of trading gold in classic.
---
* Only trade with those who you trust.

Looks like gray lines, and the potential to be smacked for large quantities
---
You completely backpaddled on your statements and its still bullshit
---
It's fun destroying horde. Posts like this make it worth it.
---
I just binged watched it this morning while farming elementals in WoW.  Duel monitors for the win!
---
There's a potion that lets you understand the other faction. So both people need it to actually communicate. And it's great.
---
There's free transfers off Grobbulus, I recommended utilizing it.
---
It's not wow related. 
---
She lied and conned me into calling 911 and sending the police to her house when she was mad at her mom.
---
I was on the phone with her, and all of a sudden she said, "What? What are you doing? Get your hands off me! Stop touching me!" and then I heard screaming as the line went dead.
---
I called 911, and they sent the police to their house. My sister in law falsely accused her mom's boyfriend of hitting her, because she was angry her mom took the door off her room. Thankfully the police saw through her lies. My mother-in-law took the door off her room because she kept closing the door when boys came over, something she wasn't allowed to do. She bragged about it the next day at school. She was grounded for a month.
---
We have a raid sign up channel in discord and we post the sign up for the next raid at the end of our current raid night. 
---
Only members who have been promoted to ‚ÄúRaider‚Äù rank in guild are given permission to view the channel. They can click their class/spec icon and it puts them on a list under their class or roll with their name and the order they signed up.
---
Darkshore. It's just so spooky!
---
..AND MY AXE!
---
Rouge vs Mage really is the fairest non-mirror match-up in the game probably. I do think the Rogue has a little advantage in the open world because of stealth and the ability to pick a time to fight, but it's a fantastic matchup overall.
---
I love Felwood. It really drives in the "home-stretch" feeling for me, and reinvigorates my passion for hitting 60.
---
If you are horde it can proc with windfury
---
It's crazy that as a Horde you practically are forced to visit Exodar more than Silvermoon in retail
---
&gt;Yea, you're having a hard time comprehending what I'm saying, clearly. Maybe english isn't your first language so I'll try and clarify
---
Wow, you're a douche.
---
Git gud, how bout that? Learn how to make money, everyone else on grob has figured out ways of doing it just fine. You're farming trash and wondering why no one wants to buy it.
---
&gt; hey have an uncanny ability to catch me oom or with guard down.
---
Do not pull multiple mobs.  Download a spy addon to read the combat log for enemy spells.  Put on the highest armor and stamina gear while leveling.
---
Uhhh, are you having a stroke? You responded to me, incorrectly. You were wrong. 
---
Your comment on ‚Äúantennas‚Äù is cute too. Totally wrong. Phones use WiFi routers to increase GPS accuracy too and guess what, they‚Äôre smaller than drones. 
---
‚ÄúAntenna would have to be bigger than microwaves‚Äù
---
LTE signals run in the 85-420cm wavelength and your phone picks those up too.... hmm.
---
And you've never seen this before? That's actually kind of suspicious that they might not be honest with the state of "layering" (in quotes because it might be sharding at this point in cities).
---
&gt; When layering is eliminated, the impact is felt heavier as horde.
---
Both horde and alliance will feel the greater impact.
---
This isn't going to cause the factions to balance. It's going to accelerate the imbalance. Now even MORE of the minority faction will leave.
---
You can trade classic gold for retail gold. It's just trade at your own risk.
---
Yeah.  Everyone calls Thrall "Green Jesus," but really, Grom was the one who died for our sins and in doing so, redeemed us.
---
retail bad classic good upvote
---
&gt;why greed when it is something you can learn?
---
Because if it is a particularly expensive pattern you are effectively telling your groupmates that since it happens to be in your profession that you are going to take that opportunity to make gold from them.  
---
If a 100g pattern drops why should I have to pass on it just because it is in your possession?  How do I even know you are going to learn it?  How do I even know you have that profession?
---
When it comes to very cheap or common patterns / items I don't really care but I take issue when people claim they should have the right to a 100g+ item over everyone in their group just because they can put it to use.  I would make the argument that I could sell it and put the 100g to just as much use.
---
The other day axe of the deep woods dropped in my group and even though that's soemthing I would have equipped had I won I recognize that its kind of bullshit to take a 200g item from my groupmates.  We all needed and it went to a priest who ultimately sold it.
---
I think priests can mind control, buff the opposing faction with... I wanna say power infusion? Whatever one gives the player +25% incoming crit chance, then FUCK them up
---
&gt; we've all seen the screenshots of the clusterfuck that's currently happening in the major cities. 
---
I haven‚Äôt. Personal experience has been buttery smooth and it‚Äôs tons of fun seeing all the people in IF. Also on Grob
---
Also we finally got WPvP city attacks where you don‚Äôt get screwed by layers I‚Äôve never been happier. Feel free to use the free transfer out though.
---
Thanks. I figured that's what was going on but was confused by the "logging on 2 hours early" part. I guess he's just saying you can't get the buff unless your raid comes online before the others.
---
I don't think they ever give up. A few weeks ago I saw one close to the flight path in burning steps, chasing a lvl 52.
---
Arena spamming is probably the best XP.  Especially since you want a hand of justice.  I tanked Emp at 56 but I was also prot spec.  It may be tough as Arms/Fury since I had to end up popping last stand then shield wall and improved shield block helped me not get crushed.
---
The logic is more like:
---
Raid is on Tuesday
---
I‚Äôm either competing for a spot, or people are depending on me
---
It‚Äôs Sunday and I have 3 hours before I have to pick me kid up from soccer practice
---
I would like to get my BIS trinket
---
What is the most efficient route
---
The exchange rate is different, obviously. I don't think anyone would trade 100g Classic for 100g Retail.
---
Were going to be using LC, but the first couple runs were joint raids with other guilds, and then last week we still had some pugs in the group, so we had to use rolls.
---
My main is a Lock and there were a group of Horde toons sitting up on the front of the boat trying to avoid visual but I caught a glimpse of their Tauren Shaman trying to hide himself around the brim.  Howl of Terror'd him (as I didn't know he has a druid and rogue in stealth) and they all ran away in fear and the rogue fell off the boat.  Great times.
---
While I was trying to get my Mallet of Zul'Farrak for Carrot on a Stick I ended up doing my Jintha'Alor quests at the same time. Unfortunately this meant that I needed 20 vials of tainted blood which were worth quite a bit of money and XP on turn in.  Not the simple speed run I had intended, but what the hell I'm here so I might as well do all the quests, right? WRONG.
---
Because this was not what it appeared. You see these vials aren't mob drops like any sane designer would implement, no these are OPEN WORLD DROPS. So if course the damn dps in my party shamelessly ninja looted every single one of them while I, the tank, was busy fighting the mobs and keeping their scummy asses alive. You know, *like the whole group is supposed to do*.
---
Now a smarter person would have just seen an item collection quest in a dungeon and hammered the abandon quest button like it killed their parents, but I am a tank so you all know I am stubborn as hell and not all that bright.
---
I proceed to run that dungeon on a loop four times (each time netting one or two of the twenty vials I need) only for the dps to then thank me for the run and peace out right before the final boss--which is the only reason I even came to this god forsaken dump.
---
By run number five I was feeling like a real piss baby and upon seeing the same cycle repeat I decided it was time to exact my revenge. 
---
(Note that these were totally new people from the party I started with. They had no idea what I had been through that day or that they were part of a vicious and ungrateful cycle of me shepherding dps uneventfully through this dungeon with zero wipes and everyone finishing their quests but me, but I digress)
---
So one of the new people happens to be one of *those* warlocks. You know the ones. And he of course is casting aeo before I have even landed a single auto attack and aggroing mobs with his pet, you know, like one of *those* warlocks. 
---
So I do the only rational thing that my enraged self could think of, and I just let him pull mobs and die repeatedly while I ninja looted every bowl of blood in sight, left the group, and hearthed out. 
---
I'm not proud of what I did, okay, I'm not, but if it were you, I tell ya, if it were you I know you would have done the same. Fucking ungrateful dps üò§
---
Okay so I have narrowed my original 2 choices down to 5 choices and back down to 3 choices again. I have a 22 mage, a 17 rogue and a 11 priest. 
---
I really like Mage play style and its been my main on retail since Wrath but honestly Ive been an Arcane mage for life. And I will only be happy running PoM Pyro set or finding some arcane missile build. Mages just dont feel the same between Classic and even BC let alone my normal char.
---
I love healing dungeons, especially since I play solo 99% of the time. Playing healer will allow me to find dungeon groups super quickly and possibly pug raid groups. I honestly see no downside to this except I like to only do Shadow PvP, which is commonly looked down in PvE especially raid pugs. This is a strong contender but Im also a huge fan of Shadow Word: Death in BGs. Gimme that execute and the deathblow. Maybe Im too picky here and should go with this but something just isn‚Äôt right.
---
Solo pvp is my main forte and thats where feral druid or rogue come in. Well since feral is basically useless in classic I went with rogue. Im having a lot of fun here, A sneaky Warrior while leveling with Sinister Strike + Evicerate but I really have no idea what Im doing in the long run, strats, rotation, CDs, etc. Plus the gear competition for a rogue who will 99% of the time pug is going to be extra tough.
---
TL;DR: I want to play Solo and mainly PvP. Im stuck between playing my normal main Mage, the fun healing PvE and Shadow PvP Priest, or the solo king rogue. I CANT CHOOSE. Help me decipher?
---
Furor is good but early on it‚Äôs only so worth it. Not worth it enough to delay important talents like Feral Instinct, Sharpened Claws, or Feral Charge. Those will be incredibly helpful as you level and tank dungeons. 
---
After you hit 31 in Feral, then take 5/5 furor. Improved furor is something to consider for later, but Omen of Clarity is a great talent you don‚Äôt probably don‚Äôt want to skip out on (although you‚Äôre pretty much only going to unlock it at 60)
---
I honestly think "Teaching new players to play" is a great skill people need to learn.
---
That... and patience.
---
"Smh, c'mon y'all, it's really not that hard"
---
That makes a lot of sense at first glance, but I expect soon, if not already, you'll start getting well-geared players who'll just accumulate DKP without spending any because they don't need much/anything else (in phase 1 and 2 at least). I hope once you start DEing things the bench jockeys need you'll take that into account.
---
Right? I'm a NE rogue, so what? I easily out dps every fury warrior that I group with.
---
"The right solution would have been to play retail with a vanilla theme"
---
It's because there are people don't equip boe and put it up on AH later.
---
That's why I ask people to roll need on BoE blues and epics. No room for drama.
---
replace herb for mining, feed the engineering
---
This happens because of players, regardless of faction.
---
Tale as old as time.
---
Line 6 of your screenshot. 
---
&gt; It is not a supported transaction.
---
I did not say it is not allowed. Nor did they explicitly say it is allowed.
---
He sells the recipe for trifle? I'll have to go find him
---
Did you ever reconnect with your dad? Now that you're older you realise that he is trying to cope with his PTSD? Perfect ending would be if you 2 started playing again but together :)
---
ClassicLFG still works great. It just scans the chat channels you are in and makes it so you can sort by dungeon.
---
I just came to say I would downvote twice if I could.
---
It looks like ZF or lasher farming+herbalism. I just changed to a variation of the 'elemental' spec that Frostadamus mentioned on his channel recently in his video about ZF farming. I was able to easily kill DM lashers at 59 with my regular frost-aoe spec, though, so I feel like with less gear DM might be a better option, especially if you have herbalism.
---
I practiced the 'elemental' spec in SM GY/Lib/Arm/Cath last night and it was rough at first but got better with some practice. I'm still not great at it, but my gear is lacking, too. I think with better gear (especially some more stamina), I'll have an easier time.
---
Cool, thanks!
---
You visit exodar as a horde Player? When? (i dont play retail)
---
Yeah, no...
---
Well yeah but if you are lacking hit it's great
---
Poison on both, usually insant.
---
THATS FUCKIN RIGHT! Don‚Äôt mess with the horde!
---
I enjoy Undercity the most. It‚Äôs the first major city I visited back in Vanilla. The music, sounds, and ambiance are very nostalgic for me.
---
Kurinnaxx.
---
Oh my. LOL I bet he felt great that night.
---
It's like "you there" but you say "you here" when physically closer.
---
Lots of higher pop realms got off layering this week,  so that might be increasing your latency,  especially in high pop areas like cities
---
The 'raid frames'? You should be able to size it however you want...
---
This but I use the savory delight to become a female human rogue and people don't kill me lol
---
This is some sweet vengeance.
---
Against the opposing faction this is all fair game. You did well!
---
If they are just rolling a character now, then they will probably be ready to raid with a lot of people's alts. 
---
Since a lot of mains are mages, it should stand to reason that not many alts will be mages. They would have a hard time finding a raid spot with most classes anyways as raids are starting to become more set in stone at this point.
---
Only half?
---
&gt;I think you need to critically think about this issue, you're essentially arguing over contradictory things and being a condescending asshole while doing it. Neither are good looks.
---
Okay then, name the contradictory things that I'm saying and quote me the text where I said them.  I'll wait.  I'd also like you to show many any aggregate data that shows where trade good prices have ever trended upward in the medium or long term.
---
Free door hanger! Yeah boi!!!
---
Good rogue. Hope you added him.
---
The point is you're complaining about world pvp on a pvp server. You chose this life. The 2 60s saw you attacking their faction, of course they will kill you and camp. I'd do it if I saw an ally doing it to a horde. Thats pvp dude.
---
I have all my different totem elements bound to keys that switch to a new actionbar with all my totems of the element on it. 
---
Q is my regular action bar with lightning bolt, shocks, and healing spells
---
E is earth totems
---
R is fire totems
---
F is air totems
---
V is water totems
---
For the longest time I had a really hard time trying to figure out how I would use all my totems, but this way I can easily reach them all without moving my hand much, and with a bit of muscle memory it's super easy to switch and have everything in the same spot.
---
Ah, never seen a guild leader referred to as GM, so was throw off because of that. 
---
But like I said, I can kind of see how that could be annoying. But it‚Äôs not the biggest of issues and definitely something the father should‚Äôve intervened with but I still find it weird that it would cause problems.  
---
I‚Äôm honestly trying to think of I‚Äôd get mad if someone (especially a guild or) would follow me and help me kill mobs.  
---
Not steal, not grief, just follow and help. 
---
I suppose I‚Äôd find well weird but to ha e a proper problem feels a bit over the top. 
---
But people are different and what isn‚Äôt an issue to me is an issue to others and vice versa. 
---
Essentially, the situation just needs more communication. Especially from the father.
---
It's not bis, the polearm from strat and sword from dm tribute (which a hunter can solo!) are both better.
---
To clarify, I don't have any issues with guilds hoarding resources. It was my first raid with them and was excited to roll out my 315 skinning, and ran into "give that to me, don't skin that" with no explanation.
---
And the account is back! [https://i.imgur.com/YBbK3VH.png](https://i.imgur.com/YBbK3VH.png)
---
Yeah, it was wonderful. Fortunately everyone thought it was hilarious and no one rage-quit or anything.
---
I wonder if this still applies to poly. While leveling I would tag a knoll group with a caster, sheep the caster and kite the other to reset. Kill the caster then aoe the group
---
Not super terrible but I felt kinda bad after. Was completing the Cuergo's gold quest where you have to find the point at the very south of Tanaris, interact with the flag pole and then 5 mobs appear to attack you. The first time I tried I end up dying. Run back there and lo and behold there is a gnome mage doing it and using AOE to take down the mobs. So naturally I respawn, stealth (rogues rule), wait for him to get close to the mobs and then stunlock and kill him. I then proceed to kill the mobs he had brought down to low HP and get the treasure. I should mention the walk / corpse run down there is brutal. Sorry little gnome fella...
---
I love this story so much! Out of curiosity, is your dad retired, and what did he do before if so? I always envy those with parents so open to the idea of playing, and even role playing in this case. Always wonder what type of life people who are open to this lead and have led.
---
No GM name, no documentation, tokens are soulbound in retail and thus not tradable (despite OP talking about trading tokens)-- this reeks of a troll.
---
Lol. You must be on Kurinaxx. I‚Äôve been killed by that guy quite a few times. Never stood a chance.
---
Go look at bis lists for hunter. Everyone seems obsessed with them, so it shouldn't be too surprising when hunters follow the lists. 
---
I'd never take the rend set. Barberous blade is much better. I'd only take rend set if i could get 15 agi enchant on them both. Either way i don't want to deal with people crying over my rolls. 
---
I find it funny how people always complain about hunters, yet dps wars roll on pretty much everything (leather, mail, plate).
---
World bosses are really not worth the crazy drama of having 2 guilds under 1 name.
---
What will happen with these Zerg guilds in bwl/aq, is there will be an A team and B team and all those guilds will implode.
---
As /u/JustTray is saying, the mage class is almost built to own rogues... so you're likely only getting jumped by very good rogues absolutely waiting until you're disadvantaged... because otherwise you'll obliterate them.
---
Hopefully it was permanent your post history reveals a LOT
---
Just in terms of economics:
---
Having a lot of people would not make make prices fall. If anything, the only reason they are so low is due to the current distribution of player levels. 
---
When you increase pop, you not only get more supply, but you also get more demand. Due to resources having a finite quantity (due to re-spawn timers and limited resource nodes), the overall supply can't change that much. Getting rid of layering would actually lower the supply of resources on the server. Now you could say, well not all of the resources were being used originally and now that there are more people, the amount of resources exploited has increased. Yes, that's true. However, the overall supply of resources can't go past a certain point, while the demand for those resources has skyrocketed due to the population.
---
Nah I'm on Herod

It's risky since you can get banned or muted for cross faction communication.

Just report it as an error. Maybe it will get fixed

‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to flex that I‚Äôm killing bad players at travel hubs but cloak it in a subject so it doesn‚Äôt look like I‚Äôm flexing‚Äù FTFY

If it ends up being true (which I hihgly doubt cause 3-4 times more than retail? no way) I will gladly admit I was wrong but I am getting sick of people flashing these out of context screenshots without any value at all and claiming such things.
---
Some quest line during Legion IIRC
---
Did you forget you [Deleted]?
---
But you're complaining about item values and in the same breath want layering back.  Theres one.
---
Pre 1.8 AV. I loved the week long killing grounds and the push for getting all the summons out together to make the push. Seeing all the same people in the same AV time and time again even after having to get off for bed and then getting back on after school and seeing some/most of the same people getting back in or still being there. It was an absolute bloodbath but described wow perfectly. It was literal Warcraft being made there. I remember how shocked I was the first time seeing one of the elemental bosses being summoned and going how the hell do we take that out.
---
"makes a balding human male rogue named Roguein"
---
Ive opened probably a hundred boxes, haven‚Äôt seen anything great, got a few low level blues but not quite twink gear. I tell people to mail them to me so i can peek inside before i mail them back. Occasionally ill skim an item when theres two greens inside, if it contains something worth auctioning i will swap it with one out of my bank that has a shitty vendor ‚Äúof the whale‚Äù item.
---
Two lessons here: don‚Äôt mail lockboxes and if you are a rogue, keep extras on hand of each type.
---
"Take my breath away" plays.
---
OK-- so your proof is your word, and "open your own ticket."
---
Sounds legit.

Missed opportunity for a john Travolta meme
---
Just got a reply from blizzard and the account was restored, the havent given me any idea why it was flagged in the first place, but i replied back and asked so ill let you know if i hear anything else
---
I was in an MC raiding guild with a decently stocked guild bank (high end recipes, MC BOEs, end-game crafting supplies, etc).  I wasn't the GM, but I was an officer in the guild because I was hard working, helpful, knew the game, and generally just didn't start shit with anyone else in the guild.
---
Well, as happens sometimes, drama started within the guild.  Some folks didn't like the direction everything was taking, and there was a lot of arguing and backstabbing, and allegations that people were abusing the guild bank by taking the good stuff and never contributing back.  GM finally had enough, and decided it wasn't worth the effort anymore.  So he started kicking everyone out of the guild, and except for me and one other person that had been with him since the start of the guild.  He then split everything in the guild bank three ways between me, him, and the other guy, just mailing us the gold and supplies.  2-3k gold, easily, all told after auction.  It's important to note that I had zero idea he was going to do any of this, I was just a luck recipient by being loyal the whole time.
---
I felt bad that the other folks kind of got screwed out of everything they'd put in the guild bank...but not bad enough to give away the cash.
---
It always baffles me. It the same when money is wired wrongly to your bank account. How can you not expect that the 500$ will end up being charged back? Nobody in their right mind would go out and party or buy himself a new TV with money that is 100% taken back in 3 days time.
---
Easily avoidable by finding a guild and running dungeons with them.
---
Don't be like OP fellas.
---
Can‚Äôt stunlock a mage
---
I really don't think that is the case. Standard loot rules Need/Greed don't, or rather can't reliably take into account how much you could get from AH/Vendoring/Disenchanting that item. It seems as a default, if not there's really no reason enchanters shouldn't just need on everything.
---
If it was a bag of cash dropping then it would make sense, but as a armor or weapon item it is a bag of cash second, secondary purposes are why the greed button exists.
---
Ofc! I just happen to play horde:P
---
Just got the account back!
---
Best place is the rock bridge leading to Princess in mara. The visuals there is still stunning.
---
Curious, what are the reasons for implosion? Like the whole guild farms mats for guild bank, yet A team gets most benefits? Or more so like A team has all elite players and B team is everyone else. People feel hurt when moved from A to B and stuff like that?
---
The tall cliffs of Azshara.  So beautiful and eerie a the same time.  So much detail in an area with so few quests make it so mysterious.  Even though I am there often it feels forbidden, like I am exploring an abandoned building irl.
---
Oh shit class wars. For some reason.. I like this kind of team work. 
---
It's funny to imagine little class gangs in your raid. "Warriors, come out to play-i-ay."
---
Disagree somewhat on Shammy. They are extremely fun as a lvl 39 twink.
---
The right solution is to play on a server listed as medium pop.... 8k players on at any time. Already 4x more than a full vanilla server... 10k-12k on is just too many
---
And she wants to speak to the Moonager.
---
Or you can just join a guild. Instead of avoiding social interaction in a MMO.
---
Why would you loot council a run if your guild needs pugs looool?
---
DKP and Council can both work or fail. Both have worked and failed in my experience raiding in every tier of every xpac since release.
---
Better question - why would you join a reserved loot or council'd pug run in the first place?
---
If - for some odd reason - you have to pug instead of raiding with your guildies... don't join one that has your BiS on reserve or intends to distribute loot when they can't even get a full raid team together and have to pug you in.
---
And you seem to misunderstand how DKP almost always works... generally at a baseline you get some points for raid attendance and some for each boss kill. Unless you are a guild regularly pugging the exact same players why wouldn't you just do the typical pug thing and have open rolls with MS priority? If you are giving DKP to pug'd players every week so they can save up for what they want to roll on - you know, the entire point of DKP - then why wouldn't you just have them in the guild?
---
Just hit 53 on my warrior - I have been leveling as Arms with no problems tanking dungeons. At what point should I switch to fury, and is there a guide to the best DPS talents? Should I start with a mixed fury/prot to tank dungeons while gearing up?
---
Nice reasoning, but not a thing in the english language. It's a misspelling of "you hear" but I like where you went with that.
---
Infernal in Crossroads 2004, RIP
---
You are making claims, but you are not explaining any of them, I've at least proposed a method of function that could support my claims. You are just throwing claims, acting like an angry child. 
---
Why will this exacerbate the faction imbalance?
---
People are so obsessed with these bis lists haha
---
You're not my supervisor!
---
fells like orcs/trolls would take the longest, but that could just be me
---
Except fishing is very unbalanced towards Horde.  Big Iron Fishing Poles drop right outside a horde town while doing a horde only quest.  The best fishing pole in the game is only available for horde through a horde quest.  All the fish needed for the 300 fishing quest are right by Horde flight paths.  It's kinda ridiculous honestly.

Thunderbluff. Easily the best place to chill out between adventures.
---
As a druid I only buff people when I am in caster form...it's too much work to stop running-dismount-buff-remount and go...also when I'm running around killing mobs in cat form don't expect me to stop and come out just to buff you...such a waste of Mana.. but I haven't had anyone be rude like that...
---
I did encounter a mage last night that buffed me and stood there. I did have to heal so I popped out and buffed and then as I turned to leave they traded me water! You go the extra effort for me..I will go the extra effort for you! 
---
Also sometimes my max buff is too high for your low lvl ass :P
---
Alliance? Sounds about right
---
Doesn't that mean its disadvantageous to roll first? Because if you're the second roller and tie, you get a second chance at winning the item. Two chances as opposed to one? Or is it a 50/50 kind of thing (that would make more sense).
---
In which case, what if the first person rolled a 100 but the second person's 'first' roll was also 100? What then? He default loses? Or if the first person rolls a 1 but the second person also rolls a 1, he default wins?
---
Maybe the second tank? It is a 10 man?
---
Teldrassil. First toon ever was a night elf druid. To this day, the music from the night elf starting areas gets stuck in my head and I develop a deep nostalgia from the days gone.
---
Lots of warriors, rogues, and mages atm. Other classes are just sprinkled in.
---
Edit: and mechanics as in not only moving out for things and dispels but also pulling aggro off the tank. This would be fine if they only killed themselves because they would learn..
---
Yeah, I don't know why OP thinks joining a guild will make it easier to find tanks. I always try the guild first and rarely get a bite.
---
Phoebe is so lucky
---
Yeah, bids are definitely hidden.
---
that odd moment where you have to explain the most basic common sense such as core leather being guild mat...
---
Dear diary, today I died to the opposite faction on a PvP server. It was so profoundly upsetting that I just had to post it on Reddit.
---
Why wouldn't you do blind bids or fixed dkp costs?
---
Incendius? I had a queue time but it's still not listed as a server to have removed layers?
---
Do you use mouseover macros for your heals? If so, you can just mouse over the frames and use those to heal easily. If not, consider it or consider downloading an addon like VuhDo. Click-to-heal addons are more efficient than target + keybinds are no matter how you slice it, but it's not like Classic is hard, either.
---
If you want a little 'tutorial' on how to set up VuhDo send me a PM. I put one together for some other people a few weeks ago!
---
Not yet.

Bayesian vs frequentist statistics in action

Its a Pain, For Totems i usually have Shift 1-5 water, Then Crtl 1-5 Fire , Then use Z,X,C,V,B Air,  Shift Z,X,C,V,B Earth 
---
Is a Complete and Utter Pain in the Ass, But some things i don't have on a keybind. Like Rez water or mounting that sorta thing...  
---
Then my lighting bolt and shocks are 1-6 with my Healing R,T,F,G,H. Then to Top it off i have 2 buttons on my mouse by my thumb i can add and i use those for Rank 1 EarthShock and a Rank 1 Frost Shock. For kicks and Slows. 
---
It works! its Simple (in my EYES) just because i lvl'd up like this so im used to it, But man if i realized that shamans had 20 \*\*\*\*\*\* totems and another 10+ buttons to click on top of that, I would of played a Priest FFS lol. 
---
Regardless man, Nothing is going to make it easy. You gotta figure out what works for you. Cause i use a Reg UI, Click my targets (or tab target) Im good at it, no one can tell the difference.  As you lvl the more familiar you will get with your set up. Just put something up and just Practice with it. It will take a while. Best of luck sir. Not to mention some totems are useless and don't REALLY need a keybind. but it helps
---
Moonglade! Not an easy to place to get to for most classes but as a Druid I have an ability to port myself directly there. The scenery, ambiance and overall feel of the area is so tranquil. It is simply the best place in all of WoW Classic, IMO.
---
Can confirm, opposite faction bad.
---
How do you deal with underperformers or people who flake after signing up?
---
When people were reserving characters they got booted to incorrect realms at that time. For example, my brother and I rolled on Grobbulus but multiple times after waiting in the queue to log in it would boot us to a random different realm instead.
---
If you weren't careful and you weren't double-checking your realm at all stages, it's very possible you've been playing on the wrong realm this entire time. Tons of people didn't notice until days or weeks later when they logged in again to stare at their characters and realized they'd reserved names on the wrong server.

Untested, but should do what you want.  If it's over the character limit you can take out all the "nodead"

Is there a way to make a macro that doesnt cast if you have less than a certian amount of mana? I currently have a druid shifting macro that cancels form and then puts me into cat form but if its possible I would like to make it to where it doesnt cancel form if i dont have enough mana to re cast cat form.

Sounds like the female dwarf rogue version.
---
You should make a video!!
---
"No you're not a bad 'tank.' You're bad period." Aint gonna lie, that was kinda funny.

That new show is amazing and clever too. Living with Yourself is so good.
---
I haven't initiated many duels at 60 because I'm currently prot for gearing up. I am speaking from the journey of lv1-60 on two chars. I would almost never /duel someone 3 levels lower, but would often /duel someone 5+ levels higher. And of course many within 2 levels of myself. Literally 1/10 accept :(  There is more world PVP than I remember in vanilla so maybe that has something to do with it. But I think it more has to do with people being new players or afraid of losing.
---
This.
---
its not much better than mystaria, you can live without it. Also, enlightenment has a 26% chance to drop, will drop again from the first boss. First boss.
---
People do this on OSRS all the time. Then jagex decided to add bonds to OSRS. I'm sure people still do it but not as often as before.
---
I hate when warlocks bitch about not being healed mid-fight because of tapping. Clearly I don't care about your health compared to that of the tank who I am spamming heals on.
---
Westfall, I rolled a gnome warlock in the 2004 Open Beta and going through Westfall before I capped at 20 was a great time and the Deadmines has always been my favorite dungeon.

Probably just uninformed honestly.

Wasn‚Äôt this already posted last night?
---
Definitely poison both unless you have a Shaman (Windfury uses the same buff slot as poison). Windfury only applies to main hand so you can still poison offhand.
---
For damage, Instant Poison is the way to go. I sometimes use crippling (applies a slow) in my offhand for dungeons with humanoids that run away at low HP and might pull other packs, you lose some DPS but the tanks will be much happier.
---
Keep Instant Poison levelled and just use the highest rank you can generally. Don't worry about leveling all your poisons right away, it will cost a lot of money when you should be a little frugal so you can afford your mount at 40 (e.g: I wouldn't worry about Wound/Mind Numbing too much)
---
Proof is in the pudding and I don't see any pudding
---
Nah troll rogues are super chill. 
---
All two of them
---
You do realize it is BIS for a Hunter right? Granted they won‚Äôt be attacking with it but the stats are amazing. Obviously, the melee dos would benefit more from it but it‚Äôs still BIS for them.
---
Can‚Äôt blame them for wanting pre-raid BIS
---
True. Unless there is a distinct metric to determine who is team A and team B. Egos will get in the way.
---
Makes me wonder what mega guilds like invictus and onslaught are going to do on my server. With each of them have 2-4 raid teams
---
My guild had a hunter that did this as he honestly didn't know better (rarity, how awesome it is for rog/war), so he now has the offhand. Pissed the war who was with him right off, but he was following his guide. He never played vanilla, and neither have many people in my guild. Sometimes, people just need a polite education on the matter!
---
It was my first raid with them. It takes, perhaps, five seconds for said OFFICER to say "we use these for the guild."
---
That's...not how Shadowmeld works at all. You seem to think it works like vanish.
---
It doesn't.
---
It can only be activated while out of combat. And you can't move.
---
Nice man! Grats
---
Assumptions. My server is still layered pretty much all day and OG looked worse thsn this on sunday. And there were 100% more layers because guildies were asking for layer inv because they were in the wrong OG. Server crashed when thunder feom ubrs quest buff came.
---
&gt; It accurate predicted the dps of MC as of know. Warrior&gt;rogue&gt;hunter&gt;mage&gt;warlock exactly as pservers had it.
---
Just because the order happens to match does not mean it is actually correct. And don't forget that Classic launched with balance patch 1.13.
---
&gt;What incorrect hit calculation are we talking about?
---
Look if you don't know how Private Servers are different from Classic, at least do a simple Google so you're up to speed.
---
Any pve realm is alliance dominated, the opposite for pvp.  It's just how things go.
---
Was it an Orc Shaman? I had this exact interaction with an Ally Hunter the other night!
---
Why'd you get so defensive? Asked why you rush, and you instantly went to I'm a shit tank, could have just sorry, i'll slow down, remember i said im not a good tank.
---
It gives a bonus to fire spell damage, but its nothing huge.
---
This is the best way I've found to do it also. Macro it so each button/modifiers are only one spot on the action bar.
---
Can you do this in shadow spec?
---
Edit: spelling
---
Can you eli5 me ally warlock lore please?
---
Death Knight to Necromancer is like Paladin to Priest
---
We have not had to deal with that yet as this was the first time we had more than 40. But while we‚Äôre not a hardcore guild forcing consumables and world buffs, we do expect a minimum of knowing the basics of your class and not screwing things up too much. Eventually we will let people know they are in danger of losing their raid spot if a problem perpetuates.
---
Yanno what they say, frostard is the new huntard.
---
You put the tokens you buy on the AH. People buy them and you can trade that gold to other people to buy tokens 
---
In my case I have mass amounts of gold I'm trading to people to buy the token themselves
---
Time is a flat circle
---
That doesn't really address my points. Store items are immersion breaking because the story of your character doesn't address how you obtained them. That's how it feels to me. Furthermore, the 'best' mounts are the ones which are hardest to obtain, and the 'worst' mount is the one that is easiest to obtain. As you say, it's very cheap to buy such mounts - and therefore they are among the 'worst' mounts. You have to do exactly nothing except get your wallet out.
---
Ugh..great logic there
---
Thank you very much. I'll do it when I get there, one dungeon at a time. Was busy rerolling everything so I wouldn't miss out.
---
Oh it was too hilarious to feel bad about it. I just admit it might seem like I am a terrible monster to those allies lol
---
I would roll need with randoms because I don't trust someone to not ninja it. I think that's the most logical way to do it.
---

---
My favorite zone is StrangleThorn Vale. I really enjoy the tropical feeling and also being on edge in such a high PvP area! The quests are fun and close together.
---
We used to play arathi basin with Priest/Druid and go to the alliance starting area and bait players into trying to fight us. They would and then we would stun/mind control, and walk them through the portal out of the PvP zone. They also would get a 10min lockout due to running from the PvP battle.
---
We did this a LOT. No one could ever kill two healers, specifically a resto druid in Burning Crusade, especially with shields. Hilarious stuff but super, super dick.
---
So many good tips in there! Would give you gold if I weren‚Äôt a cheapskate
---
I understand that my evidence is not 100% foolproof, but I  have yet to be presented with evidence that is stronger to support any other conclusion.
---
Seems buggy. I have done trash farm runs before the guild run and it works fine. As long as no boss dies there shouldn‚Äôt be a lock.
---
IMO you can clear everything up till maybe AQ/naxx very easily with 35 in case there's many who can't join. 
---
Yes gear and upgrade stays in the guild but you have 45-50 people sharing loot for 40
---
The auction house. Watching the hustle and bustle of a busy server with a thriving market really stirs my grits.
---
What does my never having been in Org during the seconds when someone turned in Onyxia (including 2006-2009, and 2015-2016) have to do with layering?
---
LOL this is perfect, made me laugh so hard üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

So glad to hear you have this opportunity to connect with him and bond in this situation!

---
Well they did just get invaded by an army of demons, so badly in fact, that it nearly destroyed the world and basically wiped out a large portion of the worlds population...
---
So their reaction to someone who literally summons demons seem natural
---
ugh..seriously...grow up
---
I'm in a small tight guild and get hit up to run with folks I've dungeoned with before because I don't suck and I'm not a dick.
---
 Amen to that
---
Idk it's a long run from bank to AH and there's water everywhere. It's not a particularly convenient city, and IF is literally a circle with most of the useful stuff near the front or center.
---
In a good fight you might be able to take more than 50 hits, so that sounds pretty good.
---
Haha, I agree with that.
---
Mouse over isn't a condition.
---
/cast [@mouseover, exists] Fire Blast(Rank 1); Fire Blast

This should work

I laughed haha

That was a nice read. I like to read the stories like this, it's the one of the reasons I decided to get into classic.  We could never afford a computer when I was younger and when we did get one Warcraft was at its all time Peak as cata was about to release but my mother wouldn't let me play on her computer lol I was only allowed a few games her old boyfriend downloaded. Starcraft and command and conquer. Even though I had my own job. 
---
 Then in 2011 after I bought my house my very first purchase which I eagerly waited to do was a computer. I didn't even buy my own groceries yet. I used old milk cartons and the cardboard from the boxes to set up my computer desk and I played SC2 for the next 6 months with literally nothing else being unpacked in my house hahha (sc2 would not run on my mom's comp). Fast forward a few years and I started playing fps and sorta dropped console all together, then classic was announced and all the memories of my friends talking about it and the stories I read about came back.
---
 Decided to subscribe and play, it's been alot of fun and I just hit 50.  But reading things like this really make me feel like I missed out on a truly remarkable time in gaming, everyone knows exactly what to do and if I have any questions it's a google search away. I will go on for the rest of my life and anytime wow is brought up that's what I'll think lol anybody I've met in classic I never team up with again because my off time of playing. 9-11pm mountain time or 9-2am if I don't work the next day. 
---
 Hope it okay to share this but your post made me really think about it again today lol. Sounds like so many of you really had alot of fun.
---
I thought you're only locked in when you kill a boss
---
It's been slow at work and I've seen it at least 4 times today alone.
---
Big fan of jumper cables, repair bots, and the teleporter.
---
\+5 resistance enchants only
---
This is the correct answer. Early 40s it's much slower going but still totally possible. If the person you're helping happens to be a healer, it's way easier/efficient. You have low health so they can keep you up with ease.
---
Looks like a dude with his arms up I will take that as surrender.
---
Gnomes. Spend two seconds playing one and you‚Äôll notice the difference in scale right away.
---
Because I wanted to
---
I didn‚Äôt really realize the impact of a purple item and I definitely didn‚Äôt know its value, I just saw ‚Äúaxe‚Äù and knew I didn‚Äôt need axe so I immediately hit greed. Luckily it was a run with guild members so everyone agreed to roll greed and no one ninja‚Äôd and I have a learning experience going forward üòÇüòÇ

You need to buy the dust in felwood, you need to do the scholo quest, but you do not need to buy the last 3 items totaling 250g after scholo.

So now you're suggesting I become a guild hopper.

"Why'd you leave your last guild?"
---
"No tanks at my level"
---
"Well we dont have tanks at your level either"

"Reeeeee"
---
\&gt;get known on the server as a guild hopper. Now no "good guilds" will take me

Big brains on you dude!

I've used it twice for quest items I've destroyed that I wasn't aware were for quests I'd already completed and really didn't want to redo them...

I blame LoL, that is what ganking is in the game.

But people conceptualize it as "killing someone using element of surprise".
---
Oh! You're back. With your, "bye," I thought we'd lost your wit from this thread forever.
---
Don't you have mana issues in dungeons as Shadow ? Have to snipe kills for spirit tap can be frustrating :/
---
You are right. I can't. But retail having more players than classic is way more safer assumption than classic having 3-4 times more players than retail. Or that it's dead. Because retail had millions of confirmed players prior to classic release. For the sake of argument let's say 2mill (and even that is underselling imo) just before release. That would mean they think classic got 6-8mill players and there's snowball's chance in hell that's true.
---
It's sounds bad but I think whoever genuinely thinks (like one other person in this thread) retail is dead is a complete moron. Does BfA quality sucks overall? Hell yeah but that doesn't mean it's dead. To give an example - WildStar (may you RIP) is a dead game. Is BfA at the same stage as WS even before they shut it down? I don't think so.
---
His complaint about the price of resources is going the wrong way. 
---
He is worried about not being able to make money off the typical farming spots, which of course is going to happen when people have known about the spots for 15 years.
---
I do think his post touches on 2 things (although he whines about them in the wrong way): The price of trade goods and being able to farm the things you need.
---
The price of trade goods is always going to be linked to supply and demand, as you've pointed out. My issue here is that we've doubled/tripled/quadrupled the population without being able to increase the supply. Take mining for instance. There is a limited amount of thorium in the world (excluding jump runs in DM) that can be mined at a given time. Now that everything is on 1 layer, we have 2√ó/3√ó/4√ó the population fighting for the same amount of nodes. Prices are going to skyrocket from scarcity.
---
And being able to actually farm this stuff is going to become another issue, especially on pvp servers. There are just too many people out there farming the popular spots. If they increase spawns, those people will become richer. There are only so many mobs available.
---
I can't for the life of me pick a Tauren appearance I'm happy with. I wanna make one as an alt, but I keep deleting and making a new one because I don't like the appearance I gave him. I know it's stupid and small but does anyone else get this nitpicky with choosing an appearance?
---
I tank. I love tanking. I don't quite care for tanking pugs, and I really don't mind tanking for guildies but I have limited time and need to work on my alt so I have a reasonable way to farm. I don't need anything either, so it's a poor investment of my time generally speaking.
---
Or let me reserve an orb/unwanted greens/etc. But that tends to go over like a lead balloon.
---
This is noob as hell, but can someone explain the name checks out meme people throw around?
---
How about farming over a couple of weeks and then get the average? Instead of these clickbait videos.
---
That sample size is laughable low.
---
Not a dick, he attacked the horde assuming you‚Äôd back him up just because you happen to be the same faction, and you warned him that they‚Äôd probably leave him alone if he didn‚Äôt mess with them. Not every encounter with the opposite faction has to end in bloodshed. I would of /laughed at him and been on my way. Sounds like the type of person who immediately adds people to ignore as well
---
doesn't this work against your argument? If it's a common drop then healers will see it again

Dun Morogh. It's very relaxing and there is a lot of contrast to the white snow
---
Actually right now fury warriors deem to be parsing with highest dps, but my understanding is that it does take more work to maximize warrior dps.  If you want to raid, mage and rogue are both solid choices as well.  Hunter and warlock are a little more complicated due to pets, and most druids/priests are relegated to healing in raids.
---
Faction is really more preference than anything else - the real difference is have racials more suited for pvp, but raiding goes on in both factions so it really shouldn't make THAT much of a difference.  My understanding is that most pvp servers are horde-heavy and most pve servers are alliance-heavy. I'd roll alliance on a pve server if you're not interested in pvp - more population = more guilds = more chances to get into raiding.
---
Youre the one that contacted me after i said bye lol, go to a psychiatrist man, youre not well lol.
---
Such a horde thing to wipe on Luci..
---
Back in the day, I grinded SM from 30-40. I had a set of shit greens that I would wear every run so I could need on all the greens/ blues that dropped. Then I would vendor/ DE the gear for my personal gain. I still felt guilty his time around so I passed on every roll unless I actually needed the item.
---
I had completely forgotten about Perl, its been a while man hahaha. Thanks.
---
Desolace. No one ever says desolace.
---
Ice mage here- its a small price to pay
---
Alot of alts are mages too, since they're the best farming class. They make great alts for healers and for anyone really
---
So you think you can farm 200 casually in a day or two, but in order to spend 400g it needs to last 10 months?
---
You could just casually farm up 30000 gold instead in those 10 months and buy whatever you could possibly want instead by that logic.
---
You can use character stuck to go to the graveyard and just spirit rez, depending on its location and where you have to travel.
---
Not directly. You may need to buy 2 to do it. Sell it in AH trade the gold. 
---
But you set the price. I use my personal retail gold I've farmed. If you buy 3 wow tokens you can easily trade 2 and set your own price
---
Yea its helped a lot. Obviously it was pretty awkward at first after the merger but both GMs talked and made sure they agreed on most things. And turns out both guilds were already pretty similar in style and just members etc. So lucky enough merger has gone really well. 
---
Next trick is getting the raid groups to get involved together so they don't become there own like separate "clicks" within the guild. Some of the players on team 1 were in the old guild so I know them but I really am mostly close to only people in my raid group now. So hoping we start doing more guild wide events to get to know the other players in different groups better.
---
It's pretty much ninja'ing on a consistent basis. Getting couple whispers a day by random people who accuse your member of being a ninja does not bode well. If the ninja happens in a dungeon or in the open world does not matter at all.

Idk why but after you said E is for earth totems I really wanted you to say F for fire and not R

these items are a 40% drop rate. i don't need a week to figure out the average.

I don't really care that much, I just find it hilarious and childish.
---
Exodar is really awesome. I'll never forget TBC when I made my first Draenei Shaman and went to Exodar. Favorite leveling zone, favorite city. I know they were space goats... but they were MY space goats!
---
Edit: I'm really hoping for TBC Classic, Please Blizzard don't let me down!
---
Awesome I really like that guide, it does more explaining than the other guides I have seen. Thank you!! Sounds like I need to replace some hit with crit
---
This is the best question I've ever seen on this sub.
---
Yea +5 basically translates to 3% hit. If you are sitting at 6% on a human warrior using swords/maces with eye of rend then thats nice (I would probably go for that). There is something to be said for having extra hit if youre dual wielding though, you'd have to sim to see if its better.
---
Except I was in Stormwind for an hour last night when my own guild triggered the head buff at prime time. So objectively I'd know better than you.
---
Agreed. I should make a video of me killing a non elite for an epic and say *if you do this for an hour its 2k g/hr*.
---
Not fun as horde either
---
I keep using halloween candy to be a bigger gnome, then in comes a night elf... Rip my height again
---
Faction shouldn't really matter. A rogue should be easy to pick up. I mean, you buy skills as you level, and you start off slow with just a few. Get the hang of those and add a few more later. So on and so forth. And a rogue is definitely and fun class. 
---
Head on YouTube and watch a couple breakdown videos for the classes you're considering and that should help tons.
---
Can i grab a disc link for the classic warrior discord please!
---
Afaik, no \*base\* stats are on a curve
---
I didn't "ninja" anything. I interacted with the game's mechanics in a natural way. I skinned one hound before I was told to forfeit it, which I did. Who hurt you?
---
Yes.  Enchants don't replace things the items come with.
---
my point was never about healers getting it or not but guild officers being too daft to understand there's really not a whole lot difference between mystaria and enlightenment.   
---
meaning, in the event ragnaros dies and choker drops, you already lost your roll before it even began. and then you have to wait several weeks until most of the raid are decked out in enlightenments AND firelords, then you start competing for firelord again.
---
As a healer I want to agree with you csuse we need to stick together... but at the same time you are being very petty. 
---
I very very rarely finish a pull with the group not all at 80% hp or higher (not counting tank). This may be because my gear is actually very strong now (but am Druid so hots are life).
---
Also it‚Äôs in you for not finding a mage before the dungeon to get the 55 water. I‚Äôm not sure what dungeons you are running, but there are always mages outside of dm. If you are doing strat/scholo get some before you leave. Just cause you don‚Äôt have a mage doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt get 55 water.
---
Lastly join a guild that does guild runs... I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve pugged a dungeon in over a month
---
I waited for a group of 5 people to get formed (~15 mins) to kill Shadra in the Hinterlands. I then waited for them to get Shadra to 25% HP and then I killed their healer and watched the rest of them take durability hits from Shadra, whom I stole the tag for at 4%.
---
Stratholme. The entirety of the instance gives off a dark vibe. There are burning corpses in the streets and the whole place is just teeming with undead ready to be cleansed. Feels so epic.

Okay cool, so 6% then focus crit.

And yeah I‚Äôve heard of people still doing that. I might look into it! I wonder how much of a difference it makes.. I appreciate the input! First time player and it‚Äôs a bit confusing at times :)

A fellow horde once called me gay, I reported it to the GM and mentioned my gay brother served in the army and I was super offended.  I don't have a brother.
---
I dont understand this though.  Realm A = capped.  Realm B = open for business.  
---
You arrive with your guildies to register on a fresh server (WHICH ONLY OPENS IN TWO WEEKS), and you all register on the one thats open for business.
---
I cannot understand why Blizz didnt cap the realms on registration before the game was even released?????????????????????
---
Total screw up............
---

---
mograine is best migraine
---
IMO anything you need roll should become soulbound to you, no matter whether it's BOE or not. Only greed rolls allow it to maintain the tradeable status.  
---
It's annoying how people pretend they can make the phat golds with a level 28 blue BoE. You can't. People level way too fast now for these items to be relevant to the AH, and players are saving money for their mount. Why blow 5g on something you'll upgrade within a few hours again? So these items sit in the AH until they expire, unless you sell them at near vendor value - in which case it's really not worth the effort in the first place.   
---
And people who care about making a few silver from a low level blue so much can rot for all I care. Shitlist me, I don't even wanna know what kind of loot drama  you will kick off over something at level 60.
---
Because there are so many. So they seem to come off as more rude. There are more mages than any other class
---
I always really didn't like Paul Rudd not even sure why. Watched this episode and I can say I Think I was wrong he seems like such a genuinely good dude.
---
You can definitely fault the guy. How about having a brain and some consideration for others instead of blindly following some guide?
---
Rofl .... what does this have to do with Alliance? This exact scenario happens against Horde players as well. Pick a fight, win said fight, they call their guild mates and corpse camp you. Welcome to world pvp.
---
In raids yes... this conversation is about dungeons.
---
charge!
---
For gnomeregan!
---
Well a warrior needing a bow for stats would have been a more parallel comparison, but sure I wouldn't need an item that someone else would get more use out of.  Not sure why this has become a personal attack on hunters.
---
Yes that's true. Thorium is a poor example though because at least on my server the price crashed with DM farming. The real one is devilsaur leather, but as the server population matures there'll be less demand. 
---
Also while my server is full the ore/herb nodes are usually not heavily contested outside the evening. The NEETs can keep the prices down by farming the rest of the day. I also imagine there'll be less people farming when BGs come out.
---
Lol. I love it when people get called out and they get super defensive. Definitely makes me think they are in the right. :D
---
Blackrock Depths for me. Always been my favorite dungeon.
---
I don't like dueling because I have to drink afterwards to get back to what I was doing, so it's just wasting my time, but you're right that it's great practice.  I will probably try to make a point to do some duels once I finally finish leveling.
---
55 runs here according to DBM, 0 savage glad chest, 0 HoJ, 1 naglering, 2 second wind FeelsBadMan
---
Peter D. Would have words friend.
---
I went against the code. 
---
Camped a hunter doing his epic quest in burning steppes all night because I recognized his guild from being camped while leveling.
---
Why double post.
---
I use one button for each totem type and use a Naga mouse. 
---
5 is fire. 
---
7 is earth. 
---
8 is water. 
---
9 is air. 
---
I used mods (nomod/shift/ctrl/alt) so each button can be responsible for 4 different totems. 
---
For some totems I use different keybinds for easier/quicker use. Earthbind, tremor, and grounding totem have their own keybinds. 
---
Then I have a lightning bolt/healing wave and chain lightning/chain heal macro that uses an ability based on if the target is friendly or harmful.
---
It is when you ignore everything other than the numbers when building your raid. 
---
I am a boomkin in my guild, could they get more DPS from another class? Yes, but I put in the time to help people get geared, donate stuff to guild members, farm materials, and show up ready to raid. 
---
In your mentality? I should be dropped for a mage who will be ‚Äúmore efficient‚Äù. That‚Äôs what people are pushing back on. Your drive for efficiency completely ignores all the social aspects of the game, all for the sake of shaving 10 minutes(maybe) off a 2 hour raid that you get to do once per week.
---
Ive been using an MMO mouse since TBC so that helps a lot. Everything bound to the mouse side buttons and use modifiers for different bars (alt, shift, ctrl + mouse buttons).
---
You say youre a clicker though, so I recommend looking into a good totem addon. There are a bunch of diff ones so just find one you like and you'll save yourself a ton of keybindings. I forget which I use (at work atm), but it basically lets me have 4 buttons for the four totem types. These show the cooldown and warn me when they disappear / are destroyed. I can also click a drop down menu on each button to access the other totems of that type. check out curse / twitch for a selection of shaman addons
---
Thousand needles to Shimmering Flats. 
---
Its such a fun map and since I only had the cataclysm version to compare it to I really appreciate that area and I'm so glad I got to experience the real one.
---
Hinterlands, the nostalgia of leveling there back in the day and never having to go back there during later expansions because of how easy lvling had become.
---
Nope, and Taurens are the best horde race.....I will admit some armor looks pretty goofy on us cowfolk though.
---
This is well done. Do you happen to know what the various colors of the item plates are? I thought maybe like crafted vs dungeon drop etc, but lionheart helm is purple backed but devilsaur are yellow backed.
---
Edit: Interesting they came up with this https://sixtyupgrades.com/set/h4WHth5LVCt3LoPugDFsoi for BiS preraid. I had this: https://sixtyupgrades.com/character/iLeEaqx1pjVybt17pMCLQx/set/hJwEXB4TRo2QicH9XGrYi3
---
which has 88 extra AP in exchange for 1.2 crit rate (a trade that sounds good to me). I wonder if that set is better, they've clearly thought about this more than I have.
---
Well I thought the trainer went up to 150
---
Ninjaing has never been a ban able offense in any expansion of wow. Literally google it dude. Not a single person has been banned for taking items on master looter lol. You joined the group, you trusted the leader.

I  can't wait to have that one back, spamming that into a pile of people fighting in BG's was always a blast.

You're a bit late to the party. While views on tanking as a service differ, an absolute requirement to offer it would be knowlege of the dungeons and excellent gear. If you're rocking Quel'serrar with 5 pieces t1 or something like that people might hire you for easy runs, but no one is going to pay an undergeared tank who hasn't done a lot of lvl60 tanking yet.

Imagine how cool itd be to have Darnassus off the coast of Feralis instead of Feathermoon Stronghold.

---
How are they better?  
---
From a stat-stick point of view they give +50 ap and 1% crit.  
---
Peacemake gives +56 ap and 1% crit.  
---
If you're melee weaving (getting a melee attack off in between your autoshots) dual-wielding is plain awful, so Peacemaker is better in that aspect as well.  
---
The only case Dal'Rend set wins out is if the +15 agi enchant is in the game (which isn't until phase 3)
---
Sword of Zeal if you can get it super cheap.  On my server, Zeal was selling for 50g less than Krol so I just bought Krol.
---
No it's just that I'm geared already and I'd rather not farm dungeons I don't need. I'd rather play my alt or farm gold.
---
Elwynn Forrest. Cause I'm basic.

Been farming Dal Rends, at 16 runs and have OH but not seen MH drop. Been reserving and hiring a tank though, shits adding up but Dal Rends set was my main gearing goal in this character and I'm determined to see it through. Absolutely demoralizing though.
---
Just recently I'm bored in Feralas. Someone on /1 is chatting about how these poor alliance noobs have tried and failed the chicken escort quest a bunch of times. A priest and a warlock he says.
---
I'm bored and in a PVP mood so i ask if they are trying again, I get a response that he thinks so but he isn't sure where they are. I did the quest myself a day or two ago so I pick up the trail of dead yeti's and start following it. Pass a group of dead yetis, pass another group of dead yetis, pass a group of dead gorillas and I start to think that I'm too late. Suddenly though at the edge of my vision a group of red text toons appear with their chicken, they are in sight of the end, the pier not too far away. It isn't just a priest and a lock anymore, but a hunter as well, all mid 40s. I'm a level 49 shad priest.
---
I don't hesitate. I open on the lock with a lucky mindblast crit followed by devouring plague and SW:P and shift my attention straight to the hunter.  The warlock clearly isn't much of a fighter as he doesn't even fear me and soon dies to my  DOT's. The hunter puts up a tougher fight but my damage output is superior and he goes down too. The third intended victim (the priest) is staying with the chicken, not even turning around to help his allies! I punish that by catching him just before quest completion and putting him down. I have the satisfaction of watching the chicken despawn as I, badly hurt and totally OOM,  finally die to dots.
---
I've also mind controlled many allies off the boat. My personal record is 4 allies thrown off the boat in a single trip!
---
Soo..  I'm /r/Outoftheloop on what "layering" or "without layering" is.  Can anyone explain?

Yeah I mean I'm not denying he makes bad jokes, but I don't think he's super duper serious with those comments, his humor is just super dry, nerdy and not that great.
---
Game Masters are enforcers of policy.  They could certainly be passing on clarification on an official policy, but for something large like this, the news shouldn't come from a single CS ticket unless they are purposely trying to keep it under the rug (which is now past).
---
Make a post about trolling that isn‚Äôt about trolling so you can troll people. Well played.
---
Stop trolling. I wasnt even talking about my dps meters, was talking about warlocks who use agony to pad out their own, even in raid.
---
There was a big debate over this on my server last night. The guy was charging 20 gold a run, justifying it by explaining it would cover repair costs. 
---
My take on this is the same as reserving loot. As long as you are clear in your intentions before the group starts, and people agree to your price, go ahead.
---
My opinion is get Zeal for the interim but keep farming dal‚Äôrends. Rends is ultimately a better combo with the huge 50 AP bonus. 
---
The reason to get them is your raid swords until phase 3 are vis‚Äôkag and brutality blade, which while unquestionably better are much harder to get. You‚Äôre going to be competing with every other rogue and fury warrior in the group for these items and unless you are guild running with some loot system it‚Äôs gonna be tough - with pugs you just sort of have to get lucky.
---
It's always when ive just spent 15 minutes flying out to a far away zone to farm.
---
Good luck coordinating that when it really doesn‚Äôt matter for clearing content. Until at the EARLIEST BWL you can easily clear the content mostly hammered.
---
Same for me and all my guild, we have like 5 different ID
---
Idk what class you are, but if you can search inside w/o pulling a load of shit, you should see what bosses are dead. Also was this your first since attunement?
---
Exactly. Op would clearly already be benefiting from the runs as much as anyone else in the group. Expecting payment in addition would be unacceptable.
---
If you are doing dungeons below your level/gear then sure, offering to tank for cash might earn you some snarky comments or a shit reputation, but you can do it.
---
&gt; The issue we will run into is people caring more about dps than mechanics
---
Even though vanilla is not as complex as retail, there is still a plethora of things other than raw dps to look at in logs.
---
Debuff uptime, dispels, decurses, dps on trash, threat management, etc.
---
I tell my mages, I don't care if your DPS is 0 for luci/gehennas/shazz, if you top the decurse meter then you're performing better than the idiot with an orange parse and 0 decurses.
---
Or the guy who can't stop cleaving adds on Garr trying to pad his dps to the point that they blow up before the tank has had a chance to get them out of the raid.
---
If your guild leadership only looks at dps logs and nothing else, then they aren't doing their job as well as they could be.

I play on flamelash and have been delayered (which is good) but i had no idea untill i started up the game.  
---
Not a single reference on  the internet, except in game.
---
Honestly any type of fear removal / break / prevention is the core of a successful scholomance run. Most mobs are casters, you don't even need a geared tank.
---
If you need more buttons you can also use your Alt F1-F4 keybinds.
---
as of right now , i‚Äôm at 11% hit , 26% crit , with 809 ap unbuffed. but also running x2 elven rings. and dm trinket. i have boomstick atm , should i go for DM bow ? 360 agility , 145 strength. crusader on both rends . mongoose boots in the process so that‚Äôs another 30 agile with enchant
---
I've made a bunch of money doing this on RS, I guess I'll have to get into the swapping game on WoW:C
---
Feralas rules still, especially since Dire Maul opened up. Ugh, it's such a good zone.
---
And you should make his life a living hell! Killing people for Qs, gathering, quests or even just when passing by is totally OK in my book, but corpse camping just for the lulz of it is just cheap...
---
yea i gank anyone i see. no matter the level. i want a bad rep.
---
bring it.
---
 Winterspring
---
You need a decent amount of time to get an accurate average though. Small sample sizes are far too volatile.
---
Same Issue, Amnennar FR server. Guild : Remember with 3 different IDs
---
But the good thing is people won‚Äôt be abusing layering anymore right?wasn‚Äôt it ruining he market?
---
That's not it mate. I made the raid group with only my guild master and I entered the raid and logged off and he disbanded the group with nothing touched. I logged back in with my ID being locked for no damn reason and my guild master and my guildies are doing an MC run whilst I can't be in.
---
Kind of exploity but theres a way to cheese the skeleton spawns. Get someone who can heal and has either ret aura or thorns to sit at the cave entrance when you start event. The skeles will be invisible to that player and aggro them, killing themselves on reflect dmg. They hit pretty hard so the person just sits there and heals themselves. Pretty cheesy but it works
---
His last post was about getting banned for "allegedly" buying gold. Now a day or two later he presumably has a new account with fat stacks of cash. What a waste of money to just get banned again.
---
What, you don't trust the lvl 1 warrior named some variation of "Notmafia" in trade chat offering mafia free devilsaur gear? :\^)
---
For real though, I agree 100%. I was super close to biting the bullet for my hunter, but then I got T1 hands (2% hit), and some pants from DM:N (1% crit), that only put me a tiny amount of crit and AP behind devilsaur, saving me like 500g on what would have amounted to like &lt; 5 dps.
---
Missed opportunity to have 69 jobs
---
I like this guy.
---
Yay it works.. THANK YOU SO MUCH!
---
If you hit 60 as a druid you will be showered with gear lmfaooo my guild only has one Druid and he‚Äôs fully decked out
---
Agreed mate. Happy grinding!
---
Just migrate or login earlier.
---
Let's not mince words here,  you are in a post I started and still bitching, pissing and moaning about it.  No one is forcing you to be here...and yet here you are.  So obviously butthurt,  keep posting...i love it.
---
I'm the MT for my guild, I always ask guildies to run content before going to the LFG channels. I assume most tanks in active guilds will prioritize groups with friends and guildies before going elsewhere. Hence joining an active guild gives you access to more dedicated tanks
---
I missunderstood what u were meaning, now I get it. You were talking about compensating not being farming, I tought you meant you needed 10 minutes to make water for somebody who asked you about it.
---
We really need another blood plague lol.
---
Right but you are playing on the one of maybe 2 servers that has this problem.
---
druid VERY easy to gear  as a raid of 40 usually has only 2-3 druids.   compared to 4-6 priests.  So you get your class items very quickly
---
I did PvP server first time around. Since I don't wPvP at all, PvE is just a better fit for me. I will be in the BG's however...
---
If you're Horde, go 2h fury for sure. Windfury procs are insane. Alliance 2h fury is good too, but you're more burst damage than you are consistent.
---
cause there's a difference between '' I'm a bad tank... aka, I don't have the appropriate defense/hit gear'' and '' I'm totally clueless on how to pull, I have no concept of how to position mobs and I haven't bound any abilities in defensive stance''.
---
Cause, quite honestly I can heal a dual-wielding warrior in leather gear fine on just about everything minus baron, DM captain and alexi barov ( in 5 man) so gear is rarely the issue....
---
but sometimes, it's as if the warrior somehow lvl to 60 without ever doing an instance on top of being a very slow learner.
---
so what if we are?
---
Turn between warrior and hunter
---
Im a father now, so can maybe play for 2 hours at a time.
---
Warrior is 50 and i feel pretty burned out.
---
Enjoyed tanking a bit and wasnt that bad leveling.
---
I leveled up through dungeons only with friends.
---
Hunter is 15 and i enjoy just logging in, farming for a bit and log off.
---
Main goal is pvp, and will likely not hardcore raid.
---
All friends level 60 now
---
I feel attached to both really.
---
Might just unsub :(
---
Help
---
Isnt layering to reduce lag in zones with the players online. Not to allow unlimited people online.
---
Go to your raid tab and see if you are locked out.
---
Never had problem finding tanks.   Give them an easy/fast run with no wipes and you get a tank on your friend list.    The problem is many players  are self centered and quick to complain and cry and in turn people are quick to put those turds on ignore.   I‚Äôm in the small guild of players  that played together from vanilla retail and we have no problems getting groups rolling.
---
A mechanic gives you a service fee, they don't petition you for tips.
---
If a waiter attempted to remind me to tip I'd give them absolutely nothing.  People who demand a tip don't really deserve at tip.
---
Sylvanas Windrunner does not appreciate you forgetting she was a "ranger". Was actually leader of an entire force of nothing but rangers. Pretty much, they were hunters in a military.
---
It's a bug not the first person to post. Open a ticket
---
Will Montreal is an interesting name yes.
---
.ca too, eh
---
Yeah brez is like my point x2
---
Maximum anal capacity?
---
No other class has bizarre "fantasies" about their class. You dont see melee priests. You dont see ranged warriors. But hunters famously obsess over and steal melee weapons, even ones that are objectively bad for them.
---
i just love it! Queues are nostalgia!
---
I think I've promised 4 different people in my guild the first Atiesh. That'll just be a problem for the future though =)
---
Coordinating it? You mean installing addons? I do agree content is easy enough where you don't strictly need addons atm but why wouldn't you try to do a good job.
---
Any idea how good Druids are in PvP? Group PvP and wPvP?
---
Depends on the temperature.
---
You won't have trouble finding groups as either you'll get way more gear as a druid.
---
Bwl will also be piss easy
---
I was saying from the POV of why people dont become tanks. Not people who are already tanks.
---
Level 15 night elf Hunter here. How do I get my pet to get and hold aggro? Mobs just keep attacking me once I hit them with an arrow and then get within melee range very quickly.
---
I end up having to fight melee most of the time but my arrows do much more damage.
---
Should I get a different pet? I have a moonstalker cat now.
---
3 MC raids, no tier 1
---
There is nothing wrong with "highly encouraged" when writing a guide that has optional components...
---
I would highly encourage you pull the stick out of your ass
---
This is not because of the looks or the music but due to the memories I have here. 
---
Mulgore 
---
The first time I ever logged on was as a Tauren I think during phase 2 or 3 of classic and I just remember my friend finally convincing me to play. He rode decked in some raid gear on his epic mount and walked me through every bit of the game. I was worried about him wasting time showing me how to play WOW but he didn‚Äôt care and just kept on teaching me. Logging back onto classic and see Mulgore again just flooded my mind with those moments and I am thankful to be able to play classic again.
---
i'm human. so ditching dual wield and going for BRE would be a good step to take?
---
I'm not sure when it was, but at some point I just started coming here for this person's art. Thank you!
---
No the behavior is different.  /targetnearestenemy will switch targets to whatever is closest to you, where /startattack will target the first thing it sees, and won't switch targets ever.  It's the same as /targetenemy.  
---
The point of TAB is that when the rogue that's stealthing around you suddenly appears, TAB would grab him regardless of what target you had, provided he was now the closest target.
---
Does this mean I can trade 1g in retail for 1000g in classic from my friend Shang Tsung, and this is okay? As long as I am aware of the risk?
---
Miiight have done this once or twice. Also I kill Alliance if they get in the way of my farms.
---
Still better than Undercity
---
Not sure I follow exactly, but definitely looking into this further :)
---
Thanks for the tip.
---
I think the fact that Shadowfang keep and SM are right near the Undercity helps.
---
2 mobs is fine but it's not something you want to happen intentionally because switching targets fucks up your combo points.
---
Imo you're insane for picking tauren as your race as a hunter
---
Wow i really am lazy, right next to your name üíÄüíÄ lvl 60 yet man?
---
LMFAO you don't know shit about writing, shut up this was well written.
---
The leader is an awful player/person. It takes you 1-2 mins to find another group and it will take them 30-60 mins to find another tank, maybe even worse for scholo.
---
They are exceptions though: I tanked every dungeon aside from stockades and I started every one with "hey, it's been several years since I have been in here without tons of heirlooms, but I have wowhead guide in front of me: please watch your threat, if you pull aggro, run to me, not from me, I will watch healer mana before pulls". No one was against it, and while we still wiped occasionally once per run, it was rather smooth.
---
His new show Living with yourself gives us 2 rudd, we are blessed
---
In raids you tend to have a dead pet constantly so summoning a succubus and sac'ing her for the shadow dmg buff is nice (15%) and since in raids you cant dot - you typically do nothing but sbolt spam.
---
I love when lore discussion reaches the level of "excuse me, but in the officially licensed companion novels..."
---
You partied up to kill the same quest mobs and he left when he finished? This is normal behavior on whitemane server. No hard feelings ever felt.
---
what code prevents you from justly enforcing Guild-KOS?
---
Druids are not dogshit.  If you want to just heal in pvp druid might not be for you because druids are a niche role in pvp.   They don't just follow a warrior around and make sure he doesn't die.  In wsg they're flag carriers in ab and av they sneak around capping shit either alone or with groups.  They have a non standard playstyle in pvp but they're definitely not dogshit.
---
In pve you're "worse" than a priest but it's fine.
---
It‚Äôs because they‚Äôre doing it wrong. You‚Äôre supposed to go grom grol to booty bay, and booty bay to zanzil ruins. 
---
South STV = mithril bound chest:
---
Mageweave, Runecloth, thick/rugged leather, 14 slot bags, 40-49 greens
---
North STV = iron bound chest:
---
Silk, Mageweave, heavy/thick leather, 12 (?) slot bags, lower level greens.
---
serious question, what does the 2nd tank do? taunt for 3 second during conflagrate on drak and.... sit on his thumb for the rest of the instance?
---
Layering was basically multiple versions of each zone on a server... Bit more complex in that it was actually multiple worlds on each server but meh.
---
The joke is that Darn looks the same with and without layering in that no one goes there.
---
Aerie Peak
---
Still dead.
---
I always do this because one day they may do the same. And to prevent ganks telling their ally brotheren that he's cool
---
Also, MMOs were an established genre during the time of WoW's development and had a lot of influence on what classes would be in the game. They would have wanted to compete for all the different types of players to get them to switch from say Everquest to WoW. As such they included many classes not strictly seen in the RTS games, which are far more heavily influenced by tabletop strategy games like Warhammer.
---
It is mostly because Darnassas is up in the NW corner of the map so it takes forever to fly anywhere.
---
Thunder Bluff is much more centrally located and has many quests in there for while you are leveling.
---
When levling you only shift out of cat every 2-3 mobs when you need a heal. If you don't like frequent shifting though definitely don't play a druid, it's pretty much the main reason you would want to play one.
---
The server select screen clearly shows if a server is layered or not. If it doesn't say "Layered", there is no layering and no sharding.
---
.. And THEN get impatient or don‚Äôt understand why you‚Äôre out of mana and need to drink between every pull. Do DPS players just not notice (or care) when they‚Äôre taking just as much damage at the same rate as the tank?
---
You need to use your threat generating attacks more. Obviously you‚Äôre not gonna hold and maintain aggro by doing the most DPS. You need to use shield slam, heroic strike, revenge, taunt, mocking blow, sunders frequently.
---
Your issue is likely your rotation and not your gear. Trust me this was something that took me a long time to realize. I thought I had to focus on DPS because I kept losing aggro. But I wasn‚Äôt using shield slam, heroic strike, or revenge. 
---
I strongly recommend using macros too. I didn‚Äôt do so until last week because I was confused on how it works but it changed everything for me. Much easier to use my abilities.
---
Gold just exchange hands between players, no new gold were added or removed from these exchanges. It will make little difference to the overall economy except maybe slightly more inflation due to higher velocity of money
---
That may be the servers that now have no layering whatsoever.
---
It's possible that some servers like Flamelash, or my home server Incendius, simply have had the number of layers reduced.
---
I had a queue for the first time in weeks last night, but there still seemed to be at least two layers.
---
Why would someone save up so many? Does bag space mean nothing to them?
---
Stop crying about not getting raid gear when you havent even farmed your prebis ranged weapon. 
---
Its a fucking temporary upgrade you will replace with rhok. Its only an upgrade because you cant be bothered to get your best bow pre raid. Yea, no, you dont get rewarded for not farming literally the most important prebis slot for a hunter.
---
Lol I just did then in the order I got the totems
---
To clarify since people are saying it's not BiS (they are correct), it *will* be BiS in the future when the 1H agility enchant gets added.
---
Duskwood! It was the first zone I walked into that felt like it truly transported me to another place. Perfect music and atmosphere, walking the road, lanterns lit until you start finding the broken ones.
---
If it says "Layered" on the server select screen it's layered. If it doesn't, it's not.
---
I made the mistake of rolling alliance skeram. I played a shit ton, got a mage to 42 and farmed up a mount, and then the lowbie-killing raids were in full swing and I quit in a huff. Just the insane ratio I was outnumbered by meant it didn't matter if 90% of people were cool, the 10% that wanted to grief and gank made things beyond miserable.
---
The popularity of this game is incredible. 2 months into the launch of a 15 year old game and we're getting a new server and the other servers are filled to the brim.
---
Do I hope this has an effect on the gaming industry
---
Punching people to death naked, making them miss the boat or get killed by guards and take durability aren't trolling? K bud. 
---
Still not sure why you're so mad. My guess is someone really spanked your ass and you're still butthurt. Vaseline is your friend :D
---
Same but I would also kill the mage at the end :)
---
W A L L of text

Thousand Needles.

The lack of elevation is amazing for questing and it's all just gathering quests in a big ass circle.
---
The only desert map that feels like an actual desert to me.
---
Nobody is gonna pay you for you to gear and level up. At this point(Level 52 with shit gear probably) you're not capable of providing any services at all. In fact, your tanking service is being performed for free by literally every single tank. You can start considering charging for runs once you're geared, level 60 and can provide a smoother and faster run than average due to your gear, your ability as a tank and during hours when tanks are not easy to come by. Outside of that, nobody gonna pay you shit.
---
There isnt really a way around losing aggro and not being able to get it back. This is the fatal flaw in prot paladins. 
---
But. You could always BoP the dmg dealer who has aggro. You can also re-salv people during long encounters if it timed off. You can communicate that you wont be able to fer bwck threat while others are DPSing.
---
You need to train your pet with Growl - https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/training.php
---
Warlock who would hellfire green dragon packs in St as soon as tank went in and would oom me so fast trying to keep him up, and then raged at me when I stopped healing him... Esp since there was no mage in group so all the drinking was costing me $$.
---
Link your source please. The way you say it works seems contradictory to why layers are their in the first place, which is to allow more players on a server at a time, thus reducing que times.
---
What a jerk.
---
I 100% agree it is a dps increase - my issue with NF procs is that I tend to see double crits and go from 10th/11th on threat to pulling threat. Use NF procs carefully lol
---
What is really insane this time around. I ran UBRS over and over and over. The Shadowcraft Tunic never dropped. I ran it twice this time around and it dropped twice. I ran Scholo twice and got all of the Cadaverous set except the glove. The second run, I got the gloves. I guess this is my reward for the Vanilla punishing me the first time around. LOL
---
I've been in STV as a lvl 38 human warrior and its the fucking Thuderdome. Most of the time its ppl 10+ being dicks but also a fair amount similarly leveled folks just out for blood.
---
Just curious, what's your usual going rate?
---
Here is the chart
---
&gt;If the target is +1 level compared to caster: 95%  
---
&gt;If the target is +2 levels compared to caster: 94%  
---
&gt;If the target is +3 levels compared to caster: 83% if the target is a monster, 87% if the target is a player.  
---
&gt;If the target is +4 levels compared to caster: 72% if the target is a monster, 80% if the target is a player.  
---
&gt;If the target is +5 levels compared to caster: 61% if the target is a monster, 73% if the target is a player.
---
and you can assume that the boss targets are over 63-68 (  [https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Boss](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Boss) )
---
But as you can see even at 60 people get hit by this, it just gets a bit worse the further you are from 60.
---
It's a chat parser. All it does is organize chat spam so it's easier to find groups. There is no less social interaction when you use the addon vs not using it.
---
This. At level 36 on my rogue, I sometimes even have a hard time keeping a mob around long enough to hit them with a 5 combo point eviscerate anyway.
---
Just a heads up, druids in cat form and rogues take reduced falling damage. I have survived this trick a dozen times so far in classic. Nice try priests!
---
"cant be bothered" lol retard
---
Tanking is easy.
---
If your guild thinks its OK for a hunter to take dal rends over a rogue you should run as fast as you fucking can.
---
But they have ALREADY been outnumbered in such a way that it should be theoretically impossible to get quests done. This does not change that.
---
Grats have fun
---
Once you are 60, get a bit of gear and experience (people will expect you to lead the run as in give warnings which packs you LOS, set marks, actually choose which packs to pull or avoid etc.) you will be able to reserve items on your runs or some sellables like 1st orb in strat live or BOE greens from the run. If you are undergeared, people won't appreciate that.
---
Yea I get it for sure I just read the first part and was like oh that‚Äôs a good way to align... oh wait nevermind.
---
The zone is just beautiful.
---
Just adding my two cents; I feel like tanks have the right to ask for reservations when asked to tank an instance that you may not have any drops for. 
---
Example; reserving the thorium veins at the end of a DM: E run to allow others to get their gear and you can still get something profitable as well.
---
Wow that's awesome!
---
How do read
---
breakup with her\*
---
I gank in Hillsbarad whenever I go to train tailoring because I spent 3 days there in my youth getting ganked.
---
I don‚Äôt understand how folks can just pass through or never visit Darnassus. It‚Äôs a beautiful, vibrant place and the ambient music is absolutely phenomenal. I understand people want to be with people and group in the most crowded place, I just wish Darnassus got the love it deserves.
---
Damn bro ----- The internet is brutal. I was just curious and people puffing profanity my way. Feels bad QQ
---
Also note:
---
Most any humanoid mob with ‚Äúguardsman‚Äù in their names or wielding a shield will often randomly interrupt a nearby caster.
---
That's a good question actually. I doubt I even had 20 of them drop in all my time in classic. Maybe he bought them off people? idk
---
Holy shock is a waste.  The only time you use it when youre moving as a healer, which is nit that common
---
Mmm bueno
---
Ugh. This actually makes it worse for me.  I love healing but have little time to play. I think I'll go prot but keep a healing set so I can fill both.  Works well enough for my druid and shaman and you're right. Tanking in holy sounds rough
---
why bother vendoring your gear when you can just cancel subscription and be done with it
---
Its cause yall summon demons...its the devils!
---
The Mystical Land of Azshara.
---
No, the idea that a single person should get exclusive rolls on an item that has value to everyone is "making your own rules on the hierarchy of need vs greed." This thought process forgoes the best interest of the group to satisfy the greed of a single player. But you're right if you state the rules ahead of time there's no issue. So don't get mad if someone needs a BoE item unless you stated previously its reserved.
---
It takes a while to get to 60 from 52 man. You‚Äôre thinking too far ahead. Just get to 60 first. At that point you have to run LBRS, UBRS for gear and pre-BIS. It‚Äôll take a minute before you start charging to tank.
---
I don‚Äôt blame this dude honestly and I‚Äôm surprised by the comments here. I get asked to tank occasionally on my Druid, even though I have very little experience tanking and don‚Äôt really know what I‚Äôm doing. So I‚Äôll always tell them ‚Äúsure, but I‚Äôm probably going to be bad.‚Äù If a group accepts you with a warning that you‚Äôre not a great tank and then starts talking shit about your tanking after you already told them you‚Äôre not good at it/not confident tanking/whatever else, fuck yourselves.
---
I've never seen even one pattern yet.
---
you got a pretty good deal on that. $15 for 200g is way above normal rates
---
Aww yessss that actually put a smile to my face, I was worried if hes passed or something!
---
&gt; It's pretty well established that even medium-sized realms are far larger than even the biggest realms in Vanilla.
---
source? I'm in one of the higher populated realms and it has less people than I remember seeing in Vanilla.
---
* Logitech G600: 12 side buttons + 4 top buttons + G-shift = 32 buttons.  
---
* Keyboard has 3 modifiers (CRTL, ALT, Shift)  
---
* 3 * 32 = 96 buttons.  
---
Then you have additional buttons on the keyboard, each with the 3 modifiers. So a total of at least 130 keybinds if you only count the most easily reachable keys.
---
That's way more than enough for me.
---
It's all the red meat.
---
The current theory is that this is happening because layering is in the process of being removed right now - which seems probable as servers that haven't had a queue since the first week of launch now have queues.   
---
    
---
It makes sense for available resources to be increased via the lowering of spawn cooldowns due to the overwhelming server sizes.  
---
I'm personally hoping that herbs get included in that deal, as it's been super dry out there for a long time.
---
I basically only do rotten things in this game but one fond memory from vanilla was getting into Hyjal as a warlock with two buddies, swimming down the water tunnel under the world tree with underwater breathing so far down that you couldn't reach the surface before drowning, /who-ing low levels and randomly summoning them. Those that accepted would drown, their ghost would spawn in Felwood because Hyjal had no actual graveyard and they'd need to spirit rez in a high level zone.
---
I have only went once and that was the time I went in. There was none besides me and my guild master. I have contacted a game master and what they basically told me is '' I am not the first one to do that mistake and I would have to wait till next reset'' and another one was '' They can't fix it tonight'' so I guess it's a known issue where people can be locked out just for logging off inside a raid.
---
Guards don't like the class that sells their souls for power and summons demons from the twisting nether?? Crazy.
---
Just buy them. Got two for 30g each, took me 15 minutes.
---
I didn't see a thread for what should I play pinned today so I guess I'll post here. 
---
I started playing and currently on a lvl 31 lock. I basically wanna PvP with warlock and tank with warrior. So I plan on leveling both eventually. 
---
My question is if I'm doing it in the right order. I wanted to go warlock first to 60 to supply my ult with mount money and gear to make things easier. But now I'm worried I won't start my warrior til phase 2 when world pvp is out and my warr will get rekt solo lvling in open PvP. 
---
What do?
---
Barrens Pog
---
&gt;Why'd you get so defensive? Asked why you rush
---
And how old I am.
---
If the player characters are 10 levels difference or the lowbies to the mob level difference?
---
As a dps, stop topping me off when I'm at 90% while pulling trash. I'm not eating/bandaging because I don't need to, just like I don't drink after every pull if I have 70% mana left. I get just as frustrated as you do about the wasted mana.
---
sell everything in your bag and what you wear and you probably get 11-12 copper per char, which you can send to a bankchar and probably make 1-2g  in 10k runs.
---
Just turn the volume on dude
---
If you were able to remove frost nova from yourself every 1 minute (which, given the natural ebb and flow of fighting in BGs/wPVP, is almost once per fight) would you not take it? 
---
And would you not laugh at the people who, despite claiming to be "pvp focused", chose NOT to take it?
---
Karazhan Crypts, how was this never used!?
---
Also blasted lands, what an epic experience to start an expansion.
---
The true market value is exact the same regardless. Its just less on the BOP because you only have one person at a fix price you can sell to.
---
If anything, Like i said in the other post a 10G item with a 1g vendor price... based off this "money not spent is value" argument would mean that the item has 11g worth of value to someone who would wear it (10g of saved cost and 1g of residual) verses the 10g to someone who would sell it.
---
Like job applications. They all want you to have experience but how do you get the experience if no one let's you.
---
Unexpected office
---
Ok, boomer
---
&gt;Mages are only appreciated when your not in a group with them. The moment you group up with a mage, you need to start babysitting, telling them not to start doing big dick AoE the nanosecond the warrior pulls a pack (or better yet, doing the pulls themselves) and then bitching about the useless tank not holding aggro, and explaining to them that Blizzard and Arcane Explosion spam is not an efficient way to DPS down two mobs.
---
As someone who only has the bracers I def suggest them, those things are awesome when paired with stuff like true faith.
---
Shit, I just realized how empty our server is.
---
Sure did.
---
I dont want to buy anything until I have my mount tbh

There‚Äôs nothing wrong with knowing your bis, everyone should.  But to pass on an item that‚Äôs an upgrade but not bis is crazy.  As a guild you need to decide what‚Äôs best and if it‚Äôs open roll, roll if it‚Äôs an upgrade.  It‚Äôs just not realistic to think everyone is going to get every bis item they need at this point in the game.  So getting an upgrade now will be much more beneficial then waiting months for that true bis item.  That‚Äôs my 2cents.
---
Booooo!
---
Because not everyone is going to sign up at the exact same time so people will get split up.

My source for what?  That layers are limited number?  That seems self-evident, but ion elaborates here:
---
https://www.forbes.com/sites/hnewman/2019/08/26/warcraft-classic-layering-and-realm-queues-ion-hazzikostas-explains-why-youre-waiting-to-log-in/#13c4d88a7e45
---
Here he says that layers are the equivalent to a typical full vanilla server.  
---
The layers existed to account for high initial volume of players and the expected player dropoff over the next few months.  Basically a way of having playable over-populated launch servers, so that the servers would be healthy with one layer after a few months.  This is also explained in the dev ama in this sub a couple months ago, you can look that up too if you want more detail than the forbes article.
---
But if you believe layers helped with the queues (as they did), then why do you find it so hard to believe that reducing the number of layers with no corresponding player reduction would not bring queues back?  As it is, you have the same amount of people attempting to access the game, but less available slots for players to log into.  How would that not result in queues until the demand went back down?  Shouldn't need to source that claim, it seems something you would take for granted.

My husband had been furiously trying to get me back into gaming since we started dating.  The only thing that held my interest was Skyrim, but my system was garbage so it took a lot of the enjoyment out of it.  Along came Classic.  I was excited.  He was excited.  Needless to say, he is no longer excited and regrets his decisions.
---
Before your first raid. 5 mans are actually better in arms, especially if you are tanking it with 1h and shield.
---
Redridge mountains. I dont know why, it just feels cozy and like home.
---
Did my satire not translate well?
---
Yeah this. I put together a group last night for BRD. Level 53 mage and lock, 55 priest, 56 rogue, and me a 58 warrior. I ran in and unlocked the doors and since they were behind me I pulled a pack because I had done it about 50 times, arena/anger quick runs. But the priest, mage and lock were drinking and buffing and didn‚Äôt bother following, so I pulled the mobs out a bit to them, wondering if they were going to join in. They didn‚Äôt, and I died, then they died. So they asked why I rushed in that door and I said it was a normal arena route, but said I would slow down. Turns out they were just kind of toxic, the mage and lock were going at each other the entire two runs we did.
---
Damn, that's dirty.

Seems pretty good to me.
---
I'll check that out for sure.  I just read it's 60 threat/player, and it's modified by RF so that should bring it up to 114/player. 
---
Something I've also realized that I guess I forgot about was that JoL generates threat by merit of healing.  I just read something saying it's 0.25/point, so that may come in handy as well.  I usually use JoW since I burn through mana so fast, but I'll start making the switch and see what's up with it.

If I forget to message you about this, hit me up and I'll let you know how it goes.

First half of your post had me thinking you were for real and I was about to blast you. üò¨

Rough man, I hate the groups that never wait for sunders.
---
Had a hunter join an UBRS group the other day, and as he arrived in the instance (but not to us yet) a Dwarvish Hand Cannon dropped just past the whelps. Everyone rolls need except for him, who wasn't close enough to participate.
---
Almost immediately he starts with "Can I have it? Can I have it? It's my BiS. Wtf guys I need it! Why won't you give it to me?! Clearly you guys don't know how NEED vs GREED works!" etc etc. Some people say he can have it for 200g, he complains, but eventually shuts up. Occasionally he pipes up asking for it again but we just ignore him.
---
As it turns out that's not what made him truly bad. After jumping to Rend I notice he doesn't call his pet back. I bring it up. Silence. Get to The Beast. No pet. Last boss? No pet. It turned out this huntard didn't even *have* a fucking pet. He was 58, and didn't have a pet. I brought up how a pet would add more damage than the gun before the group disbanded, and we all went our own ways again.
---
You had us in the first half. 
---
Personally, my lady plays Warcraft (she SUX) but it‚Äôs great that she does. She started with BOTW, as I felt that was a good intro to gaming, then right into wow an surprisingly she does DECENT. I‚Äôm glad that chick you dated got what she wanted but sheesh. She a pleb. You‚Äôd pwn her new man anyway. Your a god. Shit on her man with your holy shit. Squat over her in your armor, and just pwn. Ggz.
---
It's a common thing to get the guild bank started. Once they start running MC it usually stops.
---
Now that's just uncalled for.
---
You asked ‚ÄúWho would want to pad someone else‚Äôs meters‚Äù. I answered that question. 
---
You are talking out both sides of your mouth.
---
I‚Äôm not arguing it‚Äôs far better for PvP but he didn‚Äôt indicate that he is only interested in PvP. It‚Äôs pretty clear since he is talking about Rag loot that pve is quite important as well. 
---
People can be multi-focused.
---
Of corse, I pay 1g for ports.  But we can‚Äôt hide the fact that some mages are stingy and just don‚Äôt want to click on a button to help someone out, and make a little money. 
---
Fuck the people who don‚Äôt tip. But, don‚Äôt hate on the guy trying to give you 50s for a port or some free water. 
---
(I mean do what you want in the end but, just know you make some of us cry when buying water.)
---
An enhancement shaman with the cold ridge dagger using windfury on his weapon doing less damage in ZF than our holy priest healer. 
---
When asked to change to flame tongue, he insisted that windfury was more dps.
---
Undercity gets traffic as it is near as it's both by a fair amount of level 60 content in itself as well as easily connected to the Orgrimmar. On Horde UC is actually my preferred city, both due to layout but also location. Thunderbluff isn't near level 60 content and isn't as connected, but it's at least in the center of the continent so if you're in Kalimdor it isn't that far away from anything.
---
Darnasses isn't connected to anything, nor is it close to anything. Darnassus being the only city in Kalimdor should mean it gets more traffic as all the people doing stuff in Kalimdor would go there, except it's so freaking out of the way. For a large portion of Kalimdor it's either the same speed or actually slower to get to Darnassus that Ironforge. That includes all the level 60 group content. If you want to raid Onyxia's Lair or AQ, it is faster to come from Ironforge than Darnassus.
---
What's with all the attention whore/karma famring "I quit wow because its addictive and bad for you and now I can have a real life" posts lately?
---
we split the raid in half, recruited like mad, and pugged a little bit. worked great
---
I've stopped using mouseover macros for this reason (not to mention sometimes my mouse would be over the wrong target if I were tab healing causing me to mini-panic).  Occassionally the buttons with macros would bug out and not let me select it.
---
The shadowform issue is acting pretty much the same exact way, except I don't have a macro for it which is why I'm confused as to the cause.
---
And yes, it had to be a portal/hearth/summon: IT TOOK THE ZEPPELIN WITH ME TO UNDERCITY.
---
Horde will do 2H fury due to windfury procs  
---
Ally can do 2H fury but it's not the same without the windfury and typically tend to go DW Fury cause of the mace/sword benefits humans give and things like ironfoe.
---
I definitely won't be going ret but I'm okay with carrying multiple sets. Do it on my druid already.  I appreciate the response.  Think I'll go 11 holy,  rest in prot, and carrying both sets
---
Why not stick with the warlock for a while? PVP, easy farm Mara, great dps in PvE.
---
Warrior leveling in general will be a bit of a pain. If your worried about getting destroyed, you can join melee cleave dungeon groups on horde.
---
Then don't sell water, 1g = 6 stacks if you don't want the free gold i'll move on. I go through 4 stacks like its nothing.
---
There‚Äôs like 3 streamer guilds
---
I was betrayed so hard yesterday that all alli are KoS until further notice.
---
I was waiting for help to kill something, but a stronger lock came up and pointed as if he wanted help. So I decided to let him get first tag and maybe he‚Äôd hang around to help me out. We‚Äôre like 3/4ths through killing this thing and some dick comes in and starts attacking the hell outta me. So my ‚Äútrusted‚Äù lock comes in and starts beating on me too.
---
I rez and they wail on me once more before leaving. Such a foul move I was heartbroken
---
Ah so the one assuming everyone plays with game sound only, or that maybe the other person had IRL stuff distracting them, or any number of valid reasons.

It's a rhetorical question, jesus christ why are people so ignorant these days? That's rhetorical too, btw.

Looking for a Titan plugin to change/display my "Find Herbs/Treasure/whatever," to get all of my minimap icons moved to my Titan panel.

Winterspring. I love the snowy aesthetic and it's where i first dinged 60 back in retail. Also has the coolest hunter pets in my opinion!
---
Sure, but most people choose efficiency over fun or cool-looking every time.
---
Don't worry, as a Warrior you will get rekt while leveling in both Phase 1 and Phase 2
---
Turn off the WoW music and inject the EDM straight into your eyes for maximum MLG.
---
Um, I dunno what you‚Äôve been smoking but I have made no edits.
---
Attempted to run LBRS last night.  The tank is harassing people before we even all arrive.  We get into the entry room and the harassment continues for no reason.  I am the healer, I notice straight away that our "tank" is a 2H warrior wearing half leather.  I keep spamming heals and things go okay in room 1.  We drop down, I drop totems and drink.  Warrior runs into the mob and dies in less than 1 second while I am drinking (which I stop and start casting on him, but there isn't enough time for even a single heal to go off).  We wipe.  The warrior leaves immediately and starts spamming in LFG to start a new run.  Good luck with that.
---
I joined a different group and the dungeon went super smooth.  The tank died once when he went off on his own while the rest of us farmed spider eggs for a quest.  Even then, the Boomkin battle rez'd him back and there was no time lost.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong as I've played minimal horde, but the fang set is high agility isn't it? I was under the impression it's widely accepted for rogues to roll need on it. Plus, it's a low level set. Anyone who gets truly upset over that isn't someone you'd want to play with anyway IMO.
---
Because they just asked why are you going to fast, basically like saying slow down, and the response is I'm a shit tank remember. Take the criticism, and slow it down.
---
I actually regret having a girlfriend because I‚Äôm way behind the gear curve.
---
Is it now?
---
the problem is the game has no systems in place to make running dungeons attractive to geared tanks.
---
and tanks always get funneled gear from MC, removing their desire to tank dungeons
---
the badge system from TBC and WOTLK was a good thing.
---
We wouldn't want to overheat the sun now would we?
---
Ironforge. So alive!
---
Gives me something to do w/ the 1mil+ retail gold I have on dragonmaw that I will never touch and try to get some Whitemane gold haha
---
Yeah, they both were dicks to each other.
---
That sounds like a good first run, and spot on with tanking. You take the hits, so the healer and DPS can do their thing. As you progress the bosses will have more interesting (and challenging) mechanics, but you seem well on your way!
---
"How old are you?"
---
"42"
---
Haha I bet he's still pretty excited! I could never get my ex to game, but I didnt mind. she had her hobbies and I had mine
---
How long does it take for night elves to get to ironforge? and can you do it without dying?
---
Garotte does decent damage though, similar to ambush.  Just needs time to tick.  You are getting a lot of damage per energy.
---
But it sounds like SS may be the answer here, i.e. energy spend on SS gives you more damage vs other options.
---
Tokens don't add money to the economy. You buy the token and sell it on the ah for a fixed price. Some other player buys it.
---
Wowhead combat daggers is definitely the way to go for pve until your gear is much better. 31/15/5 is a good bit worse in pve, but much better in pvp, and heavy sub builds are even more pvp oriented.
---
Lore-wise, warlocks (and shadow priests) are pretty much all power-hungry assholes. It really doesn't make sense that you can play them without getting strongly negative reactions from everyone else.
---
40 people are literally stronger than 1 person. What again about math and statistics?
---
Watched the first episode last night - very good!
---
Mankrik represent!!
---
I hate you.
---
Grats!
---
This hits too close to home
---
Might be just three gold if I remember right. Just bought mine at level 52.
---
Doesn‚Äôt seem like a big deal either way tbh just a few extra seconds of drinking/healing.
---
&gt;Sounds like the addon is doing a good job, not me. 
---
Get out of your ignorant little bubble lol, healing is the role most dependent on addons. Always has been, always will be.
---
Or just open a ticket and get the person banned.
---
30 is when you get the quest for it. If you can find someone to carry you through it you can get it then. 36 you can solo everything but the elite at the end.
---
I definitely feel the negative connotation of "LF2M DPS X is reserved" vs "LF2M Caster DPS", but the former allows you to actually invite people that still need *some* loot (but not *your* loot), whereas the latter completely isolates a large portion of the population from even being let into the dungeon in the first place.
---
I tend to just search for casters in my groups to avoid all the headaches, but that's because I know my tank and know what he does and doesn't have. I also know that if we compete on loot, we'll be back to get the other person his. But if I didn't know him, and I needed a tank, I'd really have no other choice than to reserve the loot, and as evident by this thread, people don't like that.
---
It was shrinkage!
---
Eastern plaguelands
---
Or that isn‚Äôt filled with members concerned with their own personal progress.
---
That's my sole goal too, to ding 60, but not the "and quit" part though lol.
---
Nothing like the initial rush ride though is there, it's something and so glad i didn't miss it, my gawd what a wave.
---
I'm in a great groove with the game atm like many, many others, not playing to much, not playing too little, playing it just right, rolled a bunch of alts, so that dinging 60 is a ways off. Jumped back into swg:legends too, nice to have them both running again after the 100% classic takeover lmao :)
---
I get the ding 60 and walk away too though.
---
Main thing you didn't miss the ride of a mmorpg player lifetime, if  you missed it, it's now gone forever. I totally get people only now coming to the game a couple months later, that's cool and smart to wait for the dust to settle, i get why they waited but... OMFG did they ever miss the main attraction.
---
ehhhh you would have to be pretty specific as to what blue BoEs would be considered 'more valuable'. i am not referring to twink gear. Other than twink gear, I have no idea what blues sell for hundreds of gold. Plate boots that is a blue BoE and is a preraid bis for warriors sell for...60-75g or so on my server. Meanwhile, a wardens staff is 250, Flurry axe is 290, Axe of the deep woods is 350, list goes on. Excluding crafted blues, I can't really think of any that sell for a high amount (as high/higher than an epic in the same slot)
---
Went to ST when I was lvl 52 or 53. I was specced shadow at the time. The dragon mobs hit hard so I went in as a dps. The group found a lvl 55 priest healer. On some of the mob pulls, he was doing dps instead of healing and always linked the dps meter when his dps was high....that's fine, until we are at the last boss. The tank died seconds after pulling. I turned around and saw the priest mind blasting the dragon instead of spamming heals on the tank. 
---
We wiped, obviously. The priest left the group immediately without saying anything.
---
Then when I was around lvl 56 or 57, joined a BRD run as a dps farming arena. The group invited the same priest to heal. We took the shortcut and jumped down to arena, waiting for the tank to arrive. Tank asked for help outside the instance because he was being ganked by opposing factions. We decide to run out to help him and of course, we try to avoid running passed the middle so that we don't start the arena. As the priest ran out with us, he ran straight past the middle and started the arena.
---
Isn‚Äôt damage the easiest role? You straight up just dump your rotation for single/multi target.
---
No ones cares.
---
What's with all the asshole self entitled comments lately? Didn't know people people cared so much about how other people live their lives to actually complain about them doing so.
---
I need more ways to cause mischief! Prowl is awesome but goose form would be even better
---
I don't think wow is bad for you. I had a great journey, and altogether i played the shit out of both classic and TBC, as well as Elysium (the successor to Nostalrius). I am a true Classic fan, and I love the game. I also have 400 days /played altogether. And I wouldn't change a thing!
---
No problem.
---
As melee, you don't need to worry about elemental damage types. They're intended for casters who will heavily specialize in a particular element (Frost Mage, Fire Mage, Druid (Nature), etc). You can just worry about your melee stats (agi/str/ap/crit/hit/etc) and your defenses. In the higher levels, you may see elemental resistance armor (e.g: fire resist armor, nature resist armor, frost resist armor). These are nice to have for later content (Nature Resist gear for Ahn'Qiraj for example).
---
Only the poison itself would benefit from the boost, so it would be a miniscule boost. Poisons don't convert your other attacks to nature damage.
---
General rogue stat prio is hit chance &gt; agi / crit (agi gives crit so it's usually stronger) &gt; attack power / strength (strength gives attack power)
---
Attack Power is quite good for us so sometimes if you have two comparable pieces, you might need to figure out how much AP the item gives (based on the agi/strength/ap on the item). Sometimes an item with pure AP might be better, othertimes an item with agi/str might be better because you're getting more AP from the stats anyways
---
But the cats don't learn this skill until level 40, and they have to pay. Keep targeting the low level cats!

---
Never really dug into scaling for hunters, but if you depend on stats the way they (and certain other classes, druids for example) do you start higher, but drop off pretty precipitously. 
---
Wars as expected, keep getting better with gear, and rogues aren't doing badly either, with mages dominating on Rag (expected) but damn that Max is insane.
---
Literally at the entrance of your first raid. There's no good reason to switch before hand.
---
I‚Äôm leaning towards ‚ÄúB‚Äù as my ‚Äúideal‚Äù build
---
My favorite part of priest healing is mana management, and I prefer the ‚Äúset in stone‚Äù 5-second rule over tracking MP5 gear in and out of 5-sec regen. (timing heals to get an extra mana regen tick 0.1-0.2 seconds before spellcast, especially since MP5 from gear doesn‚Äôt seem to work/track with regen addons)
---
IE My leveling friend (tank) and I have got a really good grasp of my spirit regen when it comes to dungeon pacing, and we both don‚Äôt care too much about hardcore raiding. We probably won‚Äôt ding 60 for another 2-3 weeks though, which means T2 gear is quite far away anyway... so I suppose I have plenty of time to figure out what gear is avaliable when I do start raiding.
---
He's just an asshole, he did you a favor by letting you know this as fast as possible.
---
Skeram was officially noted as being one layer yetserday. I witnessed the same insane volume of people over a week ago that wasn't even on Tuesday, that's all I am saying.
---
&gt;Is there a specific reason why Fury Twohand for Raid... not Arms?
---
Why is there a what?
---
Thank you, I adjusted the colors a couple times. I‚Äôm glad you like it!
---
Source?
---
That is the way groups should function, greed for gold need for equip upgrade. However because people think needing gold means they should need on anything they can sell they need it as well. If we follow that logic through why dont we just roll need on everything? We all need gold all the time. 
---
That said, I always wait for the group to see their approach. That way I dont need when they greed or vice versus. 
---
With this approach if someone needs as an upgrade they are SoL with this process of all roll need. It is what it is. Each group is different in particular with PuGs.
---
May I ask why that is... ?
---
Get your friends
---
Yes put a raid nearby so I can sell portals to darn
---
Ignore those people they will never do anything properly. The mage seems like he was trying to help, the druid just seems like a douchecanoe. 
---
tanking is honestly one of the easiest roles to get into, easier than dpsing (yes i said it), but it can become the hardest with bad groups. When you start you will struggle with cd's. But all you're honestly doing is grabbing packs and gathering aggro, you dont need to do massive damage, just keep them on you. 
---
The reason I say dps is harder is because they need to sit back and wait, know what to cc, and follow the kill order, most of the people can't do the simplest of tasks. Which makes your job as a tank and healers job harder.
---
it's classic wow - if you don't participate in PVE you are almost guaranteed to be so poorly geared that you won't even scratch the surface of PVP.
---
Tanaris, 
---
The expansive desert is just thematically awesome!
---
Hi. You're the problem!
---
Carries are real and work great. Get a 60 mage and win.
---
Twinking is living.
---
I would just not heal them.
---
idk whose saying this is a popular opinion, because i had 25 msgs on here the other day when i logged in after i agreed with someone that basically said people who roll need on boes that can actually go to someone in the group are: ninjas. (they are)
---
my perspective is, gear &gt; money. yet i had countless ppl (25 msgs were just the ones that built up) that disagree'd. in there mind, its only fair that they have a chance at the supposed jackpot because they participated in the fight. yet if you were to roll need on some BoP gear to vendor that someone actually needed (because we all need money appernetly) its considered to be bad because "its different, boe vs bop is different" (spoilers, its not any different).
---
the majority of players see it as money &gt; gear.
---
I do! My name in game is actually Sw√°ns. Are you on Fairbanks?
---
That's why on raid nights we start from thorium point as a 40-man raid and kill all hordes on sight
---
Well a massacre implies there's many to kill, but I have a pretty decent feeling that those horde are gonna be kill starved. I certainly wouldn't login to literally constant death patrols. I remember what levelling on Stallag was like before my group transfered, I can't imagine p2 on a horde server...
---
Night Elves are fucking huge lol.
---
Everytime I‚Äôm just standing around and end up next to a night elf it shocks me.
---
Oh :(
---
People who don't game don't usually understand it, but nearly everyone understands TV and a lot people say their vices are less "vicefull" than other vices that they do not understand imo.
---
Hey, I played feral back in the day and can answer your questions.  Basically, a tank's primary purpose is to absorb or mitigate as much damage as possible done to the group.  This is usually done by holding threat on mobs so they only target you.  Different classes have different ways of generating threat, for a druid the best way is with dealing damage, as well as getting the talent for +15% threat in bear form.  Part of being a good tank is knowing that you have several ways of reducing damage being taken by the group.  For instance druids can get feral charge to root a mob or even interrupt their spell casting, which would reduce that mobs outgoing damage by 100% for a short duration.  But so long as you keep the mobs on you as much as you can, the better it will be for the group.
---
Black Rock Spire instance that has a Jed Runewatcher spawn, one day I will get my trinket...
---
A friend of mine did something similar in the last boss of ToC back in WotLK. I can‚Äôt remember if he did it as a DK using path of frost or as a shaman using the walk on water buff but I remember watching guildies die and it was hilarious lol.
---
So nothings changed haha
---
Joining a guild won't solve your problems with finding a group.  You keep saying that but that's not a viable solution.
---
Yea they kinda really need to adjust spawn rates.
---
1 Black Lotus spawn/Hour for 4000 players is much more available than for 8000 players. Obviously. Same for mob spawns. 
---
No changes would mean keeping the meaningful relations the same (mats/character) and not cement spawn rates while increasing player count.
---
Did the blue post from a couple weeks ago not say all servers were at either one layer or two? I could have misunderstood but that‚Äôs what I took away from it. Something does seem up though because Whitemane appear to have a population spike this week at the same time as others but it wasn‚Äôt listed as one of the ones reduced to a single layer from what I could find.
---
Haha that‚Äôs great! I can‚Äôt stop picturing it now too thanks
---
It actually kinda makes sense, even lore-wise that no one goes there though right? Aren't the elves supposed to be like this super austere isolationist faction?
---
Winterspring because of it's calm atmosphere and an indication you are on the final stretch to 60!
---
Felwood! I always love the dark and dangerous atmosphere, it makes me feel like I stumbled upon the woods in Nightmare Before Christmas, or Darkwood in Fable. It feels mysterious and gives me the creeps of which I like. I feel like thats what I seek in fantasy games like WoW!
---
I save you on your repair bill by healing you, please pay me.
---
It didn't occur to me to do that. We were both questing in the area until he got close enough that I could see (and recognize) his name. A little later after killing him I saw him in the distance via tracking and was ready with a trap by my feet and got him again.
---
Molten Core
---
Expansions.
---
I'm joking. My son plays mage.
---
I do sell water to randoms that whisper me and that's the rate they pay.
---
It's still 9x cheaper to buy from me than a vendor. As a bonus I dont have to waste my time and actually get compensated fairly.
---
The idea of 'Free Gold' is ridiculous. The opportunity cost of me making and trading the water is greater than if I just farmed mobs at 1g. It costs me money to sit there and dole out water if I was getting anything less than 1g60s for 6 stacks. So that's what I charge.
---
Yeah, but if you wiped the next guild in line was sitting there waiting and would take it.
---
Thad the worst part about resto. You can‚Äôt even equip the axe to remember the good times.
---
Here‚Äôs me with an earthshaker, Sabatons of the flamewalker and full dire maul mail/rings etc and I wear my tier 1/2 instead and heal :(
---
Obviously this isnt 1:1, everyone can figure that out easily.
---
This has been done in runescape for years.
---
The lock shouldnt need to drink, the priest needed to as long as they buffed it's quite a bit of mana. But being toxic isn't an excuse f them. I've had a couple tanks get in instance and just pull instantly withouth realizing prayer of fort is a huge chunk of mana. Slow is smooth smooth is fast.

Can you pseudo-battle Rez by FDing, dropping combat, and cabling?

&gt; The leader is an awful player/person.

How ironic in a post decrying judgementalism, the top comment is equally judgemental in the other direction.

Will this allow healing to be displayed over the party members head? Much like how Retail wow is? I manage w/o out it, but its the one thing that bothers me while healing parties and raids. Doesn't make a huge difference but its a nice feature to kinda understand where people are i guess.
---
IDK if MikScrollingBattleText can do this, I know it will display the amounted healed and to whom, but it won't display it over the players character in a 3D environment, maybe i haven't configured it correctly?
---
Anyone have any advice?
---
Just to pad the stats? That's not really worth it.
---
I often save horde players from mobs, then kill them. Very sick and sadistic.
---
I had a warcock in vanilla. We would summon people in a specific spot where they would end up stuck and in a falling animation. Some people got stuck for a long while before they figured out to use unstuck or something.
---
Whats wrong with Lei of Lilies?
---
Or they could try to get better at self control and time management. Just because something is so fun doesn't mean you can't do it ..why do people always suggest quitting. So if anything fun comes along you shouldn't do it? I seriously just don't get this. It's not like a drug where it physically fucks up your body, practicing self control and limiting yourself is part of life...
---
Haha the smell of horde on your reply is insane. As alliance you will get instakilled over and over till you zone back in
---
Wow I‚Äôm dumb.
---
Back in classic I was a little shit head. I was angry that my guild wouldn't give me the fr lw patterns in mc. So I left group and stole the whole major Domo chest. Including one of the items for the hunter epic. Surprisingly that was the last raid I did until name changes came out.
---
He knew I used to, but I had stopped because I don't like playing with other people and the number of good, interesting games you could play alone became less and less over the years.  He plays LoL, and tried to get me to play that with him.  Yea, FUCK those people.  So, we still don't play together but he's at least not sitting alone in a room for 6 hours a day staring at my un-manned rig anymore lol
---
I wait at the end of really long/difficult escort quests and kill any horde that are about to complete it.
---
Does anyone know of a floating combat text addon that can display my healing numbers? A basic google search shows some people saying it can't be done in classic due to some 3D display thing? I'm not sure.
---
I tried Mik Scrolling Battle Text but it wasn't being recognized when loaded.
---
The GIANT FLOATING NECROPOLIS OF NAXXRAMAS! Always wanted to Give good ol KT the beat down he deserves.
---
What‚Äôs wrong with silent people lol.
---
Stories like these are what make the game for me. I will never understand the point of world pvp on retail where everyone is just a visitor via phasing and you can pretty much guarantee you'll never see them again (or get revenge).
---
And there's no reason to try and put someone down for doing so, but yet here you are. It's a public forum but that's not license to be an ass; do you get enjoyment out of spending your own valuable time trying to tell people how to live their lives and when they should and shouldn't speak?
---
LEATHER BELT LEATHER BELT LEATHER BELT UUUUUNNNNGGGGHHHHH
---
The last Barov is asking you to kill the quest giver from the other faction (two Barovs fighting each other for money). Order must be restored is also a pvp raid quest (for alliance) asking you to kill an elite from the horde.
---
private server cancer
---
Thank you! I don‚Äôt know what made me think of it but it just kind of felt right?
---
Mage is a good class for children since we only push 1 button.
---
They're not changing that kind of group aggro. That's a chained pull. What they're talking about are groups of mobs that are hard coded to pull together (scarlet Oracle/messenger and their guards for instance).
---
I would say mp5 = 3-4 int,
---
1.3-1.5 healing power = 1 int
---
maybe just under 2 spirit = 1 int
---
I think once you get 3 transcendance, spi = int, it may be slightly better but not significantly.
---
Should be said I'm assuming 5 minute fights for all these calculations, and 24 seconds outside the 5 second rule. The duration of fights changes the value of these stats, int becomes weaker compared to all the others.
---
So let me get this straight:
---
1. I buy a bunch of tokens from blizzard 
---
2. I sell these in retail on the AH for retail gold
---
3. I sell (or find an intermediary/escrow to trade thru) my retail gold for another player‚Äôs classic gold
---
How is this not real world item trading?
---
It seems like blizz specifically wanted gnomes to be the go to twink race then.
---
You're taking a comment on reddit way too seriously my dude, do you go outside?
---
No. Next?
---
Even Phase 1 it gets odd. (Shoulders in particular)
---
I just use these lists as a reference. I‚Äôm not going to follow it completely because some guys I don‚Äôt know did the ‚Äúresearch‚Äù on private servers.
---
Seriously, I think I've gotten like 20s total from people paying for water lol everyone just wants it for free so they get 1 stack
---
Im a healer who runs with a tank warrior partner and typing "LF3 DPS" is the greatest feeling ever.
---
Yeah I'm Drgummybear! We quested a bit in Ashenvale area, still got you on my friends list :D. Glad you're enjoying the game and awesome artwork!
---
There‚Äôs zero way to know if the tank would actually use the item or sell it. Some tanks could value the gold from selling it over it being a mild upgrade. So to mitigate that risk, everyone needs it.
---
No but you can buy tokens for retail gold and then trade the retail gold for wow classic gold. Although I feel like it's gonna be hard to find someone willing to do that ....
---
Kill devilsaurs and dont loot them for a real fun time. Waiting for a skin? How unfortunate the corpse isnt empty.
---
man, i hate flying over too the argent dawn quarter master and spending 2g per stack so i might as well pester some mages for 20g worth of water but ofc ill only offer 1g, thats all they deserve. there lives are too nice anyway! I deserve the high life not them!
---
MOAR PLS. =)
---
The music is so great
---
You‚Äôre a lock, which is a shittier version of a mage . You will never out dps mage.
---
Locktard has more of a ring to it.
---
level 37 with 12g! 
---
good god man.
---
Definitely the dancing troll village
---
Feralas. The most beautiful zone there is, especially when it rains. Enjoyable quests and not too many people (atleast when I was there).
---
Pfff who needs a gf when you have the Lion's Pride Inn...if ya know what I mean ;)
---
Only reason to train rupture is to keep rogues from vanishing. Can't think of any other use for it.
---
\&gt;have to keep thinking of polite ways to decline requests to tank
---
REEEEEEEEE it is
---
Good call
---
Yeah lots of guides include these short distance hearths and even include strategic suicide/spirit res to save time.
---
Wrote a reply to a comment about flying mounts that has been deleted whilst I composed my reply but thought I'd post it anyway:
---
Flying would be fine if there were still limits to it.
---
Imagine flying mounts had a fatigue bar so you could only fly for short periods. Or/and a long CD timer that only started to reset after dismounting so you had to use them tactically. An altitude ceiling would be good too so that ranged classes could target you in PvP areas.
---
Different mounts could have varying reset timers, speeds, max altitudes &amp; fatigue resistance.
---
We just got a very easy and boring flying system.
---
I mean, I'm gunna get naked if the other factions got him. Probably not tauntable... That'd be fun.
---
they could have someone burn it to the ground since no one cares about it anyways
---
&gt;it slowly wears you down 
---
Speak for yourself. I find it pretty easy to press a button on my keyboard a couple of times every so often. 
---
LOL
---
It's really unfortunate that you missed our on the Western and Eastern Plaguelands questlines... The story is exceptional in those zones and I feel would have redeemed your opinion.
---
Thank you for the honest answer!
---
This guy!
---
Well clear communication would also give rise to stockpilers and even more panic buying so I guess they want us to discover stuff on our own.
---
For e.g. Dire. Maul nerf has given rise to some new videos and content.their plan all along!!!
---
Well if you had you wouldn‚Äôt have made the comment. Not calling you a lair tho.
---
Lakeshire. It's such a quaint, picturesque town.
---
I'm not telling you to, but I'll gladly take my 6 stacks for 1g. Like i said 90% of mages will put up 6 stacks if i show 1g. IDc how much gold you have, congrats on your earnings, would you like a cookie now?
---
  Mages have literally become a meme to me. Entitled, not wiling to put in the work for their gear, cry when they don't get loot, I as a fing shadow priest look below me and laugh at any mage I out dps. I'm loving my time in game pvping, dungeon running, while the mages are falling by the dozen cuz of burn out. Enjoy your riches, but it's not that impressive to me.
---
Blackrock Mountain entrance because it's essentially the gauntlet of death, it took me years to unlearn the uncomfortable feeling that an enemy could pop out of any nook and crevice of the hallway.  
---
Now it's back in full force. No other place in a video game world has ever made me feel the way that corridor does. I love it.
---
With which weapon enchant?
---
Stranglethorn Vale.  I'll never forget how nervous I became when I saw an enemy of the opposite faction and how we would fight often there.
---
Class buff reagents lololololol
---
You're clearly butthurt over something, normal people don't respond this way over a mere difference in the definition of trolling. Which, by the way, my actions in the OP definitely are.
---
If something so innocuous makes you this mad, you need help. 
---
Either way, done with your whinning over nothing. Go bitch at someone else lmao.
---
And I still think you're just a bad player that got stomped and snapped. Git gud.
---
Or keep getting stomped, I don't care.
---
Are you.... God?
---
I'm a dragon's lair
---
You‚Äôre going to want feline swiftness ASAP.  30% movement speed is crazy helpful at low levels.
---
It does nothing to help with actual tanking but it will absolutely help with leveling, questing, and general travel.
---
You‚Äôre going to be in form most of the time, so furor really isn‚Äôt that helpful.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong it‚Äôs a great talent, but you‚Äôre not going to be shifting out that often while questing.
---
If you‚Äôre doing strictly dungeons then you may want to grab furor, but it‚Äôs really not worth going out of your way.  Finish out your feral tree before grabbing it.
---
Can i get your IGN so i can put you on ignore?

God I could go for a burger right now.
---
I think he says "interest ye on a pint?", with pint being "slang" for beer
---
To be fair magic is a bit of a touchy subject to night elfs
---
You still gotta run to the dungeons, so move speed 100%. Finishing primal fury at 27 or getting charge at 27 instead isn't going to be that bad, compared to 30% faster movement outside.
---
I was hesitant at first of getting a gaming mouse with so many button but once the muscle memory start to settle in... you will step up  your game so much.  I'm quite sure shaman is the class that require the most keybinding to be at the top of their game.
---
THIS &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://youtu.be/mqpY5kEtA2Y is my favorite Paul Rudd thing ever. I love him. and TAYNE.
---
Had some low 50s begging for a BRD tank/carry for an hour in guild the other day. They had a 54 warrior with them. So I was ignoring the requests and focusing on my stuff. I made the mistake of saying something in g chat a few minutes later and they all start begging me by name to help. Buttering me up real good... pleading... etc.... ugh.
---
Anyways, I finally said fuck it I'll do it to get them to stfu.

‚ÄúJim helped me hit 60 in EPL. He needs his Ony escort. Who wants to come with us?‚Äù ‚ÄúOh dude Steve I got you bro. We just need one more DPS.

---
This is way better than Queueing up in LFD.
---
Haha, i quoted this exact line running to scholo last night with a few friends
---
Looking at his post history, I‚Äôm not sure if he‚Äôs a troll or just the type of person who needs to consult others before making literally any decision.
---
2 weeks zero que on Kromcrush,   
---
layering removed,   
---
50 minute que last night.    
---
/s Seems the anecdotal evidence points to you being correct.
---
Look forward to your guild imploding when team 2 gets tired of being shit on by your main raid
---
I literally seen people ignore the groups forming in guild just to ask around in trade chat. Then leave the guild only to bitch about how no one is doing anything. It boggles my mind. These people need to go away a lot faster than they are. Unfortunately BFA is absolutely dead (visited my server Tichondrius during peak hours to confirm), so they feel obligated to continue playing this version of the game.
---
This is a thing for Necromancers in ESO.  Since necromancy is illegal, if you use any necromancy spells in a town youll get a bounty on you.
---
They did. And my guild doesn't want to trans. I'm lucky if I get in at like 8:30 on weekdays.
---
Silvermoon feels totally rushed. From the outside it looks great, but the actual locations are all very stretched out, there's no verticality to it. That's why the distances are so long. One of the cool things about TB and UC is that you can walk almost anywhere that you can see, it isn't just fake decorations on the upper stories like Silvermoon.
---
This right here is the answer.
---
Un‚ÄôGoro Crater. The aesthetics of this zone and just the intense danger there is all around you makes it a blast. Great memories of this place back in the day.
---
Oof. Sometimes I drop the strength totem too.
---
The bear is a bank for the bird.
---
UC is great, once you know the different npc spots it's actually the  fastest city to get things done
---
Oh god, is he stroking her rod?
---
Best part is the shit he can do with his hands and a phone!
---
... yes?
---
Duh?
---
"You are probably an idiot" in response to you saying he is projecting is a hilariously ironic response to have
---
Graphics?  Code?  I use a stick in the sand and a coin.  Get on my level.
---
Not when you crit for half the mobs health.
---
Yep, one dropped in ubrs last night
---
What guild are you in so I can make sure I never join it?
---
Why would you need an inn in a capital city? I thought no one uses them there (that's why they're so shit - look at the inn in orgrimmar lol)
---
Yep. Or how literally the second I get on I have 3 separate whispers to run 3 separate dungeons, and I haven't even had time to do my log-on ritual of checking the AH yet and then jumping around IF for 10 minutes. That's like asking me to wake up and go to work without getting in my morning dump and shower. Why would you do that to someone?
---
Without conversing with the guy, it's impossible to know. You should have asked.
---
I will venture a guess though. Lightning shield only does anything if you get hit, which in most cases means the tank isn't properly doing his job. So he's saying you're wasting a GCD and mana by casting LS. Course, maybe he doesn't realize it lasts 10 minutes if you don't take damage... not like that one 1.5s cooldown and whatever pittance of mana LS costs is going to make that big a difference.
---
It's an purely raid spec, you can't pvp nor farm with it. I advise to take sm/ruin which is mouch more versatile.
---
*you here?*
---
I don't know... but if they were going to add another Warfront I'd rather see the Alliance try to reclaim Alterac than invading Silvermoon and I believe there was evidence of Alterac as a Warfront.
---
Most likely earthshock. They should be using flame shock as it doesn‚Äôt have high threat generation. Rank 1 earthshock is for interrupting spell casters
---
Objection, relevance?
---
Hunter: Bank it until BWL releases
---
Melee Dps: hit with it every time u attack until you upgrade in MC
---
Keep yer feet on the ground!
---
Yeah except the trainer is in Hammerfall, Arathi Highlands. Quest is called triage.
---
It was a mage vs mage matchup... But one mage had a rogue partner. Kind of off sets your point
---
Welp you sure got me there. I totally guage my experience by comparing my dps to other classes.
---
Loot council is used by every half decent guild in WoW these days. Get used to it you boomer
---
If people want to be corrupt they will be corrupt with any loot system
---
The problem is that the 15 Agi enchant that makes Dal'Rends better isn't out yet. They truly aren't preraid bis at the moment.
---
Darkshore and Ashenvale mean Darnassus is somewhat relevant for night elves leveling and questing, but otherwise you can easily avoid it. (I love the vibe of Darkshore and Teldrassil isn't bad either.) Just recently I had to tell some level 45+ guildies where the flight path even was (I'm nelf, most of them aren't) since we helped out some lower level guildmate with Blackfathom Deeps. Even if races from the Eastern Kingdoms eventually cross over, both Ratchet and Theramore work fine as entry points into the continent. At mid level I banked a fair bit at Ratchet and for higher levels it was often Gadgetzan unless I was in Felwood or Azshara. It's all a shame too because I love Blackfathom Deeps and think it's much better than the boring but easy Stockades, and even has some nice loot too.
---
Basically "we have nearly no way to enforce this, if you wanna get yourself fucked over though, you are more than welcome"
---
I've played with a tank that insisted on playing in first person. It was fucking terrible. They couldn't hold agro on anything and would run off randomly to mine rocks, even mid combat because they had no idea what was going on around them.
---
Pretty much my vanilla experience despite killing them a bunch
---
Just because you have trouble imagining why someone would choose anything other than the safest and easiest choice doesn't make them a liar.
---
Let‚Äôs say server cap is 10k
---
With layering x2, it‚Äôs 5k per layer not 20k total capacity.
---
I mean.. the Aldor? But yeah,. Wrath till Wod, there was zero draenei rep
---
Disagree. As a warrior I'd expect to roll on Blackcrow pre-Dire Maul and expect a hunter to roll on Dal'Rends... if DR was preraid bis, which it isn't, since +15 agi enchants don't exist yet.
---
As a dps I've started doing that but there are definitely times when I've entered a zone and advertised myself and get a group right away. Whether it's cause they were looking for a bit and I never saw or for another reason
---
Also have certain totems on individual binds, but I didnt want to be too confusing in my original post.  I've got grounding bound to ~ and Tremor to T for example, for easy dropping because typically they are used in important or pvp situations where they need to be down quick.
---
E: Also, just for the record, I have certain totems that are never bound and I simply swap them into one of the F slots if needed.  For example, Nature Res totem, Tranq air, Frost res totem, etc.  Very situational and usually just unbind for the run needed and then replace back to normal.
---
&gt; ...but if you're not playing the game in first person mode you're a fucking idiot.

Welcome to blizzard in 2019
---
Almost 2 months and Hunters *still* cannot feign+trap, an iconic class move, meaning they get wrecked by rogues and warriors when they should counter them hard
---
Rogue vanish still buggy
---
But! Splitting packs which help struggling warriors complete hard ass quests?? Fuck em! Patch it ASAP!
---
Barrens. The zone itself feels like a big world, just as it was many years ago on my first character.
---
lol thats pretty clever
---
thier loss!
---
Bro sometimes we just chilling smokin a bowl and watching Netflix. Not everyone has to be the "funny man" that was described
---
Dun Morogh, the ambience always gets me relaxed and sets my mood high
---
it's not that serious...take the rank 1 and sit down and drink.
---
Yeah the server was 2 layers before and is now unlayered.
---
Just really don't understand how Blizzard comminication is so bad.
---
It's just too far out of the way
---
These are just the basic ones, I followed some advice of the previous users that reviewed them and made the following:
---
&gt; Rank 1 Earth shock for interruptions and highest rank for damage.
---
\#showtooltip
---
/use [mod:alt] Earth Shock; Earth Shock(rank 1)
---
&gt; Use this for short and long mob tagging
---
/use [mod:alt] Earth Shock(rank 1); Lightning Bolt(rank 1)
---
&gt; Weapon buff switching (Normally, I use rockbiter for solo play)
---
/use [mod:alt] Windfury Weapon; [mod:ctrl] Flametongue Weapon; [mod:shift] Frostbrand Weapon; Rockbiter Weapon
---
I also have macro for: 
---
* Using between mount and ghost wolf.
---
* Use highest rank healing wave and lesser healing wave.
---
As someone going heals for the first time ever for a totally different experience, I'd like to know this as well.
---
Do arena + angerforge + golemlord runs IMO, will give you Nagelring for tanking, and HoJ + glad chest for dps. Level range seems right for 55 IMO
---
Cool story bro. Don‚Äôt be made cause you tried to low key brag about killing bad 60s at 52 or whatever and then got called out on it.
---
Well IF has no druid trainer. Fuck IF Darnassus gang for life
---
I love Azshara, it's always fall there.
---
please, I rewatched seasons 1-6 of the x files while tanking dungeons/mc/ony
---
I just made another post with a different GM confirming it. Check my posts
---
Gnome Rogue. Gnomes have a CC break too.
---
Also little man syndrome makes them aggro.
---
What is your rep with gnomeregan exiles?  I believe you need to be honored with them to get your 10% discount(as a gnome).
---
Cold snap if they resist
---
Having a bad day?
---
Some of us like to suffer.
---
What's also worrying, that people seem to forget, is overall coordination/understanding of game mechanics are much stronger now.
---
In the past it was unlikely more than 5-10 people in your 40 man raid probably had Engineering.
---
Nowadays entire guilds have Engineering. My guild is actually making it mandatory to have 210+ engineering by next week. The ability to have 40 people run in and all throw a grenade/goblin sapper charge into another raid fighting a boss is obnoxiously powerful.
---
It's not impossible for a group of even 20 people to wipe 40-80 people stacked on a boss by just running in and popping sapper charges/AoEing.
---
Back in the day I remember "high pop" server fights over world bosses would be maybe 1x 40 man raid, with a second "ally guild" bringing their own 30-40 man raid, and fighting against 1-2 opposite faction raids. I never really remember more than 3-4 raids fighting over Azuregos.
---
Imagine having THIRTY raids fighting over this shit. I imagine it will turn into "whoever taps the boss first" because by then with so many people in the area doing AoE's/corpse running etc. the bosses will probably die very quickly, so whoever maintains the "tap" will get the loot (IE - just have a druid moonfire and run off/hide behind a tree while everybody is fighting).
---
The first question is "Why do you rush?" And his response is to again declare he's shit at tanking as if that absolves him of any responsibility. It's also a curated selection of chat coming from one side of the story. 
---
The druid is an asshole (though let's face it, he's also probably right) but I don't have a lot of time for warriors who refuse to learn how to tank and don't feel any sort of need to do so. 
---
In this thread the guy is complaining about playing a class that might be expected to do a bit more than mash a rotation and collect loot. Not saying he deserves to be called garbage, but if you have thin skin you shouldn't play a warrior.
---
Is the blade good for anything or is it just an aesthetic thing?
---
Mauradon, specifically the falls/princess area. Visually stunning if you ask me.
---
All of the top raiding guilds have multiple raid groups and their B teams probably shit on your guilds raid btw
---
I‚Äôve played with some bad players. Recently this tank was just downright awful, I can‚Äôt begin to explain the mistakes he made...
---
My most memorable moment was long before I hit 60, in wailing caverns. We had a tank/priest multi  boxer. My buddy and I were on discord and finally realized it about half way through the instance. Surprisingly it wasn‚Äôt ALL THAT bad. But we wiped on the final boss and group fell apart. I guess it was more comical than anything
---
I strip down to my underwear at night and turn off all the lights. Then I go outside and smoke weed in the shed in the dark. Then I sit down and thank the group for waiting while I get ready to tank Strat UD in first person mode with my noise cancelling headphones on and the ambience and sound settings maxed
---
It's super close to Stonard too, which has class trainers
---
Yea but that's 900g plus the what 1000g worth of runecloth, this mount is completely free no epic riding skill required.
---
Such a good read. Thank you for sharing! The part about your old toon still having old notes from friends on the RP server was so endearing. Makes me almost feel like I've been missing out on something in game all these years.
---
And this is why hunters rolled on Dal.
---
This is the logical way to look at it, I'm surprised people actually would rather give some random an epic BoE than roll on it.  If said random wants the epic BoE so bad, he can go buy it off the AH.
---
&gt;How do you gather them up without a mount? I've tried using Mana shield, running close or wanding to pull them in, but usually the first couple I've aggroed return home while I'm gathering more. I then end up with 3 or 4 max in my frost Nova.
---
Try to get a pull in such a way that when it runs to you it pulls a lot of other mobs. 
---
Don't be afraid to use blink, even though it can be quite mana costly.
---
&gt;What happens when one is a caster or ranged mob? I've had a few groups of 5 or 6 mobs stuck in Frost Nova, but the caster just stands there and nukes me, forcing me to abandon, blink away and reset.
---
You find different monsters to AoE.
---
Casters/Range or any monster with a special ability that disrupts blizzard are going to be a nightmare until you get Ice Barrier, and even then they can be an incredible pain.
---
&gt;Same concept, but what do you do when one resists Nova or blizzard and keeps coming at you?
---
If you have IB, 1-2 resists isn't too bad because your shield can hold up. Otherwise they'll probably hurt any channeling and you are going to be in trouble. 
---
You can use Cold Snap to reset your FN cooldown, but I'd save this for emergencies.
---
https://youtu.be/r8xChqg2JWg. This is what you're looking for
---
Top of the bank in Org.  Opening all lockboxes :)
---
Yea, been a few suspicious low bid winners already in my guild. Like a bis belt for spriest and lock which went for peanuts and we have 4 locks and a spriest.
---
And myself and another priest have way more dkp than others and pretty sure we are waiting on the same thing to drop. Was thinking of talking to him about it so we dont waste max dkp getting it. Not sure I'm comfortable doing that, just that it has crossed my mind.
---
We do dkp decay, but I dont really like it. Some weeks just no items drop for us to bid on and it seems wrong to be penalized for that. Though that is partly our hybrid systems fault. We go loot council on predefined items and list rotation on tier gear. So there are actually only 5 item slots for me to even spend dkp on this phase. So many weeks will see nothing worth bidding on. And if you bid and lose, you also take a bigger decay :/ ..  no system is really perfect.
---
I hope you are On an RP server!
---
I read the title as "Found an old friend while fisting"
---
No they weren't. Provide evidence.
---
Leveling single-target might not be technically as efficient as AoE, but it is significantly easier. I would suggest leveling to at least 40 as single-target.
---
Once you hit 40 you'll have access to all of the tools you need to effectively AoE grind: Mount, Counterspell, Ice Block, Cold Snap, Ice Barrier.

If you insist on AoE before 40 then you need to make clever use of terrain, abusing line-of-sight to group up ranged with melee, or you just AoE what's there even if you are only getting a few mobs at a time. Casters can be counterspelled, but you will have no way of dealing with hunter-type mobs until you get Ice Barrier, and even then your way of "dealing" with them is just accepting the fact that they're going to be pinging your shield down the entire time.
---
I don't understand, how is the loot being distributed? Are you just losing rolls?
---
&gt;I‚Äôm a warrior of honor. And no money
---
I genuinely laughed at this part
---
Counter spell them while casting, ice barrier(think it‚Äôs the name of spell,) also LOS them
---
This was on a private server while I was waiting for classic.  Players under level 15 couldn't whisper or talk in chat (to prevent spam), so this guy couldn't complain about me. 
---
I was on a 60 Orc Hunter in Durotar, taming a low level pet.  I was on what I called a Pet Safari, to learn every pet ability I could (wasn't planning on getting Bite 8, Furious Howl 4, or Lightning Breath 6, since those are from raids).  Another player comes up and hits the beast I'm trying to tame.  This distracts it from me.
---
I spent the next hour following this guy around and tagging everything he was trying to kill.  With Aspect of the Cheetah I could stay ahead of him, and I could kill anything before it reached me to keep from being dazed.  He got maybe 1 tag during that hour.
---
The only thing I feel bad about is I think it was a bot, so I may have just wasted my time.
---
You aren't unless you are able to sell it. The price will drop like crazy.
---
Friend gave it to me and I love it! I use it every hour :) super handy in raids/PvP.

If you want another setup, grab a prot pally instead of the 3rd mage. It's safer and you can make even larger pulls abusing the bubble.
---
Warlocks are begrudingly accepted at best, and many warlock NPCs don't feel kinship with others nearby. The warlocks in Ironforge are basically literally segregated. A number of enemies you come across in the world are warlocks too, largely indistinguishable from players by also using stuff like imps and voidwalkers. Going back to Ironforge, a particular shady character in Bonegrip is tied to the Twilight's Hammer cult / Old God worship.
---
In the General options in Elvui there should be a box to untick called Top/Bottom Panel, or something to that degree.

My boy introduced me to WoW. He was still 48 when I got to 60 and 52 when I started raiding. I'm still his pocket heal tho!

we did it too back in the day, but thats kinda bad now that i know better.  if you stand in the right places, you dont get knocked up nearly as high and will probably survive, which is why people use the cave entrance
---
Umm what?
---
EQ1 necromancer had life tap, pets that cost reagents that only drop from mobs, feign death, life drain and mana drain, the most powerful DoTs, and the ability to sacrifice a player for soul emeralds which could be used for powerful utility abilities like rezzing the healer after a wipe. They could also summon your corpse in an instance to their feet.
---
They also had a cool ability to feed mana to other players but I can understand why that‚Äôs not a healthy game mechanic.
---
I was implying stupidity, not dishonesty.
---
I never said anything was right or wrong I was just commenting on the irony. You're putting words in my mouth.

If it's a high armor unit I will probably give it a rupture and kite it around a bit

It has nothing to do with armor btw. It's defense, not armor.
---
Okay cool and if I don‚Äôt want to pick up herb will it be worth it?
---
It‚Äôs tough being a rogue. The amount of gold you spend on reagents is insane.
---
Yea I always keep warlocks just above 75% so they don‚Äôt waste their regen/bandage/canniblize/drainlife etc. the lock I had was just an extreme case. To all the pro locks that don‚Äôt abuse tap I salute you.
---
Meanwhile im scared shitless im going to fuck something up as a dps in a raid.
---
Why are you even out of SF in the first place?
---
&gt;From what I know, I should be getting a 10% discount on my mount and riding skill if I am honored in Ironforge, correct? 
---
If you are honored with Gnomes (Which is pretty easy at this point), you should get a 10% discount.
---
&gt;So the total should be 80 gold to get riding right? 
---
It should be 90g.
---
&gt;When I go to Kharanos just south of ironforge to get my mount it‚Äôs 20 for the skill and 80 for the mount, no discount. 
---
It should be 18g/72g.
---
&gt; I know I must be doing something wrong here and some of you are probably laughing at my stupidity.
---
Make sure you talk to the mechanostrider guy, not the ram guy.
---
If you think that's judging someone you clearly have no idea what that slang implies. And you are not worth my time. Next.
---
Think you have to do a quest first
---
SnD better at rank 2
---
The funny thing is that Shadowmeld is one of the top PvE racials in retail for Mythic + because you can drop aggro and skip packs and content
---
Except it‚Äôs a major shift from those who farm and efficiently make gold, to those who have deeper pockets.
---
Just because it‚Äôs not adding gold to the economy doesn‚Äôt mean it isn‚Äôt a massive problem with what should be a self contained economy.
---
The fact that you can get rich in game by selling irl game time shouldn‚Äôt be allowed in classic. Retail is another debate, but with how much they‚Äôre trying to keep classic the same, this is a huge change.
---
Wow someone is mad he isnt getting a group
---
That quest is garbage and should be skipped.
---
There are two quests with similar items one in the range of 22-26 and one in the late 30 . The earlier one is not good but the one in the late 30 is really nice! Hope it helps

Plus heal is number one.

Oh! I wasn't planning to Demonic Sacrifice my pet if in PvP. And instead perhaps benefit from 2 VW Sacs instead, thanks to Fel Domination and Master Summoner. I only have a medium interest in PvP though, so won't be pushing Rank 14 (but want to put up a fight). :)

Loot council works fine if you just aren't in a guild full of pricks, it's working absolutely fine in mine and every guild I have been in that used one.
---
Most guilds could just establish loot rules and roll on stuff tbh, DKP is heavily flawed too.
---
I also suspect some of the people that downvote me whenever I defend loot councils just can't accept that maybe they aren't as deserving of loot as they think. This is meant to be a discussion board not an echo chamber for DKP supporters.
---
I'm at like 30+ ubrs runs and I haven't seen dal rends or truestrike shoulders drop.. nevermind rollin against 5 other people that also want those drops too.. even getting a ubrs group as a rogue is a chore

Nope.  Selling a BoE for gold to buy an item is a perfectly viable way of upgrading gear.
---
He'd probably still be LFG
---
I think I'm going to start looking for  decent cheap  lowbie weapons to carry around and give to wayward warriors.
---
This guy gets it.
---
Besides, if you're a dps main and they ask you to tank, they ought to be lenient with any failings simply cus you haven't learned how to tank. It's not like BFA where your threat is basically instant, hell I'm running into issues with being too geared to generate decent rage(and then threat) lol that and rdps who don't LoS, bane of my existence
---
10g for a strath run is really selling yourself short btw
---
I sell them in bulk at 1g off ah price and they sell almost instantly.
---
That's a big ouch, thanks for pointing that out.
---
they spawn 3x faster = 3x more devilsaur leather on the ah = 3x less price = buyers profiting.
---
No it won‚Äôt. You get retail gametime for playing classic, so you can log in and use a token from retail and it goes towards classic.
---
So if you offer me a token for 200 classic gold, all I have to do is create a character on a random retail server and use the token, then trade you my classic gold. Retail gold doesn‚Äôt have to come into it at all.
---
Lost 3 bis drops in brd last night to the one random. Shit sucks.

I hope it's server only.

They can just edit the world map drawing to make it fit.

Well you picked one of the most competitive specs to gear for.. shouldn't expect something else.

*Most* classes only really need a handful of items out of MC.

You're actually lucky as a warrior: your tier loot actually fulfills one of your specs well.

If you remember, they did cave and raise the realm caps to get rid of queue's.  This is just that same problem coming back to haunt us.  
---
&gt;With hotfixes that we are currently deploying to all WoW Classic realms, we are substantially increasing the number of players that can be simultaneously logged in and playing. We expect this to result in smaller queues for realms that have large queues, and some realms should no longer have queues at all.

&gt;We will closely monitor performance and stability throughout this process.

He's an amazing interviewer, so focused and genuinely interested. In an interview for another show (or podcast, can't remember now) he said he really dives in the interviewee life on the days prior to each interview. He listens to their music, watches their shows and films, reads their books, anything they've produced he consumes. I think that shows on his questions and commentary, always thoughtful and personal to each individual. Props to the guy.
---
Lol that's just sad, why didn't they restore it?
---
Yes, its' a waste of a debuff slot. The Axe has more DPS anyways due to the +30 AP and 1% crit tied to it, not to mention you're an orc with axe specialization. 30 AP is a little over 2 dps bringing the dps of the axe to \~52.6, barely under that of the sword, not to mention it has that 1% crit which is superior to 1DPS (14AP).
---
I dont think it would be bad but you may be better off getting distracting dagger or darrowspike.
---
In retail, if a guild is working on the last boss of a raid, that may extend the lock out so as to not have to kill the bosses leading up to last boss again - I do not think this is a function in vanilla/classic.
---
No , because in this game you can literally trade the senior engineer card for a card meant for you using the auction house. 
---
If you needed the BoE that dropped, why havent you bought it? 
---
Its almost like it's not even worth the ah price to you, or you would buy it. Its definitely worth the AH price to everyone in the group.
---
This is in line with their reference client, confirmed by Kaivax. It's only linked mobs, not all mobs.
---
&gt; The bugfix to leash behavior of groups of enemies makes the game behave like it did in original WoW. We discovered the problem because of Solenor the Slayer, but it was a bug with all linked combat groups‚Äô leashing behavior. The fix only affects linked combat groups with a leash timer, so there are still plenty of situations when you might attract the attention of multiple enemies and be able to split one off.
---
It's the dynamic respawns I'd guess.  Your server is no longer layered = more people killing them = quicker kills = more respawns
---
If thats the case, the prices will plummet due to wider availablity.  Time to find a new cash cow.
---
Un'goro Crater; I love how it looks and I love all the quests and NPCs that remind me of the NES games I played as a kid. Some of the quests here are the most fun in the game. Plus I remember running loops here for RTVs back in the day.

When my buddies were on their way to turn in a quest for the Gelkis Centaur clan I started farming the nearby area while I waited. Of course killing the Gelkis brought down the entire party's reputation and no one could turn the once completed quest. I did it entirely on accident (Magram ftw) but I felt bad they had to re-grind some centaurs for more rep.

Oh that‚Äôs awesome.  I was literally there yesterday and did something similar, except rather than kill the Horde, I waited for them to flee from getting beat up and grabbed it as they ran.

I actually was helping them kill the guys at first, until we all just started getting creamed and I said screw it and ran off with it.
---
When I was doing the In Dreams quest chain in WPL on my shaman for about 3 hours instead of actually doing the In Dreams step I just sat there in the Room with Taelan and anytime an alliance player would step in the room I would purge the Scarlet Illusion buff since it was a magic effect.
---
Dynamic respawns would be my guess. Did your server drop layers recently?
---
Makes no sense.
---
if gold is easy to farm, then its easy to farm gold and buy the item on the AH. The item is literally equivalent to its ah price. one isnt easier to farm than the other.
---
Go vendor some grays and buy the gear you need instead of expecting   priority on 900 gold just because you might use it.
---
Soo, just Darnassus. Got it
---
I mean it's on the client itself. Either your server says 'layered' or it doesn't.
---
Druids don't need trainers in cities, we can just teleport to Moonglade and hearth back
---
The main function of Tanks is to mitigate damage from the rest of the party by drawing it towards yourself in their stead. This is done by generating threat via abilities and damage. So not only do you have to be tanky enough to actually take the hits, you have to be enough of a 'threat' (see what I did there?) to attract the attention of the mobs you're facing.
---
Son I don‚Äôt give a shit if you don‚Äôt believe me,  but the person jumped and died.  So suck it up and go find another dirty rock to crawl back under.  Kisses x

Problem is, even in those cases, it‚Äôs 50/50 shot.
---
The fact that it *requires* all those extra steps and perfect circumstances just to get a 50% shot is definitely not good.
---
Literally entitlement in a post. Don't get butthurt that I value my time higher than you want to pay.
---
Quietly move on and find someone else who sells their time for less.
---
I have literally 0 expectation to have things handed to me. Quite the opposite in fact - which is how and why I derive the value of my time.
---
Your comparison is also misguided at best. You get the benefit of faster dungeon clears by grouping with spell cleave. It's something you would want to do anyways (get exp and loot) the added difficulty is the trade off for increased speed - there is atleast a net benefit to you.
---
I have to spend my own playtime for no reason other than to dispense water and food to any random who asks? Fat chance. That's the entire reason you pay for it - it's purely detrimental to our experience otherwise.
---
People actually have found a relationships through WoW so I dunno.
---
You are right though, WoW can be an addiction and if you are you should get help.
---
But know it's not nessesarly the games fault nor is excessive play always deleterious. Some people have their priorities straight, have self control and know when to stop.
---
Hate on the game if it helps you keep your willpower in check, but please stop projecting. You destroyed your relationship not WoW, that or the relationship was weak to begin with.

Flying mounts
---
Its blizzards fault. They sidnt learn anything from vanilla. Vanilla had dead cities and why? Because its inconvenient and there is no incentive to wver go there. Same with silvermoon
---
Since there's a lot of speculation in this thread I just want to add that this is the correct solution. We have 1 mdps standing on top of me (main tank) and she never stopped shooting fireballs at me, and went straight for me when ph 3 started, as the fireballs only reduced the threat of the non targeted player standing on top of me. Easy to 10-20 man this way, since the only real threat is the potential aggro issues.
---
I was once a member of the group waiting. Followed the guy, while lapping up a couple mobs. Wait till quest spawns mobs and he tries to aoe them down. Just run the extra mobs through him to give him aggro. Dies. Escort respawns 5 minutes sooner

&gt;has student loans, or a new born child, and it would serve them much better than me, let them have it
---
Sure, and in that context, I agree I would let them have it. But you did not provide such a context in your initial statement and therefore this point is moot.
---
Ultimately, this is a video game. There are no such extreme crisis case where you absolutely need the item, let alone the gold from it. I would say that our time is extremely precious, however, and if 1000g would save me days or weeks of grinding, then I would argue that it is just as important for me than it is to someone that can actually use the item itself.
---
If you truly believe that a 1000g item is worth more to someone that can effectively use it than your time spent farming this very 1000g, then more power to you (or your loss, whatever).
---
And yes, I am confident that my method is better, as it is fair to everyone involved in the process.

Er I'm sorry what? I've never seen anyone, of any class, in any level of gear available in classic, do 500-600 DPS in a dungeon run. Is your meter broken o.o
---
Anyways what are you doing that requires you to go out and kill mobs in the world? If it's for money, pretty sure you can still farm Mara, though maybe it takes you an extra minute to kill Princess.

Well yes because the distance from silvermoon to stormwind and ironforge is infinite. They arent on the same map. Even with a private client with all the hacks in the world it would be impossible for you to go from silvermoon to the rest of easter kingdoms, but you could just fly to outlands.

Without any confirmation or other outside sources I would imagine it's from closing layers and having one now.

Shadow also heals "intelligently". Plus in dungeons when you have shadow priest, healer can mainly focus on tank only.

Because then other classes can sell it and use it for boes THEY need. That way epic boe drops are equal chance beneficial for the whole group.

We had a guild meeting Sunday making our mission statement clear. ‚ÄúFolks we are slowing recruitment and working on the members and community we already have over 40.

Hunter pets are a little weird, you need to constantly train new pets as you level up to "acquire" the skills that they have, then you're able to teach them to your main pet. Definitely have a look at the petopia website someone else linked you, it will tell you the abilities your pet can learn and which animals to tame so that you can learn the skill.

Usually those spells needed as rank 1 for pvp so priest dump his Mana for useless cheap buffs. I said usually.
---
You are missing the point. The item is rare to drop. Gold can be obtained a multitude of ways. When the rare event occurs and someone can immediately use it, then that should take precedence to just those looking for gold. As i previously stated, in the very rare instances where the item is incredible expensive sure need for all, when it‚Äôs not THAT lucrative let the man have his item. People are just greedy. Finding loot off bosses is part of the experience, buying items from AH from from so.
---
I got the (possibly wrong) feeling that you might not know how pets learn abilities in Classic.
---
Some you learn from the Pet trainer. Growl is the only activated ability you learn this way. Everything else is passive (armor, stamina, resistances).
---
Other activated abilities you need to learn by first taming a pet that knows the ability and then using the ability enough so your character learns how to teach it.
---
[Petopia](https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/abilities.php) has a good list of the different abilities pets can have and how to get them. You can skip ability ranks (jumping from Claw 2 to Claw 4 for example), but your pet won't automatically upgrade ability ranks as it levels.

My guild is using an EPGP system that seems to be pretty fair and transparent. I hadnt heard of it before joining.
---
Didn‚Äôt they also randomize spawn locations around their original path?
---
Reminds me of Goonies
---
No it certainly is not :p
---
Winterspring. It's simply different from most of the other zones, and snowy.
---
Honestly that sounds pretty great
---
I had no idea you could skill up cooking by making campfires. Mind blown
---
Flying was a terrible addition.
---
TB is close to dire maul, onyxia and will be close to AQ. TB is closer to a lot more shit than OG when it comes to emd game content. Its just in a shit position for when you need to change continents
---
Don't think so, if they did they still have a high chance of spawning at the same spot as they normally did before this change.
---
i keep finding that anytime someone tells you, 'just do this thing, c'mon, do it, it's easy' ... that thing is a pain in the ass 100% of the time
---
You can still visit it just fine you just have to talk to an npc to go in.
---
The Deadmines!
---
ya bug then
---
Your post a couple of minutes ago wasnt enough?
---
Well I suppose we could use more firewood for the winter
---
Fair point. I stand corrected
---
So did you go to his house and beat the shit out of him? Or did you just bend over and take it In the ass?
---
Probably 40g atm
---
Black rock depths
---
Why didn't you ask him right there, right then?
---
in what world though.
---
Usually you dont gank a horde when they are low life and they come back with 3 and gank you.
---
they are literally next to each other ??
---
Demon Hunter = fight fire with fire
---
I dont know how far you read but you should read the rest lol
---
Nope to much to do in Classic. PVP, Dungeons, Raids, Professions that actually matter, helping guildies because guilds matter, saving up gold for my epic mount. If I run out of all that I could always start an alt. 
---
Don‚Äôt plan on logging into live till the Anniversary which the guild I‚Äôm in is going to blow up as a group, get the mount and then log back into Classic.
---
Never said they out-DPS the tank on single target mobs, champ.
---
Can you provide a link to this? It's not showing up on the WoW Classic GD despite being pinned as shown in your screengrab.
---
I did something similar the other day. Me and this other guy were both ganked trying to kill a mob for a quest. One of the horde players got credit for the kill, but not all of them. Queue the horde players sitting around waiting for the spawn. Me and the other guy stay as ghosts and sit right on top of the spawn point, wait for 10 min, and right as it spawns we res, tag, and kill the mob. Stole it right out from under them lmao. This orc hunter was pissed and camped us but it was worth it.
---
There is some "fix" version of msbt that you need to get. When I was healing on my druid it was working and showing my heals. I can't go back to the old floating combat text after msbt.

---
Our server only has a few that have done MC as well, at least on Horde, which is smaller than Alliance here.
---
Not a big deal, but it does make recruiting kind of tilted in the favor of whoever was doing MC first.
---
The funniest time I have is when my friends take aggro from the boss and I can't heal them in time and they die. I always say I let them die on purpose XD. My guild is fun.
---
also "put his gear and mount in guild bank"
---
yikers
---
I do single target I might be the only frost mage not doing blizzard spam. The armor stam advice is solid though did not consider that. Thanks!
---
I‚Äôm not a healer. My tank lost a world buff because he was buff-capped and someone used a Halloween wand on him, which pushed something off.
---
I‚Äôve seen his list of 33 buffs (30 at a time since you don‚Äôt always have crusaders procs at the same time as bloodrage and shield wall etc) as well as his list of ~8 debuffs he doesn‚Äôt want.
---
Absolutely. Since when is fairness a big deal? Horde has RFC, SM, RFK, RFS, SFK, WC and BFD all very close to a flight point... Alliance has deadmines, stockades, and...? Yeah that's pretty much it... The biggest advantage we have is ironforge and stormwind being the closest cities to Blackrock... Other than that Horde is all better for both levelling and endgame... Horde has a goddamn flight point right next to diremaul ffs!
---
Back in the day I played a lock from Vanilla through Wrath. You used to be able to wall jump (RIP my favorite pastime) and doing so could get under Stormwind. I used to group up with a couple of friends would go down there and offer to summon people down there. Well, there was a giant hole in the ground where you'd fall through the world for a good 30 seconds before respawning you at the graveyard.
---
I would then position myself in such a way that, upon accepting the summon, would immediately drop you into that hole. I also did this with the big floating rocks in Hellfire in BC.
---
Certain mobs won't cast if they are constantly chasing you, they usually don't stop to cast unless you stop.
---
Ooof! Reminds me of a time me and a friend did that killer Warrior + Healer combo to quickly level together back in Cata. Log on one day to find them 2-3 levels higher than me. I went (uncharacteristically) ballistic. Guess we had different ideas of 'level together'. Up to that point we did every quest and dungeon together.
---
I have yet to run into a single arms warrior who could compete with my dps in 5 mans. They spike on the aoe pulls but it simply isn't enough.
---
Hey Daelron, my mom, got a new game at a yaawd sale!
---
How is it a moot point, 1 class legitimately will put it to better use. Same as the guy with the loan or the baby, fairly simple process. Sure its fair to everyone involved, but I personally only take what I need, whether it be money, food, or virtual items. Whether you believe your method is better or not, I am stating, you are on a fools errands in convincing me of that notion, as I believe both methods are effective, just not always my preference.
---
It‚Äôs like 20g tops dude don‚Äôt worry
---
I am starting feel like everyone should play a warrior to tank at least once. Kinda like how people say everyone should be a waiter once. For the experience.
---
money, friend
---
with no aoe threat is isn't that easy.
---
if we can just use tclap and ww in defensive stance and they dont have 4 target limit then I'd agree with you.
---
esp with dps that likes to multi shot and multi dot or cone of cold or fuck all.
---
but hey my policy is you pull it you tank it, except the healer so most groups learn quickly
---
I never really got into the improved drain soul aspect of it... It feels like it just isnt enough mana ever...
---
I just made a sm/ruin spec and dropped the improved curse and curse of exhaustion in favor of fel concentration and when I am out and about in the world I go back to drain tanking as if nothing is different than when I was leveling.
---
I have wanted to justify picking up dark pack over ruin.... but come on... we both know I cant.
---
It was the guild who handled the situation that asked I share how it was handled. There is no ask for a witch hunt.
---
Your response didn't add any points. It was already fleshed out.
---
I have my hearth in UC because it's relatively close to all the endgame content.
---
Story time - I played a gnome rogue in vanilla with a great guild on the Crushridge server.  We used DKP as it was the standard back then.  Well, I had been working for literal months to replace my crappy off hand dagger, and had been saving up my DKP for the core hound tooth.  After multiple MC raids with no drop, it finally happens, and 17 year old me is beyond ecstatic.  It was literally the last piece of gear that I needed to upgrade, and I had been faithfully raiding/saving DKP for at least a month to get it.  We place our DKP bids, and I sit back waiting on the GM to award the item to me.  To my surprise though, it goes to our main tank.  WTF?  This must be a mistake I think, so I message the GM to let him know he sent it to the wrong person.  Nope.  The main tank thought that it would be a better tanking weapon than his current sword, and blew all of his DKP to get it.  Everyone thought it was a shady move, but being a DKP bid, what was I supposed to do?  I still think about it to this day.  Fuck you, Jala.  Fuck you.
---
Because if you're coming from Kalimdor or Grom'gol (or later, Northrend), you can actually get *into* Silvermoon faster than you can get into Undercity, because the orb thingy is outside in the Ruins of Lordaeron so you get to skip the running-through-the-maze and waiting-for-the-elevator parts. Anything that's relatively near the orb is more accessible in Silvermoon than its counterpart in Undercity. If the city design weren't absolute shit, a lot of it would be more convenient.
---
It's only pedophilia if she's under 18 at the time of the cuddling. 60 year olds can date 18 year olds legally as gross as that may be
---
Blip N Blop
---
Makes sense, you are a traysh man.
---
Wow.
---
Who hurt you?
---
Did a priest touch you?  Is that why you're so angry?
---
Yup, Horde warlocks have to go to Ratchet to learn the Felhunter summon from a human warlock.
---
I do know how, this is whats been frustrating. The pet itself is just a broken turd
---
I wonder why no one calls it W:AR, that was clearly what they were going for
---
I believe it!
---
The commenter who responded with the video link is the best answer. You don't need to go the UBRS door, just that first corner. If you zone in on a fresh ID and immediately run to the corner, you should be able to target Jed. He starts his pat on the far left of his room and pats all the way to the balcony overlooking Rends arena. If you wait too long, you will have to sit in the corner for 3 minutes or so before he pats back around into /target range.
---
The dual patrol in the first room is your visual cue. They start on the bridge, come down on the right ramp walking towards the entrance portal. Then they walk left and back up the ramp on the left side. If they have reached the UBRS door before you get into the corner to fish for Jed, you are too late and will have to wait for Jed to complete his patrol loop.
---
How‚Äôd it go?
---
Piercing Howl isn't really optional for PvP IMO.
---
gdi
---
Your not being offensive your just wrong lol our B team will full clear BWL/AQ/Naxx on release day.
---
You posted someone's name and called them a ninja.
---
&gt;No witch hunts or brigading. Don‚Äôt encourage others to harass individuals or organizations either within or beyond this community. **Names must be blurred if people are portrayed in a negative light.**
---
Yeah get used to it man. My server is awful. Last night there was a ton of Horde camping the Winterspring FP. For a looooong time. 3 rogues, a warrior, lock, priest, mage and a few extras. They were there for a huge amount of time. 
---
Let's say I landed, insta died. Ok, no big deal. Ran back to rez, insta stun and die. Ok. Run back, same thing. I decide to go get something to eat because I'm used to dying at this point so it doesn't bother me, and 25 mins later they are STILL at it. I was more impressed by how sad that is than annoyed though. 
---
I will say, dying 10+ times to get into BRM each run has given me a much thicker skin. Jed resets are impossible though. The other day I made it into LBRS with only 2 deaths and I was *stoked*
---
Black lotus has already almost doubled in price on my server. It is gonna spike so hard when BWL releases.
---
Back when I was a little noob and actually played an alliance character that first step you take into Ironforge is still my favorite and most favorite location and moment.
---
I'd recommend dueling at low levels too as you level. Having less skills is a great way to learn your class better and what it can do with limited options.
---
No, it's fake. 
---
It's somewhat convincing, but all I did was console edit with f12, which OP could have easily done as well.
---
As a fellow healer i do agree with this, its way to hard to not laugh in discord when you see Onyxia turn around to clap a overaggroing dps and you just watch them accept punishment haha! :D
---
that association is severly underfunded, apparently
---
Well dynamic respawns were always a thing even in vanilla, however I think they are toned up a notch in classic unless anyone cares to explain.  Basically, the dynamic respawn ramps up based on the number of people farming mobs in a certain place.   Ever got to an area thats clear and then suddenly have 10 mobs around you?  Thats probably the dynamic respawn at work.  It works when people are all there farming mobs, but when they all leave and you're the only one left?  It can be hell.  I'll confidently say that if theres quests linked to the mobs they will respawn quicker.
---
As for your question on the number of people in the zone?  I can't really comment.  It depends.  Are all those 10 people farming devilsaurs, or are they doing other things as well?  Its seems like 10 people would be enough to trigger the dynamic respawn because there are a couple of quests attached to those mobs.
---
AOE pulls are about 90% of any 5man run.
---
I won't insist since I have to raid hence fury build and I tank 5mans so my experience is lacking.
---
well part 2 of the answer is that you lose out on 15% damage vs sm ruin warlocks which get the 10% increased damage from Shadow Mastery.
---
It's not exactly the same. It is more blue/purple in color. :)
---
This is just you making up rules.
---
Buying gear off ah is part of the game. Its "part of the experience". Whatever the fuck that is supposed to mean.
---
Your argument is basically he should get the gear because it will make him feel good. Its pure garbage..
---
Noones talking about 10 gold item here. We are talking abour 50+ , up to 2000 gold items.
---
Unless gold is flowing like beer at a frat party on his server, there‚Äôs no way those are going for 40. _Maybe_ when BGs and twinks arrive.
---
Which choice did you make, and how did it end poorly?
---
Does offering free water and then writing an addon that will automatically `/say Thank you &lt;Name&gt; for your generous tip of &lt;amount&gt;!` count?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dls0ij/fishing_knows_no_faction_neither_does_true_love/ it's a joke based on this post they aren't an irl couple
---
Right, but I've been farming these for months and they never spawned this fast even with more people in the zone until maintenance this week.
---
I already said those items are exceptions, I‚Äôm not sure why you are flaming.
---
100g is more like 300k
---
Pfft nerds, who misses with auto attacks that much :p
---
low income, low cultural capital, low social capital which leads to frustrastion, bad habits, and suboptimal parenting
---
I‚Äôd argue elitism is expecting your friends to stop what they are doing to help you level, or to play at the same pace you play because you ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have time‚Äù. Maybe they want to do their own things and explore new content they are discovering versus running you through wailing caverns.
---
In addition, addons are easy and self explanatory. Your expectation for someone  to ‚Äúshow you how they work‚Äù is again, selfish. It takes maybe ten minutes of tinkering or reading about them to figure it out- you don‚Äôt need someone to walk you through everything
---
You show me a pay stub for 160g/hr I‚Äôll quit my job and work for you
---
If the prices is anything like warriors, then discounts definitely matter.
---
I think you're incorrect.... :p
---
The reason that swords is the go-to for leveling is because its kinda hard to maintain a position behind the target when ur solo. If you are leveling with a friend it doesn't even really matter from an "optimizing" point of view.
---
The guns for hunters (and for rogues as a secondary ranged weapon). There are some great goggles for hunters/rogues, too.
---
Stockades doesn't even count. The fucking loot table is something like 4 items. It's all just god damn quest NPCs.
---
Or at least a lesser seen perspective anyway
---
Seems like your just moving goal posts now. The fact is nearly twice as many horde are getting raid gear as alliance are, the clear times are irrelevant to that fact.
---
I feel so bad about this when I log onto my tank alt.
---
Getting 4 messages and then having to deny 3 makes me sad
---
I don‚Äôt believe his comment was  rhetorical. He‚Äôs not convincing me. And obviously he‚Äôs going to take issue with anything I say, so I‚Äôm done conversing with him.
---
HS is a good rage dump if you have no other things to use. There‚Äôs a ton of good guides out there that talk about warrior leveling. That‚Äôs why so many play them now, along with mages. Until 30 or so I do believe warrior is the hardest class to level even with all the knowledge out there.
---
wow gold has no value keep your job
---
Thousand needles, especially shimmering flats.
---
I'm a bit biased of course since I multibox 3 warriors and 2 paladins. Got there, ran around for ten minutes, saw two of those mobs and six other warriors around. I noped out of there so fast.
---
yes ive known him for 12 years. i just didnt feel like hanging out irl today so i said im staying home to study. if he sees me on wow hes gonna be like wtf dude.
---
To get to the fp you have to walk into the glowing pink tree. It's all fucked up.
---
Ally on Stalaag run 90+ people into 60+ horde groups without the slightest bit of lag nearly every raid night fighting into the mountain; Stalaag world PvP can get nuts Tuesday and Wednesday, Horde outnumber Alliance yet Horde never win though.
---
The lag problems are at much higher populations on classic than they are on retail because there's much less for the server to calculate on a per player basis. There will be lag but I do think it will be rare for a server crash.
---
This video is 120 ally running into at least 40 horde, 40 Dead Beat Dad's ran in seconds before 80 Fusion did into a 40 man Washed Up raid. Plus who knows however many other people were around the area at the time.
---
NSFW: https://youtu.be/lXrr1lcjj8M
---
Yeah, I was really caught off guard when I first attempted this quest by how hard they hit. Every other elite quest until then was pretty easy, most of them soloable, even as a rogue...
---
I do it mostly because I enjoy it. Sometimes just for practice. I think many people feel embarrassed of losing a duel. I do many /duels just passing people near town when questing and I totally get why they'd decline because they are busy, and maybe don't like PVP quite as much as me. But even waiting for the zepplin/boat while they are hopping around or emoting doing nothing, still decline most of the time.
---
Spirit, you are clearly gay. How much you just want to talk to me. I do not judge you, however i dont roll like that sorry bro. GL on your journey tho
---
What... This a really happened dude
---
Thats how bad its gotten, huh?
---
Somewhat similar even a hunter but I bought BC got like 1 or 2 levels and said fuck this. Went to school the next day and gave my account to one of my friends. This time around its different...because i made a rogue.
---
i think he does have my char added... oh well.
---
Tell that to the people selling gold or getting their accounts banned for buying it
---
Exactly! I think you captured the idea of having fun in your style of game play. Thats a good attitude to have about it too. I can understand wanting to raid rn, but i think earning that cool gear with your friends is much more rewarding. And it feels like virtually impossible for me to get gear i want with random groups because they all reserve everything before im even in the group.
---
Actually he is undead and if you think like undead nation, she is not even a baby.
---
? ? ? You hit level 40 with a FEW HUNDRED Gold??? how?
---
20g tops.  People are trying their luck by  trying to sell shit for 40+.   Auction addons are good, but they only base their data on items that are listed.  No way of knowing what they really sold for.
---
Common items with  + 50 listed? :   Yeah go for it. Auctioneer will be accurate for the most part.
---
Rare items with 2 or 3 listed?  :  Stay clear until you know what they really sell for.  Keep monitoring trade chat for a basic idea.
---
That said,  sell it for whatever you like if its the only one on the AH.  Someone will panic buy it.
---
This only applies to specifically linked groups, not random Murlocs and what not: https://classic.wowhead.com/news=295811/group-combat-leashing-fix-and-eyes-of-the-beast-threat-bug?webhook
---
If the mage has a four and ten minute cool down up maybe, and then they *might* get two blinks off. If that happens you can simply reset the fight without healing the mage. If the mage manages to escape your stuns and sheep‚Äôs you, you get a free full heal. 
---
That‚Äôs all after you take 60% of his life with the *opening attack while invisible.*
---
Rogues are hilariously overpowered in world PvP. The best a mage can hope for is to get away, or hope the rogue makes an egregious error.
---
I've tanked for 15 years, or at least had a alt that mt'd while my main healed (second time ever being a dps) I agree with what your saying. What I mean is that it's a lot easier than people think, if your dps isn't stupid it's brainless, same with healing, healing is so fing boring sometimes. Dps in classic takes a lot more brain than retail, its not just pile on the damage asap. They actually have to know what to hit and watch meters. Please don't take this as me saying DPS is hard cuz it's not. Tanking&gt;healing&gt;dps. Sometimes healing= tanking. I feel when tanking or healing I'm babysitting the dps lol
---
Is that Kek from the guild Kek on mograine?
---
Anyone who just points out a mistake by saying ‚Äúwhy did you do that?‚Äù needs to understand that it isn‚Äôt fucking helpful. It‚Äôs just being an asshole. If it looks like a mistake was made, it‚Äôs very easy to offer a suggestion of what to differently and be friendly about it. But just demanding an explanation for a mistake someone likely doesn‚Äôt realize they made is just flaming and doing that contributes literally nothing beyond letting the player know that you‚Äôre mad. I get that shit can be frustrating, but anyone who thinks the solution to a player making mistakes is to go ‚Äúwhy did you do that‚Äù is shooting themself in the foot in the long run.
---
Healing focus is a literal requirement for any healing build, so get that first. Imp. renew will get shit on by a lot of people... It is 100% my next pick in a *dungeon leveling* build. It's much less good at 60 because of a lot of reasons, but in 5 man dungeons, it is great. From there, divine fury, inspiration, improved healing, spiritual guidance, and spiritual healing are the go-tos.
---
With the rest of the points, it's up to you. Holy nova is pretty much always worth taking, since it's only 1 point and is priest's only AoE. Reach is garbage if you aren't doing PvP, and kidna same for spell warding and blessed recovery.
---
If you have *any expectation* of doing any amount of solo content; you should keep spirit tap and wand spec till 60. Those alone will be a huge boon to solo content. If you want to do a little bit extra, make sure you pick up 2/2 searing light; and strongly consider reinvesting inspiration into holy spec for crit chance. Inspiration is sub-par in 5 mans; it's really a raid talent, but it's better for strictly healing than holy spec.
---
Probably the wife and still got divorced.
---
Such an excellent point and not one of these "need only to equip" people will respond to you because you're obviously correct that all should need.
---
Hellfire Peninsula. I started playing around the release of BC and running through that portal to see HUGE demons roaming around and getting startled to the horns of the Fel Reaver blaring as it passed by was iconic.
---
Id make a troll rogue then hahaha
---
I did one BRD run for each 60.
---
I have no desire to do it again since it's nearly 2-3 hours and only has one drop in there for my guys =\
---
you basically don't. tried tanking ST once, wiped 3 times on eranicus and haven't done it since
---
&gt; Dude actually read what I wrote before letting the shit flow from your mouth. 
---
Says the dude who began the exchange with his panties in a bunch
---
I‚Äôm a lvl47 Druid, I mainly heal dungeons to level up. Can you please let me know which dungeon is the most efficient to farm XP as a group of 5?
---
He didn‚Äôt say he was pvp focused, he just said he was going to do it a lot. Quit being toxic
---
What rogue addons are you using?
---
Ninja'ing by definition has nothing to do with selling. It has to do with one person going against preagreed loot rules or default loot rules.
---
You initially framed your argument as such that if a person who rolls Need on a BoE item that is not that class, that is a ninja. That is objectively incorrect because BoE items are equally shared by everyone in the group so all needing is safer than all greeding to AVOID ninja's where 4 people greed and then one person needs. It has nothing to do with selling and everything to do with preventing ninjas who think they deserve an item more than the group. Obviously if 4 greed and 1 needs, it's a ninja unless everyone agreed. "mind if i roll need on that?" Class doesn't matter. (talking BoE's here not BoP - interestingly enchanters will ask this of BoPs for the same reason, they get more value than vendor by breaking it down)
---
The ninja in the above scenario would be the &lt;insert class here&gt; who says, "hey guys I know this item is worth 500g but I really want it so you all greed and I will need."
---
What they do with the item is completely irrelevant.
---
Okay, so your thought process is that someone who actually needs it to equip and use is just as valuable as someone who wants it to sell to someone who needs it to use? Sorry that's literally the two definitions of Need and Greed. You're Greedy to want it to sell. You're Needy if you need it to wear. Remind me to never group with this guy lol. Are you a gnome mage by chance?
---
Tanaris.
---
Love the goblin/gnome town of gadgetzan and the buried treasure vibe going on.
---
Yeah, it'd be unfair if one faction had super easy acces to RFC, SFK, RFK, RFD, four dungeons in SM, WC and BFD while the other one got easy acces to both Deadmines and DM! Damn alliance and their convenient travel options!
---
And no. I'm not counting stockades and its four possible drops as a dungen lol.
---
It's just a placebo. You won't notice whenever your attacks are all hitting for 15-20 more on average, which is what sunder armor will do, but it'll still add up to more than whatever HS gives you.
---
Keep in mind, whenever you use heroic strike, it's not just costing you 15 rage. It's costing you 15 plus whatever rage you would have gained had that auto attack not been a heroic strike. And on top of that, all heroic strike does is add a bit of damage on to your auto attack, the vast majority of the damage you see in that yellow number it presents is still 80% just your auto attack.
---
At least the original mage one had actual mage spells put into the meme over the revolvers.
---
Come on man. At least he asked. Your response makes you a massive dickhead. There are new players that have no idea they havent played the game for 15 yrs. Try to recall when you were a new player and all the shit you didnt know.
---
Twice as many horde guilds with 4x the players. You don't have to move goal posts to do basic math there. 
---
Also, clear times definitely matter when a pug raid can clear MC. This game has progressive content, you do multiple raids on one day. That's not possible if you take 3+ hours to clear MC. That would only seem like moving the goal posts to someone who lacks raiding experience
---
I‚Äôve ganked two mages (I am also a mage) that we‚Äôre ganking lowbies for 30ish minutes and made them both spirit rez and tp to Stormwind. Both were separate occasions.
---
I had a dig at the Eranikus fight in my original version of the post, but yeah this fight was a train wreck at the time too.  Again, fortunately, we had a warrior that picked it up after I got slept.
---
Calls it a speedrun, no death warping.
---
From a spam rank 1 /2 /3 chain heal perspective as a raid healer it‚Äôll get the job done with good gear, runes, food and pots but you‚Äôre not going to compete with the other healers.
---
Early tier (now) mana tide, purification are quite valuable. They fall off a bit later on. 
---
Healing way is always good as it scales. 
---
It‚Äôs also a very weak melee spec as it has no parry, no 10% weapon damage, no stormstrike. 
---
It‚Äôs kinda neither here nor there.
---
Lol wow. That has happened to me a couple times but not that often. That is when you play the game of how long can I make it take to kill this person without letting them get away. 
---
My favorite is when I hamstring an enemy while they are mounted and they just keep trying to run on mount as I beat them down... or on my hunter alt, wing clip higher level paladins and viper sting them while they just try to run away on their mount as I drain their mana... like what are you doing lol??
---
You‚Äôre not gonna get the social aspect playing as little as you are. Quest helper add ons speed it up but you need to reach higher levels and interact with the economy to experience the social aspect.
---
Pilav is drama mongering tool
---
That and you can just set your hearth to SW and not have to worry about hearthing back where you were
---
It can be done on a large scale, but it's too much work for what's essentially monopoly money.
---
I mean if you have 100,000g in classic what does it really matter? You can't buy much more with that because you already have everything you'll ever need. Making more gold is pointless.
---
There isn't competition. I get almost every spawn that I stay near.
---
I don't hold the skins so I don't care if they drop. They won't drop due to the supply they will drop to demand, most people already have them or have better items from raids.
---
Nothing like a good ass dagger to get the blood flowing
---
Had 3 hunters in ubrs last night.. the amount of saps and pollys that were broken by multi shot was too damnes high
---
yeah i dont buy that for a second unless this guy had like 10 days played at 40.
---
D-I-C-K
---
Yea people will play how they want to a d thats fair. But i think ditching your real life friends and leaving them in the lower levels while u grind out raids is kind of like saying ‚Äúi don‚Äôt really care if i play this with you or not‚Äù. Now if they wanted to do literally anything together like even fishing then that notion goes out the window but i never see them so yea i do usually chat and level with people in my zone at my level but i also have almost no affiliation with them and the experiences i have with them are more empty to me. Idk lol i do enjoy making new friends but damn its hard to keep track of everyone too lol
---
I liked your advice thanks for it
---
I had the biggest fucking ordeal getting my Mara scepter.  Running with a couple guildies who need the quest, pug a priest and a warlock.  Before too long, priest gets mad at warlock for tapping too much.  Understandable, but instead of talking about it like a human, he starts going off on the guy, calling him a cuck, trash, etc.  The warlock starts talking shit back, saying that he was carrying because he was top DPS and that justifies tapping between pulls instead of drinking.  Endless shit spewing back and forth but somehow we get both pieces of the scepter for the quest.  
---
Then the priest hearths out, not realizing that we need to kill another boss to actually turn in the quest and get the scepter.  This turns into another round of shit spewing, the priest (lvl 46) calling everyone trash and saying he would surpass us all (lvl 49-52) over the weekend (he didn't).
---
Needless to say the group fell apart, but luckily we found some more guildies later and finally finished up.  But the scars from those painful 2 hours remain.
---
Yep, I didn't know about the +15 agi part at the time, later found out about it in a thread where someone had the same thing happen to them, but the fact it's WAY better for melee, and WAY harder for them to get. Oh well, can't really expect some random to know all that though
---
&gt;	The leader is an awful player/person
---
Peak reddit right here.
---
Lol high thought indeed
---
Unless someone in your group doesn‚Äôt play as well as you‚Äôd like, in which case your skin should be paper thin and babyraging is good and proper and anyone who calls you a dick is just a snowflake who needs to toughen up (unless someone makes a mistake, in which case see above).
---
And hunters can solo the boss to get it...
---
WF&gt;human racial
---
Vancleef needs to lvl some more before he‚Äôs ready for stv.
---
Obviously but it has no real value because you will get caught
---
Well that damage calculation is ignoring the proc damage of the sword (150 damage + the dot) ;). I was afraid it would waste a slot, damn :(. Thanks for the info.
---
My friend from high school said he once got 6 flips in a row!
---
Are you dense or can you not read? GM literally replied YES IT IS OKAY BUT DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK.
---
I was making a point that RMT is REAL MONEY TRADE. Trading GOODS irl for GOLD in game does not constitute a financial transaction, there for its perfectly legal for me to give you a dog irl and you give me gold in game. No MONEY was traded. 
---
Read this carefully: Real ‚ÄòMoney‚Äô Trade
---
And please read op‚Äôs picture post for further clarification on in game rules between retail and classic.
---
Spirit ress is the sweetest sign of victory in world pvp! Good stuff man
---
OMG SO COOL
---
We let? Being a resto shammy rolling on a tank shield for gold, you didn't let anyone do anything. The tank was probably a warrior and was honest so rolled greed as he probably had draconian deflector, in which case he didn't need it. Or he wanted the gold over equipping it, fine that's greed. But if a paladin actually needed it and wanted to equip it, then he needs it, jot everyone in the group saving for a mount.
---
That is how need or greed system is supposed to work. Not sure if I'm simplifying this enough for you?
---
Or you're trying to justify rolling on items you don't need for gold. Why not just roll need on bop items to vendor for repair bills after dungeons then, or to buy pets or some shit.
---
Should have, but didn't. That's why I made the post. I didn't do the right thing and didn't understand the tanks comments.
---
I immediately send them to my bank alt and forget about them until i have 10 or so stocked up and rogue handy.
---
Sadly bro this is why paladins didn‚Äôt really Tank much till BC. I feel your pain. I‚Äôve Mained a Paladin for 14 years. Rerolled to MT for our guild on a warrior. I make the paladins stand on me and consecrate so I can pretend on trash fights heh.
---
he probably means he is hitting 500-600s with shadow bolt instead of 500-600 dps...
---
which would mean he really does have crap blues on, and a garbage build to boot...
---
Shimmering flats, so shiny
---
&gt; So if Deathcharger drops and 4/5 group members already have their epic mount, should it automatically go to the one guy who doesn't? It's an upgrade for him too.
---
Copied from another poster here. Care to answer?
---
Yeah the trick is to prevent the opposing faction from even entering the zone. Level 1 griefing by allies on Kazzak is more difficult and probably could be considered a reportable offense.
---
blizzards lack of foresight with faction balance and realm population is going to be the only thing that makes classic lose a fair amount of players
---
free server transfers should have always been for the dominant faction, and low servers HAVE to be merged
---
player population and balance is by a huge margin the most important aspect to keeping the game alive and blizz just neglects it sadly
---
I haven't played Retail in years, but sorry what? The entirety of Undercity is now hidden behind an NPC interaction?!
---
Haha thanks I appreciate it man, and this story is kinda true I guess, but we broke up for different non wow related reasons, I'm actually in a good place in life right now and WoW is just the icing on the cake. Right now besides work and family i dont have much going on so WoW is filling that gap in responsibilities very well!
---
I didn't say it wasn't addicting. That's why I said  specifically that there wasn't physical problems, like lung cancer with cigarettes etc. Of course it can be addicting, so can anything fun. Knowing yourself is great, but wanna know what's better? Working on yourself and bettering yourself. How do you get stronger physically? Working out. You gotta do things to make yourself mentally stronger too. Yeah it's hard to stop playing WoW when it's so fun, but jeez if you can't handle that then you need to work on it, not just give it up because the next addicting fun thing is going to have the same affect and everyone deseveres to have some fun in their life.
---
Yeah it was my gayness that made you try to slide I to my DMs. Lol.
---
Its 1,89% chance being more precise.
---
Saving this comment to come back and ask how the LBRS runs are going while the rest of non-idiots are opening the gates to AQ.

Blackrock Depths

So dampen magic when you don't have a healer and are fighting casters.
---
Amplify magic if you are fighting vs physical mobs and have heals

/camp
---
yes it is a repost.
---
Both

Goodluck proving its a scam though.
---
When i first started on classic i had just reached razor hill. A level 30 came up to me a gave me a lvl 15 blue belt. I was only level 6 but i was really excited to use it. Today i looted the very same belt and took it to razor hill. I waited right outside the gate leading to Sen'jin village for an aspiring warrior to which i would give this belt too. One eventually did find their way to me and i was able to gift him the belt.
---
Stranglethorn Vale. 
---
The ultimate war zone
---
He thought I quit WoW forever and just wanted both accounts, and yeah it probably never occurred to him that I was just as clever about calling up and getting my account back. Or he was too invested to create a new character so he just hoped that I never would.
---
I want that door hanger somethin' fierce.
---
Oh really? I don't recall where I read it (might've been someone on Reddit...), but I was under the impression SM was on base damage, whilst DS was on total damage (after Spellpower, etc)? Guess I'll see how I get on with casual PvP later, as I do prefer the DS/Ruin spec. :)
---
Westfall and Duskwoods?
---
People downvoting are drones using guides instead of tailoring their characters based on your current itens and playstyle. Just saying.
---
The horde is more than just Orcs!
---
I am a native english speaker and did not know this either lol
---
in vanilla this grind took me many months... i caution you against it unless you've no social life, home responsibilities, etc..
---
This isn't a post to convince you this is a post to spread awareness of the GMs reply.
---
Buffs on my pet were a welcome thing leveling pre-40.
---
The moment I got to 40 I never expected another buff
---
I think he meant Silvermoon is closer to Outland (within the TBC map) than Stormwind is to Ironforge (within the EK map).
---
Yeah, it's one of the reason I've always liked Strat UD, coming from EQ it felt the most like EXPing in an EQ dungeon. In the original iteration of WoW those habits were ingrained in the people I played with, I think it's much more foreign these days.
---
"I know let's put the mailbox by the archdruid. He's a chipper guy people love to visit!"
---
You should have just been honest with him.
---
‚ÄúNah, I‚Äôd like to just chill and veg out on some WoW today‚Äù
---
A friend would have been cool with it, y‚Äôall have plenty of time to chill together. But you just had to lie to him. Tsk tsk
---
What till you see what Orgrimmar looks like.
---
It took me about 10 years of playing to realise the tree is shaped as a bear... And my favourite race is Night Elf... Shame!
---
Supply &amp; demand.
---
With twice as many mats and now most players already with their devilsaur set... there is going to be waaay more supply than demand.
---
Prices will start to plummet.
---
details shows you exactly what each ability does per hit per crit and average. 
---
you should slice and dice always at 1-2 cp but never eviserate unless 5cp or mob about to die.  my ss does more than evis until 4cp. always more efficient to use at 5 though.
---
Haha enjoy the block son.
---
yeah thats the kind of rogue i want to make, but how should i spec my skills? most guides im finding seems full focused on ust running and smacking instead of stealth and daggers
---
How exactly would that work with level 30+ and Horde zones surrounding it?
---
There isn't any. You set your price
---
Can I get a link to the data on it?
---
Look at mr. Moneybags over here with his fancy stick and coin combo
---
Honestly you don‚Äôt any of this ‚Äúbis‚Äù gear I have a full raid dps set. But I farm in green ‚Äúeagle‚Äù gear 3200hp 6200 mana never had any issues with any of the farms mana and hp wise.
---
Level Warlock first so you can feed your very gear-dependent Warrior, along with potions, food, etc.
---
Your logic is 500g BOE is the same as 1.5g vendor BOP...?
---
I did it in vanilla. never again. 
---
I was the 2nd person on our server to get it, and then a month later they changed the rep gains.... smh
---
Same. No epic mount yet, but I haven't actually been trying too hard to get it. Hit 60, got a bunch of pre-BiS, and started an Alt.
---
Yes because you cant be 60, have high numbers and still have fun right?
---
Not getting that concept is what makes you a tard. Clearly.
---
username checks out
---
Lol you‚Äôre framing it like im making demands of my friends to drip what they‚Äôre doing and help me and im not. But spending time together on a game is different. I even state in my post i don‚Äôt want to just be ran through dungeons all day thats equally boring. Im not expecting anyone to play at my pace either, my point is that if you want to go off when im not on and level up thats fine but if i literally never play the game with you again then it kind of loses a small fun factor for me. You‚Äôre telling me in the 7-8 hours you pumped into the game alone you don‚Äôt want to kick it for an hour on wow together for the sake of fun? Thats a little sad imo. And im talking about real life people vs people youve never met. 
---
Also some of the add-ons are as self explanatory as you claim them to be and i d argue that sentiment in itself is subjective. I figured one of my many friends who successfully and actively uses them could quickly explain how to get them to function or layout a bit with organization. Maybe thats asking a lot of someone though. 
---
I appreciate critique and feedback but directly attacking me by calling me selfish or dumb because you yourself are an elitist is kind of sad too lol
---
I never stated the people who I‚Äôm talking about are being selfish.
---
While your reply is incredibly helpful, I think it's understood not to intentionally go after caster types.   However, sometimes one is in a pack, maybe it was unnoticed.  The question was how to deal with it.
---
If it means blink away, reset and try again, that's fine.
---
I actually like the way Darnassus is empty. Always get this huge, eerie yet peaceful feeling. Fricking beautiful, if you ask me.
---
You forgot gnomer. Horde gets a teleporter a short hop from the BB flight path that puts them just outside of the instance portal; alliance walks from IF.
---
Darn that's some sad shit to hear about bad manner groups. 
---
When I tanked jinthalor for all the quests.
---
My whole party stayed intill all was finished with all the bloods and all the specific trolls killed for all before we went our separate ways.
---
Okay slow down, Uldaman can't be salvaged.
---
That is objectively incorrect. So I was correct about your position this entire time. You believe that is a ninja but you are wrong. If that mace is worth 500g, I'm going to Need it without question and tell the entire group to also. You are the ninja if you insist it's yours because it is not and if you do ninja in this way you will be reported and banned.
---
Please learn the rules. Bind on Equip Items are not yours because you can currently use it or because your profession is it. Everyone deserves a chance because everyone earned it.
---
Shit maybe its not the dynamic respawn.  Maybe Blizzard reduce the spawn time due to expected increased competion.  Due to, expected increased competition, You got all the spawns anyway.  Does it matter?
---
&gt;*When you're playing a PUG and an epic BoE drops, that other player is not going to stick around and farm up another epic BoE world drop with you.*
---
This thread is about blue BoEs though. They should be given to the player that can use them as an upgrade. That's what this whole post is about.
---
to be fair, if you had a good community people would agree who was next and no one would 'out honor them' etc..  but there was always that one prick
---
Deadwind Pass
---
Swamp of sorrows
---
No, not gunna work out well for you. There's a bit of an unwritten rule that your expecting the tank to be level 60 and we'll geared when they're charging you to tank anuthing. If I was paying someone to tank something and they showed up with worse gear than me, I'd make a couple choice emotes at them before kicking the from the group. 
---
Also, the tryhards who would of been willing to pay are already geared. You're just going to make a lot of people dislike you if you try and sell "tanking services" in your current position. If you join a good guild and get a bunch of T1 quickly, you can do it. But at that point that's what people are going to expect if they're paying for a tank.
---
Going strong. Making a killing in selling the plans for arch mage robe and greater fire protection pots.
---
Doesn't irony require an unexpected thing to happen to be called ironic as an outcome? How is this person being called awful for their snap judgement, which hurts themselves more in the long run, not an expected response?
---
If it vendors for 2g that means you need to grind 2g less for edgemasters, go ahead and need that mage item because it's an upgrade for you buddy it's ok.
---
Can't the man take an offday without you judging him?
---
Blasted lands, swamp of sorrow and deadwind.
---
It is annoying now but maybe a good decision in the long run. We will have to wait and see.
---
&gt;Objection, relevance?
---
The relevance is that, in a discussion about if the swords are BiS for hunters, I gave examples of where they both are and aren't BiS for hunters. You can't really get more relevant than that.
---
You shouldn't leave a green space like that left alone, nobody there to stop a fire
---
Poor bastard. If she‚Äôs thinking about leaving you then her minds already made up
---
Fishing can be decent I think, with the added benefit of it being mindless (ie can do it while watching netflix / youtube or something)
---
Sidenote - What about tanking do you suck at? There are definitely ways to improve!
---
If it was easy they‚Äôd do it themselves.
---
I get what you're saying here. Realistically I will give you that one. But that's not how things in a normal pug without any predetermined rule set works. The unspoken rule of WoW is what I explained. Your economic ideology isn't going to prevent people from calling you a ninja when you need and they greed out of social norms and the structure implemented by Blizzard for group looting.
---
In that case allow to apologize for jumping to a conclusion about your intentions.
---
I agree it is indeed debatable, which I suppose is why were are debating the topic. However, Quel'Serrar is arguably the best weapon for a tank until phase 3, in terms of mitigation. Even if we call it 4-5 months before p3 is out, that amount of time without requiring an upgrade seems, to me at least, more valuable than consumables, mats, and recipes. Particularly if we consider, spending those mats on something like lion heart which goes for 800-1000g depending on server, and is additionally a place holder until new content. Not to mention letting other weapons slide to the raid.
---
Haven‚Äôt seen your reply. I don‚Äôt think you are lying, who cbf faking that. But some people need more evidence before believing things on the internets.
---
&gt; Try to get a pull in such a way that when it runs to you it pulls a lot of other mobs. 
---
Didn't really think of that, thanks.  I'll give that a try.
---
Appreciate the rest of your responses as well.
---
If it‚Äôs only 1 caster you can poly
---
In his defence, I‚Äôve had healers that would be upset if I did ANY pull if they were not at 100% mana. I‚Äôve had healers that are fine with me deciding when to pull. I‚Äôve had dps get upset if I pull without them having full mana (hunters/mages mostly).
---
If I gauge that the healer will have enough mana for a pull, I‚Äôll make it. Just big pulls / bosses will make me pause.
---
It is great when you can level with a like minded person.
---
Leveling with a fool on the other hand
---
Ahh the worst of both worlds. They allow people to purchase vanilla gold for game time, and also let people scam you when trying to do so. Fantastic!
---
Thanks, I'll check it out!
---
edit:  That video was very helpful, thanks!
---
&gt; I believe anyone can get the quest from the warlock trainers, but warlocks who complete the quest get an additional reward, a wizard hat, for their service to the cause.
---
I just did this quest.  I don't remember getting a hat.  Did I just sell it right away because it is worse than Whitemane's?
---
Oh noes!
---
I have no clue how you did it in 3 weeks. took me months. I guess i was actively raiding at the time tho. but still.
---
&gt;*Why should one player have priority on an item that we have already established has equal value to all players?*
---
We haven't though, this is where we disagree. A BoE has more value to a player that can actually use it as an upgrade.
---
Yeah that would probably work.
---
Interestingly enough the /cancelform [stance:1] works even though /cast Shadowform doesn't regarding the bug.
---
Grab yourself a Shaman (If horde) or another healer and do DM jump runs. I don‚Äôt know much about them but there are guides online
---
Alliance warlocks do too.  I remember setting my hearthstone to ratchet in Vanilla because I was frequently sent there.
---
ah yes the 7000000th post of this since the servers opened, thank you
---
1. It‚Äôs just a courtesy thing
---
2. I‚Äôm a priest myself, I don‚Äôt expect people to be ‚Äògrateful‚Äô I rezzed them, it‚Äôs part of my role 
---
3. When you‚Äôre in a raid environment and have 39 people who need to be rezzed and are bitching about waking up for work the next day that extra 600 mana does make a big difference
---
Why not? Going by your logic, any sort of need is a need. I need 1.5g to pay for my repairs.
---
Blackrock Mountain, pvp and pve central of Phase1
---
Stay away from him, you hear*
---
Except fake since portal strike is only used in combat and you can't log out in combat
---
I am glad it's get burned in later patches lmao.
---
All the try hard mages use it in pvp. It‚Äôs a free mana gem.
---
I've never had a group like that.  Had one that wanted to Need roll on all BOE to prevent ninja looting.  I told them if they Need roll and don't/can't use it, they're a ninja and I'll boot them and add to my guild's Blacklist (largest guild on server currently).
---
Need if you need, any upgrade is an upgrade.  If it has the same stats but 1 more armor, that's enough for me to say Need is valid.  I do make exceptions if the item requires a level the person is not at yet (also skill, like 230 enchant recipe a 150 enchanter can Need it).
---
This hits home.
---
LMAO
---
Definitively. I somewhat regret going hunter before warlock as in a lot of ways I think warlocks are essentially better/cooler hunters that also have access to magic and good caster gear.
---
Oh i see
---
Conk and bonk.
---
Love that flair
---
N O 
---
HELL NO!
---
Which one?? It took me like 5 days of farming to get the emerald whelp
---
No it doesn't matter but I just don't get why they did it.
---
Exactly. If someone wants to lead a selfish group then it's free game for everyone to be selfish...
---
Oh man, what would those forms look like?  
---
Bear carrying mugs, the tank; Drunken rage cat, the DPS; Ram with a keg as cargo, travel form; Moonkin, uhh...?  
---
These need lots of work...
---
Yeah, could be anything really. But I do admit it‚Äôs a change in mentality, dueling used to be much more common, I never thought about it until I read your comment. I wonder what made that happen?
---
It honestly was not that hard. Did that thing where you would buy silk cloth turn them into bandages and profit because the stack prices on AH we‚Äôre set too low. Had a bunch of afk time doing that. A decent AH add on for listing items. Leveled fishing along the way.
---
So hit 40 with about 190ish gold. 
---
Maybe I‚Äôm not the fastest leveler but at least I‚Äôm not feeling broke all the time.
---
Can RWT the gold. Check out Oakdice. For OSRS, but similar concept.
---
Yeah, I'm over here hand-holding 57 druids begging them to tank, and assuring them I've got the heals if they've got the patience to learn to tank. Wish I was in the position that I could kick 60 warrs just because they haven't tanked that specific dungeon before.
---
One solves the problem of ninjas and shitheads that pretend to need and resell the other is just an obtuse argument.
---
Gotcha. Any good rules of thumb you know of for when to sunder/when to HS?
---
Desolace. In Vanilla WoW I thought grinding Gelkis to exalted would get me something neat!...just lvl 33-38 of grinding. So much fun coming back to it in classic and actually completing the zone
---
I've been tanking since TBC just changed it up for vanilla. Trying something new and to be honest I dont like hunter. I should have stuck with my prot warrior.
---
I was tanking SM lib with a 2h ( WW axe) this lock says, this will be hard without a tank or cc( didn‚Äôt have a mage) so he then takes out his voidwalker to tank. I tell him I am the tank, and his friend says. Put a shield on or I‚Äôm not healing you. I didn‚Äôt put a shield on cause healer was at 80% mana the entire time and I died cause he didn‚Äôt heal me. Blamed it on me for not using a shield and lock said I guess I‚Äôm tanking then.
---
people keep saying this. Sure, this one small thing doesn't matter. But 1,000 small things really to begin to add up. At what point does enough hay become a haystack? Anyway I don't expect a serious answer from you because you're probably just memeing
---
I know plenty of people that stopped doing islands, including mythic raiders. Also, are you trying to somehow blame the issues with BFA on the player base?
---
Let people play the way they want imo. I actively dislike questing because I like group content with guildies the most, so I AoEd so I could spend more time doing what I enjoyed- grinding items with friends. That doesn't mean that I don't think that people who enjoy questing or spend time levelling professions and exploring when low level should play the game the way I do... It's a game and we play for fun. Let's just let everyone do what they enjoy and have fun :)
---
lets be real. any normal person has been in a similar situation where theyve lied to get out of before. its not that serious. i mean even if he sees me on wow tonight it wont be a big deal id just rather not  which is why i asked this question.
---
BS - I‚Äôm a mage, and never tank, and I know to be aware of resources.
---
You know this, because you see other tanks do - or you see wipes when bad ones don‚Äôt do this.. and people complain about it
---
Like to not know about pacing to account for resources means they have never run an instance  before (and subsequently shouldn‚Äôt really even know if he was a good or bad tank) - or they literally never pay attention to anything at all, meaning just boot them from the group.
---
I get if you aren‚Äôt a skilled tank - but it‚Äôs it‚Äôs because you have no awareness, you aren‚Äôt a ‚Äúbad tank‚Äù you are a ‚Äúbad player‚Äù
---
Darkshore - Because of all its mysterious lore and shadowy atmosphere.
---
Is there a way to check mobs/bosses resistances? 
---
For example: from my expirience of leveling mage I assume that farming water elementals is not an option for frost mage, as they resist quite often to the frost damage. Is there a way to check it/know in advance?
---
&gt; Don't like that gnome.
---
Doesn't matter. He's in charge here!
---
I second recommendations for a Totem Timers addon. There are two main benefits:
---
1. The timers. Super useful to know how long until your totems expire
---
2. You can remove most of your totem keybinds. *Most* totems don't require fast reaction time, so you can get away with using the fly-out totem menu the Totem Timers addon provides to drop.
---
With that in place, I've got a few high-priority totems still keybound (e.g., grounding totem and earthbind totem).
---
Then, I use the totem timer add-on to dynamically bind the preferred totem for each category. For example, shift-1 casts my earth totem, shift-2 fire, shift-3 water, shift-4 air. I join a group with a lot of melee, so with a few clicks I set my default-air totem to Windfury. Now shift-4 drops Windfury totem. I join another group with all ranged DPS, so with a few clicks I change my default-air totem to Tranquil Air. Now shift-4 drops Tranquil Air totem.
---
I did this exact thing for this exact quest. I feel no remorse. This quest was a pain.
---
73 times jeez, and I thought I was unlucky at 18 times.
---
Which is better for my frost mage, eyes of the theradras or green lens? I recently hit 245 ENG and crafted the green lens one. Which one is better?
---
Absolutely.
---
Yeah makes sense. In the context, I was doing dps and not really healing since it wasn't neccessary at the time. I like to have it up at all times when I'm solo so its mostly reflex to have it up.
---
Twilight Grove in the middle of Duskwood is my favourite i love the feeling i get when i go there it lets me imagine actually spending time there and relaxing and now with classic brings back a wave of nostalgia. It is such a beautiful place wish i could actually visit it. Thank you.
---
Cool thread, OP of it clearly knows his stuff. 
---
I get what he's saying about a lack of options. I feel like a lot of the time I'm just watching my guy swing, then reapplying rend/demo as they expire.
---
So you just edited the text here? It is exactly the same format as your last post. Like where is the proof that this one is from a different GM if neither of your posts have a GM name? This second post just makes the whole thing seem even more fake.
---
That's weird and completely backwards.
---
That's what your supposed to do.
---
I killed the rogue with a devil on 5% left.
---
Got the devil kill and skinned it directly. Was a fun night.
---
Same difference.    The fact that's BoE is what matters.
---
And what about alts?   If I earn a blue BoE drop, and my other character needs it as an upgrade, why am I not allowed to roll on it?
---
Everyone should be rolling for BoE's.   Everybody earned them, and they do not lose value when given to a player who can't currently equip it.
---
There's literally zero reason to randomly give a BoE to a specific player.
---
Am I able to put any enchant (Greater, Superior) on any level item or does thee enchant have an item requirement? Thank you.
---
People stop islands after they max their heart, which fortunately has gotten easier in 8.2.
---
Yeah you get the quest at level 10.
---
See, what *I* do is a dick move. *You* sir, are history's greatest monster.
---
&gt;so you'd have a warlock casting it, releasing the Infernal, and then running off giggling as it went berserk on everything nearby.
---
&gt; Guess they figured that would be bad somehow. Dunno why.  
---
lol wut
---
Reads like rogweewee in my head.
---
I meant how do you end up with the same amount of points in the end?
---
I guess they did it to limit individuals from controlling the market.   More availability = fairer prices.
---
Okay, so say I'm running Strat and my BiS Truefaith pattern drops, I have the mats, it is purely a priest item, but it sells for 80g. You'd need on it too and screw over the priest who was farming for it who needs it for their BiS because "you earned it too". I can tell you I've been playing this game for a long time and everyone with your mindset will be blacklisted, not me. Your "rules" aren't the rules. They're your way of justifying you being selfish and not a good party member. Let me reiterate that if you won the Truefaith pattern and I kicked you from my party after that, I will not be receiving any sort of ban. That still makes no sense.
---
Not everybody is an elitist know it all poopsocker, you know. Some people play this casually....
---
he responded to the thread instead of a specific comment
---
Are you having a stroke?
---
I honestly can‚Äôt remember why they didn‚Äôt want to restore it, I was a devastated 14 y/o
---
Are there any raid frame addons/mods anyone suggest?
---
It's a very complete game, with a lot of different perspectives to enjoy. I totally understand your friends who dedicate their time to endgame content and I totally understand your way of doing.
---
Try to find a decent leveling guild where you will find people who play the game at the same pace you are, that's what guilds are for.
---
Back in the days I was one of those players who was focused at endgame, raiding, farming, always in need of something. We had a voice channel where we were and we could always be together on voice. This was the social aspect. We spoke a lot about the game in general, for example add-ons, theory crafting,.... No need to "physically" play together to enjoy the game together.
---
Salty horde? Maybe I broke an unspoken fisher rule. Idk. The reason my gf was able to afford her mount was fishing so I make sure that she can keep the income flowing. If someone is fishing in open waters I leave them be and if they are on a wreckage and I'm by myself as a level 50 fisher, I leave them be. I'm still leveling so I try to keep the peace so I can just quest freely. The closer I get to 60 the more bold I've been getting. At 60 is going to be a bloodbath. I tend to leave anyone "gray/green" to me alone as I knoww the struggle when I just want to level and it's also not really a challenge.
---
Immersion, world building, and community are the most often cited reasons why people prefer Classic over Retail, but if you're not playing the game as a Holy Paladin you're a fucking idiot. Viewing the world through Holy Paladin mode allows you to see the world like a healer does. I've had so many beautiful moments because I've played the game this way. Walking off the boat in Theramore almost brought me to tears. Swimming underwater is amazing. Navigating through Maraudon was terrifying. And have you ever fought a giant as a healer? No you probably haven't because you're a fucking idiot. They are gigantic and scary and amazing. Do yourself a favor, roll a new character, choose human paladin, and actually start to experience the game as it should be.
---
I know people who stopped doing them a month into the expansion, when grinding Azerite was still really important
---
Thunder bluff was this for horde
---
I will 100% need on the pattern if it drops. Yes. You can blacklist me but you are in the wrong. You are attempting to ninja 80g for yourself. That is objectively the rules there's no other interpretation. "Farm it?" You can buy it anytime.
---
Allowing everyone a chance at an item of equal value is not selfish. Thinking the item is yours, is. If you kicked and stole it you would be reported and likely punished by Blizzard.
---
Not sure what part you could possibly misunderstand. The world doesn't revolve around you. I truly hope you adjust your way of thinking and try to see situations from other people's perspectives and not your own.
---
Yeah, I've watched Kargoz's guide. He talks about hamstring kiting a lot, and using sit macros to start every fight off by getting critically hit. 
---
I can't seem to get hamstring kiting to work though. I think some of it might be ping, I get ~180, but it also just seems like mobs have longer ranges than the videos I've seen where hamstring kiting works.
---
Lol I'm not mad at all. Horde dont engage unless theres 3+ of you. Its funny how quickly y'all cry for 60s when you lose a fight to a player 5 levels under you.
---
You must be a priest or druid then, both of which can farm Mara without respeccing. 
---
If you're response is, "get a gathering profession", Just wait until phase 2 when there's 1 layer and you're in raid heal spec and the 5 man PVP team decides to corpse camp as you try to get that gromsblood. I'm sure your gold/hr will be through the roof.
---
Tanks and healers are not at all in the same situation. Firstly, supply of healers is far larger than the supply of tanks. Secondly, farming in tank spec is, generally speaking, more difficult than farming in heals spec. Thirdly, tanks have far far higher repair costs. They are wearing either leather or plate vs mostly cloth, and they are getting attacked all the time, meaning their gear degrades faster than anyone else's. Furthermore, they are the usually the first to die if anything bad happens, leading to more frequent repairs.
---
Dun Morogh it is. 69

I've done the satyrs in Felwood prior to DM release, but I needed to use 2-3 of: inner focus, 300 mana trinket, flamethrower trinket, poison trinket, greater mana potion, robes of insight every aoe pull. And some of those things have &gt;30 minute cooldowns. So I'd do one pull every 5 minutes or so.
---
This was with a 6.4k mana pool, the melee ones having about 2700 health, and the damage they deal being enough to kill you if you try to do 7 at a time (even 6 is iffy), them being lv. 53.
---
It wasn't great gold. Maybe 10g in felcloth +3-4 demonic runes (saves a few gold on dark runes) an hour +some small amount of other stuff, certainly less than 20g/hr, open world, risky, and susceptible to other campers.
---
In no way do i imply i need to always be playing with a friend. But the percentage at which i play with then at all is currently 0% and personally its tough for me to justify investing alot of time into people i know ill never meet in real life. I do kind of expect the people ive known in real life for over 15 years to make any kind of an effort to play this game together atleast once in a while.
---
My head canon is they knew eachother before the fall or Lordaeron... That or she's just freaky
---
Lol can you not read ?
---
I also did a similar prank. Logged on to my friends acc and made several character spelling out you suck or something creative. After about half way my conscience got to me and I deleted the chars... and his max level raid geared shaman.
---
Prank was on me because I spent the whole night on one of his alts with a gm ticket up waiting for them to restore it.
---
He wouldn't even have noticed it, but the gm sent a mail to the alt I used to make the ticket!
---
the tank is not a tank. He is a DPS who was asked to tank because the leader couldn't be bothered to find a real tank. It's all about effort. If the leader isn't willing to put in the effort to find a proper tank, they shouldn't be surprised when their run turns to shit
---
&gt;*And what about alts? If I earn a blue BoE drop, and my other character needs it as an upgrade, why am I not allowed to roll on it?*
---
Your alt isn't in the dungeon filling a role in the group...
---
&gt;*There's literally zero reason to randomly give a BoE to a specific player.*
---
Helping someone out? Fostering server community?
---
Which his friend would appreciate more
---
Still a better romance then Twilight
---
Enjoy those times man 
---
Happy for you
---
I found this out last night! I got invited to run WW and had no idea what I was doing. Luckily the group I was with were really chill about telling me what my role was. I've been doing everything solo and have gotten really good at pulling singles out of groups with my pet, so at first I was pulling with the tank on lower level mobs, and we were handing it fine. My pet is always on passive, bc I don't need it running off pulling mobs in the open world.
---
Then when we did the drop, my pet came back with mobs and got us all killed. They didn't chew me out (on public chat anyway), but I'm thinking it annoyed them that I ended up with two chests. I tried to make up for it by giving away lots of inventory when I needed to make space. Any way, it was a lot of fun!
---
My main concern with my hunter rn is that I've been funneling points into concussive shot before I ever looked at a build. I haven't seen a single one with that talent yet. I also have no idea about how the gear points work. Question: I started with guns, but can I switch to bows?
---
Of course there is, but he chooses to avoid questions or whatever reason he has to act like this, he should not be judged for it.
---
been going for under 10g on my server, but the us median is about 25g
---
I switched to fury once I had hit cap for dungs and raids.
---
That's just how the game is? A pet with no skills will have all training points, s pet with a skill will have all training points minus the point cost of that skill
---
I love desolace. It is the only zone where you really get to choose between one of two factions and fight for your team!
---
WE ARE 100% ARGUING ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT THINGS. If it's a 500G item and we all know it's not a HUGE upgrade then yes, all need to prevent ninjas. But that's not what I've been explaining or giving examples of this entire time.
---
I kinda figured but was too funny not to comment. Tank life is good these days for prot warriors, but I must be better at it than I think since I‚Äôve yet to personally encounter any drama about how I do it. Or maybe Whitemane is just nice.
---
Disagreed in many ways. All the items would be BoP if they didn't think selling for gold was a legit move. Need and greed rhyme and that's the only reason they used those words. They don't literally mean need or greed.
---
Ironforge. I love the atmosphere and the coziness of being in a city that‚Äôs inside of a mountain.
---
Well, you started the whole process...
---
It's too late trying to defuse a bomb that has already exploded...
---
Probably Hillsbrad Foothills - Fond memories of my first character playing WoW and experiencing world PvP for the first time. Undercity will always give me cool nostalgia vibes too.
---
I'm not sure why I assumed you were an orc
---
Wrong. Gaslight(v): to manipulate (someone) by psychological means into questioning their own sanity.
---
I'd probably say STV or Hillsbrad has taken a piece of my heart since I played back in high school.....and yes, for your information, I did roll a rogue again! :)
---
Sry, didn't realize you were a different person from the original one who advocated having thick skin. As far as it being not like that, I disagree. Obviously one is astronomically more severe, but it is victim blaming nonetheless.
---
Good luck finding a tank in under 45 min
---
ThanosIDontEvenKnowWhoYouAre.jpeg
---
suspected? I seems glaringly obvious to Alli who went that way to STV sometimes even before ZG came out.
---
If this person values a boe more than its market price, why haven't they bought it already?
---
Lvl 58 horde on anathema.  I‚Äôm getting groups every night and there‚Äôs enough alliance out here that there‚Äôs definitely no shortage of PvP.  Shrug.
---
Seriously, what are these guys talking about? At least from the text shown the guy isn‚Äôt dismissing constructive and collaborative feedback, he‚Äôs dismissing people who are being dicks.
---
How do you do DM:E jump runs as shadow?
---
He has a fairly decent patrol range and if you are 60 you will be able to see him in stealth long before he aggros onto you
---
No one is obligated to use their time to help you finish a quest. Be thankful when they do, don't just expect it.
---
100% STV on PvP servers. That place is fantastic exp and a constant threat. Never a dull moment!
---
actually there is some.
---
A warrior tank for "brd arena, anger, golem farm". Prior to the run he seemed quite experienced and was like this is my 120th run or something to get arena chest and hoj. Turned out to be one of the worst runs I've ever been in. He managed to let our healer die 3 times on our way to golem. Didn't even want to put on a shield prior to that and was fighting with two one handers. Only way we actually got to the end was because of the healer. The "farm" unsurprisingly ended after only one run.
---
I mean that last sentence is totally an opinion, which i respect, but i think itd be alot cooler to run dungeons together rather than just talking about it all day. Just my opinion, take it with a grain of salt.
---
They all want me in their guild of friends but they have like no one in them and they dont help anyone and i cant ask for help in a guild with like 20 people, so yea maybe i should leave the guild for a more level focused one. Thanks.

Layering essentially runs multiple copies of the world on the same server. It's a bit like a dungeon instance, only it covers the whole game. If you're on one layer, you can't see or interact with anything happening on the other layers. A mob might be dead on your layer but alive on another, etc. You can move between layers by getting into a party with someone on another layer.
---
Layering is good because it reduces overcrowding in key areas. It's bad because it reduces the sense of community and hurts the feeling of being in an actual living "world." Blizzard is slowly removing layers as population numbers decrease, and people become more spread out through the various zones. There are probably technical improvements happening behind the scenes as well.
---
Good point, I will have to carefully see if I can reach mushrooms on my lasher runs.
---
&gt;what is "layering
---
Layering is basically multiple versions of the same area. Think of it like instances that you don't go into, but are just part of. 
---
Layering was Blizzard's way of dealing with high population numbers, apparently the current servers can handle around 12k players while the vanilla servers could handle 3-4k~ according to some vague comments I found online.
---
Basically depending on the amount of players in a certain area, it would create more layers so that areas weren't overcrowded. 
---
Each layer would have its own mobs, players, loot, chests, resources etc. So you could kill a bunch of monsters on your layer, ask for an invite to another layer, and all the monsters would re-appear (unless someone on that layer killed them).
---
Same logic applied to resources, you could search your layer for ore/herbs, then swap to another layer and find more effectively skipping the respawn timer.
---
&gt;what happened to it? 
---
It was slowly removed, the layers were reduced slowly and now there is only one layer that all the players exist on.
---
&gt;and is this good or bad? 
---
Both, honestly.
---
It was good because it allowed hundreds/thousands of players to do the same quests early on without ridiculous competition. It allowed the servers to handle hundreds of players in the same area without significant issues. It allowed people to experience the game without having to wait an hour for some random quest monster or quest item to become available.
---
It was bad because people abused the shit out of it, you could swap between layers and skip respawn timers and effectively farm rare monsters and get resources very easily. If you were being camped by players, you could just swap to a different layer and all the players camping you would 'disappear'. If you cleared an entire area of monsters, you could swap to another layer and repeat the process and skip the respawn timers. 
---
In general, most people really disliked layering and are really glad that it's gone.
---
I‚Äôll lie to kids selling candy bars for exorbitant prices, people I don‚Äôt know trying to sell me crappy candy.  But a friend, you shouldn‚Äôt. A good friend will be okay with you wanting alone time. But don‚Äôt try to downplay your poor friendship by trying to justify it against others actions.
---
They deleted their comments, do you remember what it said?
---
This surprisingly worked well, ty
---
It works, but it relies on sitting then getting hit and standing in the same server tick.  It's really janky and just not worth it unless you just want to try hard every mob.  
---
It's like being a hunter and strafe/jump kiting every single mob.  Yeah, I'll do it for most, but if I'm feeling lazy idgaf if I have to melee a bit here and there.
---
Thunderbluff is great everything is easily found unless you're one of the non-tauren classes. Thunderbluff deserves more credit.
---
The irony of this is I'm a mage who was looking for a full run of ZF for the quests. Got a group of warr, sham, priest, rogue and mage...and they all expected me to aoe farm the GY for them then reset and come back.
---
Told them this was advertised as a full run in /4 and they signed up for it. Proceeded to get cussed out and had to reform &amp; restart the run. &gt;.&gt;

I mean, Teldrassil is proof that we're good at making fire.

Deadmines. It was my first instance, and I still love battling your way through the different parts of the instance only to reach a whole ship(!) with a murlock cook (who must be a terrible chef).
---
Hate to break it to you, but that doesn't hold all that much water.  They can easily enough just say "that GM wrong" or "you are being banned for gold selling/buying, shove it"
---
Alliance killed me when I was running the robot chicken escort quest in Tanaris the other day because they wanted to run it themselves. I ended up getting a full party to help and we killed them about 15s before they were going to finish the quest. Then we ran it ourselves and fought them off when they tried to attack us and killed them again.
---
They could have just waited for me and ran it after. No one would have bothered them.
---
If you're not using your bank that much you can **stay mounted** in TB and Silvermoon AH for ultra fast mailbox trips. TB gets the GBank bonus but farther maibox. This is much better for bank alts overall.
---
While it's not a problem nowadays but are also were less laggy than Org.
---
Once I hit 60 and have some time to kill I‚Äôm probably gonna go to Arathi and just give away charms to warriors trying for WW, can‚Äôt wait
---
I currently have 6 chars at 20 because I can't decide on a class that I enjoy(narrowed down to rogue and warlock) so I understand all the alts.
---
Also, I'm on Heartseeker as well :D alliance warlock and rogue on that realm, both human
---
Jesus christ, this isn't complicated dude.
---
BoP's cannot be sold for market value, they can only be vendored for next to nothing.
---
If BoP's could be sold on the AH, they'd sell for *a lot more* than vendor price.
---
So by definition **a BoP item loses value if it's given to somebody to be vendored.**
---
BoE's do not.
---
Stop being intentionally dumb and greedy.

I have 3 GMs who are wrong then.

---
I was going to say a Gnoll Lair, but I guess you can self promote, that's fine.
---
So it‚Äôs fake, and you‚Äôre lying to everyone.
---
tbh I picked a mage for portals. Would probably still pick it with lower dps than a warlock.
---
Intent. The only reason to post it like that is to fish for people making a mistake. Charging 40g for a stack of silk is ludicrous. The other person is at fault too but that doesn't mean you're not an asshat for doing it.
---
WoW was released way before LoL.
---
I just got my epic mount in classic and it feels better than flying ever has.
---
Duel him. Winner keeps gets the gold and the cloth.
---
When I first started playing WoW at release, a guild mate was putting stacks of copper ore up for 99s 99c and someone was buying it like rapid fire as soon as he was posting them. He then posted 4-5 stacks very quickly and the last one he posted at 99g 99s 99c. They were all swiftly bought. He quickly logged out of that character for a while incase he got a nasty whisper and was super excited in Ventrilo.
---
I was so shocked and also impressed that I still remember it like it was yesterday. Keep that gold, lol.
---
You don't, actually. Your screenshot never once says retail to classic trading is "allowed". It does say "not supported". So while it may not be a violation of the ToS, it isn't supported because it is impossible to verify on their end. If you are hit with a Real Money Trading ban for receiving an influx of "free" gold in Classic, you have absolutely 0 ways to prove you were not trading for real money. 
---
The problem you fail to grasp is just because your claim isn't specifically against ToS does not mean it comes with absolutely 0 risk. If a GM looked at your account, it would look shady AF and like you traded classic gold for real money, end of story.
---
Stop being a troll
---
Thank you for the quick response I'll try it!!
---
Honestly, Orgrimmar.
---
It sounds silly but I just love the hussle and bustle of hundreds of people going about their day having fun, makes you realise how active the world is..
---
My favorite place is Stranglethorn Vale for the huge variety of enemies, the density of quests, and the constant active player population! To me, it's the place where Azeroth feels the most *alive.*
---
FAKE NEWS
---
You do know that those statistics are more than a month and a half old right? No one knows what their server's pop looks like right now, with the exception of a few servers that are apparently severely skewed one direction based on anecdotal evidence.
---
Not all of us are mages, and often times when we whisper these people we are ignored. What else can we do? Sit there and wait til we see another "LFM DPS ...."?
---
If you are still running dungeons put those point back in intensity otherwise forget about ever aoe'ing without a mage to freeze   or a priest to bubble.   
---
Try hards will tell you imp cast for pvp or pve extra damage or the 2% Mana cost reduction to extra min max.   You will be glad you can semi competently aoe without having your 1000+ Mana cost skill being instantaneously canceled via pushbacks
---
Some examples of when this helps:   BRD Torch room, and most early mobs, emperor room.    LBRS  Spiders and scorp pulls after urok platform.  UBRS,  everything up to first boss, whelps.   Stratholme, Skele pulls, bugs/maggots from crates, aoe after rammstein, aoe on baron, aoe in cathedral after some pulls.   Scholo, Vectus room, summoner skele's, explosive mob room before darkmaster.   DME, Lashers.  DMW, Skele's on Upper walkway, Wind elementals, fracturing VW things.  DMN,  Dogs, lashers.
---
These are all times where unless you have a mage in your group to carry aoe dps you will wish you had intensity.  You will pull aggro unless you wait so long that there is no point in aoe'ing   but all of these are worth the 2 pts.
---
I appreciate it, i'll try to wait a few more respawn cycles first before doing so. Thanks!
---
What pet is best for framing at 60?
---
&gt;*Stop being intentionally dumb and greedy.*
---
Says the guy that just wants things to sell on the AH. Hah!
---
You can skip him or you can kill him to fill time and get felcloth
---
Yup. Other than that they're both pretty useless spells. Still haven't trained either at lvl 54 yet.
---
This is why PVP on PVE servers is more competitive. It's consensual. PVP servers are full of children.
---
That's actually cool af
---
Be careful. This data is from before Blizzard broke the /who function over a month ago so it's inaccurate now.
---
While population may not have changed much since then we really don't know the state of these servers
---
well, at least you learned sm/ruin is its own build archetype. if it wasnt useful, it wouldnt have its own build.
---
if you absolutely refuse to spec out of ds/ruin, well, youre just gonna have to live with fearing every mob. even the lvl 52 you aggrod that knocked you off your mount
---
Layering is when a realm has multiple copies of the game world. Two layers = two game worlds.
---
The downside is that you can't see players/items/entities on another layer, they are a completely separate game world with separate bosses, etc.
---
The game would automatically switch you between layers so it's been a divisive topic. Many players have taken advantage of layering to farm things faster (e.g: kill all the mobs, get a party invite from someone on the other layer, kill the mobs on that layer, rinse and repeat)
---
I think most people do want the realms to go down to a single layer so that there's a cohesive universal game world for everyone on the same realm rather than being split up.
---
Damn it autocorrect!
---
Look st my other post. I have another GM saying it's ok. The only risk is getting scammed
---
The login queue, because it's the one time I'm forced to do homework.
---
Very true. I went to meet a guild mate ot front of IF the other day. The was no one at all there. Got an invite and i got layered into a raid of about 200 horde trying to get through the city gates.
---
I think these have changed alot so it might be far worse now. This was before server transfers..
---
I hear stelath sounds i cast r1 holy nova, then feel bad for low lvl nelf thats running for his life
---
you dont have to pass the window, you can swim in the lava towards it and get zoned in
---
I guess theoretically you only need an enough high crit cap for white hits to ensure that flurry is up nearly 100%. Which should be around 33%, better a little more.
---
This way Flurry should refresh before it runs out in most cases.
---
I guess the rage which would be generated by unbridled wreath would be not worth it?
---
I think they have made it pretty clear they aren't. They will just leave it layered and say if you don't like it xfer 4Head
---
what man wouldn't call Sylvannis if she gave you her digits? just sayin.
---
All f****ing undead rogues must f***ing hang.
---
Tanking multiple mobs. Two at a time I can usually do. Three is a little iffy but it's fine if the pull goes well. With four or more mobs it's only a matter of time before I end up chasing them around trying to regain aggro.
---
I know there was a punchline before I even started reading because the tag was **Humor**. lol
---
My favorite mount is the Sea Turtle. I miss it more than my flying mount, really.
---
(Favorite land mount: Toss up between White War Talbuk and the Mechano-Hog. Favorite sky mount: Violet Netherwing Drake.)
---
Since when? It's all the same instance. You can literally go inside and walk to any of the other areas from any entrance with no loading screens. If you kill a boss in east, walk out, go in north and walk back to east from the inside, that boss will be dead.
---
Wish there were more realms like Scandinavia, Great Britain, etc...

lol 18 "long term" "life we built"

Any particular reason? I'm on yojamba and i'm really happy there

Are the Hallow's End masks using the new (retail) textures or am I just losing my mind?
---
it was good mana regen at lower levels, but at higher levels its maybe a couple % mana over its duration. i put the points somewhere else
---
Jintha'Alor brings out the absolute worst in people. It's like everyone forgets to think or the trolls infest their mind with wild ideas. No matter what, you always end up with people going their own way, peacing out after completing their q, ninja'ing the open world containers, etc. It's a shit-show and I hate it but I hate even more that I finally got a group together to finish most of my quests AND THEN I FORGOT MY FUCKING MALLET WHICH I LEFT IN THE BACK WHEN GETTING LW MATS.
---
That's exactly what reserving loot does though...
---
What is the difference, in your mind, between a caster saying "lfm 2 dps UBRS - reed on res" and saying "lfm 2 dps UBRS" and responding to every caster dps that whispers saying "no sorry, not inviting mages or warlocks"?

Saying something is reserved is actually better. In the first scenario, you still leave the door open to any casters that don't need Reed, or need Reed but also need other gear and are willing to pass on Reed. In the second, you completely shut out a big swath of players who might otherwise still need other loot from UBRS. In order to re-open that door in scenario 2, you'd need to have multiple different individual whisper convos with all the caster dps who hit you up, trying to figure out whether they have Reed or not already, or whether they'd be willing to pass on it. Organizing a group is already annoying enough without having your whispers clogged trying to sort all of that out. Explicitly stating your gear intentions makes it clear from the get go what anyone who responds to your message should be expecting.

out of curiosity, where is the 60-80 gold coming from? in this video you looted, 2 dreamfoil, 1 gromsblood, 1 mushroom, 8 rune cloth, boots worth 1g11s and a ring worth 75s, and a libram worth 9s on my realm. So either herbs and librams are crazy expensive on your realm or you are calculating the gold per hour based on the 2 bosses dropping their 5g blue every single run, which is nowhere near realistic.
---
Respect at around 58 can be done before. But makes lvling too slow. At 58 you can tank end dungeons and get your pre raod bis and get to 60 in dungeons. And trash blade is a decent weapon. And myrra song is one of the best weapo ns. Pre raid. With the exeption of the one you get from the compendium of dragon slaying
---
At least that is my opinion
---
I dislike how they use the excuse that Darn, Silvermoon, and Exodar are dead to not make any more cities for new races (I guess Zuldazar and Boralus sort of count- no AHs or banks there though)
---
Just make cities that are not a pain in the dick to navigate and people will go there
---
 Anywhere i can bathe in the blood of the Alliance. 
---
So, STV, i suppose.
---
It's all the same dungeon not all the same instance, each portal or set of portals only leads to one instance.
---
People use instance and dungeon interchangeably, but they don't mean exactly the same thing.
---
Mara and Strath doors lead to the same instance and dungeon.
---
No I don't.  Your character wears armor 100% of the time and I rarely, if ever, look at the face.
---
Honestly, I agree. The convenience of rarely missing a spawn doesn't outweigh the crushing loneliness of rarely seeing a player. Retail sucks for many reasons right now and that's one reason.
---
If you're trying to build up a guild and are relying on PUGs in the meantime, you cannot just put all the gear on reserve for guildies and expect to fill a raid. You can reserve some special stuff like bindings/eye etc, but beyond that, people will find another raid with fairer loot rules. 
---
If OP has lost 13 straight rolls on tier1 then that's just the bad luck you have to deal with when trying to build up a guild. There's no stand to be made. 
---
Anyways, if OP doesn't want to do have any responsibility and cares a lot about getting PvP loot (which is what Felheart is) then this definitely does not sound like the guild for him. Which is perfectly fine, gotta find a guild that fits you.

You keep saying tips.  OK I'll stop the narrative for a second.  If you get more money doing that, then great that's good.  But don't kid anyone, they aren't tips if they are expected.  Guaranteed though,  as the market gets more crowded, those with the lowest "fees" will trump those asking for tips.  Why?  Because the consumer are the ones with the money you want, and they will want to pay what is consistently expected.

Black Rock Depth. Best 5 man dungeon In Lore/Boss Variety/Quests, even stealth run/solo content.

All classes are good for a beginner.  There are too many guides out there that spell out every single detail for each class to be bad at any of them.
---
But the Piccolo of Flaming Fire is used for a dungeon mechanic in the dungeon it drops. To force all to /dance when getting attacked by one of those neutral spirits so the spirit dances too and you don't die.

I think the most interesting thing about this post is the comments. It tells a lot of things. 
---
1. People will present an argument without having all the facts
---
2. 50% of people don't actually read these longer posts
---
3. 50% of people are lil bitches
---
Is that why you're shitting on retail multiple times in these comments?
---
Sage blade is a caster weapon, but of course its a sword so does not match your list of usable weapons.
---
why would you go deep into demo specifically to get ds and then not use it for pvp
---
if you plan on doing any sort of solo play or pvp, sm/ruin is just infinitely better. our warlocks didnt go ds/ruin until they had everyting farmed and were just raiders.
---
Beat me to it. Plenty of fights that fury can't go all out on for these very reasons. Especially in the future.
---
Back in original vanilla, I played a hunter. I was about 14-15 years old and pretty bad at WoW, but I loved playing.
---
I'll never forget the time I did a Gnomeregan on my hunter while I was still leveling. My parents didn't let me play for long stretches of time, so I wasn't able to do many dungeons leveling up. But my parents were gone for the night and I was going to do this whole dungeon. I was so excited!
---
We get in, and after a bit the group leader tells us we are supposed to jump down. As I had no experience in dungeons, WoW, or really any video games in general, I followed the group in jumping down without a second thought. I did not dismiss my pet.
---
Shortly afterwards, half the dungeon comes running at us and we wipe. I don't remember exactly what was said from the group, but they were incredibly pissed off, lobbed a flurry of insults at me, and kicked me from the group. I remember just sitting there staring at the "You have been removed from the party" for a few minutes and feeling so awful, trying to decide whether or not I just just delete my character as I felt like there was no way for my reputation to recover after this. I actually took a few weeks off of the game after that and still think about it every once and a while 15 years later. This time around I'm playing a warrior, it's very nice not having to worry about my pet getting me into trouble all the time!
---
Ask them again what happens if you get flagged for real money trading and how you would combat that. Because just getting hundreds of gold out of nowhere in classic WoW is certainly fishy and would almost certainly be actioned if spotted by a GM. If your GM posts are real, every gold seller in the world is just going to use the "oh we did a retail transaction"
---
Neither were 6 irl day level 60s, 7 irl day Rag clears, or 10 irl days full pre-BiS geared players.
---
As a tank, healers are always a bitch to find. Been doing Maraudon over the last week, usually takes 30minutes to an hour to put a group together. Seems nobody is doing Maraudon, the almost only lfg about it I see is people selling boosts.
---
There is 0 real money trading. They replied saying that is against the ToS. Anything else? You are complaining to the wrong person. I'm just profiting off it with the GMs blessing

Any chance 1 person in that group was locked and entered MC first?  If that happened then the other players would get locked to that person's when they enter

My favourite place imust be Winterspring. When I first started playing, I had the paper game guide with me - I looked for highest level zone, and it was Winterspring. Seeing how slow leveling was, Winterspring acted as unobtainable goal - one that was, suprisingly, eventually obtained. I can't really describe what I felt when, after so many months, for the first time I laid my eyes upon snow hills of Winterspring. Let's just call it "a feeling of long journey nearing completion". 
---
With its isolation and emptiness, it was suprisingly peaceful. Especially that... it was actually during BC. With Outland in-game, there was nothing to look for in a vanilla 58+ zone. For me, it became a symbol of glory that was lost, an element of past long lone, a reminder of what once was and never will be again... except that it IS again, right now, in form of Classic. Gone are the days when I would visit Winterspring in retail, to experience that nostalgia - now I can see Winterspring alive, a dream of something I never actually saw with my own eyes, even as a young teen, those many years ago. 
---
I could continue writing this, alas, they don't give extra points for the quality of comment ;)
---
What? I'm going to stay far away from retail.
---
Teldrassil. It just feels like home.

Pretty sure those +34 green lens of what ever are pre-raid bis for quite a few classes. My locks loves his green lens of shadow
---
No. Even if i would do that and pick my favorite mount i wouldnt be flying around because my favorite mounts arent flying miunts. And not just because im anti flying i just think they look worse. I only use flying mounts when i eant to actually fly. Otherwise i stick to my ground pvp mounts
---
plan for the future, weaponsmithing. be ready to get your tbc axes or maces ;p
---
I get that they can be sold on the AH. I'm just not the type to selfishly roll on someone's upgrade for personal gain. I also take solace in the fact that the top responses to this thread reflect that community spirit.
---
My claim is that you're posting this in an attenpt to find validation over a meaningless, vapid opinion in a community where it's very popular spout it.
---
I know that nobody likes getting caught masturbating, but at least try to be intellectually honest about it. Why else would you make this post?
---
Also, if you're in a group of 5 people and one of them disagrees over how you should roll on a drop, that doesn't make it an unpopular opinion if 4/5 people agree on how something should be rolled upon. Your point doesn't even make sense.
---
I've also had very different experiences. Most of the time people do roll for boes in my groups, especially low value ones. That's besides the point though.
---
My core point is that putting Unpopular opinion before a post is nothing more then masturbatory and posts like this actively degrade the quality of discussion in a given subreddit. 
---
These types of posts are usually indicative of a subreddit either going downhill very fast or already being below sea level in terms of quality

"You shall not farm!" - Gandilf, probably

Have you noticed it being extremely unbalanced? You would be able to tell more than the stats that are old and unreliable
---
Yes, you to not waste raid time. Warlocks were kind enough to use the max rank soulstone on you to get you off the ground.
---
&gt; I‚Äôm 60, raiding, my friend is highs 20s.
---
I just switch servers to play with a friend and his guild. I am the 20s guy in this situation. Under no circumstances do I expect my friend to just drop what he's doing and help me level, because honestly, the exp hit I would take from him being in group would probably slow me down lol.
---
If he wants to offer to carry me through Deadmines or WC, sure, I'll take some loot, but it's like you said, until I hit 50s (and even after) I don't expect them to want to do anything for me.
---
A lot of "fools" are willing to learn, the problem is how the general community approaches teaching them. 
---
Sometimes people forget this is a game, and that the people on the other end are players that have lives and have never played before and are genuinely learning everything for the first time. 
---
I have had very few instances where the "fool" or the "noob" did not change their attitude, learn their mistakes, and start performing better within 20 minutes. I have met plenty of "pros" or "veterans" that honestly would be better off deleting the game, though. 
---
*Some can't be taught, many can't be changed, but the vast majority are always looking to grow and adapt to circumstances to better themselves, if you give them the chance.*
---
The first character I ever made was NE, so I gotta say, this is my fucking spot.

---
I would argue that in the majority of cases, for most players, the value of a boe to someone in the group who can equip it to upgrade their gear is actually less than the market value of the boe.  This is partly because of a certain subset of the playerbase who are prepared to spend way more on upgrades from the auction house than the average players, think twinks or just alts of power-players.  It's also partly because the likelihood of a boe dropping with optimal itemisation for a player at that particular level is very low, they would be better off selling the item and buying something better suited to them.
---
Because of this, if you encourage the behaviour of needing on boes as upgrades, and calling people ninjas for needing them to sell you will be producing a net loss of value to the group as a whole, because people will need on items which are viable, but not optimal, and feel obliged to wear them - less they be called a ninja.
---
YEaH wHAt a faT aSs!

Yea IF on  stalagg-US was packed last night.  Gives me hope that there will be a future for the alliance there still
---
You're intentionally playing devil's advocate? "Technically you are allowed to trade gold..." is not the same as "You are permitted to trade gold in Game X in exchange for gold in Game Y".
---
If you make a gold trade in Classic that trips RMT detection and you are subsequently banned, you won't be able to cite a gold trade in BFA which happened coincidentally in the same timeframe as evidence to over turn it.

finally come back for the last guy

"Instance" means it's separate from the rest of the world, you get your own 5 man, 10 man, or 40 man version of it.
---
Dungeon and instance are interchangeable, it's just that there are some dungeons with multiple entrances (like mara, strat, dire maul). It's all the same instance. All the same dungeon.
---
Versus something like Scarlet Monastery, every portal is a different dungeon and different instance, they aren't connected.
---
You can clear all of Dire Maul by going in any one of the 4 different entrances. You can also summon people. If you reset Dire Maul, the entire place resets.
---

technically they could, but if we do that don't you think that's just really scraping the barrel? the don't have the same visceral, impactful connection to draenei like belves have with, let's say, the withered. they look, act and positionate themselves outside draeneis most of time.

Why do you care?  You need to ask yourself that.  If you haven't noticed the game being terrible to play, then why would you care?  If it is terrible to play and you hate every moment of it, then your answer is to simply move servers, since you were starting over anyway.  But if you haven't even noticed until someone told you, why does it matter?
---
Your opinion means nothing. The same way my opinion means nothing.
---
All there is is that i asked if it was ok to trade my retail gold for classic gold and was told by a GM that it was ok. I have muple GMs telling me that its ok. Once again. Your opinion means nothing and mine means shit to. All in all I asked a GM and 3 told me it was ok. This isn't a post telling you to do what I'm doing. This is a post that Game masters told me I could.

Im a mage and at some aoe spots mages dont kill eachother. Its just too much hassle.

But sometimes they cheap shot ya and that starts a never ending battle where no one gets to farm anymore.

2 minutes isn't much time when you're standing around.

People here defending using rank 1 ress like really? You are raiding and cant invest 2g on your own character that will have increased rank ress for the rest of Classic. Guess some people are just living on extreme poverty living off mage water.
---
I disagree. I think that‚Äôs really cool and adds to the immersion of the world.
---
&gt;Tribal or Elemental?
---
Check the WoWhead guide: https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/leatherworking-classic-wow-1-300
---
Look at the items you can craft, find which ones you like more and pick that one.
---
Just keep in mind that some of the recipes may be incredibly hard to get. 
---
&gt;I'm a tad confused and don't want to make the wrong choice as once I choose there's no turning back unless I completely start over.
---
Basically just pick what you think you will use more, there's no real wrong answer because druids can tank/DPS/heal and no one set will cover all the bases.
---
&gt;I plan to raid, but still unsure whether I want to stay in feral spec or go boomkin, depending on what's more desirable for raiding.
---
You will likely asked to be a healer.
---
this is classic, i love you for posting this, super big congrats on that book!
---
How high were you
---
Is there a better tanking weapon than thrash blade, before any bis?
---
Elwynn Forest!
---
Pallies shouldn't roll on Mageblade over core mage/locks tbh, it's a massive upgrade for them vs minor upgrade for Pallies, BIS aside.
---
This is usually how it goes. 
---
Opener -&gt; Blink -&gt; Poly -&gt; Pyroblast -&gt; Frostbolt -&gt; Nova -&gt; Death
---
High enough. And that‚Äôs all that matters
---
No, frankly I think your "evidence" of GM posts is an easily created or edited screenshot that is only worth as much as the word of any random anonymous person on the internet. On top of that, the inherent risk of what you are claiming is allowed with flimsy evidence goes much farther than just being scammed.
---
They gotta buff up too please help them, costs you nothing.
---
I‚Äôm fucking cackling. Thanks for being the first thing on reddit that has actually made me audibly laugh in a while.
---
Also, now I can‚Äôt wait to get home and watch Living with Yourself.
---
Its a little more difficult but solo farming can still be done. Your SB might hit for way less dmg but that never was the effecient way to farm anyways. You have imp VW just dot and wand. Your imp works fine as well.
---
Just dont try to solo farm dungeons with this build and you will be alright
---
I mean yeah, but is it worth it right now with no honor system? Surely better off just smashing out 60 with a full pve spec, obtaining pre bis or raid gear and then dedicating to pvp at a later date when it matters. 
---
Cool idea though, just a thought.
---
With that spec your better off using swords, hemo is great for slow weapons not so much so for dagger specs.
---
This is why I refuse any invites for content I'm not suited for. Sometimes people ask you to tank even though you're too low level out of desperation, because they want to make some progress rather than none. But without fail, they start blaming you when things go badly.

Noob question since I just started the game about a week ago. Does WoW classics receive updates/new contents? Or is it like everything we have right now will be all there ever will be?
---
What in the actual fuck lmao
---
&gt; ran back to LoS it into the group. In the meantime, three ranged dps started casting
---
Yep, it's WoW
---
yeah, this. as long as the green lens is an appropriate modifier, it's far and away better then Eye of Theradras.
---
Of course 16 hours a day is bad...that's why I'm saying practice self control and not let it get to that point. If you have to drop everything that's good, and "demanding more" then that sounds like a problem to me. You're never going to be able to enjoy great things like wow cause you just quit them if they're "too good".  You say everyone has "self control issues"...well you work on them...don't be scared of your issues, work on them..
---
I think the best part about blacksmithing as a shaman is the fear immunity trinket(no specilization), although you can also craft the Invulnerable Mail as an armorsmith and Nightfall as an axesmith.
---
I always imagined Darnassus being higher up in the trees with rope bridges and huge branches to get around. Maybe grant everyone slowfall to get back down to the ground shops. It is still my favorite city, but I wish it had a more unique design.
---
UC is fine until you do the BfA intro quest, then it is just a blob of blight. Same thing with Teldrassil, it's only a smoldering ruin once you start BfA at level 110. They still need it to be the NE starting area after all.
---
What are you trying to compensate?
---
&gt;*a boe dropping with optimal itemisation*
---
We're talking about a leveling upgrade not min/maxing at endgame...
---
&gt;*you will be producing a net loss of value to the group as a whole*
---
That's bullshit. An immediate upgrade for a player, especially in the middle of a dungeon, is a positive gain for that dungeon group.

Any warlocks care to chime in? I don't see how that's possible. What is there some magical "no summons past here" invisible wall I'll cross if I go with a group in DM N and start going up the path to the library in DM E? Doesn't make sense.
---
edit: I did some googling and found this thread: https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/dire-maul-summons/340970/14

It's either a bug or intentional and I didn't know about it. From the sounds of it you can't even summon if I was inside and standing right next to the warlock. Sorry about coming at you like that, good discussion. Hope you saw where you were wrong as well, it's all the same instance. Blizz did something fucky with the summoning which wasn't there on private servers but possibly is how it was in retail vanilla
---
Too much rage. Use that rage instead to get into sweeping strikes and WW faster then D stance demo shout and tab sunder/revenge as needed. Thunderclap just isn‚Äôt worth it but that‚Äôs just my opinion.
---
Wait, do they drop from the Succubus as well? wowhead just has them on the demons
---
I mean I agree lol, i think belves got way more focus in BC, I mean just look at the cover art haha. Also kael'thas is a major villain and the end zone if the expansion is quel'danas and the sunwell lol but I do still think of the broken, and akamas story as a part of the draeneis as well so I dont see them as non-existent.

There's nothing misleading. I confirmed from game masters that it is OK to trade your gold between retail and classic. It's just do it at your own risk

Another amazing aoe attack that is on its own separate cooldown is one of the rewards from collecting those crystals in ungoro. The one that does 500 dmg in a 5 yard radius. Saved me a good 3 holy nova casts

This is actually not a humble brag. I have been playing Classic on pservers since 2016, and in vanilla, so I already got my nostalgia fill and then some. I was pretty hardcore. But i can‚Äôt balance being hardcore vs. casual, it has to be one or the other. I considered getting epic 60 gear etc., this is actually a pretty hard moment for me.
---
My bad I have another post where I explain a bit better. Thought this was it.  I've tanked for 15 yrs, playing a spriest now. Tanking to me is a cakewalk, it's only hard cuz you depend on your dps not to be dumb. With a good group tanking is absolutely easy. It's easy to get into and be alright at, its hard to be really good is what I'm meaning to say in a sense.

Watch this video. Specifically the parts of Stormwind, Orgrimmar, heck even Stratholme. What happens to them would happen to Silvermoon because they're setup to only be seen from 1 angle, like a children's popup book.
---
I agree with letting them buy the roll off you, but considering that the gold gained from selling goes directly towards account upgrades means they benefit from it just as much as you do, unlike with bop dungeon gear where greeding and needing correctly should be followed to a T. All need just eliminates a ninja

The nooks behind the emerald portals where the dragons of nightmare spawn. Back in TBC my guild would do a weekly guild wide hide and seek tournament, They would choose a zone and everyone would find spots to hide from the officer core. This was before anyone was aware of target macros. The five longest lasting players would get prizes with a grand prize if you were not found before the deadline. On three separate occasions I won the grand prize by hiding in the little nooks behind those portals. After the third win I felt a little guilty and told the guild about them, they were promptly banned from use.
---
Molten Core. Nothing like the loot dopamine and chilling with guildies.
---
If we're talking vanilla, Duskwood. If TBC is an option, see my name! :)
---
Why is that relevant.
---
Yup, Loganaar is Cenarion Circle so uhhh go do Silithus quests before training anything I guess
---
The portal could still be there and you could have the 2 zones attached to Eastern Kingdoms and proportionally correct. But they didn't, they put them in another part of the game world and oversized them.

I love Blackrock Mountain, from the depths of the Molten Core to the Peak of Blackwing Lair

This would be awesome! I cannot afford extra expenses right now. :(
---
My favorite place in Classic so far has been that snazzy boat ride in Feralas :)
---
Without a GM name your post has absolutely zero credibility. So why waste your time trolling us with this if you refuse to offer any source?
---
Not everyone has friends. Hell if i had friends that played games like wow id be in heaven. All they play is apex,overwatch,fornite. They cba to play a game with time investments but i see many casuals are like that

Cries in thunderbluff
---
Sorry if I‚Äôm being dumb but how are his victims able to communicate with him? Is he somehow killing people of the same faction?
---
Was kinda suprised at all the strung up corpses left at the gallows near Duskwood. One moment, youre in the fantasy wonderland of Elwynn forest, next youre wondering where you took a wrong turn
---
Its so calming
---
For me, locating the auction house in darnassus is a process of trial and error, despite the fact that it‚Äôs never moved and despite the fact that I‚Äôve been playing this game for 14 years
---
***BAAAT-CHOO!***
---
Wuh hoo. . .
---
You still won't tell me why its relevant to have a GM name over the response
---
Yea these macros were clonky when I first started but now im in almost full raid gear and theyre second nature to me.
---
specifically of the bear type ;)
---
Dun Morogh. I like snow.
---
Yes, that's what I meant.
---
Don't ever play like that. That's burnout 101. Enjoy the grind or don't grind at all.
---
&gt;  didn't use a /s or explain the joke at all.
---
Fuck off back to America. The rest of the world isn't stupid enough to need everything literally spelled out for them.
---
You have a double negative, so let me know if I misunderstood you.
---
But essentially, by not say it is against their rules, they have permitted it, for the time being.  It‚Äôs possible that will change.  But either it is legal or it is illegal, by their ToS.  If it was not allowed, it would be a simple matter of saying so.
---
Hence why I take care of heals lol
---
Nope. That's also why I'm completely fine with my 60% mount even at 60 and won't be buying an epic mount for months. No real rush to go anywhere at 60
---
Stranglethorn Vale! So many fond memories of questing being interrupted by all out battles between Horde and Alliance.
---
Actually laughed embarrassingly loud irl
---
Can someone break down being run though a dungeon by like a level 60?  
---
I understand you lose some experience, but like what are we talking about? Half? 90%?
---
 I was in a. Group the other night and someone mentioned the other night and 2 of the people were talking and said that as long as the mobs were ‚Äúskulls‚Äù to the lower level toon, grouping with a 60 wasn‚Äôt that bad of an exp loss, especially when you consider their speed
---
I feel like this should have the flavour text: "You think you do, But you don't"
---
Due to time constraints I will almost certainly never raid (2 hour sessions are my absolute max). I have a very foggy understanding of end game armor, but what is the highest level of armor I would be able to get? My guess is the dungeon sets (my guess being the name indicates no raid required).
---
When a mage can easily keep a melee at bat with nothing they can do, it kind of doesn‚Äôt matter. The player is really good, it‚Äôs just this couldn‚Äôt have been done by any other class is my point.
---
The only real problem area is the Tempest Keep dungeons and raid. 
---
Could be solved with teleporters though. I always hated flying to those dungeons anyway. 'Am I going the right way?' 'Aw shit wrong dungeon!' On a slow ass flying mount it was a pain a lot of the time.
---
It's not just a map edit for lore, they'd be changing the shape of the north because the gameplay area itself is too big.
---
This too. Sulfuras will cost you 7k+ gold.
---
Well guess I need to do that now. I‚Äôll get back to you with update xD
---
Top of Org Bank. Cant stop riding in circles.. can always a full BIS character flexing up there.
---
Yup, my server's subreddit is still empty. Feelsbadman
---
It is bad...nothing to do except Ony/Mc and wait for weekly reset. More than half of my friends that were so excited for ‚Äúbetter, harder‚Äù wow already quit...
---
Mate the prices are dropping hard as fuck what are you on about?
---
Ive began to enjoy ashenvale for some reason
---
I played a lot of BFA until Classic dropped and had no interest and did very few islands. I was able to keep up well enough with out them. Now I am not even sure if I will log in to check out the new raid.
---
I THINK the joke is that DM=Deadmines and not Dire Maul
---
I'm not sure If it's possible but you can look into doing Mara solos. Minor speed on boots and dot princess and run. I do it on my holy priest just fine, even though it takes like 5 or 6 min a kill lol. Still easily 20g and up an hour if you can do tinker as well
---
That server has been announced on Wowhead though: https://classic.wowhead.com/news=295799/layered-realms-update-for-october-22nd
---
Though no EU servers have been announced, but it's already happening.
---
Darkshire for that aoe farming!
---
It doesnt matter what color it is, if you are gonna use it as gear and not gold, you roll need.
---
If a skullflame shield or stockade paulderons drop I will need the shit out of that roll &amp; equip it in a heartbeat.
---
[http://www.wowclassicbis.com/](http://www.wowclassicbis.com/)
---
You should be able to acquire anything in the 2 (pre-raid) section. We're not in Phase 2 yet but the gear added in phase 2 comes from Dire Maul which they released early, so that will show all the blue drops you should hunt for.
---
Can't help you with that :/ Everything's fine on my old-ish Xperia Z5
---
What is ST?
---
I bandage the locks so I dont waste mana if there is a chance to during or after a fight. 
---
I've had a person criticize my use of bandages on the lock by telling to me Lrn 2 Heal. 
---
I just ignore morons like that. Love the locks tho. Fuck yea ill heal them
---
Serves 2 purpose..
---
1. Keep the alliance and people that didn't buy the expansion out.
---
2. To teleport you to Outlands where the 2 zones are actually located in the game space.
---
Just like to boat to the draenei islands. (Though it doesn't do a good job of keeping the horde out.)
---
How is allowed not the same as permitted in this context?
---
Computers make mistakes and that‚Äôs why they have a system to rebuttal.    They said there was no support for lost gold/items, they did not say they would not overturn a ban that resulted from this trade.
---
Someone should burn that place down
---
More like tricking yourself into thinking it's fun. If you do archaeology for 10 hours there's just no way you can think it's fun without deluding yourself, it's all about that dopamine chase of when you get what you want and it's highly addictive.
---
Pro tip set your hearth to gadgetzan as an ally mage over level 30. Easy access anywhere. (I actually have mine set to feather moon now for DM but it's nearby anyways).
---
Every time I've tried this in the past I feel like I'm 2 feet tall, as if the camera is sitting at my waist.
---
trinket menu
---
Can confirm. I got that message about Onyxia when my guild started the encounter, and that was before I was even attuned
---
Blackrock Mountain. It feels like the endgame of an rpg. Not over the top insane, but just a cool mountain full of dungeons, dragons, lava, and elementals.
---
Going from arms to fury is fine.
---
I made the choice to go arms -&gt; prot -&gt; fury for a few reasons:
---
1) get to experience playing with classic prot talents
---
2) get to spam dungeons without having half a tree of talents going to waste... and instead getting sexy 12 rage sunders etc 
---
3) get to compensate for running dungeons as a tank under max level and undergeared 
---
I respecced prot at level 53 for dungeon spamming and plan to respec fury in a month (or earlier) for raiding.
---
IMO, show up in the spec you wanna be geared for. If you want 1h weapons, raid as fury regardless of your gear. The bosses will die either way, but you will make it clear what spec you prefer.
---
Yea that‚Äôs a smart idea, but he‚Äôll probably enjoy himself more with his idea.
---
The Badlands
---
Good job guys!
---
Eve has a massive player base but only one chribba. It is a lot harder to be chribba than you think.
---
If it's what you truly enjoy above all else, pursue it, plenty of other addictions that are a lot worse for your health, drinking, smoking, and things that are more expensive.. like drinking.. or smoking.. or magic the gathering. Don't worry bout it, live ur life
---
How would you feel about your surgeon saying "well this is my first open heart surgery but I've stitched a couple of wounds before"?
---
But by cata didn't they make it so you only needed the current xpac?
---
Yes, there's a dungeon set colloquially referred to as '[T0](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/tier-0-dungeon-set-1-overview-classic-wow#tier-0-set-names),' that you can obtain through dungeons. As far as the best gear you can obtain, there are a number of blues and even BoE epics that you can get your hands on that are better.
---
&gt;They changed it because people like you don't know basic economics.
---
I hate to break it to you, but loot isn't just about economics. I know economics, but fuck economics when the game is intended a certain way.
---
&gt;They changed it because people like you don't know basic economics. They changed it because you are wrong, not because you're right.
---
No they didn't. They changed it because of people like you needing items that other people could immediately use just because it was BoE and you wanted to sell it.
---
&gt;I don't play retail but in the years I played WoW Needing never soulbound an item. Because that eliminates the purpose of being Bind on Equip.
---
No it doesn't. They still kept the ability to have it BoE if you clicked "Greed" on it. That means anyone it's an immediate upgrade for was allowed to click need and equip the item since it can't be sold being soulbound. Those who wanted to sell it were *forced* to hit greed in order for it not to be soulbound.
---
&gt;I don't play retail but in the years I played WoW Needing never soulbound an item.
---
It was introduced in the Cataclysm expansion in 4.2.0. [Source](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Soulbound).
---
&gt;What Blizzard did was create PERSONAL LOOT, which invalidates the entire thing, because in that system the computer just rolls and you don't ever even see the BoE item you would be demanding to me to pass to you.
---
&gt;The personal loot system emulates my way of thinking, not yours.
---
Personal loot system pretty much proves me right. They didn't want people to be fighting for loot if everyone can get an **immediate** upgrade. Do they give you extra gold to buy whatever upgrade? No. 
---
The Needing a BoE item becoming soulbound certainly proves me the most right, since that means anyone who selects need must use or vendor the item. And vendoring items is far less useful than auctioning it. So it's prioritizing the ability to use loot over making gold in the AH.
---
What are you rambling about lmao. If the rolls are tied, the game will invisibly roll for both of you again. Whoever has a higher roll wins.
---
You should respec to prot five minutes before raid. Tanking dungeons in Arms or Fury is fine. Thrash blade is really good until you get mirah song. Use that after getting it.
---
21-18=3
---
Wow has three letters. 
---
Coincidence?
---
 I think not.
---
Eve has a massive player base but only one chribba. It is a lot harder to be chribba than you think. He can do it only because he has more in game currency that he would never bother scamming anyone.
---
I got Mature Blue Dragon Sinew today. There only seems to be one other on my faction which is priced at 550g at AH (and doesn't seem to sell). Anyone knows how much these go for? Give or take..
---
For the Horde!
---
&gt; I understand you lose some experience, but like what are we talking about? Half? 90%?
---
95%.
---
If mobs are gray for one player in party - rest would be getting ~5% exp.  
---
But it's possible to compensate for this, level 60 just need to kill x20 times faster!
---
I (ALiance) saw a horde hunter strugling with an Elite, and because he was not on my kos list, i desided to help him.
---
After my attack on the mob, he wrote something like "och, only a fool would fight such unfair fight" and disapeared .... 
---
The hunter started to shot on me ....
---
It was his epic quest -.- The mob despawns when somebody else helps, and i totaly forgot it .
---
Because he continuesly atacked me directly after (undertandable) i killed him too ...
---
I wrote a few /sorry afterwards, but still ... i ruined his epic quest, and killed him in selfdefence afterwards.
---
In vanilla the top guild on the server basically hired our guild to protect them from another horde raid on one of them. Told us they have some "scouts" over there and knew horde did too and set up an agreement, probably something like flasks or something. It was the one in Duskwood area and when it popped up they messaged us and we gathered all we had and luckily it was right before our raid time. We stood at bottom of the path and they were right, the hordes top guild was en route to the boss. Fought them off since they came separate and by the time they realized we were just a distraction and bodyguards the guild killed the boss. Was super fun. Look forward to guilds doin stuff like that again.
---
I'll play retail again if silvermoon becomes relevant
---
In ferales on my fire mage. Ganking horde from a top of some vines while they're completely helpless.
---
Thunder Bluff, best place for afk gold making by far
---
For pvp and grinding? Priest (shadow to heal dungeons and help kill stuff for killing mobs/pvp) with a mage as a secondary option. 
---
For dungeon spam? Druid or warrior tank for quicker groups.
---
I like Grid2 for raid frames and Shadowed Unit Frames for general use.
---
Right, not the tank and some people, at least a couple healers and DPS, need to be geared but not the whole raid.
---
Druid! Dual stealth and heals... As well you can fill any role for dungeons. Only minor setback is loot competition.
---
I love this
---
He had a second account with a character named angwespy.
---
Druid. You can heal or tank instances. Plus you can both stealth.
---
That bank is lowkey a jinchuriki
---
Druid by a mile. No weapon competition, some gear comp, both have stealth, druid heals rogue, and a tank is a huge plus to have. Double stealth though...
---
We have 2 full Raid teams with 40 man + and we are splitting in 4 20 man raids for ony
---
So,  no not all raiding guilds are like that
---
Honestly don't know why you're being downvoted. This is totally a valid mentality to have. I understand those groups who want to be as efficient as possible sure but vanilla content isn't HARD so that isn't necessary unless you're aiming to be competitive with other guilds (also totally okay if you enjoy that).
---
Druid! Double stealth is amazing
---
Most of the city is actually empty space with no 3d models. Like not even floors, it's just designed to look bigger by making you walk around empty space.
---
Is there a build that uses Hand of Edward the Odd? I k is it‚Äôs a cool item for pvp I‚Äôm assuming, I just can‚Äôt understand why it sells for so much.
---
Blink, sheep, and frost nova are crutches.  Get gud mage, lrn 2 not aggro.
---
Sure, but then I'd have to play a druid
---
Hemo is an instant strike, so it'll do more damage with a Slow Weapon since it couldn't give a finch's leftmost toe about swing speed. If memory serves, it's best with a Slow Mainhand, Fast Offhand
---
they aren't tho, mage and rogue is 50/50 with cds, without its a free mage win
---
200-500g depending on demand is pretty normal.
---
I saw 4-5 up on our AH for 200g about 3~ weeks ago, now there's only one for 500g. 
---
Because of how rare/unique the item is, it really depends on who wants it, and how desperately they want it.
---
Darkshore?
---
yeah it'd be more useful with lots of pulls though, fear juggling and what not.
---
Make sure that your shift-4 isn't key bound to anything. I had a lot of macro issues until I found this out.
---
Winterspring. I love it. I enjoy the purple filter the zone has, and how the tranquil beauty of the pale white snow is contrast by the demonic corruption of Darkwhisper Gorge. When the snow starts coming down it really gives you this isolated and yet comfortable feeling that only Dun Morogh could match. Adding onto that is the fact that it's one of the very last zones you quest in before you hit the level cap. There's also the frostsaber grind if you're a member of the Alliance. I love the place.
---
I second this. I swapped at lvl 55 for a change up for end lvls, and despite not having all that juicy hit gear (although now I have a good bit) it was still fun and fresh and I enjoyed the swap. Arms really takes off at 40 with mortal strike, so you could play around with that a bit if you want for a few lvls. Otherwise swap whenever you want.
---
Did you watch the last one with Neil? He constantly interrupted Joe. It was really hard to watch. He‚Äôs so full of himself that it‚Äôs awkward to listen to.
---
Haha, same! Especially Tanaris, that chicken runs for like 25 minutes!  As you get close to Steamwheedle Port and the traffic really starts picking up I was insanely paranoid.  Luckily everyone left me alone and I got my mechanical chicken buddy!
---
I hope you forgot to loot the parchment. Jerk.
---
Not going to lie though, as a veteran player I would be a bit frustrated if my tank was taking the time to mark every  monster in a BFD run. It's BFD.  Granted he sounded pretty toxic.
---
One of my worst experiences in classic was an LBRS run about a month ago with a feral tank. I'll preface it by saying 4 of us were guildies and all very experienced WoW players (tank was a pug). First pull the tank marks every mob, has the hunter trap one, the mage poly one, and we fight them down 1 by 1 by 1. This continues 3 pulls, the tank taking 10-15 seconds to mark every group and study every inch of the pull and continuously cc'ing just about every mob we could. As the healer i probably didn't dip below 90% mana once and never had to drink, at which point the mage asks in a pretty polite manner if we could maybe speed it up and not CC EVERY mob in the dungeon. No answer. After the tank finishes marking the next pull (and stands idle for another 10 seconds) mage goes ahead and sheep pulls assuming thats what the tank wanted. The tank legitimately freaks out over not being able to pull (despite the group dying super easily) calling the mage a retail retard baby child or something of that sort and a few other insults that i can't really remember. I went ahead and just removed him from the group for that toxicity.
---
I hate the notion that the tank gets to completely decide the rate at which a dungeon goes. It should be more of a group decision. We're not trying to spend 2.5 hours in a LBRS run when we were spamming them the day before in sub 45 minutes. 
---
And just to illustrate how slow the tank was moving, we continued clearing without a tank as a 4 man squad while we waited for a replacement without needing to CC and had no issues. Probably legit could've cleared the whole dungeon faster as 4 then with him tanking it for us.
---
idk what archaeology is but i enjoyall grinds I do else I skip them.
---
I would look up a list of your BiS. Usually this is a hodgepodge of armor from different dungeons and craftables. While the dungeon sets are good they are not the best for you. However at some point they will be releasing a .5 tier set that is upgraded from your dungeon set so you may want to collect those anyway. Also keep in mind that a good raid team with MC on farm should be able to complete that in about 2 hours. There are also raid teams that will split MC into two days.  There's also an Onyxia which takes about 20 minutes.
---
&gt;Due to time constraints I will almost certainly never raid (2 hour sessions are my absolute max). 
---
For what it's worth, you can find good guilds that can complete MC in &lt;2hrs so I wouldn't count yourself out just yet.
---
Onyxia is like 20 minutes (+1hr of waiting lol).
---
&gt;I have a very foggy understanding of end game armor, but what is the highest level of armor I would be able to get? 
---
The dungeon sets are the highest 'tier' you can get, but there is better equipment if you want that isn't part of a set.
---
I think you merant to type SW
---
My bf and I played a rouge/druid combo. The stealthing definitely comes in handy when you don't want to fight your way through all the mins or sneak up and gank someone! The loot competition is annoying, but you guys will just have to fight it out! Or take leather working and make your own stuff
---
I don't even blame you for not knowing because it's in the most non-central, nondescript building imaginable
---
10000% agree with you here.
---
Unless you are purposely kiting, you shouldn‚Äôt need them
---
Druid.
---
You can both stealth, he can heal/tank if required, and you guys will both do decent DPS.
---
You‚Äôre soon at lvl to farm Small Flame Sac. Get the Greater Fire protection potion recipe and make bank
---
Perhaps this is true
---
Does questing after 60 give gold instead of xp? I keep hearing divided opinions on this but I fail to see any income.
---
I usually hang back on dps until the tank gets really going, but this is good to know about those sunders, etc.
---
And yeah, hunters can definitely deal with their own off aggro.
---
Cool, thanks a lot for replying. I smashed it up on AH for 450 and I guess I will just leave it there and see if anyone buys it. After a little spamming in /trade, lots of hunters seem interested but not for more than around 200-350 gold.
---
But at age 50 you get your epic house? Right? RIGHT!?!?
---
Is the cast range on fortitude longer than the trade range? You can buff 5 dudes at once with an instant spell at range. It's nowhere near comparable to having to cast for 15 seconds and then run around supplying people with their goods.
---
They aren't at all comparable.
---
Hillsbrad Foothills. Not the best zone, but the world pvp memories from vanilla boost it way up
---
You could probably frame all murders onto your imp.
---
Happy framing!
---
Always loved running Stratholme, given the Arthas story.  Undead side and ‚ÄúLight‚Äù side, great visuals for a great story!
---
The Barrens. 
---
Nothing like the Barrens chat for entertainment when grinding out some levels.
---
After questing in the barrens forever you can finally go south and check what‚Äôs beyond the endless prairie.
---
You‚Äôre treated to an insanely dramatic cliff with an elevator with who knows where it could go. You finally head down and are surrounded by all these insanely large mountains and it only gets better when you realize your main base of free wind pot is atop one of these
---
R u mad bro
---
&gt;the horde burning it was a favor
---
Wait, what...
---
Actually true
---
That's so cool. I want a healer buddy too! :)
---
According to the loot table on the guide on WoWhead which was written by a former gm. I haven't personally seen one in a box.
---
TB is actually the best city before you get a mount. It's so compact. The only issue is the dismount going between buttes (?), and the risk of falling if you fuck up.
---
I used to play horde but rolled alliance in classic, and I gotta say, IF is pretty great. Definitely my favorite alliance city.
---
It's almost as if what separates the good players is going above what other players are doing.
---
Later on they will be releasing an upgrade to the dungeon set and you can upgrade it to it's better version referred to as "T0.5" or Tier 0.5. 
---
It's likely that there is better gear than either of the dungeon sets but it's a really nice and realistic goal when you can't raid due to time constraints.
---
I don't know what class you play but here is an overview of Tier 0 / dungeon set 1
---
Yea but nobody really cares as long as it's funny and original like this post is, don't be hatin
---
I'm playing Spriest because healing doesn't seem to be in demand like I had hoped. It's actually easier to get in a group when im playing shadow. Doesn't hurt that shadow is ok in dungeons because you get combat breaks to drink
---
haha, sneaky rog!
---
You did the world a favour.
---
Darn doesn't have warlock trainers so they had it coming.  Enjoy your free hearth with no CD.
---
Cuz the raid don‚Äôt start till 8
---
Just another shitty reddit meme beaten to death. It basically means that the username is relevant to whatever comment was made. So because Joe Rogan never shuts the fuck up about DMT, it's *funny* because he said he was LFM DMT.
---
Because red = dead.
---
What's so hard to understand about that?
---
Stats wise or aesthetic ? Because I agree I don‚Äôt like the look of it for whatever reason
---
I guess i made the assumption that playing games with your friends is fun. 
---
I dont want help either i cannot stress that enough. I just want to play wow with my friends who have more time for it than i do. And i think its kind of rude to never make time for your actual friends.
---
By your logic a significant volume of posts on this sub serve no purpose. Maybe he just wanted to get his frustration of his chest and see if it could help drive Blizzard to solve it. Nothing wrong with trying.
---
Also looks like the statue is violating you from behind, and you are having the time of your life.
---
There should be a whole addon of defias. Im tiered of the demonds.
---
Introducing the knew FP-RP-PVP realms....
---
More helpful than someone asking for text replies regarding specific elaborate strategies for content that's existed for 5,447 days and has ample videos on youtube for that you could have searched instead relying on others to spend the time doing what you are too lazy to
---
I second this, I've been up there and that's what it looks like.
---
If you are shadow rotgrip is fairly easy. If dwarf, even easier. Princess is all about staying outside of the rock throw zone. Princess is the longest fight for priests because you cant stand still and cast blast or flay on CD. Instead, keep SWP up and run in circles.
---
But seriously watch a video. Saying that Mara is low GPM is a reflection of the person, not the content. Having each mechanic down is what makes it worthwhile.
---
Eastern and Western Plaguelands. Always love the story of the scourge and the argent dawn.
---
I would love a version of this for wallpaper engine!
---
Ironforge. I am a gnome, and i love hanging out in front of AH saying hello to all the random people, and chatting with them. The social aspect of meeting random new people is always fun! Even if you only speak with them for a shortwhimr
---
Fucking streamers and YouTube man.
---
After midnight on a weeknight
---
Well think about going 26/25 at least.
---
I will offer an alternative perspective, of course my own personal feeling on this and 15 years of experience . I am a fan of LFG as I don‚Äôt have a lot of time every day to play as I would like. that being said I still want to progress and I am able to through this function without having to make my friends repeat stuff they may not feel like doing again and again. Without bothering others I can play at my own pace, I also can help out people trying to catch up or play at there own pace as well. Guilds are an awesome and terrible feature. I don‚Äôt think things should be so reliant on them (I‚Äôm looking at those guilds with ‚Äúcontracts‚Äù completely ridiculous asshats imo) but I do love helping others in my guild and random people when I do have the time to run through content. 
---
In short: LFG is good for those who don‚Äôt have as much time to play and don‚Äôt want to hold others back nor make them repeat content they have played 450 times already.
---
Thousand Needles. I'll never forget watching over my brother's shoulder as he rode a windrider crossing from the barrens into Thousand Needles all those years ago. I had my own copy of WoW in my hands a few hours later but, to my dismay, it would not run on my hand-me-down Compaq  Presario 5000 that got me through thousands of hours of Diablo 2 and I had to squeeze in as much playtime as I could on my mom's computer. In hindsight, it still ran terribly but I was so enthralled I never even noticed.
---
Did you just assume his time zone
---
Badlands. It was the very first ever zone that I saw a level skull mobs and at the same that I realize how big the world is.
---
Just get a QT 3.14 plumper tootie GF that will play WoW classic with you.
---
That sucks. I lost a roll to a warrior on blackcrow. I was using the bow from Mara... Happens man. My only advice is to ask them beforehand if they're going to need it. Based on that you can make a decision to continue.
---
The main reason I was wondering is that Stinging Viper does more damage than Wingblade, so it didn't know how bad it would hurt me not wielding it in my MH.
---
UC is the equivalent. It is in East, while Org and TB are in Kalimdor.
---
Alliance has IF and SW in east, and Darn in Kalimdor.
---
Lol, he did.
---
I mean you're paying 1g60s for 1 stack of horse piss from the vendor, 1g for 6 stacks of crystal spring? Sign me up.

Chicken gives a 5% haste buff to party occasionally, sappers do tons of damage, one of the best shields requires engi, rez cables. Engi is a must-have profession
---
Agreed. You can swap out another mage for a warrior with ravager, too, if he's careful about aggro and where he stands. A hunter can help a lot, too, he can even replace the warlock with his pet - plus hell be able to pick off stragglers and kite any mobs that get away. If you go that route, a resto druid is great for casting thorns on the pet so that it holds aggro a little better while pulling - that way hots can roll on it, too. Rogues are great for CCing mobs that might aggro your healer, as is bound to happen in a newer group. 
---
Of course newer groups should pull slower, probably one pack at a time while they get their bearings with the spellcleave meta. After the hunter pulls, the paladin could probably get aggro on the mobs - his high armor allows him to take lots of physical damage hits. The other members of the group should focus down one mob at a time to slowly eliminate threats and reduce incoming damage on the paladin. 
---
That's the ideal spellcleave for beginners, imo. Pally, druid, hunter, warrior, rogue. QED.
---
It was possible in vanilla, i used to split pull packs in MC
---
IIRC for priest:  
---
+heal is 1  
---
+int is 1.16  
---
+spirit is 0.83   
---
+mp5 - 3.5  
---
And stamina is useless.  
---
So +50 healing is better than +20 int/+20 spirit, for example.  
---
P.S. There's addon Pawn, that allow you to enter this values and it will show you +% upgrade in item tooltips.
---
In any even semi serious guild, if the mages dont have sappers, you're not in the raid spot.
---
Mages are your defense against losing your world buffs on the way to raid, and perfectly complement their kit on any AoE fight.
---
Yes because you can make comparisons between widely different things as long as there's a link...
---
I'm just making the point that there are some things better left unsaid, as not to make people worried for no reason. Just don't walk into a group saying "oh yeah this might be a terrible run guys but don't worry", just don't say anything about it ?
---
*miss*
---
Why? You like to have people in your group who make same mistakes over and over and then are either indifferent about it or blame others?
---
Allianz hier venoxis!
---
Oh I was thinking about slash roll and not the need greed rolls
---
Is there a list of weapons I should be seeking as a level 32 rogue or is this something I should even worry about? I've had the same weapons for several levels now and I don't know where to find upgrades.
---
It wasnt Bis before DM. the swords are only BIS if you have the agi enchant which doesnt even exist yet.
---
Because they changed shit? That's a stupid reason lol.
---
Retail sucks right now because they killed the community and because the writing/story is absolute trash this expansion.

How do you get to 15% Crit?

This seems theoretically accurate but I‚Äôd be surprised if someone got 75% of the your dps estimate on average with the gear level described. I just think they either won‚Äôt live long enough or they‚Äôll have some sort of resistance/level difference.

I stopped mid cata, what is tree form??
---
I feel like I'm having the experience quite a bit even vs mobs 3-4 levels below me.
---
The first sign of someone having issues is that they were stuck in SM for weeks and didn't have ravager üòÇ
---
I mean that leveling grind tho, its kinda painful.
---
Not worth it for new players who dont know what they're doing until level 40. Arguably not even worth it for people who do until ~33.
---
Not worth it except during the middle of the night on any moderately populated server due to being contested, especially now that all but a few servers are layered.
---
Mage AoE grinding does not work in the middle stages of a server's lifecycles. Arguably, it really only works for the first few mages on any server launch.
---
You're not going to be leveling like Joker.
---
Barrens, do I need to say more?
---
8 Legged Freaks was this cheesy horror movie that came out in 2002 that had a scene like this. Makes sense.
---
Only if you've been smart with your gold since level 20 and haven't bought the unnecessary skills or fancy items
---
That place is called kelethin and this game already stole too much IP.
---
Wait. This isn't what we are supposed to do?
---
You have no idea about tanking. 99 percent of the players expect the tank to mark and pull etc. Know the route.
---
That is both factions. No alliance has 1v1ed me in weeks, but I've been triple teamed and gank a lot. The only 1v1s I had I started over mining areas.
---
I have never played the game in such a peaceful state as it is right now. It‚Äôs honestly not great imo. You SHOULD feel fear if you‚Äôre over-extending yourself in PvP territory yet I see these warlocks dotting 3 mobs and living to 5% hp/mana fearlessly. Same with aoe mages. 
---
If I don‚Äôt think someone has a healthy respect for contested zones on a PvP server - I‚Äôm going to kill them.

then you doing it wrong.

It's still early and classic will be here for a long time.  As much as it sucks losing all that progress, if long term you're going to be unhappy with your server/class/race/whatever, it's better to just reroll now and get it over with.  You don't need to be 60 and fully geared the second phase 2 drops.  The raids and pvp will still be there when you catch up.
---
Can I ask how the warrior ability revenge works in this version? Is it the massively damage buffed version?
---
I recall it doing a lot of damage at some point during vanilla wow after a patch. Rank 1 went from like 14 damage to 100 damage.
---
Which version does classic have ?
---
Wailing Caverns

I‚Äôve done some of the most addicting drugs once. Couldn‚Äôt play WoW only once.

I don't know how much of this is real or a joke but I hope you're doing ok. Relationships are important but there's no rule saying you can't spend 5 years absolutely slamming away at WoW before getting back into the dating scene.
---
Just go to any Expert First aid trainer and read what he will tell you.  
---
It work for all professions - when you have max level skill, they will tell you where to find next trainer.
---
Also stitching wounds and heart surgery are 2 completely other things.
---
I like to polymorph pig them and /pat a couple times and call them piggy. And then I just leave them alone.

yeah i dunno I haven't been having much troubles with FD+trap on my hunter alt. Only level 42 but it hasn't been a problem for me.
---
Pet responsiveness on the other hand.... yikes
---
just find a dps warrior in your guild and become besties with them and make them tank everything for you.
---
Or just farm dm East until you get enough gold to buy the book. I did this in about 70 runs, whereas farming the book drop would likely take hundreds of runs.
---
Uh.. no.. I wasn't part of the raid so I wasn't in their group. They just told the guild to wait in Org. Even my buddy was there but we weren't grouped. I was sitting on Org bank when they did the countdown of 5mins. After they did it, I didn't have the buff and neither did anyone around me I clicked on. My buddy invited me to her group and I transferred to her layer where everyone had the buff, including her.
---
I know how the buff works. I think you're misunderstanding what I said originally. Also I wasn't trying to be hostile toward you, so I don't understand the hostility in your reply.

Hydramist also has a video of him solo'ing Maraudon without gear as Shadow spec.

Ah addons.  My auctioneer sets the price to match mine or undercut market automatically.
---
I'm not sure I understand your point. Warriors and druids are the most effective 5 man tank classes.  If you rolled either of those classes you should aim to master all aspects of it. It makes you a more flexible and effective player.
---
Other classes either have shitty tanking or flat out can't do it so they aren't relevant to the discussion.
---
Take a Feral friend with dorns and you will do it easily. (he is not allowed to walk but he can heal himself)

Did you listen to countdown to classic? There was a 20minute discussion stating exactly this. If everything is good, then it‚Äôs all average.
---
Trust me in like 1 year when you actually do more than 40 minutes of mc a week this game isnt half as bad. Atleast then you almost got 3hours of raidtime per week plus ZG which you will lern to hate more than everything after youve done it more than once. :)

It's for resto druids. Their healing form.

This actually happened to a friend of mine. It's messed up. So guy 1 didn't have a functional creditcard at the time so he tells his new employer to pay his first salary into guy 2's bank account instead and trusting him with that. So the month passes with guy 1 working full time and guy 2 forgets all about their agreement. As soon as guy 2 sees extra money (thinking it must be a happy little accident) he instantly withdraws like half of of guy 1's salary and spends it within hours. Guy 2 is later defending his actions claiming  he had forgotten and therefore refused to pay back.

This happened almost 2 years  ago, guy 2 still hasn't paid anything back.

You just say "xxx reserved" in your LFM post. People don't do it because like you said, no one will go. Which should be pretty telling as to how the loot should be divided when it does drop.
---
When rare, valuable drops happen everyone wants a chance at it. Seems logical. If someone doesn't want me to roll they can pay me (market price / 5) and I'll pass.
---
I wouldn't expect anyone to pass my Rogue Edgemasters. They're BiS but they're like 300-500g.

&gt; Doesn't mean you're entitled to my time and bag space though

36 rogue here, reagents are not that expensive. Pickpocket a few mobs here and there and that should off set reagent cost imo. 12g is insanely low for a level 37!
---
I'm new to wow but I came across this last night on bfd and didn't realize how much it bothered me. We even killed the last boss and I said thanks for group and good job as we starting running out and nothing. Followed and the way to entrance since everyone was still in party and said thanks again. Nothing.

I took a break once after decking out a DK at level 80 or whatever tf it was during the expansion. Came back after a few months to find the character naked and broke. Turns out my best friend had my login info and had emptied it out thinking I had quit for good. I was soooooooo mad running WSG in a bunch of random greens I found on the AH with the 100g he got me back

---
I did not.
---
Well tribal will let you do devilsaur gear which is great for feral but also Hide of the Wild for your cloak. Hide of the Wild is doing real well right now
---
Hypnotic blade? As a rogue? Explain yourself!
---
What are you talking about? There are groups doing all endgame dungeons, ZF, SM, and Mara consistently. Lower level dungeons typically recruit more heavily through the general chat in that zone, but they're also easy to find. Again, this is on Skullflame, specifically Horde side
---
What's the average cost of a 30 spell power enchant?
---
That has nothing to do with it at all. As party leader you can modify the item rarity that items are rolled for. By default it is uncommon (green). I could set it to Epic or Legendary and then nobody gets to roll for anything in lower level dungeons.
---
*nods* zug zug

awesome! druid makes a lot of sense. stealth partner with option for tanking and healing. thanks for the advice!

Congratulations, you win the worst thing in the thread. I've even helped horde players on pvp servers do the chicken escorts because I despite them so much

You can also run straight to the cave, stand in waterfall and die. You'll res at Razor Hill and run from there. If you can't die in the cave, you could also drop HS and anti unstuck for the same result.

You‚Äôre only locked if you kill a boss.

meh, my guild will smash it as we farmed it to hell on many private servers but in the couple pugs ive done the average guild will get hard stuck on Vael.

Do you have a molten core ID if you type /raidinfo?
---
I had a similar issue, entered an hour before raid start (invited my alt, lowbie, converted to raid then entered on main) and got an ID under the raid info tab. I freaked out, walked out, logged out looking for solutions. When I logged back in 30 mins later the ID was gone. I think you just get an ID for that instance, but that's it, doesn't necessarily means a save.

Edit: missed 1 word

Ill take that in consideration thanks I hadn't thought about this

The tanaris one is unforgivable. Why does it make you travel around over half the circumference of the zone?? The chicken is just going to fly anyways, why can't he fly from near the pirate cove or something slightly more reasonable
---
No, its removed upon death.
---
I mean servers also have 20 times as many people on them so they should be higher if we don't want it to be miserable. Also vanilla had Chinese gold farmers lol
---
Holy crap.  I just noticed this because you noticed this!
---
i was way on board with spell batching when it was first announced based off their examples, but in practice, i hate it.
---
bis chest is cloth
---
People called 1v1 killing ganking in vanilla. I specifically remember this. You would be a "ganker" of you were the engager and you won.
---
Thats what i thought just wanted to make sure i didnt screw myself lol
---
Heh, I actually had to convince my gl that sm/ruin was also a viable spec, in part because my group gets the extra 48 stam imp buff.
---
I doubt anyone but a few Blizz employees know for sure how the ties are broken. Maybe it's an invisible roll, more likely it's just a random selection from a list.
---
did you level it at all or just run it straight to BB? I guess either would work, but must be a bit sad when you have to make the same graveyard run they do every time if you're getting 1shot as a level 1 haha
---
He had to be given a leash because of his AoE heal mechanic. If he ends up in a city, he becomes literally unkillable and will just create an infinite loop of spawning guards/killing guards/healing/spawning guards until the heat death of the universe (or a GM despawns him).
---
Or if you zoned into the same raid as someone who killed a boss.
---
To pillage the chest
---
It's not though, some of the BoEs have way more value when twinked than for leveling. 
---
Often for esoteric purposes that are gonna be lost on someone who never twinks, but to the guy who gets it off the auction house and builds his perfect class they're worth a lot compared to the guy who is gonna outlevel and vend them after he got it outta luck.
---
Yeah, well... that chase is like 90% of WoW.
---
Silly DPS warriors lol. Most do not want to and most when they are forced to suck at tanking. Befriend good deep/fury prot tanks. It makes you life waaaay easier.
---
Yeah, I was really doubting whether I could actually kill him because I remember it the way you describe... But then, surprisingly, it was pretty much just like attacking another level 49 character.
---
The thing is, blizzard can easily confirm if they did a retail gold transaction by checking their retail account. It isn't hard for them to verify that the same account that was given gold in classic gave gold in retail. They have mad logs. 
---
I don't know what's to stop people from buying wow tokens, selling those for retail gold, and then doing this. That would basically be a way to buy gold in classic without technically breaking the rules according to these GMs.
---
Don't have W10. Are you elitist? Rofl.
---
No changes
---
You‚Äôre a warrior. If it‚Äôs a dungeon. You‚Äôre a tank.
---
No but it's a pretty common opinion
---
Correct, I believe John Staats mentioned this
---
I don't have the maths on it, but I do know that having a lvl 60 run guildies through SFK/WC was how our twinks all got the items we wanted without over-leveling. 
---
This is to say that if you're running guildies through an instance, their gain would not be XP, but would be gear and quest completion, which both allow them to level up with greater ease. 
---
You're also giving them a guaranteed run, which (server dependent) is usually much faster than waiting to find a low-level tank or etc.
---
So there are lots of good reasons to run them through. But XP from mobs inside the instance would not be one of them.
---
In my experience undead rogues are pretty chill, like...we just like being spooky, the actual asshole things are fairly rare to keep up the reputation.
---
I haven't had any issues especially since they fixed the combat drop sequencing. You need to stop moving during the FD trap sequence and allow time for spell batching. Just requires a bit of skill. It's especially easy to FD trap out of a stun since you aren't moving. Hell in dungeons I have no problem using FD to get two traps into one pull
---
PvP Trinkets are going to change a lot of how the game is played. That being said, Rogues are at their strongest when nobody else has PvP trinkets.
---
I am a herbalist myself and honestly I am not sure how much it really pays of compared to any other activity you can do at 60 to earn money. For instance, a stack of an expensive plant like Mountain Silversage is around 15g on my server. I am sure you can't get a full stack in an hour, and even if you can, I feel like running dungeons is much more meaningful as you can actually earn money and look for your pre-bis and bis at the same time. And even if just farming, hitting Strat live is better than herbing as a Righteous Orb is selling 25+g each on AH and several can drop in a run.
---
Now, what you can do is go herb/alchemy and make some stuff that can be sold okayish, for instance Elixir of the Mongoose which goes at 15g a stack atm and always sells on my server. But still even when I do this I kinda question the whole process in terms of efficiency. I herb in hope to find Black Lotus (which I never did) and get this other stuff so it's not wasted time in the end at least.

/cast sacrifice (rank 2)
---
I once had a warrior tank who couldn't hold aggro for shit. Every DPS was giving him *more* than enough ample time to get at least some AoE threat, yet as soon as we attacked we instantly pulled aggro. The run took forever because I was always tanking at least one enemy whilst in cat form meaning I couldn't shred, with most of the others running around all over the place, even on the healer. I would even mark kill priority and focus his own target, though simple auto-attacks were often enough to claw back threat. Even when he was tanking just a *single* target, I would consistently end up tanking it even after giving him *over ten seconds* leeway. This is including using cower on cooldown too. I can't remember which dungeon it was specifically, but it was an endgame dungeon and I recall it taking over twice as long as standard to complete.
---
Everyone just continued on. We were all aware of his bad his tanking was, although no one explicitely pointed it out to him. At most people would just acknowledge it in a roundabout way, such as with stating "I'll taunt it off the healer if she draws aggro", "I'll wait ten seconds before I begin DPSing", or "I won't AoE at all", etc. It wasn't until most of the run through that I decided to just, straight forward, ask the question everyone was wanting to ask of "Why are we having these problems with threat?", to which the discussion eventually ended up with the tank stating that he respecced to protection right before the dungeon and had never tanked up until that point. I decided to take over the tanking at that point because I was sick of it all, and just wanted the run over with.
---
As someone who had tanked the dungeon themselves multiple times, and who has tanked probably 70% of their dungeons in general, there really is no excuse. It's okay to be bad, but this individual was *beyond* bad. People need to acknowledge that there is a basal level of requirement people expect in a group. There are four other members of the group to consider. He was lucky he was in one of the most patient groups I can envision.

ashenvale, nice place

Poisons are based on a Ppm system so a fast off hand doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean more poison procs.

Darna is the reason I rolled horde, strongest capitals placement + HS in kargath

Locks are by far the number 1 class in PvP and it‚Äôs not that close. Open world is a bit different but good locks just don‚Äôt lose to a single class 1v1
---
Since they elected A basic campfire as their new warchief
---
Yes. I recorded this on mobile. So?
---
You could also be like: O nice, some kind of World PVP! Good luck with getting your trinket mate.
---
If you ain't got nothing nice to say, then don't day a thing.
---
Lmao.
---
It's all a matter of priority. Some grey 2.9 speed weapon isn't gonna be better than epic of course.
---
In your caes I'd use the viper and tailspike imo.
---
The combat indicator comes up right in the middle of your health bar.
---
Well, around ~5% is basically baseline, and the build gets another 5% from talents.
---
So I was thinking another 4-5% from gear/int would not be unreasonable, especially given that the 200 shadow damage is low enough to leave plenty of room for other itemization.
---
&gt;I fucked up and I'd like to blame spell batching
---
Same man, it's worth it but imo leveling is not fun at all. The game is a blast at level cap though!
---
Have you run meters in dungeons though? Have you ended a dungeon and looked at the meters and seen anyone anywhere close to 500-600 DPS? 
---
Let's break down how a fight against a dungeon enemy might go, if you're using Corr, CoA and SB. 
---
If you start instantly as the tank puts you in combat, T=0 cast corruption, T=1.5 cast CoA, T=3 start SB1, T=5.5 start SB2, T= 8 start SB3, T= 8.5 mob dies. 
---
So you got 2 corruption ticks for like 350 dmg, some low end CoA ticks for like 200 dmg, and two shadowbolts for let's say avg of 850. 2250 dmg in 8.5 seconds = 265 DPS. 
---
Obviously in a multidotting scenario it will go up a bit, and you can use shadowburn, but you also have to deal with the tank not giving a damn about DPS mana and being forced into lifetaps/drainlifes. The point is practical DPS isn't just slightly lower than paper DPS, it's a LOT lower.
---
Can someone explain spell batching?
---
Is there any addon through twitch that shows incoming heals such as heal comm?  I‚Äôm a moron and can‚Äôt download addons outside of twitch lol
---
Thousand needles, has such a unique levelling experience. The enemies are super tough and some quests are down right impossible alone. But that teaches you to play smart and gets you ready for end game. Also the Shimmering flats is a great refreshing part of the zone and begins the carrot on a stick quest chain.

Download Atlas Loot addon and look at dungeon drops. You should be able to go at few dungeons now and get some items. But don't beat yourself up about it as you level and replace items relatively fast when low level.

Desolace, it's a zone by look and definition should be boring and full. However I find it to be the exact opposite. Tons of lore and history if your looking for it. Between the ancient night elf ruins, and the demonic forces controlling them now. To the centaur and how their society works. All the way to Kodos and them traveling from the barrens to desolace when they get close to death. Beautiful zone.
---
Leveled to 10 then ran south to Ratchet.  Actually didn‚Äôt die on the trip there even thru Ashenvale.  Now I move around between npc‚Äôs in Booty Bay.  I chose a priest to heal myself after taking dmg.
---
You can still loot it from the corpse right? Just need to destroy something then pick it up from the body. I'm almost positive it's even still locked to you so no one else can loot it
---
When you get an ultimatum you know it's over.
---
Second this. Best hearthstone location. Easy ZF farming, DM running or sithilus ele farming
---
Your quality is disabled clearly
---
Go to the social menu (o by default)
---
Go to raids, and there's a tab called raid info I think? It shows you if you're locked into a raid and what the ID is.
---
I had a second layer like 4 hours ago, I doubt it changed since then.
---
Yep, just look at all the ancient celebs out there with their 20 something arm candy models. Because, ya know... they have sooo much in common (like compatible genitalia).
---
No. Warriors in dungeons tank. Regardless of spec. Period the end. 
---
Calling the gatekeeping is ridiculous. If he doesn‚Äôt want to ever be asked to tank then he should reroll because he‚Äôs gonna have serious trouble getting into groups.
---
Winterspring. Always loved winter related places and it does not disappoint.
---
if he does it aint even a big deal. cause we know something small like this means nothing in the long run. you act like i got with his gf and was lying about it. i just wanted to stay home for one night without having to explain myself. its easier to just say i wanna stay home to study than it is to say i wanna stay home and not hangout with you.  if something like that hurts your friendship maybe you needa toughen up or build stronger friendships.
---
I hear you and it‚Äôs valid but difference being if it was someone else‚Äôs BiS I‚Äôd have just let em have it and not even thought about the value. As I‚Äôve done many times before.  I‚Äôm in the run just to play and have fun actually and if something great comes my way then so be it.
---
Tbh if you were an adult and they were in high school you acted pretty immaturely.
---
But.. But.. I am a God üò¢
---
&gt; 10 feet from finishing the Tooga escort quest by himself
---
You're a monster! You hear me? A MONSTER
---
At least you do feel bad about it though. Escort quests solo are BS enough in classic without being ganked imo haha
---
Only sometimes
---
True in theory, but there have been several complaints recently about being locked after just zoning into a new instance, so there appears to be a bug that locks you after zoning in even to a clean instance.
---
Ran a friend through deadminesaat night and he got half a level still not counting quests and did it in maybe a quarter of the time getting a real group for it and going through would take.
---
In 2004 Vanilla WoW, 1 server = 1 world.
---
To accommodate for the influx of short-term Classic players in 2019, they made it 1 server = *n* worlds, each copy of the world being a ‚Äúlayer.‚Äù This allows more people to login and play without jamming each other up. The intent, ultimately, is to reduce the number *n* down to 1 as the short-term players slowly stop playing.
---
As of today, virtually every server is back to having a single copy of the world.
---
That‚Äôs rough man
---
You‚Äôre in luck, a week or two ago they released a huge expansion to deadmines
---
You absolute legend
---
There's plenty money to be made from DE boe's. You can also pair it with another profession and DE the items you make. 
---
A lot of times I win greed rolls for soulbound blues that vendor for 1-2g but I can DE it into a small radiant shard which sells for more. Sometimes I find weird stat boe's that no one wants to buy, but doesn't vendor for much. Those often make me more money by DE.
---
It‚Äôs not ridiculous. It‚Äôs literally the same level of difficulty to get into a group as a rogue.
---
Where is this? Ive never heard of a cave system
---
Which hunters are dogshit at for 99% of thr playerbase.  All my years playing ive never seen a skilled hunter in pvp, and even when skilled they still get fucked
---
maybe having a kid before youre 25 is always a questionable idea
---
I timed in the other day.  It's a 14 minute flight from Darn to Tanaris.
---
I much prefer a clean, silent run, as opposed to a messy, social run.
---
Damn I love Winterspring.
---
Also, you can gain a lot of your lower levels by DEing.
---
ok thank you
---
Not wrong.
---
What a fantastic zone, right?
---
Distractionare
---
Regardless of whether or not I was dead anyway, the mobs didn't get slowed by CoC that's all I'm trying to show
---
What I really don't get it why warriors don't take it upon themselves to tank dungeons. It just makes finding dungeons easier. 
---
I can advertise myself as a DPS and wait a half hour for the group to form and then compete with the other warrior for loot. OR, I can advertise myself as a tank and have groups lining up to kiss my ass to tank their dungeons, and I can dictate that there be no other warriors in the group to compete against me for loot.
---
It's a very valuable skillset, and the hardest part of it is just paying attention.
---
truesilver still sells for a good amount on my server, so still a win.
---
Ya alli pugs wipe on trash before Luci
---
Mage in LBRS. The tank mentions he hasnt run the dungeon before and we have a couple sloppy pulls but we are getting through it. We get to a certain point and we call out a pat but the tank doesnt see it and pull. Well we lived and had an amazing recover. I take a look at the damage meters and no mage 0 dmg. I look and hes in IF.. hearth or portaled as soon as the pull happened.. well fuck that guy
---
A couple weeks go by and I'm in a Strat Live group. Its been a while so I didnt recognize the name but he was in our group. After saying we are going to summon and to meet at the side entrance he ignores it and goes to through main gate. Now hes stuck and we have to wait for the other two to travel, fyi main entrance to Stratholme cant be exited once you go through the portal. So we go through main gate with him. Then right as the group is about to start he hearths away. So now we are all stuck in main gate and cant summon one more. It was such a shitshow and I will never forget his name
---
If you're stuck on levelling go do dungeons with a few guildies or friends.
---
To me if someone needs an items to use immediately it should take priority over giving it to someone to sell it for an hypothetical amount of currency that will maybe buy a future upgrade. Its the diference between giving someone a solid upgrade and respecting the fact that it will benefit someone greatly, over just giving a chance for another person to get an uncertain amount of value out of it, both economical and in terms of an upgrade. Thats how I see it and if it would roll against me getting a BoE for me to sell it, I would be OK like I did many times in the past and other people did it for me
---
No it‚Äôs not at all because you‚Äôll have a real warrior, generally the group leader, who doesn‚Äôt want to roll against someone who doesn‚Äôt understand that they are also a tank. A warrior inviting another warrior is significantly more rare than a warrior inviting a rogue.
---
Not, WAS, but WILL BE!
---
If people are contributing their dues to the group, then why does it matter if they stay silent? Not everyone is here to make friends. Some people just want to put on some music and relax. It *is* a game after all.
---
Back in vanilla, I would stalk outside refuge point in arathi with my BM hunter. I‚Äôd just sit on the hill and wait for unsuspecting lowbies to come to town to turn quests in. I‚Äôd send my WS prowler kitty in enraged and kill groups of players.
---
Ah, I see you're a man of culture as well.
---
And you were alive because a Warlock soulstoned you or a Paladin DI'd you.
---
But that's not the point, nor is the extra health. The extra mana is the point. It doesn't cost you any extra mana to use max rank of Resurrection compared to using rank 1, but it gives the resurrected player 7 times as much mana.
---
That extra mana means they can start resurrecting sooner, they can start rebuffing sooner, etc. But because you're too cheap to spend 8g60s (excluding discounts) to learn the max rank, you're instead wasting the time of (up to) 39 others.
---
4Head
---
spell effects batched together. if two mages sheep each other at rougly the same time they both get sheeped. they improved it dramatically in newer versions of wow so if even one sheep went off slightly before the other, only one mage got sheeped.
---
they purposely went with a bigger(smaller?) spell batching window in classic to preserve the vanillalike feel, but in my opinion its getting old pummeling an enemy in a dungeon and still getting hit by the spell
---
Then you will realize you are a paladin and bubble hearth when you start to lose.
---
Well now you see that your mentality is at odds with that of the general community. So you can carry on giving free gold to others for the sake of "fun", while others dont reciprocate or you can just accept all need on boe
---
*-"Cat's in the Cradle" intensifies-*
---
As someone who never raided myself, how hard it is to tank a raid compared to a dungeon as feral druid?
---
It's great for shammies with Windfury or paladins with SoC, allowing them to have a little bit more burst (StormStrike into Lightning) or spiff up their healing rotation in 5/10 mans.
---
Mograine is one of the largest servers on EU. Removing the layering might take some effort, that's why lower pop servers went first
---
There are physical problems that will arise from sitting in front of a computer all day. It isn't good for your health. Yes you can get up and excercise but a lot of people don't when they get into a game addiction and often start to eat poorly too
---
Lol pally tanks.
---
Go to tanaris, som south by the coast, then West..  theres a small farmlike building out front
---
The profit margins for disenchanting items and selling them aren't usually great. I make a bit of money by disenchanting greed rolled BoP's, but most of my money comes from tips. There is a big up front investment for enchanting in buying all the desirable recipes, but once you have them, you'll be in pretty high demand. On Arugal-Horde, people often tip me 5-10 gold for say a crusader enchantment.
---
How often does that happen? I doubt you have more than around 20-25% crit chance while leveling so like 1/5- 1/4 mobs. Just not worth all the extra time spent in stealth.
---
I really like it. Well sometimes, depends on the mobs. But when I don't like it, I just skip this grind, and that's it
---
We‚Äôre good, man, I swear!
---
Well that makes more sense
---
Hillsbrad isn't bad but there are murlocs all along the coast.
---
Apparently it‚Äôs satire with some truth to it? Idk I‚Äôm was confused as well
---
idk if its spell batching or not, but something on the games end fucked up. cone of cold has a slow. it hit, did damage, but did not apply the slow.
---
not everyones complaint about the game is unfounded
---
I might record a bit someday once I get a new external hard drive
---
Probably his first BG or him attempting to tank.
---
Same thing happened to me with Starcraft 2. Not fun.
---
But being first in line for Thunderfury in Classic when I can play full time makes it alright !
---
For pvp onyxia book is best imo, the skeleton keeps rogues out of stealth, can daze and does respectable damage
---
After a little more research I found it‚Äôs proc can let you auto-cap flags in BGs as well.. I‚Äôm thinking this might be the big one lol
---
Lakeshire EU has about 17% alliance lol, could always be worse
---
This will minimize the casualties to come here.
---
There is a forge but no anvil. I think it's a blacksmith trainer but no mining trainer. No ore spawns there. It's the worst.
---
Orgimmar
---
Check out sixtyupgrades
---
Can I buy your account
---
Flying kinda destroyed what wow is, it removed a huge amount of player interaction. Didnt have to fight for nodes of ore and such. I mean the walk sucks but adds to the feeling of accomplishment by making the other times more valuable
---
Yea well after playing through low level zones for like 20 different characters only to have most of the servers die or get erased sucks. Would i buy a ticket to lvl 30+? No. Ill do the grind one more time. When im high enough to gank in STV, i wont care about levelling anymore.
---
Yeah at this time we have other max enchanters in my guild who have most of the BIS enchants, so I dont think they would come to me. Thanks!
---
With the discounts for being honoured by your faction, how much do mounts &amp; the riding skill cost?
---
My wow playtime is me basically doing whatever I want, if I want to kill a bunch of mobs, I do so... if i feel like giving a bunch of my crafted items to random strangers I do so... I am still within the level 20 range (although I haven't played as much as a bunch of players so that could be it)
---
This is some seriously cringe gatekeeping. Warriors are the highest dps in the game at present. There is literally zero justification for saying "if you play a Warrior, sorry, sometimes you have to tank". Stop trying to tell other people how they have to play. 
---
You're right though, what this warrior in particular should have done was delete his character and reroll mage/hunter/warlock/rogue. Because that's a far more reasonable response than just finding a group of people who aren't impatient idiots.
---
I think you should join the ElvUI discord

&gt;*clearly just being a selfish, greedy pig interested in nothing but stuffing your pockets with all the gold in the world and screwing over every person you come across to get it*
---
Glad you can finally admit it. Now doesn't that feel better? ;)
---
I realize that....you're just not getting what I'm saying or something. The whole point of what I'm saying that you can balance a healthy lifestyle and play wow or any other activity... It's about self control and my main point is to practice self control,not just run away from anything that's "too enjoyable" because you can't get up or wash yourself or eat right while doing it. I just think it's ridiculous that people suggest quitting wow if you struggle to balance it with life....like no...just realize what you're doing and make adjustments, because if that's how you are with wow then there is bound to be something else in life that puts you in the same position and you'd be better off just controlling yourself... It's like "diets" yeah you can just rid your entire house and keep everything "bad" for you out of sight for an eternity, but you could also learn self control and not stuff 24 Oreos in your mouth... Actually put in mental effort and only eat a couple on ocassion and it's going to be better for you in the long run then hiding from them. The problem will just come back one way or another eventually if you just run from it.
---
Unless you got lucky and digged up a very rare antique dagger in your backyard and sold it to the highest bidder
---
Depends on your server of course, but on mine it's around 200g mats.
---
I am currently farming mara, and plan to start doing lasher farms when im a bit more geared. Dropping enchanting for herb is sounding more pleasing. I do have a skinning alt which I could put enchanting on to send over my greens?
---
Thanks for the help!
---
You always got locked it A, the group leader has downed a boss, or B the first person to zone in had downed a boss. 
---
Also note. You had 1 minute, and received  warnings as such, to leave the raid instance before you were locked. I havent joined a group that would get me locked in classic yet, so I dont know how ot works now.
---
Ashenvale! So many hidden little areas, the moonwells with sprite darters flying around, the danger lurking around every corner.  Being followed and sapped by an unseen rogue until I want to cry and log off. Good times!
---
The orbs are used for both +healing and Crusader  weapon enchants. This means there's pretty steady demand for them as people are always looking to upgrade, and then re-enchant, weapons. On Faerlina, Righteous Orbs are selling for about 25-30g a piece atm.
---
Dude didn‚Äôt know about /stuck I take it? Heh.
---
The commentator is streamer OG_Jeffery on twitch. Very entertaining, he always does wPvP in BRM and Hillsbrad as a lvl 30 Twink
---
Oh those gold farmers!   Ni Hao, 10 dorrah 1hunred go!
---
TFW your item sells the instant you post it...
---
Go look again now. Because they have dropped massively on every server that has this spawn time change. Good luck selling any of them.
---
DE your BoP blues as you level. It‚Äôs worth it I paired that with skinning and it‚Äôs a great source of income. Doing that and then switching out of skinning to gathering (mining or herb) is a great option once you get your mount and are able to traverse zones more quickly.
---
There is someone on Gandling horde side that can whisp a certain Grolol please? He's reskilling me, now it's 2 hours that i can't play, he's 60 or so and i'm lvl 30, i'd like that, thank you.
---
Kirtonos?
---
I wish they made it a level 100 zone at least. I'd love to redo the story and quests there, but cant really be arsed without an incentive
---
That's og_jeffery on twitch
---
James Cameron showed it can be done...
---
I have a really busy schedule so I can‚Äôt promise, but if I get around to it I‚Äôd love to sketch something up for you. Go ahead and send me a screenshot or something!
---
That's because you are heals. You never group with shamans who actually embraced what their class was designed to be in dungeons and raids: healers. 
---
I swear a good 80% of enhancers do not know that their rotation looks as follows: 
---
windfury, strength of earth, mana totem, autohit to have enough mana for the next pull
---
They dont even drink when the mage does. Enhancers are weird, man.
---
Same as TB
---
How would that work? Name plates are still a thing and treant doesn't really look like a tree...
---
I hit 7 in a row, stopped completely because I couldn't believe it. Jumped with no flip. Shouldn't have stopped jumping :(
---
Feralas is a great place with a wild &amp; awesome vibe.
---
BRD - I like being the one who knows the way through the dungeon so that I have some usefulness lol
---
It's insane. I'm married, work full time and am writing a thesis in a foreign language. There is a huge amount of stuff in my life that requires both immediate attention and long-term planning. It can be incredibly stressful trying to manage these things. Yet I'm thinking about possible leveling respecs, questions in new zones, reminiscing over past memories, etc.
---
I first hit 60 when I was 15ish, IIRC. Having to get into a Ventrilo server with my guild to do dungeons and MC/BWL produced massive social anxiety, since most of my guildies were older than me. I remember intentionally lowering my voice to sound older than I was. Ultimately, playing WoW with them led to me developing social skills and acquiring some acculturation. That seriously amplified in TBC, when I started doing arenas and needed to communicate even more, on a more personal setting. 
---
Tl;dr: WoW helped me develop social skills I still rely upon to this day.
---
Edit: I'd like to apologize in advance for choosing a gnome mage for the reroll. At 60, I played an UD mage. After classic's release, my best friend I played with during Vanilla and onward had rolled alliance at the behest of his girlfriend, who also played Vanila but as alliance. Unfortunately, I had to take one for the team and roll the gnome to continue to hang with my homies. Foiled again by the significant other.
---
It is all about gear and raw stats for pvp. If you hot load stamina and have top tier weapons and enchants you can start fucking up poorly geared people even up to level 60. They'll have some advantage from just having higher stats due to level, but inspect the randos around you next time you're in town or on a boat. You'll be shocked at the shit people have equipped. I saw a level 59 warrior the other day wearing level 24 items. I saw a level 48 hunter with white level 20ish bracers with no stats.
---
People will literally play with gear that they could upgrade by spending 2 gold in the AH (and upgrade every single piece they are wearing).
---
I think this is why you see so many stories about people struggling in the higher levels. They completely neglect gear. Then they hit 60 and get fucked up by a well geared level 49 and want to complain that their level should give them even more inherent advantage, which it shouldn't in pvp.  
---
A lot of kids on this game complain when you point out that pvp is about gear first, and skill second, but it really is. Not to say that skill isn't important, but it makes a huge difference to be geared out.
---
they're still 13 lol I sold 90 skins yesterday
---
you sound salty
---
Like I said, that's how it's supposed to work but there appears to be a bug where it locks you to the first instance you enter, _even if no bosses have been downed_. 
---
I don't recall a warning before being locked back in vanilla, though it was a long time ago, but I definitely didn't get a warning last weekend when I got locked to my guild's existing raid.
---
Wrong
---
Nice to see thunder fury balanced a little from a month ago.
---
The ratio was 62 to 38 at one point.
---
Nvm maybe it still is.
---
Zul'Farrak - The music and salty serene sands of Tanaris is surprisingly calm. I think this has to do more with nostalgia on my OG rogue character grinding for the lycan helm more than anything!
---
THIS GUY HAS THE RIGHT ANSWER.
---
Pro tip: be mage, easy access anywhere.
---
Still have to grind out the exp
---
Try skipping that group and not going AOE'ng mobs with casters.
---
Tbf the Druid thing is mostly bc assuming roughly equal levels no one wants to take 30 mins out of their day to fight another Druid.
---
 This is my Specc: [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IE0bhRbk...](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?v=DulwYGJFADY&amp;event=video_description&amp;redir_token=mwdvf3_7JChHygLXSwggTAELkDN8MTU3MTk2MDExN0AxNTcxODczNzE3&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fclassicdb.ch%2F%3Ftalent%23IE0bhRbkAZZgx0tM0z)

With this specc you can farm solo in DM East and Maraudon, play pvp and pve all the time.
---
I was literally thinking about Thex the other day, wondering if you had hit 60. Good to hear you are almost there I'm 56 too!
---
18g/72g.
---
Total of 90g for both.
---
Wait, really?
---
Dalaran is my favourite cuz its one of the few places that makes people on discord or chat passing it do a double take and wonder what‚Äôs inside  how It‚Äôs even there
---
I hate when healers put the bubble up immediately after we engage a enemy. And then he wonders why he‚Äôs pulling Aggro and low on mama
---
lol, damn, I was just thinking the other day about playing this exact prank on my guild leader. That makes me want to do it even more now. :-)
---
That should only work immediatly when they are in a rested area and not in combat right?
---
There have been a couple of macros that take you to password screen, that is afaik not intended and I don't know if there is one that works atm. I'd recommend something like "/run while true do end", a simple infinite loop that will crash your game.
---
Wait, so you kept trying to res for two hours instead of just taking a spirit res?
---
idk, gold isn't really as difficult to make in osrs as it is wow imo
---
I remember back when I played. Silvermoon was the haven for the RPers on my server.
---
it's the only place to learn bows.
---
Leatrix Plus add-on tells you their name, their guild, rank in the guild, class, level, and target just by mouseing over them, don't even have to target yourself.
---
9k upvotes and still around, huh. Did the mods stop pushing their crappy 'low effort meme' agenda? Because this is awesome but clearly fits the silly definition they used.
---
Whelps (SoS, Badlands, Dustwallow) for Small Flame Sacs. I was making 15-20/hour at 36-44, I‚Äôm sure you could finish a circuit much quicker at 60 and mix something else in for a little more.
---
Honestly, I'm German and I never even figured she was supposed to be German when og playing the game until seeing memes about it years later on the web. I always thought she was supposed to be Russian and couldn't even properly make out what she was saying despite really liking the voice acting. Her voice reminded me more of how German movies portray a stereotypical Russian accent.
---
I quit because I was bored and I thought I should have a life. I went and had a life for 10 years.  
---
Wow is better. Women come and go, I'm prioritizing my own life and just doing whatever I want now. And I'm way happier than I've ever been.
---
Just trying to set parameters for the conversation to continue. But agreed we‚Äôre done here.
---
This is usually why people spec 2/3 imp blizzard. 
---
Sounds like OP has 3/3
---
Warrior who did about 70DPS and constantly switched between Destiny (the epic 2h), dual wield and 1h/shield. Couldn't keep aggro for shit. Probably tried to level 3 weapon skills at once. Then he won the baron cloak (which I didn't need but some people who actually contributed did).
---
Not taking that guy again
---
Interesting.
---
Suggestion, would it be possible to have this addon act as a plugin and hook into a Details! window frame?
---
Yeah thats what Phase 1 is about currently, theres so little to do I just get all 'chores' out of the way so I dont have to do them when PvP and BG's come out
---
Fair enough.
---
Arcane crystals are great paydays but you can search for a long time without any. DM easy jump runs are the best reliable source but even then it takes a lot of runs to get that cash. 
---
As a tank the best answer is dungeon spam. Once you are geared, get a good 5man prot spec and just run dungeons all day. People always need tanks. You can set the pace as fast as you can. The gold stacks right up.
---
legit did not notice the typo lmao meant to say hard.
---
Nice of him telling you he would've ninja'd the axe by MLing it. That's what he tried by gaining lead - as you probably know naturally! :)
---
Soulshards tend to give off an... odor...

TIL about something called "banks."  
---
&lt;nervously eyes closet full of cash jars&gt;
---
I remember Auctioneer back in the day had a Sniper function that one could leave continuously scanning for drastically underpriced items.   Fun times.
---
Because the fewer repetitive posts daily about a known issue, being posted to Reddit rather than the correct channel which would be the official forums or in game ticket system, the less shitposts to wade through and the less work for the mods.
---
Sounds like you‚Äôre in the wrong guild, my guild has an enhance and ele shaman and we clear rag every week. Play to have fun, not to please others.
---
Not to sound insensitive but if he has been killing you nonstop for two hours then do you really think he would stop if someone whispered him? He would probably be happy that he annoyed someone enough that they got someone on the other faction to message them.
---
ah ok, so now the comment someone else made about only getting 2/3 improved blizzard makes a bit more sense.
---
It was changed today so I don't rly care what you sold yday, but good on you if you can sell, because you won't be able to for long.
---
Beautifully written.
---
The only "fact" that is certain here is that my evidence outweighs anything that you have presented. You can try to divert the conversation, but until you present more convincing evidence than what I have it doesnt matter what else you say.
---
Hmm I‚Äôd be interested in seeing what gear he has equipped
---
Y'all can come over to Anethema! We don't have any queue times.
---
STV/Tanaris. Both are important milestones in my leveling journeys.
---
Oh Christ this is so fucking funny
---
The axe is vastly superior.
---
It changed from 13g to nothing in the past 30 mins I checked it? Sorry but just because your realm is diving doesn't mean mine has yet.
---
Its insane if you're a tank/healer lol.  Every time I heal a pug and someone is doing above avg gameplay In general or fully utilizing their class abilities I'll usually ask to friend them for future groups.  Always let people know to add me and let me know if they need a healer for anything in the future, it goes quite a ways.
---
Your loot council is fucked in the head

What is good levelling gear to aim for as a warlock? Stuff like the level 30 robe, or the gravestone scepter. Currently level 43

You‚Äôre an actual genius for reserving reed instead of losing the roll 14 times out of 40+ Jed kills like me.   
---
But I‚Äôm a resto sham. I couldn‚Äôt farm up that reserve cash if my life depended on it.
---
I guess I could have done that, but I think I was already in blasted lands when I joined group.
---
It was changed 2 days ago btw I only posted about it now cause I've made a ton of money and want others to know about it and ruin the free farm currently going on

This is just reddit being dumb and wrong again.  No one that matters actually gives a shit if you charge for tank services, though I would at least wait until you've gotten everything you need from that dungeon.
---
Are those worth it? I don't think I've ever completed one they're so long and annoying.
---
I was about to post something but fuck OP you guys are messed up lmao
---
Imagine making the choice to play a mage and then complaining about people asking you to conjure water.
---
No, I mean the small map in the top right.
---
Except mages can blink stuns and have two ice blocks. So mages are already okay. Not to mention mages trinkets don‚Äôt break stuns...
---
your critchance can be seen under the Attack ability in spellbook, try that?
---
And perhaps you are right. I should have specified. No one can tell you how to play your class, just don't expect to be taken seriously or thought of highly if you can't perform your hybrid class's roles. That is why I suggested pure DPS classes. He can do exactly what he wants to do without any scrutiny of not being able to fully utilize his class. 
---
And of course warrior is highest DPS late game. But if a leveling warrior is incapable of tanking a dungeon, I highly question their ability to even come close to that late game potential. 
---
&gt;impatient idiots.
---
Oddly enough, it's actually expected that if you play warrior, you have at least an elementary prowess over your class. But, I do agree with you in calling the rest of the team impatient idiots. As soon as I see a warrior say "DPS only" or "I can't tank" anywhere from 13-49, I treat them like they have the plague. More than likely a bad player, as evidenced in this post.
---
Ooof. He went into the stable then:P Thank you.
---
Okay lets be real here, you're probably the only arguing about this having to be prioritized. If they prioritized a small issue like that Layering and p2 would be put on hold just for you to get a tiny fix
---
Hahahaha
---
No it barely does any damage. Does a ton of threat though. And you can force it to proc using shield block.
---
i dont understand. this is just fanmade?
---
Wailing Caverns.
---
The area outside of it is gorgeous and running through all those elites to get into the dungeon just to see it in all of its full glory? It really solidified my love of classic. It was such a wave of nostalgia.
---
I haven't made it to Scholomance yet or I'm sure it would be up there too.
---
Great stuff man
---
His Neil Degrasse Tyson interviews will blow your mind.
---
Earlier today while i was killing centaurs in the barrens i had this terrible epiphany.
---
"Im 34 years playing the same game i spent ridiculous amount of hours on 15 years ago,single, no job and renting a basement .."
---
Now wow wasn't to blame for all of it, i'm in debt from having 3 surgeries last year but the opportunities and time i could have committed somewhere else.. who knows?
---
Had a good interview yesterday and have been hitting the gym as soon as i was able to, but damn..  score cards are reading zero, and 5,10..15 years ago i thought id have things figured out by now. 
---
They same time enjoyed is not time wasted but i have some measure of regret.
---
I wish you contentment in whatever you do.
---
WF is more dps FT is garboshit, he's just lost in the sauce put out by "classic experts".  1h+shield is actually incredibly efficient while leveling because of the lower incoming damage and still decently good dps.  The problem is that once you get into a dungeon the 2h becomes much better, especially if he's got ravager in ZF.  
---
That said, and even if he didn't have anything better, he's still got totems and can make himself useful.  If the healer was doing more damage he was just bad, 1h+shield is enough dps for enh in a party if played correctly.
---
Damn where do you live that the life expectancy is 15 years old?
---
Undercity / Lordaeron. Having loved WC3, it was amazing walking into the throne room while you hear whispers and shadows of cheers. The whole city-under-a-city thing is also just cool AF, like how you fly in/out through a sewer tunnel
---
tell me how i can politely tell a guildie warlock who pulls threat on ony to stop
---
very annoying watching him get people breathed on, i don't wanna complain to leaders because they already know + i'll get internally blacklisted lol
---
Keep playing, invite the good players to your friendlist, join a proper guild and in no time you are not playing with randoms anymore apart from being paid to tank. 
---
That's part of why there are so few tanks available to pugs. The decent ones build their social network so quickly, that you can't foster more healthy relationships than you already have in your friendlist.
---
I‚Äôm gonna start charging for each totem and chain heal.
---
Durotar because duel 1v1 me bro
---
Righteous Orbs are high level crafting materials used for endgame enchanting and crafted armor. It's pretty common for tanks to take the first one in "live" Stratholme as a form of payment, because there's very little gear they can't get in a few runs. Also tanks have high repair costs and low farming ability.
---
Yea but he‚Äôs acting like this is the only way to get a skeletal horse. You can farm runecloth, and if you were going for this you wouldn‚Äôt buy your race mount, so you don‚Äôt pay another 900g. If he was alliance (or Tauren) I would actually understand the pain, because thats the only way to get a skele.
---
Yeah but trolls are S T I C C while taurens are T H I C C
---
A brick?
---
Ah, yes. Opening AFK/Undergeared players and only showing the successful attempts. The real Vanilla end game
---
Thunderbluff, I really enjoyed my time hanging there.
---
Didn‚Äôt people not go full prot even in actual vanilla?
---
Yes but he waited the blizzard out mate watch the video
---
What did you do to him that made him camp you for two hours? Because honestly no one camps for that long. They get bored after 10-20 minutes. You prolly deserved it
---
Then thank you for clarifying that.
---
I'm not arguing that it shouldn't be prioritized. It should. I just wanted to know op's intent for the post, what he hoped to accomplish.
---
Prot pallies: what's better for tanking 5 mans: Deathbone or Lawbringer (tier 1)?
---
Lawbringer has nice intellect and stam but deathbone has the defence, I'm not sure what to value more
---
The best reasons to be run through a dungeon are 1) completing quests and 2) getting gear drops. Other than that, yeah, it might be decent XP but you'd do better to be grinding and doing quests at the same time than sitting around absorbing a tiny trickle of xp.
---
Pretty weird thing to gatekeep honestly.
---
Better state that rule that boes are reserved at the start of the group then.
---
Orgrimmar. I love the old design
---
For sure the starting crypt where Undead spawn. Where the journey began!
---
Tell him to SS and let him do it but have him go to tank spot when she lands,
---
Hatin on the admins. I had a funny post too that got deleted for the reason above
---
I mean look at all the comments defending bad tanks here. Good on him for admitting it, but there's a lot of people here straight up pretending he's not bad. I've grouped with tanks like him that didn't even admit they're bad and straight up charge in on mobs then pull everything and wipe everyone.
---
That is not a bad tanking problem, I think that guy is right. That's a bad player problem. Anyone that thinks charging into mobs around other mobs is a bad player.

Wait what happened to it?
---
I found a group as a DPS warrior the other night, jackpot I thought. As soon as I joined, another Warrior left the group. "Who was that?" "The tank..." After about a minute of looking for a tank unsuccessfully... "Fine, I'll tank I guess."
---
Yes, it is normal mainly for raid offtanks. Only main tanks really need to consider going full prot.

Disclaimer: PvP can happen in any form on PvP servers. It‚Äôs in the rules, I support it, I enjoy it. Without those rules that let people play like that I wouldn‚Äôt get to do the world PvP I enjoy.
---
That said... people who do things like that, just getting off on ruining another persons gaming experience and hoping they get mad ‚Äúbecause I can‚Äù will never be anything other than extremely sad and pathetic to me. If the only excuse you need to be a dick to other people is that nothing is stopping you... that says a lot about you as a person.

im decked out in full "of the gorilla" gear, i is smart as well as STRONG
