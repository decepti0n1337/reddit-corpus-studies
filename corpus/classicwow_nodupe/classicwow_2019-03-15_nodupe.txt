So what was the hiddne agenda? Jewish conspiracy to bomb 9/11? I knew it. The US said terrorists were using wow to communicate. 
---
This is why I want post Naxx content. This would be true Vanilla.
---
Absolutely awesome map! Definitely saving this one.. Though I would love a high res version without the zone level labels and dotted lines to put on my wall.
---
Keep me in mind if you end up finding a guild. I'm looking to raid pretty much any night after 10 PM PST

As a Horde shadow priest, I liked being able to stack Silent Resolve with Shadow Affinity. Vanilla was the best. Mind blast on cooldown, homies.
---
Let me know if you find a guild. I'm looking to raid after 10 PM PST
---
Blizzard made a business decision to open the game up to casuals and lose some of the hardcore nerds who loved things like lengthy grinds, massive organisational overhead for raiding, lots of specs being traps and so on.
---
Classic is them looping back to scoop up that market again because it's still juicy enough to be profitable.
---
You no more need to hide under a blanket in fear that they will turn Classic into Retail than you have to live in fear that Unilever will turn Dove into Axe. These are two different products which they are deliberately aiming at two different audiences.
---
Haha, hey man! I was probably somewhere around 13 years old at this point. I didn't care about the math - it was purple!
---
Red if you're heavily into PvP, put rubber O-rings under them.  I mine are and it's great.
---
Brown for raiders, blue for RPers.
---
[removed]
---
Well they can't do fuck all because his IP is not Blizzard. Blizzard owns the rights to world of warcraft and are the only one that have the legal right to take action.
---
I was living away from home with my best friend at that point, hints the reason the urge was soo high to skip and play WoW lmao
---
Remember he laughed at me for days over it too.
---
I’m going to play a female character and GL stopping me BOIII
---
Not even sure how i am going to find time to take care of my kid and go to work now. Fuck. 
---
I once got a very similar geared warrior to 2% hp using only rank 1 frostbolt and a wand, but then a spriest came and mind controlled me off a cliff.
---
I’ve also heard of using it on dog packs in MC
---
I was really young during classic. I still played a lot and over many months got a character to 60. Learned a lot from my older cousins and friends that played and managed to run onyxia a few times and molten core later on (probably around the time Naxx was out). But even when I was hardcore raiding in Wrath I still always loved to go back to these raids and relive those memories when I was younger. Now as an adult, getting a second chance to go back and play seriously in those raids that I enjoyed so much growing up is amazing. And im way more than excited. 
---
He doesnt get it OP. Dont worry. 
---
I think they will have to do the same thing. 1min queue for every 1% it is out from a 55/45% split, with a button directly below the queue for a free faction transfer.
---
2500 damage crushing blow with 12k HP and 30% dodge. Ill be fine.
---
Not sure if it counts because of private server,but I was doing LBRS on Darrowshire (Nost PvE) and Krol Blade drops and I sold it for 300g. The server announced it would shutdown three days later. 
---
Bow of searing arrows which lead to my 39 twink hunter 
---
Sepulcher. Which is around the time you'd be heading there.
---
*logs on to Priest* You are forgiven my son.
---
Did this only take 12 minutes though?
---
Maybe. I would still rather not take any chances. Blizzard hasn't given me a reason to have confidence in them in over 10 years so I prefer the safe approach.
---
Resilience just decreased crit and dot damage a little bit.
---
I liked it after the patches, i didnt play it the first year it was out, i heard it was bad then
---
Definitely the Sepulcher. It has the gates and the crypt along with the little hut to the right of it.
---
In Tier 4 I topped the damage meters once on my shadow priest in a 25-toon raid. Granted that was only the once, but I was always up there.
---
lol so true xD
---
Eye of Flame on my mage. 
---
Got it from an Elite mob I had to kite and kill near Blackrock Mountain trying to get to a Black Lotus. I was soo excited, still have it in that mage’s bank.
---
This is one of those pathetic posts trying to get some sort of sympathy from this sub when its actually just a weird flex. Grats you got Grand Marshal in a game 15 years ago, we are so proud of you like your parents never were.
---
it has funny pictures my dude no one wants to read about people discussing a 15 year old video game
---
&gt;This is exactly the game moon landing deniers play. "I am confused by a potato video - unless you can make me not confused, to my own satisfaction, that is proof there is a massive conspiracy!". One last time: neither of us knows what is going on there
---
I'm not sure why you're so hung up on the so called potato video. Can you see the abilities he's using? If you can't, you might need a better screen or a pair of glasses.
---
&gt;That does close the gap between pirate server times and retail vanilla times significantly. Getting it done in under half the time is still a stretch to credibility given the skill ceiling in WoW, but much less than getting it done in one third the time.
---
This is not strictly about the skill ceiling, though using the incorrect rotation does matter quite a bit. The main difference is this:
---
The retail Vanilla speedrun uses 25 DPS out of which 5 are memespecs and the rest are split between melee, hunters and mages. The highest damage dealers (rogues) are a wildly suboptimal race/spec combo (dagger rogues everywhere!). People are missing a number of overpowered buffs and consumables.
---
The private server speedrun uses 31 DPS (no memespecs) with 20 melee, 6 hunters and 5 casters. People are running optimal spec/class combos while fully buffed and using all available consumables and engineering gadgets.
---
Weird flex. Seriously though, anyone who owns this has to realize it's worth thousands of dollars. "seems everyone likes these" Yeah no shit dude.
---
Why wouldn't they? When I introduce myself in another language I don't change my name. In my experience people only change names when using another language because their given name is hard to pronounce for others. For instance I have a few friends from when I lived in Japan who were foreign exchange students in America for a while. They used American names to make it easier on everyone. I would imagine that they still use the regular names in Classic.   
---
I could be wrong though.
---
Haha lmao I love Asmongold too xDDDDDD
---
The wand is made at about level 10, and although I don't have the data on me I can tell you that the time required to make the wand that is not part of the normal leveling process itself is somewhere around 15-30 minutes.
---
No such luck
---
Obviously not
---
My guild was a small group of five friends, just finished college, along with our alts.  We were scattered around the country, and we missed each other, and wow was our way to stay in touch and hear each other's voices and hang out.  We never even did raids.  All we could do was run instances, but that was okay with us.  By the end of vanilla we were lucky enough to have a few extra healers and tanks so we didn't have to ask anyone in if one of us wanted a change of pace playing dps.  It was a good time then and it's going to be a good time again.  We're all going to be playing together.  I can't wait to run my night elf hunter over to Westfall to meet up with my buddies.  It's gonna be awesome.
---
A lot of people act like it's stupid to care about just how much fun it is to play a game like this with your friends, but man, I pity people who've never had that experience.  Jumping on Vent at noon my time and hearing my friends across the country already laughing and joking around, everyone drinking a beer and having a good time getting pots ready and checking the auction house.  Wiping in DM because we didn't know what the hell we were doing.
---
It was good times then and it's going to be good times again.  Anything that gives you a good reason to spend that much time with your friends?  Shit, that's the best.
---
Yes, eye opening. I look forward to watching all of you get hard stuck on garr or some other joke ass MC encounter. 
---
Tell that to the 12 level 60's i've leveled on Private x1 exp servers over the last 2 years. It wont be half as good, it will be twice as good.
---
why?
---
I suppose ask yourself this. Pick two games you currently play and try to imagine yourself dedicating yourself to them in 2035.
---
I like this. Do you have any others?
---
I bought his Agamand Mills painting, totally worth it.
---
Destiny, also from Un'goro!
---
Bud, your name is HunterGaming, and your password for WoW is probably the same with a 1 at the end. Definition of Cringe.
---
I just leveled there today, from 10-14. Nice timing.
---
Fully cannot tell if this is sarcasm.
---
If I was another place in my life, I would buy the fuck out of all those pictures, and the maps posted recently. I love them. 
---
There’s nothing difficult about leveling, running dungeons for gear, or doing any entry level raids or obtaining BiS gear. 
---
It is definitely time-consuming to level, run dungeons for gear, gather 40 people for a raid and then complete the entry level raid. It is also time consuming to get BiS gear. 
---
What makes these things easier? A close knit guild of people that have MMO experience, or preferably, Vanilla experience. Having a group of knowledgeable friends in a guild alongside you makes every aspect of the game more time-efficient, also making it easier. 
---
What is difficult about the game? Higher tier raids (more intensive mechanics) and  arguably PvP. 
---
Almost every aspect of vanilla that is “difficult” isn’t really difficult at all, it’s only time-consuming.
---
Having a close knit guild of like-minded players and a wealth of information on any topic only a google search away cuts down on the time-consuming aspect immensely. 
---
The game was never actually hard. It was the lack of knowledge that led us to perceive it as difficult.  Our ignorance made it difficult. No one knew any strats for any bosses and when a guild found it out, they didn’t share it, because they had the edge. Now you’d have to try to be ignorant, there’s just no excuse. But of course, when it comes down to it, you can know how to fight a straightforward boss like Rag but you’d still wipe constantly if your guild wasn’t informed or geared enough to beat him. The game will be difficult for those who can’t or don’t spend enough time in it. 
---
option 1: level tailoring
---
option 2: profit from selling the mats you would use to level tailoring.
---
Unless you are going super fucking try hard and your guild is going for server 1st rag, the robes aren't worth it and neither is tailoring.
---
Yes, my wife will be playing Classic WoW with me.  
---
I had her play Retail with me when BFA first came out, she liked the idea of the game, but hated that expansion for all the reasons I did.  I then had her play the Demo with me and she loved it, and told me she’d be more than happy to play several hours a day when it released!
---
Pretty sure we’re going to do a Hunter/Warrior combo with our roommate playing a Shaman. 
---
Damnit, this was my first thought when I read the title.
---
Go into the mountains and freeze yourself, then wake up in the far distant future and battle the otters for the last classic wow server.
---
The art/paintings have been amazing here recently. I enjoy it much more than all the reposting. 
---
&gt;Guess you didn't read the thread then sweetie.
---
&gt;sweetie
---
holy fuck you are a massive tool.
---
Can't wait to get those Goldshire tells baby!
---
I still remember the first time I made it to the Sepulcher back in vanilla. Finding a new hub after leaving the starting zone made the world seem so huge already. Time to kill some wolves. 
---
Will do, at the moment I've been thinking of going on an Australian server since that would fall right into peak hours for them and will make finding groups easier.
---
Amazing work love it, what is up with all the negativity?
---
ok thank you
---
Not playing a Warlock or having an alch alt.
---
Terrible.
---
All my locks sported Robes of Doan.  There was great caster gear in that place!  You had to brave the worgen, before they were the worgen!
---
&gt;Level 12 Undead
---
&gt;Deathknell Crypt
---
:thinking:
---
Imagine raiding naxx with 39 otters. That would be awesome
---
1: faster kill time is almost always better than slower kill time and extra damage taken. Definitely wrong on saying nightfall a waste.
---
2: the mana from spirit (even with imp. drain soul) is reaaaally marginal. Like, the mana cost of using rank 1 drain soul is 55, and the mana back from imp. drain soul is about 200-300 at lvl 60 with no spirit gear. Not dismissing this totally out of hand but I'd need to see some numbers to show that spirit was better than spell damage, esp. at low levels.
---
3: agree
---
Thankfully my planned alts; what struggle there is is going to be mitigated. Gonna have an alchemist, an enchanter and a miner/herbalist spread between a mage, lock and priest with the warrior proper being a miner/blacksmith.
---
Then I'm going to spend a lot of time in Goldshire and have sets of copper gear ready for everyone leaving Northshire. Gonna have people all over Elwynn seeing my name whenever they open up their inventory screen for weeks. 
---
Exactly. I don't get how people keep confusing time consuming with hard. They are different concepts. 
---
That feel when games from 2004 are still the best games
---
You can log in, mess around or take breaks. It doesn't matter what you do because you're not rushed like current xpacs! Must log in to do dailies, neck or weapon Ap grinds (yawn) that unlock spells and effects? No thanks. Open chests for random rng rewards once a week! NOPE! Classic here we come baby! 
---
step on her
---
Mind sharing that? I’m going Mage too! 
---
Oh man, Millencolin, I love you for mentioning them
---
*I DONT CAAAAAAARE WHEEEEEERE I BELONG NO MOOOOOOOORE*
---
Don't you usually need to find 39 otter people to raid with?
---
Vanilla was never HaRd 
---
But the little mechanics that existed were super punishing if you were not prepared for them 
---
I have been playing vanilla for probably longer than 99% of the people here.  The beauty of this game is it encourages interaction and helps build social structures.  I have a /played time in the years of just vanilla, just my retail account had close to 200 days played when TBC launched, add on to that close to a decade on private realms.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It is not the content or the challenge that keeps me playing, it is the community.  I want to achieve things on a single character, chances are I need some help from either a fellow crafter or a healer or 39 guildies for BWL.  Everyone plays to progress in their chosen direction, and along the way you interact with others looking for similar assistance and co-operation.
---
I have gamed with people 20 years younger than me and 20 years older.  I have met racists and devout religious believers.  I have met communists, capitalists and environmentalists.  I have met great PEOPLE.  That is what I love about wow and this community, I get to meet new people learn new things and share experiences.  I have known some people a decade that I speak to twice a year and people I have known six months that I speak to daily.
---
Everyone has a different thing that triggers the "magic" whether it be killing a raid boss or getting r14 or just making a friend for life. 
---
I agree the magic is still there.
---
Cmon, Cmon...
---
Counting to 1 million is easy, but it takes a long time.
---
such a fucking drama queen jesus christ
---
different guilds can be totally different experiences too :D
---
Sorry for the late reply, was out getting food. Regarding the server size, it appears the candid video that tipsoutbaby took at the weird angle has been deleted from twitch, which is BB said that they were exploring increasing the server size for a better community feel.
---
What we do have is the WoWHead interview that happened after
---
"Have you determined what server population caps will be? Back in Vanilla they were between 2,500 and 3,000. Are you considering raising those or keeping them as they were back in the day?
---
BB: That's actually not how it works, it's not an exact cap like number of players online, but we're looking at those as the kinds of things we were talking about, trying to find out solutions to provide a level of stability and also a sense of overall community. 
---
JH: We certainly have the ability of providing a higher realm population than we had back in the day. The good news is, we can dial it, trying to put in everyone that we can before the server CPU is melted."
---
We should note from the classicast with john staats and mark kern is where they gave the 2k and 2.5k number. Anyway, I read the above as a strong indication that the server cap will be raised, especially in light of them literally modelling their release after a private server, and just recently making a new change to make classic even more in line with private servers.
---
Regarding warriors and them being changed, I was just giving you an illustrative list, it was not exhaustive. They actually received some form of rebalancing in 1.2, 1.3, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7 (relevant change is to shield slam here), 1.8, 1.9, 1.11. I'd say 1.4 is was not substantive and 1.10 was mostly bug fixes (which did change the balance, but were likely changed in early hotfixes after 1.9 and only reported in 1.10). 
---
You can see for yourself here: https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.10.0
---
(to navigate, delete the ending and just put in the patch you want. If you delete the 10.0 part and just put in 9, it will automatically fill in the rest and bring you to the patch 1.9 page). 
---
&gt;A similar example for me would be Diablo 2 which I still play to this day years later. Now the game hasn't been updated in years while having recieved lots of updates in the past. Is the game now "less Diablo" because it hasn't received updates in forever? No, I don't think so and I would argue so would most Diablo fans. The game is just as it was once it stopped getting updates. This is what I want with classic. I want it to be like TBC never came out.
---
To be honest, I never played Diablo 2. However it seems a bit odd to me to make comparisons between the two. I can't imagine updates were as core a part of the soul of the game as WoW. Let me ask the reverse question - if Blizzard started making new updates for diablo II, would that make it "less Diablo" than it was before?
---
I mean after leaving WC3 alone for like a decade, Blizzard started updating it last year. They've done some pretty substantial rebalancing (especially of heroes). However these have been very well received in the community, and nobody is saying "oh man because you nerfed blademaster but buffed keeper of the grove, it's just not wc3 anymore." 
---
They will smash kelthuzads skull like a clam on their tummy
---
Exactly what i was thinking when reading this thread title.
---
Good call OP
---
It definitely wasn't part of greater lordaeron. Think about it, it's called the sepulcher, lol.
---
It was just a graveyard along the roadside to lordaeron before sylvanas and the forsaken took over.
---
They're related. Learning another language is hard. Running a marathon is hard. Getting rank 14 on bg9 in 2006 is hard. Anyone that's below average intelligence/talent can achieve these things but it would take a lot of time. That doesn't mean its not hard.
---
This is the sepulcher in silverpine Forrest, not undead starting area.
---
in another 20 years wow will get similar recognition and praise that Star Wars does now, who knows we may even have WoWIV(the hunt for makrisk wife) by then :p
---
Sl/sl arena geared lock + resto druid was HILARIOUS. Literally. Unkillable.
---
you sir understand the original ethos of the game IMO, this is exactly how I started a life in vanilla wow.
---
[Dark Lady watch over you](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oSF4keDUM5E)
---
On a private server, sure, with a corrupt GM team, right.
---
I would add that no one is looking for a Prot or Ret pally. If you prove yourself competent to friends, they'd let you tank 5 mans if there wasn't a Warrior or Feral Druid available or possibly OT/OH 10-20 mans. With Ret, I think many guilds are willing to take 1 Ret pally on raids. 
---
I think people often look at the fact that the Ret brings less DPS than other melee DPS, which is true, but often the wrong way to look at it. If heals are covered, but you need blessings and dispels, a Ret can bring that while bringing more DPS than a superfluous Holy Pally would bring.
---
Obviously PVP is an entirely different beast.
---
Also, sure, Ret and Prot pallys might not be wanted in raids, but neither are Demonology and Destruction Warlocks. Neither are Arms warriors, etc.
---
The difficulty in vanilla wow is investing time and forming relationships, the gameplay itself is easy.
---
This is the reason i love undead. Silverpine Forest is my favorite place next to Desolace. 
---
What class should you play if you want to melt someone's face?
---
You're a right to left convert as well?
---
Whether it'll be as easy as they say or not will entirely depend on if Blizzard respect the 2500 server cap. If they don't, we'll have a private-server like experience--I am really hoping they stick to 2500.
---
My concern with that being is with a 2500 cap then it may very well require additional servers... which will promptly be abandoned, creating ghost towns, after all the tourists leave.
---
not to mention the utility you bring in group content such as elite quests and dungeons.
---
One of my favorite times was leveling a prot warrior with all of the pvp talents like the revenge stun or improved disarm. I dunno how good it was compared to other options but it was unique and fun.
---
That’s definitely not happening. He breaks the root, charges and stuns, you root and cheese it.
---
There isn’t a hope in hell of a Druid beating a warrior with this kind of gear without the generous use of consumables.
---
I pretty much only listened to The Pot when grinding honour in AV during the 2.0 vanilla patch. 
---
I sincerely don't understand when people say that rogue leveling bottom tier, it's most certainly faster than warrior, paladin, priest, and shaman at nearly every point in the process provided you have decent weapons. Which you should, considering there is PLENTY of leather melee gear to be found while leveling, so buying a weapon now and then is fine.
---
 
---
Even if you have specced everything into sub you can get a slow MH sword and facetank and mobs 1v1 and you have sap and vanish if you run into trouble which is far more than warriors have.
---
Even the private server experience reignited all those feelings for me, it’s more than nostalgia. classic was just a great game
---
It was said at the time, there was so many issues about tbc that were ignored when the players brought them up.  This was the time IMO where Blizz got arrogant and thought the players opinions were worth ignoring.
---
They're plate now?? Wtf.
---
I feel like factions will be fairly even on most servers since a lot of people will roll ally for the pve meta and more memorable nostalgic experience (for most) and a lot of retail plays will roll horde since its by far the most popular faction there and some of the more pvp oriented players too.
---
Lordaeron took up a lot of space, basically everything north of the lake. Not to mention all the northern kingdoms united under lordaeron. so when I look at this picture and can't tell the difference between a sunny deathknell and a tiny sepulcher, I try and grab it all with "good old Lordaeron"
---
I feel super lucky. I remember the magic of vanilla because I played it for several months...but I only ever got to level 58 before BC came out. And the only vanilla raid I've ever done, even after all these years, is part of AQ 20, and maybe BRS once during BC. 
---
I never played the onyxia remake...nor the ZG remake. Even on Nost, I took my time playing a bunch of different class/race combos and was having a blast, had 3 or 4 toons in the mid 30s, but never capped.
---
For me, this will be like fresh new content...except its old wow, so its the style of game I used to love, but fell out of touch with during wrath/cata because it just wasn't my cup of tea anymore.
---
I. Am. Stoked. 
---
Do you have the artists name please?
---
Molten Core is definitely a face roll raid, shit you could have 5 DPS be afk for most of the fights and not even notice 
---
Oof
---
From range they destroy everything, 1v1 rogues can stand a chance but if they are orc its like a 80% chance you're dead if they get a stun resist
---
Super fucking tryhard is going engineering.
---
Neat
---
The tauren flight master in Silithus has the best name in Swedish.
---
The YouTube national anthem?
---
A good balance druid in blue rank 10 pvp gear would destroy him are you kidding me?
---
I hate picking classes that can’t 1v1 cause all I do is pvp so I’ll have to look up a lot of videos 
---
Nice!
---
Yeah if you are gonna spend so many hours leveling it may as well be enjoyable :)
---
Don't level a prot warrior it was hard af and if you aggro more than 1 at any given time you are dead. Also kill times are slow it's just slow. 
---
Back at you, friend.
---
Joanna's guide is completely worthless for a fresh server. 
---
I love that weapon...I miss the class design and pre raid gearing of BC...fucking perfect man
---
Yeah I feel you.
---
And absolutely agree, definitely a very talented dude.
---
Dude, I was gonna mention SL lock lmao yea such a nightmare class to deal with in BGs as well.
---
Instantly saw this as the Sepulcher. 
---
I thought only brand new sealed are they worth that much.  Used much less.  I'd never sell it though.
---
There actually is cross realm battlegrounds in 1.12. It's actually the patch they added it in.
---
He doesn't do anything special like some, but him and Echeyakee were the best looking cats in the game imo.  Nothing like them until Loque came along.
---
Definitely have had this happen to me

Weekday raid times (EST player here)
---
Hello all, looking for a guild with the aforementioned traits. 
---
I played retail classic. I have raided retail naxx as a rogue and holy paladin. As a holy priest, and warlock I raided everything else.
---
I plan on rolling human rogue (combat swords). 
---
Can't do hardcore anytime raiding anymore but if you're looking for an experienced player who always brings their A game let me know via pm
---
I think that is true if you try to follow it perfectly, but it still gives good guidance on what zones to go to at what level to help reduce wasted time while traveling.
---
Before seeing the guide I would just go to a quest hub and do all the quests there, or as many as I could, before moving on to the next quest hub. That led to the problem of getting to a new quest hub and half the quests are green which means I need to kill green mobs and get less xp.
---
After seeing the guide I know that it is better to do only some of the quests at one hub, and then some at another, and then return to finish rest, so that I am usually always killing quest mobs that are yellow and so I get more xp for the same amount of time spent.
---
But yes I think if you try to follow it exactly then you will end up getting stuck trying to complete particular quests for longer than it is worth.
---
I agree, but I’d like to double check names like Egan Peltskinner aren’t being translated into whatever Peltskinner would be in another language. 
---
We’re marking maps and it’s the difference between pasting the name as part of the image or overlaying the map with a text version of the name so it translates. 
---
I hope snoman comes back and does a new dreamscape for classic!
---

---
You can’t just leave it there :)
---
Retail feels like more of a job than Vanilla ever did.
---
Most common non-gathering profession is try-hard? Are you braindead?
---
You're not wrong. TBC was the pinnacle of class design. Every class felt unique and different. Each one had strengths and weaknesses...and it felt damn GOOD. Balance was about emphasizing the fun parts of classes, not just making everyone exactly the same. 
---
Who said anything about merging servers? Where are you getting that idea from?
---
30 point in 3min, not bad :D
---
Shaman can't dual wield in Vanilla.
---
I'm taking more of the end game portion of it. 
---
Ohh i see what you are saying with names like that. I don't think they did in vanilla but that doesn't mean they will this time around. I tried googling it and couldn't find anything about it.
---
No, shaman hard counter casters 1v1 and mail + shield destroys rogues. Hunters druids and warriors might stand a chance.
---
But why? Just to make it inconvenient on us, or is this the lead up to you trying to sell us something? 
---
Because it feels like it is. 
---
Frost shock is a ranged snare, earth shock is a ranged interrupt.
---
A shaman isn't going to go up against an Orc in pvp.
---
Don't forget first aid. In all seriousness, if you have a gathering profession and AH a few stacks of mats every now and then you'll never go poor.
---
Vanilla is balanced around 1v1 so every class can 1v1.
---
31. No +hit, spell damage, spell crit or ranged attack power on character screen.  
---
32. You can't cast max rank buffs on low level players.  
---
33. You can't interact with npcs at all in druid/shaman form.   
---
34. You can't talk to npcs while mounted, and you won't auto dismount to talk or cast a spell. You have to click dismount and then do the action.  
---
Sounds like you sit in a 2h and die to rogues instead of using 1h/shield.
---
There's one server, sharded into multiple numbers. This is what sharding is. Forget my idea, you seem to not be understanding the core concept.
---
Just wait until release!
---
 [don’t rebind r, used for whispers]

that's a massive yikes from me dawg

Kill them because the sound female gnomes make when they die sounds like the old SEGA commercials and it makes me happy every time.

2. WOW, totally forgot about that one :D you had to go through your spellbook to find the right buff for their level :D 
---
Anything that's considered hard takes a lot of time. 
---
This is 100% not controversial.  You'd have to have brain damage to think vanilla talents were better.
---
That being said, it's still a valid opinion that we should stick with vanilla talent trees.
---
Gotta mention it casually once a week to cultivate the idea.
---
Here is a text version of the video pretty much, for those who prefer to read! :)   
---
1. To get full ranks to some spells, you had to get a codex or a spellbook, as a drop in the open world or dungeons
---
2. respecc costs a maximum of 50gold and the ammount reduces by 5g every month you spend without respeccing
---
3. PVP trinkets didnt dispell all CC's, they only dispell 3, the ones beeing dispelled depends the class you play
---
4. You have to talk to the battlemaster to be queued for PVP
---
5. You have no quest helper, you need to read the quests and explore
---
6. Vanilla wow has actual weather effects
---
7. Vanilla wow used to have a day and night cycle with really dark nights
---
8. Quests for dungeons, are spread all around the world and not just conveniantly waiting at the entrence of the dungeon
---
9. You have to watch your threat level in dungeons and raids so you dont pull aggro, remember the phrase let the tank get a few sunders?
---
10. Elite and group mobs are actually elite and require a group
---
11. Your mount and riding skill without any discounts costs 100g at lvl 40 and 1000g at lvl 60
---
12. You have to actually find the flight masters your self, you dont just get them
---
13. Mounts have a 3 seconds casting time instead of 1.5 seconds
---
14. If you wipe in a raid or dungeon, you would respawn at a graveyard, not at the entrence
---
15. You cant have a horde and alliance character on the same pvp server
---
16. All classes have an extra weapon slots, wand for casters, range weapon for rogue and warrior, relic for shaman and so on.
---
17. No phasing,instancing or cross realm zones, if you are in the barrens, you see EVERY single player that is in the barrens
---
18. raids required you to do an attunement quest
---
19. There is no instant delivery mail, not even between your own characters
---
20. Classes needed reagents to be able to use greater buffs
---
21. You have to actually learn your skills from a skill trainer
---
22. You could only play paladin as alliance and shaman as horde
---
23. Weapon skill, you had to train your skills for each weapon, if you used a new weapon type you would miss most of your attacks, and do low damage
---
24. You needed resistance gear for some raid encounters
---
25. You needed a certain PVP rank to be able, to enter the hall of legends where you bought PVP gear
---
26. There is no PVP stat like resilience
---
27. 90% of the vanilla dungeons have been revamped or modified in some way in later expansions
---
28. Set items were 8 pieces, and they dropped directly as gear from bosses
---
29. Debuff limit on bosses was 8 and later changed to 16, meaning classes couldnt use some of their skills, to not take up a debuff slot
---
30. There is no achievements in Vanilla
---
I think raids will be too easy relative to the old days considering everything is documented and we have all this experience under our belts. Back in the day we ran MC if we had at least 30 and still get a few bosses down.
---
Not only these events, but are the silithus unlock event, and the scourge invasion even in also? I hope so. I really liked the scourge event, and never got to see the AQ event. Also, I know they fixed it, but it would be fun to have a brief period of the old cursed blood.
---
We have zero add ons for Classic until beta at a minimum comes out. It’s Legion base LUA (the code add ons use) with Vanilla tables sandwiched on top. 
---
Vanilla, pserver, Legion and current retail add ons as they are right now are unlikely to work on Classic. 
---
See how long it takes to kill the 58 warrior in this video? That rogue is better than you will ever be and what he did wouldn't have worked against a gnome or dwarf. If he was hemo it would have been the same thing except bleed kiting. It only works on  people that play humans, nightelves and non Orc on Horde on PvP servers. You know... People with an IQ lower than room temp. When you find a warrior who knows to pool rage and learns that stunned targets can't dodge? You lose. Most warriors are thankfully awful. Except for the ones who were rogues and rerolled to warriors because they are simply better on 1.12

One was 10 levels lower than the players running it and was still more difficult.

---
We can float in the great sea holding hands with otters! Ya know like otters do with other otters!
---
I went with a solid compromise.
---
Rolling a Priest like I did back in og Vanilla, but going Alliance this time for a partially different experience. Super excited!
---
I totally forgot about the new tool album coming out.  Ooh blasting NEW tool songs while grinding?  *pre-nuts*
---
What happened to retail wasn't a slippery slope, it was a culmination of irreversibly bad decisions that kept stacking on to eachother. 
---
Once you add arena (which Rob Pardo said they regret: https://www.engadget.com/2009/11/13/blizzard-arenas-were-a-mistake/) you can't remove it. Once you add flying (https://massivelyop.com/2015/04/02/wow-factor-flying-ruined-everything-and-shouldnt-be-removed/) you can't remove it. Once you add dungeon finger (Wrath) you can't remove it.
---
None of this will ever exist in Classic - Blizzard REGRETS them.
---

Jintha’alor was monstrous. 5 people needed to go all the way up, then continue roaming for all mobs required. Was NOT just a one way trip and done. We legit grinded there for hours to get that trinket. And it’s fuckin dope. All trinkets before that are situational, this was the first one adding flat AP. Completing that was like, YUGE
---
I’ve been focusing on alliance side speed running for the past couple of years. In my experience, a smart combo of both is the most effective. 
---
For example Darkshore is full of both quests and mobs, so you grind on everything while you travel about completing quests - very effective. 
---
Later in Ashenvale the second half of the chain quests there, even with devoted smart pathing, is lower XP than just grinding because of the distances involved. 
---
At some levels grinding for extended periods of time results in being able to make later quest hubs more compact and effective. 
---
It really comes down to smart planning rather than sticking to one or the other. 
---
I don't see why they would use the OG skins and not the updated skins we all know and love.
---
When there’s a reward involved people can get really merciless with ganking. It would be cool on a server with an even population but if one side is heavily outnumbered it would just end up with people camping the shit out of lower levels to farm honor. 
---
This type of thing has already come up on private servers where one side has a huge queue time. They go out in the world and camp flight paths and just farm people. 
---
As much as I like world pvp it’s probably best that bg’s give the best reward. 
---
I don't think they're wrong in saying it will never compare to back in the day. That doesn't mean it won't be an amazing experience regardless. 
---
Personally, I'm not trying to have the same experience I had back then. I just want to play a game that I loved that is currently not available to be(officially)
---
He’s saying orc sham rng&gt;ally rogues 
---
He means you couldn't have more than 321 members in a guild in vanilla as the total. After that the invite member button turned grey and unusable. I'm not sure if that was a thing since launch or if it was added in a later patch, though. If this was during vanilla and you're absolutely certain your guild had 420 members in it (whether that includes alts or not doesn't matter) then they must have made the cap 321 in a later patch.
---
Anyone who thinks Vanilla WoW is easy needs to do an LBRS run for their Ony attunement with a druid healer.
---
The ganking would get entirely out of hand. It could potentially ruin entire zones for people trying to level.
---
During the first month or two there will be people in every zone, try to team up with someone be it friend or random even for normal quests. The difference in playing solo and duo is like night and day, even if you are two warriors.
---
I have a really hard time imagining how this would work. If you did give a big enough reward for world pvp that people wanted to do it, you would just end up with a massive raid/zerg of players going around killing everyone, and anyone on the other faction would log off or go somewhere else. There's just no way it would result in a fun gameplay experience.
---
no - because there was a large number of complaints about art work and graphical content taking over the reddit - in future I'll post a link to everything I've done so far and everyone will have the oppertunity to get one they missed.
---
I have no intentions of selling anything.
---
I will be creating a map addon for Classic at some point, but that is my only intention at present.
---
Invite her to the upcoming gnome punting sports event.
---
Tomato Soup
---
I love the style, feels very wispy
---
It’s on your end dude. Quality is crisp as hell on my end. Can see everything crystal clear.
---
The significant other IS classic.
---
What I meant to say is when you open the door to sharding why stop at the lower levels when there will be other big events where whole servers will be gathered in a single zone and it will be a clusterfuck. Why wouldn't they use it there as well if they have done so already and people seem to defend them for it? Don't want sharding, I don't care if servers crash or I have to wait hours in queue. I rather experience everything the way it's meant to.
---
I care
---
An acceptable answer. 
---
play retail 
---
Agreed. So many different zones and environments in vanilla; it was amazing. Retail is so bland now
---
Yeah, I am too. Better log on every week and do your +10 mythic key, your warfront(s), your WQ emissaries, clear your cap for the weed, do your island expeditions weekly, cap your conquest for the week, and make sure you do a few arena games to keep your loot box for next week!
---
Every content patch: Time for all your time you invested to be reset back to zero! New season!
---
Vanilla: Log on, slowly progress towards your goal, log off. Your goal doesn't reset every week. There are no gear resets/seasons.
---
Can't switch while you're stunned right?  PVP trinket is 5 minutes, otherwise you have to sit through cheap shot/kidney and eat tons of free damage. Rogues with t2 / t3 weaps absolutely destroy you before you can even switch weapons, and then what?  You're at half HP or worse, and nerf your damage potential by a huge amount.  
---
Rogues are just the rock/paper/scissors winning engagement over enh sham.  In a straight up 1v1 with all things (gear/skill/situation) being equal you won't usually win. 
---
BGs would give the best reward, especially you have to compete with too many players for World PvP kill as you said.
---
Fair point. 
---
baeby /u/xmarkish ! Didnt you have some dank cosplay outfit lol do you have a screenshot? You had like the westfall lamp or some shit iirc
---
You.. are a monster
---
Honor Kills in World PvP give like nothing compared to winning a Battleground. Battlegrounds would still be the best way to farm honor, but you could alternatively World PvP and rank up. 
---
Try to think of every way someone can get an easy kill and that's what will happen.
---
Every flight point, instance entrance etc. would be camped 24-7.
---
It's a PvP server. Besides I don't think the ganking would get out of hand, considering battlegrounds would give faster honor since you get bonus for winning. 
---
I rather play from minute 1. The fresh experience is what makes vanilla special not after a few weeks my friend-o.
---
No way... Tool, Bad Religion, and RAMMSTEIN mixing an album right now... omg.
---
What's the point of World PvP if there is no reward? The honor given from World PvP kills should be increased. 
---
People and guilds would just collude on discord and kill each other to get rank. Rank 14 is overrated anyways on almost every class. The amount of good players that were rank 14 on my real vanilla server that were good I could count on one hand. None were great. Private servers are another matter. They won't represent the Classic playerbase in anyway, especially on US servers. EU is much more try hard.
---
**What class are you playing that you think you need rank 14 gear anyways?** 
---
Could you post the link here? That would be super duper
---
The most epic part of this photo is how well the armor matches.

My friend was saying a lot of people are gonna dislike it he never played classic so I don’t really listen to him because he doesn’t know how awesome classic felt.

&lt;Team Orange&gt; | Server: NA-PvP | Alliance
---
We are a well rounded guild looking for members in all aspects of the game! We want to create a high end raid team to be competitive in content as it is released, as well as running premade battlegrounds and other more competitive PvP as it becomes available! Max level and high stress content is not all we are searching for, we want a community feel in the guild so more casual players are welcome! This includes members that love to do professions, quest and run dungeons with guildies, and plan to have alt raids as well as more laid back group with the more casual players.
---
We expect all members to act and behave in a respectful manner to one another, no matter how hardcore or casual they are! The goal is to make a large efficient community that can work together to make the game more appealing and take the edge of the grind that is Vanilla WoW! We expect all of our raiders to learn their class and a good understanding of the fights going into new content.
---
We are currently recruiting all classes for the main raid group, as well as some team leaders, main tank, dps lead, heal lead, and even a raid leader/ strat caller if it comes to it. Outside the raiding world we need members that will take charge over PvP runs and even dungeon groups and keeping guildies involved. Officers and veteran members are what make great guilds!
---
A raid schedule has not been set yet, as we are all adults now time is not as open a resource so it is something that will need to be discussed in some depth, getting 40 people together is quite a task. 
---
You can reach me here thru this post, or the brand new guild site (it is still a work in progress, it was just created). Any member looking for a leadership role reach out to me!
---
SEGA! :)
---
Most rank 14 players just farmed battlegrounds 24/7. Obviously it wasn't about skill. 
---
I am not saying making farming players in World PvP the fastest way to rank up. I am saying to increase the honor from World PvP kills to at least make it a viable alternative. 
---
Awesome. 
---
Yep. There are some pretty nifty macros/addons that do the same. They'll need to be recreated for classic WoW, assuming it's still possible through the new API.
---
Is it? It's been years and years since I played my night elf druid, but I could have sworn the Hearthstone is the arms-up animation, while Healing Touch and Regrowth were both hands-at-side animation.
---
The only spell that immediately strikes me as using the same animation as Hearthstone is Wrath, and you have no reason to counterspell that. So this doesn't work for night elves, which is the only race with any kind of green healing on the Alliance at least.
---
Remember, the more you spend the better you'll be /s

Sounds like you've never actually played pvp vanilla then.
---
Gearscore in classic? Heresy! 
---
What class are you playing? Also they will get reported by other premades and will get punished for it. It's easy to police if they don't have cross realm BG's and if they do then it would be hard to achieve. 
---
Disagree. Dealing with murlocs in vanilla is difficult. 
---
Saying Vanilla WoW is easy is kind of like saying Dark Souls is easy. Of course DS is easy if you know every boss mechanic, every loot location, and the ideal stat/gear build at every level. But most players don’t, and so they get blown back by the first crazed undead in the first zone. 
---
Vanilla is the same way. You might think you’re hot shit tearing your way through deadmines, until you get backstabbed by that patrol you forgot about and suddenly you’re corpse running your way back to the instance, half your group is lost in ghost form because you didn’t hold their hand on the run back and the tank took res sickness because he’s a complete scrub.
---
I totally get it man. Take your time, looking forward to it! :)
---
How will it lessen the amount of dead servers then? 
---
Scatter shot, feign death+freezing trap, aspect of the cheetah for my life.
---
My mum got to raid AQ as a boomy sometimes.. 
---
Ive never experienced people being talked down to in Vanilla regarding their specs, and i was in a guild that cleared AQ40. Obviously there were damage and healing meters, so as long as you performed, your spec was not examined up and down.
---
I dont think that will entirely be the case this time around. Retail WoW has trained players to play "optimally" which in turn has resulted in a cookie cutter game, where everyone plays the same, does the same rotation with the same mindset. 
---
Ive heard of people getting dragged into private "discussions" on discord regarding their builds. I had a friend who was a Frost Mage in early Legion, and he was told by his officers that he had to change build or he wouldnt get to raid. And this was a casual guild that raided twice a week. They are now 1/8 (or is it 9) in the newest raid.
---
I dont get why there is such a rush to beat the content in any MMO, beating the last raid means the game is over. Its essentially a rush to be done with the game, yet its a game people have been for for years.
---
I don't get why people are so hell bent on reviving World PvP... It is almost like they never played through the era that had it. 
---
When something becomes successful, the money sharks move in and take over.
---
Many of the people who understood the philosophy behind classic wow are long gone from blizzard. They got replaced and overpowered by marketing MBA types. Sure they played the game, but they never understood why WoW was successful and implemented changes based on short term player desires. More loot, faster travel, etc. A million QoL changes they thought were good ideas because they just played the game, they werent the men behind the curtain who understood the fundamental principles.
---
It happens in every industry that requires genius. The real geniuses end up making 50k a year somewhere or broke. The guys who designed the code for windows (navy program)and developed the microchip for the military end up poor while the marketing guys make millions.

I think it’s nightmare blade and not maladath because shit looks pretty green. Maybe I’m wrong though 
---
BRUH. I've been telling everyone this. The MMO scene is dead.
---
I have to agree. If people can get a ton of honor from ganking then STV will turn into no one questing. STV would be tarren mill/SS 2.0. A lot of people gank without any incentive... give people an incentive and it will only get that much worse.
---
No matter what your long-term proffessions, it helps to take up Herbalism just for that quest to find the gloom/doom weeds - since the trainer is right nearby anyway and you can just unlearn it if you choose to afterwards

Warden staff

If you're a competent and polite player nobody will care about your talents in 5 mans, especially if you form the group.
---
For raids it depends on your guild. In progression raiding your guild will probably require you to fill a specific role. If your guild is short on healers and you are stubborn about playing ret I don't think you deserve a raid slot.
---
I was curious too. I found it here https://www.artstation.com/dlikt
---
"Gotta go this for all the BIG BOP!"  Are you?  Try harder, loser.
---
I don't mind cross realm battlegrounds at all personally. It's rather necessary as many server populations are one sided. And the twink queue would be god awful.
---
Maladath, the best item model, 2004-2019
---
In vanilla, while there certainly were some try-hards, most people were pretty chill.
---
The whole culture of gaming has shifted since then though, so it might be very different now.
---
It wasn't so much hostile as some specs you just couldn't raid with. Any priest that heals can pretty much get in a raid. Now as far as cutting edge you would want to be the cookie cutter spec, but cutting edge progression might get you 2 more pieces of gear in 3 months. Gear accumulation is slow in Vanilla.
---
Ret Paladin can do damage and can be carried. If you are a nice, social person I am sure you can get in a slower progress guild. Same with enhance. Fire mages just don't work in the first couple tiers. The mobs resist fire dmg because you are in a big volcano. Fire is AWESOME later on though and the best spec. You also have catch up gear with bloodvine for casters so if you flat out refused to play frost for some reason you could raid as fire later.
---
Warriors are the best dps in the game so no they aren't forced to tank. They can also tank anything but raids as dps spec and even offtank. 
---
A lot of classes have to respec for raiding and ideal pvp specs though. Mages and rogues both do. Vanilla is about time investment and gold matters a lot. There are classes that can do ok with one spec for both. Lock, Hunter. In the first two tiers most healer hybrids can get away with one. AQ and Naxx is where the difficulty goes way up. 
---
Some classes are not ideal if you have limited play time and enjoy both PVE and PVP. Warrior is very gear dependent as an example. If you have time though they are a great class that is good at lots of things and highly valued and wonderful to play with friends. 
---
That's not so much what I mean. I more mean if I try to apply as a DPS or Tank Paladin, am I going to get turned away from most raids for playing the lesser spec. I've played plenty of multiplayer games in the past, and I certainly have no problem filling roles if I can, but I don't love the idea of getting shut down for playing something that is less than the best for that role. 
---
It's funny thinking about it now. But at the time I did everything I could think of. Went through every single menu at the bottom, tried /quit party, tried typing /quit in party chat. It never occurred to me that you could right click your character frame.
---
You don't need herbalism to do the quest
---
The hardest part in all of Vanilla was for AQ40 guilds to retain a roster in the summer months.
---
Back in the day not really. On private servers kind of. I remember playing a ret pally back in vanilla wow and joining an mc pug where all pallys were told to heal regardless of spec. I healed in full damage gear with the unstopable force equipped and won the roll for light forge boots. It was my first tier pice and was super stoked . On private servers though for pug groups they insist you get inspected on ironforge bride before they send in an invite. Since the content is kind of old I would love to see people try unconventional specs and see them work. Such boomkins and ret pallys in raids. Hardcore guilds probably won't try that at all though.
---
Of course not, but makes finding the nodes vastly easier
---
All we need now is for Mindless Self Indulgence to come off hiatus and the circle is complete. 
---
I would be horrified for any kind of cash shop on classic. A cash shop would be a dealbreaker for me.
---
I'm flattered that you remember the lesson I taught you.
---
Now, take a second and ask yourself if warlocks bring something to a group other than dps.
---
Barring mechanical issues like Affliction Warlocks (Debuff slots) and Fire Mages (MC/BWL fire resist) casual players did not really care. They still won't care when Classic comes out.

All the talk of Classic has me playing a lot of Warcraft 3 again. It's holding me over. I don't want to play on a private sever again.
---
You aren’t seeing the other side of this. Players always take the path of least resistance. Even with the current honor yield from kills being what it is people group up and endlessly camp flight points and corpse camp everyone that lands. 
---
Granted this is something that people do between bg queues but if it was further incentivized any high level zone would be a total nightmare for anyone on the receiving end of that. Maybe on servers with a perfect balance of active pvpers it would be cool, but I find that extremely unlikely. 
---
I never saw much hostility personally, however, I think most people I was with used the optimal specs. I think it will be different this go around. I hope anyways.

I'd join Jaina's and her BF's guild.

I remember PvPing with riposte spec. Pet attack was usually enough to make me parry enough to keep disarm up on the hunter like 90% of the time. Save kidney shot for when it's not up... Save vanish for the possibility of feign/freeze trap.

I only remember losing about 1/20ish duels or 1v1s against a hunter, even if he knew I was there.

All good homie
---
Roguecraft was recorded at an earlier patch before the changes to Eviscerate. Doubt it can be pulled off in 1.12
---
Same for me, got it while doing ladden dew gland quest in Tanaris, gave it wrapped in wrapping paper to my rogue friend and had his mind blown. Later got Kang axe from wintersaber in Winterspring, which was quickly sold in the AH. 
---
Or AV if its available when you're 55+. The caves, harpies, etc.
---
You get rep, honor and exp.
---
Infested with Kobolds I assume
---
I'm on the fence about this conversation.
---
In my opinion 30 points into holy will always be better for the raid as a healer. But if raiding isn't your first and foremost priority I also agree that points can be spent elsewhere expanding to expand your versatility.
---
Hypothetically, let's say DM isn't released for 3 months. You're a hardcore no-lifer and go balls to the wall rushing 60. You're in MC/Ony before the 2nd reset. DM isn't out yet and you're limited by time and gear from lack of content
---
What is your opinion on that extra 5% crit when you are starved for gear during those first few weeks/months?
---
From my own personal preraid BIS list I created; granted I'm sure there can be improvements made to it. I count 11 pieces of gear from DM that could be considered preraid worthy.

I would love to have my wife play with me.  She isn't really into "that kind of game" though.  Spyro is more her speed. We got the remaster and she loves it and will be content playing Spyro for 3-4 hours at one sitting.  We only have one computer, but that is fixable; however I just don't know if she'll be into it.  I think it might have too many different systems and layers for her to get into.  She tried Diablo 3 on the switch local multiplayer with me and couldn't follow.  She did say she would try classic, and I think it would be better than Diablo for her to have her own screen and camera controls.  I am hopeful that she will like it so we can share the experience together and spend the time playing together as opposed to apart if I'm just playing alone. 
---
Huh, this was "30 things different in retail" for me. It's been a while since I played, the game has clearly changed A LOT. How do you get flightmasters these days? That was the most confusing one for me. (Like... Do you just start with being able to fly anywhere, without having to explore?), well that and "watch your aggro". I assume people still screw up with aggro in retail too, right?
---
It's also missing the boat in feralas from feathermoon to shore. 
---
I have a feeling my SO won't stick around forever, but she's tired of current wow. So we'll see.
---
Anything but that please, bad enough you have to wear clown suits while leveling to 60 but to have to sit a few months at 60 in clown suits even if you're fully decked out is just ,yikes.
---
Realistically though the sets released in the original version prior to update were just placeholders at the time, hopefully that qualifies as worthy enough not to go with the original looks.
---
This could have been called World of Warcraft, death by a thousand cuts: a sample of 30. 
---
My first ever was a robes of insight. I will always remember how excited I was to see an epic, especially while just leveling in tanaris. 
---
There was very very little hostility in specs.
---
There was much hostility in roles. If you were a priest, you were expected to heal. If you could heal effectively as shadow, no one knew any better unless they asked for power infusion or similar.
---
The thing to remember, there was no inspecting someone and seeing their talent choices. You had to see what they were doing and know what to look for to see a few of the talents they chose, or go to battle net to see what they logged off with last.
---
I am going in with a significant other. It remains to be seen whether I come out with one... I didn’t last time... 
---
They don't get hit chance talents, pretty sure no death coil and they cause to much aggro in early endgame
---
&gt;	Almost every aspect of vanilla that is “difficult” isn’t really difficult at all, it’s only time-consuming.
---
I disagree with this somewhat. Difficult is relative. Yes, pretty much everyone can get themselves to 60 in time but relative to the leveling situation in Retail where you can sprint through zones killing 20 mobs at a time, it’s difficult. 
---
You need some patience, you need to actually think about what you’re doing, even if it’s just a little bit, and you need to accept that you’re probably going to die every now and then. 
---
But this time we they're with you. 
---
Shadow priest
---
Yeah good luck to you. I don't know the best way to get mine "into it". I know she isn't going to grasp the concept of keybinds, at least not right away (not even press B to open bags, M for map).  She just won't remember what button does what.  Guess we'll just have to wait and see once release arrives. Any tips?
---
I did, and I still LOVE world pvp. It's part of why I roll pvp servers. It's fun to roam around with a friend or two (or the few times my guild formed a 20+ level 60 raid group because lowbies or alts were getting camped). Raiding capital cities is fun.
---
But OP suggesting to incentivize it would only lead to mass scale world pvp which would be chaotic. It should be left at "fun" and not made into another way to grind honor imo.
---
My brother. I did so many Deadmines runs as Horde.
---
It took so long to get a good helm that I ended up wearing the Defias Mask for quite a while as an Orc Rogue when ganking.
---
Hey warlocks sucked early vanilla because there were different talents. Classic is coming out with 1.12 talent, which means you won’t have to worry about that, warlock’s are great. It’s true warlocks scale better with gear than most other classes, but when people are talking about warlocks sucking in vanilla, they are referring to before warlocks were buffed.
---
Actually you should be more resistant to ganks than most classes if you level deep afflic/some demo, which i believe is also the best leveling spec anyway. I would frequently kill my ganker/win 1v2s etc., even without soul link, having a health stone/soul stone on yourself/voidwalker sac or 2 makes you hard to take down, along with siphon life and curse of exhaustion from talents, and eventually the quick summon pet from demo for a second Voidwalker sacrifice.
---
What's wrong with that? if none of the dps are idiots then no one will die and you won't need a rezz, druids are actually good healers ( who would've thought).
---
&gt;[I've the finest wares in the land!](https://youtu.be/FQJXez-BpL8?t=51)
---
This is actually one of the things I'm wondering if they'll get right in the Legion client. There's a good chance it'll be bugged and they won't show up as herbs in the tracking.
---
i think its not very efficient to use aspect of the hawk during killing normal mobs, just use cheetah and keep moving, which is why i take pet health on my levelling spec
---
Wait, sharding 3 zones? What 3 zones are you referring to?
---
Good luck shocking casters that are sitting outside of shock range. Like they said, casters will eat up enhances if they’re not garbage. Then again, pretty much everyone does unless the shaman gets extra lucky. 
---
&gt;Why would they invest into tech, when they already have the tools to deal with it.
---
I'm sure a shareholder would answer this one way, and a genuine fan of the game would answer another way.
---
I don't get this joke.
---
Ok, I understand what your suggesting now.

Female human paladin named Becky checking in 
---
I'm not arguing against wpvp, I spent most of my time in vanilla in a wpvp guild. That's all I really did.
---
I'm just saying in my opinion it wouldn't be good for the game to increase rewards for wpvp.
---
Didn't need it back then, don't need it now on pservers, won't need it in Classic.
---
Mine is a clicker. She can use Keybinds, but by no mean is a exclusive to it. Like my post said, I'm gonna help her as much as possible in hopes she can stick it out to 60.
---
Show me on the mannequin where the rogue touched you
---
They could even be standing in fire and no one would notice, until they die then they'll come back to yell at the healers 
---
Thanks dude, then it's settled. I'm rolling a Warlock
---
This argument is tired. Who cares. We just want to play classic. If people think its too easy they can go play something else. 
---
FAPs and LIPs ?
---
On aggro, not really. Every tank has a big chungus AoE threat button, threat is a 100% non-issue. Tanks are primarily challenged through active mitigation usage.
---
How strange, it seems to be working just fine on my side.
---
Shadow priest 
---
Depends on the guild some are okay with meme specs but others are not. 
---
It doesn't matter if BGs give less reward, people would still get out of hand. If grinding rank via wPvP was even REMOTELY viable people are going to camp left and right. You won't even be able to step 10 feet outside of your towns in contested areas, it will take you 3-4 corpse runs just to get in any instance, etc.
---
People do world pvp because it's FUN. It's not meant to rack up huge rewards, and that's what keeps it balanced. Sure you can keep killing this level 30 in STV, but you aren't getting gear/rep/anything from doing it other than pure enjoyment. So eventually you stop because you are bored and/or would like to be more productive in game.  
---
You genuinely don't know what you're talking about. Really annoying when retards like you try to give advice. Learn your place, idiot :^)
---
Based on your clumsy attempt at an analogy I’d assume you’re not intelligent enough to grok most of it. So I’m not surprised. 
---
Or be that one rogue who got bored of DPS grabbed a devot set off the AH and spam detect traps (same or very close animation to dispel) while getting carried in raid.
---
for the unconditioned, retail, noob players, wow will be somewhat difficult and unforgiving. i'm bias in my assumption that it isn't difficult. 
---
Rogues are the most nerfed class in the game. Eviscerate has STATIC DAMAGE! Also, attack power was nerfed.
---
Love me some roguecraft
---
Rogues are scissors, warriors are rocks. Priests, mages, druids, hunters, shamans and paladins are paper. Warlocks are mushrooms.
---
Scissors beats paper, paper beats rock. Scissors also happens to beat rock until rock gets to 60, when rock becomes an unstoppable killing machine. Then rock beats paper and would beat scissors, but can't find them because scissors are invisible. That's what we call balance.
---
Hey! Pastormcfeely, I thought we told you to stay away from the storm wind cathedral square! You aren't supposed to be within 2000 yards of the storm wind orphanage anymore.
---
Yeah but at least you're kicking it in Hong Kong.
---
No your right. This sword is from the emerald dragons.
---
in legion they made it so shamans/hunters wear mail from level 1 and warriors/paladins wear plate from level 1. this means they adjusted a lot of items to compensate for that so the mail items a warrior would normally use as he leveled up were changed to plate, because i guess moving up in armor as you level is too complex for modern wow
---
Around 100g before rep reduction if you're undead or exalted with them.
---
Actual radical opinion: Vanilla talent trees are great and there is *massive* variability in *viable* specs.
---
The biggest misunderstanding people have is they only think about progression raiding PvE, or BGs PvP, and think there are limited builds.
---
But there are builds efficient in doing so many more thinks. Elite soloing builds, AoE farming builds, low level dungeon farming builds, open world PvP builds, and much more.
---
People look at the absolute min/maxing raid progression builds and think "see there is no variability."
---
The problem isn't Vanilla talent trees, it's people's expectations, myopia, and narrow mindedness.
---
&gt;No phasing,instancing or cross realm zones, if you are in the barrens, you see EVERY single player that is in the barrens
---
This is still yet to be seen.
---
What is the best Alliance healer for a warrior in PVP?  We're thinking paladin just to piss everyone off.
---
I'm torn between Hunter, Druid, Rogue, and sort of Priest. I played all of these to around level 40 in actual Vanilla, I was one of the permanent alt-oholics. I later experienced endgame Warrior tanking on a pserver.
---
Basically, I'm a bit uncomfortable with pure DPS roles, but like really weird things. Stuff like Druid Bear offtank, Disc/Shadow Weaving+PInfusion+offheals support appeal to me. But I've always really loved the Hunter pet system in vanilla, and their ability to solo farm. Likewise, some of my fondest memories of vanilla are stealth runs with my friends of dungeons and stealth raids on enemy zones: I experienced these on both my Rogue and my Druid.
---
I place Priest fairly low because I recall vividly the pain if soloing with them, and I lost that character when I inevitably fell behind my friends and could no longer do dungeons with them. But I'm quite torn between going full selfish and being a Hunter, versus gearing up for Stealth runs and team play as Rogue, or more likely Druid.
---
It's MAINLY between Hunter and Druid if I'm honest. Urgh.
---
I fully agree with this but wasn’t as brave as you are to say it. I know this won’t happen, but having TBC talents in wow classic would be amazing and offer so much more flexibility to the way classes are played. The game would go from great to incredible. 
---
I even think having the larger talent trees with the level 60 limitation would make it even more interesting than if we were playing TBC to level 70, because it means harder decisions need to be made. 
---
Leveling is much harder in vanilla and thats most of the game ill be playing. 
---
I agree with you. I’m personally not a purist. I want TBC talent trees in wow classic. That would be the perfect game in my opinion. 
---
Past few months have been a total whirlwind.  All my socks are crusted over... gonna need some new pairs
---
There is a very low hanging ceiling there against a corner. The whole raid stacks there so that if the surger knocks them back, they get knocked into the ceiling/wall corner and not off into the lava or into another mob pack. It's one of 2 pulls that are usually handled this way on the way to Lucifron. When you are jammed into that corner your camera moves closer to your character because it is against that wall.
---
As someone who played on some damn good pservers, I can tell you straight up the magic is still there. The communities are great around the better servers.
---
Delete this troll garbage 
---
&gt;Vanilla was never HaRd
---
People are wiping in Scholo because they're not nuking the ghosts *even today.*
---
If *everyone* knows exactly what they're doing and executes it perfectly, then yes, everything works smoothly.
---
But requiring everyone to have knowledge and coordination... that is hard.
---
Vanilla is hard. People are going to be ragequitting just because they pull too many mobs questing and have to do their 4th 2 minute long corpse run. People have no idea what they're getting in to.
---
6 man dungeon?  Hmm
---
It was most definitely FRAPS. VoIP was Ventrillo.
---
This is why I'm leveling a separate farming alt. I want to avoid respecs. I spent way too much on that back in the day.
---
I was speaking from the side of one faction
---
People are jokingly talking about either losing to everything or 1 shotting with WF, but i dont think theres any spec where the memes hold more true.
---
youre gonna lose like 2/3 fights but win 1/3 on great procs. On the whole youre at a disadvantage against most classes, but you always have a chance to win.
---
My biggest and main problem with Enh Shaman is that theres 0 itemization for this spec, less than Ele, SPriest, Ret, Prot Pala, Oomkin and Feral by a long shot. The best pieces you can get are occasional Rogue/Feral Druid and Hunter pieces. Like for every Feral piece there is, theres probably 1/3 that are actually good for an Enh Shaman, and for every offset Hunter/Mail piece that exists, like 1/3 and all those pieces are few and far between to begin with. Youll struggle to get a decent set of blue gear at 60, let alone epic.
---
Enh in raid is a meme spec. The only guilds you get thatll take you will be MC guilds that arent going anywhere fast.
---
I agree! But you will have to suffer through some sharding for levels 1-10, then.
---
But honestly, that's just like the first 3 hours of your 150 hour journey to 60.
---
what events are you speaking of
---
Aren't we getting crossrealm bg queues?
---
This is a dilemma we all face everyday until the release of Classic haha.  I personally have held off until I created a Shaman, leveled him to about 7 and then logged off and haven't been on since.  I just can't get invested.
---
WTB gf...
---
...
---
=(
---
The way I've heard it described, and it seems accurate...
---
Vanilla WoW is not hard, but it's unforgiving. When you make a mistake, you will die.
---
Locks are one of the best (and IMO the most fun) classes to play while leveling. Hunters and rogues are the only classes that may give you trouble. Once siphon life and death coil come online you're a lot harder to kill. I never felt like weak while leveling my lock. 
---
I want to be undead hunter 😭😭😢
---
Old add on was mobinfo2 from memory that would estimate enemy hp and other buffs based what happened when in range of your combat log
---
Oh damn, I got got. 
---
Who's going to have 500g? Mobs drop copper.
---
I’m going to be straight with you, you just straight up can’t bring very many tank/dps Paladin’s to raids, BUT, that being said, there’s almost certainly going to be FAR fewer of the Paladin type you’d like to play, than there will be of most “needed” things.
---
I’ve been doing my “research” for months now, and honestly man, people really blow this optimization thing out of the water. Every single class and spec has its uses in this game, and there are going to be so many guilds not going to optimizations that might take several more of these non optimal classes. If the guild isn’t pushing a new raid, you’ll find a raid.
---
Play what you are interested in, there’s so many people trying to deter people from playing optimal class/specs which only contributes to the “problem.”
---
Good luck man and have a good time! I hope this was some form of help for you!
---
Not necessarily. For example, I loved the arcane mage in TBC. It was a fun spec to play., but I do t have the freedom to play that spec in vanilla wow. That’s why I like TBC talent points and would love them in wow classic. It’s like vanilla but upgraded a bit. So French vanilla basically. Now I want ice cream. 
---
Actual unpopular opinion: The modern retail character models would detract from Vanilla and don't belong.
---
The argument of "it's just client side, it doesn't matter" could be applied to anything. Why not have a toggle to make your character a Panderan? Or have Thunderfury? But just clientside? Same reasons.
---
Another issue is that many people very deliberately choose what they look like, RPers and other players alike.
---
If you choose your face based off the retail WoW models, or the original Vanilla models, your face may look significantly different based on the version.
---
Imagine you go out of your way to get a Corrupted Ashbringer or you're an RPer and you wear slutty gear, etc, but on someone else's client it doesn't show up.
---
Part of the reason we choose the way we look is so other people can see it. It's not just about looking at yourself in the mirror.
---
Having Retail WoW models instead of Vanilla WoW models, even as a toggle, would detract from that and is not appropriate nor needed for Vanilla WoW.
---
If the "old" models from Vanilla WoW really bother you that much, you're in for a nasty surprise when you see the rest of the world.
---
Should they update the Troggs too? All the mobs? Spiders? What about the trees? Should they use the Cataclysm revamp models for all the doodads?
---
The exact same argument applies to all of those objects. Why not make those a toggle? Just client side so it's ok, right?
---
It is absolutely inappropriate. The devs at Blizzcon already detailed how they replaced all the Retail WoW models with the *original art assets.*
---
Why would they undo their work?
---
&gt;doesn't know how to turn the camera around to face their character's front
---
Noob!
---
Patience is at an all time low in general, let alone in gaming.
---
They're functionally identical for these purposes.
---
Do they not already shown up as nodes in Legion? I thought they did
---
Points to 30 points on the back.
---
If they do, then they probably will in Classic.
---
The thing is (iirc) they only show up as nodes when you actually have the quest. So I've no idea if it worked in Legion or not.
---
It might not be hard but the majority of it is more difficult then current. I'm goofing off with my wife on retail with sub level 20 toons and the games already randomly upgrading my gear too epic. Its stupidly easy to face roll all the leveling content
---
WTS gf, 50g/month, PST.
---
Awesome, thanks.
---
Freezing Band. I was level 51 and had enough money for my epic mount lol.
---
Wrath was the beginning of the end. Even Asmongold, the man who has never quit says this.
---
TBC already made some mistakes(flying..) but they weren't fatal until Wrath.
---
For pre-40 stuff no classes really have a gargantuan farming advantage like they do later. I’m a total scrub and I got the gold for mount by 40 as warrior (on pservers this year) just by spending very little and looting all mobs. Didn’t even use gathering profs.
---
I'm going to lay it down for you straight , from one high-end pvper to another.
---
Enh is good for meme'ing in pvp, it has severe flaws in terms of lacking a proper gap closer and all of your shocks have a 20 yard range , so if u want to snare or interrupt a cast you need to be close enough to do that.
---
You're obviously prone to being kited heavily as such classes that can snare and keep a distance or cc you before you connect will give you a hard time, not to mention classes that have some form of melee counter-measure or avoidance ( think evasion/retaliation etc) will also give you a hard time, even if you abuse free action potions, reflectors and rocket boots, if you add the fact that your burst relies purely on the RNG-gods , even if you manage to connect to a target you might not do much damage if WF doesn't proc, enh works better in 1v1 wpvp scenarios, in bgs you cannot avoid getting kited or focused and your life becomes much harder.
---
 In general though ,hunters should give you the hardest time. I'm obviously talking about if you're against good players coz if they're trash you can beat anything 1v1, but in general most match ups are RNG , i'd say it's 50/50 but WF procs or lackthereof can swing fights significantly even if you play perfectly.
---
Some fights like priest and lock are in your favor but good players can beat you if you fail to get within shock range or to anticipate fears/CC, if you tremor too soon they'll just wand it before it pulses, but generally once you connect to them they should die , some expection for good SL locks with T2 bonus making it impossible to purge soul link off pet.
---
In terms of specs enh is too rng , resto is mana inefficient and is easily tunneled, that's why elemental/resto (30/0/21) is the defacto shaman pvp build for any form pvp , whether it be wpvp/premade bgs etc.
---
Do note that early on elemental gear is scarce so if you decide to go elemental you'll have to gather scraps and you probably wont have enough spell damage/crit to 2 shot people,if you decide to go the pve route for gearing you won't be able to get any proper ele gear until around ZG/BWL and optimal gear at AQ40.
---
Pvp gearing route early on is meh for shaman unless they decide to release pvp gear fully updated ( which isn't likely), I'd say R13 gear is good after the update , better than T2 on some pieces but doesn't compare to AQ 40 gear for ele.
---
I miss it every day! My Guild was awesome... we grinded dungeons every day to get people to pre-BiS for MC. Shut down the same weekend as we were going into MC...
---
I’m still friends with some of those guys to this day, after almost four years(?) and I’m anxious to see if similar communities form in Classic. I’m certain!
---
Would love a link too - if only to take the edge of the wait. Thank you!
---
My wifes joining me again. She started in bc and didn't hit endgame till wotlk and she raided progression with me. She preferred the social guild over the hardcore raid guild so she burnt out fast. Were coming back and playing diffrent roles then normal. She's going dps instead of heals and I'm going dps instead of prot warrior. We just want too grind that level 60 and enjoy ourselves farming 5 mans for gear with friends. 
---
Gosh I wish this game was this stylized. This is tremendous.
---
 Well done!
---
It's a 40 conscious people check. Unfortunately we usually only had 20 or so.
---
&gt; You can't talk to npcs while mounted, and you won't auto dismount to talk or cast a spell. You have to click dismount and then do the action.
---
That's only for NPCs like the Flight Masters that would need you to dismount. You don't need to dismount to talk to NPCs.
---
&gt;   I chose paladin because i read that they are pretty much the easiest healing class 
---
Misconception. They have very little versatility which makes them rather difficult to play in 5/10 mans. With only direct heals you can only keep people up in your group one at a time, without careful time and being able to predict damage, youll end up with a dead people very often. The other healing classes have better tools to heal multiple targets which makes healing dungeons much easier. While raid healing is easier, raid healing is largely homogenous, every class just spams 1 type of direct heal 90% of the time. Paladin is easier because you time 1.5s instead of 2s as a Priest or Druid, so its easier to get more effective heals, but I found getting the 2s timing down isnt a very difficult leap. In short, 5man healing is a bit complex and is hardest for Paladins, while raid healing is very simple and is easiest for Paladins. You decide whats "easier".
---
&gt; What can i farm on paladin? 
---
DME farming and AoE farming is doable in PvE Holy spec, slower than mage, but its all right. In terms of 1v1 against mobs, decent, slow, but better than Druid or Priest Id say. Paladins have fairly flexible specs. You only "need" 20 points in Holy. If you really want to AoE farm hard you can even spec into Holy Shield if you really wanted to. 
---
&gt; Is there a build that can do both solo content like quests or farming that can also heal decently, or do i need to respec often? 
---
Again, 20 points is the number you need in Holy (some people might insist on 21, but its not that necessary). Depends if you want to be Hybrid Ret, Holy Reckoning or AoE farm Holy/Holy Shield.
---
&gt; Can i heal dungeons while leveling with retri? 
---
Same as every other hybrid class.
---
&gt;  Are there good PvP builds? (I hear about the Shockadin) 
---
Shockadin isnt a meme spec per se, but dont expect any sort of amazing DPS from it. Its just a full PvE Holy spec that tries to make Holy Shock hit as hard as possible in PvP. Holy Shock, even in full T2 (PvP gear, not talking about max SP gear), is going to crit for for about 800-1000 from what I remember back then, despite people boasting bigger numbers. Thats a guaranteed crit every 2 mins and a normal hit of about 400-450 every 30s. Nothing groundbreaking, but if youre full Holy spec its all you got. Youll still win most 1v1s as you can outlast most classes as a Paladin.
---
Paladins have numerous PvP builds, some of which ive already mentioned, lots of discussions about them out there already to look up.
---
My wifes also a lifetime clicker, it's why she doesn't pvp at all. She's always managed in raids unless she freaks out at bad stuff. Some modern raid mechanics overwhelm her so I'm hoping going back to classic will keep her content
---
The change to deathcoil is probably the single biggest thing that changed people's perspective on Warlocks. It made winning a duel go from possible to easy.
---
Warlocks really have a lot of diversity based on their talent trees. Without the Destruction tree, you have no burst ability. Demonology can buff your survivability from "less squishy than a mage" to about as tough as they come. Affliction makes you mobile and gives you the ability to outlast even a Paladin.
---
If you're deep in Destruction, you could gank people. If not, a lot of people will be able to get away if they're not interested in trying to fight you.
---
Locks never really sucked, they're just one of the harder classes to play. Fear is powerful, but in PvE it's much harder to utilize than simply sapping someone or sheeping something.
---
Rogues are considered bottom tier for leveling due to a few things: no self heals, lowest armor values in the game, no significant ranged attacks. Remember, all cloth classes have spell buffs that increase armor values, and druids get bear form. Rogues are the only class that is leather armor, and nothing else added.
---
Yes, they have an advantage over warriors with evasion, sprint and vanish, but warriors can also throw on a shield, hit recklessness, retaliation or intimidating shout. Warriors also have some of the highest armor values in the game.
---
Ya I like this too. I mostly like the idea of wow classic being organic and receiving updates that are needed to the game. I don’t want a “no changes” attitude that holds the game back from being truly incredible. 
---
Skullflame shield i think it was. Dropped from a hippogryph in the hinterlands. Didn't have the heart to sell it, wore it on my shaman for a while
---
weapon damage is super important for levelling though
---
Toggle doesn't even work right on retail for the old models. Even if you did get the model/animation toggle, you'd have a handful of updated models and then every single piece of gear and every other NPC looking like absolute garbage. There's no point in having updated models with your character's face would have more pixels than its entire armor set+weapon.
---
Get rid of the combining of the realms for instances and AH. 
---
Make realms matter!
---
Doesn’t he drop the tank prebis trinket? I don’t know if they changed it but it’s possible you’re remembering runs for that trinket
---
There is a huge problem with the idea of post naxx content that isn't BC. And that is the need for a whole new design team to build that content. the team working to restore vanilla has the exact skills needed to continue restoring the expansions rather then the skill set/man power for making brand new content. Classic will need to be a incredibly massive success for blizzard to commit to having to wow design teams working on both current game and classic. And then u start to get into needing a second set of testers/a new test ream etc. I totally agree that it would be awesome for it to happen but i don't see how it is at all possible.
---
That's the thing. I don't think it will be only for 1-10. And I hope I am wrong, but my gut tells me they will use the sharding well pass the 1-10 zones.
---
&gt;They already have the assets.
---
What assets? The toggle has never worked on retail so it's pretty unlikely they're going to magically fix it just for classic.
---
But.. It isn't maladath, it's nightmare blade ;) I get what you're saying though :D
---
I got laughed at by the hardcore crowd for playing survival hunter but most people didn't care. I like underpowered classes and specs and seeing how well I can do. I'll be memespec this time around too
---
Conflag fireballs actually add difficulty though. It’s still very doable with 20 undergeared people with good mechanics, with or without the confuse. Making it easier doesn’t solve this.
---

\-You should beat druids most of the time cause you can heal and they can't (purge/shock).
---
\-Rogues beat you if they're good and you're not orc.
---
\-reckoning palas beat you if they get just 1 heal off.
---
The best guilds in the world literally wiped on him nightly for months on end. It was impossible.
---
I like the Dark Souls comparison. Watch new people play it and you think its the hardest game ever. Watch a seasoned vet beat the game practiclly naked without getting hit and you get the gist. Hell you can go as far as comparing it to Super Mario Bros. Many peole cant get far at all in that game (and its literally just a run and jump game), yet there are those who make it look like a fuxing joke.
---
Vanilla is a lot like these games. Less tools to use, bit fewer mechanics to counter. Many would would use the word "pure" to describe this kind of situation, and as a bunch of jack off vidya gamers we all know purity is fucking time consuming and takes discipline.
---
Have you tried countdown to classic? It’s some of the best content out there imo.
---
I honestly don't think the opinions of private server players really matter when it comes to defining classic as easy. Private server players generally have a ton of experience with vanilla or at least tbc. MUCH more than half of the people that will play classic probably haven't experienced vanilla or possibly haven't even played this game or any mmo's since vanilla.
---
Just because a guide exists everywhere doesn't mean it'll be easy.
---
This is actually how I impressed the leader of a guild I ended up joining. Healed LBRS as Feral spec and blew his fucking mind.
---
I've actually had that happen on nost when it first launched, except it was the healer that gy rezzed after trying to find the place for 8 minutes and told us to come get her when we were already at the goblin area.
---
I don't remember sneed being in Dire Maul. What wing was that?

All the polls show that the majority of players want toggles to enable the nicer Retail WoW models and not have to use the ugly classic models. 
---
Granted, most of the respondents to those polls are retail players who vastly outnumber those who actually ever played Vanilla, but that doesn't matter. The community is the community.
---
In [this article,](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hnewman/2018/01/30/classic-servers-cats-and-cute-things-the-world-of-warcraft-interview/#22d93d875134) J Allen Brack said "Should we be using the high definition character models? That’s an interesting question, I think, that the community will help us decide."
---
The answer is clear. The community doesn't want the ugly classic models. They want the newer updated Retail WoW art assets.
---
My girl is practising right now. Her first MMO ever. Level 18 Priest and I think she started previous friday with 1-2 hours/day.
---
We managed to do RFC with no wipes and today we will enter WC! 
---
I think the main reason I bought her a laptop and made her play is to somewhat understand my hype and also not feel left out. She always let me play but I want her to also be like: "Wanna play after work?"
---
You need to improve your kill per hour (KPH)
---
The way you play this spec is by pulling the next mob as your current one drops low, and then when you just finished dotting your new target you drain soul the previous mob, it dies and then you wand the next target.
---
Once you learn to time this properly and are farming the right kinds of mobs (often raptors before level 40), youll easily pull ~130 KPH. Its so efficient its rivaling pure questing for me, 27-32 I farmed because a level by questing was ~2 hrs 15 min and a pure grinding level was ~1 hr 45 min.
---
I also dont recommend getting shadow damage gear, its not worth the cash especially early in the release, focus on spirit and intellect, to regen more mana and be able to spend more mana per mob. (Stamina is also a decent stat, because youll often be in pvp zones, making it easier to survive a gank means youll spend less time recovering and more time killing!)
---
Don't play on patch day.
---
Let's do some simple math, if you're revered with 0 points you need 21000 rep to exhalted, every stack rune cloth gives you 50 rep (if you're not human), so 21000/50= 420 stacks.
---
If the average price for runecloth on your server is somewhere between 1-2g  , it'll be somewhere between 420- 840g to get you to exhalted, in the latter case that's about the price of the mount itself.
---
It's also worth noting that you're unable to purchase other race's mounts unless you are exhalted with their faction , so if you're ever considering getting one of those cool tiger/raptor mounts now you know how much gold you'll really need \^\^ .
---
Thanks for the concise answer....it honestly seems like shaman isn't the route for me at this point. I definitely need to brand into something else then 
---
I had a Krol Blade drop in EPL. I was grinding random mobs before 60 (those huge disgusting worms IIRC), I went to loot without thinking about it and my heart stopped for a second when I saw the purple color, and then even more when I saw what it was. I basically pictured my future epic mount in the same way Tom pictures Jerry as meat in the cartoons. I even remember going to my friend's house afterwards and telling him and he was so pissed at how lucky I was.
---
Im just gonna hop into this argument to answer your question, early on, yes the 5% crit makes the biggest difference actually, thats 5% less mana youre using basically and while mana efficiency is Paladins fortee, its still difficult to max rank FoL in just preraid gear.
---
Eventually when you start having no problems with mana, the regen becomes less and less of a problem. In your specific scenario of just MC/Ony gear, while you as the Paladin arent getting tons of new gear, your guild will be, fights will get shorter from better DPS and tanks will take less damage, requiring less regen.
---
Lastly, back to the heart of the argument, as someone that mained Paladin in vanilla retail, and on and off on pservers the last 8 years, crit, while a strong stat, is seriously overrated amongst the Paladin community. Yes, it gives regen, but thats only really important early on when you have bad gear and need extra regen. Every Paladin running AQ and Naxx will tell you they never bother with Distilled Wisdom because they never get that low on mana (unless they LoH for the armor buff, but extra mana wouldnt help in that situation).
---
Next, %crit gives you +heals sure, but you cant equate +1% crit = about 1% healing. Its more like 1% crit gives you about 0.1% effective healing and 0.9% overhealing. The problem is that crits are unpredictable, and more often than not those crits are wasted on overhealing in raids, which is why i try profess to people that when you get to that near infinite mana point, you should start prioritizing +healing more heavily for better consistency rather than random burst overhealing.
---
Concluding, you get to a position where +crit is giving you excessive regen you dont need and marginal +effective healing and lots of overhealing. While its certainly better to have than nothing, 5% will not see you get whopping differences on the meters. And yes, Paladin is a class with flex points, because no, Holy Power is not an absolute necessity, though it is the best possible +healing talent you can get once youre 21 points Holy.
---
I hope that you are wrong, too!
---
I suspect they will start it at 1-10 on launch day and, if they expand it to 11-20, would do so only after those zones get overloaded.
---
So is the proper strategy to play all day on launch, get ahead of the curve and past level 20 before Blizzard can expand sharding?
---
same! off winterspring owlbeast over 10 years ago. I was almost 60, helped get my epic mount quickly.
---
i made  a deal that if i did this thing she wanted a year back she would play vanilla with me no questions asked. she died later that year  
---
only jking she only wishes she died, i remind her monthly about the agreement. i can not wait but if she hates it after level 20 i will just say fine you dont have to play 
---
He gave her some hard wood ;)
---
&gt; All the polls show that the majority of players want toggles to enable the nicer Retail WoW models and not have to use the ugly classic models.
---
What polls? I've yet to see one of those polls and the overwhelming majority of people I've seen talk about model toggle are either against or indifferent, not for the toggle. Just look at the upvotes (or rather downvotes) on your OP. If that doesn't speak for the majority then IDK what does.
---
&gt; The answer is clear. The community doesn't want the ugly classic models. They want the newer updated Retail WoW art assets.

Now you're just pulling this shit out of your ass. At least be less obvious the next time you try your hand at trolling.

I was until I realized  it doesn;t include Halo 3 and then I just didn;t care really. People don't remember how bad reach was, they just remember it being better than the piss poor post releases 
---
I’m still playing everquest, I’m going to let WoW steal my eq subs for the second time.
---
Im actually amazed it only sold for that, I remember garbage like Brain Hacker sold for about 200g back then. I cant believe 2 Brain Hackers could be equivalent to an actual decent weapon lol
---
Ahhh mate I'd love a copy too when you're done. Lets compare notes classic notes :)
---
Woah Okay. Thank you kindly for the thorough reply. 
---
It does include Halo 3! They're just releasing each game a few months after each other I believe. 
---
Reach was a fantastic game after they fixed the DMR bloom issues in my opinion 
---
Your "first" guild poster? Since when are they even a thing lol
---
It still doesnt make sense to me why that could possibly take 6 fucking hours to restart servers.
---
Slippery slope is only a fallacy if you can't explain/prove the causation between point A and B.
---
Why is incentivizing PvP in the open world, Horde vs Alliance, a bad thing?
---
I am just saying that honor gains could be raised in order to give players more of an option than just farming bgs all day.
---
The main reason players do BGs is for the honor rewards. I am not saying making honor farming in World PvP just as viable, but at least make it possible. 
---
What about the top comments on [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b0yo3l/modelsanimations_toggle_option_ever_been/) thread? This is current, I can dig up much more threads from the passed with huge sub involvement with the clear majority in support for modern Retail WoW models over the classic art assets with a toggle.
---
It is a PvP server.
---
This makes it even more nostalgic.  I remember taking WoW breaks all the time to play Halo.  It’s good to have balance. 
---
Why stop there? They should add the modern models for mobs like Troggs and Kobolds.
---
Why keep the classic models / animations when they can just add a toggle to have the modern Retail WoW models?
---
It's only client side after all.
---
that's a fact, tbc was vanilla with all the specs being viable
---
I had Buru's Skull Fragment forever. Kept waiting for my Car Door to drop of Chromasgnus but never got it. 
---
Hmmm, its sort of ironic because it was easy compared to games at the time.  
---
40 man content can be easier in the sense that content had to be designed so that it could be completed even if there was a single tard (maybe even more) in the raid and you could still squeek out a win.  
---
20 man stuff is much less forgiving.  
---
5 mans, very unlikely you can beat a vanilla boss with a single tard in the group.
---
Not gonna lie, you had me in the first half.
---
Lol
---
&gt;The community doesn't want the ugly classic models. They want the newer updated Retail WoW art assets.
---
No, they don't. They want classic to be classic. 
---
Keep in mind that a lot of people who are in favor of a graphics toggle don't necessarily prefer updated graphics, they just aren't threatened by or opposed to an actual toggle and player choice in this regard. I've encountered a lot of people who didn't have an opinion or thought it was a good idea but were insistent they prefer the vanilla art style.
---
To say "the community doesn't want the classic models" is disingenuous. It's more like "the majority simply aren't *opposed* to a functioning toggle."
---
Wasn’t the only discount from vendors 10% at Honored in Vanilla? The progressive discount from Friendly to Exalted came in TBC.
---
Becoming a Lawyer or Doctor is easy it's just time consuming.
---
Mastering the art of painting is easy it just takes a long time.
---
Driving a race car professionally is easy just gotta spend a lot of time doing it.
---
Then why not have a toggle to update the other models too? For all the same reasons. There are many people that simply prefer the modern Retail WoW models for Troggs, Kobolds, etc.
---
Since it's just client side so it doesn't matter, they should just add that to the toggle.
---
I put on my robe and wizard hat.
---
Easy. Skyrim remastered. Then the ME trilogy because I'm never letting it go 
---
Yes, but MC is also far easier than BWL. But even then, MC pugs can be a nightmare since people don't know how to manage their threat (which is significantly more sensitive in vanilla than TBC). Getting 8 aqual quintessence for pugs is a fucking nightmare.
---
But if its a semi-pug where the "core" of the raid knows what its doing, then its possible. But a full pug I would never join.
---
BWL is straight out unpuggable imo, because it requires more synergy and communication, especally when it comes to things like even first boss and suppression room. Chromaggus will be ultra aids for a pug, and Nefarian requires everyone to hvae the cloak etc.
---
ZG and AQ20 are the mots puggable, MC is possible. But I wouldn't pug much more beyond that. 
---
1 thread with a handful of comments saying they'd like a toggle. What a massive sample size. 
---
&gt; I can dig up much more threads from the passed with huge sub involvement with the clear majority in support for modern Retail WoW models over the classic art assets with a toggle.
---
Sure. After a cursory search, I did find a handful of threads! Most posters were against new graphics, some were ok with a toggle but wouldn't want it to delay the game and some wouldn't mind it in any way. The only thread with overwhelming support was one that was *only mentioning overall graphics* and 0 mentions of character models/animations after the community saw how graphics were in the Demo at Blizzcon.
---
Please enlighten me as to how you're speaking for the overwhelming majority of the subreddit while your post has 7 times more downvotes than upvotes. Please do.
---
I'm completely in favor of some kind of working toggle or optional patch to update models and textures.
---
Lifestone. I was so excited and then I wasnt.
---
Early in classic they were bad ass, thats why fear was nerfed at least twice and the so was death coil.  
---
Could snare kite one, fear kite another, and mezz a third with a succubus.  
---
AFK
---
You really need Soul Link to be strong in 1v1, but soul link is a much slower levelling/dps spec so not many people do that. And if you are Soul Link people will often just run away from you so it can be hard to gank or get kills still.  
---
  
---
You have the same problems at lvl 60. Soul Link is a good dueling spec but has weak dps so it can be hard to apply pressure in bgs where their will be dispellers. You can go affliction to put out more pressure but then you're a magnet for warriors/rogues/hunters.  
---
A lot of the reason they suck is from a PvE pov, where from a math perspective they are basically mages but don't get a free +6 hit. It hurts a lot, because hit is the most important stat for dps, and it can be hard to find on early lvl 60 gear.
---
That's my memory as well, but I'm not totally confident in that.
---
It'll be here soon, and probably sooner than we think depending on how demos/beta-tests roll out to us.
---
&gt;0 mentions of character models/animations after the community saw how graphics were in the Demo at Blizzcon.
---
You don't think a majority of the "community" wants a toggle for modern retail WoW models/animations for characters? (the community which is mostly made up of retail players by numbers)
---
My desktop is dead, so I can't play at all until I replace it. I also can't post on the official forum because I haven't logged in in so long that my character list won't refresh, even with customer service manually refreshing it so I can't even join in some discussions I would really love to dive into.
---
Sucks. Eager to play.
---
The spirit of classic is still there, as long as they dont change anything gameplay wise I don’t see why things looking prettier is that big of a deal breaker.
---
That’s how I remember it, but you also got 10% for pvp rep at some point.  Then they added the ram in AV.  
---
I think that the old graphics are an important part of reminding the player that classic is different from regular wow. But maybe after 100 hours I will get bored of the old graphics and want something prettier.
---
Stockade pauldrons dropped in silithus. Sold em for 500 gold
---
&gt;it's most certainly faster than warrior, paladin, priest, and shaman at nearly every point in the process provided you have decent weapons.
---
But all classes improve by farming for strong gear. If you have good weapons from 1-60, it will be a lot easier. But as a fresh I would assume you would first get your good weapons from deadmines or Wailing caverns, and then maybe in BFD/Gnomeregan (which are usually not farmed as much by players). But generally I would say you just spam-farm WC/DM keep those lvl 20-ish weapons until like lvl 40 when you get the SM/RFD combo from quests.
---
I lvled both warrior and rogue, and I found rogue to be much more of a pain in the ass up to a certain point. They are much squishier, stealth is not as good until you have distract, and not as strong unless you are doing lower-lvl quests (green quests, which is more efficient but generally requires a planned out guide).
---
I lvled both in their "intended" lvling areas (yellow quest zones) and found warrior to be quite a lot stronger. All you need is a gun/bow + arrow/bullets and pull efficiently, and not be a fool. Which is also the case for rogues of a lot of the time, but not managing to get good stealth openers is a huge detriment. 
---
I'd be like "hey, face is up here" 
---
So... What's wrong with being able to trade loot to someone else that was in the dungeon, while you're both still in the dungeon?
---
Because it is not suppose to be a war. The factions have a ceasefire. In fact, world pvp should be considered dishonorable because you are breaking Thrall's/Jaina's(Bolvar's) word. Because people want to be able to actually play and level. It isn't the random gank or fight they don't want. It is the complete and utter stand still that can happen like SS vs TM and STV-nam.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_2.3.0
---
&gt; Vendor Discounts: All vendors with an associate faction now give discounts at all levels above neutral.
---
&gt; - Friendly: 5% discount
---
&gt; - Honored: 10% discount
---
&gt; - Revered: 15% discount
---
&gt; - Exalted: 20% discount
---
Could be 100% wrong, but IIRC there's a 10% boost to selling to a vendor when you're honored, 10% reduction to buying from a vendor at revered, no benefit from exalted (outside vendors with exalted required loot/patterns).
---
Also, wasnt there some pvp rank (10?) that gave you an additional 10% reduction. Again, just based on my incomplete 12 year ago memory.
---
So it needs to be ruined to the point that there would be zones where PvE would be totally impossible? Every quest zones that are important (class quest spots, good item reward q's etc) would be camped 24/7. 
---
You don’t speak for me. This topic has been discussed again and again on here.

I know rite? They should just add all the post Cata models and assets, including the doodads like trees and bushes, etc. Textures for the ground, all the new models for the mobs, etc.

I don't see why it's a deal breaker to have an option to toggle away the classic art. No one really wants to look at that old stuff anyway.
---
Everyone runs faster with a knife!

That's fair. I don't mind a toggle (though I certainly wouldn't use it). I just get pissed when someone like OP makes generalizing statements about the community as a whole like this:

it encourages you to roll on everything and then trade it to the highest price or just give it to your friends
---
lets just not have it please

you screw up with loot well bad luck you better be more careful in the future or you may get a bad rep

I don't mind a toggle to turn on the modern models.
---
I also don't mind if it ends up not being a thing. There's a case against them since armour and weapons with 2004-2006 graphics on WoD models don't really mesh too well. It ages the game more. 
---
The thing is - I don't mind if it was a toggle with THE OLD MODELS ON BY DEFAULT.
---
This goes for everything. Classic vanilla graphics should be on be default with modern graphics set as an optional toggle in the settings. Vanilla. Is. Default. In. Vanilla. It's that simple. 
---
That's for 2.3 though, so I'm not sure that's relevant.
---
I think the you only need rank 3 for the pvp discount.
---
Literally the point of this discussion.
---
Leveled to 30 on nost, made a friend at level 3, kept chatting non stop and 99% of the people i met were super friendly. I dont know what it is with Vanilla, but it makes people genuinely friendly.
---
The difference between retail and vanilla (classic) communties will be night n day, there is no comparison between the two. Even when i play group content, it feels lonely in retail.
---
Exactly. The reality is no one wants the classic art. Actually most people will find that the game is too boring / inconvenient too, they'll change that eventually hopefully.
---
But there is no reason they shouldn't add the ability to toggle modern Retail WoW models and animations for every mob, the new and better terrain textures etc from Cataclysm, and so on.
---
he one shotted him you goober, would him one shotting a hunter have changed your skill assessment somehow? 
---
There's nothing "wrong" with it, as concept inside a vacuum. But, it's a part of an overhauled loot and dungeon system that doesn't exist in classic. That's why it shouldn't happen.  It was born in a time with more available loot options, class specific need options (iirc). I've said it before and i'll say it again if they are absolutely stuck on including loot trading, they need to only apply it to master looting situations.

Is this guy serious?? Used to be a HUGE fan of Tips... Now I'm wondering.
---
I believe this is the Sepulcher.
---
Same. 10 pm my time usually.

In theory it would seem like server reputation matters. But in reality it doesn’t really. For every person who is aware of someone’s bad actions there will be countless others who don’t.
---
REMOVE POST !!!!

This subreddit isn't about him.
---
&gt;needing a 3-man posse to kill a midget
---
lol
---
The problem is that you don't know they traded the item.
---
Loot Trading is fine--so long as it's only enabled in Master Looter raids, and that it's **only** possible to trade loot with the Master Looter (i.e. you get an item, to give it to someone else, you need to give it back to the Master Looter who then gives it to that person, rather than you doing it without the raid being aware.)
---
This kills all\* loot cabals and simultaneously resolves the problem of excessive GM tickets. 
---
\* It does not solve a loot cabal that includes the Master Looter, in which case, you were fucked from the beginning.
---
Sounds like he had a reason ... and who fucking cares?
---
Good for you, most youtube classic wow hype bloggers are useless. 
---
&gt; The problem is that you don't know they traded the item.
---
&gt; 
---
What item are 4 people in a 5 man going to roll on that all of them want? You people act like it's some major deception when you'd have to not have eyeballs to not notice. You have a giant window before, during, or after rolling to inspect someone if you're that paranoid. 
---
This is the biggest nonissue this sub obsesses about. Why not campaign for spell batching instead? It was terrible for the game but it was authentic. 
---
Long time guild leader here with several top 100 world firsts.   We were semi hardcore workers who weren't super serious.  Required enchants and consumables but not maxed to the fullest and at least half BiS to start.
---
I would take some is the short answer.  I don't mind the lesser dps but what hurt me as a GM is watching them get upset they didn't get lost.  The tiers aren't optimized towards offspecs and weren't good for them so I just wouldn't let them roll.  After that, ret pallies for example are taking gear off of warriors who are the best dps in t1 and 2.
---
I think the best solution for this was only bringing those specs to farm content and bringing the best for progression.  It's hard to waste a slot on a ret when you can have a warrior or or rogue putting up 50% more damage. 
---
Finally... certain situations change the rules.  If we are short a healer that night we can run w 6 if we have a boomy that will innervate the priest.
---
Enh shaman for the warrior group.
---
Shadow priest for the locks etc...
---
I don't imagine for even a second that Blizzard intends to activate Loot Trading for dungeons. I am expecting this to be a raid problem.
---
Also as a mage player I would blow a lot of gold often to respec fire for ZG to break the monotony of frostbolt spam.   Fire is just resisted too damn much in MC, less in BWL but still a ton... then not at all really in AQ and Naxx!
---
You deserved it.
---
I have secret hopes that Blizz will eventually do improved classic server with rebalanced classes and added new content. No leveling post 60 or flying mounts though.
---
Uh, what if the one of the evil loot traders is the Master Looter? You’ve still got the same problem.
---
Guildy A is Master Looter and in a group with Guildy B and Guildy C. Item drops that Guildy C needs, and A, B, and C roll. Guildy B wins the roll. Master Looter gives the item to Guildy B, who trades it back to the Master Looter and the Master Looter trades it to Guildy C.
---
I really like this answer. Thanks for this.
---
15 year old edgelord coming through.
---
Youre trash
---
Your entire comment attempts to subvert my post by saying there's a single edge case scenario...
---
which I addressed in my comment...
---
&gt;* It does not solve a loot cabal that includes the Master Looter, in which case, you were fucked from the beginning.
---
I playing on classic pservers since 2011, so I'm more than ok with new models toggle switch. 
---
It's bring something fresh, but I'm also ok with old models. 
---
He banned you because you're a racist piece of trash.
---
Ah, that's a fair point, I hadn't thought of that.
---
The point of it seems to be to offer more control over which members get what and when, so making it master-loot only wouldn't seem to bother that.
---
I could not care less about pug raids. 
---
I stopped at you can't tell because the rest of your post isn't worth reading btw. Maybe don't lead with something that points to incompetence next time. 
---
1.12 already increased honor gain with 15%. You want more ?
---
Why is it that every time someone says they got banned for no reason it turns out there's actually a very good reason?
---
Ya, he is not very good imo.
---
Right-click report. It's2019 Classic Baby. :)
---
Making a sticky comment because there's some confusion about how reputation influences vendor buying/selling prices.
---
[From the Brady Games WoW Vanilla guide](https://imgur.com/a/3PGnvz6), the only discount is 10% off buying stuff when you reach Honored. There's another discount at PVP rank 3 (I think). Although the guide doesn't mention it, I *think* you also sell stuff for 10% more to Honored reputation vendors, but the guide doesn't specify that so I may be wrong.
---
Kill it, it's a gnome 
---
Paladin is almost certainly the best pockethealer, on top of the healing they have insane utility that helps the warrior alot
---

---
Definitely level feral, you'll be able to heal fine til maybe ST or so, when even non-hybrid classes like priest will need to be careful if they're not holy. 
---
People are reluctant to bring druids to heal for 5-mans because druids only have battle rez, not regular rez, which can cost a group a lot of time if the run doesn't go immaculately and if there's no pally or shaman in the party to rez.
---
I would always play wc3 customs on Tuesday mornings. When classic releases I'll be doing the same but on wc3 remastered.
---
So I came in here to make a lulz joke about removing your post because of super-secret Rule #8 (no bashing Tips), but really, your post is removed because this isn't relevant to Classic WoW and who knows why he blocked you... and even if anyone *did* know my god is that trivial. It's Twitter bruh.
---
But then I saw you made a comment *in this very post* seemingly supporting the shooting in New Zealand, justifying it as "it's almost as if people are tired of muslim violence..."
---
So with that, I look forward to your post on r/wowservers about how you were banned from r/classicwow ...For NO reason.
---
You have to keep dosing them in their smoldering state.  If you don't keep at least a few AoEs o. Then they will respawn.
---
Reminder? Come on, guys. This is the 321st post about loot trading. The developers don't inhabit fish tanks. 
---
I think it'll work, there are quite a few quests where it helps to be herbalism or miner.

There's only one Server. You just pick which shard to be on at login... 
---
It's actually not uncommon for classes to have multiple PvE specs. It's very common to have multiple PvP specs. It's just that some classes don't always get to play multiple roles.
---
* Druid: Feral and Resto are PvE viable. TL;DR is all three specs are PvP viable but Resto is the most popular.  
---
* Hunter: Marksman is default PvE. Sometimes Survival is played in PvE. All three trees are PvP viable.  
---
* Mage: Frost and Fire spells are PvE viable. All three talent trees are PvE viable, but Arcane lacks the equivalent of a bolt spell so Arcane is used to buff Frost DPS. All three specs are PvP viable, but again Arcane is used as a support spec.  
---
* Paladin: Paladins kind of get the short straw. They're almost always expected to heal in PvE but if you're lucky you might get to play other specs. Ret/Reckoning are great for small scale PvP like duels, world PvP etc though.
---
* Priest: All three trees see some use in PvE. Some guilds use a dedicated Shadow Priest, some guilds have one of the healers spec 5/5 Shadow Weaving. All three trees get used in PvP, but you're 100% expected to heal in organized PvP. Shadow is fine in small scale PvP.
---
* Rogue: Combat Swords in PvE. Every spec is viable in PvP.
---
* Shaman: Similar to Paladins, you're most often expected to heal in PvE. Ele/Resto is usually considered the most powerful PvP spec by a wide margin.
---
* Warlock: Regardless of spec Warlocks spam Shadow bolt in PvE. All three specs are viable in PvP.
---
* Warrior: Arms PvP, Fury and Prot PvE. Some people play Fury PvP but it's rare.
---
I remember questing through the Sepulcher on my original main. I started another Undead a couple of months ago (just to see how it compared to back in Vanilla) and it really isn’t the same. For one thing the world is just so dead, and they try to fill it using cross realm zoning. God I miss the glory days of WoW. Leveling my main (I only really played one toon) was some of the best video gaming I’ve ever done.
---
If they make it xp off against only xp off again it will shorten the amount of time I play the game. I was one of many that paid for a server xfer for one of my twinks in wotlk too keep playing an active bracket.  Its alot easier too make a twink with xp off and that alone kills it for alot of people. I know 75% of a 29 guild that's coming back for classic. 
---
It's not about farming levelers for most of us, it's about pvp without having to farm 40 man content too stay viable. 
---
"it's been an hour since we had this circle jerk" time.
---
I think it's a good idea, let's see how good and self-policing this community is as promised by the #nochangers.
---
God so many idiots downvoting posts like this is horrifying. Bravo brother.
---
"Guys i killed a resto!!! Look it was hard and impressive i promise!!!"
---
I'd bet a lot of money you're a lowby ganker that flees once you see someone actually your level.
---
And so many posts like this, WHICH DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE RAMIFICATIONS OF A GAME THEY DONT PLAY. 
---
Upvote my comment if u/ndrfx should be banned for this idea, downvote my comment if u/ndrfx should be spared.
---
/s (?)
---
I^actually^like^pet^battles^too
---
If you're going to one shot someone how does the class even matter bozo? If it was an ele shaman that got one shotted would that matter? 
---
I agree. This is something I think that would add to the game without taking anything away from it. Of course any experience gain or benefit would have to be removed.
---
Is it likely we will see it? Not a chance. But it'd be something nice to do will idling time in capital cities, before raids or maybe while waiting for that Hunter that didn't realize you can't summon with Meeting Stones.
---
&gt;Some people played Fury PvP after that one Swifty vid but it's rare
---
Saying things any real Vanilla fan would agree with gets you downvoted on this sub. Fuck this place. 
---
Haha Haha! You think someone would subject themselves to a relationship with me, that's a good joke.
---
I am not sure. I do not think Blizzard will be returning to their 2004 attitudes to griefing, scamming, incivility, racism etc. Whether they are going to class twinkers as griefers or not is an interesting question. To put it mildly, there is a strong argument that they are griefing.
---
Your original argument that one shotting had skill in it, when i told you it's due to gear not skill, there's no skill into hitting a single ability with absolutely zero strategy at all, stop trying to divert the subject.
---
No. In Classic, pets take up bag space.
---
I think it fits better in retail wow. More pets better systems etc.
---
Same! Found it in Hillsbrad near Alterac. Sold for 300g and my eyes almost popped out of my head
---
No it does include Halo 3. It includes all but Halo 5 so far, check the Steam page.
---
The #1 guild on my server had an enhancement shaman and a feral druid. They were doing naxx.
---
It's a meme talked about by private server babies who didn't actually play Vanilla and want to push their shitty mentality onto everyone else.
---
&gt; I'm used to early levelling in human zones (not really an issue I just feel like I'll be much slower when I don't know the zones)
---
You can just take the time to run across the world and level up in the human worlds. There are boats and tram etc 
---
No, I want my old female undead model. I DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE WANT THE NEW MODELS FOR THAT CHARACTER. The same would be said if this was BC-Classic. The new model royally fucked up how a lot of models looked. On top of that you will have muddy textured gear (this stuff was never updated) on top of these "shiny new" model that clash very badly. On top of that it could in theory provide an advantage to the people using the new models because how they contrast to the old world's texture. 
---
If this happened to me I would be down. Nothing sucks more than trying to get a group together on a low pop server, or trying to fill out ranks in your with nobody new coming in...
---
This is a good point. How many vanity pets are in vanilla? I know a lot of them were jist reskinned cats lol.
---
You have to keep in mind that most people that post on here, indeed most of the potential customers, are retail WoW players who have never touched Vanilla.
---
This video by Staysafe breaks it down perfectly. Literally every step of getting Vanilla WoW has been and will continue to be an uphill battle.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI5BpLMfSqg
---
And If this happens players will stop doing pugs. Only guild and friends would do 5mans. I would nerver team up with randoms If this system was in classic.
---
first game thats releasing on it will be Halo: Reach and then the rest in chronological order 
---
All valid points, but you're in the vast minority.
---
Explain.

---
The only thing i've never liked about wow are the racials. I wish you could pick any racial. Just so i could  play undead with any available class without getting denied from a raid spot because of some stupid community rules about what race goes with which class. Ya feel me?
---
There is actually quite a bunch i had a friend that was crazy about collecting and farming them in vanilla
---
Oh totally. The system would have to be isolated.
---
You need soul link if you're shit at the game and need to be carried by a braindead talent.
---
No. On private servers there are already issues with the pvp rankers of the faction with longer queue times being out in the world farming level 50s like they're just mobs.
---
This is actually bad for the pvp rankers as they can't even take a break between bgs, lest some other guy knocks them out of the bracket by killing a handful of lvl 50s more.
---
In Classic i played elemental and enhancement in pvp, and up to bwl in pve, for aq40 i played enhancement resto for dos groups, and for naxx i played resto.
---
I didnt recieve any hostility, i even got the guilds first sulfuras.
---
Undead look the best on plate. Can't wait to tank again.
---
They rock in pvp, stoneform is so strong. Pve they got no chance
---
I built a new PC just so I dont have too worry. I'll be damned if I'm lagging at any point. When I started playing I couldn't go into towns unless it was 1-4am server time or I lagged out. Built a PC in bc and a new one now. Never again will I lag like that !
---
&gt;32. You can't cast max rank buffs on low level players.
---
Also big thing is that you had to actually manually select correct rank from your spell book. Later they did change this so you will always cast "highest possible rank" spell to lower level players but it wasn't case in Vanilla.
---
Jesus fuck, are you actually serious?
---
Kind of a waste of time to suggest something like this. I honestly see class balance reworks even more likely to happen than pet battles. Let's focus on more important things :]
---
If anything, low ranked and lower level players should give less honor. Or you know, maybe just leave it how it was?
---
Seriously?!  
---
Reddit has a "save" feature, for crying out loud!
---
Well you don't really just get all flight paths. There is item now days in game that you can use with your alts that unlock some flight paths. Mostly 1-2 major ones from each zone.
---
Aggro is not too much of problem. There is modifiers in dungeons (affixes) that change every week. One of those affixes is skittish that causes tanks to do way less threat. Those weeks are only ones that tank might loose aggro, but playing with rogue (tricks of trade) or hunter (misdirect) does a good job.
---
“Evident majority”. Provide me proof of that, no, idiots from official forum doesn’t count.
---
Combat daggers can potentially compete with swords on single targets...but there are too many limitations/caveats on the spec whereas playing swords as a Human is foolproof. Also, gearing is easier for swords, especially before AQ. I really wish they never gave such powerful racials like this.
---
:( As a classic player up through WotLK...arena was the best thing that ever happened to wow for me. I loved it so much! I know this is a true unpopular opinion but I wish I could have classic just the way it is...with arenas lol. I dont even need gear from it. I just loved playing and ranking up. 
---
Yean, the million pet tab was far far away from classic.  Another thing would be the acctual pet battles were introduced in mop.non comb t pets didn't exist unti then. I am a pet battler, i collected "many pets" (tortolan voice) but i would be against mixing expansion features. 
---
We have no hit from talents.  We are very gear dependant to be considered strong damage dealer. 1v1 ownage, u need to be SL with T1-T2 mix. Fear and coil  is strong when leveling, not many can break it. Downside is that you have to farm 40+ shards before every raid. And it ofc has high skillcap
---
Can someone write out the quote that Ion made about this at Blizzcon?
---
On a normal population server it certainly does matter.   notorious baddies were always ignored by everybody who matters at lvl 60, e.a all major guilds  and yes they might still be able to trick some fresh new lvl 60s or lower levels, they still were sad lonely wretches, hanging out in IF / ORG all day with their shitty gear that mostly consisted of expensive BoE stuff and 5/20 man content  because they don't have access to the elite pve or pvp boP gear
---
Well its not the first or last time they have given  humans broken racials. EMFHS is a good example.

you don't sell stuff for more, but you get a discount buying stuff from vendors
---
&gt;The reality is no one wants the classic art.
---
Says who?
---
When did I say one shotting someone took skill? 
---
You're saying it does if it's a specific class because I'm assuming you have brain damage. I'm just pointing it out. 
---
Oh, I want the classic art. Showing modern graphics alongside classic graphics make classic graphics stand out more as dated. If it comes down to it we want classic graphics, with or without an option to choose updated models and other settings that do not give an unfair advantage.
---
Thinking outside the box right there!
---
Then they can keep playing retail and leave classic to us that wants True classic
---
No one knows. There is also couple important things:
---
* We are launching fresh servers. At the first items will cost a lot because there is way more demand than there is supply. Later on prices will drop as more people get those items and less people need them as much.
---
* Also there isn't any gold at game when it launches. All gold is generated from quests and selling items to vendor. This also heavily effects on prices. Gold has more value so what people are ready to pay now is way less than what it will be after months of actual launch.
---
* Economy is server dependent. Once again prices are mostly determined by supply and demand. It can be case that for herb (like Peacebloom) there is a lot of people farming it. It will increase supply and lower prices. But on another server thing might be different and only one guy farms them. Supply is low and demand is high so prices can be incredible higher compared to another server.
---
I never raided at all during vanilla completed some of my 5man dungeon set and got the epic shaman quest helm which is as far as i progressed in pve. Personally the most fun things i remember from vanilla was the random adventures i got into out in the world not "the content". Classic and the actual rpg elements that are still in the game is what i am most excited for it is a living world which facilitates my own adventures , which is what i most miss from current wow.
---
I dont understand why all there players Who nerver played vanilla wants to change the game into retail. 
---
And this was a problem that occured daily and took a lot of GM time until loot trading was implemented.  Everyone makes mistakes, and when there's A LOT of players playing, it stacks up.
---
Stop thinking people are perfect, Loot trading is something good. 
---
Of course they do, classic wow belongs in a museum. Period. If you recreate Mona Lisa you don't make her nose more straight or her hair more pretty.
---
Also, do remember the people Who actually wanted vanilla wow, the ones playing on private servers for year and petitioning for vanilla wow. Why would you change anything? Honestly.
---
People doesnt like change, or the unexpected, and preserving the game in a predictable and museum-like state would retain order.
---
Yeah, because this was such an issue when it was introduced. Everyone became a ninja.
---
I don't think anyone can recall one time someone stole loot through loot trading.
---
It did exist in vanilla, just that it took 3-4 days. Now it's automated and fast.
---
You turn in cloths only for Exalted rep grind ( if you are Tauren for example and want Wolf from Orgimmar ) or just xp. You get honored( max discount ) just by leveling.
---
That's a fair point if everyone on the server expects to not get a bad rep. People got kicked out of guilds for being a ninja looter, this isn't any different.
---
In all honesty, it's one of those things that would have no *huge* impact on Classic, but would at the very least probably increase the cost of pets for other players - imagine the prices of those Black Whelplings or the Disgusting Oozling if they were also useful in pet battles and not just for cosmetics! It'd change what people farm, too.
---
I mean, it's a minor change, but just like most ideas of changing Classic, it would have other ramifications that are a bit hard to measure until it's already implemented, at which point, it's too late.
---
I always preferred Ravencrest’s Legacy..
---
It created a community with rules and real reputation. You tried to be a good player or People renembered you. It was an important thing. Do be good and do right by others
---
Only question that matters: What will your friends play?
---
If none of your friends will play, you'll know when you start the game what character you want. Don't overthink it =)
---
My vanilla priest was constantly running DM instances (solo) for gold. For a priest, its much easier than lets say holy paladin. You can spam no cast time attack that heals you the same time. Ez.
---
I mean be less obvious when you are trolling
---
This is my only fear of going Horde now, Paladins. Damn those tin men. Just duelling them a bit in vanilla gave me headaches (Rogue). But we'll have shamans in our team this time, they were a beast to play against in BGs. Bam, 4000 dmg.
---
All I did was play WoW and Halo during my school days. Going to feel a lot nostalgic if I can switch between halo 2 and WoW again. Love it 😁
---
In the most hardcore guilds, the cookie cutter specs was a must. In our guild (after I quit they cleared atleast half naxx) we let everyone play what they wanted, as long as they did great in raids.
---
Only thing was that healers had to be healing spec and tanks had to be tank spec. DPS could do what they wanted as long as they did the DPS.

That's because dwarves are the best race period. 
---
Loot trading in raids with masterloot is fine. Not in 5 mans.
---
It can fix a small problem but It brings a newer bigger problem in return.
---
Actually met my wife in a guild during TBC. Yeah, I am one of those guys. Now we're married and have a kid  things have changed a lot obviously. Of course we're gonna play Classic together, but our focus won't be high end raiding because of huge time constraints. Looking forward to it anyway. Personally I also have the urge to support her as much as I can in the real world as well as in the game, bit this does not include class choice. I'll play whatever I want, which will be Warlock, she'll probably go with Shaman. Doesn't make sense to min/max duo class choice imho if you don't enjoy the class.
---
Well based on this post its not an unpopular opinion its split about 50/50.
---
Youve blown it out of proportion now, asking for a higher detailed alternative of any art asset is not the same as doing a model swap to thunderfury to quote your example. Doing a model swap would make getting those items lose its value you that's entirely different and not what im asking for here.
---
Yeah your totally right, people choose what they want to look like for others to see but mostly themselves, its the player who will see their character the most. Take orcs for example the face on the orcs looks 10x better on retail it shows so much more emotion and detail, rather than being a very blocky with dated textures.
---
It wouldnt detract from the vanilla experience at all i believe it would enhance it and draw more players in. Like others have said they have friends who want to try it but with the modern graphics options.
---
Myself and others are looking for the classic experience yeah maybe the graphics add a bit to that experience for some, not for me the experience is in the levelling, grinding  raids, community, dungeons etc its not at all defined by the graphics - personally ive been there and would love that toggle option.
---
On a side note it would be nice if they added the upright orc option in but i know that wont happen.
---
Unknown. It depends on how many tourists leave versus how many new players join.
---
That is impossible. I have never seen that. Price of bags will be dependent on price of cloth, and price of cloth will be dependent (among other things) on vendoring green tailor made items, this results in vendor bags (which are always fixed price) to always be more expensive. I have not seen an exception to this even during AQ war event, even so this should apply for most of classic anyway.
---
That being said, the more people there are on the server with same professions, less money is to be made from these conversions. 
---
You spelled gnome wrong.  ;)
---
To play Classic you must have a retail subscription.
---
So you can pet battle all you want there. Lucky you. :)
---
Or you wanted to play Night Elf and was aware of how the male casting animations looked.
---
Ah, they have the same attack speed? I didn't know. The looks I don't care to much for. I just like the Attack speed and DPS output. Do these mountain lions also do the same DPS?
---
I only juggle between sleep and wow.
---
A first person shooter dumbed down to be playable on console or one of the greatest games ever created... tough choice.
---
I'll probably be downvoted into oblivion, but I *REALLY* don't think loot trading will be that big of a problem come release. I'm sure there will be abuse cases, but I trust that the majority of the community is respectful to the needs of other players within a party. 
---
Pets, battles and toys in current WoW is great for collectors but the fact that there are so many of them ruins the uniqueness. You can't really have the classic design philosophy of loot being special together with the modern design philosophy of as much content as possible. Adding 100 new mounts to classic would be "unobtrusive" as well. It's only cosmetic overall. But everything you add to the game does affect it.
---
Teamspeak RC3 ?
---
Summon Shadow Priest ability was always one of the stronger Warrior abilities.
---
Yep, and mushroom kills everyone instantly, unless I rogue can manage to stun them for long enough, which is only 6 seconds.
---
I rather keep the old models. And I rather not have a toggle. Just so everyone keeps playing the same game. Didn't knew thus became an unpoppulair oppinion?
---
Sounds about right.
---
It's not a bad thing, but you're not incentivizing that, you're incentivizing honor farming.
---
You're right, and hopefully the rhetoric will die down with time. Sadly it's not enough to enjoy classic, one must loudly declare how aweful retail is and has been since
---
"we can hover on a forum daily about a video game trusting/hoping that we will spend 100's of hours of our precious time playing, but we cast doubt over blizzard being able to develop a graphics toggle because they were lazy about it in the past when it didn't matter to retail sheeps"
---
Or maybe this is just a case of motivated reasoning, like saying they could recreate vanilla wow close enough for #nochangers to want it, but yet simultaneously can't create a toggle......
---
I agree. Im not suggesting adding new pets, but your point still stands.
---
got that AH set
---
Yes and no. It was a passing thought. My fart turned into a shart.
---
That's not a solution. You have two problems: too many tickets about loot and people quitting over loot mistakes. If you're not addressing either of those problems and just putting your fingers in your ears while shrieking "no loot trading!!!!!!" then you are irrelevant to the discussion.
---
How long have you spent exploring retail? There's so many hidden interactables story details (like two skeletons holding hands being dragged into a tree stump in Drustvar by the roots) and scenery that BFA/Legion zones outclass basically all zones before them minus a few. I still plop along in RP on a hunter just exploring and doing achievements now and then. Not focused on endgame PvP or raiding just seeing the world made for me until classic is out.
---
Vanilla was amazing, but if we had a world where we had vanilla game play and quests with the visual detail and care of BFA, then WoW would be insanity levels of good. IMO of course. 
---
CS 1.6 time, or SC:BW. Many games were had, many noobs crushed under my zealot army.
---
If you are not having too much rush to max level then it's fine. Remember that every single class  can make journey from 1 to 60. Play what you feel like you will enjoy. Remember that leveling up alts is much more hard in Vanilla so picking right class to get maxed out is important. Rather play warrior and level up in 2 months and enjoy playing than level up hunter in 1 month and dislike every aspect of that class.
---
Unrealated to why it sucked but until you get properly geared you will be rogues favorite target. Thats in my opinion is quite demoralizing that you cant do jack shit in open world if pvp trinket is on cd and a rogue stunlocks you.
---
I think the person that quit because of a loot mistake is the one who made themselves irrelevant.  What an extreme and stupid reaction, honestly couldn't care.
---
There won't be any tickets for fixing loot, nor GMs answering them.  So that wouldn't be an issue either.
---
If you just want the actual battles, couldn't that be done through a UI mod? Without animations of course.
---
Came here to say this. Sure I will love to play Classic but pretty much nothing can recreate feeling what you had as kid when you rushed to home from school, decided to skip home work so you can jump in and get ready to be lost in Wailing Caverns with your friends.
---
vanilla isnt that complex
---
the difficulty is in the tediousness
---
a lot of guilds on private servers have feral druids or enhancement shaman nightfall bots
---
Know your audience. In r/classicwow, #nochanges isn't just a meme and people will violently oppose anything that wasn't in by 1.12. They reject the prospect of continuous development, and minds aren't changed here.
---
&gt; Rogues are scissors, warriors are rocks. 
---
I think dwarf rogues chew through warriors
---
I would agree that limiting it to master loot would be the best option, but loot trading WILL not cause any huge problems. It'll give the people who already ninja more room. But those players just as before will be shuuned away from the community.
---
RemindMe! 1 month 
---
Some are okay with these specs, the others are not. The general consensus is that these specs are fine for PvP and dungeons, but not for raids, exceptions exist though. 
---
There a lot more people willing to raid in special snowflake specs than guilds realistically willing to put them on raider roster. So for majority of unorthodox spec specs their PvE progress ends in 20mans and as MC PUG last slot fills (without any guarantee to be invited again).
---
This is Feenix-level of retarded gear
---
There is no reason not to, as said by someone who never did any software development.
---
Honestly for me orc is the best warrior because of stun resist and the axe bonus helps a lot. 
---
&gt;Didn't knew this became an unpoppulair oppinion?
---
It was from the beginning. When discussing anything about Classic WoW, you need to keep in mind that the vast majority of people involved in the conversation are form Retail WoW and have never played Vanilla.
---
This video from Staysafe has details https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI5BpLMfSqg&amp;t=113s
---
twas a good time to empty the buckets beneath the seat /s
---
you can choose between legion graphics, as in shadows, water, etc. or the classic presets which gives you the old textured water and the "dot" shadow etc.
---
What if you pick an orc because you want to look dodgy and unfriendly? What if you pick a dwarf because you want to look menacing and crazy-eyes?
---
But then someone toggles a setting on their side of the game and it completely changes the dynamic of your appearance.
---
It's like if people could use an always on augmented reality snapchat filter to always make you have doggy ears and a flower tiara. You might not want that. It's a similar situation with people changing *your* appearance, even if it's on their client side.
---
&gt;learn to swim
---
Because there's no water walking or flying mounts in vanilla?
---
And the RTS genre.. the fps genre isn't dead tho.
---
&gt; Not being able to go home because you need to hide out somewhere.
---
I used to skip with friends and we would go on very long walks in parks and malls. Or camp at someone's house if his parents werent home that day.
---
I'm not speaking for anyone else but the reason I played and enjoyed Vanilla from day1 to the last day was because of the world, the players and the sense of achievement of doing things that were difficult to get and not because of the balance of things.
---
I don't care at all if stats changes, if class gets rebalanced, if there are new object as long as it's not power creeping and making end-game PvE a joke (which I may add is a risk if nothing change and we get 1.12 talent from the start)
---
And as I stated: it's not hard to stay in that spirit: if you decide to not give all the class the same talents, to not make new content better than the previous and avoid all the things that are clearly not vanilla (TP to instance, LFG, flying mounts, transmo-pet-mythic) then it won't be a different experience. I mean it's like asking for new level in Super Mario Bros 1 on NES, let's not pretend that it's impossible to do as well and even better.
---
Perfectly valid points, but the reality is this sort of respect for the original classic state of the game, even the art assets, is in the vast minority.
---
The vast majority wants the option to be able to toggle modern Retail WoW models and animations, so I win.
---
Why wouldn't they? They play Retail WoW, they have certain demands and expectations, no real experience of Vanilla. Why wouldn't they want their modern models and animations over the classic art which most children these days see as old?
---
Vanilla is moderately difficult starting at level1, and slowly gets more complex, and the dungeons get more difficult as you level up.
---
Retail starts at -100 difficulty at level1, where you 1-3 shot everything, can play the entire game while looking at another monitor the entire time and are immortal for 110 levels, then have slower killing but are still immortal and NOTHING poses a challenge until mythic raids/mythic+ dungeons.
---
Personally I’m in the camp of I don’t care either way and I couldn’t give a rats arse what other people see on their screens. It was never the graphics that made the game awesome from Vanilla to TBC it was the game play, rpg elements and more importantly the people I played with.
---
I’m going warrior main. Probably level herbalism and skinning for gold early levels. The power level alchemy. Once I’m max and geared and have a decent gold pile I plan to pickup engineering because I can’t resist the fun of netting a mage in wpvp. 
---
&gt;What an extreme and stupid reaction, honestly couldn't care.
---
Yeah, and this is why you will never be in charge of something like this. It doesn't matter if you think customers are stupid for leaving the service. Their money is as valuable as those who stays. Nobody will quit because loot mistakes are being fixed, so Blizzard only has one choice until you people come up with a better solution.
---
&gt;There won't be any tickets for fixing loot, nor GMs answering them.
---
Your arrogant attitude about this issue is a 100% guarantee it will never be the way you want it. Either stop acting entitled and start acting mature or accept that your stance is irrelevant in the eyes of the company.
---
The plebians used TS, it was vastly inferior in that you couldn't make Microsoft Sam deliver the ROFLcopter.
---
&gt;idiots from official forum doesn’t count.
---
How about idiots on this sub?
---
Do a quick search and you will see that on virtually every single thread and post ever discussing this, the upvotes reflect that the "community" (which is majorly made up or Retail WoW players and people who have never played Vanilla) invariably support modern Retail WoW models and animations as a toggle over the Classic Art.
---
Here is a recent front page post about the topic, just check the top comments.
---

---
Being able to find a group more quickly won't make dungeons easier. More players per realm will also mean more players from enemy faction running around.
---
I used to play the old cs versions religiously. Must have had literal thousands of hours on them like I'm ashamed to admit how many hours per day I had in it. Then I started to focus on wow and now I cant do shit in shooters. Its very easy to lose aim skill. :(
---
Would you care if people used an IRL augmented reality snapchat filter to make you appear naked, or always have doggy ears and a tiara? Or do you just have no care whatsoever what you look like to other people.
---
Galo MC hasn’t even been confirmed for PC yet IIRC; though it’s heavily speculated that it will release onthe Win10 shit store.
---
They should have the caps set up higher at start, like 3.5k-5k, and then offer free realm transfers off of the more populated realms after a month if people so choose. I feel like that would help with balance more. At least this way people can volunteer instead of being forced to merge.
---
I never played halo

I find it funny how both devs and politicians are trying to milk us through nostalgia appeals
---
&gt;It'll give the people who already ninja more room. But those players just as before will be shuuned away from the community.
---
If the loot trading system allows for needed items to be traded then very little shunning will occur relative to unpunished ninjaing/buddy trading. It will be too easy to roll and win loot for a friend and trade it inauspiciously, whether that means transferring it after the run or transferring it quietly and then waiting to equip it until you are no longer present.
---
In addition, if there are four people in on the scam then it'll be your word against theirs. 
---
Full HD background version available ?
---
any1 got this in flac?
---
There's videos of chromaggus one shotting a druid. Just because it works on your broken pserver doesn't mean it's viable.
---
You could set up a pet fighting ring among hunters - best pet wins.
---
Like I said I don’t care what other people see how does it affect me? As long as the gameplay is the same that’s what matters most to me.
---
paladin tho it will be a bitch to play until you get some good heavy armor
---
it isnt balance when pvp druids barely do pvp and instead just sneak for the obj
---
myea lategame vanilla will be horrible for new players otherwise
---
Honestly, I wouldn't mind the idea of allowing people to toggle on their character what look for those sets they would like.
---
I mean, I guess it depends on how you define "demand."  Warrior's and Rogues's DPS values are very high, so they are in high demand within the raid that they're a part of.  But for recruiting, like you said, I presume the supply will just be way too high for demand to ever seriously rise.
---
That's why I went into a bit of a tangent about what "class demand" even is.  For example, if it's determined that the highest possible raid DPS is just Warriors/Rogues and 2 Hunters for Tranquilizing Shot, then what happens to any other non-healer class?  Zero demand?  But of course plenty of those classes/specs will still be in raids despite that assumption, so to me, "demand" is too abstract of a term in this context.
---
It's mostly because we're talking about an MMO, which means players that emotionally invest into their characters.  This isn't some fighting game or FPS where almost only the gameplay matters.  If we were all robots, no one would play anything besides Warrior, Priest, and Mage, but then it wouldn't really be a game.
---
I played LFR in 4.3. People used to gather up on Hagara's platform after the run to offer the items they'd needed on but didn't want. It got to the point where I'd only run with guild-mates and we'd all roll need for any items that any of us needed because that was what others were doing. 
---
That is human behavior. If a system is introduced that, after human behavior in the face of lack of consequences is introduced, mandates cheating then people have to either cheat or lose to cheaters. 
---
Girls would play night elves ! 
---
Want to take a wild guess as to how many more times you'll see it before summer? :V
---
If loot trading or right-click report end up in game, I'm gonna pass on Classic, I have no problem staying on pservers.
---
I think (and someone correct me if im wrong) that when they did the graphics update all the faces have the same emotion they just updated the quality as far as im aware. So i dont think that would be an issue. Besides i think its more about what you the player sees rather than caring if your face is slightly different to others. The benefit of the increased graphical fidelity for look, feel and even immersion outweighs that issue in my opinion.
---
Yeah it's weird, I've got nothing I want to play right now. I just want Classic. 
---
I just looked at the trees, moving those talents actually makes a lot of sense. And 35 points makes it not too deep for you to still go into other specs.
---
They're finally releasing the games past halo 1 on pc after being retarded about it for years
---
The reason this is said is because boss mechanics are a joke in vanilla, naxx has the craziest, and most of them are tame compared to the carnival ride fights in retail.
---
Obviously, I am not talking about having 51 point talents in vanilla that is ridiculous. 
---
But, I was talking to someone else that said the Tactical Mastery change from 5 to 3 points and repositioning of this talent, and allowing Warriors to retain 10 rage without the talent was a huge quality of life change that wasn't OP. 
---
Its stuff like that, that I think will make Classic fun for everyone.

Oh yes they did in Vanilla, I started at the release where most of the names where in English but they progressively translated everything in French.
---
So one year later when newbies would come it was sometimes quite hard to understand each other.
---
*Newbie : Where is "Baie du Butin" in "Strangleronces" ?* 
---
*Me : What ? Oh you mean Booty-Bay in Stranglethorn ?*
---
As far as I remember they translated certain names too, but not all of them. Nat Pagle is still Nat Pagle, but all the Taurens with "Hoof in the name where translated with "Sabot" something.
---
Thank you for reaching out, you seem to have a solid plan.
---
I'm still deciding on whether I'm rolling PvP or PvE, atm I'm leaning more towards the semi-hardcore raiding space since that what I'm used to.
---
There is still time left to decide and I will keep this PM for when I do!
---
Cheers!
---
Same!
---
It's just what I think I remember man, could be something completely different. It was fifteen years ago :D.
---
Hardest part was that I was a Rogue, but I think I was dagger specced and I had the Dal'Rend at some point later in the game if I recall correctly so I think I sold it for one of those two reasons.
---
No it won't, because if you as a rogue take a staff or a 2handed weapon.. It'll be kind of obvious. And people generally don't act this way, seriously. I really hope all of you paranoid players play on the same realm because it's going out of hand.
---
For the Forsaken! 
---
Haha, hadn't thought of that. Now I can truly go back in time and listen to new Tool while PvPing in Vanilla.
---
I think this is the correct answer. Things eventually reach equilibrium. The imbalance, which can go in either direction, is kind of what makes it fun too. It adds to the story.
---
Ask where he got his dress
---
My problem with loot trading is that there are ways to abuse it such that the ninja isn't even apparent.  If loot trading was as obvious as normal ninja looting, the most of my distaste for the feature would disappear.
---
We can't blacklist players who successfully hide their transgression.
---
damn. this is so long ago. at that time i was playing that songs by myself on guitar. i think i have to dig out some of those songs after work today.
---
Not OP but I played mage in classic and tbc. Rogues. Touched me. Everywhere.
---
I know of MobInfo used it on priv server, but was just wondering if it was needed since Classic is retail rewinded, so it might still be in there :) Thanks for the reply!
---
Really split between Orc Warrior and Orc/UD Warlock.
---
I played Warrior since classic with a lot of breaks. I like leveling so that‘s no issue. I don‘t have unlimited time anymore so won‘t be able to prepare hours for a raid. I heard that my chances are small to tank a raid without a big time investment. Will do some PvP but no healer buddy yet.
---
I think I should pick a Lock, as I can easily join dungeons/raids/PvP without much preparation. But my heart still beats for the warrior. Do you expect a warrior flood like on the private servers? Will I get the chance to tank?
---
I didn't see anyone arguing that obtaining gear and progressing your character happens quickly I feel like you've just fit that in there to fit your agenda.
---
People are however arguing that classic wow's mechanical difficulty and tactics are really easy which they are. Most of the fight's are just tank and spank, when you compare fights in classic to retail it doesn't even come close to mechanical difficulty required in retail.
---
That being said mechanically difficult content doesn't make the game. Sure i'd like raid boss fights similar to retail, which is probably the only thing that retail does well is boss fights. Vanilla on the other hand has a whole lot more to offer, boss fights aren't really that interesting but character progression and customization is great. The world feels alive. There's a real sense of community. A real sense of the world being dangerous when you're out and about leveling especially in encampments or keeps. Even on max where world pvp is so active you're always on your toes when it comes  to that.
---
Honestly I'd prefer if we'd get a game that was a mix of classic with retail mechanics but alas if I had to pick I'd definitely go for classic rather than current retail which is just disgusting.

I see what you did there

Right-click report? That's your problem and argument for staying on bot invested and corrupted pservers? Have fun then I guess. You may argue about loot trading, but [right-click](https://right.click) report?
---
I had been "tanking" most of previous dungeons with my shield up and didn't really understand why all mobs didn't attack me. At \~ 50 i was "tanking" with my warrior in Uldaman and some party member asked me why i didn't use sunder armor to build threat. I was like "Sunder? Threat?" and that day i learned first steps to real tanking.
---
5/5
---
This is what a slippery slope is. Your post is like something I'd have written to show exactly *why* the slippery slope - i.e. a series of decisions that compound upon one another and quickly become irreversible - is dangerous. 
---
No need to comment when you are clueless.
---
The game is mainly social. You can play any spec if you can talk to people. The better question is why you want to play something less useful, especially when you are new to the game. It's an interesting challenge if you've played the optimal specs already, but otherwise you are asking others to carry your slack in a high-level content environment.
---
This kinda depends though, issue is that retail is a lot harder to balance in for example the leveling curve, because at one side of the scale you have the 14 year veteran leveling his 20th alt in full heirlooms, knowing every class by hearth. You can't make the leveling proces hard for these players, while keeping it doable for the 8 year old that starts playing WoW tomorrow on a fresh account with no ingame knowledge whatsoever of the other side of the scale. That 8 year old that starts playing tomorrow won't be immortal or be able to autopilot himself to lvl 120 while watching a 2nd monitor. 
---
Plenty of rings and amulets will be upgrades for a wide range of classes, especially during leveling.  Also, many classes and specs will grab gear outside their armor class.  Non-clothies are going to grab cloth gear for spell damage and healing, and leather dps gear will be desired by more than just rogues and druids.  
---
How are they so competent yet so naive and anal.
---
Just frost it as fire if you're in tier 3. People are weird.
---
Did not come in Vanilla, I got a Lifestone fucking around somewhere in azeroth early during TBC.  To this day on all the private servers I've played on, still have yet to get an epic world drop while not in a group. 
---
It's only really bad for boe's, blue items from bosses will be anticipated and they will equip greens to ninja them solo anyways. Like getting the hat off whitemane and then putting your lvl 20 green on in a new run. Sure it adds another layer, but that just means you need to specify loot rolls before which should have been the norm anyways. I plan to try and do mostly reserved runs with diverse class mixups to avoid fighting over loot.

If you did that you would be called out as a ninja and shunned by the community. It only works for items that the one who rolls can actually use, and does not have equipped. 
---
The biggest issue with resilience is how it did split PvE and PvP gear. Some classes could afford going with PvE offpieces but some were pretty much stuck stacking resilience like madmen to just survive enough. 
---
It's also false. Millions of people quit WoW in TBC because of how it changed. Most of them have not played on private servers and also do not want Classic made to resemble TBC. I'm sure some of them are in this subreddit. I know I am. 
---
Most people played WoW for the sense of adventure and fun. All them gear scores and min-maxing that's now a trend were not as popular as they are now. You also couldn't find 120938123 guides and maps all over the place. 'twas a simpler time.
---
Are you from the Akama retail guild? 
---
Exactly this, I’m maining a holy pally in classic so I made a shaman, hunter, warrior and mage on horde; got them all to level 20. Had a bunch of fun and it killed 2 months, now the itch is gone and I’m just awaiting classic. After level 20 commitment starts to kick in and I don’t wanna spoil any zones so that was it for me, try it...it works!
---
enhancement loses to mages and potentially others.

If he picked up where he left off he'd be going into TBC

Sad how people can disagree with common sense.

You're amazing!
---
I see what you did here. 
---
You fabricated a reality to support your personal desires. You painted the people who want the thing you don't want as boogeyman with foolish, self-centered goals in order to make them seem foolish. From there it is implied that only a fool would want the same things as them. And you just happen to want something different. 
---
It's good political maneuvering. Sad to see it upvoted here, but that means it was at least moderately effective. 
---
That's why most TBC (and even WotLK for certain classes) arena comps had most hybrids as the healer... while the non-healing specs barely had comps available to them (even in WotLK enh had a single one - beastcleave-).

---
I'm not saying that people quitting a service isn't bad for a business.  I clearly said that someone quitting WoW because their boots were given to the wrong person is not realistic, nor should a company cater to unstable people at a detriment to every sane customer.
---
You should work on your reading comprehension skills before you start tossing insults.  Acting entitled is demanding Blizzard give a solution for a non existent problem, that means entitlement is demanding loot trading to make up for your own shortcomings.  Are you dense?
---
I will never have it my way?  I already have, Blizzard will not be recovered loot with GM tickets.  That's not an option you dunce.
---
Actually I totally agree with you there...
---
As this is a Role Playing game, it is important for some people how they look, how they play, how they feel. It's like Dungeons and Dragons, being the Wizard or Bard, etc.
---
This is something that Retail WoW players have little connection to, as retail WoW is little more than a single player Action game with multiplayer components.
---
The faces look quite significantly different in same cases, for example for the undead.
---
About flightmasters, yeap the first time u click on a flight master it has all kinds of routes and locations already discovered. I remember in vanilla at lvl 20 just going on an adventure looking for flight paths :D 
---
Its impossible to pull aggro from a tank nowdays, threat or aggro is a non-issue nowdays
---
Last official word from J Allen Brack was that they're "listening to the community" for it.
---
As the vast majority of the voices on this issue are retail WoW players, you can bet that they're going to be in favor of Retail WoW models / animations over the Classic Art.
---
Here's hoping that the devs have the better sense and still make the right decision.
---
Amazing work!!
---
Sorry, per Rule #4, we don't allow the encouragement of playing on a private server, and per Rule #1, r/classicwow is for Classic WoW discussion primarily, not private server discussion. So, I've removed your post, but please try r/wowservers for private server discussion.
---
I know your intentions are good, and I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but we try to moderate consistently when these posts appear.
---
What do tanks even do then?! Like, managing aggro was a good chunk of a tanks entire role before!
---
&gt;  the Blizz classic team will immediately capitulate to every single demand the shareholders have, because they don't have a choice, period.
---
I understand that people are hurt from how Retail WoW developed but this statement is nothing but absolute bullshit from someone that doesn't understand what shareholders are or how they can (and do) influence a company.
---
The only Services I forsee happening to WoW Classic is realm transfers and that is absolutely acceptable because those existed back in Retail Vanilla as well. Given that there will be a huge discrepancy between players starting and players persevering on any given server that's a good thing to have. I would not expect Blizzard to actually go ahead and do "Realm Merges" because that's one of those points where Blizzard is likely to see free cash.
---
But the actual ingame shop with mounts and cosmetics and whatnot - Blizzard clearly stated that this won't happen. And: THEY HAVEN'T US GIVEN ANY REASON TO BELIEVE OTHERWISE. You saying this is nothing but superstitious crap.
---
&gt; Vanilla is hard. People are going to be ragequitting just because they pull too many mobs questing and have to do their 4th 2 minute long corpse run. People have no idea what they're getting into.
---
I look forward to murloc areas covered in skeletons :D
---
You're the real hero! Thanks for the text version. As on the job, i am not able to watch YT! 
---
That's sound like a good solution. Especially if it's already been successfully attempted on private servers.
---
Vanilla isn't balanced around anything.
---
They did it because of player requests, though.
---
Share the guild, you'd like to join me? Of course man! I think I will make a post about it when we know release date, I don't want to start spamming now. But yes of course! PM me and we can add each other on steam or something.

eventually bought the item after they introduced transmog i paid 35k. 
---
&gt;obtaining all of your BiS gear happens quickly
---
I dont think anyone ever said that since its common knowledge that vanilla drops much fewer items than retail. 
---
Besides, yes, Vanilla is gameplaywise very easy. 
---
DPS rotations are extremly simplified and often just cd based. Mob and boss mechanics are very straightfoward and easy to deal with. 
---
You welcome my man! Hopefully there was thing or two you forgot about! :) 
---
They manage their damage reduction cooldowns and just react to raid mechanisms i believe
---
Usually there isn't more than 2 people in a group that would need/can use an item anyway...
---
Just break things off now before you guy join the same guild...
---
Yeah me too, i quit WoW 2 months ago and just started a to play on e vanilla private server. Its been over a week and play around 1-2 hours a day, if at all. This isn't really reasonable for retail cos everything needs so much time and grind etc.. i know i am still low lever at the server but yet i don't feel rushed. Every level i gain i feel like i am getting stronger, another talent point to spent to gain that 0.1% buff. Also getting a green item feels great too, just having that extra 20hp or 1 spellpower makes my spells notice able stronger yet not over powered. Hell this is so great. Allo random players are buffing you just to help you a little bit during your journey. 
---
i hope there will be some beta time too before classic launches. just because i cannot wait to play this game !
---
i am now at redridge mountain with my level 14 mage. Absolutely amazing. One thing i did not miss from vanilla are twinked rogues who kills for funs or lvl 60s ganking lowbies... 
---
I think the issue is any "new" faces or hair styles that show up in the improved graphics settings would be tied to an original vanilla style.
---
So it's probably not going to happen.  Blizzard is definitely not going to attempt making new vanilla looking faces etc. and they're not going to have more improved "retail style" faces than there are original vanilla styles.

There''s just a shit ton of variables.  Tue obscene amount of trash packs, the amount of bosses, the randomness of pats, annoyingness of certain mobs(summoners for example), and the fact that you're eventually going to have respawns as you get closer to the end.  There's just so many places where you can get caught off guard.  You get 1 res every half hour, and if you go over that and someone has to zone in behind trash, thats pretty much game.  Not saying it can't be done. I'm saying its completely unforgiving and punishing if you don't have a comp with decent CC.  And I certainly wouldn't say any of it is easy.
---
that combo would suck in classic in 3's.
---
Conveniently me and my friends will be playing classes with a lot of gear overlap if we get gear trading for the same purpose of stealth buddy trading. We will specifically set ourselves up to take maximum advantage and quadruple dip our rolls.
---
They didn't always reverse it. 
---
I hope I'm on your server and you want leather xD
---
NO CHANGES!
---
In my mind this would be the perfect solution.
---
Humans conform to the cultural mores they are subjected to. That culture is determined by the collective pushing the boundaries and finding what behaviors are most profitable within that environment, balancing advantage gained vs. punishment received. If it is profitable to be polite then it's a polite group. Ninja looting being only possible via an explicit act within an open loot system means that the rest of the group sees it and knows it. The ninja is punished for blatantly harming and disrespecting the group and a taboo develops around the act.
---
If loot trading offers people an advantage that can be safely acquired with subterfuge, then, like politicians taking bribes from "lobbyists" and corporations polluting because their competition pollutes and lawyers ignoring the intent of the law and turning justice into a game...people will conform to the new culture. 
---
How to solve the problem of loot mishandling tickets:
---
Tough shit, click better next time.
---
That is exactly what I would expect a 500-member Alliance guilds poster to look like
---
Vanilla was much less action-oriented, much more strategic
---
If they aren't smart enough to give a piece of loot to a priest instead of someone else that counts as a wipe in my eyes and they don't deserve the loot. 
---
I can't be the only one who wants to right click the cauldron...right?
---
The very issue isn't that is *doable* (it is) but the amount of grief, neglection and contempt you'll have to endure. The amount of idiots that will feel you're robbing their gear. The amount of guilds and pugs that will *encourage* to go the fotm spec and/or ignore or kick you if u reject, not to say that even if you're successful in all of this any mistake may be your last in that raid and maybe in that spec or guild. And well, expect to be given little gear since other classes *can use it better.*
---
It is doable but at the same time a long unfriendly struggle for a not-so-high reward that most will avoid. 
---
30/21 feral-NS is a solid 5-man spe  at 60.
---
You mean we'd have to actually make friends and can't just pug everything in an MMO? How horrible... 
---
Why should you have to trade it? If you didn't want it why did you roll on it?
---
I like the idea of "Classic Remastered", but I play classic for the gameplay, not the graphics.
---
*Logs on to Warlock* Or you could **embrace** your sins.
---
New pc for 13 year old game lol 
---
The only playable version of Classic was limited at level 19. So this is either a pserver photo or an old photo from vanilla. My guess is a pserver.
---
Yup, and smart people will make sure as much loot fits into that "only" condition as possible, like my group if it comes through. We abused this so much on live and never got caught.
---
That is usually the case, yes, but there is plenty of opportunity for "I need it for offspec" --&gt; trade it to buddy after the run. 
---
In theory the goal of loot trading is to get an item to the right place. Introducing a system that makes it easier to get items to the wrong place seems illogical, especially because of the social cost of such a system.
---
The only thing that makes any sense to me is to allow players to return loot to the corpse. Then it can be relooted by the group using whatever loot settings they currently have. All visible. All voluntary. 
---
I also don't get why people think that the only possible manifestation of hard is "mechanically intense", as if anything that doesn't require fast reflexes isn't hard at all.
---
This isn't a shooter mate. Something is "hard" when it's difficult to achieve. That includes r14.
---
Can't tell if they knew who wanted what before hand and made sure everyone that could use the item has a worse item in that slot. I have some this so much to people like you lol.
---
Does the classic aesthetic have nothing to do with what Classic WoW is meant to be?
---
Perfection
---
Harsh wording but I fundamentally agree with you.  They say "people make mistakes" well slow down, take a second and properly hand out loot.
---
The responsibility ultimately falls on the shoulders of the person in charge of loot distribution.  If you have loot problems, then the obvious solution is to question and think really hard about who you're putting in charge of your loot.
---
Some jackass in the comments claimed he would quit if his loot was improperly distributed.  I think most normal people would turn it into a funny story or a lesson learned but you can't please these entitled instant gratification kids.  Gotta flip loot distribution on its head for them.
---
Lmao, yeah! Some kind of kinky red lingerie/latex outfit together with that lamp and the torturing poker from SM😂. The night elf strippers went bankrupt once Baeby entered the business and all the gold was thrown at her way👀. 
---
I lost all screenshots from Nost tho sadly☠️. 
---
it's too late man, a small indie company can not forsee possible problems
---
Would you be willing to upload them to an imgur/dropbox/google images/mega.nz album? That way you could release your current map in this context but also include a link to all previous works. 
---
I've been enjoying your stuff and had hoped to eventually download them all when I'm on my desktop PC. 
---
Let us have vanilla. Stop trying to change it 
---
&gt;And this was a problem that occured daily and took a lot of GM time until loot trading was implemented.
---
I raided during retail Vanilla WoW in one of the two most hardcore raiding guilds on our server for years, and I raid today on a pserver in a 15/15 Naxx cleared guild,
---
and **only once** have I *ever* seen a loot mistake. It was in ZG and the ML didn't see someone's roll, and he gave the loot to the wrong person. It was upsetting, but a GM wasn't even contacted about it.
---
Seriously, people who have actually played Vanilla, how many times have you actually seen a "loot mistake" happen?
---
That being said, loot trading in a ML environment is not a big issue and most people would be perfectly fine with that.
---
Outside of ML, *absolutely no loot trading.*
---
All my previous work is available to download for free at

---
No
---
Also I thought people wanted to just play the game already, so more changes would mean more development time
---
Actually Gnomes are even better than dwarves a lot better take it from a guy who mained a rogue from 05 till ... well i still main one.
---
Well I mean... yeah. Why even listen to those people in the first place?
---
Just go out and enjoy the game. 
---
Make him go to a Boarding school or a preparation course for such if he's not old enough yet
---
Best Parent ever
---
Good old plaguelands
---
NO! Ok im out of here... again NO
---
Right, what I am saying though, is people who are anti sharding and would rather have server mergers down the line (like the did back in the day) would face this problem, and its something I absolutely don't want to deal with.
---
Sounds like you're projecting your disingenuous practices onto others...
---
Loot is final is the solution, its rare for something to be **that** simple but this is.
---
"Oh but what if we give binding to a priest?" Dont give your bindings to a priest?????????????????????????????????????? 
---
Dont make your ML someone who cant focus for two seconds, and not implement a system that would ruin pugs.
---
right click report is not only automated, it silences you which would make it borderline impossible to play in Classic as you cant talk to anyone. 
---
Not just talents in WotLK but glyphs, if there was one thing I could bring from there to classic, it's definitely inscription. Sure they could have been a touch braver making them all worthwhile rather than 3 or 4 per class that was just too much better than the rest, but I fucking loved the extra layer of customisation they gave.
---
i was leveling in elwynn on the most played pserver recently, for shits and giggles. That murloc spot north of logging camp was littered with corpses. It was EU primetime and the surface area was equally covered with gras and corpse. shit was hilarious :D
---
Awesome !
---
My biggest issue with loot trading is that it's a solution to a problem that doesn't exist.
---
Does anyone remember back in vanilla and TBC that it was a problem that people ninjaed stuff constantly? Happened maybe a few times, and you'd never play with them again and their reputation on the server was ruined. And it was very rare that people would accidentally need something anyways.
---
I played probably 2½ years on vanilla private servers, not once did someone get loot they weren't supposed to. So i don't really understand what this is good for.
---
Is that the chicken from the 3 escort quests in vanilla? 
---
You equip your saved green gear. And just needs on everything u can use. Then sell to vendor. Free gold ftw 
---
You saw it once, now add 6 000 000 - 10 000 000 players doing dungeons, raiding etc. It's enough if all them them saw it once or twice and it's a few full time jobs to do it.
---
Stop being stupid for something that'll only speed up a process that already existed in vanilla through GMs.
---
That is the exact spot I had in mind :)
---
That's something that'll happen both with and without vanilla anyway, and hopefully something people will recognize and shun you for.
---
So awesome
---
unless you are in greens as the druid, the warrior has no hope of ever catching you long enough to do any real damage, moonfire has longer range than charge so he really only has one gap closer which has a 30 second cooldown, so unless he kills you in the 3 second stun from intercept you can powershift away while using natures grasp with rejuv on yourself and he will never catch you.
---
Please tell the name of your future toon in classic here, so everyone can just avoid dealing with retards like you 
---
And if you use the item it's too late, and if people are as paranoid like most or as un-honest and sad as you. It'll become a requirement to just put it on after you loot it, so your plan fails.
---
And thankfully I have friends enough to form a guild so we'll play together, mostly to not having to deal with people like you =)
---
You never farmed baron cape or truestrike i hear
---
Which one? My mage account rogue account or druid account? DW I Have 70 wow tokens from botting the last 2 expansions and $300 on each account. That's a lot of name changes.
---
I feel this deeply. Had to check to see what I was doing 21 hours ago in order to dismiss the possibility that I have an alternate personality. 
---
There is some small solace to be found: yes popular culture is, indeed, spiritually bankrupt and reformed into a social engineering machine to acclimate young people to a mindset tolerant of the decline desired by people of...a certain tribe. 
---
There are still many great works being released though. They just tend not to have absolute top level production quality. 
---
To gear friends and guides overall randoms
---
&gt; The slippery slope is very real
---
Nah. As soon as the community is very vocal about it, Blizzard won't go further that the changes that are claimed. Remember, they are actually listening.
---
Many things won't be 100% Vanilla-like already, you can't deny that, do you? We would be already damned then because of slippery slope, but seems we are not. Do you get it?
---
Many changes have aready changed between Classic and Vanilla. We're already fucked because of slippery slope then, right?
---
Yeah? When my memories are right, there was an ignore list in classic. Normaly when I report someone, I also don't want to play with him or even talk to him. Still can't see the problem.
---
Lol. They literally just showed those last months that they are listening to the community, a bit more to come, and that's no reason to have trust in them?
---
why cant i downvote posts more than once? :(
---
Which is exactly the point here. Balancing the talent tree has absolutely no reason to cause other things like LFR, sharding, or whatever.
---
Especially if you were me and you were never any good in the first place! Only shooter I was good at was original CoD. I wrecked everyone with my Kar98.
---
A reminder: stay on retail
---
I was real good back then
---
if 4/5 people in your group are rolling on baron cape you fucked up 
---
Explain what changes?
---
Not really. You just dont have mage or lock in group
---
Do you get what OP is about? It's about TBC class/talent balance, nothing else.
---
Truth is I'd have no problem with loot trading if I expected to play amongst honorable people.
---
I've actually struggled in life with being too earnest and honorable. To the point of naivete, really. At 15 my buddy and me found $20 on the floor at Blockbuster and gave it to the desk in case someone came looking for it. 
---
I've been realizing that it has not served me well in life. At all. Most people have no interest in the common good. I've been working to become more of a self-serving prick but it's very much against my nature. 
---
Chill dude, the community will help you in that
---
Frost Shawk!
---
Pet battles give XP that scale with your level so they could be used to level faster.
---
Other than that, they don't affect gameplay in any way.
---
If they added it to Classic *without* XP gains, I wouldn't care, they're totally optional.
---
That is the charm of classic. A rogue and warri can take away the bis bow of a hunter for stats
---
Im a feral tank currently killing C'Thun every reset in a raid that spend well under two hours on the raid. Feral is fine for raiding.
---
On the other hand, specs like enhancement, retribution etc is objectively bad. They offer ZERO utility that cannot be brought by other specs like Resto/Holy, andt they can never get close to dealing comparable damage to more traditional DPS classes like rogue, mage, furywarrior etc.
---
The issue is not "private server babies" (whatever the hell this means). The issue is just that you are asking other players to put in extra effort, flasking, getting world buffs and consumables just to make up for your class just having shitty mechanics for dealing DPS.
---
Understandably players may not be that motivated to play when they spend lots of gold on consumables just so the raidwide DPS can be the same as if you replaced all the memespecs with rogues and nobody used consumables.
---
A reminder: Stay in retail
---
Ironic how your entire comment consists of ad hominems while accusing the other party of immaturity and lack of arguments.
---
But hey, the circlejerk took your side so enjoy the upvotes.
---
In my server, no one I knew was hostile to "un-optimal" specs. Specially because no one had a clue about it. If anything, I would say that most players ran an un-optimal spec.
---
I mained ret in 40 mans. I remember at least 1 moonkin and another ret with us, several ferals, and not that many fury warriors contrary to what we hear in private servers. We went up to mid AQ40, and didn't go further because of TBC coming. Also, basically no one except the tank I think consistently had consumes active.
---
I mained protection paladin in 20 mans and lower. Everyone loved that, we had lots of funs, and not that many wipes in comparison.
---
Yes we didn't clear MC in 45 minutes, but hell we did have fun. It does not mean that we wouldn't have fun if we would clear it in 45 minutes, but no one needs "help to get optimal" in a ***game***. As long as you still can practically do things, that's fine.
---
To be fair places like this are substantially harder on private servers due to dynamic respawns. Before you even kill 1 murloc, a new one will respawn right beside you. They simply respawn so damn fast that you can't effectively clear anything.
---
Just inplement it in the way that needing always bops the item
---
wow tokens, you really think that would help you in vanilla ? it was a mistake to add in retail even, they are loosing money on it. and also, when you spend 2w-1 month leveling, then you are gonna bis gear yourself, and no one wants to bring your chars to groups, and you cant name change. HF
---
I leveled 3 warriors to 60 in Vanilla (not pservers), 2 of them 70 in BC.  
---
If you want to die less, you need to be careful about each encounter (pull instead of charge if necessary) and hit green mobs. Yes it's harder and longer but it's not that bad.  
---
Is this original? If so its great stuff!
---
First character was a Tauren Shaman. He shall be resurrected for Classic, but in Orc form, since I'll have a Tauren Druid as well. 
---
Always loved both hybrids, each with their own idiosyncrasies. I really miss being able to easily interrupt spells when I play a druid, and conversely I miss any kind of crowd control when I'm on a Shaman. Healing I find better on a Shaman, especially Chain Heal, and I find their Elemental DPS build better than Druids too. However, I'll be tanking on my Druid, with some healing if needed, so they both are fitting more into different roles. 
---
One thing I do find odd when people talk about not wanting to play a Shaman is having to drop all those totems. To me, this was never an issue back in vanilla. You just click a few buttons and repeat when needed. Nothing major really. 
---
lol when has that ever been the case?  everyone knows hunters roll on everything.
---
You know, I haven't played a PC game in years. 
---
I think the last one was Diablo 3  (before expansions) or World of Tanks. I never really cared for private servers because I never thought it could reproduce original WoW. 
---
I'm turning 43 this summer and I started playing WoW 2-3 month before BC cam out until around the end of Wrath. I was never interested in any of the expansions that came afterwards (Pandas...lol).
---
I don't even own a PC that can run any type of modern game now. Gaming has switched to mobile games and a tiny bit of PS4 for me.
---
But you know what? When I heard that Blizz will rerelease Vanilla my mind went insane and it hasn't stopped. My new PC arrives today, I made a whatsapp group for all my friends that played WoW in the past and almost everyone is super excited. We are planning our characters already. It's so much fun!
---
So far I have a good feeling that there are still enough people at Blizzard to understand what all the nostalgic players want.

Don't feed the troll guys.

1.12 talents will mess up some stuff and make it not like vanilla.
---
Then go reply to their comments asking for bigger pop servers and merges down the line. 
---
honestly thats the main reason i will play alliance. cause of female human model. i played since tbh and 95% horde. female bloodelf was so beautiful. but since that is not available in classic i will go with human.
---
Aren’t they adding loot trading to make stuff easier on GMs?
---
Thanks Larkonath. I'll trust to first names to at least staying as they are then, which should be enough for players in non English speaking countries to locate the questgiver.
---
I never said I can tank EVERY boss in the game. I said Druids can tank raids.
---
Just because you were able to list one of the only bosses in the game that Druids CANT tank doesnt make any of what I said less true.
---
But if you want to keep believing private servers are broken because you are too stupid to understand that we know how the itemstats work and how they affect the damage you take, thats not my problem.
---
Oh, and before I go:
---
&gt; There's videos of chromaggus one shotting a druid .
---
I'd love some evidence for this one ;) I mean I died on Chromaggus myself yesterday as an offtank, but the issue is not crushing blows. The boss crushed me for 3500 damage (armor cap remember). I only died because Hunters did not tranq shot the boss due to time lapse and it attacked me too fast. Same exact thing happens to Warrior tanks.
---
The real reason Druids dont often tank Chromaggus is because they cannot use Hourglass sand in Bear Form.
---
TL:DR: You are just an idiot who refuse to aknowledge that how people approach the game is very different from 2006 when the game was not yet fully understood.
---
Ask to instead explore his wetlands ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I already had a discussion with that poster. You can look for it some comments down it you want.
---
All the stuff he talks about how 1.12 talents screw with early raid balance don't matter much since they are temporary. After a year or so once the majority of raid tiers have been released classic 1.12 will be almost completely identical with vanilla 1.12.
---
yeah actually i did. About the weather effects, how differently is it to retail?
---
So when WoW first started you had a poster with the BC logo? LoL! Just bustin’ chops, man! That poster is fantastic!! 
---
Played a Shaman as my main from TBC through till Legion. Plan on picking it up for Vanilla. Currently the only thing I'm having trouble adapting to is dropping totems individually. In TBC / Wrath I had a macro that cast all 4 types at once. 
---
Is this just a thing on servers or in Vanilla in general?
---
No matter what, HYPED.
---
Well, Generally any time I see anything relating to sharding I state make sure to post saying I don't want mergers and name changes, but then sometimes I get people who seem confused about the whole thing.
---
the guild started at the beginning, sometime later I made the poster and a website with "secrets" to wow gold, I had everyone farming and the guild became rich very quick, then I scrapped it and stole all the gold and the bank....lol , that was my hidden agenda, noone knew.
---
Lol bet your 'Friend Group' is a fun bunch of ~~people~~ virgins  
---
Oh I see it now, you replied to a guys reply 3 deep into my comment thread thinking you knew what we were talking about.
---
Yeah, i consider myself an above average player and i have played vanilla WoW hardcore and levelled a bunch of characters in vanilla and on private servers. I still die quite a few times while leveling and that's when i am fully aware of what i have to do and what i have to avoid.
---
I always lvl my droods as balance/resto and the extra armor bonus from chicken is great but it doesn't compensate the fact that you can't heal while chickenified
---
they only suck in mass pvp

Don’t play BFA, seriously

Some of the best PvP I ever engaged in happened in EPL
---
I've been leaning hard toward shaman too, and I've had the same experience. In vanilla it didn't seem like a problem, but now everyone hypes it up to being like playing a piano.  It's kind of intimidating, because it's been so long since I've played.  I'm thinking to myself, "was I just a really bad shaman?"
---
I always used the keybinds on the 1 - 9 bar, but always remember clicking totems too. I would be interested to get some perspective on this. 
---
I wasn't talking to you specifically at any point until you replied to me, all I was saying was that I want healthy populations of players down the line, and I don't want to have to be subjected to name changes and as long as they meet those two criteria I really don't care if they use sharding or neo sharding or whatever they would like to use.
---
I really just want to sign up for Classic beta. Can I do that?
---
Go 31 points fury and the rest in prot, you will have the best of both world (you really only need the increasing threat talent in prot).  
---
You will lose tactical mastery though, no stance dancing.  
---
Enough with this. If you want to play retail graphics game play retail. This is Classic with vanilla graphics. Why is it so hard to understand. People want the old game thats the point of Classic. Not something between vanilla and retail
---
&gt; You just click a few buttons ... 
---
Get out
---
Fantastic idea
---
*Laughs in hunter*
---
A shaman or a paladin would probably be much better than a priest, unless you want to main the priest once 60.
---
I tested out contemporary WoW recently. It was a trip. How can you have literally unlimited mana during low levels?  Sucked all of the fun out of it. 
---
Rogues have one of the hardest rotations alongside hunters. Not hard, just hardest relative to spamming *one* ability.
---
In my experience enhancement shaman is really good in the early life of a server, this is when your wf procs will be devastating but they are really hard to gear so they fall of mid way through in pvp. Most matches are rng/skill based only thing almost always beating you 1v1 is hunter enhancement is really hard to play tho on a equal skill level almost any other class is better and you kinda need spellbatching to beat locks and sp
---
Remember, patience.. discipline!
---
I picked those two because I like raiding/running dungeons on them, not because I think they are the ideal combo :)
---
What a fucking retard.
---
I'd like to know if all the hamstring kite warriors here have leveled to 60 with it or they are just parroting what they hear from Youtube.  
---
Who has the patience to do this for a minimum of 6 days of played ???  
---
This is cool for 5 minutes until you agro half of the map and you die.  
---
Other than that they don't affect gameplay in any way, so if they added it *without* any XP gain I wouldn't care.
---
IMO though they would fit better a mobile addition to retail because when they added it in Mists they also literally flooded the world with new critters, there weren't that many around before so if they did it in Classic you may have "problems" finding pets to battle.
---
If they added it as mobile to retail, you could still use it in Classic "idle" time, like someone else suggested in this thread.
---
Uh..so you delete them after they've passed threw and people stop seeing them on the feed? That makes 0 sense man.

Whatever, like every content creator here you'll look for money out of us soon.

You don't need to buy BFA. If you just reactivate you sub + do the full game download you can play up to legion.  You can't just download until Xpac something. It's always the full game. If you download the full game you can even play without a sub till level 20. when your Char dings 20 you can no longer gain XP. Or you need to get a sub.

Things ppl tend to forget when they talk about this subject is that all private servers have dynamic respawn and classic probably won't. So atm we can't really say what is better what we can say is number from private servers have a high probability to be wrong we will have to wait for beta to get better numbers 
---
I dont think you should take this guy litterally. He is trying to make a point. The point is, Loot Trading is bad because the community is full of douchbags.

I saw that too.

Although im a little biased because i know i will be of the guys camping flight points.

Mental stability and moral character quickly come into question.

Yeah I’ve levelled to 60 using the method recently and I’ve also levelled to 60 not using it back on Darrowshire, it’s easy and requires less patience imo than stopping to eat after every single mob. If you’re struggling with it, use the max camera distance command and zoom out or play from a Birdseye view. Try strafing in circles or backwards to a safer spot and you won’t run around pulling everything like a headless chicken. Once you’ve killed one or two mobs, remember their spawn time and always strafe back to that safe spot. But hey, if it’s too difficult for you to grasp and you want to triple your downtime then power to you. 
---
No loot trading. This isn't wotlk where dungeon loot doesn't really matter. 5 man runs with strangers will see some of the more relatively coveted drops in the game, and upgrades are generally harder to obtain. There's greater incentive to engage in underhandedness for loot.

I didn't make this video, FYI.

yeah i can smell the bullshit also, i just dont like it xD

Most don't understand WHY we want to play it. They think we want to relive our glory days or whatever. We want to play it because it is a completely different WoW than what is available to us today. This is not why me and my friends want to play. It's really a matter of opinion. Whether it's the playstyle of your class/spec, Azeroth as it was back then, or maybe you want a WoW with an actual community. Faces you recognize, on both factions. Now you don't even bother to read others names because not only do you not have much of a reason to but you'll probably never see them again. The absence of flying mounts also makes the world more lively, and dangerous. There really is no zone that is dead and playerless. 
---
Run while you can
---
Okay, so where can I send my application?
---
During real vanilla, not private server vanilla, nobody cared. You had ret paladins going into MC to be buff bots or spamming flash heal. Only the absolute best guilds cared. Everybody else was casual.
---
Atleast he looted a 6slot bag ;)

1. Agree

2. Agree. I do 1 point in Improved Hawk Aspect and 4 in Improved Pet Health.

3. Agree

This is the kind of quality memes i subscribe for

I mean, when I created my first character, I enjoyed sitting and reading the quest log to try to figure out where X cave or camp is. I am actually afraid that with all the information available now and the different mindset, we might get the same game, but certainly not the same experience. Most of the threads in the subreddit are about what's the best race for this class, will people hate me if I play this class, what should I play. I remember just going in and creating that Night Elf druid because it looked cool. Quests for forms? oh my god that was awesome. It was more about immersion. :) I can't wait to just go back in, create a character and quest away, throwing every person I meet a mark of the wild. :) Don't overthink it guys, go have fun.
---
I hope people aren't misinterpreting my comment as hating on druids.  Druids make some amazing healers.  But they're achilles heel is only having 1 rez(battle res) on a half hour cooldown.  So if your druid healer is the only rezzer, the pressure is on to not making any mistakes.  A lot of these can be mitigated with a solid group comp(shadow priest or shammy for alternate rez, hard CC like sap or poly, etc) but LBRS is pretty notorious for punishing you for small mistakes.  Especially if everyone is chasing their attunement, they'll most likely be fresh 60s with sub-optimal gear, or people below 60 that arent going for attunement, but you brought them along because you couldn't find anyone to fill the spot.
---
I am!
---
My girlfriend started playing in cataclysm, somehow we ended up playing a vanilla pserver and she LOVED it.
---
She would spend hours leveling professions, aiming for specific items from low level dungeons, thinking about talent builds that would allow us to dominate stv, crafting useful potions...
---
Turns out, seeing the game as an RPG instead of just focusing on endgame is what she likes the most. Deadmines staff is a milestone for her, for example. She'll spam deadmines on any caster she levels until she gets it, and she screams out of joy when she wins the roll.
---
Now we don't play anymore (saving ourselves for classic) but she's hyped af about vanilla.
---
I can't figure out how to PM on this but I'd be really interested in knowing more about this if you can message me!

**Hidden Agenda’s World of Warcraft Guild Charter**  
---
**Overview**  
---
Hidden Agenda will maintain a powerful and friendly presence in World of Warcraft, as well as offering many things to the World of Warcraft community. To date, we offer wares in local market, as well as regularly participating in dungeon raids. In the future Hidden Agenda intends to participate in guild wars, battlegrounds, world events, and other such happenings as they are revealed. Hidden Agenda strives to be a positive force in the ranks of the Alliance, and set an example for all adventurers to follow, but most importantly, Hidden Agenda is about having fun as a group!  
---
Hidden Agenda is, by nature, a non-aggressive guild. While we happily participate in PvP of all forms, we maintain an honorable approach to player combat. Hidden Agenda houses no griefers, ninja looters, or any other such lowly characters. We are of the firm belief that if PvP is approached with the right attitude, it can remain an enriching and fun experience, no matter who emerges the victor. A gruelling, punishing defeat is a humbling excuse to rise above, and a well-earned victory is cause for pride and a sense of accomplishment. Most importantly, Hidden Agenda loves to have fun, and we strive to make the World of Warcraft experience as fun for ourselves as it is for those around us, and never to derive pleasure at another's expense under any circumstances, even in such heightened circumstances as PvP.  
---
Hidden Agenda is an alliance guild, housed on the Khadgar server. Officially, Hidden Agenda houses no members on other servers, and no members of the opposing faction. However, our members may have alternate characters that do not belong to the guild, and as such, are not restricted by the laws of Hidden Agenda in any way.
---
No means NO! x)
---
Why is this 
---
I'm sure the nochanges crowd will jump me for even suggesting it but I wouldn't mind seeing a cap on stats in BG's. You can keep your cool set bonuses etc from naxx but the stats cap out at bwl level gear etc. I don't want to make people in greens have the same stats as bwl or anything, just tone down naxx/aq gear so the pvp stays healthy.
---
Ugh I don't look forward to these cauldron areas 😧 Place was brutal
---
I always went to kalimdor as a undead after tirisfal
---
Almost all of those items won't be available (or will have diff stats) at launch, assuming they do the progressive stat changes.  For instance - Burial Shawl and Crimson Felt hat weren't in game until I think 1.6 or 1.7?
---
Put back the bear!
---
In vanilla as a healer in pve I had 15 buttons keybinded it is almost 3 times that in pvp, totems might be castable from macros sins they had no gcd for part of vanilla, you still have to be able to change them individually cleansing totems and tremor for example. Was defenetly my favourite healer tho. Alot more reaction based playsyle then any other healer
---
Pretty sure name changes only became a service in tbc right? Along with most paid services actually if memory serves right
---
" he one shotted him you goober "
---
Stop trying to use the plausible deniability scapegoat, everyone can see through it as clear as glass.
---
Yeah man i agree with you, if blizzard is gonna give us tools to grief players in classic while staying within ToS 
---
ESPECIALLY if change from classic 
---
Then fuck yeah ima abuse it. Im gonna play mage and im gonna get so much gold, doesnt matter how much blizzard changes the game from private server, i ALWAYS find out the best way to make money. Gonna bully the shit out of the caster in my group till im the best geared mage. No one is gonna kick the best geared mage despite the master looter never giving me a piece of gear
---
But the content that gives the best gear in Modern WoW is much harder than anything Classic has, and that's a fact. Sure the difficulty floor is extre.ely low, but the difficulty ceiling is extremely high,"artificial difficulty" or not.
---
&gt;it's most certainly faster than warrior, paladin, priest, and shaman
---
Hahaha, is this a troll post? Priests are one of the fastest levelers in the game after Hunter/Warlock. Zero downtime and high damage with the ability to easily take on and chainpull multiple mobs due to insane mana efficiency when getting killing blows/wanding.
---
Paladins and Shamans also both have very little downtime and can easily deal with multiple mobs.
---
Warriors and Rogues on the other hand has no self heal, and hardly any tools to take on more than one mob. Rogues can do it, butit requires the use of cooldowns and downtime after getting out of combat.
---
No it was seen 14 years ago... The post is about vanilla, not classic.
---
For an experienced group perhaps. I doubt your average player could get through a normal 5man instance painless since those required CC and coordination. Everyone has been conditioned to just "go go go" since 5mans have been so easy the last few years
---
Dude I just told you I played Warrior since the Beta. The point is not on how to level a Warrior, its how hard its compared to other classes!
---
He was on my server (Destromath US)
---
&gt;When did I say one shotting someone took skill?
---
you answer
---
&gt;" he one shotted him you goober "
---
mama's wrong again 
---
Try and stop my sexual deviance homeboy.
---
To show you how involved I was, Here was my plan....
---
Hidden Agenda’s Organization
---
Hidden Agenda is composed of: The Guild Master, First Officer, Officers, Veterans,and Members, Boosters. The Members vary in rank based on their length of service, but aside from the more notable title of "Veteran," there is practical difference in rank for example , the amount of daily transactions in the guild bank..
---
Hidden Agenda also employs a rank for potential members, the Initiate. It is important to note that members of these ranks are not full-fledged members, but are allowed to wear tabards but not represent the guild in any official fashion.
---
**Becoming a MemberFor those interested in joining our ranks, we ask that you acquire a sponsorship from one of our members in-game. This can be done via partying for quests and instances, as well as general communication. Once sponsorship is acquired you are deemed to be possible** Hidden Agenda material. A member will invite you into our lowest rank of initiate (see below). While in this rank, we encourage you to get to know the rest of the guild, and we'll try our best to get to know you in return. After a few days have passed, your membership will be reviewed. If the overall feeling about you from the guild as a whole is good, and you have levelled up at least once while still an initiate, you will be promoted to full membership. The privileges of being a full member are outlined below.\[Note for recruiters: When you recruit a new initiate, make a public note of their character level at the time of their joining including the date they joined, so that we know when to review their membership.\]The only exception to these rules are in the case of alternate characters. Alts do not require sponsorship.
---
**Member Rankings and Privileges**Guild Master All privileges*Must* *wear tabard in-game*Officers Officer forum access Private forum access Public forum access Able to promote in-game Able to demote in-game Able to invite other characters into the guild in-game Able to set Officer Notes, Message of the Day, and public notes for all characters in-game
---
Veterans Private forum access Public forum access Able to invite other characters into the guild in-game Able to set Message of the Day and public notes for all characters in-game Allowed to wear tabards in-gameMembers Private forum access Public forum access Allowed to wear tabards in-gameInitiates Public forum access Allowed to wear tabards in-game
---
**Rank Descriptions**The Guild Master maintains all aspects of the Guild, but not without help from his Officers. He will direct the guild in operations, meetings, and events. He will take care of required guild duties in-game, and out.
---
The Officers act as lieutenants towards the Guild Master. Officers help with large tasks that the Guild Master cannot accomplish on his own. Officers monitor the conduct of the entire guild and report to the Guild Master when deemed necessary. Officers also act as advisors to the Guild Master, offering their opinions on important issues. Qualifying as an Officer entails many things but most of all trust, and responsibility. A member is promoted to Officer only when the Guild Master feels that he/she would qualify as one.
---
Veterans are members who have been with the guild since its founding or who have shown extraordinary qualities in playing WoW. Although their title is mostly a symbolic one and officially carries no greater privilege or responsibility, they carry it with great pride, for Veterans are revered as peers and mentors to all members, and are of the highest calibre that Hidden Agenda has to offer.
---
Members are the meat and bones of Hidden Agenda. They are an army of respected, honourable players who seek to maintain the guild's reputation of being a great bunch of people who enjoy playing World of Warcraft in a fair and mature manner.
---
Initiates are players who have only recently been recruited into the guild. Initiates are effectively 'on probation' for 10 days after joining. If, in that initial period they can prove themselves worthy, they will be promoted to full membership.
---
**PromotionsPromotions are based upon a combination of three things: your in-game level; the amount of time you have been with the guild, and evidence of your willingness to use your in-game time to help make the guild a more enjoyable experience for all members.**
---
**How do you get promoted? Well it’s simple. All you have to do is ask an officer. As long as you’ve met the requirements for promotion you will be promoted.**
---
Requirements for promotion from Initiate to full Member:
---
1. Register on the forum
---
2. You must be a guild member for at least 10 days.
---
3. You must have achieved an in-game Level of 10 or higher.
---
4. You must have levelled up at least once during your time as an Initiate.
---
Requirements for promotion from Member to Veteran:
---
1. If you haven’t already, register on the forum.
---
2. You must be a guild member for 1 month. Your forum registration date will be used to determine your time in the guild.
---
3. You must reach an in-game level of 20.\[Note: You may see players who are veterans and below level 20 in the in-game guild list. These are most likely the alternate characters of guild Officers, promoted to Veteran status so that they can continue to recruit new members without having to switch to their main character.\]
---
Requirements for promotion to Officer:
---
1. Forum registration is mandatory for promotion.
---
2. You must have been a Veteran for at least 2 weeks.
---
3. Help other Guild Members. Be able to cite several examples. This is deliberately not explicit, so that we don’t exclude things. However some examples of things that can be done are:---&gt; Coming to the aid of people lower aid or lower level who request help in guild chat.---&gt; Help walk lower level players through low level instances.---&gt; Use your tradecraft to help out your peers or lower levels.
---
In addition to following our basic rule of "respect" (as set forth in the Guild Charter), one of the main considerations for promotion to the rank of Officer or Veteran is consistently showing maturity in game play and dealings with others. However, if you have a good idea that will help out the guild, post it. If you’re willing to take the initiative to head it up, you’ll be on your way to Officer rank.
---
**VotingIdeas that affect the whole guild will be subject to a vote by all members. All members have a voice, and therefore Officers, and Guardians have equal power in any vote. All members are strongly urged to participate in the voting process for voting in new members. In order to keep the guild as tight of a group as it is now, as well as keeping personality friction out of** Hidden Agenda, we need as many members to vote as possible. In order for an Initiate to be accepted as a full member, all Officers must vote yes. The Guild Master reserves the right to veto any vote.
---
**Member ConductThe following rules apply to ALL members:** **Do not irritate your fellow guild mates. Excessive spamming of communication is prohibited. At the same time, communicate!** **Nobody likes a mooch. Don't take advantage of the other guild members in any shape or form.** **Obey the rules of the server. Any member not following these rules will be subject to disciplinary action or removal from the guild.**
---
**Player vs. Player (PvP)Khadgar is a consensual PvP environment. As such,** Hidden Agenda will actively participate in the PvP offered by the server and support the rest of the Alliance in guild wars, raids, battlegrounds, and consensual PvP in the field. All members are expected to conduct themselves with the highest honour during all types of PvP combat, and behave in a mature, non-griefing fashion. Battle is an exhilarating, challenging experience, and we try to make it as fun as possible for all parties involved, whether Horde or Alliance, attacker or defender, winner or loser.
---
&gt; The biggest issue with resilience is how it did split PvE and PvP gear. 
---
Which is code for "I enjoyed rofltomping people with an unfair advantage using PvE raid gear, and I am sad because I now lose to people who put the time in to PvP".
---
I have never been a huge PvPer, but I think it's completely fair that people who put the time in to PvP get better PvP gear than PvE raiders.
---
Did you even play vanilla?
---
Amazing!
---
This is exactly the kind of dark art style which I love for my wallpapers!
---
1. question: Is there a 1920 x 1080 version?
---
2. question: Are there more images by you? Give us a whole gallery! ;D
---
Honestly I think they should consider rebalancing at least the raids even if they don't touch classes. I am afraid the raids are going to be very easy with 1.12 specs, thankfully they have spread some of the problem till later (DMF/DM buffs, 1.10 items. I just want the raids to offer some level of challenge, particularly for players who are getting to experience it for the first time.
---
Start running - the fight between a druid and a lock in T1 gear would just be two unkillable guys that don't deal a lot of dmg fighting about who has the longest attention span. 
---
Except when the changes are common in private servers, then people are all for them. Like nerf gold farm etc.
---
They could do low polygon models of the new options in literally seconds. 
---
This post is irrelevant. Blizzard has already stated that they’re not making classic to appease to current subscribers (retail players) and focusing on bringing back an authentic classic experience
---
We should be able to do height and weight adjustments.  I always wanted a fat rogue 
---
Yeah it funded my epic mount as well!
---
You've lost, you sank to personal attacks, meaning your heart isn't in your argument.
---
Please do! 
---
genius
---
What about every 1 out of 4 of your stuns being resisted by orcs?
---
I am not sure how much sense it makes for you and your buddies to, say, roll two rogues and a warrior and then try to get into groups so you can funnel loot to yourselves. The healer's not going to want your loot, there's no way another warrior or rogue will want to join a group that already has you three in it... so how does this scheme benefit you exactly?
---
Mindless Self Indulgence making a comeback
---
God this is so dumb. I love it.
---
Except EMFHS was trying to fix that fuckup that was TBC racials and its impact on faction balance
---
The problem is people can gang up on peolpe and mass report them, ruining their experience.
---
Been waiting long for this.
---
1. How good is shaman in PvP? 1v1, 1v2?
---
2. Which is better for PvE, healing or dps? How good is the dps? How good is healing compared to other healers?
---
3. I have a mage main. How different is the dps compared to the mage? (I know this is a stupid question)
---
4. Can a Shaman hold his own in world pvp? I watched some videos, and I see that he totaly can, but in the videos it happened all so fast and I can't evaluate if the opponents are bad or not, since I'm not a good pvper.
---
5. Is it hard to learn Shaman compared to other classes?
---
6. Which spec is best for dps?
---
7. I want to roll a Tauren Shaman. Is that acceptable?
---
Well there we go! Talk about it enough and someone is bound to show up who knows!
---
&gt; That is usually the case, yes, but there is plenty of opportunity for "I need it for offspec" --&gt; trade it to buddy/briber after the run. For example leather melee gear might be sought after by five members of some dungeon groups. 
---
If healers are "needing for offspec" on melee gear in UBRS or something that's going to get called out as ninja looting straight away.
---
I can see some niche situations where this could be exploited in UBRS, maybe, but in the overwhelming majority of 5-toon runs there just isn't going to be much scope for shenanigans. There are only a handful of items three or more people in any run are going to be able to plausibly roll on, and unless three people are rolling it doesn't matter.
---
Make your own groups/guilds and you can do whatever you want, when ever you want. There are no limits to this or anything else besides those you put on yourself.
---
That said, nobody has a responsibility to cater to your needs. If you want to join a particular group but don't want to adhere to their requirements, that's a "you problem".
---
Silverpine is honestly a very underrated zone
---
&gt; I played LFR in 4.3
---
Well there's your problem then.
---
It's a raid, so there are lots of people who can plausibly roll on every item, and it's cross-server so there are no meaningful consequences.
---
In Classic there will be no LFR, no cross-server raids, and raids will not be rolling on loot except for maybe the odd MC/Ony/ZG pug.
---
THUNDERFURY JUNIOR:

The Masterwork Stormhammer is a main hand mace that can be crafted by Master Hammersmiths (Blacksmithing). This weapon has a chance on hit to cast a chain lightning spell on up to 3 enemy targets for 105 to 146 nature damage, mitigating as it chains. I wanted to highlight how cool the chain lightning proc is, so I made this video. Hope you enjoy!
---
hey there, original artist here :)

If you seeking to be a guild's MT as a pally you're unlikely to be successful.
---
In terms of less critical roles you can get away with whatever, just know that you'll won't necessarily be contributing as much as somebody else of the same class. Which is fine if you're okay with that.
---
For everyone to get in the mood:
---
I like my games toxic, so with or without loot trading im fine. Im of the mind, you fuck up who get the loot, then tough shit. And also if a group tag teams the drops and I dont get nothin, then tough shit.
---
Then people will stop randomly grouping and form groups of trusted players they can play with. Thats fuckin bullshit right(?) I dont need no frind making in my mmorpg(!)
---
Is the chain lightning damage affected by your stance? One clip you were against gnolls in zerker stance and it looked to hit harder. Makes me wonder if this had to do with stances or something else. Either way, thanks for sharing. 
---
You're not wrong. Every girl I've ever played Alliance with chose a night elf.
---
&gt;You've lost
---
You clearly dont understand how an argument works. Something is either true or it isnt. I am never going to be nice to people like who you keep posting nonsense that can be disproven by literally two seconds of research.
---
Druids have the class mechanics to tank almost every boss in the game, and they have the gear to support this. This is fact, and its not any more true just because I am nice about it. Nor does it get any less true when I call you an idiot for stating false information about how the game functions at a very basic level such calculating the effective health of a particular class based on available equipment.
---
I dare you to post this video you keep talking about of a Druid getting literally oneshot by Chromaggus while wearing apropriate gear for the raid. If you do not post this video I think we can reasonably conclude that you are just a lier who makes up anything you want just to "win" an argument on the Internet.
---
But I suppose saying something completely fabricated and untrue is fine as long as you are being nice about it right? :D

This whole thing went from mildly cheesey to you being a complete loser.

Fully experienced exactly this last night. We even had decent group/players, but the randomness of patrols ended up wiping us twice. Also managed to ninja aggro on Crystal Fang (thought it was group of normal spider) which made for another fun corpse run back for me :)
---
By your original response "you goober" that would be implying i was wrong that it didn't take skill to one shot.
---
You can't get out of this, and your attempt of getting away with it was terrible.
---
It happens from time to time, people are human &amp; miss things  - it happens. It also happens that the mistakes get hyped, and there are questions. If someone is dishonest about loot, I just don't group with them anymore - in vanilla, it's easy to get a reputation &amp; that will follow you for as long as you play the character.
---
I'm sure everyone has a story about how they (or someone they were grouped with) got screwed out of loot - that isn't a reason to introduce loot trading, which sanctions a form of loot distribution that isn't compatible with vanilla.
---
Exactly. it would'nt take long to add a handful of features per race. 
---
Plus they probably still have access to the whole WCIII models to begin with and then remodel it from there. 
---
I see your point. On the other hand during classic I got reported  countless times (hardcore raid guild and people loved to troll us). In the the end it's just a QOL-feature. A GM will have to check your account anyway. And trolls like that won't last long. Bots and Goldseller on the other hand ... 
---
To some degree yes. I mean it's an MMORPG after all... but then you go to orgrimmar / ironforge and you find atleast 10x characters with the same hair/skin and feature as yourself.
---
Kind of ruins your unique'ness in the game for me.

It would take developers and a handful of artists 1 session to complete this addon. WIth the amount of fan art and depth the whole Warcraft enterprise has it would'nt take long to find new models and code them in....
---
But you can have confidence in them not wanting to canibalize their own products. It would be a really bad business decision to make classic similar to retail. That is because both aim at different types of players. The retail crowd, that likes retail is already subscribed. Them playing classic in addition makes no difference sub-wise. But new (and old) players subbing to play classic because they do not like retail actually nets blizzard more money. It's as simple as that.
---
1. good in groups, especially when drops a totem for friendly warror. Plus you may have seen cherry-picked PvP footage where a shaman one-shots people - this is RNG based... but looks fun
---
2. Healing, unique raid healer with chain heal and totems
---
3. While leveling (enhancement on average) with 1h weapon and a shield you are a cross between a melee DPS and off-tank. In the end game (raids) elemental nature damage doesn't synergizes with lock debuffs so it's trash while enhancement is RNG-based and usually is also low. Plus mana efficiency
---
4. If you have a FAP and use it before rouge locks you - you can win. If a mage slows/roots you - RIP. Solo WPVP is usually who attacks first while having level and gear advantage. In groups shaman gains a lot of value
---
5. No. Just drop correct totems and chain heal...
---
6. Enhancement for leveling and later on you can go ele/resto popular build.
---
7. Mooo... yes.
---
Where do you think you make friends? In pugs
---
1)Elemental shaman is excellent in PvP. You've got huge burst, the ability to heal your teammates and a number of support skills. The only downside is that you burn through your mana really fast if you're not careful.
---
2)Shaman PvE DPS is really poor regardless of spec. Elemental goes OOM fast and doesn't benefit from crucial debuffs like warlock curses. Enhancement does very little DPS and the only reason to bring this spec to a raid is to let the shaman swing [Nightfall](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19169). Restoration is in high demand, since your healing is pretty good and totems are excellent.
---
3)The only way to be brought to a serious raid as a shaman DPS is to spec enhancement, autoattack with Nightfall and switch between Windfury Totem and Tranquil Air/Grace of Air Totem to keep both buffs up at the same time. However, the raid would probably still be better off bringing a dedicated DPS class instead.
---
4)Yeah.
---
5)There's lots of stuff to bind, keeping track of totems may be annoying. Harder to master than a paladin, easier than a druid.
---
6)For PvE it's the enhancement buffbot spec with no Stormstrike. In PvP, it's elemental with Nature's Swiftness.
---
7)Tauren is a great choice for elemental PvP due to the fact that War Stomp has good synergy with your bursty spells with short cooldowns. Troll is technically the best class for PvE due to Berserking, but it's not mandatory.
---
Can't go 5 yards without stumbling over a ghoul/zombie/diseased bear/spider, or all four if you think you can run...
---
But also, why would they? If you ran a business and somebody turned up and told you that they're below average but want the same money as everyone else, you probably wouldn't go for it.
---
Although you are a veteran, the current state of the game might leave you feeling overwhelmed, so I would suggest you start at r/wownoob and work your way from there.
---
I'm not going to say do or do not play BfA, but if your sole intention is classic beta, you're waiting like the rest of us.
---
Welcome back to the war soldier!
---
Sometimes the rain REALLY affected your gameplay, in those rain storms the view distance is much lower etc. I dont know what it is, but everytime i play on pserver and i see the rain i IMMEDIATLY notice it like "holy shit its pouring" but in retail i NEVER pay attention to weather for some reason, i think in retail its just decoration but in vanilla it actually affect your vision etc 
---
But they have already made these decisions and know the result. Whether or not they like their decisions in retrospect is of no consequence, because more importantly it would be a really bad business decision. Because if the slippery slope would play out we would end up exactly where we are now again, thus not making revenue from people that like WoW, but hate retail.
---
And everybody against loot trading isn't asking for more GMs, they're asking Blizz to just say loot is final and deal with it.
---
Remember Lordaeron!

Happy to know that the only thing you could say back, is comment on where I post.

Thank you, kind stranger. This really cleared up a lot of things.
---
One minor question. So for raiding which spec should I use? Healing is the best for endgame? I like the idea of it.
---
I'm thinking of having two shaman characters. One for PvP and one for raiding.
---
oh sorry, to answer all your questions properly:  
---
1: pm me your email address and I'll export you a 1080p version if you like  
---
2: see my other reply  
---
3: takes me about a day, but a lot of that is just preparation, doing studies etc, so hopefully I can become a bit faster with time :)
---
I am not worried that they are turning classic into a carbon copy of retail but I am worried about their approach to class balancing (homogenization) if they were to attempt it.
---
&gt; 1v1 ownage, u need to be SL with T1-T2 mix
---
yeah you need high stam gear to scale well
---
That still undermines your original post.
---
If the work is already done, it would be odd not to.
---
Hi, /u/bugsixx
---
looks good for holy pala farming
---
1. Ele shaman is great in groups and holds up well 1v1. 1v2 can be difficult. Locks will give you the most trouble followed by spriest. 
---
2. Healing is your only real option in PVE. Dps isn't very good at all. Healing you're bottom of the charts, but the utility you bring is unparalleled.
---
3. If you did dps it would probably be as enhance and your priority would be to keep your totem up and just auto attack. 
---
4. Most people you encounter in the world will be bad, that's just how it is. An ele shaman can destroy people on the world. They're very fun when you hit 40 and can get a guaranteed free crit on someone with chain lightning. 
---
5. Shaman has a high skill cap in pvp, but the basics are very easy. 
---
6. If we're talking PVP, elemental. In PVE, again, you're better off healing, but if you insist on dps, enhance is probably the better option. Enhance is hard to gear for as you're competing with hunters and rogues for gear and they will get priority over you since your dps doesn't matter.
---
7. Tauren shaman is great. 
---
I'm in your same exact condition, class preferenced included :) I think I'll play alliance, but will make a horde alt
---
This is where I’m supposed to downvote you because you said the “R” word in the affirmative, but I’ll forego your sentencing on account of the content drought we find ourselves in.
---
I can’t watch classic cast. Tips doesn’t pay attention and it just seems like a bunch of dudes talking about the same information we have had forever. I think what I hate most is I can’t respond to them on things they don’t know or remember correctly about vanilla.
---
Great post
---
The totem bar wasn't there until wotlk, right? Macros should work the same as in tbc so if it was a macro then, it should work in classic.
---
Youre right....no wait, wow has content with more than 5 players.  Guess you were wrong after all.  
---
No changes.
---
Gnome mains are psychopaths in my experience 
---
Thanks so much! I really love it when this community help each other out. 
---
You were really helpful! 
---
So to clear up, Resto is the best for raiding? I like the idea of being a healer.
---
here is an easier alternative https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=9651
---
Didnt say i was a gnome main i said i am a rogue main. 
---
&gt;A great feral druid is pretty damn good
---
Leader of the Pack is something that Rogues &amp; Fury Warriors will salivate over. The Faerie Fire is nice, and takes that burden off of the healers. But the Feral needs to be able to hold up their own end, as well.
---
The Feral charge talent interrupts spells, but requires bear form. I'm not sure if you knew that or if you meant that requirement makes it more difficult. 
---
I doubt you wont get raid invites just cuz u are a dwarf
---
I agree with you
---
Sup grill wanna go to gs?
---
Is this even a question.
---
iirc  
---
 totems have a small delay which would prevent a macro from dropping them all at once. You can do it pretty quickly and if you want to get cheesy you can turn 90 degrees after each drop and your totems will stack on top of each other. Good for pvp as you can try to hide grounding totem or something in the middle of the stack.
---
Yeah use smilies and insults that makes you look like someone to trust regarding your erroneous opinions.
---
The reason being that you needed a geared guild of 40 in a game that slowly geared everyone up and most guilds didn't last long enough for that.
---
play with bleeds? then cleanse with stoneform to reset
---
Can't wait to find out what proc rate weapon ends up being in classic. I want to love it, but on a certain private server the proc rate is utter crap.
---
something to consider too would be the almost doubled size of the client having to store 2 sets of assets for all their models, textures, terrains, etc. you might have it toggled for modern 3d assets but all those old assets would be there. even ui assets
---
it wouldn't exactly be doubled since sound, and the game files themselves wouldn't be but you get the idea. 
---
I personally only thought Val'Sharah and Azsuna were really nice looking in Legion. But though they were nice, I hated leveling in them. I don't know if it was the design or the quests, or what but especially Val'Sharah irked me when I had to travel anywhere. The environment felt bland like stated above. Pretty, but bland. Nothing ever interested me to go branch off and explore. I just felt like in each zone you pretty much got the feel for the zone the second you stepped foot in it. No diversity within the zone.
---
Before I quit playing BFA at 119, I thought the zones on horde side, Zuldazar, Vuldun, Nazmir were all really pretty and interesting. I liked Nazmir the most as I remember the temple in the center kinda blew me away when I first saw it. So for sure the artwork makes for prettier scenery now days.
---
But I still think Kalimdor, Eastern Kingdoms, and most the zones from TBC had more interesting things to explore even if they weren't as pretty as recent expansions. But this is just my opinion coming from someone who's played every expansion since vanilla (except BFA since I only hit 119).
---
How on earth would that work?
---
Most people dont want new models. They want Vanilla as it is.
---
Implying horde girls existed pre-TBC.
---
i feel bad for you
---
Yeah, resto is definitely the best. Ideally, a raid wants enough resto shamans to provide totems for the tank group, the melee groups and alternatively also the warlock group.
---
Why wouldn’t they be? No one can oick them but I’m sure they’ll be there
---
I legitimately lost IQ watching this.
---
I watched it like 8 times. By the end of it, I was in tears laughing. This is so stupid, it's amazing.
---
Ohhh okay. sorry my memory is a little hazy it seems.
---
The dark theme of your paintings manages to awake a sense of wonder in me which goes deeper than the first but superficial impression of desperation.
---
*What is behind those trees?* *What would one find beyond this ridgeline?*
---
Keep doing what you love because the results speak for themselves.
---
Considering Warriors were topping vanilla dps that's not too bad
---
/punt
---
Hmm, now you say so, i recently started playing on a pserver and i was like... something's not quite right..
---
I also remember duskwood to be very dark, dawn, scary etc. didnt had this feeling when i leveled a new toon in legion but then again i thought maybe my monitor has a brighter screen now or some other settings i didnt had back then. can't wait to seek for duskwook as my toon is now lvl 14 on the pserver :)
---
Also bear stun, cat stun, and tauren stomp. Way worse than shaman's shock, but I found it fun to rotate through all these options.
---
I gotta agree, the info just keeps getting repeated over and over. I mostly watch for background noise and the odd Vanilla stories that they/guests  might share.
---
Would humans actually quit because they didn't get a bit of loot? I'm not saying you're wrong, I just can't imagine being that human.
---
cant get past the "non-officialness" of a private vanilla server... Retail BFA is about an un-official vanilla as you can get
---
I'm calling you a fucking goober because you're a fucking goober. One shotting someone doesn't take skill you just decided to get uppity about it as if a resto shaman being the target is the reason why it doesn't take skill. 
---
Master troll or world class idiot, consider me impressed regardless. 
---
I'm lost? 
---
Lol look i got downvoted because I don’t like classic cast.
---
MMOs are not hard by definition.
---
You basically nuke and cc things accordingly. Or healand dispell. Or tank and swap agfro, meanwhile getting out of the bad.
---
Fighting games are hard, plataform games are hard. Not MMORPGs
---
Back in retail there was loot trading, just to be clear. You made a ticket and a GM would solve it.
---
What happens is that on some p servers there's not enough staff to handle the tickets or they have a policy against it, so when there's loot drama people quit the server.
---
That is a problem those who want WoW Classic to change from vanilla have to address or the game will be negatively affected by it. Nobody back in vanilla left the game because a GM had fixed a loot issue though.
---
Well I'm not going to be selfish and hog all the fun now am i? How uncharitable of you good sir.
---
I think it's because you were talking positively about retail. The r word being retail.
---
Basically circle jerk classic whilst hating on retail. 
---
Those murlocs will SWARM you
---
If you think about how many people actively play on private servers at the top level, it's not actually that many, spread all around the world.
---
Assume there will be some on your server and they will do very well due to their knowledge, but there are tons of people who haven't played vanilla since it was new, and they'll be returning to, as well as players who have never experienced it.
---
If servers are full of private server tryhards then classic has failed, because the total players would have to be extremely low.
---
Currently clearing Naxx on a server. 
---
Currently clearing mythic Dazar on retail.
---
Mythic raiding is extremely hard &amp; far more difficult.
---
Vanilla is difficult and grinder to get Flasks for every raid. No where near as hard as Mythic raiding. 
---
We just downed 4 Horseman btw.
---
Not really, the warlock talent refresh was pretty minimal and didn't mix things up in any major way. The two major changes to locks were giving Death Coil the horror effect instead of just a life drain, and the 1.8 change to compress dots to do the same damage over a much shorter time.
---
Cool.  
---
    
---
The rest of us who aren't complete assholes (or obvious trolls like the OP) still don't want it.
---
Oh you have options yes, but they don't have the ease of Earth Shock. 
---
"everyone" will follow it, while that's just prediction it seemed like the case in private servers, a lot of people followed it
---
Its quite iconic whats happening right now. The community literally made a company re-release a game in a state that was loved. I started WoW in TBC and stayed on pservers at WoTLK. But boy am i exited to see how it all began. Back then we would compete with classmates on leveling,gearing and acquiring ingame wealth and those days are gone but since we are more connected as a community than ever before we can atleast taste the old times. 
---
&gt;Healing you're bottom of the charts, but the utility you bring is unparalleled.
---
I don't know about that. Chain Heal bouncing around the raid with some +healing gear would have to be generating a ton of heals. 
---
&gt; Could you make Classic a better game than vanilla was? Absolutely
---
That’s debatable. Many people consider Classic’s talent specs perfectly balanced. 
---
Not everyone was meant to have 3 viable specs. Druids for example were meant to be jack of all trades master of none. Many specs like survival or hunter offered you interesting builds but were slightly sub optimal, *and that’s fine and does not need changing*.
---
This notion that every single spec needs to be viable, and every single class or profession or this or that MUST be competitive, this is what destroyed WoW
---
It started in TBC and it’s warped into ugly retail that exists today 
---
Meh
---
When it comes to raiding there was a time in vanilla where everything was accepted, but it didn't last long. Then people started to use raid comps from successful guilds.
---
Also there was the issue of: If you *can* heal you *have to* heal, because healing classes were very underrepresented (and still kind of are).
---
Another issue is that it is very time consuming and hard to test a spec. Now after pservers we know that Shadow Priests, off-tank Feral Druids and even Enh Shamans and Ele Shamans have their unique strengths over other specs/classes and can clear all the raid content. But a lot of people are still stuck the old circle jerk. There are still specs that are simply not good like Oomkins. They have been tried and tested and they *made* it though content but they never did something better than some other class/spec did and everything else was worse.
---
Btw you mentioned fire mages. Those are actually optimal after MC/BWL. Warriors are used as Tanks *and* as DPS. Paladins are currently only used as healers with very few exceptions.
---
I'm aware. However, of the two options, "allow sharding" and "no sharding", only one prevents that chance from ever happening, the "no sharding" option.
---
Great news
---
With your wow sub you will be able to do all thrnpet battles to your heart's content!
---
Just not on the classic client.
---
This is true, it is mostly regarding the fact that all time and work into a character will definitely  become obsolete. 
---
As what you call an “old head” lol I think you will find a very large portion of us having more limited play time now and trying to make the game fun for ourselves and everyone on our server.
---
The risk of elitism I feel is more from a very very small minority of the player base and I don’t think anyone should point that at the private server community either. The majority of the private server community I have directly interacted with or community interactions I have witnessed have been great people.
---
TLDR: there is a very small minority of a player base in all games that are called elitist,  usually just assholes, that do not represent any other group in the community 
---
changes, no?
---
But changing classes in a way that all speccs are viable, while being unique (like they were in TBC) is still far away from the homogenization.
---
To give this a more personal perspective: I am currently planning with my best friend what we will be playing together. He wants to play a feral druid, but is still unsure because he knows that he most likely will have to play heal druid in end-game. Being stuck with a certain role, when your hybrid class is supposed to be able to choose their role, is just not fun. If specced right, a hybrid class should not be nonviable in any of their possible roles.
---
I would turn you down as a Ret Pally if you couldn't explain why that spec does something *better* than an other spec/class. So far I'am not convinced but I'am not a Pally expert either since I exclusively play Horde.
---
But the quintessence is: You need to be able to convince ppl yourself if you want to play a weird spec like that in a raid. Also you need to convince *yourself*: If that spec is actually benefitial, would you bring 2? 3? 4? Answer that question honestly and you are on the right way.
---
If they ever do go the route of classic plus/osrs and start adding content they will have to figure out the main staples that made classic wow work. They’ll have to have certain things that cannot change no matter how much bitching and whining. 
---
Things like flying mounts, arenas, lrd/lfr among other things cannot come to vanilla wow and can’t be put up for community vote. 
---
A reminder to this sub: you’re getting loot trading whether you like it or not. 
---
Tbf, he's somewhat supported his argument and you have not.
---
So you oppose to the planned general upgrade of graphics too? Or it would hurt you so much to add some new eye colours and a fucking gnarly mohawk for gnomes or what.
---
I can definitely sympathize. When everything in my game library becomes dull and repetitive after months of use, WoW was always there for me to mindlessly grind on until the next big thing. The division 2 should be a good distraction for a while and Sekiro drops in a week, so hopefully I'll be able to hold out a little bit longer. 
---
I think the main problem is that the bad specs are "doubled" in badness because of the people who play it.
---
Usually people with the mentallity of "play what you want and have fun" are the clickers, keyboard turners that don't even know how to use their interrupts/dispells/aggro dumps etc...
---
Very few people are like Shado for instance, that played a Feral Druid and decided to study how to be viable/competitive. No, most people will be terrible on top of a terrible spec.
---
Min/maxers already have a, well, min/max attitude, so on top of a "perfect" spec they'll study BiS item list, optimal rotations, buffs, consumables etc...
---
In short, a guild of min/maxers could do most content even in bad specs, but the "play what you want and have fun" people wouldn't be able to finish BWL even with the most optimal specs.
---
It over heals a lot so your effective healing is a lot lower than the priest who can use flash of light, greater heal and heal. You also need to keep your totem buffs up and, if you're good, twist between them when healing isn't needed. 
---
&gt; I've actually struggled in life with being too earnest and honorable. 
---
Says the person how in the previous post admitted to scamming their fellow players out of loot.
---
&gt; I recognize even that sentence looks absurd
---
That's because it is.
---
First girl I ever met on WoW was an undead mage.  
---
She made an Alliance warrior. GUESS WHAT RACE
---
See ironically I found locks among the easiest to blow up
---
Coil can be trinketed, fear cast can be kicked, and then it’s a straight brawl, CoA doesn’t help if you’re already poisoned
---
You have to stay very geared for your level and be quick on the sacrifice button if you’re gonna stand a chance vs a rogue, unless he sucks
---
Exactly, but that is still a totally different story than #nochanges
---
Personally I think that another thing that should never be a thing in classic WoW+ is a new continent. There can be new areas within Azeroth, but all the content needs to be intertwined with the existing world imo.
---
Haha, you guys need to watch the video before going all serious :)
---
Two issues with that.
---
1) If the hard stance is no changes, then they can't start down the slippery slope. Compare it to a closed and locked door vs a door slightly ajar. One is much easier to get into the room through than the other.
---
2) Historically, the hardcore crowd has always generated less revenue than the casuals. This isn't a gacha game where you can rely on whales for your income. They need more players, and expanding who the game appeals to increases the playerbase and makes them more money.
---
So combining those two issues brings up the very likely scenario of them going "well, we've already made this change, let's expand on that to get more people playing and make us more money".
---
Imagine being a combat rogue. 
---
Running BRD for the hell of it. 
---
Ironfoe drops. 
---
Everyone needs, mage wins it, passes it to the hunter. 
---
No launch of any vanilla server had the crazy expected numbers that classic is looking at, and neither did it have dynamic spawns to deal with that like the p servers implemented that are used back and forth for this argument
---
Exactly! There was tons of wpvp over there aswell, so if the mobs didn't get you the other faction did.
---
Actually in hindsight I still enjoyed myself because it felt so good finishing the zone.
---
Shots fired 
---
A reminder to my landlord:  I don’t want to pay rent
---
Why tho? If you like WoW and want item X then go into a dungeon and don't get X, how will quitting help get X?
---
Yeah, no kidding. R is prime hotkey real estate.
---
But that is exactly my point with this post. There is no additional revenue to be gained by catering to the casual crowd (again). Because they are already playing retail, thus already paying their subscription.
---
I must have had the wrong video settings if the Forsaken models looked like that in-game...
---
Extra trinket slot? You can't trinket stun but you can trinket fear. Ud is better in pve for boss fights that have fear.
---
&gt; Why we can talk about minor changes without fear of the slippery slope.  
---
Because Blizzard won't implement them
---
Classic is Vanilla (as best as it can be). It's not "Vanilla+", it's not a new MMO. There should be no changes whatsoever. Otherwise we are back at square one of Vanilla not being available. It *absolutely* doesn't matter what "little" or "good" changes you are thinking about or want.
---
If you want a different ("better") game, ask Blizzard for it. Ask them for a "WoW+" (or whatever you want to call it). Just leave Classic out of it.
---
Bad specs are bad cus their bad
---
More annoying when kiddos like you try to act like you have a clue about anything.
---
I don't suppose you could make a couple in 1920 x 1080 so it can be used as a wallpaper could you?
---
There's as many reasons for playing and quitting as there are people in the world, everyone has different reactions and attitudes towards things. I think people feel way more entitled in WoW because it's a subscription service though.
---
Class changes
---
In my opinion Classic nailed it by NOT handholding every single class to be equally awesome
---
You went druid? Then u get 3 classes and won’t be best in each but you can use all 3 AND u get move speed AND stealth 
---
Went paladin? You’re a plate wearing truck of a healer but even as ret spec you’re not gonna do top dps
---
When TBC rolled around blizzard gave in to all the whining and made every class spec viable 
---
It nullified things like rogue where they were pure dps with 3 dps specs
---
Suddenly paladins we’re out dps‘ing rogues AND could heal AND could tank like monsters
---
TBC was the beginning of everything being normalized and equalized.
---
Classic struck a fantastic balance between class and spec uniqueness, viability and playstyle 
---
*they're 
---
wotever
---
Nagyon szep munka mind, well done!
---
sure :)
---
You likely won't be in the same level range as them on fresh, they'll be nearly done with Pre-BiS before you're 60, and they'll be raiding with their guild after that. 
---
Good one.
---
Yeah, right. Bizzaro but true I guess.
---
Thottbot during vanilla had a suggested auction price for items for a starting off point, but it varies server to server obviously.
---
Got it.  The one point in Imp. Shield Block makes sense just to get that 1 extra charge, subsequent points just increase the duration.
---
Bummer about Deep Wounds!  Though I might pick it up anyway as I don't intend on doing any serious raiding, so might not be a big deal.
---
Looks like an album cover
---
....
---
With songs such as 
---
1. You raise the roof; we raise the city
---
They probably didnt translate the names until in BC (at least in german). See the discussion in the official forums: https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/de/wow/t/eigennamen-wieder-in-english/13856
---
We don't know how it's gonna be this time, but it they translated the complete names where possible:
---
https://de.wowhead.com/npc=12435
---
How does your guide work, do you only want to translate the names?
---
Does the guide work solely with the map?
---
That was the point
---
Specs had one best and others were fun but not optimal 
---
If you’re paladin you’re a great healer not so great dps and crap tank
---
and THATS FAIR
---
Suddenly TBC rolls around, paladin can heal, dps better than rogue (wtf) and tank nearly as good as warrior
---
Because every idiot kid cried that they wanted to top the dps charts as paladin and blizzard caved in
---
Vanilla is and always will be the best approach to specs, classes and the world immersion
---
I'm tired of repeating myself, re-read what i said before.
---
But we would not be back at square one. We would have something that is very close to what Vanilla was back then, probably scratching the same itch.
---
Let me ask you: Why do you want the exact copy of what Vanilla WoW was?
---
Those undead have a very Dark Souls hollowed feel to them..
---
Fuck, imagine a WoW themed dark souls style game.. 
---
I don't think it's nostalgia. It was just genuinely a better game back then. All my opinion of course. Can't back person experience with facts. 
---
I have a bit of a dilemma though. With how Blizzard have treat their paying customers recently, and how bad they've butchered current Wow, I really don't wanna give them my money to go back and play classic lol. 
---
It's a bit petty I know. But I'm sick of these massive companies taking advantage of customer loyalty. They got 14 years of subs out of me and literally hundreds of faction/race change fees! 
---
In other words "Blizzard should change the system to cater to edge cases, that can be prevented by people paying attention"
---
Yea fucking hell no.
---
this  
---
and besides, you should never be worried about stuff like that, it's a video game after all, if someone's being a jerk just tell 'em to fok off
---
&gt; People are wiping in Scholo because they're not nuking the ghosts even today.
---
I don't think people who learned the mechanics *back then* are still getting them wrong nowadays, it's probably people that didn't know them in the first place.  
---
&gt; If everyone knows exactly what they're doing and executes it perfectly, then yes, everything works smoothly.
---
&gt; But requiring everyone to have knowledge and coordination... that is hard.  
---
Nothing different from retail, in this, and if people don't want to get themselves knowledgeable, they will not.  
---
Raid boss mechanics are indeed more complex in modern WoW, and the ease of retrieval of information will be the same between Classic and retail, so we're stuck at the will of the players, not at the game itself.
---
I guess for me, the feeling I get when playing on a private server is that it isn't "real" and lose the drive to play after a little bit. I don't think that'll be the case in Classic -- the game is there, it's just not the same as an authentic vanilla experience. 
---
Irregardless
---
Hurt? No it would not hurt me but I rather not have it. I'm also against updated graffics yes. But will I still play the game? Yes.
---
YOU THERE! CHECK OUT THAT NOISE!
---
AVAST YE SWABS! REPEL THE INVADO0000RZZ!
---
I played on Nost for a few months prior to its closure, and I can say from my experience it wasn't rose tinted goggles, I truly enjoyed it.  From the music to the sound effects, the quests, and the cheap shot attack sound from a rogue reminding you that contested areas suck, it brought a huge smile to my face.  Even the grind of horrible drop rates or 2 hour wailing cavern runs didn't bore me.   It was a bit of nostalgia, but also a huge amount of desire to get better and get "just one more level".   One thing I felt wasn't the desire to get to 60 as fast as possible, it was enjoying the journey of each level once again.
---
People who say balance druids are bad is an example of this. In PvP a balance Druid can put a whole team on blast with their aoe if built correctly. The problem is that some of the meme specs really are not as good as others. You can take an average mage and put their dps up against the best ret pally you know and the mage will still win hands down pressing only frost bolt in MC. So you’re right in that bad specs played badly make them seem memeable, but take the best player of a bad spec and against an average player of the upper tier dps spec they cannot compete.
---
The servers slowly coming back online, yours is always last of course, so you create a level 1 on a random realm and see tons of other people doing the same.
---
I agree, I've had many 60s go obsolete when the next big pserver was launching, but you can still get some practice in with whatever class you're going with
---
This is some of the coolest work ive seen. Jw do you do commissions? Id love to get an undead warlock done (my main for classic) to keep the hype going :)
---
The periodic table can be reduced down to 4 elements tbh
---
Also, been flipflopping between a Forsaken Priest or a Tauren Shaman for when Classic launches. This will be the "healing at 60" class. 
---
My other character will be a Warrior for dps all the way to and including 60 if that changes anything??
---
&gt; no
---
Um...wrong
---
&gt; because of this one edge case
---
Ooooookay.
---
Unfortunately, people will cheat. There are only two ways to stop it.
---
1) heavily enforce the rules (without GMs this seems hard in any capacity)   
---
2) set the system up to minimize cheating
---
Oh look number 2 happens with lack of loot trading. No loot trading.
---
I'm looking forward to watching people fall in the water and pull mobs trying to get back up, then end up wiping the party because they dragged the mobs to the rest of the group who end up getting overwhelmed.
---
Thanks man that would be awesome!
---
I aggree.
---
But if you gave Nihilium 40 chars with terribad specs, they'd still make it work somehow, because they'd try to discover the new "crowd pummeler", "wolfhsead helm" or something like that to make them viable (not awesome).
---
We can’t talk about private servers here. Which is too bad because Nost and its successors have provided the best MMORPG experience I’ve seen in the last 15 years. But yea we can’t talk about this. 
---
Trying to find 40 that knownthe fights even know is still relatively hard
---
The majority of classic players never got to raid at all, and pservers population isn’t the only ones on Classic when it drops

Who would stand inside a 1-minute cooldown hurricane tho?
---
They could just make them part of the new graphics options regarding char models and then it would disable the graphics on the "keep it classic" if you so choose to.
---
&gt; there are tons of people who haven't played vanilla since it was new, and they'll be returning too, as well as players who have never experienced it.
---
People seem to keep forgetting this, thinking only those of us who have been playing on private server are looking forward to this.
---
I know 5 people irl who are going to be atleast trying Classic none of those guys have never played on a private server.
---
Its not! 
---
only the first comparison fits.
---
everything that takes practise is hard, mechanically. like painting or properly operating a race car.  
---
becoming a lawyer is not mechanically challenging, but you need to gain a lot of knowledge over time.
---
If you're not interested in paying for a sub yet i would recommend checking out the f2p section on [xpoff.com](https://xp-off.com).
---
There is a really big community of free to play wow players there.
---
Yeaaah, I didn't see that haha!
---
You gave me a really insightfull reply though. 
---
It does make it harder for me to make a decision, but I don't think that is a bad thing.
---
Gotta make the best choice straight away, since i want to invest heavely into one character at first, maybe a second one later on.
---
Really hard to choose between these three.
---
Thank you very much!
---
They might not be playing retail is the thing. BFA has a pretty bad rep atm, which means a casual could be put off and not play. But hey, maybe Classic will be good, right? Oh wait, it's too hardcore for them...unless they expand upon the tiny changes they've already made.
---
And even then, that doesn't address my first point, in that between no changes and changes, one is a lot harder to fall down the slope with.
---
I played the game on private recently and it was all easy. I played vanilla.
---
Rule 4 Do not share or encourage the use of exploits, cheats, private servers, or other illicit game behaviour.
---
Never says you aren't allowed to talk about them, you just can't advertise specific ones or tell people they should play on private servers. You can talk about the mechanics of them as they relate to classic, including community aspects and whether or not it's a decent game. Otherwise, people would just have 15 year old memories to try and base everything on.
---
Played a few years on PS and for me at least, it definitely comes very close. It can't 100% replicate the feeling but it's definitely still a lot of fun :)
---
I think Classic will be even better though. Just something special with official servers :)
---
The thing is, you can put the world greatest players, with 15 years of research data and "make it work". But its till just OK while you have to do massive amount of EXTRA to keep it in any way competitive. The point is, if you spent the same time on a non-meme char, you would be FAR superior in what you are doing.
---
Maybe with the exception of bear tank in alliance.
---
All three will definitely be enjoyable. Push comes to shove, you're not feeling the class around level 30-40, you now have a high level alt and can catch up to that level somewhat quickly. 
---
After you create your character, I'd be surprised if you reconsidered your decision! In my experience, the anxiety of "what class should I play" usually disappears after I'm playing. 
---
What's Korean for Seduce and Nuke cheese?
---
Don’t pay me any mind I’m just farming downvoted
---
Retail too simplified? In what way? 
---
Honestly, don't worry at all about Classic wow and people being jerks. Will there be some jerks? Of course... there was back during Vanilla when it was live too. You will find people you want to play with and it will all be okay. The average player will be completely okay with grouping with you. I think if anything people tend to be a little nicer when playing Classic. Just be honest if you don't know a dungeon, etc.. You will learn fast and be fine! 
---
&gt; Let me ask you: Why do you want the exact copy of what Vanilla WoW was?
---
It's for the same reason I'll go back and re-play games like The Last of Us, or Link to the Past, or Chrono Trigger every once in a while.  I loved those games for what they were.  Many people love(d) Vanilla WoW for what it was, but because of how MMOs work, they haven't been able to (legally) go back and just re-play their favorite game.  Now they finally have that chance, and I can see how it's infuriating for people to want to change it.
---
Back to your main point, I think the idea of a "Classic+" server is not necessarily a bad idea in ~5 years or so, if the Classic community is fading away.  But they would have to be entirely new servers if they want to try and soft-reboot WoW.  There always needs to be a place for Pure Classic WoW to exist, otherwise you're just taking that game away from those people all over again.
---
I always level my shamans on pservers as Elemental.  I remember this time in Winterspring around level 57 ish.  This level 60 hunter was running by and decided to attack me, so I immediately cast a lightning bolt followed by my macro for Elemental Mastery/Chain Lightning and dropped him to about 20% health in two hits and then he ran away as my next lightning bolt chased after him lol.  
---
I always saved my EM for pvp encounters (I always play on pvp servers).  I could always just imagine the panic on people's faces after I nearly two shot them in world pvp while leveling.
---
If you want to dps as enhancement, take it upon yourself to get a Nightfall Axe and that could be your way into raids.  You could be that guy.
---
I mean you're going a little extreme here. A balance between pugs and friend/guild runs are great. Pugs have their place
---

---
Holy shit lawyers can collude at all? What the literal fuck.
---
Don't worry about the old heads most of us have forgotten as much as we remember, I would say be more concerned with the pserver elitists, but the will be such a small drop in the bucket I wouldn't worry about them either.
---
Attack speed doesn't change DPS unless you have the Frenzy talent since your pet will have better Frenzy uptime if it attacks faster. But that talent isn't available until level 35+.
---
That's an interesting and very valid argument against toggles for models/animations. It would indeed increase the install size of the client.
---
Exactly agree.
---
People suck. The system will absolutely be gamed. Dont make a system that is easily gamable, problem solved.
---
Oh look, there wasnt a problem to beg in. If it aint broke dont fix it.
---
Why implement a non-authentic feature aimed at "solving" an issue that &lt;0.01% of players will have which will then negatively effect &gt;90% of all other player's experience? (by killing trust in pug dungeon runs, disincentivizing playing with strangers, etc)
---
I've played on like vanilla 8+ pservers over the last 5 or 6 years. yes the magic is still there
---
The only thing anyone has learned from you is that you are a massive tool.
---
Indeed. There's no guarantee the stated goal of authenticity will be met.
---
The real irony here is that your comment currently sits at -3 karma
---
Private servers are 95% there. Anyone who says otherwise is an elitist. I’ve been playing them for 12+ years.  The other 5% you would never know. 
---
The last 4 years we have had really really good servers though.
---
Sure there are some changes, since we don’t know all the info from Vanilla. But nothing ground breaking to an adventurer / intro raider. 
---
I did not go into your first argument on purpose. Because it is like saying "allowing for gay marriage is a slippery slope to allowing for marrying an animal". It is just a stance I do not agree with at all.
---
Your point about BFA and casuals possible looking for a better MMO to play has something to it though. But if we get to the point where Blizzard looses the casual crowd with BFA and classic could capture the market again, then we are fucked anyways.
---
No because in Vanilla dropping a totem used a global cooldown, so you could only drop one at a time.
---
Macros may work the same but the game mechanics don't.
---
A valid argument. Unfortunately for you, the vast majority of the WoW playing community are Retail WoW players and they're the majority voice.
---
And they want Retail WoW models/animations over the Classic art.
---
*targets you* 
---
*casts chain lightning* 
---
"heh, nothin' personal kid"
---
How could the game be ruined by "oldheads" when the game was made by "oldheads" for "oldheads" and revived for "oldheads". If anything I worry new players are going to ruin the community. 
---
Meh...I don't care either way.  It doesn't bother me.  Put it in or don't Blizzard, I'll still play Classic.
---
Unzip dick
---
So I’ve asked this before. 
---
Keyboard turning? That’s bad? Like how else am I supposed to play other than WASD?
---
And clicking abilities? Why would I put something on a hot key that I use maybe once every three minutes? 
---
As a raiding PvE mage, I feel like the difference between using macros and hot keys for everything and just spamming FB with a few mouse keybinds for important shit would be minimal. 
---
Maybe a 1% difference. Certainly nothing to worry about. 
---
I’m sure for other classes like rogues it’s more important. But for ranged? Seems fine. 
---
Sure, I disagree with that particular slippery slope too. Not every slippery slope comes to pass. But if you definitely 100% don't want the slippery slope to happen, the only guaranteed way is to cut it off before it starts.
---
How about you stop being stupid advocating to add someone to "fix" an issue that happens less than 0.01% of the time, but which will negatively impact the experience of &gt;90% of all other players, discouraging playing in PuG dungeon runs, discouraging grouping with strangers, etc.
---
If there is Master Loot on, then let there be loot trading (arguably acceptable but still has the same issues). Otherwise, if you screw up your loot, then you have to live with your mistake, no writing tickets.
---
Why is this still so hard to understand?
---
This I understand, but I mean, doe the Rake have more dmg per hit then a Mountain Lion? If so, More Dmg per hit + equal attack speed = More DPS.
---
it was new.. all my friends were slowly getting the game so i just sold it to them instead.. 
---
i didnt make the chars to sell, i sold the first two because i didnt get hooked on the game. 
---
Classic WoW is amazing and always will be, no amount of time can change that imo. It's a completely timeless masterpiece. 
---
Always been a sucker for this kind of staff. Well done, man!
---
If you're taking requests, how about Duskwood/a Stitches rampage?
---
Yes, it's a good game. I only got to level 30 or so back in classic, and played retail in every xpac except BFA. I'd prefer to play classic over any other expansion after leveling a few characters on private servers.
---
1) World continuity. This is something no xpac has done correctly, because it is very hard. Cata *could* have, but adding flying mounts and new zones just to fit with the previous 2 expansions really threw that in the can. You need to go to areas again and again at different levels, constantly traveling with quests that take you all over the map, and come back to those places later. It's not "I'll be in this zone for 10 levels, and then leave forever". Everything has a good flow, and from a story perspective it's much more engaging to have a world that was very clearly designed to fit together.
---
2) Better community. You *need* guilds and friends to make groups, as there's no LFG, dungeons are long, you actually need to run to them, and they're actually hard. Plus, open quests out in the world are actually hard, and you need groups for a lot of them as well. It actually sparks engagement with other players, instead of letting you steamroll content solo.
---
3) Classes feel unique. You are really limited on each class, but that makes you feel really strong about what you *can* do. Not everyone has AoE, or good AoE. Not everyone has a DoT, or a good DoT. For example, druids only rez is on a 30 min CD with a reagent. Sucks, right? BUT, it's the only reactive battle rez in the game. They are different from every other healer, but it's not objectively better or worse.
---
Tl,dr; It's a good game. If you like wow and/or MMORPGs, you will like classic.
---
For non-hard progression you can run with talents in elemental and resto trees. You loose mana tide totem and some healing power but you gain faster and better casting. Ele/resto is good for pretty much anything so you don't have to respec and you can have one shaman... the downside is that the lightning bolt is nature damage so you won't be able to use it on some mobs in the open world as well as you won't be efficient on boss fights. Some go enhancement and if they have Nightfall Axe they are more welcomed in raid than without it (but still drop totems or else). Some raid mechanics related to mana bar (like on Rag) make melee Enhancement to be a problem ;)
---
On the undocumented vanilla I have two shamans - one leveled on old realm and one on fresh which is the played one. Herbalism/alchemy/fishing and money flows (altough I don't PvP at all). But for Classic I'm thinking mage + shaman or mage + druid where mage is first/main and the alt is also subsequently leveled to 60. Kind of farming mobs around the world is the fun I want to get...where as I don't respec the shaman from resto as like the mobs that drop greater nature protection potion recipe are quite nature resistant not to mention elements that drop elemental earth for the pots.

---
I played on a few pservers. And for me it recreated that old feeling. It was an even better feeling at that because now I have a clue what I’m doing, in contrast to 13-year old me. It’s a compelling world and skill-system which a I have yet to find in another MMO.
---
I don't remember when it was implemented, but what about when only classes who can use an item can roll on it? Would that not greatly reduce the chance/ incentive of ninja looting and trading to friends? 
---
I agree with him tbh about it being too simple. The game is so easy. I don't think I have ever gotten close to dying this xpack when I am out in the world. It should feel dangerous. This is the feeling I am looking for in Classic. That is what made the game fun for me back in the day. It was a challenge.
---
I feel that.  A lot of people complained about the drama of nost, and there were all the usual private server bug/lag issues, but the only thing that I didn't like about it was knowing that eventually, without any warning at all, it would probably just vanish.
---
I can't wait to play classic without that concern.
---
Haha love the trolls who couldn’t get it done in game so try hard to mess with anyone they can on the forums. That’s about as pathetic as it gets. Have fun on the forums while the rest of us enjoy the game! 
---
I'm looking forward actually completing a whole dire maul runs and kill prince 😍
---
No. All pets of the same family (cat, owl, boar, etc) do the same damage, though there are rare cases where a beast has a mana bar and when tamed it will have inferior caster-oriented stats.
---
A severe and controversial case of ninja’ing hit a server last night that has basically ended he viability of the perpetrator’s toon (gkicked, named and shamed, all of the server knows about it). Seems like the perp had some level of regret after and mentioned if there were loot trading he could have fixed this and given the item back to its rightful winner.
---
Thanks, that's useful info.
---
That is a really good point. At the same time, MMOs are not static games, like "traditional" games are. Vanilla WoW also changed throughout its time and developed. So one could argue, it developing further would stay true to its history and what it was. I'd also argue that there are some blatant design flaws in vanilla that could be fixed for a better experience.
---
Anyways, any major changes that we'd call classic+ (e.g. with new content) should definitely not be a thing before a certain time has passed.
---
AV alliance bridge. Back when AV took all day and it was glorious.
---
Just wait for a few days after classic launches and see if everything is the way they promised before you buy game time. Easy peasy
---
I've been playing on pservers on and off for a very long time (around 10 years I guess). First of all, not all spells and quests work correctly, some mobs might miss abilities, have wrong stats, incorrect drop rates etc... even though it's gotten much better over time. I experiment with different classes, races and specs, which makes things interesting enough for me. There's also a very dark side of pservers, not just their legal status, but also data breaches, unexpected closings, crashes, botters, hackers, multiboxers, population issues etc.
---
Despite all of that some pservers provide good enough experience and I personally enjoy playing WoW on them. I like pacing, look&amp;feel of original zones, characters of classes, interactions with other players etc. I'm not sure what else to say. Of course, pservers won't reproduce real vanilla experience, but Classic won't do that either.
---
It will be a breeze since all the mobs will be dead because of saturation
---
Happened to me a few times. Especially earlier in expansions when 5 man loot mattered
---
Ah yes, the original ENOUGH boss, but not in a lame way because you still killed his ass at the end of the encounter. 
---
You have it in reverse, the worse the player, the more likely he is to play an optimized build. All the balance druids and enhancement shamans were above average.
---
The more a player obsesses about BiS, optimal specs and guides, the more i assume he's terrible and needs someone holding his hand.
---
Whoa thanks, I'll look those videos up! Big thanks!
---
Yea, I understand your point but I guess I was just wondering what he meant. The game is still more complex in many ways in retail. Classes have way more abilities there is more to do, etc.. Don't get me wrong I am excited for Classic and will only be playing classic but the game is more simple in many ways in Classic and that is what I like about it.
---
Lmao fucking vile. 10/10
---
Between Sekiro, cyberpunk 2077, and classic wow I don't know what to be hyped for anymore; and I'm frustrated because I know I'll barely have the time to play any of them.
---
I haven't been this hyped for a video game since... skyrim maybe? And now there's 3 that look insane.
---
something that was soooo cool to me was in cata when they changed WPL back to lordaeron, like we purged the scourge.
---
The "preservation project" idea has been thrown around a lot without any backing. Where did Blizzard ever say they aren't going to change things going forward?
---
&gt;  So one could argue, it developing further would stay true to its history and what it was. I'd also argue that there are some blatant design flaws in vanilla that could be fixed for a better experience.
---
I think that's a fair argument to make.  But the point stands that if we start iterating on it, even if the changes are almost universally agreed to be *good* ones, then after one, two, maybe three years of changes, it's going to be a different game than the one people know and love.
---
In the case of most MMOs, I think people would agree that change is about the only constant.  But in WoW's case, it's something special.  It was a landmark title, and it's the kind of game that 100 years from now when people are discussing notable releases that shaped the gaming industry it will almost certainly be a major talking point.  To that end, there is value to be had in preserving it exactly as it was.
---
For some, Classic WoW will be a wonderful game that holds up after 15 years.  For others, Classic is going to be a fun jaunt into nostalgia.  For others, and arguably for the gaming industry as a whole, Classic WoW is going to be a Museum Artifact meant to immortalize an important piece of gaming history.  There is value in all three of those, but you only get any of them if you don't change the game.
---
3-5 years from now, I would probably be hype as hell for a fresh launch of Classic+ Servers, featuring a Vanilla-like design philosophy to new content like Karazhan, Hyjal, Grim Batol, etc.  I think there's a lot of opportunity there for Blizzard to basically revitalize the game and launch a whole new MMO that caters to an entirely different audience from retail.
---
AAAAADS FIRST!!!! 
---
Yes, this COULD happen in THEORY.  But, seriously applied logic says that Ironfoe is not even that good for hunter.  What hunter is going to be meleeing that much to make use of it?  
---
I know you're trying to make a "what if" worst case scenario but it actually comes off as ridiculous.
---
Hypothetical scenarios only work if they are actually believable. I know the old meme/joke that hunters roll on everything but honestly this just seems like overkill.  It's not even believable because it's so ridiculous to believe that a person playing a 15 year old re-release who PROBABLY already has a "BiS" spreadsheet made out, would need/abuse a loot trading system just to screw over someone else who could use it (like the warrior, or rogue, or shaman).
---
Hold down your right mousebutton and turn with your mouse. No, it's significantly more than 1%.
---
Nein changes!
---
But that particular slippery slope argument is not that different from the one that occurs here. "We cannot be sure that one change leads to another, so we will not allow for any changes." Of course it will be difficult to distinguish between good and bad changes, but the more we discuss them constructively, the higher the chances that only good changes will happen. Not talking about it increases the chances of the wrong things happening.
---
To take a "real-world" analogy: US-States that teach abstinence only about sexual behavior are the ones with the highest teen pregnancies. So by that logic, talking about "no changes" only will lead to more/worse changes. Although I started this particular argument a bit tongue in cheek ... Thinking about it, it does make kind of sense. If we do not talk constructively, we do not know why certain changes are actually bad because it is always assumed that all changes are bad.
---
U need?
---
If Classic+ came out, "Classic Classic" servers would die instantly.
---
No more likely the mage wins and whispers the rogue 300g and you can have it.
---
I didn't get to see end of AQ in vanilla, and none of naxx. I'd be thrilled to see those for the "first" time (because of course i went there eventualy as a level ~5 million). 
---
Just thinking about all the starting zones makes me think of the magic and gives me goosebumps. I can't wait to get to play this game again.
---
As for friends. I made most of mine through playing the game anyway, because what do you know... other people are playing the game too and the content brings us together.
---
The mass zerg to Blasted Lands or Azshara after someone's scouting alt saw Azuregos or Kazzak spawn was great. Mad rush to see who can pull together a raid &amp; get on site ASAP.   
---
Best Kazzak kill was getting a phone call from my buddy at 6 AM that we were throwing together a raid for him. We managed to drop him &amp; my buddy win the Blacklight Bracers with just enough time to them rush out the door and catch the bus to high school.
---
*deep breath* REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Maybe, maybe not.  But the important thing is that they would still be there for people to play if they wanted, and no one would have anything to complain about.
---
Found the Rogue. 
---
popularity of the bigger pservers proves its not just rose tinted goggles
---
I was sad that I joined it literally a few weeks before it was announced to be shut down. I only got my Hunter to like level 18 :(
---
Does exalted include the 60% mount?
---
True, I just don't see them dedicating the resources to it. It is a safe fallback for them in the event they actually do make a change that people hate I suppose.
---
They didn't exactly say it but it would monumentally stupid if it weren't that way. I think Blizzard didn't say it because they thought it is obvious. :P
---
Vanilla wasn't available because it was changed into TBC, then Wrath, etc. A lot of people petitioned them to bring back Vanilla until they realized it would be a good idea. If they change it *again*, what then? Shall we petition them to bring back Vanilla *again*? it's asinine.
---
I haven't been active in WoW since early WoTLK, as I did not like the way it was headed after first subbing around a month after initial release. Furthermore I didn't utilise pserv's as for me it did not replicate the game that I loved.
---
A number of my irl friends have either; stopped the same sort of time as me, continued playing through various xpac's, or even still subbing for BfA.
---
However - I have spoken to all of them and every last one will be rolling in classic (and those still subbed expect it to be the majority of their gaming time), and all for the same reason - the community. I've seen this aspect listed in a number of posts both on here, official forums and YouTube videos of people giving their reasons for "rolling the clock back". 
---
Even more so, every 'release hype' related post from a vanilla expat I've seen is about the immersive community there used to be, the fact you needed to group up for certain tasks that could lead to regularly grouping with these people that until that fateful day, you had no idea who they were.
---
I'm not saying it will be exactly as it used to be in terms of community, but I suspect it will not be far off. Heck, back in the day there were people who just didn't want to know/made snarky remarks regardless, but you're going to get that in any walk of life!
---
downvoted, boooyah
---
I think you can, in part, self-select yourself into a server that has less private server players that know the game backwards/forwards per capita. I'll be playing on an RP PVE realm to accomplish this.
---
It’s not!
---
&gt;I think most normal people would turn it into a funny story or a lesson learned but you can't please these entitled instant gratification kids.
---
I don't care either way on the topic (I fail to see it as that big a deal), but your quote can easily be applied to the "victims" of loot trading just as well ))
---
The whole 1-60 guide is a separate text document so it should readily translate. The maps are a full set of map graphics with locations and key names overlaid on it. 
---
There's been tons of talk about why sharding or loot trading, for example, is bad. It's already been discussed to death. The only remaining stances are either "no changes" or "we have to trust Blizz to know when to stop/we have to trust people to not be assholes". Given Blizz's track record with the game over the years, and given human nature, I know what side I'd be picking.
---
Staff of Jordan when I was level 39 and in desperate need of gold for my mount... sold it for 400g and was overjoyed. 
---
I don't think it'd be stupid if it wasn't that way. OSRS is a proven example of how you can take an old MMO and improve it further - #nochangers existed on there, the game died and they revived it with updates. There's no clamoring for the original version back (again).
---
&gt;Yeah, because this was such an issue when it was introduced.
---
Retail WoW also had proper (and forced) need before greed in pugs.
---
I've never understood the argument by Blizz that it prevents ninja looting. I might just not understand it properly. 
---
In the old system an item would drop, someone would roll need on it when they didn't actually need it, they won the roll, and they ninja the item. 
---
With loot trading the item will drop, someone will roll need on it when they don't actually need it, they win the roll, and they ninja the item...
---
How is that any different from the old system? The only difference now is that the ninja has a chance to redeem himself and trade it to someone who deserves it. But we're talking about a ninja here. Why would they all of a sudden be remorseful? 
---
Now to combat ninjas everyone in the group has to roll need, thus completely eliminating the entire purpose of the loot system. 
---
There are still going to be ninjas with a loot trading system. They will just be slightly less successful if everyone agrees to throw the built-in loot system out the window. 
---
Yeah, the resources are the hard part, because at that point they'd be maintaining Retail WoW, the Classic+ branch of WoW, and still supporting legacy servers to boot.  Realistically I see us just getting TBC servers if Classic is a success and there's enough demand for them.
---
Yes and no. Certain aspects of private servers are very different. For example the uberservers make questing feel far worse than it was, give an unrealistic view of how easy it is to form groups, and the sheer size makes community and reputation far less important.
---
That being said, even with those issues private servers show that the core game itself is still an excellent game worth Blizzard officially supporting and us playing.
---
Wow I just wrote a comment about how I found Staff of Jordan in lvl 39 as well
---
&gt;I can just imagine getting whispers from people asking "NEED???" when i finally get an item, wanting me to trade it to them. That's not what vanilla is about, that shit should stay in retail.
---
Bro personal loot is not going to be in vanilla. This is a problem exclusive to personal loot.
---
Playing by yourself? Warlock
---
Playing with a group? (World or bg) then mage.
---
Watching what someone like Ohgee can do as a mage in pvp is nuts, no warlock can compete with that 
---
We'll have to see.
---
We are without a doubt getting loot trading. The new blizzard is all about the $$$, and they just cut hundreds of support staff. Not saying I want it, just saying its coming
---
I think that it's not so much that the server isn't real and more it's "well this will be fun until there's some mod drama or legal drama or some Chinese decide to DDoS my server."
---
For me, I hope not.
---
Quit wow in 2006 after AQ, quit gaming and focused on real life with the exception of the occasional game of Dota 2.
---
Installed a private server in November 2018, hit 60 over Christmas.  WoW is an exceptionally well made game, I am now raiding two days a week and have killed Cthun.
---
The private server experience is a very different experience to retail although the gameplay is of course the same.
---
The private server meta, the increased server population and the increased knowledge make it a very different experience
---
This close to classic I would not invest too much time into a private server - use it to level some classes to 15-20 to get a feel for them, but leave it there
---
I do!
---
Or just allow the system in ML because ML is already almost exclusively used by organized pre-made groups anyway. You already put yourself at the ML's whim.
---
Hahaha that’s the best advice to give 
---
Thanks, i hate it.

They're obligated to reply to every support ticket, and that adds up over time even if they're an open and shut case.
---
My experience with Pservers:
---
Playing the game with the hope of experiencing it the same way I did when it first came out, but being extremely disappointed by the differences. The majority of the people are different; often the servers I’ve played on are dominated by different languages. The play is different; I’ve seen everything from unresolved bugs to bad scripts to plussed up experience or gold gains. My general feeling is that of wasting time because I never know when Blizzard will come and shut that particular server down, or when (finally) Blizzard will release Classic, so I don’t take it seriously, I don’t take the time to level my professions, I don’t take time to grind gold or items or gear, etc. All in all, for me, a pserver is good for a quick WoW fix when I feel like I need it, but is no replacement for the real, Blizzard supported thing.
---
I don't see why not.
---
I also don't see why.
---
There's a ton of tweaks that could be made, but the accumulation of all those tweaks are what turn software projects into death marches. I'd rather they just ship the damn game.
---
How is it exclusive to personal loot? If 3 of us need an item, and i win it, and I can trade that item, people will ask for it?
---
Gear score and raider.io ewww. so many high io score people playing like monkeys. Useless.
---
Well, back in the day it was universally agreed that the new design of quest-hubs that was introduced with TBC was good. It was also universally agreed that the dungeon browser, which was introduced with WOTLK, was good. But now we are smarter, having experienced those changes and what they did. So we are wiser when it comes to future changes. But none of these changes fixed any design flaws, they are actual changes in design.
---
I am a proponent of a classic wow, that is vanilla without its most blatant flaws. And I would definitely play a classic+ with new content down the road ... whether or not they are different servers is of little consequence to me.
---
I finally caved a few months back and am happy to report that yes vanilla is a genuinely awesome game and yes it's possible to recapture a lot of the magic from 15 years ago. The increased difficulty necessitates coordination and socializing both out in the world and in dungeons, and stuff like talent points, the infrequency of awesome gear and the major differences between classes really do make the whole thing feel more like an RPG than current WoW (which I don't "hate" but am also not playing anymore). 
---
I should also add that I frequently rolled my eyes when people here and elsewhere would wax philosophical about the glory of the vanilla community... but I was wrong. For the most part, it's a great crowd. People are much more patient and helpful - right down to level 60s handing out wands and money to fresh shitters in Razor Hill and Goldshire. The whole experience makes me very, very excited for Classic - particularly the amount of people I've encountered who never played vanilla and who have no idea what they're doing. I think we're going to be getting more new blood than I first anticipated.
---
PS are alright to play but never felt as good as they should. It's not even the performance (which is mostly great) or the players. It's more like a loaming feeling in the background. There is so much drama and corruption around the PS. Paid bots, chinaframer who farm gold for the server owners and of course the swing sword over your head, that the server could always close anytime. I realy enjoyed my stay on different PS and I know I will love the pure classic experience on the official ones.
---
It only overheals on the primary target and that's the only target it should ever overheal on.  The REASON people like chain heal is because it's the only smart heal in vanilla.  It's bounces should almost never overheal anyone, and to be honest; your primary target shouldn't be the tank, it should be the melee DPS.
---
As a casual player, I always leveled Shamans, 
---
all i know for sure is, a well prepared shaman is hard to kill in wpvp, earthbind and ghost wolf do the trick almost always
---
realize if u gonna fight back is in your hands, there is a totem to fight back any class
---
In raids they call u mostly for the totens and secondary heals, there is better classes to main heal or become a top dps (it's possible, but is hard to happen), but heal in parties is sublime, u can heal everyone with chain heal, give big heals to main tank after a big aggro and if everything goes wrong, just keep calm and find a safe place to die, then reincarnate and save the run (inform the other member u have reincarnate, so they don't freak out and run to unreachable places to die, happens a lot).
---
Shamans is a support rule, so is hard to be the top dps, or the top healer, but all top dps and top healers have a supporting shaman =\] 
---
Here is some classic specs

Are you high? Everything you just said is literally the opposite of the truth. "It's only really bad for BoEs"?? You could already trade BoEs that's the whole point of them, what the fuck lmao
---
you are getting downvoted by Esfand twitch bots
---
Imagine being so out of touch you have to actually make shit up that wasn't said. They never said or even implied anything like what you are claiming.
---
Having tried it over the past year or so, I can confidently say that it's a genuinely great game. The experience is just completely different than WotLK (which I also tried again, and was disappointed by) and onward.
---
The best way to describe the difference is that in WotLK I would shut down my brain and blindly repeat the same patterns over and over. While in vanilla I am constantly engaged in thinking, planning and executing.
---
Agreed! I expect when I'm first on again there will be a number of revelations amongst my patchy memory that will be followed by "how did I forget that?!"
---
But "no changes" or "we have to trust Blizz" are just the two extremes to the discussion. There is always a middle ground.
---
The only correct arguments to those two examples are: "(no) sharding because ..." and "(no) loot trading because ..." Depending on whether you are an opponent or proponent of these changes. Since these changes were/are on the table specifically, we have discussed them and are wiser to why they should or should not be in classic.
---
Yeah. You dig deep enough on that god forsaken Murloc shore and you could probably find a few femurs from my vanilla Pally. That place is death.
---
So the thing is that most people weren't aware of this, and no one would wait in queue 3-4 days to transfer a blue drop from a non level 60 dungeon. Very few people would do this for a max level dungeon either, because it'd be faster to just run the dungeon again a few times.
---
The discussion has happened already though. There is no middle ground between "not having something" and "having something".
---
Just remembered leveling in Blasted Lands and getting one shot, then looking behind me to see Teremus coasting by...
---
I'm only on 4 so far, but I'll get there.
---
Old head here, been playing since original Classic. I, frankly, don’t have time to be an elite, full time WoW player and will be a casual right along side of you. Although I know there are many my age still living in mom’s basement that have been awaiting this day like a doomsday preppier awaits the apocalypse, I have a feeling that still many more, like myself, have lives to less outside the game with families and jobs, etc. That said, I understand that there will be many new players that weren’t old enough to click a mouse when Classic was live the first time around and I understand that some will have questions and require guidance. I don’t personally have any issue with helping anyone, I remember the help I needed when I first started. As for the elites who will shame you for asking a simple question, relish in the fact that their avatar, as impressive as it might be, is likely the best thing that they have in their sad, wasted lives! Just move on to someone who is willing to assist!
---
I absolutely get that and agree, but like I said in that post: I always duo with my wife (she plays a warrior and/or mage), and I always farm up all the goodies from SM (so I get Mograines instead of ravager).  In other words: I like going Verigan's-&gt;Mograine's rather than Verigan's-&gt;ravager because I'm playing a pally that isn't the primary source of it's own damage.  Plus, despite the fast swing speed, Mograine's is actually higher dps than Ravager.
---
All I'm trying to say is there are situations where it isn't the best choice specifically because of the other weapons available just before and just after it.   
---
Dude I was trying to tell you it's not normal for an experienced player to die "a shit ton" on a pre lvl 40 warrior (unless we are speaking of PVP of course).
---
You might have a too aggressive play-style.   
---
Frankly leveling is the easiest part of being a warrior. Farming or PVP wise you will need countless dungeons and raid runs to be able to do what a full green hunter can do when he reaches lvl 60.  
---
This is the only reason I might not roll a warrior in classic : if you can't invest the time to get massively geared, you "suck ass".  
---
Everybody speaks of pre-raid bis whatever here, like you just have to run a couple dungeons here and there to be fully decked out. They fail to realize that some of this gear will never drop for you no matter how many runs you do.  
---
People know their classes a lot more now than they did in Vanilla. Wouldn't be surprised if the crap specs from back then perform better now and people cry that blizzard made changes 
---
What is the artists medium?  It's like digital design mixed with water colors.  Totally badass.
---
I think the nostalgia argument has already been debunked. The players on the private server Nostalrius took a poll and a huge chunk of players had never played Vanilla before until then. So it was new for them and they liked the game. I was in this camp when I first played private servers in 2012. 
---
It's a good game (not perfect) that has a lot of content and is just very different from the current game. 
---
To be brief, because I'm sure people can write entire dissertations about what they like about vanilla, I'll list off a few things:
---
1. Feeling of progression, both in character power and socially. You start off really weak, killing stuff slowly and you're a nobody. The word is hostile. And you are required to group up with people to accomplish a lot of things. So you really feel your power grow as you level, and you meet lots of people while you level and it becomes a social experience and you can build a reputation by how nice a player and how skilled a player you are. 
---
2. Gear feels good and you can feel its impact, especially at 60. One problem I have with the game in later expansions is not just that the numbers get huge, but that an upgraded piece of gear isn't hugely noticeable. Yeah if you really watch the dps meter maybe you'll notice a tiny boost. But in classic that upgrade is noticeable, especially if you're leveling and you, as a warrior, replace your old, garbage weapon with a big, powerful axe. It's a very satisfying feeling. Also gear doesn't upgrade in direct upgrades and improvements in the same stats and ilvl, it's all a bit more open range and makes the gear all feel like it has more variety to it.
---
3. Impact on a group. Even in a 5 man dungeon, it feels great to play a class that has impact and helps the group. The game in later expansions loses the uniqueness of each class to a large extent and you just need 3 dps of any description and let's go. But in a 5 man dungeon in vanilla, say, Scarlet Monastery, you really want that mage because he brings polymorph and food/water for the group. You really want that shaman because he brings windfury totem. And the paladin for his blessings. You can see your class choice pay off for the players around you in real time. 
---
But there are cons, like the game in solo play can be really repetitive, and there aren't really spell rotations for most classes because they use only 1 or 2 buttons in raids. Grinding is the most efficient way of leveling (thus perpetuating the repetitive solo play). But I'll still play it and have a good time. I'd argue it's an overall better game than BfA, but I'm not ignoring the flaws either.
---
And yeah. Just wait for the actual release to play the game. No point in burning out playing the game now when you will start again from scratch in 4 months. Also playing on a PvE or PvE-RP server is a great way to avoid the private server bros who have the game mapped out and enjoy "enlightening" people who just want to play the game and learn it on their own.
---
Don't see why they just don't implement it and instead allow for a system whereby if the act of ninja looting was intentional then the members of the group could simply click a button that records the when, where, and who, to be reviewed by a bot if necessary, resulting in the offending party receiving a ban for x number of weeks. Two strikes and your account is banned. Call it a ninja reporting system and automate the whole thing 
---
that's me when I'm out questing and I hear the rogue stealth sound
---
Keep in mind that it'll probably be at least a bit more casual than private servers. You need to be at least somewhat invested in the game to play a bootleg version of it. I think there'll be some elitism, but it might not be as bad as you think.
---
I really have no idea how to express this, but i feel like its simplified in some ways, and annoyingly tedious in others.
---
Having to grind gear for small chances at warforges, etc is just tedious and annoying.  Youre on a constant treadmill and it just gets exhausting/boring.  Sometimes i miss just having a set of gear that i knew was going to be as high as i was going to get, and that was that.  
---
The same kind of goes with artifact power.  The returns end up being pretty small, and even if i dont actively grind it, im always at least tempted to do some missions/emissaries/whatever to get a bit of it.  Its also INCREDIBLY annoying for people that like to play alts.  Getting a nice piece of gear for 3 slots now feels like shit because you dont have the AP to unlock the traits.
---
-----
---
On the other hand, Classic is obviously slower.  Less loot drops in raids, it takes much longer to level (to me thats actually probably an advantage.  I love leveling, but dont feel like i get anything out of it on Live), mobs dont fall over when you look at them, etc.  Theres a grind, but it just doesnt feel as tedious.  
---
For example, leveling is slower, but every level you get something.  New ranks of skills every couple levels, a talent point every level, maybe a blue BoE you got lucky and looted, but couldnt equip yet.  Eventually mail/plate wearers get to start upgrading from leather/mail to mail/plate, which always felt kind of good.  As a melee seeing your armor value start to go up just feels good at that point....and im speaking as someone that started in Wrath.
---
Dungeons also have such a reputation of being hard, and you cant just faceroll through them, yet M+ on Live is that way to an annoying point where you often have to know every little thing that every mob does in every damn pull, and it just gets really old (imo).  Its exhausting for me (i have a bad memory), whereas from what i remember in Wrath (yeah yeah, i know things were easier then) there were specific mobs you had to keep an eye out for, but overall it was moreso about tracking those few things instead of the ability of every damn thing in the dungeon.
---
Of course then theres also the timers on M+, whereas in Classic if you want to take it a bit slow and steady in a group, you can.
---
Oh man, forgot about the early morning WoW before school lmao
---
No we will just be warrior druid Hunter rogue. Enough overlap to game the system when it counts.
---
You're 100% right in  terms of bringing our little spat together to make a clear point. I usually ran deep holy when I wouldn't forget to respec but OP was asking about solo life &amp; farming and I really believe 25/26/0 paladins can heal any raid if needed and can do any solo content. 
---
Deep holy is much better for healing, but if you're a good guildmate and don't mind dropping money on consumes then imo your healing won't suffer much at all from it and you certainly won't be getting carried.
---
Without DM I say 100% go deep holy because the gear from DM is obviously just insane. Obviously the helm and bracers are one thing, but duel mind tap talismans is such a game changer for mana.
---
Hunters can’t use maces.
---
If you press need on it, you clearly explicitly need it. You won't get people asking "NEED???". That's making up imaginary problems.
---
At most you might end up having some annoying person claim they get a bigger upgrade but that also seems very unlikely considering those morons you meet in LFR won't even reach level 60 in vanilla.
---
Better yet, go actively out of your way to NOT interact with these people. If pservers are anything to go by, these people live off of being considered the elitist bully.
---
"immune" "immune" "immune" "immune"
---
/giggle
---
And the tragedy would be all the more real. 
---
Imagine making your own group with friends 
---
They all pass and you just have to greed it 
---
Socializing is hard yo
---
Shadow Priest.
---
Nah. Loot trading isn't a necessity to make the servers work in the long run, unlike say sharding.
---
Keyboard turning and clicking are objectively sub-optimal ways to play the game, but I agree in most PvE content it will barely make a difference. But it does make a difference. Your reactions times to "don't stand in bad", and casting important spells will be better if you mouse turn and use keybinds. That doesn't mean you have to play that way; just don't be surprised if people shit on you for it. 
---
PvP is where that optimization is way more important. Timing and quick movement make all of the difference in a fight. That 1% increase might make the difference between you getting your counterspell off in time, or dying. 
---
Probably not. The ones that are going to be elitist tools were probably elitist tools in vanilla too. The ones that were nice in vanilla will probably still be nice now. 
---
Yes.
---
This right here.  They really dropped the ball on continuity, ever since BC.  I can get why some bad calls were made at the time, but they seemingly doubled down on them expansion after expansion.  
---
The game has always had an issue with leveling versus end-game, and when the leveling experience got worse, it started a feedback loop of people complaining about leveling, so things go changed for the worse, so people complained more about leveling.  
---
The big things they should have focused on were NOT gutting the old world during cataclysm, setting it up so that you could create a character and start any expansion, and you could complete the content for that expansion to resolve the story.  That way you were constantly engaged even if you were taking your time.
---
It’s more or less the same principle that went with people complaining about zones you out leveled too quick, but apply that to an entire expansion.  
---
Mind blowing nostalgia at first and then in died down and I realized it’s just a game I can enjoy the experience of leveling while retail I could not
---
AVASSSSST YE SWABS!!!!!
---
People are more concerned about the loot trading that nobody knows happened. Not the open-shut ninja cases.
---
But there is a middle ground between "no changes" and "let them just do what they want". And those are the two extremes I read from your last post. I'd call that middle ground "controlled changes". Picking apart any prospective change and dissecting their pros and cons to the last would constitute this middle ground. Blizzard can then use the collected arguments to make their decision. Because they will be the ones making the decision, not us.
---
Basically, anyone who is in favor of classic WoW without bad changes should participate in the discussions constructively. And just yelling #nochanges is not constructive and does not give any insight.
---
The community is filled with gamers, gamers game systems, that's what they do. Loot sharing is no exception. It has nothing to do with "this community" and everything to do with being human.
---
Thanks for understanding my point though, I do know people like my post. Glad it got so much hate hopefully my point gets illustrated and idgaf about karma.
---
1. In pvp overall, they are great. Not a master of anything, but invaluable to horde with purge, cleansing totem, tremor totem, and reliable heals + interrupts. 1v1 a shaman can spec to beat almost any class with equal gear, but they are one of the classes that absolutely wants better gear, compared to say rogues or hunters or warlocks that can function very well in pvp despite lacking in some gear. 1v2 would be very challenging for anything except Elem, and as Enh, you can really only hope for an insane WF proc to put that 1v2 to 1v1. Reason is- you don't have amazing sustain damage without hard casts, and you can't rely on that in 1v2. Susceptible to interrupts and being kited, mainly, and a lack of hard CC makes outnumbered very hard.
---
2. Healing, kind of purely at this point. Shamans have good heals but Horde doesn't have amazing options - Priest tier 1 - Shaman tier 2  - Druid tier 2.5? ranking wise, not gear stats.
---
3.  Dps compared to mage is massive, until- I imagine- much, much later on with ZG cushioning gear sets and BWL, but even then an Elem shaman will never compete with mage in pure DPS trials. This has no effect on the quality of their pvp however, strictly pve sense.
---
4. Absolutely, but mana issues are rampant from the very beginning of leveling. You'll be totem + auto attacking a lot, and shock's aren't mana friendly either aside from flame shock. You have ghost wolf for some good mobility in the lower levels, and frost shock is some S Grade soft-cc. World PvP should feel pretty good vs most classes except those that either/and see you coming + kite. Hunters, mages, warlocks, all can be very problematic if not dealt with swiftly.
---
5. For sure. Shaman's have some of the higher skill caps despite people meme Frost Shocking. A noob can Frost Shock + Wind Fury all day with some success, but a pro is going to be baiting out polymorph's with grounding totems, rank 1 earth shocking heals, fire nova totem'ing out a stealthed rogue, earth bind range locking warriors from intercepting and frost shock range locking hunters from auto shot. Insta purging PW:S, warlock sacrifice bubble, and heal over time effects. Flame shocking rogues pre-vanish, poison cleansing totem pre-emptively on blind. All casters need to learn how to stutter step a spell in order to bait out a kick / pummel / counter spell to get off their crucial heal.
---
6. You have 2 options - Elem which is the winner here, as it is the only spec with any form of reliable consistent dps. Enh is just auto attack and hope for Windfury crits. In pvp, both specs use shocks for burst, but only one spec is really amassing INT to any great effect. An end-game geared Elem / hybrid spec shaman using a 1h dps mainhand + shield can do some very high damage throughout an entire 1v1 fight. Windfury will hit like a truck with a high ilvl slow mainhand, shield makes you tanky, and frost / flame shocks will melt anyone, not to mention your heals are going to pop you for 30%+ per heal, and they have good self heals.
---
7. Absolutely. Tauren have the niche combo of warstomp + firenova totem, or vice versa, which helps line up a lot of burst comboing it with a nature's swiftness + chain lightning combo followed by a frost shock. Even enhancement shaman's use this combo to great effect. Orc is undoubtedly the strongest race for Shaman in pvp, you get spell power and attack power and Shaman is one of the few hybrid classes that can utilize it fully. Stun resist can't be understated. Tauren's are totally fine though, the biggest differences in pvp are going to be engineering trinkets and skill level. 
---
So by your logic I should never group with randoms? Have you ever played vanilla? 
---
GM's do not check for the reports, as they are automated. Just because you are not a asshole doesnt mean that johnny mcdipshit will not gang up with his friends to make sure you get DC'd when you are doing R14 grind for example.
---
&gt; I see your point. On the other hand during classic I got reported countless times (hardcore raid guild and people loved to troll us). In the the end it's just a QOL-feature. A GM will have to check your account anyway.
---
Actually, that's exactly the problem people have with the system. You are guilty until proven innocent. You will be automatically disconnected and have your characters muted "Pending investigation".
---
The "troll reports" you refer to is exactly the kind of reports that would really fuck you over in today's system.
---
They can be fun. I played a ret paladin up to lvl 47 on one last year. I stopped though because I don't want to get burned out before Classic comes out.
---
How do you determine someone is elitist *before* interacting with them? 
---
I guess I'm an elitist in the sense that I try very hard to understand every nuance of the game so that I can be the best player I can be, and never does it bring a feeling of shame to me to ask any of the thousands upon thousands of questions I needed to ask to get a decent understanding of this game. The only shame you should feel is when you decide you know something based on little to no evidence and refuse to ask others to fact check yourself. Info sharing makes us all better.
---
You're going to have lots of elitists no doubt.  However I think the vast majority is overjoyed that an official Classic server is set go to live, and are looking forward to the tight knit communities that existed back then.  In retail you can operate largely in anonymity, there's no repercussions for being an asshole.  In classic, your server is your server, you'll be seeing the same people over and over.  Word of mouth gets around, and people that are habitually douchey will quickly develop a pretty piss-poor reputation across the server.  I also speak for a lot of people that know there's going to be lots of vanilla-virgins trying it out for the first time, and veterans are more than happy to sherpa people through the much less forgiving content and mechanics.
---
If you're trying classic for the first time, have a good attitude, are willing to learn from your mistakes, then you'll have no problem fitting right into the classic community.
---
My wife and I played together since Vanilla and well into Cata.  We quit when Panda was announced and have not been back since.  Our mains were NE druid and hunter.  This time we will be going Horde side.  She'll still roll hunter (troll) and I'm going tauren warrior.  We are looking forward to quests we have never seen before :)
---
Bro i 100% guarantee if you get a rend sword in a run of rogues/warriors they will start a bidding war trying to buy it from you. 
---
It is being overblown like crazy.  People ninja looted in classic just fine without loot trading being a thing and it hardly ever happened (like literally maybe once a year that I saw).  Then again I never played past end of TBC so I have never seen what loot trading combined with whatever other mechanics/community has resulted in.
---
Once you're honored with a faction you get a 10% discount....and that's it.  There's no deeper discount for being revered or exalted.  You can also get a 10% discount if you're at least Rank 3 in PVP.  So 20% total is the highest you can get to save on your mount costs.
---
The first time I encountered an enemy player was in stranglethorn vale. I remember it like it was yesterday, orc shaman ran up to me and smacked me, this was before keybindings, and we are both just standing there auto attacking clicking our abilities. Long story short windfury can eat a fat one.
---
Have you?
---
Hybrids still very much had the hybrid tax in TBC. If a rogue was getting out dpsed by a paladin, then it was a skill or gear issue or a function of that particular encounter. Having every spec be at least usable was not what I'd call bad. I will agree that when they started balancing for arena the game got worse off, but no hybrids were out dpsing pure dps classes for any extended amount of time that I can recall.
---
It's nice that Deadmines had a private mattress
---
Who said it was easy ? I'm merely trying to remove the negative image of Rdruids in dungeons, not having a rezz sux I know but they're not incompetent healers and there is a work-around for not having a rezz.
---
Cleave is myth.
---
Yes, you do a very little TPS(since cleave got bonus threat component like Heroic Strike, but a bit lower) but it cost 5 more rage(8more if speced imp.HS).
---
Nope, real specs are understood as well and actually have functional mechanics. You put equal effort into a spec that doesn't work vs one that does, and you get more out. Increased player knowledge only makes meme specs worse.
---
I hope the cap is a bit higher because I think a ton of people are going to check out Classic, screw around for a bit, and then quit. More than in the original WoW release, for sure, and that would leave way too many dead servers. I think they'll have to do merges as well, but it would lessen the need. I wouldn't want 10k, but a bit higher than 2500 wouldn't break anything IMO. 
---
Hi, played a female dwarf rogue in vanilla trying to be a rare class/race combo. I only saw 2 or 3 other FDRs in all my time in vanilla.
---
I used the word easy because it's literally in the title of the thread.
---
If you think people and inherently bad
---
That says a lot 
---
Whats it like? Its like getting ganked by 60s everywhere from the lowest level contested zone up to max anywhere from 3 seconds to 2 min after you run back to your corpse and revive.
---
Many many ganked corpse runs on a 4x blizzlike established pserver.
---
Well it is very common for rend runs to only have one warrior/rogue because of the item's poor drop chance, they usually refuse to group with other warriors/rogues anyway.
---
But you're right, you might be offered quite a lot of money for that one item. There's really no other item that's shared across so many players and with such a low drop rate, that I know of. (Outside of raids of course, but that's up to guilds anyway)
---
Holy shit this is stupid and I’m laughing in tears
---
lol, this guy is getting upvoted?....ok)) says a lot about the crowd gathering around this topic))
---
I actually raided for a long time as combat daggers, and did well with it. Also Stoneform helps with the rogue or warrior match-up in pvp, which is welcome.
---
The only reason to get exalted with a faction is if the faction is not your own, and you want to buy one of their mounts.  Example:  You're an Orc and your faction mount is the Riding Wolf, but you want one of the cool Troll Raptor mounts, but when you go to try and buy one the Troll mount vendor says "No way Mon".  If you want to buy a Raptor mount, you would have to gain exalted status with the trolls, then you can buy a Raptor mount from them....but you will still only get 10% discount on the price, because the only price discount you get is 10% and that's at honored rep.
---
So to sum up:  If you're gaining rep just to get a lower price for your faction mount, then honored is all you need.
---
If you want to buy a mount that is not your faction, you will need exalted with that faction to be allowed to buy it.
---
And miss out on launch day and the thousands of people farming boars in Elwynn or Durotar??
---
I won't speak for every "oldhead" out there but personally, I'm quite excited at the idea of playing with newbies who are willing to try the game for the first time and maybe be some kind of mentor to some of them along the way. I strongly believe that if older players want the game to succeed, they'll have to dial back the elitism whenever interacting with new players as to not drive them out. Kind of goes without saying. One aspect of Classic everyone is excited about is the community aspect so being a douche kind of goes against that. Honestly, if I were ya, I wouldn't worry about it too much. 
---
Why do people say the healer shouldn't do any mistakes though? even if the healer is playing perfectly it's usually the dps who tend to fuck up and that ends up pressuring the healer, so if anything i'd say dps should focus on not making mistakes and the healer will be fine .\^\^
---
Yup, that's the price you have to pay
---
There was an entire thread on this the other day that I commented on about expanding current wow's continents to include the areas adding in cataclysm.  They would need tweaking from a 3D pov but things like grim batol and the highlands, gilneas, quel'thalas.. they are all there on the continent just not open.  These could be "alternate reality" areas for quest purposes and add dungeons there or raids but they would still be in the world we have, with the professions with with, with the same mats we have.  still would be difficult to implement correctly
---
I totally agree with your points, but again I think we are just arguing over the meaning of "simple." Retail has a plethora of activities to do, things to collect, all classes are more complex, there is just more of everything. Tedious and time consuming does not make something complex.
---
As someone who is/was new to classic WoW, the community was by far the worst part about private servers. You're sort of just expected to know every dungeon and every aspect of the game inside and out, which introduces a ton of stress for players who aren't as familiar with the game. So I share your fears for the official servers.
---
Still a Hunter Weapon.
---
That clearly says patch 2.3.0
---
That is not Vanilla 
---
I've hugely enjoyed playing on them
---
In retrospective i can say that i was a bad shaman and don't worry, we were alot of people being noob at that time, learning bosses, our classes and all their synergies.
---
Whatever happened you now have a chance to redeem yourself!
---
As my kungfu teacher once said to me: we're not getting better at practicing, we're just less bad at it. ;)
---
I think this is a troll post.  If it's not, and this guy is for real - he will go  back to BFA after 2 or 3 days.
---
I really strongly considered cancelling my sub when it was up a couple weeks ago, or rolling it back to 1 month instead of 3 months, but ended up keeping it.  Theres a lot of things im unhappy with in BfA, though i can usually find *something* fun to do.
---
Definitely cant wait for Classic, though &gt;.&lt;
---
Ive actually been working on getting my priest on live geared up a bit, and relearning Holy after not playing it for an xpac or two.  That should keep me entertained for a bit.  Got the inspiration because i think i finally decided on going with a priest in Classic.
---
Honestly if someone did make fun of you based on that you shouldn't really care, you're probably better at the game to begin with. I predominantly played retail and when i play on classic private servers i feel like im pvping 60 year olds, feels like they're all playing on 500ms, no mechanical skill whatsoever. Obviously not everyone but the majority.
---
Depends on what "feeling" you're referring to. I wasn't 13 and carefree when I started playing wow, I just like the game. Private servers can't give you back your childhood if that's what you're looking for but the game is the same. You can still futz around ashenvale and feed your pet and travel half around the world for a first aid skill book.
---
It's 10% each for honored and Rank 3...that's it
---
its just a great game. i thought i dont want to play on private server cause all will be gone when classic starts. but there was nothing else to do so i started playing. and it is just amazing. currently i am lvl 36 and having a blast.
---
holy shit, it's sherlock holmes 
---
Basically:
---
 Groups = nobody cares what you are as long as they know what your role is going to be when you join.
---
Raids = raid leader is probably going to care about some things but in a casual raiding guild you can probably get away with most non-optimal DPS specs as long as you show up/play well.  Tanking paladins just not going to happen in raids anymore thank tanking shamans will, at least for MT.  For like 3rd or 4th string ... maybe? probably not though past MC where adds die pretty quick.
---
Sure, but as I've said already, the discussion has already happened regarding sharding and no loot trading. The no loot trading stance that seems to have come out is ML loot trading only, and only to the ML. Anymore than that is unacceptable to the no loot trading crowd, and that compromise seems to also not be enough for the crowd that wants loot trading, so we're left with no acceptable middle ground without one side having to suck it up.
---
Same thing for sharding. 1-10 zones is acceptable middle ground...but this one also relies on us trusting Blizzard not to make any further changes regarding sharding. They do not have the track record for many of us to trust them to not adjust it further. Better for them to just not touch it, since we know they can't mess things up as a result.
---
*Woah!* It's your **4th Cakeday** everyone-is-a-victim! ^(hug)
---
You can push certain spec performance due to loopholes like Manual Crowd Pummeler and tricks like reshifting, but it's more of a lucky coincidence for feral druids rather than a rule. 
---
There is not much you can do for other specs though. There are a couple of interesting suggestions like Manual Crowd Pummeler spell damage SoR paladin, but don't take it too seriously - it requires pretty much BiS caster gear with very questionable outcome. 
---
You’re probably not going to be able to flask every raid because black lotus isn’t going to be on a dynamic respawn.  Not sure what server you play on but Nost also had the dragon slayer buff on a 2hr cool down instead of 6hr making it far easier to get the buff.
---
Those servers see growth from people who never experienced Vanilla.
---
Sorry, but no. You do not speak for everyone, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with loot trading. It was available via gm ticket in vanilla, and anyone looking to ninja items can just do so via master looter anyways.
---
The idea of random groups of players somehow joining pugs to trade loot to a specific individual is also completely absurd, as that’s not a pug by definition, and again they could do so more effectively with master looter.
---
It’s a complete non issue.
---
The real, underlying issue is that people seem to think that the community will be hyper-toxic full of ninjas, yet absolutely nobody seems to want to try to address that, Which is why I’m confident saying that it’s just hyperbole being spouted to try to advance a “no changes” position.
---
For leveling + WPvP, what do you think about going for Soul Link be Siphon Life?
---
Priests are without a doubt better healers when compared to most healing classes, but they don't bring as much utility that shamans bring. So deciding which you value more is gonna be your struggle. That being said, I'm not really sure either because they're great choices.
---
I’d kill for the posture fix.
---
Sounds about right.  I got to ~30 on a pserver after Classic was announced because I couldn't take the hype anymore.  The first few hours of playing felt like the closest to literal time travel I will ever come.
---
Once that wore off, I was still having fun.  I remember jumping on my first long flightpath (Dustwallow to Darkshore), opening a beer, and just sitting back and chatting with my wife while I watched Azeroth fly past me.  It's such a peaceful experience if you want it to be.
---
That makes sense. As a Shaman I can also rez myself and pretend I didn't even die.
---
Best part of world bosses....kiting Kazzak (before they patched him) all the way to Stormwind and watching the mayhem unfold.
---
Pretty
---
There's nothing else that high in demand, but there are a lot of smaller items where it will just be annoying to get people wanting to buy it from you. Like HoJ, cape from baron, that caster trinket from UBRS, truestrike shoulders, the elven ring from DM, and so on.
---
It's not a huge deal, but it's just unnecessary. Not having loot trading means there are no problems, ever. People don't really click the wrong button ever. Maybe in like 1/100 runs or something at most.
---
Having played on several Blizzlike 1.12.1 pservers, it's definitely the community that recreated the feeling. Some projects like Nost had a strong enjoyment of what made vanilla great because the project facilitated a good sense of community &amp; they were able to recreate many of the features that made this possible where other projects up to that point had not.. Most of the subsequent 1.12.1 Blizzlike server projects have expanded on the Nost core but seem to be missing the same feeling - I think some of this has to do with the player community, who by now has got to experience progression up to Naxx and there seems to be a more mechanical, min/max, been there/done that feeling to it. Feel free to disagree, but I think when Classic drops there will be a great infusion of new players ready to experience true Blizzlike progression. I think that's what most of us want, after all.
---
&gt; Well it is very common for rend runs to only have one warrior/rogue
---
Lol you must be new... jed/rend runs are usually 5+ melee/hunters. 
---
&gt;Lots of people saying it’s all nostalgia while others say it’s just a great game!
---
This is entirely subjective to the player, and what they want out of the game. Vanilla both has its benefits and drawbacks, so it depends whether you view the trade off as a net-benefit.
---
Arguably the biggest benefit to vanilla wow is that it is a far better RPG game which is objectively true in my opinion. Your feeling of character progression comes from so many facets that everything you do feels meaningful.
---
Another big benefit of vanilla wow is that it is a far better MMO. The game makes grouping desirable - the world is scary, unknown, and dangerous (especially on a PvP server). Having an ally by your side makes difficult and impossible tasks doable, and overcoming difficulties with others creates bonds and friendship.
---
However, there are some drawbacks to vanilla wow. The biggest two are class balance is off, and what you want to do will dictate what spec you need to play for your class, and itemization is crappy, to the point where for some classes, tier sets are worse than dungeon blues. So if you made a Paladin hoping to be this bad-ass, plate wearing, sword-wielding holy warrior, you'll be in for quite the surprise when you're forced to cast holy light over and over while wearing a dress, because it's optimal.
---
Now, in comparison to retail, there is basically no RPG element to the game anymore, and very little MMO aspects. 110-120 actually weakens your character, and group finders force you into groups you'd rather not be in to do trivial content. Itemization used to be better, but now it's just an ilevel, you don't have to care about the item at all.
---
A plus side to retail is that all classes and specs are viable. Some suck compared to others, but they all actually work. However even at this point some classes are beyond broken like Shamans.
---
The game is superior to any other WoW expansions. Nostalgia plays a minuscule role, in the sense that nostalgia is the initial reason for a Vanilla player to play on private servers, or to be excited for Classic.
---
But, A LOT of players on the private servers never played during Vanilla, and all of them know that Vanilla was simply a BETTER game.
---
They don't suffer from any nostalgia or rose-colored glasses.
---
And they are the best proof that all this nostalgia crap is nothing but...crap.
---
&gt; and the cheap shot attack sound from a rogue reminding you that contested areas suck
---
Of course there was the 0.25 seconds you see the Rogue right before he opens up, and you hear that stealth sound.
---
FWWWWoooooooowwwwww...... SCHWACK!
---
Once you hit level 16, you will be much harder to beat in PVP.  You will have fear and Voidwalker bubble making you a pain in the butt to fight.  I've found that most people avoid me when I'm leveling on my warlocks.
---
You need to have the mindset you get when you're older, a.k.a don't care what people think. I swear that a vast, vast majority will gladly help you out if you ask for help, tips or whatever.
---

A suggestion from me would be - don't push her too fast, if at all. I know it's super hard to control yourself sometimes, but I found it best to not dump a bunch of info on your GF when she's playing a new game, not overwhelm her with constant "helpful suggestions", telling her how she can do this or that better - basically just help her when she can't figure something out and asks. 
---
Been playing it on multiple servers for years and always have the misfortune of not getting my UBRS drops as a non-melee for like 30 runs... maybe you've always just done the attunement runs where they take literally everyone?
---
Level bank alt to 5 real quick....run to city...learn Enchanting...buy low level dust and wood stick or whatever from the vendor.....make wand.
---
Guide complete.
---
A Reminder to Reddit Posters: You Don't Speak for "Us".
---
Seriously, stop this "we". Sure some people agree with you, not even saying *I* disagree with you, but stop talking for everyone else. I know it is a way to make it seem like you have the whole community behind you and as such reinforce your statement, but it's a cheap trick when you can't really speak for anyone but yourself.
---
I think Vanilla just has a more consistent level of difficulty. Few things in the game are completely faceroll easy. In BFA, I'm sure Mythic and possibly Heroic raids are way harder than Naxx, and Mythic+ can get as hard as you want it to, but everything else is a joke. 
---
Raid finder, island expeditions, dungeons, warfronts, questing, basically everything the casual player has time to do is impossible to fail. There is literally 0 challenge in 95% of the game, and then 5% is very difficult for boring rewards. I lost interest pretty quick.
---
It's most common in divorce proceedings, since those are frequent and the volume of horror stories make it a known and undeniable thing. The rule is that you never let lawyers and courts get involved because they'll manipulate you into giving them way more than your spouse could have ever hoped to take. I don't know what level of collusion exists in other arenas. 
---
Technically it's illegal BTW. Too bad these prosecution and defense lawyers and judges go out to lunch together. 
---
Vanilla is easy and there isn’t much left to figure out after years of Pservers ; that being said most people generally likes carrying a sub optimal spec in their group. 
---
Good to see the toxic part of wow is still here
---
&gt;Is vanilla wow just a genuinely great game or are we all wearing those rose tinted goggles?
---
I was one of the people who actually hated WoW at launch because it was basically a casual version of everquest. Now I play on private servers and am eagerly waiting for WoW Classic. I didn't hate WoW back in the day because it was a bad game, but mostly because there were games out there that I thought were better.
---
There has been a major shift in MMO design over the past 20 years. MMOs now are designed around dungeons and combat instead of dungeons and combat being part of the world. Basically developers focused soley on everything that made me think WoW was shit and built games around it.
---
I think classic will be well received simply because it is bringing back a taste of these older, RP oriented games. There really isn't any MMO out there that caters to people who want this type of gameplay. Even people like me, who didn't like WoW back in the day will be trying it out because we are so starved for a MMO that doesn't hold your hand all the time.
---
I never said you didn't :)
---
Where did I say the healer shouldn't make mistakes?  You seem to interpret my post as anti-druid, which was not the point of my comment in the first place.  First of all, LBRS is easily the longest, most trash-filled dungeon in vanilla.  It takes a solid group a minimum of 2 - 3 hours.  You then factor in that its completion is a requirement for progressing to endgame, so the people who are doing it for attunement are most likely still running with leveling gear, so even just stepping into the dungeon you're handicapped.  You then factor in the amount of pats, trash packs,  and lots of bosses with funny mechanics.  What happens when your tank gets hexed by Shadow Hunter Vosh'gajin?  She runs around the room, two shotting people at her leisure.  Even the best druid healer on earth isn't going to save people from getting dumpstered by a boss.  People are going to die.  That's the nature of the dungeon, largely regardless of what type of healer you bring.  The length of the dungeon dictates that someone having to corpse run is going to be trapped by respawns, again that's the nature of the dungeon.  Add in the fact that most groups take shortcuts, there's going to be no way for the majority of the group to fight their way back to the person who died.   You can skip most of the bossfights, you only need Drakkisath for the attunement, but there's still lots of opportunities to get caught off guard.
---
My comment wasn't an attack on druids, or healers not doing their jobs, etc.  It was merely to state the fact that LBRS is no fucking joke, it's required if you want to participate in endgame, and deaths are frequent and routine.  Bringing a healer with one res every half hour makes the stakes that much higher.
---
He says the pressure is on to not making any mistakes. But not that the pressure is on anyone in particular. The group as a whole has a more difficult time recovering from mistakes due to the only rez available has a 30 minute cooldown. Regardless of who makes the mistake leading to the death.
---
Did I get one? A r/woooosh
---
That's literally what I said.
---
My actual vanilla experience (not some pserver crap) was that pugging died by the time you reached BRD (low 50s), and everything became guild content.
---
In my experience anyone that's genuinely good at the game are happy to give advice and help because they did the work to improve and dont ridicule others for being in the same place they once were.
---
There is however shitheads that think they're good but actually suck at the game. Those are usually toxic but just don't be bothered honestly they're just dumb. You can't get offended by stupid people.
---
I have only played on a private server a few times. I never played Vanilla when it was released, so I can't compare it to the real deal, but I feel as if Classic and present day WoW are two completely different games. I like both since both have their own personalities, positives, and negatives. I like games that are a bit challenging like WoW Classic, but I also like games that are also balanced like Current Day WoW.
---
Haha just messing with ya man. Just a very uncommon thing to see people praising undead in plate armor, when normally it is Orcs / Tauren / human. 
---
If you like undead warrior , all the power to you! 
---
Although I never witnessed this myself in game, that was one of the coolest youtube videos lol
---
How is this a woosh? Literally the next comment is someone talking about how Ironfoe isn’t a good hunter weapon because they don’t melee enough.
---
So I know im in the minority (or possibly just silent Majority) but leveling is the most important thing for me in classic. I enjoy going from zone to zone and doing quests (regardless of whether i read them or not, which i will in classic) but I ALSO really enjoy leveling in retail. by the end of the last expansion i had something like 16 max level (110) toons with several more very close. In BFA I am sitting at about 6 with several more on the way. 
---
I just really enjoy leveling in world of warcraft but have recently gotten into some of the end game stuff, which i didn't really do in classic/tbc. Like i am currently trying to do more Mythic Plus keys and a little pvp and pug raids. THe best part is that it is getting me so excited for classic. I want to try out the raids that i never got to step foot in and get some of the gear i drooled over in Org. 
---
Retail is still very enjoyable to me and that is good because that means i will enjoy classic a thousand times more. they are both obviously WoW but i will essentially be playing 2 MMOs. that means cut back a couple hours of sleep and spend a little less time with the wife ;) at least for the first few months. 
---
Because of the every weapon is a hunter weapon ongoing joke for 12 years now. Even if they cant use it.
---
Everything is a hunter weapon. Might not be useful for me, *\*cough\*,* I mean for the hunters, but hunters just really want it.
---
This seems to be a pro-argument towards what I am saying. For these two instances, there have been discussions and a middle ground for both groups has been found. And as long as it is acceptable for all, it is good enough.
---
There is no point in whether or not we can trust Blizzard because we have now way of controlling their behavior. We can only try to work towards an acceptable outcome for all of us through discussions.
---
And if it starts to become unacceptable, then stop giving them your money. This they will definitely understand. As long as people keep buying, companies will sell.
---
Oh my gosh I completely forgot about this guy...
---
Scientifically speaking, you would acquire a higher level of joy playing alliance because you haven’t done it before.
---
It's harder to immerse yourself knowing everything we know today about wow and how the game played. Private servers don't have the same stats as vanilla either.. because we simply don't have access to the values. That's why some trash mobs feel over tuned. I mean raiding was more so difficult because nobody knew what the hell we were doing. Mechanics weren't a search away. People were under geared.
---
I think you'll find that on a fresh server it's a little more complicated than that! I wish all those mats to make it came from thin air, though.
---
Only if you make your own addon for it before you start your character.
---
Well it depends. If they won't do GM tickets to fix loot issues and the choice is between loot trading and no system at all I'll pick loot trading. 
---
They are a pretty close representation of vanilla, even if everything is essentially eyeballed. There is a sense of it being off. But if you don't focus on Minor details, you won't really notice it's not a mirror.
---
"You know, I know this steak doesn't exist. I know that when I put it in my mouth, the Matrix is telling my brain that it is juicy and delicious. After nine years, you know what I realize? Ignorance is bliss."
---
That being said, blizzard is not delivering a exact version either, just a more numerical accurate version. 
---
I got killed by this while leveling. I was in SW AH and got shadowbolted one shot. Stayed s ghost after a few corpse runs and just watched the mayhem.
---
And I said yes, never contested that TBC had more fleshed out talent trees. I just wanted to shut down the TBC hype before it even got started.
---
So your solution in life is to never make any mistakes ever in order to prevent mistake? 
---
When you hear a Defias Pillager aggro
---
By that logic shouldn't he go play a different game since he already played Vanilla?
---
You know what........Me 2!
---
How hard is healing as a shaman? I've never healed in vanilla so im kind of hesitant to do it because a lot of people have told me that it's quite challenging, but i really like the lore, the habilities, the utility and even the gear of the class, so i really liked the idea of making a Tauren Shaman. I LOVE Taurens and early leveling in Mulgore.
---
People tell me i should make a priest instead, but it does not call my attention very much... besides, healing with an undead seems weird to me lore wise and my main will be a Troll Hunter so i don't want another troll.
---
Important: i plan to do mostly PVE (raids) and maybe some PVP to kill time.
---
I can hear the music and smell the woods
---
"Do private servers recreate the feeling"?
---
the feeling of playing classic wow- YES
---
the feeling of playing vanilla wow in 2005?- NO
---
vanilla wow evolved alot over the years and its impossible to recreate the feeling you had back in the day. however the game itself is very well emulated on non-blizzard servers.
---
I leveled a character in retail to level 10 to be able to post on the forums.
---
I just ran around not paying attention to anything, attacking anything I can, pressing all my buttons on cooldown. Never even got remotely close to dying.
---
Extremely boring. It took me almost a week on and off just to get to level 10, because I couldn't stand playing too long.
---
Contrast that to Vanilla where on a private server I've already go two lvl 60s and three lvl ~30s, all in the span of three months.
---
This reminds me of Guild Wars 2 art.
---
I'm happy with them add more quests or low level dungoens in zones that are very empty. Such as azshara. I'm also happy with them making tweaks to items over time if we discover something broken or underpowered. I'm not happy with new zones that take away world value.
---
Silverpine Forest is 100% the best zone for me.  I don't have the same nostalgia for the starting zones that everyone else seems to, but man, when my character gets to the 2nd zone, that's how you know it's getting real.  The fact that I've leveled more Undead than anything else, coupled with the fact that the zone culminates in SFK (my favorite instance) make Silverpine something special.
---
Or maybe BFA goes down the drain and only classic and classic+ will remain. Although I agree with u/gregg_cumia that classic servers will probably lose a lot of their population after the launch of classic+.
---
If BFA (or whatever retail becomes) actually does die, it should not be too hard to make a "classic+ hardcore" and a "classic+ casual", with different servers. Casual would have features like lfd, lfr etc. whereas hardcore would not.
---
Hi, /u/Valgar_Gaming
---
Jumping on that big wheel on the ship, when getting overwhelmed.
---
I really feel like loot trading is solving a problem that really isn't there. I understand it's a way to avoid having GM's doing it manually. The thing is, loot trading *obviously* has a ton of flaws. It can be abused heavily.
---
And I can't help but thinking, why even implement it? No one force Blizzard to have GM's helping with loot tickets. Honestly, it is a player mistake and as such I don't see the problem. Sure it would be nice if it could have a fix without any negative consequences, but it doesn't, and as such I'd say just don't do anything about it. Someone makes a mistake? Sucks, but that's how it is. It's normal in games to have permanent consequences based on choices. If you missclick something it's your own fault. Yes it might be harsh, but it's not a problem. Adding a system that can *easily* be abused is just dumb (and since it's the internet and people are anonymous there will be a lot of people ready to abuse it).
---
And I know, not having GM's available for loot problems is not "blizzlike", but it's closer than adding loot trading.
---
Of course, loot trading will make all weapons even more hunter weapons, you see we have to buy our bullets/arrows, feed our pets and pay our repa... ah sorry no need for that :D
---
 /2 WTS [Ironfoe], PST with serious offers!
---
Not really they're bad because of bad game design.
---
Remember that most games that get proper support (not anthem) get patches and updates over thier life time. You can't play reign of chaos like it was at patch 1.0. If you want to play on battle net. Some change is healthy, bfa level change isn't. 
---
The zone that kind of hit me yesterday was Loch Modan.  I was actually having some trouble finding screenshots of the lake, which made me a bit sad.  
---
I seem to remember it being a very serene zone...just peaceful and beautiful.  Its really a shame that the dam was destroyed :(
---
For all you enh shamans out there what realistic 2h weapons are your goal? Obviously we all want sulfuras, dark edge of insanity, maybe even might of menethil. But what other more realistic options do you guys have planned? Im thinking drake talon cleaver and herald of woe.
---
If it is affected by stance, zerker stance only increases crit chance not flat damage. The mobs probably just had less resists or something.
---
I dont know if im an "oldhead" but im excited to help and talk to "newbies" to Share their wonder
---
I'm guessing he's referring to Blackcrow.
---
I am playing BotW right now and it's amazing (I know I'm late to the party)... So good that I am doing my best to try and beat it before Classic launches.
---
If you enjoyed private servers, you’ll enjoy classic even more. Private server players are for the most part people who are really motivated and willing to put up with a lot of shit to play a very (very) similar version of the game, and even there you find people who have literally no clue what they are doing, classic will be even more of this,
---
In a closed circuit ecosystem with fewer players. Gonna be great dude 
---
Great story! And I suspect most of us had similar experiences. That's what is going to be hard to recapture with Classic thogh -- that feeling of wonder and scale. We all want to re-live it, but we're only geting the game, not the feeling. Still, I'm pumped!
---
Nah man don’t worry about it. I shared the same doubts and anxiety myself during vanilla when it launched. I eventually found a raiding guild, showed up consistently, and became an integral part of the team. You will find that, too (if you see it through)
---
Assuming we are speaking of a game of equal quality, this doesn’t exist. 
---
Imagine playing with your friend, a combat rogue, and pugging with a random mage.
---
Running BRD for the hell of it.
---
Ironfoe drops.
---
Mage needs, so you need as well. You win it. Pass it to your friend.
---
Loot trading is neutral. Any scenario you come up with where a group uses LT to screw you over can be rephrased as a scenario where a ninja is thwarted.
---
This picture with ashenvale music. This is the closest to a visual representation of my fondest most early memory of classic. Wandering through the forest, mystified by the colours, thw ambience... Magical.
---
I still think about the hilarious broken english a chinese farmer said to my raid guild fighting Azuregos.
---
Join me to your fight team.... classic
---
Also friendship are formed through ransoms first and if you enjoy one particular person you befriend them
---
I want an elemental da agua

---
Priest. More specifically shadow. Faces will melt. 
---
For me, I'll stick to the Alliance. Sure, leveling from lvl 33 to 45 fells like standing bare-footed on an erupting vulcano , still. Depending on the class you will level between six to teen days realtime. After that it's all about the flair. Which citys do you like the most? What is your favorite race? etc. 
---
Jed/rend isn't an attunement for anything... farmed TS on two characters and BR on my pally in the last two years, the group is usually majority melee. There is literally nothing for casters/healers outside of BR 
---
lean towards him and whisper in his ear:  
---
"Why, I ask  
---
It just doesn't make much sense  
---
That a man of your stature  
---
Should have to wear a dress"
---
Yeah, its your anxiety. Not something you want to have, especially for playing a game that is 100% a social game.
---
I am one of those "oldheads".Not only that I am 46 years old, I also played Vanilla AND private servers, so I am also an elitist. 
---
But, I think you are confusing terms here, or put them in a category that they don't belong. You aren't (and shouldn't) afraid of elitist oldheads...you are afraid of DICKBAGS.
---
The problem is that you believe that most oldhead elitist players are dickbags...when the reality is that most of them aren't. During my 15 years WoW experience, I met will people that were absolutely STUPID, playing a class for like 2 years and not knowing even the BASICS of that class.
---
But I never called them stupid or refuse to help them.
---
However, in some cases, some of those STUPID players, when I tried to help them and to give them advices, they not only didn't listen, but they plain said "I don't care, its just a game. I play it as I like it".
---
Well, calling them stupid, openly, and add them to the ignore list was the only logical thing I could do.
---
Will I do the same in Classic?
---
YES. If a player is stupid, and I will try to help him, and he will refuse my help because I am an "elitist"...I will call him stupid and I will add it to my ignore list. I will play a Prot Warrior at 60, and while being on an ignore list might not be a big deal in retail...in Classic, on a limited population realm, being on a tank ignore list is a big deal...because I will make sure that everyone in my guild, my friends and that guy's guild will also know that he is an idiot, and not worth the time playing with him.
---
The fact that some players are more skilled or more knowledgeable will, in most cases, not result in shaming the lesser ones. But it will 100% result in shaming (and not only) if the lesser ones are stupid enough or stubborn enough to ignore or brush off advices or help.
---
Absolutely! But I loved the mechanics of the world bosses in classic, mainly because I love world PvP
---
&gt; My biggest issue with loot trading is that it's a solution to a problem that doesn't exist.
---
The problem is the constant cost of CM support for players trying to correct mislooting problems.
---
I love playing a good support class and I enjoy healing in raids but I prefer having a more damaging class when I pvp.
---
Is there a hybrid spec for Shaman that allows you to off-heal while doing decent damage? Preferably Enhancement but Elemental would be acceptable, too.
---
I have a Priest on Retail Wow and I'm kinda' bored of it - Maybe slightly off-topic but how different is Vanilla Priest to current? (Minus the obvious Discipline changes)
---
I was part of two pairs of top alliance and horde guilds on my server who were colluding around killing the green dragons; because nature resist gear with great other stats is vital for AQ. You'd get banned if you griefed your own faction. So for example, we, an alliance guild, couldn't just run in and purposely die to spawn loads of toxic mushrooms while the other alliance guilds tried to emeriss. We instead allied ourselves with a horde guild to wipe them for us. We would then try to kill him while the horde guild protected us from the alliance guild. Then we'd return the favor on the next one. The other top alliance guild did the same back to us with allying with another top horde guild. Essentially it came down to who had the most players online during off hours to sneak kills in or prevent others from doing it. The guilds ended up despising each other, even though we were the same faction and we grew close to our horde counterparts.
---
Good times
---
lmao amazing, miss running into the gold farmers ahaha
---
Me too. I remember hopping on at 6am before school at 8. I MUST PLAY.
---
Lol no, rend runs are filled with warriors amd rogues. Because of Truestrike shoulders, and the rend drops.
---
it doesnt recreate the feeling at all for anyone whose memories are mostly 2004/2005.  1.12 is a very different experience from early wow 
---
Yea, if it was sealed it's worth selling. 
---
Used - it's worth keeping it as a great memory.
---
Not necessarily, those "problems" you list are not necessarily problems. 
---
&gt;too many tickets about loot
---
People aren't entitled to GM's fixing player made mistakes. Should they help you when you wipe on a boss too?
---
&gt;people quitting over loot mistakes
---
This has got to be a joke, right? So you want to implement a system that can (and will) be abused to ninja in groups in order to not make some kids ragequit? Let's just follow that logic for a bit. Tons of kids will ragequit from unfair PvP matches since class balance is nonexistent in a 1v1 fight. Should we then start to re-balance classes? Or implement a system to award them something anyway so they don't quit? Yeah, that would be retarded.
---
&gt; If you're not addressing either of those problems and just putting your fingers in your ears while shrieking "no loot trading!!!!!!" then you are irrelevant to the discussion.
---
Except that's not what people are doing. We don't *need* to address those "problems", because they are irrelevant. The first can at least be discussed, the second "problem" is downright retarded. It's not everyone else that are irrelevant to the discussion, it's *you*. At least learn the arguments there are presented for and against something before you try to put your own opinion on a pedestal.
---
Awesome video! 😉
---
I could probably draw the layout of many classic dungeons because I died so many times in them. The dungeons are easy if you know everything but if you fuck up then there will be a wipe.
---
I barely even remember anything from the BFA dungeons because almost everyone one shots them. Don't even have to stop for mana because the mana bar doesn't even fucking budge on my frost spec. It is absurd.
---
There are over 57 thousand subscribers to this sub. Chances are some of us will die before classic comes out. Let's hold a moment of silence for our brothers and sisters who won't be able to relive this masterpiece.
---
It's considered socially impolite to rephrase someone's opinion in a way that makes them look stupid
---
So in my experience it has two warriors for disarm, two or tree rogues. 1 Hunter and the two healers. Rest is filled with casters
---
Ultimately, I'm still waiting for Blizzard to make a new MMO with the sam sense of scale and adventure as Vanilla. But I'm going to enjoy the trip back with Classic. I got into raiding too late in the cycle, so most of my experience at the time was in MC and ZG. I'm eager to go back and clear all the content for the first time. I also feel like I know what I'm getting into -- I'll have no regrets ditching retail for a bit.
---
The Night Elf starting zone will forever remain my favorite, just because of its ambience, the colors... Everything. It's like exploring a painting.
---
There's a limit on how much you can get from a class.
---
There's still people theorizing in pservers about spellpower ret paladin, how some items apparently scaled off SP, judgement stacking and SoR proccing stuff. That's legit modern theorycraft (though not everything is confirmed) that could make ret paladin "ok".
---
But other classes, like moonkin, only have one ability in their rotation, for example. They're limited because of the debuff limit aswell, and any min-max you could find for it, would also benefit a mage.
---
It all depends man.
---
Yeah, I'm actively pushing a lot of people who got into WoW post-Vanilla to give it a try. I'm sure many will give up before 60, but for those tha stick with it, I'm excited for the journey they'll get to take.
---
Loktar Ogar
---
I really don't have specific spec ideas but Elemental and Restoration share gearing closer than Enhancement and Restoration.
---
That's a self imposed problem though. Just say "no take backsies" and have no support for that kind of stuff.
---
When you give more control to the players it always enhances the game. When you add systems or CM's into the mix to try and control the experience it just becomes worse, always.
---
More like clicking the chains.
---
Not exactly. Your example of 3 people needing an item and you win means you actually need it. The fact that you rolled already means you need it. Asking you "need?" after you just rolled need is essentially the same as asking "did you ninja that item and if so, can I please have it?".
---
On retail you have personal loot, so when you get an item it doesn't actually mean you need it. You didn't roll for it or anything, you just got it - might already have something better. This is why people /w "need?", there is a chance you don't really care for the item. 
---
So the big difference is, on retail you can get an item you don't need, where as in vanilla if you roll for an item you don't need it means you are a ninja (in which case asking "need?" probably won't be very useful, considering you just ninja'ed the loot).
---
I never really had the chance to experience level 60 in vanilla WoW (didn't hit max level until WotLK). Looking foward to shit like this in classic.
---
&gt; I saw it once over ~6 years of playing Vanilla WoW.
---
Multiply your experience by 12,000,000 players. Let's say that everyone saw it just once in 6 years... that's 2,000,000 misloots a year.
---
Now let's say that every misloot takes an hour to resolve. The CM has to investigate logs, verify the story is correct, perhaps contact the player who should have gotten the loot, etc.
---
That's 12,000,000 man-hours. Let's say that CMs are paid crap... just $10/hour.  That's $120 million in support costs over 6 years... $20 million every year.
---
Exactly how is this not a problem that, as a business, Blizzard should not be addressing?
---
Long story short
---
Wait for classic before theorycrafting
---
Values are more than likely to change since Ps are not 100% accurate 
---
Problem is when you start theory crafting things like that you're really getting into the weeds of private server accuracy. So maybe you make it work on a given private server? That's nice and all, but I'm more interested in waiting for actual Classic to see what happens.
---
10/10 shitpost
---
Are you insinuating that you agree with what Ion said? 
---
?... What? 
---
When all the gnolls in a camp spawn around you.
---
I've played since the day WoW launched.  I'm also worried that I'm not hardcore enough to play.
---
So that makes two of us.  I'm sure it's fine.
---
Hi, I'm paranoid and cry about stuff that won't matter. Whats your name? Oh wait, I'm you.
---
Yeah, there was some character that you can still find if you go on PS.
---
I wish I could go back to a time when I knew nothing about the game and rediscover it again. I miss that adventure.
---
Read your last sentence over and over until you do :)
---
well... The Unstoppable Force will be a really easy one to get
---
He won that day
---
I'll open with cheap shot after he finishes killing those 3 mobs
---
I played in vanilla and have played on some private servers, i Always try to help new players in general or trade chat, a lot of us really want you to have a Good first experience with classic just as we had back in the days, so dont worry, we exist :D
---
Wow. Just wow. Hella spooky.
---
Hey what if they changed everything in Classic to be like it is in retail so that it's all easier for you....that sounds great!
---
...and does anyone else hate the word "viable" as much as me?
---
I hope you have proof to back up your claim that " 
---
"the vast majority of the WoW playing community are Retail WoW  ...... And they want Retail WoW models/animations over the Classic art."
---
because me thinking you've pulled that out of your ass.
---
I completely agree however that if its a client side change, that doesn't affect another persons gameplay or visuals, then by all means add it.   If player 1 wants to delve into classic #nochanges mode, then he can have the 2004 graphics, but if player 2 wants updated graphics, then why not let them both have what they want.
---
Honestly, many of the best guilds still didn't care. Death &amp; Taxes had a ret paladin, Nihilum had a balance druid I believe.
---
everyone tell you to heal as a priest, and in my opinion thats a really stupid answer, yes priest are the god healers in vanilla, buy you need a mix of all clases, otherwise your area gearig people REALLY slow, and progressing far slower than having others healers / DPS that are not top...
---
Shaman is great for reaid healers, and totems provide VERY useful buffs
---
Then why implement it. That's the whole issue..
---
Or going up too close to Greenskin at the beginning of the top walkway and pulling the rest of the boat. Good times!
---
Good mindset, I wish you success on release. 
---
Elemental Shaman
---
Oh god, yeah! Western plaguelands was actually a messed up place. It felt genuinely dangerous. And walking into there as a lvl 9 n00b and getting wrecked. 
---
Khadgar? Remember us? The horde? BG death dealers
---
Please go play Halo
---
you will enjoy it buddy!
---
also, there will be A LOT of priest healing, so shaman will have WAY lower cometition.
---
"Keyboard turning? That’s bad? Like how else am I supposed to play other than WASD?" 
---
This must be a troll post...
---
It's not the right-clicking part, it's what can happen to a player if there's a coordinated right-click on him. If you don't think this won't happen in BGs, you're naive.
---
Thats amazing, at the time I wasnt aware that some alliance and horde guilds would do stuff like this. I was surprised to learn similar stuff happened to get rank 14 in PvP.
---
I never said a shaman would chain heal a tank. I was just saying a priest can either heal for the same amount, faster (flash heal, heal) or for more (greater heal) than a shaman spamming chain heal. Not to mention a shaman main priority is keeping totem buffs up. Over healing is hard to minimize. Especially on a healer that is only using a 2.5 second casted heal. Also keep in mind that toping the healing meters isn't everything. Shaman's are brought for their utility, not because they can put out the healing numbers of a priest. 
---
Why would I have any interest in anything you say?  I was answering the OP question.  Go away.
---
Amazing 
---
STOP SAYING DEB-UFF ARIOGJIORJOJIEOGJELGRJKL
---
So are you saying that since he is the minority his opinion is less valid and shouldn't be taking into account?
---
I also prefer the old character models over the new ones, so between us 3, you are the minority opinion, does that now make your voice less valid?
---
Classic is about bringing back the OLD game, not modernizing it.  If updated graphics are a player option, then thats an ok change, however to tell someone that their desire for Blizzard to fulfill their promise of 'no changes' is wrong because a vocal groups disagrees then you is plain selfish.
---
You can equip worse gear, and then trade it after. It's not hard to do. So your point isn't really all that good, it's not a point really. Just hopeful thinking
---
I didn't say that lmao how's the reading comprehension going.
---
There is no spell hit talent and almost none of the early cloth gear has spell hit. Shadowbolt is a high dmg spell with buffs considered and you have ruin so it hurts when it crits. Sac/Ruin feels like a meme build because you can start out a fight one of two ways; you can cast 4 shadowbolt and get resist on all of them, or you can cast 4 shadowbolt, more than half of the crit and the boss one shots you. Warlocks scale really REALLY well with gear, regardless of which expansion. They do real well once spell hit gear becomes more frequent. 
---
Couldn’t even make it half way through this comment
---
Well, if you have enough time you could make 2 characters. If not, i would say you could make and Horde character of a race you've never made or reached level cap with in Vanilla... because, for the Horde!
---
I recall pallys killing rogues
---
And even if they were neck-to-neck, that’s wrong
---
Pally is balanced well in vanilla. Best pvp healer, and with engineering decent pvp, but struggles in pve dps as it should given it’s a damn tri-spec class
---
The moment they made pally dps and tank viable in tbc, they became a go-to-class and their hybrid-ness just crushed other one trick classes like rogues or wars
---
No you don't win.
---
You keep thowing this "Vast Majority" and "Vast Minority" around like its fact rather than your own baseless opinion.  Also, the "vast majority" on public forums are a very tiny "vocal minority" of a player base, they just whine the loudest.
---
Exactly.
---
"Aze-eroth"
---
You might not, but the vast majority of players will still do pugs. There are good arguments against loot trading but most players will not care and will not be affected whether loot trading exists or not. 
---
nowdays, the majority of guilds is full of wannabe "hardcore" players, and the vast majority will tell you, that a fury warrior with nightfall is better.
---
i wont be playing as a shaman, but i really hope that some underdog raid specs get their spots...
---
I was ranting about this the other day on this sub, I don't blame you.
---
That said, they didn't have to make WoW Classic and they didn't have to do no-changes. So I do want to reward that. Even if I think Blizzard is a bit of a douchebag company at the moment, I do want to reward them when they do something good.
---
Thanks but no. I need to think about my character because the wait is unsustainable. Maybe for you too since you're looking /r/classicwow/ section. Am I right ?  
---
Man riding through the plaguelands was always so brutal. Getting dismounted in one of the overrun towns was a death sentence every time.
---
How about 10 man's or 15 man's. Ubrs dal rends drop. Warrior, Hunter, rogues will need on it. Same for alot of other items. And maraudon ring is his for alot of melee or ferals. It is an issue
---
ive lost atleast 5 hours of my life to this over the years. 
---
This post somehow managed to make me even more hyped for Classic than I already was.
---
VANCLEEF PAY BIG FOR YOUR HEAD!
---
Good luck to you both! I hope we can make it to Darkshore without any rage quits on her behalf xD
---
You don't really know anything about Classic WoW, do you?
---
All those mats?  It's all sold by the vendor.  I made a bank alt when Nost and Ely and Northd launched and had no problem doing it this way.  Not sure why this huge guide is required just too make a lvl 5 wand...oh and by the way, every enchanter in Classic will be making them and putting them on AH, and they are always super cheap because of market saturation...and with fresh server they will be even cheaper.  It will probably be much faster just to farm up 10s and buy one.
---
He said rogues will give you trouble, dont see the irony in your post. 
---
I would be ok with that solution but apparently Blizzard is not.
---
Not wrong =D 
---
I'm kind of sad because my GF doesn't seem to like me playing. Even if she'd be understanding of raid nights when I played on retail, after I quit and said I might try out classic she was like "pls no".
---
She's not a gamer so she doesn't get it, at all. Which is annoying.
---
10/10
---
 I do but no point rushing , won’t make it come faster
---
You know, one thing I enjoyed most about classic was the leveling experience.
---
It's sad because Blizzard has tried to make it work but the leveling is so badly botched on classic and maybe they underestimate how much it hurts their game. (I mean, it probably made good business sense to give free max lvl chars for that reason.)
---
15 years of blizzard fixing loot problems is not something they want to overnight throw away. They have always done it, and to change now would be a customer service nightmare. You will still get a fuckton of tickets for messed up loot, even if you respond with "We don't fix that" they will keep coming. Plus the fact that it is rarely a problem for the same person more than a couple times, so stopping one person from ticketing for it will not stop others. 
---
They won't pay for the GM's needed to handle those tickets, so what we get is the system that has worked well for years, with none of the problems people here are suspecting there will be. 
---
Never heard of it. Are you sure you don't mean Shadow Priest?
---
Also values are VERY likely to change due to databases being different , the exercise   Is fun but it could be useless by launch but who knows 
---
I think it's the other way. A player willing to look at excel spreadsheets for a video game are likelly traying to learn everything possible to help him get better.
---
I'd compare it to people that read frame data of fighting games. It gives you a huge edge over those that don't.
---
Fake
---
&gt; People seem to keep forgetting this, thinking only those of us who have been playing on private server are looking forward to this. 
---
Those people are also the people that say that Classic will have, at best, 500k players.
---
Those people can't seem to understand that not even 1/10th of the future Classic players played on private servers.90% of those who will play Classic are refusing to play on private servers...for a multitude of reasons (non-permanency, private servers drama, zero customer support, gold selling is legit, etc.).
---
It's not hard to realize that Classic will have at least 10 times more players compared to private servers, and that will mean that for every single private server player (and most of them aren't even hardcore) there will be 10 Classic players from outside private servers.
---
Out of the 4-5 millions of people that will play Classic, only a small fraction will be from private servers, and even a smaller fraction will be hardcore players.
---
Come home and rejoin the ranks of the Horde. Lok'tar!
---
...Seriously though try both out. The lovely thing is you will have all the time in the world. Of warcraft.
---
Yeah when I was around rank 10 I gave up going for GM  when I found out 4 people, two of them being guildies were account sharing to get to 14. I'm okay with what I did with the dragons because it was "legal" but I wasn't gonna fuck with account sharing. 
---
Cool tank weapon !
---
Horde get to kill Gnomes.  Alliance have to group with the tiny gross babies.  Seems like an easy choice. 
---
Well, testing in privates may not be 100% accurate, but I think it's a good start.
---
Some people in this sub think that privates are 100% different and it's not the case. Of course it's not the same exact experience/stats but some things will surelly apply.
---
I really don't get all this pserver hate. We're only getting Classic because of pservers.
---
And where did I say that shaman should be topping healing meters was the goal?  I merely said the reason people like chain heal is that it's the only smart heal in vanilla.  If you're overhealing as a shaman spamming chain heal, you're doing it wrong.  It's by far the easiest spell to NOT overheal with.
---
Yes, its a PvP server, but then get rid of all the quest markers, and quest objectives.  Its PvP server so nothing else matters except killing each other right?  While your at it, get rid of dungeons and raids since neither one of them have anything to do with PvP.
---
Squash like bug. Keep pigtails for Orc house.
---
Man feels good to be a warrior come classic, ooh staff with stamina, need! Leather belt with attack power need! Mail chest with strength and crit need! I hope you see the fallacy in your statement
---
I did the mallet of zulfarrak quest chain on my hunter and didn’t know I couldn’t learn to use maxes anywhere, rip.
---
Great writeup, thank you. I was hesitant of being pally but now I am seriously considering it.
---
I hate that. It's so lazy 
---
No, it's what 99.9% of the playerbase will do. And people like you, that are paranoid about every other player, are the only ones that'll use this kind of exploit.
---
It's in the client and has literally no downside?
---
The ones who advocatted for classic when the shutdown most and signed a petition.
---
&gt; More than anything else, doing your job and not making mistakes will always be king in vanilla.
---
QFT. It's more about mechanics than numbers. Don't die, and don't make your healers go OOM, and you can all live longer to punch out the numbers.
---
&gt; but I agree in most PvE content it will barely make a difference
---
Just a simple example: Mage's Blizzard. If you click, you have to move the mouse away from the area you want to blizzard, go click blizzard, and then bring the mouse to that area again.
---
It's really obivous you lost some time there, as opposed to already having the mouse where you want, and hitting "1" or w/e.
---
Other examples could be:
---
- Dispell
---
- You are hitting an enemy and need to interrupt a cast from another enemy, well good luck being a clicker
---
- Raid Healing
---
There's nothing subjective about clicking. It IS worse than binding.
---
I was already hooked on the game, but the absolute absurdity of the voice acting and poor audio mixing of these lines made me fall in love with dungeons.
---
Thanks I was on mobile travelling! You the MVP
---
If you happen to find a BiS reckoning gear for PvP resource, send it my way.
---
Thank you :)
---
Similar experience for me.  I was a fresh 60 and had done MC maybe once or twice at that point and remember going to my first world boss and just being in complete Awe of the variety of guilds there.  It was in the afternoon so the raid became a mix of all the top guilds (not too many people were online for 1 guild or two to solo it) and a lot of them had t2 from bwl from before it was visually reworked and at that point I was there with full blues.  I remember inspecting a night elf priest from the servers best guild (I was also a priest) and he had all the t2 when it was yellow...  I literally thought they were gods but also felt super cool to be int he same raid as them trying to kill the same dragon.  
---
On that note is there a source of what t2 gear looked like before their visual updates? 
---
Can you tell me the total cost of this guide...ie...buying skinning/leatherworking/tailoring/mats to make the stuff/the recipes...can you give me a rough total of how much this guide will cost to complete, so that if I see one of these wands on AH for less than that, I can just buy one and skip all this.
---
I remember there was a website that had tons of theorycrafting for all classes back in vanilla. Everyone seemed to use it, can't remember the name of it.... Surely that would still have relevant information if it's still available? 
---
Anyone know what site I'm referring to?
---
Let's go back my boy... into a wonderful world.
---
&gt; Out of the 4-5 millions of people that will play Classic, only a small fraction will be from private servers, and even a smaller fraction will be hardcore players.
---
On top of that they are spread across the world. These servers will all be location locked. Separate NA/EU/Asia servers split those players to start, and then whatever servers they settle on split them again.
---
You don't have to be in a wannabe hardcore guild...unless you're a wannabe...
---
Totally agreed. Even the ambient sounds are beautiful.
---
It sucks because the best reason for Alliance to level a Night Elf is when rolling druid or hunter. Rolling hunter will have plenty of issues on its own.
---
So fuck it, I'll haul my Dwarf priest ass to Teldrassil just for the beauty.
---
True, I was thinking about that. I was thinking of duels, but I felt a duel wasn't PvP. Gurubashi Arena I guess would be considered PvP, but still a small and specific enough that I wouldn't include it in how Shaman perform in PvP
---
It will be magical AF and I'm super hyped but I also know it wont be the same as when I was 13...there's just no way.
---

Well good job being a douche about it. We would all be so lucky to be as skilled and try-hard as you. 
---
YEAHTHEYSHOULDLETUSPAYWITHMICROTRANSACTIONSTOMAKECHARACTERCHANGESWTFBBQ!!!!
---
But it's a re-release of an old game, so it would be fine to say "we're not supporting this 15 year old game to the same degree". I just don't see the downside.
---
Would some people get angry? Sure. So what? I cannot understand how this is a problem for blizzard.
---
You’re art is very provocative. It reminds me of Seb Mckinnon’s style.
---

---
I maxed got decently geared and quit over 8 months ago. It’s such a fun game even on a pserver but I didn’t want to invest anymore time into something that wasn’t permanent. 
---
Since they are using 1.12 as base, i doubt this will happen. 
---
It'll create work for something that players don't really care
---
The original response was to someone saying that shaman should heal a lot with chain heal and + healing gear. That's why I pointed out their utility versus healing numbers. I was speaking in the context of the thread not to you. As far as over healing goes, chain heal is easier not to over heal on versus other 2.5 second casts, but it still happens frequently due to the cast time being longer. That being said, I overstated how much it over heals.
---
What are issues with hunter? And don’t say low raid dps, that is private server kid talk.
---
It's more like people who read tabs instead of just playing. It's for beginners. The better you are the less you need to rely on someone telling you how to play.
---
When your tank says "wait here" in the middle of the bridge, you know he's a pro. 
---
Absolutely based 
---
Loved my female night elf warrior :) so much fun 
---
Sure, or you for this thing where you communicate with your friends :o
---
Don't trust anyone over level 30.
---
Extremely hostile in good guilds. 
---
I agree, and this "technology" or "service" is way overdue. MMOs should provide a list of servers with their population numbers, time zones, and faction balances before a person selects the server they want to be on.
---
Azshara isn't all that empty. The bay for fishing the reputation for mc, azurogos world boss. And it's not really a low level zone either. People farm felcloth there. Or stackable Grey's. No need for new dungoens. Keep it as it was. No changes all the way
---
I let my friends choose they all choose horde anyways. I don’t mind I played both a lot between vanilla and /bc 1-60 alliance nooblet 60-70 alliance nooblet. Then my bro started playing horde so 1-70 not a nooblet. 
---
They specifically said the reason they're implementing Loot Trading is because of GM tickets. It was in BlizzCon. I don't know where to find the quote.
---
I could try, but I've not played wow since WotLk and even then never a lock lol :/
---
I just came here to say I am hyped to play shaman in classic, played a pally back int he day. this time through will be wrecking with my Tauren Shaman =). very excited to get some WF crits while leveling in WPVP maybe 1/18 kills but still love it when it happens. and crank out some ele pvp end game.  
---
Also very excited to heal as shaman, I loved healing with my pally in Wrath more than anything (first time I tried a healer) cant wait to try another healer and get in on this chain heal action =P
---
oh yeah, that makes sense, I forgot you also had to pay for the game dvd discs at the start. 
---
I dont think that's true...most raids will bring up to 8 shaman, meaning you are rolling/using dkp against 7 others.
---
Things are gonna be different the leveling experience may be better in some respects and way worse in others. Hope you enjoy leveling. 
---
I play private server, I hope they do it as in vanilla so I can farm even more gold
---
Because this is a real problem, and loot drama causes people to leave the game. It may seem small if you only see it happen once, but it happens hundreds of times a day across all servers, and they solved the problem years ago with this trade mechanic. 
---
The problems people are thinking will happen were never really a problem when it came out, and the loot systems were functionally the same. 
---
You can't just say "So what" on things that will anger people and have always been done by blizz, because lost subs mean lost money and this needs to make a profit. If you want to see classic stick around, you need players. Pissing them off for no reason is counterproductive.
---
Divisions endgame was horrible I got about 50 hours of fun before the bs started. 
---
Overpopulation and low dps after AQ40.
---
It's my first main and favorite class btw.
---
Question is, do they gain more or lose more (players &amp; money) by developing classic further after some time. They view on this will most likely manifest in changes or nochanges. In the ene to appeal to all crowds I'd be fine with keeping classic realms and also setting up classic+ realms. To each their own and all are happy
---
I think if racials are a problem that needs fixing I'd rather they buff the weaker racials instead of nerfing the stronger ones. I know some people would prefer that the different races be strictly an aesthetic choice but for me I'd love if the racials really changed how you played with, as, or against each race.
---
Wait until you reach the char creation screen and see what feels right. :)
---
Paladin pairs well due to blessing of freedom, also very tanky wearing plate and has great heals. But you'll be more of a "healing turret"
---
Priest is also a good choice, you play a little more offensively, being able to dispel your warrior and the opposing team, as well as mana burn is potent. There's a tri spec for priests that gets imp mana burn, holy nova, and silence 
---
Low dps no. Still tier 1 on single target fights like twin emps and four horsemen. Top 5 in both in retail myself. More add fights in naxx which hurts but I plan to use engineer bombs to maximize dps and maybe get top 5-7 in those fights.
---
Spot on. Come for the nostalgia, stay for the surprisingly fantastic game.
---
Did you watch the video?
---
Cleave was mentioned for only over pulling and there was an entire section about grinding humanoids for cloth IRT first aid.
---
Maybe ninja'ing causes people to leave the game. This doesn't solve ninja'ing. Only solves people accidentally taking loot. Then again, ninjas aren't really a big problem.
---
Nobody is gonna leave quit WoW because some accidentally stole some blue in a dungeon, come on. 
---
I have a large group chat set up with ~15 of my friends who will be playing.  It's still moot if we can't decide in advance *"Hey, everyone roll on Burning Blade NA-E, horde side!"*
---
Clsssic isn't for anyone who is currently subbed, Blizzard should NOT be listening to the damn official servers. 
---
So, as long as you’re horde, and in AV, and at the bridge, and the enemy is not targetting you... you OWN their ass *once a minute*.
---
i call that a horde bonfire
---
Often the meme specs get turned away because they are just objectively weaker than other specs or cant do something that is required. For example, if a group is putting together a run and needs a dps with CC for the last spot, shammy druid pally dps are just out. If you find a good crew you can play what you like but as a pug player expect NOs if you go meme.
---
Do you think that those people from pservers that never played vanilla and come to classic might be disappointed with classic and the small differences?  We already saw some of this with the warlock pet thing.  Think pserver elitists might scoff at classic after a few months and go back?
---
This guy gets it.
---
I don't really remember his mechanics.  I guess when I fight him...***I'll have to improvise!***
---
That is a pretty hardcore way to make friends. Do you have to pay the ransom to keep the friend?
---
Something you need to really consider is that your spec can thrive or die based on the performance of the other 39 people a lot of the time. This boils down to a really simple problem. Mana. Mana is usually the back breaker of a lot of the "unviable" classes. Shadow priest, Ret paladin, Ele Shaman and so on. These classes can absolutely SHIT out the dps if they pump their mana out, but the downside is if you're shitting out dps and burning huge mana, then you need fights to be shorter, i.e high overall raid dps. The problem then occurs that you can't really blow through a boss without overgearing it. Obviously you can outperform the average, but above average raid dps with average gear is still not going to destroy a 5 minute average boss fight in 2 minutes. In my trials with these "unviable" classes, 2ish minutes seems to be the breaking point if you're maximizing your dps and mana expenditures, while using all instant mana recovery at your disposal. So its not really the spec itself that's unviable, its the timing of the spec concurrent with the timing of the raid that's unviable. I'm rambling a bit, but the short and simple version is that these mana dependant specs need more overall raid dps to shorten fights so they can perform to their maximum potential. How to do that at on par to content power levels is the question.
---
Maybe, just maybe we will get more info after a release date.  Worst case, launch day, chat with your buddies, tell everyone where y'all are going. 
---
Robe of Volatile Power is not a pre-raid item though.
---
Shut up. You need to be united in order to institute change. OP saying "we" is fine because most of the true Classic fans and even the majority of the sub don't want it. You can't approach a governing body with a petition for change if your movement is scattered and fragmented. Even if it's just an illusion, you have to present a united front.
---
&gt;However, I also know I can just add all that in via modding.
---
Alterations to models and textures, even just client side, is against the TOS.
---
People used to do it back in Vanilla days to give themselves Thunderfury, even though it only shows up client side, and they've gotten banned.
---
Play both, it's not like Classic is going anywhere when it's out.
---
Never played classic in 2004 and I played wow since 2009. on pservers (when wotlk launched). And in a year or so I found out about different versions of wow. Then I started to play on some and was having a lot of fun.Game felt different than wotlk (at least for me). And then, oh boy, came Nostalrius. Will never forget that feeling when I dinged 60. I took it casually and I loved it. Didn't rush until lvl 60. I was happy and every day I thought on playing wow. What I have to do, which dungeon quests should I do and dungeons etc. Idk I was happy and loved the game. Now I don't want to have a burnout so I am staying away from pservers.
---
Unless you're in a super elite nerd squad whose only goal in life is to excel in WoW... most people generally don't give a shit what you play.
---
The best argument against Loot Trading is that it's "neutral" and therefore unnecessary in a #NoChanges environment.
---
But then you have to address the cost of CM tickets for correcting misloots.
---
I think it's a small problem if we don't get a list before the release date, but I don't think it's pressing to have it *right now*. I would like to hear an official statement about what types of servers they will have, specifically if there will be RP and RP-PvP; but past that guilds and friends will be able to decide on a server at the very last second if need be. Just make a group chat or discord channel and have someone post what they're playing on, it's not like people are actually going to end up on different servers if they don't want to.
---
There was definitely a flat damage reduction element.... Not that reducing dot and crit damage wasn't already punishing enough. People in full TBC arena gear took less damage than prot warriors in PvE gear.
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/PvP_Resilience
---
"One percent of resilience reduces damage taken from all player attacks by 1%."
---
Elemental is a beast with gear and you will feel like a walking cannon. That said you will probably be switching specs a lot if you plan on raiding and doing PVP. If you just want to PVP you can probably find a decent Spec something similar to: [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hif0EcMqoVbfZx](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hif0EcMqoVbfZx)  
---
It should be noted that in Vanilla shamans were very versatile, allowing you to heal decently well without specing to far into it. Also you don't have to worry about healing if the enemies are dead.  
---
Also one of the greatest parts about Vanilla -&gt; Wrath is that the talent trees promote testing what works and feels good for you. There's min/max but I wouldn't worry too much about a few % boost unless you're trying to be world X.
---
No people generally quit because of raid misloots. It's a thing, seems stupid but it happens. Overall the trade system is not as bad as people make it out to be, and the problems are unlikely to occur because of social pressure. No guild wants to be known as "Those guys who all roll on stuff in pugs to give to their buddies" and nobody wants to be refused groups because they ninja using this system. Sure, they might get away with it, but it doesn't take many times getting caught before you are on a blacklist for most of the server. Wouldn't surprise me if someone had a mod to police this that scrapes the armory and tells you if they already have the item they roll need on.
---
&gt;I completely agree however that if its a client side change, that doesn't affect another persons gameplay or visuals, then by all means add it. 
---
You don't see an issue with this?
---
Imagine you're playing Second Life or VR Chat or the Sims. And someone can change how you look, if even on their client side.
---
In an RPG, can you not see the issue with this? Granted, modern Retail WoW is an Action game with multiplayer elements, but the classic Vanilla WoW was an RPG.
---
Many people chose the way they looked, their professions, their race, where they traveled, based on playing a role playing game, similar to Dungeons and Dragons.
---
Some of the modern Retail WoW models look significantly different, for example the undead faces.
---
There is very valid reason to argue against changing models even if it's "only client side" because it still affects how someone appears to others, and that's an important part of genuine MMORPGs.
---
I'm glad I went so hardcore on private servers so I can chill on classic. World bosses were so, sooooo awful that I won't join any guild that doesn't promise they won't try for them. Toxic alliance/horde back and forth for 6 hours, only for another alliance guild to make a deal with the horde guild and swoop in to take the boss after the alliance/horde wiped each other. 6 hours for 1 boss that didn't drop any BiS items.....
---
i think the concern comes from wanting to know, servers open at 8 am est (random time) and logging in quick, making your character quick, locking in your name(s) and starting to level to outrun the pack.  Not be on voice chat and people having to be like "ok what are the names, let's pick that one, go!" and waste any time.
---
That being said if everyone is on at the same time you could always just say "sort by name, sort by PVP, pick server #2" or something and everyone would still be the right one but it avoids issues if people know ahead of time.
---
But if you are managing an entire guild, making sure everyone rolls on the same one is the concern.  But I think with discord and modern technology it could work without an initial release but I think it would be nice still to know what server names / types / etc there would be beforehand. 
---
I was about to make a dark souls comparison as well. If you flawlessly execute the right tactics, any game is easy. 
---
Yeah, it's not impossible.  It would just be nice if we could coordinate it in advance is all.  It's not like ~1 week before launch the server names won't be decided anyway, I don't see what the harm is in making the names and regions public just so friend groups can get the word out.
---
Thanks a lot, I will check if I can find something from this website in archives.
---
"you dont need it as much but it is still the best profession to have."
---
when i say need i am talking about what you need to do if you dont want to be bad at this game.  any good guild will have all raiders use engineering so they can up their aoe trash packs, some boss fights will always have healers in position to use one (visc, frankis, nef, noth), and it is a must have for any pvp server.  if your raid doesnt have sappers another raid will gank your world buffs for laughs
---
there are other fights were you might find yourself in position to use one but those 4 will be used every time.  
---
Oh don't worry, they will be raiding -possibly with full BiS- before he's 60. Rushers really put the capital R in Rush.
---
Death Knight starting zone/sequence is my favourite out of all of them
---
Underperforming specs are not all equal. Some are borderline-weak, some are very bad.
---
And i expect some hardcore players going the gimp route and becoming good at it just so they can brag, but that’s exactly what they’re doing; gimping themselves.
---
They’re also not a valid group to generalize upon since most players are not pro nor shit; they’re in the middle.
---
I’m hoping that they might play around with a little balance, but more realistically they’ll probably leave everything as is and then just go into BC.
---
I love this because it's so different than your usual run of the mill female portraits that make up 99% of all submissions on r/wow.
---
You'll enjoy the first one, maybe. You'll absolutely loathe it after that.
---
So just make loot trading a thing only in 20/40 man raids? Seems like a simple solution again instead of forcing every 5man PuG to have loot trading available.
---
I've played Sham since ZG in Vanilla. Healing is insanely fun. There's some juggling with totems you'll have to get down but when it comes to Raid damage you'll feel great doing a chain heal or 2 and then focusing on tots. One of the hardest parts to learn as a shaman is mana utilization. You'll want to learn how squishy your raid is along with how quickly you run out.   
---
Down ranking your single targets to make them filler is great, along with being situationally aware. If you see a druid doing Tranq you probably don't want to just spam max rank CH.  
---
Totem twisting is also incredibly fun once you get the hang of it. It's like playing a game with HOTS or DOTS except yours give buffs.
---
I think that as long as you play knowing what to do with your class (like when in party, or istances) you can play casual as much as you want; and nobody can blame you for that =) 
---
It's code for "it was bullshit that someone could play 5 arenas a week and have better/the same gear than me for pvp". You're time invested and the gear you earn shouldn't be worthless in another part of the game. They should of either made PvP gear harder to earn/take more time or never have split the two.
---
If you want to play a game 2 hours a week and be as well geared as everyone, they've done that for you. It's called retail. It sucks, you belong there.
---
It's impressive how you just managed to *completely* miss the point.
---
&gt;you need to be united in order to institute change.
---
But people aren't necessarily united. An example that really shows is sharding. People are all over the place on what to do, yet we have posts saying "we don't want sharding". You can't speak for everyone when people don't agree.
---
&gt;You can't approach a governing body with a petition for change if your movement is scattered and fragmented. Even if it's just an illusion, you have to present a united front.
---
Are you serious? This is retarded. Yes, in order to make change it is much better to sound united instead of scattered. But think about *why* that is - it is because the governing body tries to help the majority. If it is just an illusion and people are scattered with different opinions you should most definitely ***not*** follow the "illusion". Then you cater to a minority.
---
You are essentially saying it's okay to use "we" even if people don't agree as long as it gets you what you want. That's fucked up.
---
You're completely missing the point. No one is against loot trading in a Master Loot situation, ie where this issue actually happens, even though it's a once-in-6-year instance.
---
And in dungeons with group loot, it should be a zero tolerance policy, no loot actions are taken.
---
That leaves us at *zero* customer service involvement. How many dollars per year is that exactly?
---
Alliance gets to level those tiny gross babies to kill Horde and /laugh at them.
---
The anger is delicious.
---
What exactly is this loot trading?
---
It's partly nostalgia but it's based on a genuinely great game.
---
Most everyone in my old vanilla guild quit "for good" sometime between TBC and Cata. We didn't like the game anymore and had no plans to ever play again, but were on a FB group to keep in touch.
---
A few of them began playing on Nostalrius and most of us laughed at the idea, mostly because of the rep. pservers had at the time. Then over a few months a bunch of us gave it a go and were really surprised how much we missed playing. A few of us even got sucked in further and even raided deep into the content for over a year.
---
The rose-tinted portion of my nostalgia is from the warmly naive and good-natured playstyle of the average gamer back then. How we would spend hours happily wiping in a dungeon where no one is there farming for an item, they're just there to have fun exploring the dungeon. Alterac will never be the same, people haven't truly PvPed in that BG since well before TBC came out. 
---
Overall the playstyle of people is night-and-day from what it was, and that hinders the complete recreation of that time period. And that largely has to do with everyone knowing everything inside and out. Suddenly that new player isn't allowed to spent days/weeks/months experimenting with dozens of ideas of how to play and hundreds of dungeon runs and weapons and armor and... nope - that's "fixed" by another player kindly informing them that their old hunter wore XYZ gear and you need to farm ABC dungeons, etc, streamlining the adventuring process and basically just creating a recipe list they need to fill.
---
Hey! I recently found all the screenshots I took during Vanilla. I thought I had lost them and was very happy and nostalgic after going through them. Might be interesting to you guys!
---
Yeah, got to 60 on 12x XP and got some gear in the shop and talking about “where I left off”. I’m the dick.
---
I think you got it backwards.
---
"Oldheads" remember a time in this game, when you logged in, and you did things, that did not reward you achievements, gear, mounts or transmog, instead you reward was *fun*. Some did RP, some did twink characters, and others just explored the world, none of this yielded anything in return, nothing tangible.
---
Modern young players do not know of a such a scenario in WoW, because the "fun" has been perverted to mean getting X in return. They grew up on achievement points in games, unlockables and extras, these are things that games from the 8 and 16 bit era rarely had.
---
Imagine playing a game like Super Mario Bros and the only "reward" is the fun you are having? Oldheads know about that, younger heads less so
---
Well yeah, starting zones is exactly what is up for discussion. They have never talked about using sharding all over Azeroth, only in starter zones in order to keep the realms decently lag free (which will still not be the case if you ask me)
---
When I created a character and logged in more than 3 years ago, I felt like I returned home. PS had their flaws (and lots of them), but the feeling is still magical.
---
Looking forward to farm Armory for Herod's Shoulders and Helm &lt;3
---
You're just so snotty about it, there was no need for your comment. It contributed nothing. 
---
BRS wasn't necessarily 5-man back then.
---
If your kid spills their drink at McDonald's you aren't entitled to a new drink but you can bet your ass they will give you one. You understand how people work, right?
---
I don't want to implement a system, you are the one arguing for changes from how vanilla was. I'm pointing out why they likely won't change a system based on your feedback because you haven't thought anything through.
---
You will get zero changes made to the game when you can't understand how business works, how customers work or even how other people think. If you are on the spectrum I apologize, but otherwise you need to stop acting like you are.
---
These are great, makes me a bit sad that I lost all my Vanilla screenshots years ago.
---
Find a leveling buddy a shaman is perfect or any hybrid or healer class. You both aren’t great damage dealers while leveling but together you can kill twice as efficiently. A shaman brings wind fury totem eventually and heals. My cousin and I duo leveled a shaman with herb/arch and warrior with mining/engineering on a pvp server. We could pretty much hold our own in most fights. Sometimes we were even the instigators. 
---
We might be old by now.  But we still have the decency to hel and teach new players. You dont have to work about that, just like you modern wow players would teach us If it was reversed 
---
It makes no sense to me that people do not want loot trading. I feel like that would give the game a fun economic strategy. Prices of items could be based off supply and demand. 
---
So you're saying that vanilla has the best community but you're also saying that if loot trading was enabled everyone would be a ninja? A bit contradicting don't you think.
---
Warriors may not be the first 60s but the early ones to max will pretty much be able to do whatever they want as long as they tank.
---
Yeah I know! I really thought I lost them forever and was sad as well. I recently went through an old drive and I was so excited when I saw I had a save there.
---
Except it's not a business... I get that the hardcore guilds would want top-end numbers but this is a video game. If you're treating it like a job I think you should rethink what you're doing.
---
I will be thrilled if people expecting a faceroll ragequit.
---
I feel like a great solution to this is to add a new loot type or a loot toggle. Allowing whoever is raid lead to opt into loot trading. This would allow it to be in the game in the case people actually wanted it, and would remove GM interference because if you did had out loot to someone by accident well you opted out of loot trading so sucks to suck.   
---
This would ultimately reduce "Ninjas" or rolling for gear you cant use etc. And would allow the players to decide. There's a huge issue most gaming companies have by now and it's removing player control to make the game "easier". 
---

---
Thank me later.
---
No you won't lol
---
Playing retail isn't so bad until that feeling of pointlessness and dissatisfaction sets in.
---
I have a lvl 5 troll rogue on a pserver but I can't be motivated to play. I worry about losing progress and that there arent so many people online and if I do make connections then I'll just lose them. (But that seems to not be the case and maybe people I meet will play classic too.)
---
Thing is I've never been interested in playing rogue. My favorite classes are Paladin, Shaman and Druid on retail but all of these classes are kind of suboptimal on classic. (I normally am a Protadin, but I'm happy playing DPS as well. I just dont want to heal.)
---
Eh, I think I'll see how much I can experiment so that I have a head start when classic launches. Maybe I'll make some friends so that I have a guild off the bat.
---
Lol. The entitlement is real
---
It is no coincidence that the early 2000s was when EA started destroying the gaming industry. Gaming became pretty damn stagnant after EA started buying up everything.
---
These posts aren't people worried about the actual experience, they're a backhanded way for people to try and shit on min/makers. Idk what's with the casual players inferiority complex.
---
Wait, what’s a ninja? How did that term even come about? Oh yeah, because there was no workaround for ninjas in classic. Some parts of the game can be disappointing and cutthroat, and very inconvenient. That is what makes vanilla so good. You ninja on a retail NA Server, one time in a level 20-40 dungeon...you might get away with it if you have a silver tongue. Do it more than once, though? And at higher levels? Word gets around, and it’s that level of community interaction, whether good or bad, that really makes the vanilla experience for players like myself.
---
Talk about throwing the baby out with the bathwater, jesus christ
---
Personally, I enjoy interacting with people in an MMO, especially those who play lots more than me and have trade-skill recipes I'll never see
---
If it makes you feel better I stopped read the comment you left after seeing doge. Good luck getting a personality outside dated memes.
---
Just give me an RP-PvP server pls 
---
You bitch about players pulling numbers out of their ass and then proceed to pull numbers out of your ass.
---
Who **doesn't** remember it? There was an actual scientific study done on it because it resembled how an epidemic would spread IRL. Even some non WoW players know about this. 
---
Any changes like this will give rise to private servers and diminish the “feels” that players want from their favorite game of the past. This is Vanilla, let’s stop trying to make it anything but Vanilla.
---
I will agree that Paladins were probably buffed too much during TBC (Mainly Protection AoE). Retribution was pretty terrible in both vanilla and TBC. Combat Rogues were one of the top DPS throughout TBC. The only pure DPS class that got hosed in TBC was Mage. Fury Warrior DPS was still amazing throughout TBC. If any healing spec was OP it was Restoration Shamans.
---
If you're feelings get so hurt by words that you'll quit playing a game, than the entirety of the internet is not for you, my friend. 
---
I'm sure you've come across offensive comments and been the target of others in your lifetime. The fact that you're posting on reddit is evidence enough that this statement is true. If you can deal with the internet trolls, you can deal with the WoWholes.

The main problem I have with Pservers is, that I remember how vanilla worked pretty well (as someone having autism, it's one of the pros of the condition). So when I run into places where there are discrepancies, it tends to ruin things for me. Most of the  time I can look past it, but once in a while something happens that completely kills the feeling for me. Escort quests in particular are completely botched on Pservers, and the way gathering nodes work is also particularly annoying to me (spawning in near-impossible places to get to, as well as despawning because of phasing changes when you move over a zone line). Mob AI also tends to ruin it for me (when murlocks backstab you from the front, I just shake my head at the game).  
---
But the underlying feeling of having an entire world to explore, and the game not discouraging you from playing at you pace, as well as inciting a feeling of wanderlust. That totally exists on Pservers, at least initially. There's just something about the Vanilla design that's great and timeless.
---
Private servers come very close to recreate the original feeling, more so prior to Nostalrius than post. The reasoning is that prior there could be 1-2 American/Chinese/Russian guilds on a back then fairly populated realm, hence the world really did go to sleep at certain times. Post there is just such enormous masses of players stacked on one realm that there is never really any downtime in the world, it's always buzzing for good and for worse.    
---
Regardless, it is still a great game in both scenarios - I just have the personal preference that I started playing classic due to the constant instant gratification and masses of players found on live servers (sharding, cross realm zoning etc), and that very much creeped back with Nostalrius hence I'm waiting for Classic.
---
You act like you got it all figured out, yet you are dead wrong. It's almost laughable how your example does ***not*** translate to this situation.
---
Your McDonald's example has no downside. Loot trading isn't just helping some people, it impacts a lot negatively.
---
So take your McDonald's example again. What it really should be like is this; your kid spille their drink at McDonald's so they take the drink from some other costumer and gives it to the kid.
---
Now, do *you* understand how people work? Yes, you pleased the kid and maybe the parents, but you just took away from someone else. This would ruin McDonald's.
---
And taking it back to Classic, loot trading is, as you even mentioned yourself, a fix so people won't ragequit after not getting a piece of loot. Have you seen WoW forums? There are always ragequitters. They will find anything to quit over, if it isn't that piece of loot it's something else. It's not worth changing your game to try and cater to them. Essentially you are saying Blizzard should try and help the unreliable customers instead of the stable ones that will be by their side for years. Yet you act like you know anything about business?
---
Lmao They're like spoilt children. Gotta reward the good behaviour!
---
Won’t what? I’ve already done it in retail with my guild.  Look at dps meters at end.
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HUzWiQF1fMg
---
And I could have min maxed much much better than I did in retail during that kill.
---
This. All of this 
---
&gt; But you're no longer a walking nuke coated in adamantium. Dying is a common part of the game. Spending three hours in a dungeon only to lose the roll on that item you came for is.. devastating.
---
This.
---
So much this.
---
I would like to add to this.
---
Character Progression:
---
Right from the start you get the sense of your character getting stronger. Of course this is hard to recreate in expansions, and Blizz attempted this by doing gear resets...but I feel hard resets with gear did more harm than good in the long run.
---
Gear overall in Vanilla played a big role in the feeling of strong progression. Upgrades were harder to come by, gear was unique and varied and it overall felt far better getting a new piece of gear. You weren't  chasing a higher item level. 
---
I think Vanilla offered a more sandbox approach than what we have today. Everything is became linear and on rails, while vanilla allowed for a bit more freedom on how you could progress your character in a meaningful way. 
---
you can kill the bosses but you wont be top 5 dps with hunter
---
Mr Smite FUCKS
---
There is a really fun tri spec build for priests that lets you pick up imp mana burn, fear cdr, holy nova, and silence. Those along with MC/MV the offensive/defensive dispel and pw:s make for a very potent healer in bgs.
---
I mained rogue from vanilla to now. I played swords, daggers, HARP, cata/mop sub (prob my favorite) and all the current awful specs designed by a guy who played WoW on a tablet (Celestalon). I didn't play rogue past Nost because they are simply bad in a lot of content and or not flexible. The same people you can troll on a rogue you can kill faster on a warrior while also being able to tank for guildmates, be the best dps/pointman due to Mstrike in BG's. The exceptional players that can beat you on the warrior usually don't bother because they know you can make their life a living hell because all the healers who you got BIS are your boys. 
---
I don't hate rogues. I love rogues. They are my favorite class to play. Warriors are simply A LOT better in 1.12. I didn't choose this patch. 
---
Oh so you're speaking for me then? Please don't do that.
---
You’re putting words in my mouth. I don’t recall posting “vanilla has the best community.”
---
I would argue that the systems (or systems lack thereof) in vanilla create the environment for a better community. Mainly due to the need for communication, unlinked servers meaning the population isn’t always randomizing, and you reputation on that server lasting. 
---
But even granting you that small point, your argument is flawed. A community =/ a person. Any community is going to have bad agents. The community wouldn’t endorse ninja’ing (as evidenced of the community trying to stave off ways to enable it), but a person given an opportunity to better themselves at the sake of others (when they otherwise wouldn’t better themselves but gain positive standing among their peers) would. 
---
Regardless, I have friends joining me in July. I’m excited for the game whether there is loot sharing or not, but I would like to see it removed and blizzard actually spend money on employees (the main reason they want to use it, to cut down on tickets/hiring more GMs) 
---
That is how it is in most MMOs. You see these elitists making posts all the time online but you rarely see them in game because they create bubbles that only other elitists enter.
---
That's not the issue at all. His solution solves the issue 100%. 
---
\&gt;  Not casual begging for hand outs, more like doesn't always feel up to making the game into a second job. 
---
It's called being a casual but not a scrub.
---
I wish my GF was more interested in this but she'll never be interested. FML
---
How much dps did that hunter have on that clip?
---
If it is strictly for dungeons you are probably solo-healing and so you wont really benefit that much from spirit cause of the 5-sec rule and you can drink in between fights while the group does CC etc. I’d say this:
---
+Healing
---
Mp5
---
Intellect
---
Spirit
---
I don't mine will stick around unless I'm there helping, once she's level 60 she may become self sufficient.
---
F for respects, sir 
---
Great pictures of the journey man, thanks for sharing.
---
My guess: you won't skip it. 
---
And since you do have less spirit then. Would you consider a Power Infusion specc instead? Or go for the 21/30/0 holy specc? 
---
&gt; We can only try to work towards an acceptable outcome for all of us through discussions.
---
Don't forget the reeing. If you ree enough, and loud enough, changes can happen. 
---
Legion, Ion: 'Warlocks don't need to start with soul shards when entering combat; we gutted your spell list; and you are balanced around your artifacts weapons, heavily.' 
---
Lock forums: 'Reeing will commence and continue until changes are made.'
---
&gt;Queue 3 months of non-stop reeing about all the shitty Warlock changes.
---
Ion in Dev stream: 'Locks will now start combat with shards, and we acknowledge that we messed warlocks up and have no idea how to fix them.'
---
I liked Ion looking miserable in that Dev stream. 
---
We don't know because it hasn't been clarified, and that's why all these future ninjas are freaking out. 
---
Well I also want to play the game, so there's that.
---
But their behaviour really is like that.
---
Then perhaps you should learn how to use reddit and reply to the OP instead of the person you did...
---
this was beautiful, not gonna lie. thanks for sharing! i’m even more hyped about classic now lol
---
I haven't heard him say that line in a decade, but I still can hear it clear as day in my head.
---
This has made my entire day. 
---
&gt; In PvP a balance Druid can put a whole team on blast with their aoe 
---
*what?*
---
Even those of us who have played since 2004 hate it when anyone taints the experience with toxic behavior, it doesn't matter how long you've played.
---
Some people are jerks, some are unhelpful, some are rude, and some lack patience. The worst players are usually entitled teenagers and college-age kids who unironically act like the guy from [pure pwnage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqWFYOxjZ54). The oldest players I've played with were amongt the most generous and thoughtful, glad to assist folks new to the game. While the most angsty and toxic were the 20'something kids without anything else in their life outside of Azeroth, who nolife WoW and scream at those around them as if it's their cognitive dissonance.
---
I wouldn't worry about it, the game is very forgiving, and people are very kind to new players.
---
i play in horde but i start as night elf , and that place is my favorite music, and colors of this map is amazing!
---
This literally made my laugh out loud. 5/7 meme
---
At least the dam will be back again once Classic WoW comes out.
---
Wont word also get around if you are abusing loot trading?  How is it any different.
---
I disagree with your points. Painting and driving takes a lot of knowledge. Also you contradict your original point with what you said about pvp. 
---
Xfire.. Oof.. I remember all my old friends ;___;
---
That was me, I don’t remember it’s been 14 years. 
---
Who is holding hands in Classic?
---
Regardless the 1% proves it can be done they prove that other people lacked the mental stamina to push to do the content.
---
Levelling and wPvP is what I'm looking forward to most!
---
In 4 horsemen I was because it’s a good boss for hunters. It depends on the boss fight not raid as a whole.
---
Yep.  Im actually really looking forward to seeing those old zones again...along with the Park District, Darkshore, the salt flats, all of Tanaris, etc.
---
Can u avoid his stun via dying and brez waiting to accept the Rez after the stun? I always wanted to figure out how to get around the stun 
---
Hogger raids
---
I want loot trading. I want to be able to roll on gear and give it to my friends. It's fun. 
---
You appear to be one of the few people who likes the idea of constant 10k population.  
---
Having this many people online all the time makes the game much different from what it used to, and I personally know people who stayed away from private servers for that exact reason.  
---
Dynamic respawns present a bunch of other issues you failed to mention:  
---
* People abusing instant respawns for experience and resources.  
---
* People unable to complete quests in caves and choke points due to insane respawn rates.  
---
Neither sharding nor dynamic respawns are good options in my opinion. However, Blizzard might decide to implement one of them for the starting zones. If I were a betting man, I'd bet on them going with sharding over dynamic respawns.
---
This is a small indie company we're talking about here.
---
Loot trading to me really only works within the constructs of individualized loot.  I dont really even see the purpose of it for group loot.  With that said, i am in the camp thats largely indifferent.  I dont think people will abuse it any more than people ninjaloot. 
---
Beautiful
---
How come? Is it because quest areas for alliance during that time is mighty inconvenient?
---
Haha. Night Elf Druid for me, in Stonetalon Mountains. Probably around level 24 or something. My heart was beating so fast and hard I could hear it. What a rush, for something so inconsequential in reality x) But man was the tension of PvP real at the start.
---
Im a rogue and i find this funny, TAKE MY KARMA!
---
Dont forget to credit the artist when you post, there is alot more beautiful wow art where that came from. [Source](https://www.deviantart.com/eepox/gallery/).
---
If you dont know where it came from, just right click the picture and google search it, it usually tells the tale. 
---
I hope we can be a healthy sub that give content creators the credit they deserve.
---
im not saying that i and most others cant handle rude comments online. but if you were to go into a space online full of elitists not really ideal to have fun. honestly, my main concern with the possible elitism in classic wow could spark more extreme action from Bliz like how they did wit Overwatch soooo
---
Good luck. The more information Blizzard shares about servers the greater dichotomy there will be between packed servers and empty ones. No one wants to play on an empty server. Publishing information like this would just give the entire community the chance to plan ahead and focus exclusely on 1-2 servers rending the rest useless. It'll hurt everyone. 
---
Could you explain the term "bindings to a priest" to a new player? I'm not familiar.
---
I have an INSANELY good story. I was im stv looking for lvl 60s ganking lowbies. I was a 60 hunter with t2 and the xbow from Bwl with a pvp spec and suddenly the Zg buff poppes. I already had lots of buffs up and sat on 6.5k hp ish. Suddenly a guildie whispers me to come to SW lm he was running around in Elwynn Forest and spotted a horde group summoning more and more people, and as a rogue he did the natural thing and stealthed to spy on them. He reported approximetly 30-40 horde and said they were moving towards SW. We gathered as many people as we could in this short time frame and stood ready at the gates. Suddenly 30 horde rush in, but they didnt know we were ready. We slaughtered every single one of them before they even could pass the gates. 
---
The best part came afterwards. Some lowlvl reported that the horde were regrouping in eastvale logging camp. We were a group of 6 geared people who ran down there. We ambushed them and litteraly 6v20ed em. I had constantly like 3-4 people on me. All of them was lvl 60 but to be fair some of them had ress sickness, but I swear it was so epic seeing we were so few and killed sooo many. One of the best experiences ever. 
---
This and only this.
---
Dev time, bugs, and customer service concerns. They won't pay for CS, this system is already in the base client they are working with.
---
It doesn’t matter how often loot was ninjad back then, or how people dealt with ninjas. If loot trading is in Classic, the circumstances will be entirely different. The mentality and approach towards loot, dungeons, and upgrades will be different than it was. Even if for some reason you think having this system in will be better than GMs just not answer mis-loot tickets for some reason, the fact that it is so different from what there was back then should be reason enough to not put it in.
---
I love loch Modan as well. Has a good happy bright vibe to it. 
---
Vanilla had loot trading, just took GM time and took a few days. This is not a change, but rather the modern way to do what vanilla had. They won't pay for GM's, fact. They don't want to change their stance on loot fixes, fact. Trading is in, it's the easy way.
---
rogues are downvoting the shit out of this
---
I hadn’t considered original Deadmines coming back. Man I loved that instance. I may have to resub for classic after all.
---
If you tank him far from his chest the stun will expire before he finishes running to his chest back, giving everyone time to heal up n shit.
---
Well, you have 50% chance of making the right choice and 100% chance making the wrong choice by choosing Alliance. Now use your math skills to see which side you should roll. (No pressure on you i assure!)
---
i suppose you are right about me confusing terms, i am kind of imagining what i encountered my early days of private servers and light casual playing in wrath and before. elitists are necessarily bad, they ARE elitists for a reason. because they are good at the game/knowledgeable! Dickbags are what to worry about.
---
Honestly I wouldn't mind if they just said that they weren't going to handle any misloots and all and if it happens you just gotta deal with it. Would really rather have that than have loot trading.
---
It’s a small problem to not know server’s physical location before hand? 
---
Female nightelf, AHAHAAHAHAHAHHAHAHA
---
Hahaha I just found the meme format to be so fitting I couldn't pass up the opportunity to make it
---
&gt; only in starter zones
---
That's false. What they have said is ESPECIALLY at launch and in the EARLY zones.
---
I'm a little late to the party but there's a very fun tri spec pvp build for priests and gets you imp mana burn, holy nova, fear cdr, and silence. Put r1 mind flay on your bar for slowing as well and your utility as a healer is unmatched.
---
Yeah. Give and take man. Sounds like a healthy relationship 
---
Unlike "I'm banned cos I have a gf".
---
Aren't there diminishing returns on honour received from the same player?
---
Ahh yeah good point, I overlooked that point. No need to have such an attitude though mate! I was just curious. 
---
As much as I despise your notion, god damn do i admire your courage 
---
This is actually the reason I’m excited about playing Horde this time around. I really only ever played Alliance, and there was so much about the Horde world I know absolutely nothing about so it will be a first time experience for me. 
---
Maybe you shouldn't 'farm' world bosses, but just play regularly, and whenever they spawn and people request your help, you get there, have a pvp fight and kill that dragon with whichever guild that tagged it.
---
Stop crying you reddit nerd
---
People rolling need on an item, and giving a 2 hour window where they can trade it to anyone else who was in the group when it dropped.
---
ohh ok.  That's stupid
---
There was always a dichotomy of skill. I started when I was 11, raiding with grown ass adults (our guild leader was a college professor, my best friends in game were a mother of two and an African American body builder from Cali, etc.) and I wasn't even a particularly smart 11 year old. I played a Boomkin and had to be walked through the simplest things. I became really good and an overall asset because I was willing to learn and help. That's all oldheads want to see. The concern should be with min/maxers, but their number will be reduced because it's all been done before and won't be as impressive again. 
---
Don't worry he pulled a number out of his ass that was 10x bigger than the number he bitched about
---
&gt;You fabricated a reality to support your personal desires. You painted the people who want the thing you don't want as boogeyman with foolish, self-centered goals in order to make them seem foolish. From there it is implied that only a fool would want the same things as them. 
---
I don't know where you're getting this from. I played extensively on both Nostalrius and Elysium. I think basically all the changes that they made are good. 
---
1) I think a progressive content release with frozen 1.12 is vastly superior to just releasing an actually blizzlike 1.12 server with all the content out. I think a blizzlike 1.12 (meaning all the content is out at release) would be a game that is dead on arrival. 
---
2) I think the much higher than blizzlike pop (2k compared to 5k+) is great and builds a much better community. The world feels so much more alive as you go around it (with great opportunity for WPVP), and you're much more able to put together groups to run whatever instances you want. (I also like the international aspect where there's players on at all hours)
---
3) I think the supporting changes to make 1.12 work really do work well. Some mechanics (like old Onyxia conflagrate) were kept to make raid encounters feel a bit more difficult. There's also good evidence that boss armor and resist was increased on private servers compared to how it was in 1.12. We know for a fact that C'thun is significantly overtuned in this respect, in particular.
---
4) I also think that the dynamic spawns (as well as changing up various gathering node locations) is needed to make such a high pop server work, and with some exceptions (like caves) really does a lot more good than harm. 
---
5) I also think that the diremaul gold nerfs were needed to combat gold inflation (and I seriously hope Blizzard implements this). 
---
SO yeah, you're totally off base accusing me of calling these people fools for getting what they want. I wouldn't really call them fools because I ALSO WANT CHANGES, IN FACT MOST OF THE PRIVATE SERVER CHANGES. 
---
The distinction is where you draw the line. 
---
No-Changer's line is "yes, I'm all for changes, but only the changes from Vanilla WoW -&gt; Private Server style. Anything else crosses the line." 
---
And I say back to them "Yes, I agree with you that the a bunch of the changes made to private servers allowed us to end up with an improved version of Vanilla WoW. And yes, I recognize that there is definitely a safety in old adopting these changes, because they've been tested and shown to work on private servers. But, I don't draw the line there - we have at least decent evidence from TBC that certain spec rebalancing would work, and I think we should do that."
---
The classic no-changer response is "Yeah, again, I just don't trust blizzard to make such balance changes without going overboard and destroying the game." This is just a difference of opinion.
---
But you're just totally wrong to say I'm painting them "as a boogeyman with foolish, self-centered goals", or that "only a fool would want the same things as them." Because these are largely goals I SHARE, and I STRONGLY support their goals over something that would actually be blizzlike (again the 1.12 with everything out). 
---
&gt;And you just happen to want something different.
---
Yes, I do want something different. I want balance changes. But my position can't be they're wrong for wanting what they want. Because the crux of my argument is that what they want is Changes, not what is Blizzlike. But I also want changes. If you're right, my stance would be "Haha look at these idiots who want changes... Anyways, the changes I want are..." That would be preposterous. 
---
&gt;It's good political maneuvering. Sad to see it upvoted here, but that means it was at least moderately effective.
---
I'd ask you to consider what I wrote and reflect on whether you still believe this. You seem to be operating on certain incorrect presumptions about me, or my stance towards private server players. These probably put a gloss on what I wrote and prevented you from seeing what I actually intended. I'm happy to discuss the topic more with you if you're interested.
---
2/3 of my main classes are rogue and warrior. Idk how to feel.
---
The raids aren't mechanically challenging until Naxx (and even then it's mostly because of gearchecks and squashing 40 people in small spaces)
---
With that said, the journey is what makes classic magical. I *WANTED* to log in every day because there was always something interesting happening. In retail land, "humm no emmisarries or WQ's I wanna do *logoff*"
---
It really isn't that complicated. Listen to the casuals and your game goes to shit fast with all the QoL changes and just general dumbing down of the game. 
---
It won’t be quick when gearing a character. Remember raid bosses only drop like 2-3 items, while there are 40 players in a raid. Maybe warriors will be quickest because groups need a geared tank. Any tank class probably will be priority and warriors were always top. 
---
Woah. Let’s take a step back here. Vanilla did not have loot trading. 
---
I understand that you’re trying to boil GM tickets for loot-related issues down to loot trading. But the method that is being purported is not something that was in Vanilla. I don’t play on Retro WoW. I don’t want a LFG interface in vanilla because “it made finding a group more convenient.” 
---
I love the fact that loot was super coveted in Vanilla and that as a player you learned to cherish the loot that dropped and not to instantly need on any item. 
---
You CANNOT get away with repeatedly ninja’ing gear in vanilla, and the playerbase are very conscious about who is in the group for what gear etc. 
---
This is part of vanilla. Vanilla is not the latest expansion of WoW. Why is there even a mention of this? 
---
Just a remember, we did not have any list in vanilla. You want #nochange? Do 3 alts on multiple servers to reserve your name until you guild leader decides on which server you have to connect. Or be on a msn messenger group with all you friends to decide, at midnight...
---
Been there, done that ^^
---
I would like to know which data centers these are hosted in. I'm very close to Chicago and would love to nab a Chicago data center
---
I'm going in with my SO of 5 years. She had never played an MMORPG , so to determine if it was something she would enjoy playing we hopped on a P.S. and leveled all the way to 60 as a Mage/Prot warrior combo by grinding dungeons all the way to 60. - Slow way to go for sure, but was a ton of fun.    
---
Discovered she really enjoyed it, and now we're collectively pumped for classic.
---
Reported.
---
Yes as someone else said, it opens up to massive ninja looting problems. Where people are just going to need on a piece of gear, as loot locking ISN'T a thing (you can only roll on a piece of gear for your class, leather only for druids/rogues, plate for warriors/paladins, etc.), as many BIS pieces for healers are cloth. As such loot locking won't work.
---
So having no loot trading would be a smarter idea in the long run, to prevent mass ninja looting. And there's a large portion of the community against it.
---
Personal responsibility? In 2019?! REEEEEEEEE, stop oppressing people! Forcing people to deal with the consequences of their actions is a micro-aggression and I won't stand for it!!        
---
          
---
Seriously though, I agree. People *will* make mistakes in looting, and it *will* suck for them. That makes it a fantastic reminder to be even more cautious in the future. The sum of our experience is successes and failures, even the ones we're embarrassed about.
---
I think you misunderstand that this guide is only meant for those who are rushing to 60 on launch when there is no one else to craft these items in the first place. I'm not sure if you know, but the mats from the vendor are in limited quantity and stock infrequently.
---
Me make unwarranted aggressive comment.
---
haha. me comical.
---
*pounds chest and grunts laughter*
---
Nah they’re just bad.
---
They have been theory cited for over 10 years, you aren’t suddenly going to figure something out that works.
---
Unfortunately I dont have that information. It will vary per race. However, I can assure that buying a wand off the auction house will be significantly cheaper than making your own after launch.
---
Things viable for loot trading can already be rolled for.
---
Why not just leave it the way it is?  If someone needs on something they can use, or clearly something for a different class, then kick him. 
---
Yea, that is kinda the point of the post though. It does take forever so we can try to at least give ourselves an advantage. I honestly couldn't imagine being a mage with 7 others all going to for the same gear. 
---
I find this idea better than the existing one. But for me personally, nothing will change my mind - If Blizzard don’t want to deal with GM wasting time on loot-corrections, then I wish they just keep the original loot system (need/greed etc.) and give a statement or w/e that they will never ever -what so ever- correct loot, even if it was an honest mistake or not. 
---
This way people will know what they sign up for. And also, if you get ninja’d, that person will most likely get his reputation ruined and he will have a much harder time getting groups for dungeons etc. Cuz reputation in Classic will be a huge deal, just as it was during Vanilla. This concludes that GM intervention won’t even be needed. 
---
two halves that drop needed to create https://www.wowhead.com/item=19019/thunderfury-blessed-blade-of-the-windseeker 
---
a good threat generator for tanks (warriors), giving a binding to a priest would be a huge waste as the bindings are rare.
---
The only reason to get exalted with a faction is if the faction is not your own, and you want to buy one of their mounts. Example: You're an Orc and your faction mount is the Riding Wolf, but you want one of the cool Troll Raptor mounts, but when you go to try and buy one the Troll mount vendor says "No way Mon". If you want to buy a Raptor mount, you would have to gain exalted status with the trolls, then you can buy a Raptor mount from them....but you will still only get 10% discount on the price, because the only price discount you get is 10% and that's at honored rep.
---
So to sum up: If you're gaining rep just to get a lower price for your faction mount, then honored is all you need.
---
Why are we advocating for changes to the game?!? 
---
Shortly after TBC dropped I stopped playing WoW, because most of the magic of the game was lost for me. The vast majority of that magic was the lack of convienence, and ingame features (or lack thereof) that forced you to socialize and communicate with other players. Any step in the direction of modern “QoL” convience pandering moves me away from going into retail vs. a private server that tries to maintain the integrity of the original.
---
"Any scenario you come up with where a group uses LT to screw you over can be rephrased as a scenario where the same group thwarts a ninja"
---
I disagree, what if you are a rogue and running with 4 other people all friends who roll need on everything to funnel gear. How do you thwart a group of 4 ninja's?
---
Pro tip: don’t try to fight mr smite. Just let him kill you.
---
It’s easier that way.
---
You got me, I had an angry response all fired up lol.
---
Another solution is to not have it, then the non problem solved.
---
Is it though? Honestly, how many of us remember 6 hour dungeon runs in places like ST or BRD? The game can be easy when things go right, but your average dungeon is much more punishing than retail if people make mistakes. Pulling adds, falling in the wrong places, etc. There's a lot that can go wrong. Once you find good tanks and healers you tend to befriend them because they make an enormous difference.
---
There I put it as a reply to the OP...but I also left it as a reply to you too because your tears are delicious
---
Sure, I wouldn’t be surprised if the player-base create and popularise some kind of item level/gear score add-on, or a Classic version of raider.io, or a dungeon finder add-on. I expect the conveniences of current WoW to be carried over via add-ons, and stuff like that will definitely ruin the experience.
---
While there will be a toxic portion, I think they will be drowned out by people legitimately trying to enjoy the game.
---
I have played on a number of classic servers, after playing classic wow while I was in high school-&gt;college. And classic STILL draws me back. I played on Kronos, Elysium, Light's hope where many of the toxicity resides and I still found myself logging in every day. In the end, it's who you surround yourself with, which will dictate if you will have fun or not.
---
There won't be a LFG (hopefully) queue, so we will be *FORCED* to talk to each other. That will put more emphasis on player relationships and helps weed out toxic guilds/people. 
---
Beyond the usual people making jokes when people ask for help, there will be people flocking to help as always. Try asking where Mannarik's wife is in the barrens for a good time.
---
Use google, it's in one of the interviews from back when classic was originally announced
---
How does this fix what most people are complaining about at all? The biggest problem with loot trading is that 4 friends can queue with one random, roll on a piece of gear and win it so they can trade it with a friend to ensure they get it and not the random. Regardless as to whether or not they have 4 hours or 5 minutes, they still achieve their goal. Even if you get chat logs that show the trade, it still happened and won’t stop people from doing it
---
Really a non-issue, dont you guys have phones?
---
I like how the wording of the proc makes it sound like all 3 targets will be damaged the same, not that it casts a chain lightning
---
I assume it's from thier experience on private servers. They are quickly going to realize just how shitty private servers are actually compare the the real deal.
---
What if you are one of the 4 friends and the rogue is trying to ninja a drop?
---
World bosses work that way maybe 1 time out of 100.
---
" You ninja on a retail NA Server, one time in a level 20-40 dungeon...you might get away with it 
---
I think you have retail and classic mixed up, in retail wow you will be playing with people on different servers, chances are you can ninja all the way from 15-120 and no one will remember you. In classic wow you try that shit and word will get around in World, LFG and City chat when you are LFG. 
---
I certainly offered to pay people to pass on the item I wanted if it dropped back in vanilla. Nothing new. 
---
If blizzard forces loot trading onto us, I'd at least like to catch those who abuse the system. 
---
&gt; 'm sure Mythic and possibly Heroic raids are way harder than Nax
---
I'm sure mechanically so, but the time investment to get 8 tanks geared up for four horseman is enormous and a mind boggling challenge in itself. 
---
If that happens to you then you'll know that you're in the wrong crowd. There'll be plenty people with whom you can do stuff with without messing with you.
---
Don’t bubble on pull
---
Flash and greater ( downranked) 
---
Maybe renew if aow
---
So true. I just explained to a friend last week how, in classic, while you’re leveling, you inevitably see someone on horde or alliance that is leveling at the same frequency over and over, and you develop a rivalry with that specific player for grinding zones, quest mobs, etc. only possible without sharding. One of my favorite parts of WoW classic was that your server was unique due to its community, not the game.
---
Fuck, he fuckin FUCKS
---
Good post OP, but you forgot that we also need transmog carry-over from retail. I'm not going to have the time to get full tier 1 again, and in 2019 cosmetics are more important than mechanics. They sell the game. So I need to be able to mog my stuff from tier one from my retail account. :P
---
&gt; When 
---
And it's always a matter of when, not if. There will be lots of mistakes and lots of wipes. It's just the nature of the game.
---
Sorry, I meant “Retail Classic,” when I think of WoW I really only care about classic.
---
I don't think they should change the game if they can avoid it. Not knowing the server names in advance is part of the authentic experience. 
---
Watched the whole thing :) really enjoyed those memories
---
How does the "no changes" system stop Ninjas?
---
It doesn't. 
---
What's /r/wowclassic/ if it's not made for that ?  
---
 Do not feel obliged to answer if you do not have the required skills.   
---
Anyway, thanks for your kind help ;-)  
---
I see what you mean. But just as a piece of information, you never wanted to gear mages. They did too much damage and threat to begin with. Even with 30% threat reduction the crits they put out would often pull aggro 
---
Classic servers didn’t have 10k people on them though, right? That’s just a private server thing. I’m not saying mob competition won’t exist in classics rerelease but if servers only have 3k (might be wrong on that number) like they used to, the issue won’t be nearly as extreme except in select areas 
---
This is some low effort shit mate 
---
He didn’t even put the icon over the gun, what kind of scrub shit is that 
---
Thanks for the answer, it helped me a lot !
---
Seems like the smallest of problems.  If you and your friends want to be on the same server just talk to each other.
---
Sharding would be fine for the first few weeks but it completely ruins it for me if they are going to keep it. It would be gamebreaking.
---
Keep in mind a ninja is obvious to the group. It's very clear when someone ninjas something.
---
With loot trading its far more insidious. Ex I get into a upper Blackrock Spire group as a Mage and my friend Warlock is there. I know the best in slot (pre-raid) helmet called Spellweavers Turban drops from the last boss. Almost every caster is going to want it. Let's say I have a better item from raids. I either throw on a green item I have laying around, buy one from the Ah or use a spare I had in my bank, or my friend throws me something to wear. If the turban drops, my friend now has twice the chance to obtain it. Nobody will know that I essentially just ninjaed an item. It's completely anonymous. That's the real issue.
---
I can because I've done it before. I hid in the water in AB a few times in front of the blacksmith and waited for the horde to move on, kill their defender and claim the bs. I was no longer able to do that after the new water effect was added in cata because you can quite easily see through it. If you know how to use the terrain to your advantage there's lots of possibilities. Especially in world pvp
---
Gm tickets for loot is the same thing. Loot is not less valuable because you can trade for a limited window with people in the group. The point is that they will not pay for the GM time, and this is how you fix the constant misloot issues without GM's. 
---
You make my point for me when you say you can't ninja without people being pissed and trying to sham you in public for it. This is the same deal, if someone was to abuse it they would have real issues finding groups. Especially now in an age of blacklist addons and outside game forums where you can name and shame. 
---
True, let's hope  there will be similarities.
---
You sound like you say you want it, but you don't want Classic enough to even pay the sub fee, and you're looking for excuses to keep pirating. 
---
It does though. If you can’t trade the gear with a friend and can’t use it yourself, rolling on the piece only hurts your friend, not help them
---
Not in the game, beside HKs and DKs.
---
There used to be addons to track how many times you had killed various people in a day, since eventually it bottoms out once you kill them a bunch. I forget the name, but  here was another one that tracked *everything*, even the raw damage you dealt since level 1, or overall deaths you had incurred and which mobs or players you died to.
---
If you want to raid 2 days a week, you shouldn't have better pvp gear than someone who pvps every single day. While PVP gear might have been too easy to get in TBC, it's way too hard to get pvp epics in vanilla, not comparable at all to the raiding route.
---
PI-spec is pretty bad for healing if you're only in dungeon/low tier raiding gear and it only really becomes useful when you have the +healing to make up for the lack of holy talents. It will in no way increase your healing since it's only used for buffing mage/warlock dps in raids. 
---
I would go for [this spec](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxRhsV0oZfLxcc0Vx) both in dungeons AND raids. Spirit is really, really good for holy priests since it doesn't just increase your mana regen while casting (with the meditation talent), it also increases your +healing. 
---
The more +healing you have, the more you can downrank your spells and save mana. I wouldn't bother looking for intellect but rather look for what has the most +healing. Intellect should just come with the gear really.
---
If you want to know how mana efficient your heal is, just divide the amount it heals for with the mana cost. That way you can see what rank would work the best with the amount of +healing that you currently have. The higher the mana efficiency is, the better.
---
\+Healing&gt;Spirit&gt;mp5&gt;intellect.
---
It's a possibility, when people ninja things that reputation tends to follow them for a long time, and there are no name changes or server transfers in classic. (And hopefully they stay gone for the classic servers! Reputation means a lot)
---
I think it's mostly fear from people. If Blizz changes one thing, they are going to make 100 other small changes and make it BFA 2.0. 
---
Me I don't really care that much. If I am hunting something specific, I am going to run with people I know, or with a guild and target that piece if it's THAT important to me. And I am sure people will do the same, (screw reserved runs those are the downfall of the server) just talk to people and try to get people together who want X instance and aren't after the same piece, or are willing to farm until everyone has what they need.

Tbh all i want is insta-60 tokens.

I almost responded after reading the subject and first sentence without reading the full post because I was immediately angry. Then I literally lol'd when I got to the bottom of the post. You got me good. 
---
Am I the only  one that hated playing in those zones?
---
Or we just keep telling them no loot trading.  They might listen.  They have shown they are receptive.
---
Thanks for sharing!
---
&gt; ere used to be addons to track how many times you had killed various people in a day
---
IIRC titanbar (specifically titan honor) tracked players killed since you logged in. And honor gained from them.
---
thank you! I hope that one day I may be able to get close to that level with my own stuff :)
---
Dude, it is 100% not the same thing. You wouldn’t need to justify anything and this conversation would not be happening if it were. 
---
At a foundational level, we are talking about scrapping a game system and replacing it with a different system to achieve the same goal. 
---
A ferrari is a car and so is a toyota. That does not make them *the same thing*. 
---
This was supposed to be a #nochanges revisit to Vanilla WoW, not a *Vanilla WoW Modern Hybrid*. Where have they said they won’t pay GM’s?
---
Lucky bastard 
---
One of us. One of us. One of us. One of us.
---
I don't see a problem with adding loot trading. I think it's a good idea. It's not much different from leaving it out as many people have pointed out it can also be abused. This just adds that slight bit of safety end game looting/ninja'ing and even a chance to allow someone who intentionally or accidentally looted to show their respect by giving the item up. I don't see how this breaks or ruins the game at all. I've been playing WoW in pre-release and have championed Vanilla throughout all of it's mistakes (expansions) but there are some features / patches that are just worth making even if it's not 100% PURE ABSOLUTE ORGANIC FARM FRESH LOCAL VANILLA.

their downvotes must be resisted by orc war racial cuz its still 98%

Just because you have no time to play doesnt mean we need to cater to all normies and include that shit. 
---
It's not that big a problem imo in the case that you need to coordinate with your friends what server to pick. All it takes is an extra 20 seconds on the login screen to agree on a server to play on.
---
Now, on what servers to avoid, that's a big one. I fully intend to avoid big streamers' servers (shouldn't be a big problem on EU) so a bit of warning ahead of time would be great.
---
Found the rogue main
---
Honestly, same. I started as Horde and only ever really played Horde. Dabbled in a few of the starting quests for Ally, here and there, but never got far.
---
My old guildies and I are thinking about rolling Ally, this time around. Just for this very reason.
---
:)
---
i made a warrior just because of this move i had no idea how i was being hit
---
Your thing is "without fear of the slippery slope".
---
My thing is "the slippery slope is very, very real when it comes to Blizzard, and people aren't aware of that."
---
If I'm in a group of random there's nothing stopping me from need rolling every time I see the dice. 
---
Not sure if this is a DM vs VC joke, but it made me laugh anyway.
---
It’s not Blizzard pushing for this. It’s Activision and activisionised Blizz management; in order to cut on costs (lord knows they’re *barely* afloat).
---
Unless we all agree to boycott the game and not play/sub for a week when it launches, i doubt there will be any change.
---
Its so iconic!
---
They have been clear the reason loot trading is in is due to not having the GM staff for the tickets. I am not justifying anything, I am pointing out that there is no functional difference except the lack of GM involvement. 
---
Changing things to refuse to fix loot as many here are suggesting is a big change, as opposed to this which is a system change that achieves the same goal. 
---
It's definitely a fear of mine too. Back in vanilla, I could play a moonkin and get into groups. I did poor DPS sure, but attitudes of "static" roles wasn't the same as it is today. I wasn't a pure DPS, because I could off-heal, brez, off-tank, go into cat when I was out of mana, root, etc...
---
But today's minmaxing mentality means that unfortunately many people who want to play unorthodox specs are just going to flat out denied by groups. :(
---
While content is going to get crushed quickly, it's because we're all used to the mechanics. The mechanics themselves, are much much simpler than they are now. As such as gamers we have all "LEVELED UP" since then.
---
With that said, as you said the gear grind is going to be a wall for a ton of people. The resist requirements for many bosses, is going to take a long time to complete.
---
What people are forgetting, is the journey. The JOURNEY is what brings people back to classic. The feeling that you can't wait to log in that day because you get to play in a vast *WORLD* with *PEOPLE* occupying it. In current state of wow, you log in -&gt; queue for a dungeon/instance/raid -&gt; faceroll through it -&gt; basically say *nothing* to people, gg leave instance once it's over and go to the next. When you log in you check for your *"job"* (world quests, emissary quests) and complete whatever is relevant and usually just move to the next task.
---
I can't even tell people how many times back in classic, or even on private servers, I would run across the world to just sit and fish with someone. (or stomp the enemy faction into the dirt for looking at my friend funny)
---
The community makes the content more than anything, it's not just about the npc's.
---
You are the one arguing that Blizzard should change something that works. I'm only arguing that you have to replace a working system with something that works better, instead of ripping it out because you want to change the game to your liking.
---
Loot trading has zero negative consequences. It's not taking loot from someone else, it's fixing a mistake. You don't seem to know how it was used or why it was ever necessary.
---
You couldn't just make a ticket to get someone's stuff, both sides had to agree to it. Without it, many epics would have been lost to loot bugs and ML issues that existed back then and if you think WoW Classic will never have bugs then you are just too inexperienced with game development.
---
Classic is the tour de france of RPG experiences. If you wanna ride the whole course over 3 months, instead of leading the pack...you will be playing with other, like-minded individuals. All of the other casuals will sync up with your leveling schedule, and you will most likely develop a rival or two on the other faction who levels at the same speed as you. 
---
I would also argue that the majority of the fun in classic is your journey to 60. I’ve played slow and i’ve hit 60 in 6 days /played, and slow is almost always more fun, taking your time and smelling the roses, and spending 6 hours in STV at 40 even though it’s not getting you any xp. 
---
The minmaxers won’t bother you—and they will give you some eyecandy in Ironforge so that you can aspire to be that godly some day as you take your relaxed gondola ride through classic.
---
&gt;One thing I do find odd when people talk about not wanting to play a Shaman is having to drop all those totems
---
Honestly the totems are one of the biggest reasons why I *want* to play shaman. 
---
Healing on its own is basically whack-a-mole and gets boring quickly. But combining that with another role, laying down totems, adds a whole level of complexity and makes it much more engaging.
---
You don't know what the term "loot trading" means do you? We're not talking about items you put on the AH like farming mats or BoEs.
---
We're talking about BoPs becoming tradable for 2 hours after they drop as long as you trade to someone who was in the group for the drop.
---
Thanks for elaborating!
---
I'll do that
---
Wow your story literally sounds like mine. First character was Male dwarf hunter. Eventually tamed a white bear because I thought it would hold aggro and looked bad ass to boot. The epicness of dwarf hunter in the snow killing troggs hits me right in the nostalgic feels. It's hard for me to not go back and make another dwarf character for classic.
---
Got to early 20s without knowing about talent points or beast training  so bear only knew what he knew when I tamed him. Couldnt hold aggro and leveling got too painful and slow. Felt wrong, (was wrong) but I couldn't figure out why even when asking others. 
---
Eventually rerolled horde on another server. Troll rogue at first. Quickly switched to undead rogue after hearing their racial was OP for PVP. Fell in love with rogue due to the fluidity of energy instead of mana etc. Pvp was amazing, naturally figured out dirty rogue like tricks of extended stunlocks and constantly won battles I had no business winning. Became rogue all the way to TBC.
---
Some fond memories of rogue: stealth runs to farm barman shanker. 2.0 speed daggers before the atk speed normalization. Pvped with that dagger when everyone had bad gear and had a blast. Especially loved picking off targets in ironforge.
---
No, thank ME later https://youtu.be/GIP7MeBAx5Y
---
&gt; The dungeons are easy if you know everything but if you fuck up then there will be a wipe.
---
Oh god the wipes in dire maul tribute runs are scary. If you screw up the mechanics for any of the skips you're running back a very long way.
---
And I do agree, the dungeons can be a lot more punishing than now. Even on many M+'s in retail, mana bars don't really move, you aren't stopping you pull huge packs of enemies because it's so easy.
---
The situation you present, to me, doesn't strike me as being as bad as a ninja loot. 
---
People are always way to up in arms about loot anyway, what if there was a Moonkin at that raid? He wants the helm too but I guarantee every warlock and mage in the raid is going to throw a fit and call him a ninja if he wants to take it. 
---
A reminder to blizzard: plenty of us want sharding in starting zones
---
i dont understand why you want to force a retail system on classic. why dont you just try out the system that was in place. and you will see it was good and it worked. because servers where small and you kinda "knew" everyone on the server. so beeing an A-hole, really had an impact.
---
Yes we where not handheld with systems in place to correct missdoings, but we did that our selfs. And it made us stronger as a whole.
---
Even if the magic is gone for us old bois, there's a whole generation of kids who are gonna see vanilla for the first time ever. And God willing, we'll have thousands upon thousands more WoW addicts this summer.
---
I wish I could upvote the OP a thousand times more!
---
There is a functional difference though. You simply could not trade loot in WoW classic. You had to tread carefully.
---
Somehow private servers are able to get GM’s...why can’t a multi-billion dollar corporation outsource those efforts for pennies on the dollar?
---
Which one?
---
I think you’re missing the point man. The concerns with loot trading aren’t that people can roll need on anything they want, its that there is a very real incentive/ reward for doing it. You’re playing a rogue and a piece of int/spirit drops? Sure you could vendor it I guess, but with loot trading, you could need on it and give it to your shadow priest friend. THAT’S a real problem.
---
Casual for life has finally paid off. 
---
What is the significance of loot trading in wow classic and why is it bad? Is it going to be implemented as of the latest news? Thanks. 
---
All we know is summer. And that does not tell us much since summer is all year around at some places, haha
---
Where is warriors cost of being a hybrid spec?
---
I once had the most terrible rogue in my guild proclaim that all races were equal because potions exist. 
---
They literally just listened to us on the phases. Dont be a drama queen about them not listening.  They are paying attention.  If they want to make a cut on GMs just don't offer the service. 
---
Right. I’ve done some like really early leveling stuff, but things like Undercity are a mystery to me. 
---
So you deleted your mage and gave the name to your friend?
---
I've barely ever seen anyone say sharding is a good idea. The mass majority is not in favor of sharding what so ever. If you want sharding then you have the retail mindset where you don't want competence, server community and communication to thrive from day 1. And there is no other way to put it.
---
Most people are tracking to July 16th. Others are saying end of August.
---
I'd like a server list and id like a way to 'declare' you server and faction initially. We can use that early information to maybe make some judgement calls. 
---
Thanks for this sharing. I'm puking nostalgia right now, I cant contain the hype anymore.
---
One thing I love is the fact that Ragnaros was the true challenge for you even when Naxx was already there. Older raids were always played and made the "progression" real.
---
That literally only happened on Private servers.
---
you misunderstand the problem the problem isnt people just taking all the loot. its haveing say a warrior and paladin healer buddies rolling against a rogue for a sword. The paladin doesn't actually want it hes rolling with the intent to trade it to his friend. 
---
If no loot trading the paladin wouldn't dare roll against the warrior and rogue in case he wins and then the warrior doesn't get it either. so it actually makes it fair.
---
Speed potions so you can run faster.
---
That definitely happened in vanilla because I haven’t played on private servers and it happened multiple times to groups I was in.
---
What do you mean by competence? I'm in favor of sharding for the first week or two so I don't spend 12 hours in the starting zone competing for mobs.
---
Yours, sorry, misclicked
---
True, for some countries that's probably a much bigger issue that I didn't think about. As a US player, timezone and region is really enough to get a server close-ish to where lag isn't too bad.
---
Still though, even if we don't get the info till release, it won't take long to figure out which servers are in your area and communicate that to your guild/friends. I just don't see this being some huge problem that's going to be anything other than a minor launch inconvenience.
---
Yes of course, I understand the point, it seems you don't get the point of my suggestion though. 
---
Why don't people ninja roll every item? Because its bad for their reputation on the server.
---
Same logic applies to my idea: loot trading is completely transparent, so catching others in the act of loot trading would be harmful to their reputation in the same way. 
---
Here’s a good scenario for you to consider: you join a guild run of BRD. You want a specific drop, and you’re the only pug that got invited. 
---
Your item drops, and its both a hunter upgrade and a rogue upgrade. In Vanilla, the two of you would roll off. In this new bastardized system, all four guild members roll for the item, and you have a 1/5 chance of getting the gear you spent SIX HOURS in BRD for, rather than a 50% shot where you would be happy for the other player, because he won the roll. 
---
This is insane. Not only does it make ninja’ing gear a group activity rather than relegated to a single asshole, but it also diminishes the ability for you as a solo player to court that guild and get invited, because it can brew animosity.
---
None of the above was ever part of the vanilla experience. Bums in the czech republic are able to reproduce classic with minimal costs, why can’t blizzard?
---
nah
---
\^ This guy gets it.  We just want to have fun with a game worth playing again.  If you're not an ass, we will gladly do what we can to help and make you a better player.
---
 *Rogue pops evasion* can't touch this! (Plays the tune)
---
*Warrior sees overpower aviable* can't dodge this! (Plays metal cover of same tune)
---
Because some things that are for different classes are still legitimate. For example, cloth healer gear is better than leather/mail/plate healer gear in some slots. Does that mean the Paladin healer that needs on cloth gets kicked?
---
Besides that, though, what's to stop say, a bunch of friends who play a warlock, a priest and a mage all rolling on a staff, or ring, or something, when only one of them actually needs it, and they just trade it to their friend? Is that fair for the others in the group? People did this in WOTLK all the time when it was first introduced. They would wear "weaker" gear so they couldn't be called out, and then when the dungeon was done, they still had time left in the 2 hour window and just traded to their friend. No proof, no way to call them out, their rep wouldnt get hurt.
---
I think having loot work in multiple different ways based on what size group you are in would be more confusing to new players.
---
&gt; Does that mean the Paladin healer that needs on cloth gets kicked?
---
&gt; and they just trade it to their friend? Is that fair for the others in the group?
---
Which is why it should be kept the way it was.  
---
This guy gets it lol.
---
I see what you're saying, but having the option to trade loot with other people in raids is something that already exists in retail wow and it doesn't confuse anyone and we all know retail wow is made up of noobs ;)
---
I understand how loot trading works, I played cataclysm.
---
So if Dal Rends drops, everyone rolls, some random gets it, trades it.
---
Everyone sees that happen, gets called out and the offending party no longer gets invited to pugs. Basically the same consequence as if someone had ninjad it. 
---
Competence in getting ahead of the curve, and joining groups to communicate, and learning how to use instant tag macros.
---
It's all part of any good launch experience.
---
Before keybinding? Youre saying that abilties and spells weren't always bound to the numberkeys?
---
Sharding will be fine as long as:
---
1. It's strictly monitored and not allowed to exist past a certain point. I agree that it should be only the 1-5 starting zones but if it needs to exist in the wider 6-10 zones (i.e., Elwynn, Tirisfal, etc.) then that's not the end of the world. But there needs to be a hard cap at some point. If population issues still exist at that point then you address it the same way you would have in Vanilla, with queues, or other more drastic measures.
---
2. There has to be a way that Blizzard can make the shards less dynamic so you're not constantly seeing players pop in and out of the world. Make them more like fixed sub-servers then dynamic shards. There needs to be some sort of dynamic movement to adjust according to the population and allow friends to play together, but if retail sharding is cranked to 11, then they must be able to turn it down to like a 5.
---
I don't love the idea of huge populations and dynamic respawns. IMO shards with healthy populations and normal respawn rates is a better representation of Vanilla. We may have just interacted with different people but I don't remember anyone being happy with the starting zone experience on big pservers.
---
Or people could be responsible for what they do and triple-check before giving out loot.
---
yeah but loot in vanilla is long and take time, it could take months and months to get gear from raids. " - give ourselves an advantage" to get gear over others ? That sounds kind of greedy towards other players, why are you in a rush ?
---
Yes, «good» launch experience! 
---
I don't think they're here, though.
---
No, my thing is "The slippery slope is unlikely because it is a bad business decision." Which as a consequence leads to "without fear ..."

Do you believe that Blizzard is incapable of learning from the past or making decent business decisions? Because at the very least, if retail stays a casual game, making another casual WoW would be a really bad business decision. And I believe that they learned what changes are majorly to blame for the decline of WoW's popularity and will probably refrain from making the same mistakes.
---
I also got the dark whelp pet quite fast. But not the first kill that's for sure. I had decided that I realy wanted it and planned to farm for ages. Got it within an hour. (Never had the rng gods on my side ever since)
---
August 29th is my birthday I’d be cool with that :)
---
They were, but there wasn't enough room by your mid 30s with proper bar setup. You would be clicking multiple abilities as a paladin. Custom keybindings weren't a thing early and I had small hands. I couldn't reach my 6 easily. 
---
Doesn't fix the problem of it being abused. 
---
Also makes it harder to use it legitimately.
---
Here's a interesting note. At a certain point a rogue gets so much Dodge percent from raw agility that it's actually advantageous to pop evasion on Warriors. My NE rogue had somewhere between 30-40% Dodge in AQ/Naxx gear in original wow. Because its on a 5sec CD, It's a fact he's gonna proc overpower from one of his attacks during that window anyway, so use evasion to avoid everything else.
---
No one is perfect. Even the most hardcore guilds make mistakes.
---
What is the downside to loot trading in raids? I have only seen arguments against it in 5-mans, where guildmates can team up against strangers.
---
&gt;I've barely ever seen anyone say sharding is a good idea.
---
here you go:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/asvwjq/transcript_ion_hazzikostas_on_sharding_blizzcon/
---
I'm pretty sure I understand what you're trying to say, but you're also implying that people would not abuse the living crap out of loot trading out of fear of damage to their reputation.  This is absolutely incorrect.
---
&gt;You fabricated a reality to support your personal desires. You painted the people who want the thing you don't want as boogeyman with foolish, self-centered goals in order to make them seem foolish. From there it is implied that only a fool would want the same things as them.
---
I don't know where you're getting this from. I played extensively on both EDIT: REDACTED &amp; REDACTED. I think basically all the changes that they made are good.
---
1) I think a progressive content release with frozen 1.12 is vastly superior to just releasing an actually blizzlike 1.12 server with all the content out. I think a blizzlike 1.12 (meaning all the content is out at release) would be a game that is dead on arrival.
---
3) I think the supporting changes to make 1.12 work really do work well. Some mechanics (like old Onyxia conflagrate) were kept to make raid encounters feel a bit more difficult. There's also good evidence that boss armor and resist was increased on private servers compared to how it was in 1.12. We know for a fact that C'thun is significantly overtuned in this respect, in particular. I think that progressive itemization also helps with this, as does progressive tuning of classes (like for example, Lupos dealing shadow damage until 1.9).
---
4) I also think that the dynamic spawns (as well as changing up various gathering node locations) is needed to make such a high pop server work, and with some exceptions (like caves) really does a lot more good than harm.
---
5) I also think that the diremaul gold nerfs were needed to combat gold inflation (and I seriously hope Blizzard implements this).
---
SO yeah, you're totally off base accusing me of calling these people fools for asking for changes that make the game Nostlike. I wouldn't really call them fools because I ALSO WANT CHANGES, IN FACT MOST OF THE PRIVATE SERVER CHANGES.
---
The distinction is where you draw the line.
---
No-Changer's line is "yes, I'm all for changes, but only the changes from Vanilla WoW -&gt; Private Server style. Anything else crosses the line."
---
And I say back to them "Yes, I agree with you that the a bunch of the changes made to private servers allowed us to end up with an improved version of Vanilla WoW. And yes, I recognize that there is definitely a safety in only adopting these changes, because they've been tested and shown to work on private servers. But, I don't draw the line there - we have at least decent evidence from TBC that certain spec rebalancing would work, and I think we should do that."
---
But you're just totally wrong to say I'm painting them "as a boogeyman with foolish, self-centered goals", or that "only a fool would want the same things as them." Because these are largely goals I SHARE, and I STRONGLY support their goals over something that would actually be blizzlike (again the 1.12 with everything out).
---
Yes, I do want something different. I want balance changes. But my position can't be they're wrong for wanting what they want. Because the crux of my argument is that what they want is Changes, to get something Nostlike instead of what is Blizzlike. But I also want changes. If you're right, my stance would be "Haha look at these idiots who want changes... Anyways, the changes I want are..." That would be preposterous.
---
I'd ask you to consider what I wrote and reflect on whether you still believe this. You seem to be operating on certain incorrect presumptions about me, or my stance towards private server players. You seem to have somehow read in me saying that the changes the private server players want are bad. These probably put a gloss on what I wrote and prevented you from seeing what I actually intended. I'm happy to discuss the topic more with you if you're interested.
---
But maybe you still see me as doing "political maneuvering" (I'm really not sure what you meant by this). I tried to provide an argument for why a "no-changer" can't reject an ask for balance changes on the grounds that "it isn't vanilla" which is literally the initial post I was responding to. Namely because what they're doing is asking for something which isn't vanilla (again, they're asking for something, which I agree is better than vanilla). I'm a little unsure what your response is doing - you're saying that I'm incorrect because... I'm doing political maneuvering? Because I've shown that my opponent's position is silly? I'm sorry, but I don't understand the point you're making here.
---
EDIT NOTE: I had to delete my first response to you because I mentioned the servers I played on by name. One of them was the server that got all the news and the devs went to visit blizzard, and the other one was the direct successor server. 
---
You said "the way it is", not "the way it was". The way it is is present day, which is loot trading. Very different from the way it was, which is no loot trading :P
---
Yes believe it or not, competing for resources and communication are good things in MMORPGs. Shocker for the new era mindset I know.
---
You talk about communication, community, etc. in the same breath as instant tag macros. 
---
So which are you supporting? Kill stealing or taking turns?
---
\*Also I have been playing wow since release - even have experience with pre/beta . I am not some expansion newbie or casual. I just want the community to take the opportunity to make this an even more amazing experience than it was before!
---
but tell me how do you see it happen? It can be invisible so easily.
---
Oh sorry, I play on a private server.  So yah, the way it was back then lol
---
The guy that posted this on the Phoenix DAoC forums did it better. 
---
So then open a ticket.
---
This was not a problem in Vanilla.  It was not a problem in TBC.  It won't be an issue in Classic.
---
If we were making changes, this would be a good one. Level margin’s effect on spell hit in PvP is dumb; it should just be reduced damage, so that low-level casters can be roughly as useful as low-level non-casters against much higher level players. But... yea.... not likely ... 
---
Welcome to r/classicwow where everyone is a next generation game designer xd
---
Nah more of a been there, done that mentality. Its the valley of trials for fucks sake. Get over it
---
No loot trading. It creates a culture of just rolling on whatever and figuring it out later. Some players hide their shenanigans  behind that system. 
---
Rogues are the most Overpowered class in vanilla
---
Ahhh I see, thank you.
---
*misses*
---
Didn't you read my post? The whole idea was to make it NOT invisible 
---
Soon(ish)^^TM .  Thats about all we know.
---
&gt; The mass majority is not in favor of sharding what so ever. 
---
This is not the impression I get.
---
Seems like the mass majority accept that sharding is going to provide the best experience for the beginning of classic. 
---
Blizzard has stated, strongly, that it will be temporary and it will only be in the initial leveling zones. 
---
It would be fair to state that the vast majority do not want sharding to exist past the initial weeks and in any other zones. 
---
[When everybody is packed into Valley of Trials, and when everybody is packed into Elwynn...](https://youtu.be/Q-GobXQTf6w?t=116) 
---
That's where people are pulling that info from. You're right though, he didn't say *only* those zones, but he also didn't say anywhere else.
---
I had an addon named «PvpLog», that gave some extra info in tooltip in the form of X / Y for x kills and y deaths. It also had a KOS-list, with alerts.
---
Havnt found anything like it.
---
I was torn like you are, but I've made up my mind (for now) and am staying horde. I couldn't find any (and still can't find any) horde guilds recruiting for RP-PvP raiding in the US, but I found an ally one; so I figured hey I'll give it a shot. Leveled up a couple ally characters on private servers... I can't stand it. It feels like I'm playing... wrong? all the time. Everything just seems off. The towns, the other players, my character, just wrong. I also thought I'd enjoy "new" quests and zones a lot more than I do, I much prefer the horde towns, buildings, and NPCs.
---
Even though I'm playing a sub-optimal raiding class, even if I can't find a guild before release, I'll still be rolling horde.
---
There are a lot of short use pots that can help, but over the course of 100+ hours, those are cost prohibitive to use.
---
A scroll that vendors for 1s 25c that I can buy for 2x vendor costs me 5 silver an hour.
---
Swiftness pots might be cheap, being a low leveling one, so definitely a pick up if they're around, but who knows about long-term use of them. Even if they're 5s a pop, that's 150g to use on cooldown over a leveling route :P
---
Mutually exclusive. 
---
You can be in a group communicating for faster mob tags/kills, and you use instant tag macros to compete against the group next to you.
---
You're making it sound as if you use instant tag macros that it somehow damages communication or community.
---
Welcome to old WoW, where competition actually results in communication and rivalries/friendships. And that should exist for day 1 for fast levelers to get ahead of the curve. (And no I won't be one of them, but I understand the existence of that is healthy for an MMORPG).
---
It's because they're not stupid and know that's not how it will turn out. People will be foaming at the mouths if those lose an epic because it couldn't be looted to them.
---
It wasn't a problem in Vanilla because, as you said, people opened tickets for it. Now there's a more efficient way to do it, which is letting the raid handle it themselves.
---
I'm keeping an open mind about this, and I haven't heard any good argument against having this option in raid groups. The only thing I've heard is that it's bad because it's different.
---
So you are telling me a group ninja's you. No problem, you take screenshots, ask them nicely to give it to whoever won the roll between the two of you (More screenshots) and when they refuse you leave the run, and go post that on server discord that will certainly exist. Now that guild has a black eye, those players are going to go on a lot of blacklists and the social pressure fixes the problem. This is no different to a guild group that throws on ML as soon as you start that boss fight and do the same thing.
---
The system is different, the way things work out is not.
---
The extreme gap seen on private servers is most likely not how it was in vanilla. So there is probably no reason for concern.
---
Classics goal is to match vanilla as closely as possible so I am against changing it from what blizzards finds on their reference client whether they match private servers or not.
---
&gt; I am really open to opinions here as I can't personally think of a flaw with this. 
---
You're not thinking about what 60 really means. There is a stark difference between "just dinged 60" and "We've got MC on farm" 60.
---
If I've put the ungodly number of hours into my 60 for top gear, I don't want to be evenly matched with a fresh 60.
---
Likewise, I don't want to see a level 39 warrior, still wearing mail, and lose to him in my T2 gear.
---
Your solution is exactly what Guild Wars 2 tried to do: you can level from 1 to (max) doing pure PVP and you always scale up to max when you play. The feeling of progression and accomplishment was always missing because from the moment you entered the WvWvW battleground, you were equally as powerful as anyone else.
---
I feel only players that actually played Vanilla wow should have a say. This is just another post by a p server player that has no clue about Vanilla.
---
I was of course nowhere near the first to find this out but I did it my first ever time in dm on my own and thought I was sooo smart hahaha 
---
Classes that you don't bring a lot of will gear fastest. My guild disenchanted tons of druid and lock tiers because our few druids and locks had all the pieces. If you play one of those two classes, you will gear the fastest... If you can find a raid slot since min/max Bois will be adverse to taking a lot. But according to stats, they are some of the least played classes, so you can take solace there
---
I am speaking from vanilla  playtime here. Yes also from private servers but it was practically as bad. I really don't want to make anything break the game but would really love some quality of life improvements.
---
They have a pretty consistent track record over a decade or so of having absolutely no clue why WoW is in a decline. They've made retail so casual even the casuals dont want anything to do with it anymore. It's pretty safe to say we can't trust them and they dont in fact learn from their mistakes, as they have continued to repeat those mistakes for a decade now. And yes, I can trust them to make poor decisions, because the people at the top, the shareholders and the like, dont care about the product, they care about the bottom line. And they dont care about the long term either, they care about quarterly reports showing growth. So they'll decide to do whatever gets them the most money in as fast a span of time as possible, regardless of what happens a few years down the line.
---
No you didn't. You and your buddies all roll on an item that you want in a 5 man. The mage wins the roll for your chestpiece that he can't wear. Now you both ticket saying it was a misclick and you want them to give you the item. It takes a few days, and you get it. 
---
There is a time difference, but shitty people doing shitty things were not stopped by the lack of a direct system. Pirate servers don't have to service millions of people, and their CS is terrible at best. Blizz is not a 3 man operation run out of some third world shithole, and more is expected from them. 
---
So..why not use ML instead of this awful system? There is no getting around the fact that Blizz needs to hire GM’s or tech support to handle ingame issues, where the game is so socially geared. This will be the primary downfall of vanilla classic if they keep going down this path of “we are only making changes to the game that lower maintenance costs”
---
You need to be more specific.  2-3 level 55 characters can definitely kill a single level 60 depending on skill level and class.  10-15 level 45's can definitely kill a level 60.
---
What level was your group of 10 or 15 buddies when you got wiped out by a single level 60?
---
Same here.
---
As an avid vanilla player I do not view loot trading as a negative on the game.
---
This game was founded on having this services available for the players because it was better for the game as a whole.  If Blizzard wants to use their modern solution to this problem I understand.
---
Personally I plan on not using the feature ever if possible, but I am glad it's there in case me or someone I know makes an honest mistake.
---
EXACTLY. That’s my point. If a 3 man operation in a third world shitthole can replicate the vanilla experience extremely well, why can’t blizzard? 
---
I'll take sharding over a 9 hour queue. Thanks blizz.
---
love the 10 second stun tbh
---
What you call competition here, I call being an asshole. If me and 4 others who are grouped with me are waiting for what-his-name to spawn in the vineyard there so we can get his head for the quest and your group comes along and macro-tags him as he spawns? There's no healthy rivalry there, just 5 people to put on the fuck-those-guys list.
---
Would consider PI if you always queued up with a Arcane Power mage every dungeon? 
---
I mean I get the who competition thing, but hundreds of people competing for 10 mobs is a bit excessive
---
beautiful
---
I'ma go ahead and say NO to you thinking 'we get why loot trading is needed'.
---
Yea that's the feeling I've been getting as well
---
down voting the truth, lol.
---
I really expect most comments to mirror this one, happy I've already had some positive replies tho.   
---
The way I see it is I am doing nothing more than making an observation and suggestion with the intent on improving the game-play for everyone. I'm not suggesting it's easy or plausible I just want to bring it up in case no one else ever does.  
---
I don't think it's beneficial to shoot down ideas right from the get-go but if you have information or theories as to why they are not good suggestions I think they are as valuable and welcomed!
---
Servers were available for viewing before you could login at release iirc. Because a lot of the dark age of Camelot community rolled on the same server which was known before the game went live, server was Stormscale.
---
\*smiles instinctively\* 
---
Lots of players knew about this feature, as it was posted on the WoW website it was available, and yes people did request loot trades for blue items, although the most common was raid items.
---
The only reason i'm even bothering to post is because I'm seeing a lot of interaction between the community and the developers which is really blowing my mind. I figure why not take the time to get some items out there and I agree with you probably unlikely but nothing worse than not trying. Thank you for your reply! 
---
Is his name pronounced like Smite like Divine Smite or like Smih-teeh?
---
More efficient isn't always better.  Especially when community is involved.
---
*miss*
---
A queue will exist regardless of sharding though.
---
I agree with you.  The ability to resolve our own loot issues is a positive, and loot trading doesn't allow anything a GM in vanilla wouldn't have also allowed.  There will be more ninja looting in 5 mans for sure, but it's something we can work around as a community.
---
﻿  
---
There's a difference between knowing why it's needing and disagreeing with it. No need to stick your head in the sand because you can't have a reasonable debate. For Blizzard, loot trading translates into them saving millions of dollars per year on staff costs, reducing the strain on the already very limited GM staff. This is why they will do it.
---
That’s amazing. 
---
Significantly less with sharding... that's why sharding is a thing.
---
this is so amazing!
---
Just here to say I am not part of your WE
---
I love vanilla WoW and am not interested in any other version of the game.  The addition of loot trading does nothing to change that for me, and in fact I view it as a maybe positive, as it's good we can resolve our own legitimate loot issues without having to involve customer service.
---
We were a mix of lvl 15's  &amp; 24's the odd 30 and a single 50.   
---
Yes it's a higher chance but you will also lose close to 10 of those 45's I mean does the gap need to be that extreme?!
---
I don't know the algorithm of numbers unfortunately and can only hope that the developers would make the correct most correct/minimalistic changes as possible to achieve a healthy balance.  
---
Pre raid.
---
Easiest. Warrior. You tank and simply don't bring people that share loot like rogues. Go on any private server and all you see is "lfm ranged".
---
Worst. Rogues. Same reason.
---
Raids 
---
Easiest Druid and nothing is really terrible. IMO loot councils are for masochists unless you are running them and are basically a complete scumbag. Especially with nerfed raid content that is already known. The reason people push loot council as being good is they want to screw people over. Much better to be a smart player and simply bid on items you really want. Example of this is mage tier 1 is trash. Let the dumb mages get this crap. Instead get the spell power trinket.
---
They can't, that's the point.
---
Oh man, but they do. I’ve had a GM respond to my request for a bugged instance door or mob not spawning, or a bugged quest item within 5 minutes, in multiple different scenarios.
---
It’s not hard.
---
Druid, hunter and warlock are the least played classes and you bring the least of then to a raid. So they get their tier gear incredibly fast.
---
ML is not the answer to misloot issues. ML is half the reason this system exists. it is too easy to misclick on names especially in raids and put the wrong item in the wrong persons bags. With dungeon loot it's annoying, with raid loot it can be a serious problem. 
---
They have GM's, but they also have numbers on how many loot tickets they dealt with every day during vanilla and TBC before this system came into being in lich king. They won't spent the money on having people doing this stuff all day when they can easily solve the issue.
---
Although I do mostly agree with you, I don't think you have the liberty to say "we" here. It should probably just say "I get why.."
---
You will have to reach it first tho :)
---
You dont get it. People want the original game, with all of its flaws. Not answers to “problems”. Thats what modern wow is for.
---
You're both partially right and partially wrong.
---
* Ion didn't specify fixed zones, level ranges, or timelines for the sharding. It's unlikely they ever will because they're going to want some flexibility to see how the launch plays out.
---
* He absolutely did not say "especially" at launch, which would imply it's also going to be used on a day to day basis. He very much specified that sharding was a tool they were considering using in "the first few weeks" and "in a very limited way" to "solve the initial launch load problems." Ion outright acknowledged that sharding on a day to day basis had no place in Classic and that competition over resources and mobs is integral to the game.
---
Right and that's the beautiful thing. You will know who's an asshole from day 1.
---
And believe me people WILL worry about their reputation and act in a civil manner if they're competing for a single mob or an item. If it's one of those quests to kill 10 mobs or whatever mobs then yeah it's whoever gets the tag first. If it's one NPC or one item then you will see organization within your server community and that is awesome to see! with sharding you won't experience that.
---
Have you not seen screenshots from private servers forming long lines to get their quest item from a closet or to kill one NPC etc.?
---
Upvoted, but in fairness, this actually **is** next-generation design.
---
Think about the BR shooters. You have 100 different skins, but all players are evenly matched and have the same starting equipment. If you get into a game with Ninja, he doesn't instantly have an advantage over you and your friends, despite playing for thousands of hours.
---
Guild Wars 2, which IMO was the first next-gen MMO, had a similar setup in PVP and PVE. It scaled your gear and HP to the zone or battleground you were in so that the mobs or other players always had a fair fight.
---
You can get rank 25 in Tetris 99 and still get beaten by someone playing their first game.
---
Dota, League of Legends, Artifact, HotS, Overwatch... in most cases, its really difficult to build such a wide gear gap that you can steamroll anyone.
---
I'm not saying that I *like* this next-gen design, but I recognize it. Everyone has a chance. Everything is more fair, even if it negates some of the time and effort that some put in to be the best.
---
If WoW was designed as a new game today, they'd absolutely normalize WSG, AB, and AV so that you'd always have a fair fight. They *might* keep the rock, paper, scissors mechanics between classes, but I doubt it.
---
You’re either a troll looking for trouble, or you are just dense... No means no, just like you learn in school and life... Classic WoW... No sharding, no loot trading, no right click report... If it didn’t exist in 2006, it shouldn’t go into Classic! No changes!
---

I feel like the generalization that only bad players play "meme specs" and good players play good specs is wrong. Bad players (in my experience) usually try to find the most OP/Meta/Faceroll shit they can. That way they get class carried instead of skill carried. Good players tend to play what they want and do what they can to make it work. Sure there will be some casuals that play what they want. But, those players are casuals. So its really not going to matter what spec they choose.
---
As someone who never experience vanilla end game, I want to know what is worse. A good player playing a "meme spec", doing all the raid mechanics and not standing in fire. Or, a shit player playing a faceroll meta "Non meme" 1 button mashing spec. Who doesn't do their job.    
---
I'm not to sure how much of a DPS check the vanilla bosses are, or how big of margins the meters are. But, is it really so bad that some specs will be turned down because they do 200~ less dps than another spec? Even if the player is piloting the spec and raid mechanics correctly.  
---
Also, it seems that raiding is going to be a small part of vanilla (as far as actually how much time you spend IN the raid). Why would you choose a spec based on ONLY how viable it is IN the raid? The leveling process is a big part of the vanilla experience. As well as farming, PVP and gearing up for raid. Why would someone choose to play through all of that content on a class/spec they don't enjoy, just so they can play a spec that tops the meters in raid? 
---
From what I have seen in interviews they do know what mistakes they have made. Not that they know all mistakes, but at least some of them. And to be fair: we, the players, also liked the changes when they were introduced first (like the dungeon finder). Because we also had no clue about the consequences.
---
And while you are right, that shareholders only care about the bottom line and look at quarterly reports ... does not mean that they do not care about the long term (because they do!). Because they have invested their money into the firm, and if its value decreases the investment is gone. The quarterly reports are just a poor performance measure of how well a company is doing and its growth. And, since retail is at a decline, the bottom line does get affected. Thus everyone that has their hands on classic wow has an incentive to not fuck up again.
---
I am fine with sharding for the first 20 levels or 30 days, whichever makes the most sense from a server standpoint. I just hope that blizzard sets some sort of defined limit on the sharding before launch. I do not want sharding after the initial launch of classic.
---
Sharding is not there to address queues. Since they down ported from modern client, the clouding tech is already there. It saves them money to throw that in rather than addressing server stability issues, which is what they should do.
---
And if you've been following recent Blizzard news, they're all about cutting costs now.
---
Yes! Spread the positive vibes my friend ♥️
---
well played, my good sir
---
I don’t agree with anything he said, but I do agree with your point that his use of “We” is wrong... It’s either an attempt to troll, or it’s coming from someone to dumb to realize that he doesn’t speak for anyone but himself... There is no WE, it’s only you and other individuals like you that can’t accept the idea of no changes from the original game...
---
At launch? No, the majority of people will not worry about their reputation. A lot of the mess will be the so dubbed "tourists" who don't actually care, and the rest of the mess will be those folks who want to hit max level ASAP.
---
You're under some sort of assumption that sharding will mean you only see half a dozen people in the starting zones? That's not how it's going to go. The zones will be packed even with sharding. That's kind of the point of using it.
---
You'll still get what you're after (community, group forming, etc.) and I'll still get what I'm after (the same thing but with actually being able to log into the game and not sit in a 3 hour queue).
---
PI is great for more veteran raid groups because in those cases a boss fight usually lasts for about 1 minute. Power Infusion lasts for 15secs, which means the uptime is about 25% (higher if the boss is killed faster). 
---
In dungeons it's usually the trash that is the main obstacle, and the bosses are just loot piñatas, and if the boss is a hard one, it will probably last for a few minutes which means your initial PI-buff just increased 1 persons dps marginally for maybe 5% of the fight. 
---
You would much rather have a good solid spec that increases your healing throughout the dungeon to prepare yourself for unplanned trash pulls, long boss fights, etc.
---
Loot trading is not objectively “Needed” because there is another solid option that will work. All loot being final is another very real way this could be handled. Again saving them millions, and also keeping a strong portion of the player base satisfied.
---
The other things stated in your post I wont even get into.
---
Trust me, if I really had something against you I would have written more than a sentence. I just find the abundance of game design change centered posts in the subreddit is all.
---
Server names were not known before hand.
---
Stormscale was chosen as the "last pvp server in alphabetical order"
---
I played Horde for the first few months strictly before trying an Alliance character. This encounter threw me for a loop because Horde had nothing like it. I was like "what, im stunned, wtf is this cinematic stuff!" Really cool flavor in this encounter.
---
I can hear the sound clip perfectly. 
---
&gt; That's false. What they said was ESPECIALLY at launch in the EARLY zones.
---
Actually what they said is they're aware sharding is antithetical to the vanilla experience.
---
standing in the exact same spot killing the same mob 10 times because it instantly respawns is peak immersion
---
rolling 2 factions: completely possible.
---
but having both tons raiding 2-3 nights and still farming mats / gold and what not.. probably a bit of a strain depending on your time.
---
and option too though would be to find a guild on one faction you really enjoy and raid with.. then get them to roll an alt sister guild on the other faction and fit in an alt raid night for that faction maybe 1 night a week.. you'd gear slower but then you don't risk having overlapping nights or priorities. 
---
Thank you for the perspective!   
---
I get what you are saying and again I don't want to make it seem like I'm trying to suggest they change the game dramatically. I agree that if you are a geared 60 you should without a doubt be more powerful than anyone not 60 or poorly geared. This comes in the way of DMG dealt and dmg taken which is completely different from hit %.  
---
I think it's a pretty selfish way to think "you shouldn't be able to touch me at all because i've played 800 hours and you haven't, full stop no exceptions" . I am talking simply about allowing lower lvl characters to be able to HIT the target.. If they do 3 dmg that is perfect. If you were jumped by 40 lvl 10's (lol) do you not think it would be a lot funnier and more realistic to be able to be killed by them? As it stands this is completely impossible. 1 lvl 60 even ungeared can wipe ever single one of them out. It cannot happen because they simply can't even HIT the target.  
---
I am not trying to take the glory away from the grind or the honor away from end game players but there is so much more to consider when thinking about classic other then just the few high-end guilds, players and raids. One of the biggest factors to vanillas success was the community which was made up of a multitude of non-gear based factors. It was created by the commerce which in itself was created by the dynamic of players and population (hardcore and CASUAL). This kind of balance is and has always been effected when you make things relentless / more towards the hardcore aspect. If you are REALLY hardcore why don't they just make characters lose all of their gear on death or perhaps your character gets deleted?Most people that are hardcore even for wow players wouldn't like that and it's a good thing that someone was looking out for the overall lifespan and balance of the game from the casual perspective.
---
Nothing about not gaining an advantage other than experience for playing longer is basically all games before 2004. What about that is **next**\-generation?
---
This is amazing 
---
The primary purpose isn't to address queues... but they still do.
---
This question is impossible to answer as many guilds will not care about the "optimal" setup. I'd also think that druids would be the class that's least presented but that won't really matter much.
---
Ultimately, fastest to gear is the main tank. Then the off tank. Then everything else.
---
*2 hours later*
---
Well, tbh I don't even remember doing that! It was probably as a placeholder until he bought the game later. It's his main nickname even as of today. Or maybe he tried the game at my place before buying it. It feels strange after all those years.
---
Yeah, but I don't care if you've downed KT, you should not be able to solo a full raid of lvl 20s, and that's what the current system does since due to hit mechanics you can't even interact with them. Sure, you have more hp, you have more abilities, more proc, you hit harder, that's fine. But the hit calculations remove any ability from lowbies to even play the game. It shouldn't take some lvl 60 flying in from Stormwind to try and defend Redridge. A group of levelers should be able to form up and drive out the invaders. What we have now where a single player can shut down a whole zone is awful game design.
---
One the things I loved about vanilla was the constant improvement of the game.  New content came out at a good rate.  I could justify my sub because of this.  I remember being proud that, unlike guildwars at the time, there weren't a dozen expansions.
---
I would love to have the small patch progression with content that fits into Classic style but I can't see that ever happening.  Blizzard is not the same company it was when they first made Wow.  When the focus is on the money and not the game it changes things.
---
Yeah I do that but am curious if there’s a unique way around the entire stun 
---
I disagree with the arguement that ninja wasnt a thing. If anything it was bigger in classic with dungeons that bosses had chest drops and what not than it was in anything else. I recently started playing vanilla again a few months ago and ive seen and heard of ninja acts all over the place. Even if its just changing to ml right before emporer dies and ninja looting the drops to themself ive seen that first hand. Or enchanter taking all the blues for de to hand out at end only to say fuck u all and hearth. Some of this is just rude people but i can see that maybe the nature of the poor itemization of the game and how hard some pieces r driving the less politely inclined to ninja their way to gear.
---
Well, we'll have to agree to disagree.
---
I consider myself an above average/good player and I love studying the game. I want to do the best thing available to me at all times and I like reading the input of better players that already did that too.
---
It doesn't mean that I'll take all that blindly without thinkin myself about what is being said and I'll just follow instructions like a trained monkey (guess that was your point?).
---
I have 3 warriors on 110 , one on 120 und 6 rogues 100-120
---
I laughed. I felt sad. 
---
Absolutely! When I was ready to raid for the first time, I looked at the guilds in my server and there were several which were still progressing through MC.
---
so if you have the mindset for rushing past everyone in a group of 5 and leveling off grinding level 5-6 mobs at level 1 to avoid the rush.. then sharing should do nothing to you and also you are avoiding the same thing you think everyone else should have to do.. I don't get the difference.. you want community but also say that people are stupid and should learn to bypass the herd.. 
---
Absolutely love posts like this 
---
Depending on how much time you plan on putting into WoW, sure you can raid in as many guilds as you want. I mean, who will stop you?👀 I actually raided in two guilds on a proc server. Their schedules was on different days, so it was no problem as I had no life outside of the game anyways, lol. 
---
What I know for a fact is that on PvP realms, you are only enabled to play on one of the factions (per account). E.g. if you create an Alliance char, you can’t create another horde char unless you delete the existing Alliance chars on that realm. 
---
On PvE realms however, you can play on both factions simultaneously! 
---
What? I cant hear you from this height.
---
I’m sure grinning, content with yourself after such an enlightened observation. Unfortunately, when you attack a strawman like that, you look terriby silly. You see, nobody claims that ‘everyone would be a ninja’, that’s just what you turn the argument into because it’s easy to counterargue. So you didn’t prove anybody wrong, but hey, at least you won your imaginary argument!
---
No one is going to be banned for asking for game changes. If they're spamming and trolling in chat then report them for being spammy trolls, not for the topic they're being spammy trolls about.
---
I'd recommend checking out the [Classic Druid Discord](https://discord.gg/uscwdeP). There's some really smart and dedicated people in there constantly testing and theorycrafing (including the guy who made the sheet you referenced).
---
From what I've seen on pservers, Nature's Grace/Regrowth &gt; HT/Swiftmend and generally you stack as much +heal as possible since most fights are insanely quick and you regen by spamming major mana pots, runes, and night dragon. I know this isn't the definitive type of info you're looking for but figured I'd chime in what I know.
---
I wasn't a huge fan of the spreadsheet either since it didn't really explain shit. 
---
It's always advantageous in vanilla and TBC. Since overpower has a cooldown, you're trading one almost guaranteed crit of overpower for an almost guaranteed dodge of everything else. Even with evasion you never stand and facetank a warrior 1v1 anyway, you use it as an emergency in a situation where you've been caught and need to resume your crippling poison dead zone kiting as energy regens or XvY you use it because the warrior is outside of CC and you need to survive for your healer to help.
---
If by 20 levels you mean 10, and by 30 days you mean 7 days I'm with your idea. Sharding should only be there at the very start of Classic.
---
I'll let you know that I have played vanilla on retail back in the day and also played on lots of private servers since then. And I am in favor of being able to play the game with updated graphics. And I am not the only one.
---
Most rogues can’t spell “rogue”.  
---
Thanks for this reply!  
---
I really would hate to see them change too much and I certainly am not hinting that they should aim to make it "more fair".  I really did and do love vanilla as it is and would hate to see any of our suggestions or the new changes break the game. I am even shy of using the word "fair" because honestly I don't want them to take that the wrong way. I absolutely think a lvl 60 (who's spent hours of their life playing the game) SHOULD be able to crush anyone under their respective level / gear - absolutely! But giving other players an absolutely 0% chance to do even 1dmg is insane and I think just a terrible oversight that happened way back.  
---
To re-cap I'm talking about anyone under lvl 60 (essentially 45ish) be able to just HIT the target and do 1 dmg.. 1 SINGLE DMG not even 2!! The fact that it is 99.99% guaranteed 0 dmg is what blows my mind and I think that if we just changed this little number it would make a huge difference.
---
Why are you so butthurt that people want to switch their client to modern graphics? You can play it with your preferred graphic settings and they with theirs.
---
Not going to lie, before clicking on this post I had some reservations because I assumed it was some form of shit post; however, I haven't been this happy to be proven wrong in a long while!
---
Excellent message to spread, both to Blizzard and all of the people that are interested in Classic.
---
Oh, I didn’t say that Blizzard would actually do it, just that they have our support if they choose to, lol!
---
"Alright I've fixed my gear and this time try pulling mobs in this order"
---
Sharpening/Weight Stone.
---
Agi elixirs OR scrolls.
---
Troll's elixirs.
---
Stamina food AND scrolls.
---
Strength scrolls or elixirs are not worth the expenses.
---
Cute... 😏
---
Flushing out the empty zones would be nice.  The balance would be fitting it into the Classic feel without it becoming the OP Cata zone quest chains.
---
Competence is having a job and not being able to take vacation for launch day, especially since most of us are now plenty far into adulthood.
---
Not everyone is going to be able to log on instantly and start playing.  Others will be wanting to get a start on professions, or go get a guild charter, etc.  Making the game impossible for people doing any of that to play is just silly.
---
I think almost everyone thats fine with sharding is ONLY fine with it if used very, very conservatively (starting areas/zones only), and only when it first opens up, simply so people can actually enjoy the game without having to no life it.
---
Ur best bet in that scenario is to use all of ur lowbies as healers for the lvl 50. U can’t expect 20 lvl 20s to be able to magically withstand a lvl 60 aoe ability supported by great gear. 60s can kill 60s very fast, what makes you think a level 20 is going to do much? Don’t forget that the armor values of a level 60 are much higher than what a lvl 20 attacks. 
---
And allowing spells to always hit would turn into lowbie mages trolling 60s with sheep/fear. 
---
this is the thousandth time this thread has been made
---
Of course, except this option existed at the time. Not having loot fixing is a change, vanilla had loot fixing full stop.
---
They have this mechanic in game - it's called a PVE server.
---
That's not sarcasm.
---
How come druid horde side is easier? Are there less horde druids?
---
Than the rogue does some 5-8 kiting and proves he's not a casual after all :)
---
I don’t see this ever happening in a million years but good idea lol
---
&gt;Strength scrolls or elixirs are not worth the expenses.
---
Both should be pretty cheap, and for paladins, STR &gt; AGI (though I'd like to have both up)
---
Cool deal, i'm sure that your anecdotal experience means that some morons running a pirate server are better than blizz. 
---
I likely agree with your point on 10 levels, and honestly 7 days is probably right, though i could see it being necessary to extend it **A BIT**.  Not extending it indefinitely, or for months, etc...but if (when) lots of people start to enjoy the game, i could easily see a strong influx of players that lasts for more than a week.
---
No changes... It’s not even an option, just accept it... 
---
1.12 without any kind of tuning or changes to anything is not the "vanilla experience". Anyone who wants it to be 100% like 1.12 with nothing else changed whatsoever doesn't know what they're talking about.
---
I didn’t say that. Enough with the rhetoric trump
---
Didnt exist stop manipulating the facts
---
Fair enough. Honestly I value the perspective man it's good to have both sides active and contributing. I know what you mean by people just over sharing their opinions on what would make the game better and I really don't want to cross the line. I do however think there is value in listening to those who play your game and support your company.  
---
 I like the way you put "next generation game development" because I feel like this does describe the path that gaming is and has been going. There is PLENTY wrong with just taking people suggestions as absolute but I think there is a lot of good that can come from using your player base to play-test and make suggestions. I am sure you have some of your own and I would really like to see a space where they are welcomed.
---
Hot damn.
---
This is about warriors
---
why is that? my guild in vanilla before aq opened decided to roll another alt guild on a PVP server (we were pve server).. we did a couple alt raids before aq patch and ended up abandoning the characters for the aq event.. but we already had bwl and mc on farm and raided twice a week...
---
we stayed alliance for both but nothing stopped us from doing horde instead.. 
---
Off topic but what is that addon that allows for multiple name plates on the top? 
---
Improved renew is useless - for those three talent points you could have Spirit of Redemption (which sucks), Holy Nova (doesn't suck) and either one point in improved renew or holy reach.
---
Nah, they don't care about the long term. It's a pretty common business tactic done nowadays, seen most commonly with CEOs in particular. They join a company, do a bunch of short term decisions that will make them look good, then leave to another company before the long term effects catch up to them, so their successor has to deal with the mess and they look like roses.
---
My thoughts on loot trading.
---
1. I don't think it's going to be that big of an issue. Abuse will be about as common as ninja looters were in Vanilla, which was not that common. Despite what the internet seems to think, most people aren't assholes.
---
2. That said, since it's causing so much of an uproar I just don't see the point. I don't even remember trading loot through GM tickets being a thing in Vanilla. Why not just tell players, no trading, no GM tickets, BoP is BoP, too bad, better luck next time, life's not fair, etc.
---
Regarding sharding. I understand the concerns because sharding truly is something that goes against what Vanilla was about. **However**, Blizzard has been extremely clear that they see it as a potential tool to address the launch rush and they understand it has no place in the game long-term. That's good enough for me.
---
This. Why do so many people keep suggesting "this one tiny QoL change that's needed"? Do people not understand that Classic should be Classic? No changes. If you want QoL, retail is there waiting for you.
---
Wow, well if you want to be willfully ignorant I guess it's time to move on. It has existed since day one, maybe you just weren't there to see it?
---
It isn't really greedy if you are not taking the gear from other people. There is just less competition. It isn't even necessarily a rush.. it is more about getting all of your tier. Due to low drop numbers and RNG some more competitive tier sets may be near impossible to complete for a very long time.
---
Deadman's Hand is a TBC item.
---
Well then why are you acting like anything some pirate server does has an impact here? You feel like throwing around nonsense, sorry that you have no argument.
---
Even if it fails, I will still enjoy it.
---
Just like Blair Witch 2. It got HORRIBLE reviews yet I still enjoy it. Good psychological thriller.
---
You are right as it stands now that is the only thing you can do.
---
I do not think that any lowbies should withstand or take less dmg or spell effect from a 60. That is NOT what I am suggesting at all.
---
At the moment they do literally 0, none, nothing. This is what I find to be the problem. If they did even 5 dmg that waould be more than enough of a change. No I don't expect a lvl 20 to do any significant DMG at all but at least hit? Yes. I also want to make it clear that I am NOT suggesting that spells/effects be changed. Absolutely NOT , this would be terrible.  I think that polymoph or slows/freezes should NOT effect a 60. They should be counted as reduced heavily or just "immune". I really want to make sure everyone knows i'm strictly talking about hit % NOT effects or DMG.
---
Unfortunatelly one of the songs (my favorite on the video btw) got muted by youtube.
---
But I really enjoyed making this bad-eddited video back then :)
---
Great point. I think lock seems like it might just be a great choice. Easy leveling, easy gear, can pvp and pve well.
---
Hunters cant use maces, this hurts
---
It's not that important IMO
---
Hands down the Carrot on a stick
---
&gt; Lots of players knew about this feature, as it was posted on the WoW website it was available
---
What? No. You're thinking of the wotlk/cata feature. 
---
Well, while not being a business, TIME is the most valuable currency. Think about the OTHER 39 people's TIME. In Classic, time is a solid investment.
---
Unless you are an exceptional player AND an awesome cool guy...a Raid Leader won't give you a raid spot if you want to be a tank or dps.
---
Why? Well, first, because if he does, the next guy that is just like you (and plenty of people are like you) will ask the same treatment. And than a Shadow Priest will say : "Why are you accepting this guy as Ret in raid, and you force me to heal? I want to play as SP in raid".
---
It opens a can of worms, and all serious Raid Leader will not take a sub-optimal spec in a raid, unless, as I said, it's a damn good player and a cool and social person.
---
But that is available for serious raiding guilds only...which won't be many. Maybe 2-4 per faction per realm. All the other 30+ guilds will be casual, and they will get whatever they have...including a sub-optimal spec.
---
&gt; Imagine playing a game like Super Mario Bros and the only "reward" is the fun you are having? Oldheads know about that, younger heads less so
---
Your princess is in another castle, yo.
---
Had a hard time getting hold of original and TBC collectors on release. Didnt care for wrath or cata. 
---
Deep into cata, I found wrath and cata CE on clearance for 99 DKK each... basically 20 usd at the time. 
---
You nailed it. 
---
Exactly, but CEOs are not necessarily share holders. Most of the time, CEOs are just employed managers whose performance gets measured based on quarterly figures. This is because it is hard to measure long term success in a short term (you know, to pay out bonuses and such). And before we get into that argument: Bonuses are important incentives to motivate managers to work hard and do their job (or at least the part that can be measured) well.
---
Nostalrius shut down and classic petition were the primary drivers behind classic being developed. The whole stimulus behind blizzard saying “wait a minute, we can capture a lot the market here,” is due to the fact that private servers have done such a great job at showing Blizz that there are hordes of players clamouring to play Vanilla again. 
---
Blizzard needed it shoved in their face that so many players want this experience. To edit it and change it to be like the expansions that drove their playerbase away is a big misstep.
---
Sure, but the trend isn't only seen in CEOs. And CEOs doing it definitely helps foster a culture of doing it at all levels of upper management.
---
No one is perfect but actions have consequences.  Run the raid again next week.
---
You’re right, saying “talents” was misleading, I meant all of those changes to the actual spells and mechanics of the class as opposed to gearing issues.
---
Speed runs are speed runs because people that do it are doing it properly.
---
Probably this is why he was asked to respecc frost : because the guild wanted a SPEED run on a raid that was on easy farm status.
---
Which is absolutely acceptable to ask.
---
Sounds like a problem you simply didn’t get right the first time.
---
So many feels.
---
The other solution would be to have enough chill to just coordinate with your friends even if it means you'll be ten minutes late in getting started.
---
There are a whole lot of elitists on retail who are used to being handed gear as a reward for existing. 
---
There will always be jerks online, in one form or another. But the good news is that in Classic, only those who are actually good at the game will progress through it at a reasonable rate and all the arrogant twats will ragequit at some point in the 20-30 range. 
---
I am gonna do just like I did the first time around: Roll a paladin and ***not*** make it a healer. I expect to get lots of hate. I also expect to watch the haters beg me for heals as I bubble and dance and watch them die.
---
your example is extremely flawed and hypocritical haha 
---
Sure, not the 12+ years of us begging them for it and them deciding to do so when their retail subs were falling like crazy and they saw an untapped market that would take not that much work to capture. Believe what you like, but they are not changing it by using a different system to achieve the same goal. 
---
I was, and in fact, I haven’t subbed to WoW in over 10 years. I plan to resub solely for classic. I quit halfway through TBC because of flying mounts, LFG, and an overall movement towards dailies/redundant gameplay rather than the excellent experience of vanilla. I have maintained since I was a teen that “I will only ever play WoW again if they recreate the original.”
---
Once you get to MC the gear competition is mostly between your own class as you collect tier. Before that point you can do the Dungeon set and the upgrade to that set. The stress about gear is an overblown concern and you can do quite a lot on your own or with a small group.
---
In that case, resto druids
---
"It would be the same disaster it was in 2004 when me and all my rl friends got split up across 3 different servers."
---
You can literally solve that with a simple text any time before launch.  lol.
---
Yes.  Come on people these are quick small problems to solve lol
---
“They are not changing it by using a different system” —do you get why I have an issue with this statement? There is a CORE issue with what you are saying. You’re blatantly contradicting yourself! Doing something different is fundamentally and wholly *changing something*. 
---
ty
---
stop
---
What makes you think this poll will get different results than the other 500 times this has been posted?
---
mage beats rogue, see its like rock paper scissors. no class is unbeatable 1v in vanilla
---
I did too on a private server. They all laughed at me for rolling Dwarf, but they are my favorite race, and i was always right up there with all the other Rogues with my Perdition's Blade.
---
Well, why would the rest of the upper management have better performance measures than the CEO? If a better one had been found, it would obviously be used through as many levels of management as possible. As I said, it is really hard to measure long term success in a short time. But numbers are really easy to analyze and measure someone with. So you can only take whatever happens short-term (growth, revenue, profits, etc.) and hope that the short-term success extrapolates into the future.
---
I just want to talk about WoW. 
---
96% upvoted, I think I disagree as a rogue. This meme is so relate-able it hurts, just like an overpower to the face.
---
i can spell rowg perfectly fine thank you very much
---
gotta get ur hit chance up sorry bud! tho iirc overpower cant miss?
---
You should probably stick with Horde id say, the first time I played a pserver in 2011 after 4 years of playing bad xpacs, the old feelings came right back to me and it felt great. Thats an ally playing ally again, but I feel like it was a lot more enjoyable going back and recalling everything I knew so well. After a few years I played Horde and that was  great too, offered a bit of a fresh experience, before again going back to alliance. Im honestly at the point where I want to go back to Horde again, just for that little lack of familiarity keeps it more interesting, but it looks like most of the people I play with are going to roll ally again, well see.
---
KEEP GOING
---
Reminder to Blizzard:  Despite being the bitchiest, whiniest subreddit in the history of time, most of us ARE actually grateful and do not completely take you for granted, despite all evidence to the contrary.
---
Hey... not bad!   Usually it’s “I play a rouge so I can pwn lowbies.”
---
There was a huge backlash against phases. I don’t see the same with loot sharing.
---
I’ve got a rouge main!
---
agreed, but dont skill improved renew! put the points to better use
---
You'll be able to hear them when they make you collapse to the ground
---
I've played the first 30 levels of horde and alliance in vanilla, and while I certainly know what most zones look like after that, the content will be a big mystery! 
---
Especially the Western Plaguelands. Since it received a complete overhaul in Cataclysm I've never set foot in the original version of that zone. 
---
Yeah I don't think something like this will get changed, nor do I think many people would want it.  A level 60 can and should be able to wipe out a raid full of level 15-30 players.  Exponentially higher gear and stats, more abilities, talents, etc.  These are the things that increase a player's power, and I think the result is intended.
---
I’m not an expert, I played a warlock in vanilla to 60 like 13-14 years ago, but I think it’s a mistake. Look at the talents in the afflic tree as opposed to the demo tree. It’s not just siphon life, all of the talents along the way are great for leveling. Spell hit, improved life tap, improved drain life, IMPROVED DRAIN SOUL, etc. You would be passing on all of this to get soul link at 40? Your pet isn’t as capable as a hunters, if you are using a voidwalker for tanking boosting its damage or capabilities isn’t that great. And master demonologist gives you a nice boost to dmg IF you use succubus, but only reduced dmg done to you if you use VW, which you should be for leveling. Even if you did a respec to soul link at 40, you would be immediately without all of the crucial low-mid level afflic talents, which seem crucial to me. And once you go for those low level talents, it doesn’t make sense to stop and invest in a new tree when coming upon the strong upper ones just a few points away, including the greater range, nightfall, siphon life, and shadow mastery (10% dmg buff).
---
I’ve literally never looked at a guide or anything btw, the afflic talents just seem so strong for leveling I’m pretty confident it must be what is suggested.
---
Personal loot and problem solved. 
---
You dont see a huge backlash?  Every 3rd post is about it.  
---
I just need to know where the streamers are going.
---
A full quel thalas would be DOPE. 
---
I want casuals to play vanilla wow, but I don't want a casual mindset to influence game design choices. Vanilla strikes a good balance between the hardcore audience and the casual one. But IMO, they have moved too far towards catering to casuals, and that's why the modern game is the bland slot machine it is today. 
---
You say wow's community was one of the biggest factors in vanillas success. So why don't you leverage the community to help you? If you want to take out a level 60, spam world or guild for help. These are the systems in place to deal with shit like lvl 60 griefers. If you don't know how to leverage the community to help you, than you are missing out.
---
I understand where you're coming from though, not being able to hit a lvl 60, even for 1 damage feels bad. But I feel that this is integral to the games experience. You're damn right if I spend hundreds or thousands of hours grinding and raiding for BiS gear no lowbies should be able to touch me. I don't see that as selfish, I see it as wanting my accomplishments to hold weight. Otherwise, what’s the point?
---
Also, I believe everquest was a game that dealt with death by subtracting xp every time you died. WoW devs not including this mechanic in their game is an example of a smart QoL change that literally everybody can get behind. Fundamentally changing the way hits and misses work is too heavy handed for my liking.
---
People will say the meta is alliance. And people that roll alliance will think this 2. But if you choose horde you dont think, you know. You know horde have wf and alliance dont.
---
Yep, and your assertion that they did not have loot fixing in vanilla is ridiculous. 
---
If there are three phases:
---
1. Leveling (1 - 59)
---
2. Midgame (Fresh 60 -&gt; pre-raid BiS)
---
3. Endgame (raiding)
---
4. PVP (60 only)
---
Can other people post their opinions as replies with this format?
---
* Paladin:
---
Cool, then have fun with classic. But the idea that they did this only because of pirate servers is silly and ignores reality.
---
I'm mostly curious how many servers there'll be, and if they'll keep the original names or come up with new ones. 
---
Just don't have a funeral for your friend.. well in a pvp zone.
---
30 minute MC clear? please explain...
---
I'll gladly take an overpower to the face if it means I get to dodge hamstring, mortal strike, rend, etc
---
Asks a question, disagrees with everyone who comments.
---
If my hazy memory is correct, you only need 5% hit to cap yellow damage (abilities) from hitting a level 60 target, so in PvP you wanted +5% hit as a warrior. Any hit above that was a DPS increase in pve terms, but probably a poor allocation of stats in PvP (i.e., once you're at 5% hit, you'll get more out of other stats than additional hit in PvP)
---
Weird thing is that I was for loot trading until I considered this. Tradable loot when the majority of members are in the same clique is generally just ML with extra steps for the outsiders.
---
Did any raids ever consider kiting world bosses away from the spawn point to attempt to get the kill in secret without worrying about sudden world pvp?
---
What are you on about? They didn’t have a way to trade BoP loot after it dropped. You could get a GM involved to mediate in-game player issues, which sometimes involved redistributing loot. Why are we giving that power to players? It should be tightly controlled. The two are not the same. One is an arbiter mediating a dispute, the other is literally empowering players to decide how loot is distributed—an option that you could turn on and off in classic via ML. It wasn’t a persistent feature of the game, and it was almost never used outside of raiding.
---
Much more importantly, players want to go back to when they bought the game and relive that experience. That game. Most of us who want to play classic want the Exact. Same. Game. This whole idea is nonsensical and completely driven from a cost perspective, not from product integrity.
---
Awesome post!

Lmao

Damn straight brother

---
Are you sure??
---
Your use of pirate and not private and the constant disdain for them tells me that you don’t play on them. How long has it been since you played classic? Do you know what it feels like to have the rush of nostalgia and REMEMBERING all of the details in the game you knew so well? This is the whole point. Changing the game brings in a lot of issues with the nostalgia that players are chasing after
---
Disable character creation, game is now permadeath
---
this is correct but i was talking about overpower specifically. it cant miss right? or it can like any other abil? i thought it cant be dodged, parried, blocked or miss
---
You'll struggle to do much beyond, say, chromaggus as fights get harder and more DPS intensive after that.
---
No I am not.
---
I am saying that it was posted on the WoW webpage that it was something you could submit a ticket over.  It was common knowledge a GM could restore an item for you if you read the official WoW page.
---
That's the thing, its easy to tell for long term too.
---
Something focused on retention as opposed to something focused entirely on bringing new players in, for example. Games that focus on the short term tend to prioritize getting new players over everything else by a large margin, to the point where despite massive amounts of new players, the actual playerbase doesnt grow because the retention isnt there. The game cant keep players because they dont focus on the long term.
---
It's also easy to tell when something that is good for the short term bottom line is bad for the long term health of the game. Gacha games have plenty of examples of predatory microtransactions that will cause the company to gain a ton of money quickly, but then cause the game to fail once the novelty of the game wears thin. But by that point, the company doesnt care, they've made their money.
---
Ahh my bad! I believe it can miss, but as warriors in PvP aimed for/had 5% hit it effectively couldn't miss either 
---
This isn't about item restoration... this is about item trading. But feel free to find whatever said that if you're so sure (use archive.org)
---
oh no, it thinks that warriors would roll for blue BOE's that had spell power on them. :( it's retarded.
---
LBRS has always been a 5 man. UBRS was 15 man at launch, and then it was later lowered to 10 man.
---
Personally I'd like to see two things happen.
---
Add other expansions as new servers with the option to copy characters over so noone loses anything.
---
And add new content as an alternate expansions path, once again as new servers not upgrades to existing classic servers.
---
&gt;But IMO, they have moved too far towards catering to casuals, and that's why the modern game is the bland slot machine it is today.
---
I agree Completely
---
&gt; You say wow's community was one of the biggest factors in vanillas success. So why don't you leverage the community to help you? 
---
You are right this is a completely valid and traditional way to handle things I am grateful for this option!  
---
&gt; You're damn right if I spend hundreds or thousands of hours grinding and raiding for BiS gear no lowbies should be able to touch me. I don't see that as selfish, I see it as wanting my accomplishments to hold weight. Otherwise, what’s the point? 
---
Yep I agree again I want the respect and pride and value to be there but I cannot emphasize how small of a change / amount I am talking about. I think that there is a slippery slope to this issue if you lean too far left or right but I don't see the problem playing with the small increments in the middle. Again I'm not talking about big stuff just tiny numbers... like 1 and 2 dmg. No one should play a MMO with the expectation they will become unparalleled gods. this just does not add any value to these games and should be left to single player ones like GTA, Fable, Witcher etc. IMO
---
I second this

ok thanks for clarifying for me

What is with all the discussion about loot trading? I'm out of the loop here. If anything won't loot trading potentially increase ninja looting? For example, me and a friend are in a 5 man. He wants to ninja item so I roll too, to help him. If I win then just trade to him giving the ninja two rolls essentially.
---
Maybe I'm way off here. What are you guy's thoughts?
---
I think a lot of spec when it comes to dungeons is simply preference.  Is 10% bonus healing useful?  Yes.  Is PI useful?  Yes.  Each have their merits, and to say one is universally better than the other is short sighted.
---
The bottom line in vanilla: if you can justify the use-case of your spec, it’s not a bad spec.  I want to PvP, farm, and run dungeons in the same spec so I’m going divine spirit, spirit of redemption, and spirit tap for a while.  Is it the best?  Hell no.  But it works for all the things I want to do and I can justify every talent choice.  Unless you’re only doing one piece of content without compromising or you will respec several times a week, you have to be flexible about your talent choices.  No one knows better than you how you will play your character.
---
rEEEEEEEEEEEEEtail
---
Yeah I agree w this 100 percent. Maybe that’s not how it works on psservers but it definitely did back in the day and it will again if they say no to loot trading. This is part of the classic game for sure. If you’re a ninja you will be ostracized like in real life if you were a thief!
---
Reminder to Blizzard: you promised us you would make the release date public by March 15th. I seem to have misplaced the link where you said that. We understand you are very busy and we forgive you for forgetting that promise. If you don't have enough time to post that update today, we understand. First thing Monday morning is just fine.
---
You technically can if you want to take the tram from IF to SW then walk to northshire.
---
Guild member that I pvped with gave me his account for a couple months while he took a break. Full BWL/AQ gear while we waited for Naxx to open. I would just Target every rogue that popped up, spam hamstring/overpower all day. It was so much damn fun. 
---
Yes, you just have to walk there (take the Deeprun Tram from IF to SW). The only thing you have to be careful of is class trainers. The human area will only have class trainers for classes that humans can be. So, for example, there won't be a hunter trainer.
---
&gt;and defend Redridge. A group of levelers should be able to form up and drive out the invaders. What we have now wh
---
Absolutely how I feel!!  
---
At the way it is and has been it just eliminates and damages so many possible interactions. The scale is tipped too far to the right and prevents a lot of potential fun. Having multiple lvl 60's come to and defend a zone as opposed to.. 1 single guy... creates more need for more players and in all more social interactions and more depth in terms of faction v faction, player vs player.
---
This makes no sense at all.  If you're rushing to 60, why would you waste time farming mats to craft stuff to DE to make a wand that takes you 2 seconds to just buy off the AH.  
---
There will be thousands of people crafting this stuff.  
---
Even for a wand spec Priest..if they are rushing to 60, it would be a waste of time to do any kind of crafting.  
---
Again I see where you're coming from, but I see those little numbers as a big change so I would be opposed. I appreciate your opinion though.
---
The only difference a PvE server has is the ability to not flag as PvP in contested zones. This is the single and only difference. The game mechanics still run the same way.
---
I third this.
---
Huhu and ouro would be bad before cthun.
---
Yeah, but a good warrior will have you hamstring before evasion and just run in to MS and Overpower. 
---
your best bet would be to meet them in Westfall. unless they wait for you, they'll have out leveled and quested you by the time you get there. and you'll have to be careful of any aggressive mobs along the road too. 
---
I don't even care if Blizz hires actual people to deal with issues like this. Just make all looting outside Master Looter in raids final.
---
Yeah, it'll suck when the ninja gets away with it when you're in the group, but word will spread and they'll quickly find themselves unable to get groups.
---
Just let the community police itself.
---
&gt;My mum got to raid 
---
Asmongold? 
---
Gotcha, I plan on rolling priest for the fear ward, I am not opposed to human but I heard fear ward is a must
---
Ya the last thing I would want would be for it to be a huge change and would only want to see things implemented that are going to add positive value. For example being able to loot all of the stacks from your mail at once just makes sense and I'm glad they are patching that out. 
---
Yes you can. You will get all the same quests and rep. I did this to become exalted esily with one faction and be able to buy a mount for a different race
---
This guy fucks
---
I can assure you that the time wasted of about 15-30 mins to get the wand is overshadowed by how powerful of a tool it is while questing from 10-15. It saves time overall. I feel like again I need to remind you that on a fresh server there will be no wands on the AH. This guide is for people who want server first in their class. This guild will absolutely help them obtain a headstart in at least one area.
---
Pink or Blue?
---
I am aware of the meaning of the term. I think loot trading would be beneficial to the community. I don't understand why people are against it. It adds another level of strategy to items.
---
Thanks that’s a good idea. It’ll come down to getting the guild but it makes way more since than having two completely unrelated guilds and two schedules to work with
---
"if you think evasion istant death vs warriors because of overpower then you don't know how to play a rogue"
---
-world of rogue-craft
---
Improved renew isn't useless. It only goes off of your base heal, yes, but I wouldn't call it useless. I would much rather have that little extra healing than Spirit of Redemption, Holy Nova, or Holy Reach. Especially if my gear was crap.
---
I can only think of a few uses for Holy Nova in PvE, like on Vael maybe (depending on how bad your raid is) or in organized PvP/or getting a rogue out of stealth. I prefer Prayer of Healing.
---
Holy Reach? 10% is nothing and only affects Holy Nova and Prayer of Healing.
---
You could also stay on private servers instead of shitting on Classic when it comes out, so you can have your servers as well.
---
How could it possibly add strategy? The only functions it allows for that don't already exist are fixing Master Loot mistakes (which because of the second confirmation window needed is incredibly rare), players holding items hostage for gold (which would be dealt with by their reputation taking a hit, admittedly) or allowing groups of friends to band together to get one of them an item with no actual proof to ruin their rep with. Especially since its 1 voice vs 2-4 voices.
---
god damn it.
---
There are some points from missing flying points to simply lesser available quest then the Horde. Don't get me wrong, there are enough quest to get to the next level, but you have to wander around a lot. Grom'gol in Strangletthorn for example is a huge questing spot for the horde perfectly centered in the map. As Alliance you get a few quest in the north without a flight master. So you always have to run from Bouty Bay or from Duskwood. Ferales is another example or Desolate. You will find some quest as Alliance there, but you realy have to look for them. After level 45 the questing zones are merging again. So everyone is equal but from 33 on it's realy a pain in the ass.
---
Nice one lol
---
Incorrect assumption. Using a euphemism does a disservice to reality. They are pirate servers, there is no disputing that. I have played on them, and while some are close, they are all wrong in many ways. They don't have the correct backend, which is really what matters. You are acting as if people will not have nostalgia because instead of going to a GM for a loot issue they can just fix it? Seems pretty silly. I would worry more about the graphics and whether we will get the old models for everything, that is much more immersion breaking. 
---
I might have 3 nights a week to raid but don’t want to get too addicted and engrossed this time around. Definitely want to try PvP server this time as well, so looks like I’ll be trying two separate servers and factions and just feeling it out. Thanks!
---
Either this or just finish your newbie hub until level 5-6 then meet in goldshire and start from there.
---
it depends on how "good" your guild is and if they become bored because they already have epic mounts, lots of gold, full consumes, full enchants and all that and just want to work on an alt together..
---
if you can only get like 15-20 dedicated with you then worst case you roll through ZG / aq20 or try to pug mc / bwl.  there are ways to make it work if you want but you'd have to find the right group / people..
---
good luck! 
---
Let's take a look at each meme spec on a case-by-case basis:
---
(For PvE)
---
Druid, Boomy - Respectable dps with good gear but lacks mana efficiency so you go OOM too quickly for every fight.
---
Druid, Feral - Weak rotation and poor dps, a rogue who is afk half the time beats you.
---
Paladin, Ret - An undergeared fury warrior/rogue trumps you without trying.
---
Paladin, Prot - No taunt and poor threat generation outside of Stratholme.
---
Shaman, Ele - The best burst damage in the game and a joy in PvP, but in PvE, mana problems are your downfall. Also, good luck getting the much needed stellar gear which has priority to mage/lock.
---
Shaman, Enh - No, just no. Your dps is so atrocious that even my old friend who had nearly BiS gear including Dark Edge of Insanity off C'thun in AQ40 would not get a raid spot over any other dps class. Go have some fun in PvP.
---
(For PvP)
---
Play what you want. It's a game and you should enjoy it.
---
It's not about good or bad players. The classes listed above for PvE are just inherently weaker by a large margin and no amount of skill can overcome the lack of gear and rotation needed to outperform the raid spot that is being taken up by your low dps meme spec. Not I nor do the other 39 people want to carry your meme spec so our raid is slower and gear will still not be handed to you since priority goes to the non-meme spec classes leaving you the odd man out. Same for dungeons - don't want a team of 4.5 (vs. 5) making the dungeon slower and more painful.
---
For the record, feral druids spec'd for bear tanking is not a meme spec and are extremely viable and preferred on some encounters due to the design of their tanking and potentially higher threat ceiling. As prot MT, I gladly tanked alongside stellar bear tanks throughout Vanilla except in Naxxramas where your gear becomes too weak compared to Tier 3 warriors + thunderfury to compete in any similar manner.
---
&gt;dont you guys have phones
---
Unironically this. I would want a server list too but cmon are you lot unable to just talk to your friends for literally 5 seconds?
---
Sure man, no changes except the changes you want. GM's were not fixing a dispute, they were moving loot from one person to another with the consent of both. The same thing this system does. I'm sorry that you are so stuck on how different it is that you can't see it is functionally identical. 
---
You want no loot fixing at all? That's a change from vanilla, I want to play vanilla, not this fascist no loot fixing nonsense this sub seems intent on having.
---
What is your contribution?
---
During classic it was the most op racial for pve. It helps a lot, when you only have to equip one main tank and not two for fear switching.
---
While I'm still struggling with class, I've decided the race and server: Night Elf, RP. 
---
Night Elf was the first race I played, and it's been my favorite since then. Plus Teldrassil and Darkshore are awesome. 
---
Server was a lot harder. First I was debating PvP or non-PvP. PvP is a lot more immersive, and there's nothing comparable to when a small skirmish develops into an all out war. But a commenter on another thread said they wouldn't play, because "they didn't have the time", and that stuck with me. At my core what I want the most is to level, explore and relax. PvP can be fun, but you also have to deal with ganking, and in the worst cases it can lock you out of quests and areas for hours. I don't think i want to deal with that. Then there's the fact that some zones aren't as exploration friendly, like Stranglethorn Vale. Lastly PvP servers can be sensitive to things like faction balance, and game progression. Maybe it's fun to play the first six months, but when everyone has reached sixty a lot of those impromptu events risk disappearing, at least at early levels. 
---
Then it was RP vs Normal, which was easier to decide. Since I started I've always been interested in RP-esque actives, such as dressing up in nice looking gear, walking through towns and being part of the world. I'm also very casual, won't be raiding or doing PvP, so RP adds something to the end game. People having sensible names is gonna be satisfying. 
---
Only thing left to decide is Druid or Hunter. 
---
inb4 improved blizzard joke
---
Dwarf Paladin. I just feel this is my world of warcraft identity. Race/Class fantasy is the perfect mix for me.
---
It was also the first character I played the first time I played WoW
---
I'd say on Ally side hpaladins are so effective at their job they eat raidspots from druids.
---
Serte explains it pretty well why it might not be such a great idea.
---
Yeah, we should all roll human males, because RL
---
Lofi memes aren't a new thing. 
---
So would you be against an OSRS approach to  Classic? OSRS is flourishing and is more popular than RS3 if I recall correctly. 
---
Would != could. There's no change.
---
Go sober up you're embarrasing yourself.
---
Where is his wife?
---
/spit.
---
Because it's Alliance.
---
There's a lot wrong with what you've said. I think you need to do more research into what vanilla was and what it wasn't. Based on what i'm seeing here, you're not cut out for this job yet. Sorry man. 
---
Aside from things like demonology warlocks and two feral druids, or group comps being wrong, you'll realize you probably won't have the option to say "I need this number of this class". Instead it will be closer to, "okay who is online and ready to raid".
---
I think most of them would prefer to go through the patches as they had happened back in the day, but that isn't really possible according to Blizz, so we take what we can get.
---
Nice! I'm thinking healing class or mage for the free food and water
---
Literally no hostility. Those were different times. There weren’t databases tracking their specs, or even databases tracking damage output averages to tell you the best spec. I played beast master hunter in pvp when spirit link was the final talent. Literally no one did that. And I did well, and got a lot of recognition from my opponents for doing something that was not common. 
---
There is no such thing as "retail classic".
---
Your last paragraph hits the nail on the head for me.
---
I’m 100% for sharding in your example/instance. I’m fine with sharding if it’s used cautiously.
---
I’m excited for the game, but I want to be able to play the game. I’m all for the tedium and the slow-burn nature, I’m all for the long grinds, but what I do want is to be able to PLAY. Not be restricted from that.
---
Sharding is perfectly fine if done in a limited scope for a limited time.

I've already relearned what I like to play from private servers. Typically it was mostly Druid and Hunter but tested several other classes and decided to return to my original 1st 60 in Wow ... Shaman.
---
It's my favorite support class and I can stomach raiding with it. Elemental is my love though.
---
This is one of MANY things GM’s did. Are you saying that WoW classic will not have GM’s and no customer support? Can you link where this was said?
---
If this is in fact the case, the problem is much bigger than loot trading.
---
Look man, I get that you want good things for the game. There’s a whole bunch of us that just don’t even want to dip our feet in any sort of change to the game, we want it to remain the same game we remember and stroll trough memory lane without having to constantly talk about “back in vanilla, we didnt have loot fixing integrated into party mechanics, we had to contact a GM and wait 3 days! You actually had to be careful when you killed a boss!” We want to experience the same pains and the same highs.
---
You shouldn’t be rallying behind blizzard’s cost reduction methodology to get what was originally a part of the game experience, because they don’t want to pay for the game that will bring back all of their subs.
---
You are mistaken.  At level 60 Warlocks are Mushroom, Rogues are scissors, Warriors are rock and also scissors, and everyone else is paper.  Scissors beats paper, but rock can’t see scissors since it is steathed.
---
Very nice!! And takes me back right there, to playing through those quests. I loved them at the time, found the area to be creepy, and this brings back the feeling.
---
Luckily new players dont raid, so they have time.  Regardless, though, raids will eventually be pugged and this idea breaks down.

---
Not only are these links, as I'm sure you will admit, absolutely hidden away and is not something most players would've ever seen (it was not posted as a news item or anything). They also do not say anything about reimbursing items that someone else needed on by mistake. The closest thing is that they say they _may_ restore items due to "user error". It doesn't mention other people's user errors, just your own. It could be interpreted to allow trading missrolled items, but it definitely doesn't say that in any clear way.

"The Vanilla journey of my Dwarf warrior"  
---
First pic is a night elf. I lol'd  
---
I mentioned in a previous post, how my friends and I were total noobs. We hadn't trained skills since around level 10ish and had no idea about talent points. I was even a feral druid, who hadn't done any of the quests for my forms yet. Anyway, we were questing in Darkshire. Forget what level we were. When someone discovered a path that went into the mountains in the center of the map. We were super curious, and went exploring. We were in awe at the giant portal looking thing we found. We started to run to it to check it out when we noticed a fucking dragon walking twords us. We got super excited and attacked! We wanted to fight the dragon like true adventurers....at best the dragon fought us. It was over so fast! It wasn't until after that we noticed the skull next to its name. Lol Ahhh, super noobs.

I would call it piracy if Blizzard actually sold the IP that their copyright protects. When classic comes out, then yeah, I’ll pay for it and stop “stealing” the product that Blizzard doesn’t even sell. 
---
I don't hate this.
---
i gonna play roge because i'm too tired of tanking for years on live and too lazy to level warr or pala
---
What do you call 2004-2006 WoW then?
---
min/maxers know the game intimately and tend to correct people when they do something wrong, I think generally it is well intentioned. But, sometimes their methods are not the most friendly. So I think even if a min/maxer thinks they are trying to help they can sometimes come off as condescending and that's led to casual players "inferiority complex".
---
I still might change my mind, but im very strongly leaning towards Dwarf Priest.  Its either that or a warlock, but i REALLY want to play a Dwarf.
---
Also having to farm shards as a lock was miserable enough in Wrath when i had soulwell.  Without that i think i'd go crazy.
---
My desire to be a Dwarf really sealed it though, and i dont mind healing...plus i figure theres always a need for it, so it should work out well for me, and finding groups for dungeons while leveling should be a lot easier.
---
I will be playing a gnome mage on a PvE server.
---
Reasons:
---
Server - I began playing on PvE and later on PvP. While I believe the experience of playing the game is superior playing on pvp where you feel "at war," I am over a decade older than I was when I began playing and the time restraints that come with responsibilities will catch up with me.  Therefore, when I am able to play, I dont want my fun amd experience mucked up by someone ganking and unnecessary corpse runs. I have to be efficient with the limited time I have, and I believe PvE will give me that better.
---
Faction - I am playing alliance because my girlfriend expressed interest in playing with me and did not like any of the models for the horde, until blood elves perhaps. Also, I began on Alliance so that doesnt bother me.
---
Class - I am playing a mage because I enjoy playing a dps class. I mained an enhancement shaman from TBC through Cata. But shamans arent available to Alliance, nor are enhancement shamans that good for raiding in vanilla. Mages have great dps, great movement (portals), free food/water to save for that epic mount I never had in vanilla last time. 
---
Race - really human vs gnome is a toss up. I ended up gnome because I want to min/max more for raiding and believe the 5% int more beneficial than spirit.  Perhaps their escape is also more useful than perception. The bonus to human is less rep grinding since I indicated to be efficient with my time, but I expect to want to be raiding more and rep grinds can get themselves eventually.
---
I only have experience leveling as horde, and the barrens are where I think we would need sharding most. You have several races all leveling in this same zone.
---
Yeah probably.
---
This looks fucking awesome! 🤯
---
Not if you've chosen to go Hunter since Elwynn has no hunter trainers (unless one is in The Park?) Humans can be every class a Dorf can aside from Hunters.
---
Troll hunter, but possibly orc hunter. I was torn between hunter/druid/warlock/priest, so I tried leveling up each class on a private server. 
---
I did not like priest in practice, so that got nixed; warlock was fun but I hated not having any move speed buffs. Ultimately I decided I'd rather DPS over heal in raids, I'm not huge on tauren, I don't like being shapeshifted all the time so I can't see my gear/character, and I think the hunter tier sets look better. Gameplay wise both are extremely fun IMO, and the decision came down almost exclusively to aesthetics. That, and I love the hunter pet mechanics.
---
RP-PvP is where I'll most likely end up, hopefully I can find an NA guild raiding on there that needs a hunter. I want a PvP server, but from what I've heard RP has a more mature player base and fewer power gamers/griefers.
---
First of all, it's all the same portal. There was no way to limit the amount of people between one or the other. L and U were just names given to the different wings by the community.
---
&gt;UBRS was 15 man at launch, and then it was later lowered to 10 man.
---
"At launch", there was no limit on the dungeon. You could have 40 people zoned into BRS or BRD, because that was the only way to zone into MC proper and they were originally going to make us zone into BWL through bRS.
---
Well, *some* PvE gear to PvP was still a staple either in tbc or wotlk, the latter being absolutely broken due to the new human racial (which was a PvP trinket for free, allowing you to use 2 high end trinkets at a minimal resilience cost). 
---
The same actually the opposite of what you say is also true: unless you have mostly PvP gear (namely a resilience threshold, specially if on a durable/self-healing class) you'll be roflstomped unless you can avoid pretty much *all* the enemy's attacks (by outranging, stunlocking...). Few classes can do so  and the ones suffering harder are precisely the ones requiring higher resilience. 
---
Reminding is very important and makes your opinion sound like you are representing a whole community.
---
I'm not going to go as far as saying you are stealing anything, because you are right that they don't support the product. However it is still 100% piracy.
---
I enjoyed this!
---
Alright, there are a few things here:
---
* Retention and growth of a games player base: How do you measure this long term, if you only have current numbers? Sure, you can see from one time-interval to the next how the numbers changes. But you still do not necessarily know why these numbers developed in the way they did. Is it a new release? Has there been some change in the game? Did a competing product fail? etc. And who is responsible for the development of the changing amount of players? Is it a manager? Which manager? Or is it exogenous? There are a lot of variables and getting to the bottom if this is really expensive, as well as the result questionable.
---
* Depending on the kind of game, retention does not necessarily even mean anything. Most "traditional" games are not there to have people playing them very long. Have fun, finish them once and you are done. Retention is only important if you want a repeated revenue stream, like from subscriptions or micro transactions. And whoever makes these games and decides on "short term" is really stupid because the most money is not done through initial sales, but through the repeated subscriptions or micro transactions. I really doubt anyone makes this kind of decision knowingly.
---
* How do you know whether or not something is focused just for the short run? If anything a game will be about selling as many copies as quickly as possible, but this does not mean you focus on a "short-term" game. You might be cutting costs, and forcing development to fit some marketing criteria. But as long as it sells, anything goes. And who keeps buying lazy products over and over again? So if you think about it, it's on the consumers as much as it's on the managers.
---
* How do you measure soft things, which are also extremely important for the health of a company? You know, certain decision that were made to cut costs for example. Not only do you have to go through every decision that has been made and rate them somehow, but you also have to predict how it might play out.
---
* Your example of Gacha games seem to work for them (so far). But again, if this is a trend for that company and people still keep falling for it again and again ... well, what do you expect? There will always be people to capitalize on the stupidity of others. But still, short-term decisions do not always mean that it's bad in the long run. What if the firm gets into financial trouble and the only way to stay in business is to lay off workers? That's definitely a decision for a short term bottom line. But from that point on the firm can grow again.
---
Human warrior, protection. Main tank.
---
Tauren warrior PvP server.  Tauren best tank imo from Stam buff.  PvP cuz it’s most fun.
---
That's when I blizzard, but when do I use my activision spell?
---
It’s used because all the other posts that disagree use “we”.  It’s a counter-thread.
---
Generally speaking the two DPS specs can go 30 points deep into their respective DPS trees, then 21 points in Resto for Nature's Swiftness.  The reason this is good for both is that instead of getting the 31 point talent (Elemental Mastery or Stormstrike) you're promoting more diversity in your ability to respond to threats with Nature's Swiftness (the 21 point talent in Resto.
---
As Elemental, your talent points in resto and nature are very synergistic and you'll have insane crit chance on your lightning spells.  The ability to instant cast a Chain Lightning or Healing Wave as both Elemental or Enhancement is so strong and it provides  you a life-saver in situations you would otherwise be screwed in. 
---
(I.e. A mage ready to counterspell your nature spells)
---
Overall your PvP strength is versatility.  Your PvE strength is utility.  Together it makes shaman the quintessential "Jack of all Trades"
---
My favorite is when they use frostbolt when there's 5 mobs, and then when the last mob is alive they switch to blizzard.
---
ABSOLUTELY nO DWARFS ALLOWED IN THE SHIRE 
---
-human
---
In that case you can get the priest abilities from the human trainers, but will need to go to Ironforge for Fear Ward.
---
This scratches the surface of how excited I am for classic. 
---
Gold
---
They should keep some "pure" Classic servers set aside if for no other reason than to be preservation projects.  If they then launch separate Classic+ servers where they experiment with changes and new content, I'm 100% okay with it.  If anything, I'd probably *like* that and want to play them!
---
He'll have autoshot and a group.  He's good.
---
I would prefer none of this, but I live in reality and this kind of crap will happen. I would love to be right there beside you playing the game just as it was in 2005, but that isn't possible. There will be GM's, but a system like this takes a load off the ticket system. Instead of 100 GM's (Not real number, illustrative) they can pay 50 GM's since this loot nonsense is not going to be an issue like it was.
---
I am not rallying behind the change, I don't like it either but I am aware that there are levels of bad and this is not that bad. Without cost reductions classic would still not exist, the whole point is that classic needs to be profitable for us to have it for a long time, and have any chance of seeing things like classic TBC. If that means that we deal with this system to automate things GM's used to do then so be it, if they were suggesting personal loot or some nonsense then I would be right beside you with the pitchforks.
---
They specifically use vague language to avoid committing to anything they can't keep.
---
They don't restore any item, it must have met specific criteria in order to be restored (for example, you were at the raid and loot eligible) 
---
The thing is even before this was posted (an earlier version in 2004 doesn't have a restoration policy) players were ticketing GMs asking for item restorations anyways.  Blizzard has and always will view this as something they need to address, since they receive so many tickets on the issue.
---
The only trinket that can deal with deathcoil is a shadow reflector, no pvp trinkets dispell horror effects.
---
It started with "I refuse to heal because I'm tired of being shoehorned into healing despite being a good shadow priest or elemental shaman". Then I went "I also refuse to tank because for once I'd like to raid where the only thing I have to worry about is myself and my own mechanics". So that cut my options to the only pure DPS classes available. Hunter, Rogue, Mage, Warlock. I cut Hunter out because I don't like them very much in Vanilla, even if they are solid for leveling. I cut out Rogue because I don't like Combat Swords and I don't like PVP. That left Mage or Warlock. Initially i was going to go with Warlock because pet class, cheaper mount, and my last raiding main on live was a Mage. However, what actually finalized my decision was the knowledge that, in the early days of WoW, pre 1.4 at least, you could not become exalted with the Darkspear Trolls. This means the only people who could ride Raptors were Trolls. So if I wanted my Mottled Red Raptor (which to date still doesnt have anywhere close to a comparable replacement, unlike the Ivory and Bone White Raptors), I had to be a Troll, thereby cutting out Warlock as an option.
---
So Troll Mage. I might still maybe go Troll Hunter to not be a caster, but it's unlikely.
---
Do you do that on live?  We’ve had loot trading for years without rampant abuse.
---
Just keep in mind there's a run time and factor that in.  It might be easier to meet later when you've got to do some running or you're at the city already anyway.
---
I wanna get the mallet and do a full ZF run.
---
Haha. To be honest I’m excited to level a profession (tailoring I think) with my character so that I can make significant improvements for myself as I go. (I.e. professions to be relevant to levelling again). Also Thousand Needles, Barrens, Darkshore and Loch Modan pre cataclysm.
---
Earthshaker!
---
Thank you for helping :)
---
Honestly I feel it's about a 75% chance to get a good group on P-Servers, and those are good odds. I've met people there who are fantastic. First time I ever healed I was so nervous I was shaking, but the Pally helped me through and put in some support heals. Similarly first time I tanked was also my first time in Stockades, and people were super nice, even pointing out mechanics. 
---
I feel the key is being honest about it. If you're new and nervous, don't be afraid to say so in the chat. That way people will be much more forgiving and help you out. 
---
Then there's other things to consider that can help out. PvE and RP servers tend to be more casual friendly than PvP. DPS classes will be easier to manage compared to Druid, Paladin, Shaman and Warrior who will be expected to heal or tank. And of course guilds, that's an important one. 
---
&gt; Based on what i'm seeing here, you're not cut out for this job yet. Sorry man.
---
This is exactly why I started this thread. Any feedback is appreciated. Especially if you have experience as a leader/officer: Is that so?
---
&gt; Aside from things like demonology warlocks
---
Warlocks are typically specced into DS/Ruin during higher progression since the Succubus sacrifice scales with gearing and Shadow Mastery does not.
---
&gt;  two feral druids,
---
This is why I posed a question above regarding this. Usually hardcore guilds only bring 1 offtank feral (if at all) because of the advantages and flexibility over bringing an additional Prot Warrior. 3-4 tanks being the standard I assumed it would be fine to bring 2, and also I don't like having a single player having a unique spec in the raid because then it cant be compared and is harder to substitute if that player is missing. This is also the reason I'am not considering bringing a single shadowpriest as many are suggesting because out of experience players get lenient if they don't have anyone to be compared to. Feral druids specifically need a high amount of preparation and attention during raids.
---
&gt; you'll realize you probably won't have the option to say "I need this number of this class". Instead it will be closer to, "okay who is online and ready to raid"
---
I've played in both kind of guilds and know the advantages/disadvantages of both styles. I know what leads to each. I have zero doubts that a player who is tryharding the f*k out of this role like me and is not afraid to ask the right questions will be successful.
---
Arguably intentionally having 1 feral druid tank isn't a terrible idea; ***If you know someone who is good and wants to play a feral druid tank already.*** It actually does help smooth gear progression out considerably, and they are not bad 3rd or 4th seat tanks; they also have higher threat generation, and can get high resistances.
---
But it requires you to ***really know your shit***, and you shouldn't be actively recruiting 2 of them. If you have someone you really trust who really believes they can make it work, they probably can; and people have historically been able to do it. They don't work in every fight, and it's a bitch to play because you need to grind that stupid hammer from gnomer all day, but they can be viable.
---
The rest of the stuff about class/spec restrictions and the healer distributions is just way off and shows OP isn't familiar with coordinating 40 mans though.
---
It’s not that everyone who plays Classic is a saint. It’s that the game encourages companionship and strong bonds *through* it’s features. People who play classic aren’t any better than other gamers, but the community is excellent because of the features, or lack of features in some cases.
---
Do you still stand by your statements
---
Let's do a poll on how many people are sick of these polls and discussions about "after Classic" when we haven't even gotten Classic outside of a short unfinished demo.
---
Scarlet Monastery
---
Fucking beautiful
---
Honestly.. remake all of the content without the incredibly stupid changes. 
---
I would like to see you complete this guide in a video from dinging level 5 to Lesser Magic Wand in hand.  I would be curious to watch the guide in action and see how long it takes.  As a warlock, I would be interested to see this.  I also plan to start Classic as soon as it releases and level as fast as possible, so I will be curious to see how right or wrong you are about no wands on the AH.  
---
Westfall for alliance and barrens for horde
---
Hillsbrad Foothills.  I can't wait for those initial few weeks where there aren't a lot of bored 60s, so the pvp is going to be crazy.  Redridge/STV as well.
---
Its still really early for that. I wouldnt mind the list getting released like a month before, thats still plenty of time to set everything up and prepare
---
The good ol' elimination strategy. An interesting choice to, didn't think to factor in mounts. Raptors are the coolest mounts in the game, no question. 
---
It's a similar train of thought that makes me consider hunter. I love Druid, but I don't know if I can handle tanking and healing. I just wanna relax.
---
I would say druid, hunter, warlock. Druids dont get many spots in the raid. Probably 2 druids tops. The problem is even though you can get your tier gear, theres a lot of healing gear thats better that isn't tier. And good luck getting that over the other stronger healers. If youre okay with suboptimal gear and are happy with your set, druid is great. 
---
Hunter is second because their tier sets are bis. So you're only competing against other hunters which there really wont be many of (not because people dont play it, but because raids dont want too many). Id say 2-4 tops. Plus youre only competing against other hunters for your ranged weapon.
---
And finally warlock for the same reason as druid. There just usually arent that many people playing warlock so you can get your tier pretty quick. That being said its not bis/optimal gear. And you will be competing against arguably more important dps (mages) for the non set gear. But if you just want the sets you should be good.
---
Xfire!  That was a throwback. 
---
When did they say this or are you just being silly lol? I don't remember hearing this before but I really hope its true.
---
&gt; it's way too hard to get pvp epics in vanilla 
---
This is the issue, along with them being awkward for certain classes (mostly hybrids). 
---
But, anyway I don't consider that PvP and PvE gear should be split.  There should be alternatives. 
---
WPvP when farming/roaming in the world also gets punished with it, favoring even more the instanced alternatives. Only instanced PvP stays fine.
---
I still have 2 pair of these in the grandfathered format on my 39 twink shaman. I cant wait too farm twink boe gear and sell it again!
---
It's also the truth...
---
Actual reminder: Use arcane explosion instead for higher DPS
---
None may challenge the brotherhood.
---
I love that combo. Few things are more frightening than seeing a fully armored massive bull charging at you while you're picking flowers. 
---
Let the extra gold work for you. Let it bring you even more gold ;)
---
Wetlands! It's my favorite zone, although I'm pretty hype to get south shore back as an alliance quest hub 
---
No word yet. Tons of hope.
---
It's a unique project. The content is already developed. They are using a proven engine. They are basically just porting information over and adjusting things. It's hard to say how much testing is required externally.
---
My minimal guess is that Blizzard will have at least 1-2 stress test weekends that tests launch stability and for promotion. Anything more is a huge bonus.
---
They had to remove weather effects in cataclysm because it wasnt compatible with the new engine upgrades with light shafts and volumetric smoke.
---
There is a risk that we wont see weather effects in classic.
---
Honestly, doing full Stratholme runs.  Especially later on when you have 45 min baron runs.  Those are so much fun and challenging!
---
Experience isn't enjoyment it's a measurement of time and investment. 
---
PvE servers have nothing to do with the argument of fairness in PvP. And you bringing up power disparities is a argument made against yourself. If you think anyone in epics cannot one-shot someone in greens you're delusional. The amount of health is non-consequential.
---
No changes is a package deal. If you want "anything" then you don't want classic, especially if you're that kind of person who gets to pick and choose what people should enjoy and what not.
---
something to be aware of is the level 6 priest quest I don't know if you can do that in the human area as a dwarf.. I could be mistaken but I think I remember that from somewhere. 
---
The evocation spell animation. In TBC it got changed from this awesome swirling magic effect to "Druid's new Cyclone graphic, except blue and upside-down!" I've hated it ever since.
---
Ni hao
---
Still waiting for the quote
---
Something I've never played, in an underpowered spec. I've had a weird thing for min/maxing underpowered specs my entire wow career. 
---
It's been so long I legitimately can't even remember anything past Tanaris as far as what zone for what level range (horde side). Which I'm intentionally allowing myself to sort of have the "first time" experience again this time around and not looking everything up.
---
Anyways, probably Tanaris: Pirates in the coast, giant rollinf [seemingly endless] desert, ZF, you just got your mount (hopefully). Good Times.
---
FFS get the adds first! That brings back memories more than anything else.
---
Not very sure about this phasing, the raiding is very different from MC to Naxx and the most effective classes vary pretty much all the way through. Would at least use MC to BWL and AQ to Naxx
---
My female gnome warrior started in vanilla as a joke. In TBC I played her because druid/war was OP in 2v2. I enjoyed her enough that in Wrath she became my main and I went on to get Shadowmourne.  
---
I as the only geared gnome warrior on my server. Being a little gnome holding Shadowmourne was enough that people knew who I was.  
---
As /u/Illogicalpanda said in this thread. It became my identity.  
---
I'm remaking her for Classic.  
---
I will have enough free time that I'll be able to main two characters. So I'll also be focusing heavily on a gnome warlock, which is a recreation of my TBC main.  
---
I don't remember the quote, I'm simply asking you if you agree or disagree with what he said.
---
What *did* he say?
---
Easier than my Nelf ass getting meeting my friends there 
---
Restoring yes. But we're not talking about restoring.
---
Google it?
---
I'm pretty sure his friends can wait the 20 minutes it's going to take him to get to Northshire.  
---
This is what life is all about
---
I keep reading the advice to not level tailoring/enchanting while leveling your character, but idk...honestly i still might do it.  It kinda feels 'right' to keep up with it as much as you can while leveling.
---
how so?
---
I'll try that next. I just figured for such a passionate group of people, ya'll would actually remember what he said.
---
Clearly that isn't the case.
---
Mage is gonna be better for everything except solo leveling(until huge aoe damage) and rogues. Warlock DoTs fuck rogues up.
---
You can do whatever you want, but as others have suggested, it's probably easiest to do the starting areas seperately and meet afterward. It won't take long to hit level 5 and meet at a new quest hub, like Goldshire.
---
Shhhhh! You'll ruin everything! 
---
Problem is all healers fight for same gear (we all wear dresses) and in mc and bwl rings and neck whit all casters. Hunters actually uses the thier gear and you are most likely to have only 4 of them so easily the easiest class to gear
---
Tried Warlock on a P-Server, and while the fearing and dotting was fun the lack of movement was infuriating. Not to mention the Soul Shards. 
---
Hunter by comparison is so much smoother. Easy to pick up but challenging to master, fun involved mechanics with pets, no worry about tanking/healing, overall smooth and relaxing experience. And I just can't overstate how much fun the pet mechanics is. 
---
As for race, another commented picked his based on mount (specifically the original Mottled Red Raptor) so maybe that can help decide. 
---
It wouldn't lol. What's what I meant.
---
Technically your characters are still alive if you log on to retail using the same login info. But they wouldn't end up on new classic servers.
---
Dude has a voice made for Barry White monologues. 
---
I think he meant least invited to raids.
---
"[Overpower](http://classicdb.ch/?spell=11585)" is often used against Rogues.
---
Rogues are the most *overpowered* class.
---
Most of us remember it verbatim. He said essentially that loot trading was a modern system to ensure fairness over loot, and also alleviates a big burden off of in-game gamemasters who would otherwise have to sort out loot troubles. He didn't speak anything regarding how the loot trading system might be abused.
---
Duskwood. 100%
---
Can't wait to do the Abercrombie quest chain with that abomination terrorizing the road. He's an absolute unit.
---
I don't care about decisions made like firing workers to keep the company afloat and things like that. I'm talking purely about decisions regarding the health of the game.
---
You measure retention by seeing how many people have stopped playing, how many subs have dropped. Incoming players and total playerbase numbers are irrelevant to judging player retention. If you want to keep players invested, you want do things that lower the amount of quitting players to as low as possible, not things that bring in new players to replace those who leave.
---
I bring up Gacha because predatory business models are very common there. As an example, they will release a new character who is by far the best character in the game and will be the new face of the meta for months, and the only way to unlock that character is to drop $200-$400+ depending on how lucky you are on loot boxes. This kind of practice is super common in that industry. Yes, those who buy into it arent very bright, but humans as a whole are a stupid animal and nothing will change that. There will always be idiots who do those things, so companies will continue to try and prey on them. The issue lies when they focus so much on that sort of thing that the base product they produce becomes actively awful, like current WoW.
---
You can tell whether something is focused on the short term or the long term based on whether its focused on player retention or playerbase growth. Any decision based on playerbase growth is a short term decision, particularly in cases like this, where you already have an established playerbase. Decisions based on keeping that playerbase are long term decisions.
---
And while it may seem like keeping people playing is what an MMO wants to do, it actually isn't. They want people to still be subbed, but they don't care if the person actually is playing, just that the subscription isn't cancelled. So the player that logs in once a week for an hour or two to do a couple of dailies and weeklies is better for them than the player who is playing 4-5 hours per day. They both give the same money and one requires less effort from their part to keep their attention.
---
B-b-but LOOT TRADING??? Amirite??? right click reporting!!!! Me no play game if this in game!!! Me play other game!!!
---
That... kind of sounds like a great idea. I've been Horde main for almost my entire game time. Dabbled in a few Alliance alts that never got past 20, and race-changed to Alliance during Wrath whihc is sort of cheating since you don't get the leveing experience. I still want to try to relive my first days in Classic and watch Mulgore unfurl again, but maybe I'll try this, and roll Ally
---
More specifically, gathering all that juicy gear for when my shaman hits 40.
---
&gt; Most of us remember it verbatim.
---
That's not what verbatim means. Verbatim means exactly what he said.
---
After thinking about your suggestion it actually like it a lot, allthough I will cut the shadowpriest for sure and let a holy do the Shadow Weaving. What I don't like is that the priests can't use their shields / prayer in this, which is not a huge deal since both spells are highly situational anyways, I personally healed with using neither of them ever but I thought it would be nice to have as an option. I also don't see a huge argument to have a shaman in a mage group, I never played a mage but I assumed it would be enough to spam consumables for them.
---
Shaman:
---
Leveling 1-59: multi purpose role (dps or heal), good movement speed early on. Great for duo leveling
---
Fresh 60 is great, all specs scale great early on. Gearing out will be easiest for resto, with some pieces being good for ele aswell. Enhance you will get what others do not want.
---
PVP is fun on both ele and enhance. Resto is not great in PVP. The famous Ele/Resto spec is godly if played properly. Your team will love you as a bursty battle healer.
---
Endgame raiding, everyone wants good shaman healers. Finding a raid is always easy. 8 shaman per raid. 
---
Im really, really looking forward to seeing the Loch go back to its beautiful, serene ways!
---
Not a questing zone, but it'll be fun to see the SW park again.  I dont remember jack shit about it :(
---
Old Darkshore will be nice to see again....and while i might not 'like' it as much, the old....creepier...plaguelands will be interesting to experience again after almost a decade.
---
Thousand Needles/Tanaris back in their old non flooded glory will be nice.  Idk that ill be questing there a ton (I guess ill be in Tanaris at least, i expect), but seeing the racetrack again will be really neat.
---
One of my fondest memories is an event that caused Lord Kazzak to spawn right outside orgrimmar.  He constantly spams AoE shadowbolts, which for any of the lowbies in the area is instant death.  Compound that with the fact that he heals for 25k HP whenever he kills someone....yeah.  I climbed up on a hill to get a nice vantage point to watch the circus.  Nothing like watching the top guild on your server beat the shit out of a world boss only to watch him heal to full as a herd of lowbies gets off the zeppelin.  
---
An interesting perspective. Always happy to see more Gnomes. I feel you made the right decision, the +int is gonna be a constant bonus no matter what you do, while the reputation is more situational. 
---
&gt; shows OP isn't familiar with coordinating 40 mans though.
---
You can also figure that out by reading the post because I specifically stated that being the reason why I made it in the first place.
---
Appreciate the feedback on feral druids though.
---
i'm triggered
---
I could talk about this shit for hours.
---
I love stump
---
I've leveled a Warrior up to 45, using a combined spec of Fury and Arms, but 2H aimed. 
---
But I wonder what are the DW benefits over 2h specifically for leveling. I'm simply aiming for a DPS build that will also give me a chance to survive in world PvP until i'm 60.
---
It just adds more to the game if youre not diehard speed running.
---
Thanks Sherlock. Try putting your detective skills to use and reading the entire discussion. 
---
Negative, I completed all raids in vanilla retail and got KT xbow. I also was an average player in a guild of amazing players like [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAR1CsAXLCw&amp;t)
---
Even on the most melle favored raid boss of all time, Patchwerk I managed to get #10 . . [Hulk was #1 of course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qndf5vMuvlc). BUt not by an extreme amount like on private servers, he had around 30% more dps than me, on private servers the top warrior gets like 200% more than the top hunter. 
---
MC/BWL I was a Tier 1 dps, competing for the Top 5 spot in nearly ever boss fight except a few for example Nefarian, due to the massive add 1st phase which mages/locks/warriors dominated. On any single target fight like the drakes I was always in Top 5. 
---
AQ added more add fights alongside no weapon upgrades which hurt and I felt like a Tier 2 dps in AQ. And Tier 2 in 1st half of Naxx. With a lot of the upgrades in Naxx and AQ(Tier 2.5) I started to get to Tier 1 dps in late Naxx, climaxing with a #5 spot in our Four Horsemen kill, which is the hardest raid boss in all of Classic. I did shitty on Saph due to frost gear but did ok on KT. 
---
Including myself you're the third so far who've considered hunter vs druid. I wonder if there's a reason for that.
---
But good choice! Never got the chance to play Shaman, but I've been tempted to make my first alt one. Their raid sets are among my favorites. 
---
I wish OP was playing on Horde side.
---
I always wanted to know what "Lok'tar Ogar" sounds like in French.
---
You can level in any starting zone of your faction. I would suggest though, that you pick a class that has access to trainers in that starting zone.
---
I leveled a Mage 1-20 in Teldrassil/Darkshore for reputation and it was very inefficient since I had to buy portals to another town and hearth back.
---
As someone who played a Shaman back in the day - I hit 60 in Vanilla and continued on my Shaman through BC - it's the most fun class in the game from 1-59. They're still a lot of fun in PvP and 5 mans at level 60. You're a legitimate hybrid and support class in small groups and PvP.
---
They're kind of a bummer to play in raids though. You (along with Paladins) are a healer and only a healer in raids. Even *Priests* are more viable as damage dealers than a Shaman against a raid boss, while Druids fill the hybrid role more effectively.
---
For that reason, I will be playing Druid as my main this time around. I'm still going to make a Shaman alt, but I won't invest as much time into it as I did back in the day. 
---
You absolutely can, and it’s super easy, just get the tram it will take you 10 mins tops 
---
Yeah man this. 45 mins runs was a challenge but it was awesome. 
---
Blackrock Mountain. That zone is so much fun it's unreal. The pvp battles to be had there are next to none.
---
Other than that, I'd say Ashenvale or Hillsbrad, because that's the first places we'll be able to size up the horde on our server.
---
100% agree! The whole atmosphere of that zone and especially the town was amazing! 
---
Yeah, I know and these changes do impact the game &amp; make it more difficult - I’m more interested in the REAL armor values, because I honestly think the armor is OVERtuned on pservers. Which is a huge deal. 
---
My guild is actually doing Horseman tonight without world buffs and flasks from lotus to make it even harder than it was back in day -
---
We honestly annihilated horseman, 2 shotted it.  1 Tank D’cd on first pull -
---
So even without flasks I don’t think it will be too bad. Our raid is adequately geared, not over geared. this will be our  3rd week in Naxx. 
---
We’re a casual raiding guild only raid2 nights a week for 3 hours each night. Both night are for Naxx though because it’s a large place honestly 
---
Seriously, I went hunter first and it might have tainted my view of the other 3. Leveling a hunter is unparalleled levels of smoothness and ease, while also being extremely fun with lots of micro.
---
To be fair warlock multi pulls with fear tanking and drain tanking are also super fun, as well as stance dancing druids; but there's just something about the massive hunter toolbox that I really enjoy.
---
I thought about what sounded the most fun and decided to play it
---
You basically asked which of the 9 classes peaks at every stage of the game. We could practically write a doctoral thesis on that subject, it's almost too wide for this discussion forum.
---
Getting my epic nightsaber mount!
---
Yeah, thats kind of what im thinking.  I often fall into the 'trap' of leveling as fast as i can, but i really dont want to do that.  I have no hope of being a hardcore raider because of life, work, etc...so i really have no reason to be grinding hardcore.  Keeping the game fun for as long as possible is my priority.
---
Having something to distract me along the way should be fun.  Im actually thinking playing a priest (and hopefully doing more dungeons because of it) should help with that, too.  
---
That sounds really cool - You always see lots of Gnome mages and Warlocks, but warriors are much rarer. It must be so satisfying taking down monsters and players. At least I know it's infuriating to be on the other end - elves, humans and dwarves are one thing, but when you get mauled to death by a gnome it's on another level XD
---
I love when players do stuff like this! Looking forward to whatever you chose to play. 
---
100% gold upgrade. 87g can upgrade ANOTHER piece of gear more than this upgrades current bracers.
---
Cus there are a lot of girls on healing druids and they want to be NE's instead of cows.
---
Yes but you can't complete the Ony attunement quest in a raid.
---
JFC there are two of these threads every damn day now; how hard is it to use search?

---
I miss-spoke, you are correct. Anyways it's essentially what he said. That should be adequate.
---
Same but human pally, and less class fantasy, but my main from Vanilla through BFA has been the same 1 character, no reason to change now.
---
Honestly I never play like that. Still when there’s a new expansion I finish all of the quests in all the zones before I start end game content. That’s just me, but I think the speed runners probably won’t have a great time.
---
There are, but that won’t stop a gank squad. Herd mentality takes over and everything gets killed on site. Why risk not getting the honor?
---
I’m all for killing the other faction and world pvp but the honor grind is too competitive and it would just suck the fun out of world pvp.
---
It just causes a snowball effect of people leaving or switching factions as one side steamrolls the other.

Ion's quote at Blizzcon:
---
&gt; “So, this was a system added in Wrath of the Lich King where if you looted an item for a dungeon or raid boss, there’s a two hour window where you can give it to someone else, even though its BoP, who also participated in the boss kill.
---
&gt; This was added to solve a common problem that existed back in Classic where if you accidentally looted an item that someone else meant to get—or maybe you master looted to the wrong person—you could open a CS support ticket and say “I didn’t mean to loot this, I’d like to give it to so and so,” and it would take a four or five day turnaround time, but CS would generally help you out with that problem and transfer the item.
---
&gt; This is the case where we’re keeping loot trading in because the end result is the same. We’re saving you a four or five day wait, but we’re also freeing CS to focus on other player issues.”
---
There have to be some solution to overcrowding in the beginning of the game. And as I see it all solutions have drawbacks I personally think sharding is the lesser of two evils sins it doesn't affect gameplay nearly as much as dynamic respawn. And if I got to choose it will be in the game for all alliance/horde zones with the exception of cities and disabled in all neutral areas. 
---
When I first started playing it was only a couple of months before TBC dropped so I never got the chance to get the old pre-1.4 mounts. Now, we don't know if they will even be available for Classic, since they are starting from patch 1.12, but yeah, I hope they keep the old mounts until they pass the phase where 1.4 would have happened.
---
I think BfA and Legion were the first time i actually paid attention to quest text.  Maybe its just that im older now, maybe its that im more interested in the story in general, idk.  Theres just something that changed when i came back at the end of WoD that really changed how i view the game.  
---
I suppose the biggest thing was that i have less time now, and dont enjoy more 'serious' raiding/M+, so ive shifted more to 'smelling the roses' so to speak.
---
Yup. Takes about 15-20 minutes, and you're halfway through level 2 from exploration and a few quests along the way.
---
The counter argument of course is that it’s *less* nostalgic because it’s all new. But I think it’ll be plenty nostalgic. 
---
Can you link the results.
---
Don't forget the giant old god sword thing.
---
Haha, your ability to understand others emotions is identical to your ability to comprehend written language. 
---
Love these posts. I was right there with you, started the game a bit late and was doing MC and BWL up until TBC. I was in awe of the guys in T3 or High Warlord gear. 
---
Pretty funny that you appear to be Arms spec for all the raids. 
---
Found it. Ion's quote at Blizzcon:

&gt; “[Loot Trading] was added to solve a common problem that existed back in Classic where if you accidentally looted an item that someone else meant to get—or maybe you master looted to the wrong person—you could open a CS support ticket and say “I didn’t mean to loot this, I’d like to give it to so and so,” and it would take a four or five day turnaround time, but CS would generally help you out with that problem and transfer the item.

I always forget something! It's inevitable

It still costs money to hire the GMs to go thru the queue telling everyone 'no'. A 'we won't do that' policy won't save that much money.
---
No cross server bgs ever.
---
Achievements are fun and harmless. 
---
I just kind of remembered that I never stopped playing until mid bc. I was completely addicted until the expansion.  Most of what I don’t like about the game is fixed by just sticking with vanilla &gt;.&lt;
---
LvL 20 Tauren
---
Shit, you’re right, dropped in old SM though. Well, that is one thing I’d like for them to put in then.
---
When it comes to leveling, fury spec isn't a good idea because fury is extremely gear dependant. There's no point in all of your dps if you can't hit anything. Stick with the 2H arms spec. It's ideal for world pvp, dungeon dps up to a point, and you can tank just fine without going prot. Switch to fury when you get some solid lvl 60 gear, if that's the route you want to take.
---
Take you for granted? It's a fucking billion dollar company, not a friend of yours.
---
So Dungeon Finder, will they use that? No. The answer is no, clear and simple.
---
Will they use sharding as a permanent feature to kick in whenever needed like on retail RP servers? The answer is "they're aware sharding is antithetical to the vanilla experience".
---
Can you see the difference?
---
I use Luna Unit Frames.

At the top of my screen you are seeing me, my target, the target of my target, and the target of my targets target lol

Ill start off slow. Being able to shift click item names into the AH search bar.
---
&gt;Our goal is to clear all content within reasonable time, with a casual schedule but hardcore preparation.
---
Current content while its current = mediumcore. Should be a standard term.
---
Guild bank maybe. To stop account sharing, and other corruption 
---
First. rehire the classic class design dev and other important devs If you can't, give up immediately on this idea.
---
Nerf naxx gear by a lot, I'd say lower its ilvl to AQ40s. Add the unfinished vanilla content slowly to the game(hyjal, gim batol, etc). Not the cat versions, the actual Vanilla ones. Keep new gear the same ilvl as nerfed naxx, don't add flying, don't add talents, instead, add new specs to classes SLOWLY over time.
---
My skull is inlaid with eyes, why do you ask?
---
I understand he said that. I guess what I meant is that bc they've decided to implement a change from what was actually in vanilla, its opened the flood gates and everyone keeps saying "classic needs this QoL added too" for whatever idea they want. That's what's frustrating. 
---
You just have to remove points of "improved blizzard" talent and you unlcok the activision spell
---
Mage has more tricks. I think mage may be a better choice if you want to do pve, pvp, and raiding. If you are creative, mage can be a lot of fun in pvp. Warlock has nasty dots, though, which is deadly to some classes in pvp. Plus they will always have a place in a raid. If you go pet, easier to level than mage in the beginning. But then there's farming for shards...
---
I think you should figure out which class suits your playstyle better. 
---
but what about mushroom
---
Orc warrior.
---
I really like orcs, imo they are the coolest race in wow. Rad racials, striking look, especially orc female. 
---
While I kind of was convinced I just gonna roll a dps and keep it relaxed I simply cant, because I like group activitys and finding groups as a tank is very easy. So I will prolly start my 4th orc female warrior. 
---
eh....
---
I'd rather not deal with 'link achieve' for everything i try to find a group for.
---
Have you been to any other game subreddit? 
---
Up to you
---
hi mate, I'm trying to figure how to do it now. Let me know if u know how to ?
---
I was speaking about tuning, not limits. LBRS is tuned for a 5 man group, and UBRS was originally tuned for 15 people and was later lowered to 10.
---
We haven't heard a peep about beta as far as I know :(
---
I'm sort of expecting a real one though (meaning 2-4 months, not just a stress test type beta) especially after playing the demo and seeing how weird and unpolished things are. They may have a perfect working 1.12 reference, but it's obvious that rebuilding it on the new client is still pretty buggy.
---
I wish we'd get some real info about it either way though. If a beta is going to happen it probably will be starting soon, and if it's not going to happen I'd like to at least know so I can stop checking this subreddit obsessively for updates all day lol.

Private Server autism is not = to what you will see in Classic.
---
You are talking about people so mentally ill they get rank 14 every year and dedicates months to it and who speedrun instances to impress no one but a few hundred people. It's a group of like 500-1000 people that have no job, no life and no prospects who pick on a revolving door of mediocre players who try a private server out. **100 million people have played WoW. When this game was popular it had 15 million subs. These people are a drop in the bucket.** 
---
Also don't worry about the few that will be on every realm. You won't encounter them because they will be 30 levels ahead of you inside a week and they already have leveling groups/dungeon groups. They aren't even looking to interact with you and you will never see them on your side in BG's either because they will be running premades or spamming PVE all day/everyday. The only time you will run into them is when they are sitting in town trying to show off.
---
Don't stress it man. You will find a guild more your speed and have a blast.
---
I don't want to be a prick but this survey is set up poorly, you can only chose 1 crafting prof and its mandatory to take a collecting proff?

Aswell as the class icons not being consistent :p
---
Nope I don't play with anyone I know haha. But I always disliked ninja looting. Really ruined some runs in the past.
---
Throwback to another comment I made: basically he'll go swap weapons at certain hp loss values and when he does that he'll stun the entire party and run back to his chest to get weapons. You want your tank to tank him about in the middle of the bridge as that will cause you to be able to get out of the stun before he has time to run back with his new weapons 
---
Makes sense. Thanks for the reply!
---
you mean Wrath? Still cool though.
---
If you are pushing R14, every WSG group needs a flag carrier :D
---
hi mate, i see what u're saying.. it was made for me to figure out what people are playing. Nothing too fancy.. thanks for ur imput however :)
---
.....delicious...
---
Both classes are good in pvp, but mage and warlock both play differently. Mage has much more mobility but is super squishy, while lock is much tankier and has 0 mobility. Lock of course has much more of an emphasis on dots, but both are capable of bursting opponents. Locks are also more gear dependent then mages.
---
On the topic of rogues, both classes are capable of beating rogues in a 1v1, although locks will have a harder time until later gear tiers when they can actually survive rogue burst. Undead rogues will give you much more trouble then the standard rogue of course.
---
Mage vs lock is completely in favor of the lock. It's a very very hard matchup for the mage because of felhunter and the fact that mages can't easily burst through locks high up pool. It's totally possible for the mage to win by outplaying, but the matchup will always be lock favored.
---
Hope all this helps.
---
The first person gets a race car?

---
You’re just fast. Real fast.

If you played the original AV and you were horde you constantly died at the bridge. The archers for the alliance had one of the highest kill counts in all of Wow for its time. This is a fact given by blizzard. Therefore you were not owning any alliance ass once a minute. You were being funneled into archer fire destruction lock AOE, Druid aoe bombs, priest MC into the pit of death, and hunter Aoe. A good Druid could crush half a team at the bridge. Alliance has a default advantage especially in classic AV throughout most of the phases. So you were not kicking ass on AV in 90% of the servers as horde.
---
Raided all the way up to BWL and AQ20 with only 3 hotkeys on your entire bar. lol

&gt; [...] we recognize that launching WoW classic poses a couple of unique challenges. Unlike launching a traditional game that's brand-new where you can assume that everyone who is jumping in there on launch day has the intent to at least explore playing it long term, we expect that early on in classic there are going to be some people who are there die-hard dedicated racing to defeat Ragnaros and Onyxia, there will be others who just wanna check it out casually, they just want to see what all the fuss is about, they want to see what they missed, and our concern is  - I think exactly as you suggest - what's that gonna look like, what's that gonna do to the communities as sub-serverpopulations may dwindle over time. That is where we are looking at using sharding in a very limited way. We understand and I understand completely that sharding is anti-thetical to the concept of a cohesive classic community, we are competing over limited ressources. When Lord Kazzak is up and guilds are racing to defeat him, there needs to be only one Lord Kazzak. If you are trying to get, if you are trying to lock down the thorium veins that spawn in limited sections of the world, you should be competing over limited ressources. That said, the first few weeks when everybody is packed into Valley of Trials and everybody is packed into Elwynn, we think we can use sharding there in a limited, time-limited way to solve the initial launch day load problems while making sure that in the long run, as server communities solidify, there is a healthy population and a single world for everyone to live in.
---
So will they use sharding as a permanent feature that kicks in whenever needed just like on retail rp servers?
---
The answer is, probably not, maybe?
---
THAT is why people are worried.
---
Oh, I see. Fair enough. My mistake, then. Although I'd probably want to bring more than 5 for the bulk of lower since I remember the troll trash packs being pretty prone to wiping.
---
Ironically the link there is 404'd.  Tried it the other day :(
---
If you're looking to min/max - orc is better for pvp (hardiness) and troll is better for tanking (berserking for quick threat). Tauren Stam buff is pretty negligible if you think about it, that little bit of Stam will rarely save your life. War stomp is really what makes them worth playing. And be prepared to get targeted first in every pvp engagement because you're a big cow. But do what makes you happy.
---
Do you not see how sharding solves a problem that will only exist for a very limited amount of time, while dungeon finder only creates problems?
---
Ah nice, I call it Vanilla Retail, classic retail, way back when. Different strokes for different folks.
---
There  u go buddy, fixed the icons and the profession questions. Let me know if there's anything else u noticed?
---
Owerpowdered!
---
When my char is finally BiS or almost BiS geared and I can just wpvp, so in about 2 years time.
---
Since you want to clear all content, the reason guilds stack at least 8 warriors (besides the fact that it is a strong and versatile class) is the 4 horsemen fight in naxx requires that many. 
---
So let's say that Blizzard buffs the balance aspect of druids in some way. How do they do that without impacting the effectiveness of other specs and the overall balancing of the game?
---
Decrease the mana cost of balance spells by for example 10% to help fix their mana issues, congrats you've made resto druids better in PvP. Increase the base damage of spells and you get the same side effects. You've built a better resto druid in the process, and resto doesn't need the buffs.
---
How are they supposed to improve the PvE performance of balance druids when balance druids are already capable of globaling someone in PvP?  
---
Giving them talents that decrease mana cost of spells even further to make them last longer in PvE just leads to them having more mana leftover for healing and shapeshifting in PvP. How are they supposed to buff balance PvE performance without also drastically buffing them in PvP?
---
The +spir/sta food from the cooking skill, and enchants are all i can think of. 
---
Also try just asking for buffs before leaving your quest hub.
---
I know.  I was making a pun.
---
I've always enjoyed riding through Felwood. The big trees, green pools, everything shrouded in corruption. Has a cool feel to it imo.
---
20 to 21 points in Resto is all you need to heal as a Shaman, period. You only miss out on Restorative Totems (comes out to 6.25 MP5 - pretty terrible return for 5 points), Purification (only applies to the base healing on your spells, not the bonus healing on your gear), Mana Tide Totem (like the last 2 talents, this does not scale with gear - easy to make up for not having this by using extra consumables), and Healing Way (not a problem if you only cast Chain Heal). 
---
Full Resto is only necessary if you want to be the primary tank healer and/or make use of the 8-piece set bonus on your Tier 1 set. That said, a good raid leader is not going to assign a Shaman to be the primary tank healer because Chain Heal is so much more effective and efficient.
---
You can’t make profs all that apply? Also if you can’t choose a class flip a coin. You will know when the coin is in midair what you want it to land on. Pick that one.
---
hek yeah man. yeah finding a guild thats helpfull is a major plus, and i think there will be more friendly player playing classic than P-servers. like you said, be honest about being a "newbie" in the beginning of a dungeon and most of the time people will help out.

An accurate description of STV 
---
I did not have any problem starting on the server with my rl friends on launch day. I don't remember it being an issue.
---
depends on who opens
---
I am informing about FACTS. I have never said what my opinion are about sharding.
---
Everything has downsides and upsides. I don't have a clear answer for you but I can give you argument for some sort of cross-realm bg.
---
If the pvp server starts having faction imbalance the queues will get longer and longer. What do people do to farm honour if they can't bg? Get to Searing Gorge or Wintersping. Kill lvling 50-60 characters with garbage gear. Spawn kill flying points. Easiest honour in your life. 
---
Once again, I'm not saying yes or nay to cross realm pvp. I'm giving you real problems that will happen. Also, comparing pvp systems/problem solutions to pve ones is always a garbage argument.

I want to bask in the glory or new Arthas model in Warcraft 3 reforged.

This project is far from a sure thing financially, and requires substantial effort.  They are moving mountains to make this a thing, and those resources could probably make them more money elsewhere.
---
Blizzard is not just Bobby Kotick or whoever your big scapegoat boogeyman is today.  The underpaid dude who is messing with the lighting in Winterspring right now to make Classic look right is Blizzard too.  He could have a unionized job that doesn't take advantage of his passion to make him work harder for less pay, but no, he's double-checking textures because he wants Classic WoW to be a thing just like I do.  Don't dehumanize 95% of the company because you're mad at the top 5% of it.

Yes, and the facts are the two are VERY different things.

TUF was added in Naxx patch, over 18 months into vanilla. If your plan is to hit 60 and then get TUF I hope you level really slowly  - I'd expect it won't be available for at least 6 months in Classic.
---
I played Alliance only and my gf played Horde only.  Our first chars will be Alliance so she can experience all this stuff, but I plan to roll a horde at some point too.
---
As expected trolls would take the survey too  :)
---
trolls are quite the viable race for their pve racials 
---
True, but I remember frequently using my trinket on cheapshot. Also, if a rogue is using crippling poison, I'll run away and intercept. I mean Rogue vs Warrior the winner is almost always the one who gets the first hit, but on evasion I'd usually go with a hit and run strategy like I suggested. 
---
Can’t see it

looking forward to southshore being a thing again :)

True story
---
Orc rogue on a pvp server. Orc for the stun resist, rogue so I can pick when to fight, and pvp server because I'm only here for the pvp.
---
Well maybe just keep the "key" powerful talents where they are (ie not at the bottom of the tree) and expand the trees verticaly, but with even more nuances specialization talents down the tree, so that it's not a "must", but you only take them if you really want to be the best of the best pure \*spec\*.
---
good 1
---
after u take the survey u should have an option to see the results?
---
The honor won't be quite as easy because in vanilla you had the "Honorless Target" buff for 30 seconds after landing at a flightpoint. But it will lead to a ton of ganking people questing. 
---
Even without faction imbalance. A strong premade will stop bg's entirely if the pool of players interested in pvp is not large enough to get more honor from queueing than ganking for the opposing faction.
---
Speak for yourself, brown-noser.
---
Killing taurens felt amazing.  
---
People think they know how big taurens are by comparison, but you never really get it until you're dueling one.  
---
I hear you on the private server kid talk.  My example is running MC and BWL as a fire mage.  I did it in real vanilla and topped the meters on every fight except immune bosses in a mediocre guild.  Yet you mention the viability of not going frost to the private server crowd and they act like it's so bad an option to be not worth discussing.
---
I get that frost is better using private server numbers.  We don't know what the difference is for real vanilla and whether it's worth the 2xweekly respec if you're doing other raids.  The PS kids are similarly closed minded and arrogant about entire classes.
---
Well you can go fall off a bridge or something

IMO OP's post and this comment are stange.  I'm assuming they are just done to get reddit karma?
---
There was a similar post on this sub's front page a couple of days ago where someone said they basically didn't care in what state the game was released in, they were "thankful" and would enjoy it/accept it regardless.  The irony here being this type of consumer mindset is what allows gaming studios to adopt policies such as the retail WoW cash shop, the same policies which lead many to push for a return to classic WoW in the first place....
---
Got it thanks.
---
Nice data! Didn't have idea! Thanks... And arcanite reaper? DM?
---
I mean timeline wise
---
np bro
---
Yes, facts and opinions are different things. We are discussing facts here. You are the one who starting to talk about opinions...
---
&gt; No one wants to play on an empty server
---
Exactly. And nobody anywhere should be punished because they chose wrong.
---
I hated my PVE server because of the low pop, you could never group.
---
Yes, they are like a hivemind and all share the same "groupthink" opinions. I am going to specifically hunt down every lowbie warrior I find in Classic because all the private server kids are going to go warrior because of how OP they are on Private servers. 
---
Hitting level 40!
---
Xenif, the first 60, hit level cap on December 3rd or 4th on Stormreaver from what I could gather online.  
---
Keep in mind, the actual *downtime* was actually rather low, at least for EU, the problem was frequent disconnects and server queues, so that person could've been on a server with little to no queue and therefore been able to play more or less uninterrupted.
---
Then give me an example of another thing that's similar to sharding and we can talk.
---
Mushroom beats everybody because of fear duh
---
Sounds about right. That's like 50% slower than you'd expect so I'm sure the server instability slowed them down a bit but there were still plenty of people that no life'd computer games back then and had already levelled to 60 on the beta so they had a very good idea of what to do.
---
So, did you just assume no one wanted to be a druid?
---
Where does this conspiracy shit about reddit karma come from?  I have never met a single person in my life who has ever cared about reddit karma, a completely useless non-currency, yet I see constant accusations about people whoring for it.
---
You have 2 dads? That's kinda gay.
---
I'm not keen on sharding, but I understand why some people want it. I would begrudgingly be fine with starting zones and beginning quests. That means once you're sent to the big city for the first time, you're done.
---
Still salty about diminishing returns on fear and seduce. 
---
11 days. 
---
It takes people around 4 to hit 60 now.
---
so I'm going alliance so shaman was out.. paladin is also boring to me so that was out.. from the rest I actually template out a character from each class with race / professions that I'd like them as.. and started prioritizing what I'd like the play.. how they play.. and what I do and don't like about them.
---
hunter I like but I don't really want to lose the bag space / manage pet training while leveling right away so that is a future alt maybe.
---
druid I really like but I don't really want to resto.. I kinda want to bear tank with it. mainly because no res but I know they're not great tanks.. so maybe a PVP alt or an alchemy / herb farming alt.
---
warlock is my love I mained a gnome warlock from initial vanilla release through mop when I swapped to healing.  so Def remaking my gnome but not sure if I want to main him again.
---
mage is fun too but if I want a dps casting alt I'd rather do my warlock.
---
rogue looks fun. bed pp runs for gold (esp if no dire maul at phase 1). just lock picking for tips in iron forge.  faster paced melee seems fun too so a good choice.
---
warrior.. slow to level but I have this dream of a female gnome with pink hair tanking Onyxia and rags and all that. and with a very strong dps side too! plus fun with engineering as a gnome makes sense too! kinda want this one..
---
priest.. this is what I'm maining now on live.. I actually almost went priest for vanilla back in the day not really know much about mmos so I decided on warlock. so I might try a priest. plus I really want benediction and hate myself all the time I didn't get it on live when I could have easily back in wrath.. plus when dire maul comes out good sold gold farm and plenty of groups to get into. and as a dwarf with fear ward I'd help in PVP too.
---
so I settled on dwarf priest for now but human rogue / gnome warrior / warlock are right there and who knows maybe last minute I'll change my mind. 
---
Don't encourage this sick fuck you replied to. He supports the murder of innocents. He cheered the terrorist in New Zealand on today. He needs to die 
---
Ok let me try this on you.
---
I will ask you a question. If you can answer yes or no you win.
---
Will Blizzard only use sharding at launch and in the starting zones?
---
Yes or no.
---
The point here is that you can't answer yes or no.
---
Get it now?
---
My first 60 in vanilla was a rogue i leveled with my brother's priest. He took enchant/tailor while i took herb/alch.
---
Having the professions to keep up and little bonuses to give each other was a good part of the vanilla experience to me.
---
i'm in no way good at vanilla pvp, but i have played wow from vanilla to bfa and if I saw a war insta trinket my cheap shot i'd blind him and get a full reset without having commited any cooldowns aside from blind.
---
That still happened even through wrath lol.
---
Wait wtf... How do you know?
---
It did.  
---
They definitely existed
---
That is for a number of reasons, mainly because even now there are a number of quests with TBC reward values even now on vanilla realms.  You simply CANNOT make lvl 60 in 4 days played unless you do so with LOADS of rested exp.  I have levelled hundreds of characters to 60, and I think even I would struggle to get under 5 days on any class but maybe hunter or mage.
---
I want loot trading.
---
Especially if that warrior alright has whirlwind axe!
---
I remember seeing two lettered names when I played back in Vanilla
---
food's definitely on the list for more HP, better regen, etc, but no OOMPH.
---
I'd ask for kings, but 5 min, it's gone by the time I get to grinding spot. Def gonna hit up druids for Mark for another sweet, sweet 1DPS. 
---
If they don't bring over Halo Reach's armor, commendation, and challenge system then I won't play it.  
---
The way I’ve understood it is for DPS ONLY:
---
Phase 1: MC
---
Tier 1: Rogues, Warriors
---
Tier 2: mage, Hunter
---
Tier 3: lock
---
Tier 4: paladin, priest, Druid(non consumes), shaman
---
And as you hit the later phases the itemization for casters is great so locks and mages are the top dog mostly in AQ40/Naxx.
---
Shams in wc3 use 2 fist weps... so...
---
Prismaticstar....I...I love you.  You took the words out of my mouth.  \*sheds a single tear of joy\*
---
Private server 1st 60s did it in under 5 days played. One server 1st was a feral, but typically you hear a hunter or mage.
---
Mats are:
---
* 20 Enchanted Thorium Bar  
---
* 8 Huge Emerald  
---
* 8 Large Opal  
---
* 6 Essence of Earth  
---
* 4 Enchanted Leather
---
Unless that proc rate is god damn amazing I'm not sure that thing is worth it.
---
Druid
---
thanks for that, i deleted it by mistake when changing the class icons over. fixed nw
---
Let's set some things straight, a public billion dollar company does not bend over backwards for their costumers. They would never have proceeded with this project if there was obvious signs that it wouldn't break even. 
---
&gt;Blizzard is not just Bobby Kotick or whoever your big scapegoat boogeyman is today. The underpaid dude who is messing with the lighting in Winterspring right now to make Classic look right is Blizzard too. He could have a unionized job that doesn't take advantage of his passion to make him work harder for less pay, but no, he's double-checking textures because he wants Classic WoW to be a thing just like I do
---
**Nah.** The Classic team is small, with some big timers from Blizzard working on it, so I very much doubt that your speculations here are correct. 
---
I'm not mad at Blizzard, I'm mad at their costumers (*fans*) that feel the need to treat the company like a friend. Take a look at what Blizzard was between 2004-2008 as a company and what is has become. It has all been allowed to happen because fans always praise Blizzard employees and treat them like rockstars/friends. Stop thinking Blizzard is different than any other company, they aren't. They are in it to make money for share-holders, that comes first at this point. 
---
*Of course that doesn't mean that every employee at Blizzard should be held accountable - the company as a whole should. (The management mostly)*
---
Yes, I get it, but you're wrong, unless you mean "we don't know" in the sense that blizzard can change their mind or have made plans they aren't telling us.
---
Ian literally said sharding if applied would be at launch only.
---
Also druid.  
---
I'VE JUST BEEN IN THIS PLACE BEFORE
---
When you compare the Paladin specs for "midgame" what are you looking at, exactly?
---
Vanilla. Your not paying for Classic so there is no retail behind it. Retail is present day.
---
Feel free to remove gnomes from a choice though 
---
I'm waiting too ruin my life farming uldaman and sfk for twink gear drops again. Maybe throw in some bfd runs for that lvl 19 cloth gear 
---
I agree it shouldn't be split. But equally powerful items should come from pvp and raiding, but they need to have the same level of exclusivity and effort requirement. Unfortunately, 16 hours of grinding a day for weeks on end is vastly more effort than even the most hardcore of raiding teams schedules.
---
&gt; Ian literally said sharding if applied would be at launch only.
---
And again, no, he never said that.
---
Prove me wrong and show me anytime Ion or anyone at Blizzard ever use the word "only" when talking about Sharding.
---

There you go.
---
What?
---
Real talk tho, as a future pally tank, if you open with frost nova + shatter crit cone of cold after only 1 tick of consecrate,  I will punch you in the dick. Just do 1 blizzard before you start spamming your instants please and thanks.

---
You know, you can disagree with people; even vehemently if you wanted to; without calling them names.  All you do when you resort to instant-reply insults is effectively say "I don't like your opinion, so I'm going to insult you instead of coming up with a compelling counter argument."  Which...honestly hurts you more than it helps you.  Low-hanging fruit and all that...ya know?
---
Arcanite Reaper was the original good weapon, it was pretty expensive and hard to get. It was pretty broken before the normalisation patch (1.8 - 12 months into vanilla). After normalisation it was still decent but there were other weapons easier to get at 60 that were comparable.  
---
     
---
The ultimate 'catch up' patch for warriors/rets/enhance were the AV rewards that came out with Naxx (1.11  - 20 months into vanilla) that had the Ice Barbed Spear and The Unstoppable Force. IBS you could by winning a single AV match at lvl 51 that was basically the best weapon you could get outside of raiding at 60. Arcanite reaper would still be an upgrade but a very small one, and become basically completely pointless for the amount of effort it took. TUF you could get from exalted with AV that really just took a few AV weekends of solo/afk grinding and gave you a BWL quality weapon. So yeah one patch basically invalidated every drop from lvl 51 through to 2 tiers of raiding.  But by that stage of the game all the raiders were decked out in BWL/ZG/AQ gear so this idea of grinding 5mans or arcanite bars for weak gear at 60 wasn't popular.

Don't worry you'll have new ones soon 😁
---
They are not " bending over backwards to provide me a product/service that I have been requesting for over a decade ".  They are undertaking the project because of the exact opposite of what you state in your second paragraph, they believe the project will be financially viable.
---
Also, the only reason they are in this position of re releasing classic in the first place is because the community as a whole didn't like how WoW was bastardized so that the company could make more money.  THEY should be thankful that the community lead them to a new, likely lucrative project.
---
As for the underpaid employee, yeah, sure, I'm happy he/she has a job they are passionate about.  But if your complaint here is the level of wages of game developers you are in the wrong sub.
---
secnario 1, with no loot trading, only the rogue rolls in situation 1 (because hunters can't use maces in vanilla correct?) so = 100% at item
---
secnario 2, with what I believe you laid out means 4 people rolling (I'm assuming the hunter is rolling too, if the mage intends to give to him) = 50% rogue gets it
---
My history is with warriors but I usually go with the strength potions, weight/sharpening stones, rage potions, health potions, cheaper weapon enchants on weapons I plan too use for a while. Like WW axe etc. I find minor run speed too a good set of boots helps alot. I only use this method if said warrior is an alt though.
---
Karma whoring does exist.  I don't know if the people who frequent this sub necessarily are in that category, but it does exist: especially in other subs.  Ever see a low-effort post, meme copy paste, or obvious troll-bait post?  Those are generally considered karma whoring because they are just looking for echo chamber responses and upvotes.
---
For what it's worth I agree with you, but at the same time I do think that this post is on the cusp of what could be considered karma whoring. 
---
goodbye 2020s, hello remastered 2000s games.
---
Maybe use the group chat to let the others know which server to pick once the game is live.
---
Not all private servers have the TBC quest experience. 4 days played will be possible without rested experience. Only a few will be able to achieve it, but certainly doable. 
---
Huh?
---
"Go away! You'll ruin everything!" - J'skar [https://imgur.com/a/T3OOYDt](https://imgur.com/a/T3OOYDt)
---
Not saying it doesn’t work mate. Just saying it’s to minor to give a fuck. Just my personal opinion ofc. I really like the new water effects so I’m glad they added them but I can understand your point of view as well of course. 
---
Mages are really strong without needing that much gear. You can do well in dungeons and world pvp with just blues. 
---
Thanks! Run speed enchant is moot cause pally 8% run/mount speed. But otherwise confirms what I've got thus far.
---
You are absolutely right, i just hope i am not stuck having no fun doing that all day then. :D
---
I didn't buy bfa and quit 2 weeks after legion dropped but recently finished my new PC and wanted to play with binds etc on my new keyboard and mouse so I used gold to buy a month of time. I regret it
---
Retail differentiates between Blizzard’s public consumable offering and private servers, which you cannot “buy at a retail.” 
---
Vanilla refers to the original game, pre-tbc.
---
When you talk “Vanilla” WoW, you’re talking about the original *version* of the game. Vanilla Retail ...or when people say “Back when I played vanilla in retail” is that state of the game when you could buy it at retail.
---
Or moonshine distilled from sabrecat pelts?
---
Accepting a Battleres or Soulstone the second after the stun hits probably lets you avoid it yeah
---
Yeah I'm leveling my first pally when classic drops, I've mained warrior and leveled several alts/twinks over the years and xpacs. I knew pally had the talents but some guides recomend not taking them. I'll be taking them myself
---
Darkshore&gt;Westfall
---
because lots of the quests have TBC exp rewards values.  you cannot take private realms as an example, and I say this having been a private server player and tester for close to a decade, and I was responsible for many hundreds if not thousands of corrections, and there are just as many still not fixed.
---
Southshore vs Tarren mill apocalypse 😎
---
Druids can tank there as well.
---
I remember running premades after the cross server battlegroups came out. It wasn't quite as bad as you're describing, but I agree it set wow down a bad path. You forgot pugs pretty quickly, and started recognizing people from your own server less. But we still knew every premade team we went against and led to some cross server rivalry. Organized world PvP slowed since we didn't have to grind out honor in queue. 
---
Worse than the community aspect is the effect it will have on high level ranking. The real world time investment is the same to get there, but less queue time means non stop back to back matches with no break at all, and any break you do take will be heavily punished because you'll miss 10 matches instead of 1. Not good for anyone's health. Top honor brackets will get skewed wildly higher and that will probably impact causal rankers too. 
---
So, I'd rather not have it since as much as long queues can be annoying, there are other things you can do whether it's world PvP, farming, or just having a bathroom break. 
---
IDK man that sounds pretty good to me
---
Due respect, but I don't believe this is accurate.

---
TUF should be available whenever AV is released.
---
Most likely, there was an option in the demo. I see no reason to not have it.
---
The majority of the players on launch will be casual players or tourists who are new to the game, or haven't played it in a decade. Don't worry about it. 
---
That's rouges
---
This is your claim:
---
&gt; Ian literally said sharding if applied would be at launch only. 
---
This is what I hear him say: "When everyone is packed into X-zone we THINK we can use sharding there in a time limited way to solve the initial launch day load problems".
---
You do understand that this in no way exclude sharding in other areas and times?
---
The word THINK and ONLY doesn't mean the same thing. This guy is a cleaver lawyer you know. He knows what he is saying and why. He is leaving the door open for sharding in the future. And THAT'S the point I'm making.
---
Game developers don't provide a service to society anyway. In an ideal world they wouldn't be paid.
---
I'm pretty sure the world record on a pserver that is as legit as they can possibly make it is 5 days and 12 hours or something like that, done by a troll hunter. Making it an ENTIRE day under that would require some kind of magic.
---
But yeah, 11 days seems very legit. Pretty damn impressive though considering when it was done.
---
For dungeons/raids healers are the least gear dependant, particularly paly/shaman that bring great group buffs even before the healing.  
---
For PvP I'd say hunters and mages stand out as being powerful even with poor gear at 60 for dps. If you want to have the biggest impact in random BGs your best bet is probably being a healer again though. Just stay way back and through heals/dispels and you can have a huge impact. Often random bgs just come down to which team has more healers.
---
Didn't they literally say in the earnings call that they didn't consider classic to be a major release? It would appear that the higher ups are treating it as a side project, not some cash cow. This is especially clear in the fact that there aren't going to be MTX, or even a separate subscription for it.
---
They might think it will break even, but they certainly aren't doing it to be lucrative.
---
Hunter. It literally won't matter what you're wearing or if you're wearing anything if you go BM. 
---
How you gonna just not make Thor a Shaman like that?
---
Yes, I remember one guy on Al'Akir, a warlock. Just named Ra after the egyptian god.
---
A mount is a far bigger upgrade than 2 AP and 6 stam.
---
https://youtube.com/watch?v=rqj1K75tETU
---
Do you understand what time-limited means?
---
Feraldruid as tank. Because idiots keep perpetuation the myth that they cant tank and I want to show it in their face that they are wrong.
---
I said a year or two ago that I anticipated April 2nd 2019 release date. They always used to troll us on April Fools Day, so I foresee them pretending to release it on April 1st, then actually releasing it the next day.
---
Actually no. "Retail" when used in a business sense for example by Blizzard themselves refers to present day sales or profits. Classic isn't introducing a new revenue stream from an investor mindset. Instead it will be included with BfA &amp; BfA sub. Thats not to say Blizz won't see some gains in BfA sales and BfA sub/resub numbers. 
---
No way warrior is easiest. Druid by far. Only healer in the 5 man. 2 Druids in a raid.  If your tank or dps already have a piece you tale it for offset so you basically build all three sets of gear pretty easy.  
---
Good tanks want a threat set, Defensive Set and fire resist set at a minimum. Also, AoE threat set, Stat gear, etc.
---
You need to farm a Lionheart Helm, a Force Reactive Disk, Quel Serrar and possibly Dark Iron Set.  There us tons of other expensive stuff you should get too.  You get easy tier in raids but you need tons of gold for gear and consumes. Also have fun farming gold in prot. 
---
This one took me back. Thanks for the share!
---
Thanks, I was wrong. Memory is not to be trusted. Looks like it was introduced 8 months after launch with the BGs.
---
I've played more vanilla than retail since Cata tbh, but Darkshore and Ashenvale. They were such wonderful tranquil zones and they ruined them completely.
---
Do you understand what "think" means?
---
Works for me
---
Yes, and do you understand what they think? They think they can use sharding to solve the initial launch day load problems.
---
Rowge*
---
Your points are all fair, and there probably is too much company hero-worship in the industry at large, including with Blizzard.  I have however felt that this sub in particular has been a whirlpool of negativity and selfishness for a long time.  While you shouldn't treat a company as your best friend and buy into their marketing hype etc, I feel like this sub frequently forgets that Blizzard (or any other company) is a collection of humans, and for the most part, those humans are super passionate about what they do and put a lot of themselves into their work.
---
Lately there has been a LOT of ragging on Blizzard as a whole, and while it is justified and ultimately just the free market at work, sometimes I do think it's important to voice some appreciation for people who work hard to make things that I enjoy since it seems like they often get caught in the crossfire.
---
Either way your viewpoint is valid and I realize that I have been too aggro in this thread, so apologies.
---
Crit overpower or crit Ms with white Auto and procs... I'll take the overpower crit all day.
---
where can you learn riding skills for that?
---
That's classic :p
---
&gt;They think they can use sharding to solve the initial launch day load problems. 
---
Yes, this is what they think.
---
The question is if that **exclude** sharding in the future? THAT'S what we are discussing.
---
&gt; but some guides recomend not taking them.
---
Anything that recommends NOT getting Pursuit of Justice is pretty garbage, IMO.
---
You could put 4 points into a blessing you shouldn't be using, or faster judgments that'll oom and slow you down for shit damage, or improve a seal that you don't use, or a 10% chance to reduce damage by 10% or other equally useless things. Or you can run and ride 8% faster all the time.
---
If you're not first you're last. Shake and bake.
---
In the 15 years I've been playing WoW I have never heard anyone refer to Vanilla as "Retail" Vanilla. That's just dumb. Vanilla describes the original game. There is no need to add additional words to help describe it any further.
---
More importantly it is studied because of how people (the players) reacted to the epidemic. Players tried to create quarantine zones and restrict access to high pop areas and other efforts to stem and contain the outbreak. 
---
Ever play on a private server?
---
Even if they don't believe classic itself will be successful (I highly doubt this) the company expects its release will increase the bottom line in some form or fashion. Perhaps they believe classic will lead to more people trying retail which leads to more mount purchases. Just an example.
---
I know it's romantic to think that they are willing to re create classic out of their passion for the game, regardless if it hurts the company financially, but this is just a bit naive.
---
On Nost I had a pair of these on a twink 39 rogue that was "of power" They were +20 Attack Power plus the 8 attack power innate. 28 total AP on some level 38 leather bracers lol.
---
Except if the item would be really good for the Rogue/Druid/Shaman. Best roll that need 💯.
---
Again, this depends on whether or not you trust blizzard.
---
Does the line exclude any plans sharding after initial launch? Absolutely
---
Does this mean blizzard wont do it? Of course not, but it's the best we have to go on.
---
But you need to ask yourself, what motivation would blizzard have for sharding in the long term? It makes the game worse and doesn't grant any benefits.
---
If you’re talking about business symantecs thats wrong man. Retail products are those that are widely available to the public for consumption. As opposed to say...an enterprise software product, which you would need to go through months of consulting just to understand the price. 
---
It has nothing to do with the time period. 
---
I don't mean to be a wet blanket, but that there is Gubber Blump, not Greg.
---
You are absolutely right. I corrected my original post.
---
Balance druid. *So good*.
---
Nah this was vannila
---
I've quested there once. It was nice! :D
---
-Horde Player
---
nice.
---
Hmmm not really the case. Mages definitely don’t have high speed leveling because of higher than intended quest XP. It’s dependent on respawn times for AoE grinding. 
---
Similarly hunter comes down to how efficiently you grind and minimizing time not killing things. 
---
Combat Rogue.
---
It was done in Vanilla in 4d 20h without using autoloot. 
---
Wow.  Just looked at my server and that seeing those names really brought back a lot of nostalgia.  
---
You are missing the point. They don't work that way because of the players. For you though, it can work like that and enjoy world bosses without the pressure of getting there on time and the politics of tagging it.
---
I think a huge reason sharding is their best solution is that server populations are going to take some time to stabilize. They know there will be tourists and people who never even make it past level 10. Sharding can allow space for everyone without having to have mega 10k pop servers or so many servers that they have to merge them later.
---
Huge backlash means one post with tens of thousands of upvotes and thousands of comments.
---
Hurdreds, enen *thousands* of posts that get lost in “new” mean nothing.
---
Basically: united we stand, divided we get loot trading. You might not like that, but that is the reality of protesting.
---
Because your argument breaks down when you realize that there isnt always intent to ninja behind loot.
---
If someone rolls need on something and wins but it was a side grade. Why not let him trade it away.
---
If someone sincerely accidentally presses the need button but doesnt need the item - again why not let them trade it away.
---
If your only argument is that it's the same whichever way they do it then it's clear what system had more advantages.
---
It did. For some reason it was common for Tauren Droods to have only 2 letter names on my server. I don't know why but thats how it was.
---
I just asked myself: What is my WoW fantasy? Who i want to be in Azeroth? The made it so much easier: Troll Hunter and Tauren Shaman. I think both are my favorite WoW races behind Blood Elves (I started to play in TBC as a Belf Hunter). For picking the classes it was a bit harder, but this AMAZING video helped me out: https://youtu.be/3t-OsvFBiXE
---
Did you find it on DaoC reddit ? https://www.reddit.com/r/daoc/comments/b1eh6m/one_day_one_meme_24/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
&gt; Does the line exclude any plans sharding after initial launch? Absolutely 
---
 NO it doesn't. YOU claimed they sauid "at alunch only" when in fact they never said that. If they said At launch only that would indeed exclude any plans of sharding. When Ion said "we think we can use sharding" it does NOT exculde anything. Heis just talking and not making any claims what so ever/
---
&gt;But you need to ask yourself, what motivation would blizzard have for sharding in the long term? 
---
Money. They save A LOT when they run servers on a cloud system. That's why retail can't handle massive world pvp and the server laggs out when 40v40 fight each other in AV...
---
Me: Finally leaving the mines alive after completing the last Battle of Hillsbrad chain quest and have full bags ready to vendor and plenty of completed quests to turned in...
---
Tarren Mill is Under Attack!
---
Guess I'll die. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Joana is confident that just under 4 days played is doable. Since he holds the world record I am inclined to trust his judgement.
---
Nothing like getting a full group of level 30s together to kill a level 60 at nesingwary 
---
mages save time through portal travel, that saves more time than anything else whether its aoe farming or questing route.
---
Pi=best name ever. I make people call me three point one four in chat.
---
&gt; He is just talking and not making any claims what so ever.
---
Okay, what reason do you have to believe there will be sharding outside of the launch period?
---
&gt; Money. They save A LOT when they run servers on a cloud system.
---
Not when they're destroying their own game at the same time and they're aware of it.
---
Agreed. We complain far too much as a community. Let’s be positive and remind them that we appreciate them for the things they do!
---
Rogue...roguecraft video being skill whereas most rogue would need to be geared.
---
So less druids in raid just makes getting gear easier alliance side. But ita not like stacking shamans is any less common than stacking pallys. I think druid is equally good om horde/alli side
---
I really am looking forward to running scholomance again, such a cool dungeon.
---
When you buy if from the store
---
And I look forward to being proved wrong.  There is a HUGE difference between a private realm starting a character than starting on classic with all the other players.  I am sure classic experience will be very different and slower.  We will find out in good time, and honestly I think anyone trying to rush to this extent is literally missing the point of playing an MMORPG.
---
Maybe his server was fine? 11 days is a long time. To be fair, it was pretty fast for what they knew back then though.
---
auto loot was available in vanilla, and did the maps suddenly change to make levelling routes more efficient?
---
Let OP have his discussion. New people may chime in with new perspectives. 
---
I understand what you're trying to say... but what else is there to discuss, really? Sharding? Loot trading?
---
Yes, and or, get over the mistake and move on.
---
Pretty sure stormreaver is close..but not 100%. I know for certain I was 4th on stormreaver on horde side but dont see my name.
---
I mean yea... mage, druid and hunter can move faster. 
---
My point was that TBC xp rates isn’t massively affecting p server first to 60 rates. 
---
I don't care. As long as they release the game I'm happy. 
---
&gt;Okay, what reason do you have to believe there will be sharding outside of the launch period?
---
The FACT that Blizzard have never used the word ONLY.
---
&gt; Not when they're destroying their own game at the same time and they're aware of it. 
---
Ehhhhhh, dude, have you seen retail lately?
---
So i have to have a google account ? No, thanks.
---
Joana did 4 days 20 hours an vanilla servers, not private servers. 
---
I'd love it if that happened. We were together in classic, BC, Wrath. Both quit after Wrath, and only I came back later. I keep asking if I'll get a partner for vanilla. The response is generally intrigued but noncommittal. 
---
Yes I know, I have been around this vanilla scene since beta, I have even been on realms with joana.  
---
If a rogue let's you run away and intercept he's playing very very badly.   Crippling poison should all but guarantee unless you lag that you can stay in the dead zone between melee and charge/intercept. You have a 70% slow vs a 50% slow. The difference is massive. 
---
Heck if you trinket on any self respecting rogue's cheapshot their immediate response will be to blind you. Then they get to open on you again. 
---
Holy Midgame - always good, only gets better with gear.
---
Prot Midgame - It's the end of the road for prot paladins. You can do the 5 man dungeons, but at this point the warrior and druid have pulled ahead.
---
Ret Midgame - Even as you gear, the DPS gap continues to get very wide. 
---
Puny alliance wont get the horde. 
---
It was available, but the runner (Joana) didn't know about/didn't use shift looting.
---
Various optimizations like doing certain quests together, or in a different order, or skipping/not skipping certain quests. Using death warps to travel faster. Doesn't seem like much but it all adds up over the course of a 1-60 run. 
---
Am I the only one that doesn't care about this? Like... Get with your friends when the game comes out &amp; pick a server. It's not the most pressing issue. I personally don't care about loot trading but so many people do, so I believe this should be priority #1.
---
Lol. People keep saying this. Unless you stealth/dash to confuse the fuck out of a Warrior, there’s good odds he can demo shout your stealth off. 
---
The Stormwind park has that I believe. There is a druid trainer there.
---
Yup, one of the best 👍🏻
---
Not going to add up to a 15-20% time saving
---
Many of us already paid for their product when we purchased WoW in 2004 but then after a few years they took the game, that we purchased, away and forced the servers into BC. While BC was my favorite expansion it doesn't change the fact that we could never go back to vanilla or try to progress thru Naxx. 
---
So I don't really see it as bending over backwards to provide something we already paid for.
---
What does that have to do with intercepting? 
---
I cast Rank 1 Frostbolt at him until he dies.
---
I remember watching my buddies lol 40 ish warrior almost kill a 60 enh shammy using overpower because it cant miss. It was amazing.
---
He's already saved 17% over his 2006 run with the mistakes. 
---
evidence?
---
Your going to get two types of responses, the first is from people who don't understand priest 100% and they will say +Heal and Spirit. The second is from the priest who have been playing it for 15 years of vanilla, they will say mp'5 and int (there is some caveats)
---
Spirit and by way of in combat regen is useless till you get 3 piece T2 Tranny. Until that point you are 100% better off with a more mixed approach that focuses more on Mp5 and Int, its nets you a a larger return. Also you will find most high end priest players will 90% be PI/Holy, it just serves better utility over all and then 10% mana is hot shit when your in Int and Mp'5 gear. the only purely plus healing gear i go for is a green wand, and Robes of the exalted. The rest is a mix, but i will rock more mp5 and int over shit stats and a little plus healing. 
---
Do what you want, but i think you will have a higher chance of consistent success over all in int and mp5 gear, spirit is garbage till T2 3 piece though, math doesn't lie.  
---
Got it. Yep, agreed.
---
Alot of people seem to assume all their friends are going to be on launch day and there wont be any issues communicating what server to pick.
---
It's pretty easy for your friend to log on a few days later and no life a character all day and decide he doesnt want to reroll.    It happened to a bunch of my friends back in the day. 
---
I hope y'all get to play with your friends 
---
Check his discord
---
Resomething....
---
If you as a Warrior/Paladin get Smites Mighty Hammer on your first run, you know you are going to kick ass in redridge
---
&gt; Where does this conspiracy shit about reddit karma come from?
---
I don't know. People speak of the shit as if its some currency with actual value. Im going to guess its younger people that grew up with social media. But most old classic wow players are 30+ probably and couldnt give a fuck less about a karma or a thumbs up. 
---
I wish they would shut up about the shit honestly.
---
me (rogue) and my friend (feral dru) took about 30min killing a lvl ?? warrior in shimmering flats when we were like 32 and 34, it was very rewarding
---
I will wait and check his stream/vids in classic
---
I am just so sick of people claiming it takes 4-5 days to 60 when for 99.9% of people it will be 6+ days even if they are playing hardcore
---
Agreed. I got runescape on my phone too. Gg
---
hah! I see what you did there!
---
ugh... Gamerbro says forced politics 1 minute and 33 seconds into his video. I think Im gonna go throw up.
---
I saw a meme with the format (possibly on /r/dankmemes), so I googled the format and found: https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1471145-parry-this-you-filthy-casual which is what I used for the template
---
This is the best one yet. Show them how wrong they are!
---
(also you might just have made me decide on druid. Love hunters, but the world always needs more druids).
---
I think I agree with this from my own experience. Larger manapool helps alot, especially when I need to cast all the time. I rarely get to have 5 sec rule relevant during a fight. And going 30 healing on each piece instead of 25 intellect seems not so worth. But a mix rather, letting me spam a little lower ranks of heals but with a much larger mana pool. 
---
Rogues are good as long as they have good weapons. We depend waaaay too much on our weapons.
---
bump
---
That's a really good question, never thought about it myself until now.
---
Madseason is amazing. Sometimes I have his videos on repeat because his voice is so soothing. 
---
Who said anything about being a good tank when you are the top melee dps on a warrior? This isn't 1.1 WoW. This is 1.12 where warriors crush from start to finish.
---
Yeah MT is hard mode. They are usually PVE'rs who only play on PVP Servers because the players are usually better. In real vanilla they were taurens. This time they will be trolls for further min maxing/threat. I am glad they are there. I have no wish to MT or be a troll warrior.
---
I'm worried that the priest would be too squishy.  An actual concern?
---
This was a door we used to use to port out to repair from consecutive runs of LBRS for keys.  Was this fixed in 1.12 or earlier?  It has been so long.
---
Rogue with a brain: Gouges you since you swapped to Battle Stance.
---
If you think gearing a DPS warrior while you tank instances is the easiest, you are even further mistaken.
---
DPS warrior has to buy like half of his gear: Lionheart, Devilsaur Set, Edgemaster's, Cloudkeeper's, later on Titanic. 
---
You also compete with so many rogues and warriors in UBRS for Truestrikes and Dal Rend's set, all items that rarely drop. You can say don't take any other melee but good luck trying to find non melee that want to do Rend runs. 
---
Very hard to get Dal Rend's set without a guild helping you. 
---
The time of Vanilla being new has passed already. 
---
Many people will have a good clue on what they are doing, PUGs will require discord and RL will most likely be experienced and tell everyone what not to do. There will be alot of tanks so having decent ones are going to be easy. 
---
On top of that most fights are tank and spank or "kill skull, x,...". I think many exaggerate how many new players Classic will have. If you want to play WoW Classic you most likely played WoW  before. The majority who want to get, will get to raid. 
---
Get pre-bis and attuned, get invited to guild pugs that run for TF - profit
---
Mind control! I want to mind control every humanoid elite enemy and find my favorites.
---
counter argument- this is how servers end up w 40,000 players comprised of 98% one faction
---
TL; DR: Warriors are the most gear dependent and suck without gear. Warlocks and rogues scale well gear and miss out a lot from good itemization of raid sets if you don’t raid, but are strong pvp classes with enough utility they can probably get by with mediocre gear. All other classes all have at least some grear that aren’t very gear dependent or at least don’t miss out much itemization wise.
---
There’s a difference between gear dependence/scaling well with gear, and how much a class misses out from lacking raid items based on itemization. The following discussion is regarding pvp viability, everything is fine for dungeons.
---
It seems like feral Druid, elemental shaman, and shadow priest are classes that don’t miss out as much as other dmg dealers if they miss 100% of raids but can get the blue pvp set/maybe even some pieces from dungeon set 2 eventually. This is because the early tier sets are optimized with stats for different builds (healing), so if comparing yourself to the same class/spec, you are not as far from your raid-geared potential stats wise. AQ40 gear does typically provide ideal gear for many of these builds, but that’s late game raiding, so a smaller percentage of your peers will be outperforming you compared to if you choose something like warlock where you will be jealous of people getting good pvp gear from t1 onwards. However, if you will get some gear from molten core and blackwing lair, and just won’t progress to AQ onwards, these specs are unideal because you will struggle to gear ideal gear from the raids you can do and stop short of once it becomes more rewarding.
---
A feral Druid in rank 10 gear doesn’t miss out as much as another class, but that doesn’t mean it’s stronger, because feral druids aren’t exceptional in pvp in the first place.
---
A class like mage misses out a bit more than the previous 3 itemization wise, but is still better than some other classes. Early Mage tier gear doesn’t have much stam compared to something like warlock, so pvp gear is a good option. However, mage might be an even better choice than some of the above, because mage is an incredibly powerful pvp class in the first place, and also isn’t that gear dependent with all of your utility, as opposed to something like warrior. 
---
A class like hunter has BM spec which is very gear independent. Besides that, for marksman or survival pvp, hunters don’t scale as well as some other classes, and get pretty poor itemization for a while in later raids (AQ set sucks), so you won’t be THAT far behind a dedicated raider if you can get some basic items. You need a good weapon though, if you can do minimal tier 1 raiding, even pugs, rhokdelar is very easy to get, and is barely behind r14 weapons/BWL weapon, which themselves don’t really upgrade until naxx.
---
Rogues and warlocks, as stated at the top, scale pretty well with gear, I think, and get great pvp itemization from raid gear. I’m not an expert on rogues. I know naked rogues used to be a thing, but I think that got fixed with 1.12. You might want to ask others. Either way, the point is utility can probably compensate for lower dmg when things like stuns can control a fight. And a strong pvp class that’s not up to its full potential might be a better option than a weak pvp class at more of its full potential. It depends on how much you will be bothered by comparison to peers with same class/spec as opposed to individual performance against everyone. 
---
And I’m pretty sure healers in general can do well without too much gear. Ele shaman is also the healing spec and was already covered above. Though the priest pvp gear is itemized more for dmg for priests, it’s fine for healing focused priests as well, I think things like stam and armor are pretty important regardless of spec as opposed to more healing and regen from tier sets. I don’t know about resto Druid and pally itemization, but I think in general people say healers aren’t too gear dependent.
---
So I think you could argue just about anything except for warrior.
---
Mage seems like a great option that is a great pvp class, not too gear dependent, and not THAT hurt by missing out on raid items, and also good as a main toon for a casual that is great at farming gold, if you care about all of those points. Play what appeals to you, though.
---
Are undead or orcs better for pvp as a rogue 
---
I dunno, I mean I started in spring 2005, but 60 in 11 days sounds doable if you no-life it. Like I said I wasn't there for launch, but I remember as somebody else mentioned already lots of disconnect, lag, things like that. That wouldn't necessarily prevent somebody from logging back in and chugging along.
---
The guy was probably in the beta and was able to plan out a route to get ahead of the pack.
---
This guy herds cats ^
---
Minecraft 1.14, Halo 2, Hytale, Classic WoW, Avengers Endgame.
---
This year is amazing.
---
Yea don't get me wrong spirit is nice, and its sick as hell Post BWL, until then its hot garbage. Watch some of these high end guilds priest come into MC in the first 2 weeks of launch, and you will be just be shocked at how the meta has changed in the last ten years and how they choose their itemization stat priority. 
---
Whats even crazier is outside of a few pieces of T1, they will still be in blues come BWL. T2 though changes the priest game though, it really does. 
---
In vanilla when that happend.  They offered free transfers 
---
lolwat is going on this thread.
---
I don’t think there will be a beta, it would ruin a lot of the hype anyway. Either they have a few zones on weekends to stress test changes or reverts they’ve made, or they just drop the game on June 1st.
---
Side note I guarantee on April 1st they will say something dumb, either WoW mobile or they will have a 1 day beta of classic with LFG, Sharding, horde paladins, and basically everything the community doesn’t want....I would laugh anyway.
---
I have no clue
---
Agreed! I honestly believe they'll keep their word and it will only be used in the starting zones, and only for the first week or two. Hell, maybe less. 
---
If you remember the demo they had at Blizzcon, they put a time limit on how long you could play so that everyone could get a chance to play. People were pissed about it, but Blizzard went through with it. Half a day into Blizzcon they said Hey, the initial rush is over so we're disabling the timer. And they did. I have no doubt that Classic will go the same.
---
Interesting. Never heard of that site. I attempted to look up the top 3 on WarcraftRealms but the only one that survived seems to be Raz on LaughingSkull-US. Orc Shaman. First seen as Level 60 on December 17, 2004. The fact that the other two weren't recorded, ever, seems weird. It's like they rushed to 60 and rerolled?
---
&gt; 26/25
---
Would you mind sharing which talents to pick?
---
PI doesn't stack with Arcane Power, or at least it shouldn't in theory, but if it does stack it will become the meta and then PI is undeniably the best. 
---
Corpse walking a lowbie hunter to Teldrassil to tame an owl.
---
Thanks for agreeing with me on the Retail part. Your right and since Vanilla can't be consumed and hasn't been for some time then calling it "retail vanilla" is just incorrect.  
---
I had read the entire post when I realized it didn't say Redridge. That explains a lot.
---
Ungoro.. lovely zone and it makes me excited for being close to end game
---
Nice. I was gonna go with Li but decided a much cooler name would be Robert E Lee
---
I dunno about that....videogames are art and entertainment, which is an incredibly important part of society! Can you imagine life without music? books? painting? poetry? comedy? movies? tv? film festivals? concerts? It would be pretty fkn boring imo
---
That's about the same for my situation. She wants to come back but she's been corrupted by retail. 
---
You realize the person above you isn't me right? or did you drop out of school before learning how to read? 
---
Hi, /u/uuuumajgat
---
&gt; I subbed and now playing some BFA. 
---
I am sorry for your loss ;(
---
EU WoW was first released in February 11, 2005 according to the Wiki. I just remember how bad the WoW (US) launch was, especially during Christmas.
---
Yikes, not worth trying to convince you. The 15 years of WoW have not been kind to your brain.
---
Classes to avoid would be Elemental Shaman whose gear is from raiding, Holy Paladin (same), warrior who really only excels when they are in good gear. Other rogues are always going to be geared to and if you aren't you will die in a stun and they won't, so while they will be great initially, especially hemo spec, they will eventually be kind of mediocre without gear. 
---
Everything else should be fine though some come into their own later with blue pvp set and AV purples and some you can grab a item from MC and crush with it. In MC Hunter bow quest, Priest staff quest give very strong items and on other casters grab the 1 hand sword and get a offhand from AV. Enhance, Ret you get the AV 2 hander and before that Arcanite Reaper.
---
The idea of a video guide is intriguing to me -- a lot like what Joana has. If I ever get around to doing so I will let you know in a PM :).
---
Dwarf paladin.
---
I’m always the healer in our group of friends and we’re playing alliance, so Druid paladin priest are options.
---
You can’t see the druids gear 90% of the time and that actually bugs me, so they are out.
---
Priest is fun, and it was a toss up.....but I’ll be playing overseas on a US server so I’m expecting a bit of lag. With the healing toolkit a priest has, s delay could really screw things up.
---
Paladin is mainly useful for buffs and flash of light spam, short single target heals which delay won’t factor in as much. Also they are melee which is much easier with lag/delay. You don’t lose a full cast because someone walks around you in pvp and you can’t follow it with 300ms.
---
Paladin wins but only by a slight margin!
---
DW is fun above all else. And with proper weapons its not as bad as everyone says :)
---
PvE: Mages do higher DPS than Warlocks at all stages of the game except arguably AQ. Warlocks will always be brought along for curses and banish though so it's not something to be too worried about. Warlock PvE is basically curses + shadowbolt spam though there's a point to be made that it's insanely boring.  
---
PvP: Both are valid, really. Warlocks are probably slightly more versatile/powerful than mages, particularly if you get engineering to plug some of the weaknesses of the warlock. 
---
Prot is quite good for PvP.
---
I normally if all ways a rogue class but I still spell it rouge to get ppl worked up
---
It felt so exotic and rewarding to get to the later levels of the game. It felt really “out there”. 
---
Im looking forward to Azshara or Wintergrasp. They felt so remote. 
---
Not a specific zone, but I really enjoy high level dungeons.  I'll be almost sad to start raiding.
---
Oh for sure. Stormwind will have all the trainers it just means going out of your way a bit for the first 15 or so levels. 
---
Guy making Reich jokes in his username probably responded to the wrong thread judging by his shill-history
---
So...message your friend the server name so he chooses the right one when he gets on?
---
We don't even have a release date
---
There are constant posts about it....
---
Are you still confused?  If you dont care then feel free to don't worry about it but dont actively try to keep a shitty system in place.
---
&gt; PvE servers have nothing to do with the argument of fairness in PvP.
---
Yes they do, because players on PvE servers also play battlegrounds. PvP is not the private property of people on PvP servers.
---
&gt; And you bringing up power disparities is a argument made against yourself. If you think anyone in epics cannot one-shot someone in greens you're delusional. The amount of health is non-consequential.
---
They don't have five times the health and five times the damage. Or if they do it takes a hell of a lot more work than it does to gear a 19 twink.
---
&gt; No changes is a package deal.
---
One of many reasons "no changes" is a stupid slogan.
---
&gt; If you want "anything" then you don't want classic, especially if you're that kind of person who gets to pick and choose what people should enjoy and what not.
---
You see the irony, right? You're moaning about how *awful* it is for someone to "pick and choose what people should enjoy" while also announcing that your choice for what people should enjoy is the only acceptable thing for anyone to get?
---
&gt; The same actually the opposite of what you say is also true: unless you have mostly PvP gear (namely a resilience threshold, specially if on a durable/self-healing class) you'll be roflstomped unless you can avoid pretty much all the enemy's attacks
---
It just reduced crit and dot damage a bit.
---
no competition for rank 14... 
---
jokes aside I am curious to see what will happen 
---
I’ve played on a servers that were lowpop in Vanilla, and even if there are a lot of people leaving, the core community always survived. In some cases, yes free server changes were better.
---
Casual doesn’t necessarily mean a person wont make it to 60 and/or play end game, they just may take longer. Also the subscription being tied to retail should bring in a constant (even if small) flow of curious people.
---
Remember the game needs these causals, if you’re going hard-core think of them as the realm fillers that brings the world to life.
---
In my opinion this will be the best system.
---
1. Have loot trading only usable when you have master looter on.
---
2. You cannot change to loot system during combat, it must be out of combat. 
---
lol don't go train every time you can. You don't need every skill.
---
Dun Morogh. It will be my starting zone and I've never been.
---
Blizzard did state that the time table on certain patches will be wait and see. I guess the next question would be if these patches hit all servers at the same time or per server depending on progression.
---
It would suck for a casual friendly RP realm taking twice as long to progress and forced into patches they aren't ready for.
---
Doing just fine thanks. I do agree though, trying to talk to you is like listening to the the Microsoft Exec convenience the others that not having a start bar was a good idea. 
---
Always go for the gold upgrade 
---
Yeah, I thought this was what was going on.
---
I suspected most of the people whining "awww resilience broke PvP you couldn't PvP without resilience" were babies who never played TBC and who were repeating things they heard about Cata-era resilience.
---
TBC resilience just reduced crits and dot damage.
---
Best answer! This guy knows what he is talking about
---
Info will definitely filter down, but I have a group of about \~20-35 people coming back for classic. Not all of them are going to be making chars right at launch. Is it impossible to organize? Nah, but it would be easier if they would release server information.
---
That makes some sense. I guess I was unclear on what "ninja" meant. I always assumed it was meant for someone who did it on purpose. When someone accidentally did that I don't think I ever thought of them as ninjas. 
---
Yes “we” do.
---
yeah, me too buddy :-)
---
I don't think this is something you need to worry about. It would be incredibly silly to release vanilla just to make the characters made unplayable in classic later on.
---
&gt; One of the things we do know is that by announcing this, **we're in the WOW Classic business forever**. Once that starts, there's a commitment on our end that we're going to continue maintaining those servers for as long as there is a World of Warcraft. I think there will be people that come and do the nostalgia trip, they go to the Barrens and find Mankrik's wife, and then they're done. That's fine. Some amount of people, however, are going to create a new Classic community and that's what we'll be providing.
---
https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-11-04-wow-classic-blizzard-answers-some-of-the-big-questions
---
NE male Druid for tank/cat
---
So you've gone to all this effort so that *if* you group up with a non-clothie you can rip them off?
---
You realise that in 5-toon runs you could just pug a clothie for the last slot and get exactly the same result?
---
I think we're arguing about 2 different things, I'm not disputing your LBRS argument or that druids have it harder than other healers due to lacking  a rezz, I'm disputing a single sentence you made which implies very different things from what you're portraying.
---
In the post your made above you said " So if your druid healer is the only rezzer, the pressure is on to not making any mistakes. " , it implies that wipes only occur due to healer mistakes because dps/tanks can run around doing whatever they want as long as the healer doesn't do mistakes, whereas in truth the entire group should be focused on not doing mistakes, if only the healer is doing his job while the others aren't then you will wipe regardless of how well you healed, it's a group effort and not a single person/class feat.
---
What I meant with druids can run dungeons just fine is that if your group knows how to play their role in the group then deaths will be less likely to occur due to mistakes, which means that single deaths can be avoided and most wipes will be the entire party, in which case you will not need the rez anyway because you will all be corpse running back, hope this clears up the misunderstanding in my prior posts.
---
So, are you telling me Thor was an orc?
---
&gt;So overall: What do you think are the main issues of this comp? Is it too detailed and should I be looking to just work with what I get (player before class) or do you think it is a good goal to aspire to recruit like this? Are my restrictions ridiculous?
---
Prioritize the role first, then the player and lastly class/specc, but that is just my opinion. I have never had 50 people consistently show up so that I could just pick and choose amongs the classes in vanilla. You fill the roles first and often enough a tank, healer or a range dps is missing even altho you just recruited 2 new warlocks.
---
You weirdly seem to want to maximise the raid effectivity but wants to bring 4 hunters. I'm no expert but i belive you'll be happier to bring dps that can heal when its needed and cut a few healers in the beginning, i have a hard time seeing how that is not more effective if you are to bring the same people to 90% of your raids. You'll run into problems once you hit the later raids but in MC + BWL 12 healers are hardly always needed. Good people is hard to find to switching them for raid effectivity is not adviced. Getting the 40 people together and consistently is the hardest part so being picky about the composition is in my world a moot point as the content is not so hard that you cant have a shaman doing dmg until he is needed for healing in the later raids. 
---
Your question regarding feral druids can be solved with 1 going all out kitty dps and the other one going 100% bear, since horde have a much bigger problem with threat caps you'll be happy to have a fully tank specced druid doing the job, with all the rage and treath generation possible. Full [cat](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0x0VhoZx0gsfbdtV)  build (you can go a bit more extreme but the dps wont be worth it compared to the losses as a bear and situation). 100% [bear](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0x0V0oZxxxscMdtV0b) build to maximise treath, you can go and get insect swarm but that will reduce the tps. I found that if you are in the situation where you need a dodge to survive you might aswell have a rogue evasion tank it (broodlord lashlayer) when you are playing a feral druid.
---
In any case you'll be happier to bring the player and adapt to what you need depending on how reliable they are.
---
So people are afraid of the boogie man of loot trading.
---
replace the Hunter with a Druid, then.
---
Was it more than $4? You can buy that + the Brady's guide + the CDs off eBay for $4.
---
Who let you out of r/catholicism?!
---
Didn't know you played WoW
---
Like I said, I can kind of see it in UBRS pugs, the one really important 10-toon instance. Or in pug raids, maybe.
---
But for 5-toon stuff I don't see how it can matter much, and in guild raids you'll be using loot council or EPGP or something.
---
And there's a huge difference between "there could be some shenanigans in UBRS if three or four people get in and conspire" and "all loot in all 5-toon runs will be ninja looted run for the hills the sky is falling!".
---
Oh man, I thought this was a subtle jab at the Horde!
---
Yeah right. **Dal'rends IS hard for rogues. It's impossible in 1.12 unless you are in a guild run.** Easy on a warrior. You simply reserve it or invite casters. They are a dime a dozen on Horde and they are all sitting in town bored. 
---
I will be clearing MC by the time a rogue who isn't friends with a GM gets Dal'rends lol. At least on Horde. You probably have to take melee on Alliance and there aren't 10,000 Undead rogues and mages looking for a group and a VERY limited number of tanks for 5 mans and UBRS
---
Anyways have fun collecting all that tanking gear bud. You act as if it's hard to tank instances I mastered 15 years ago and have done repeatedly on private servers. 
---
Good luck convincing people not to play warrior. All other melee is pointless in 1.12. 
---
sure thing

---
You can really move a lot around with this spec but yeah if you want to ditch reckoning for holy power it's totally possible but I've healed all the way through BWL with this build and never had any issue. 
---
Didn't Halo Reach just come out?
---
There's nothing like paying $15 a month to fantasy RP as a human.
---
&gt;loot trading
---
I am raising the point there has been numerous posts on here.  Its a mentality of using reddit as a lobbying system.  We don't need to keep making new posts about this.
---
Considering I'm completely new to WoW (as in never played vanilla or retail) I've had to go fully off class fantasy and guides. 
---
I chose feral druid as I'd like to be an off tank but don't want to play warrior, and I've found a guild of friendly and helpful people that are okay with me playing feral, despite it apparently being not as good as other classes such as warriors and rogues.
---
Is this the same southwest portion of Stormwind that was destroyed later in the series?
---
Coming from a Horde perspective, I would be more adamant against gnomes.
---
Politics is never forced 
---
Find me an unused chicken mount card 
---
The thing is, literally everything you do in society is political in nature. 
---
I think the big problem is retail has a big enough problem as-is with Streamer servers being incredibly overloaded. 
---
Give people months of time ahead of time, and we could see servers that guys like Asmondgold play on hit 24 hour+ queue times, like some servers saw at the launch of WoD. 
---
It might sound like not a big deal to some who have not played the retail version of the game in some time, but server quantity imbalance is a huge mess. I don't think they want to accelerate that problem at all by announcing the servers too far in advance. 
---
I'm assuming you didn't try the Lashers below level 60 with that build? At 55 - 59 you NEED Holy Shield, otherwise you get pancaked.
---
I played Alliance. So I knew, for sure, I wanted Horde. I also knew, for sure, I wanted warrior. So orc warrior, or tauren warrior?
---
Tauren warrior would honestly look terrible I think in most sets compared to orc. So purely out of a process of elimination, I too know I'm going to roll an orc warr.
---
That was super awsome :D
---
Just a stupid thing to say, ''Oh games now a days are filled with forced politcal narratives,'' 
---
Games today reflect the politics of the times, just like they always have.
---
like every class there are good and bad.  Pally tanks are damn awesome for 5 man content, and as a mage I understand you have no taunt so slow steady aoe is sometimes better than throwing nukes from 30yrds.
---
Going to AV riding to the middle of the fields of strife and getting stunlock to death by a pair of rogues. I loved old school pvp.
---
The problem isn’t games forcing political views, the problem is people having such a strong opposition to political views that don’t align with their own 
---
My experiences is it is not easy to fill a UBRS run with a ton of casters. If you try to be the only melee in a UBRS run, people just leave. They don't want to roll against 15 other people for Briarwood Reed.  
---
How did I ever even suggest that it is hard to tank instances?
---
I just said you have to farm a lot of gold to buy the gear you need.
---
Playing a druid is super easy to gear and I would like to hear your argument about why it's harder than a warrior, which you say is the easiest to gear. 
---
I never said anything was hard, just that warrior is not the easiest. I am not trying to convince anyone not to play warrior. I didn't say anything about rotation or warrior being a bad class to play or anything. Where is all this coming from? 
---
O you tanked instances before? Congratulations lol.
---
Seriously you sound super bitter and toxic. This was just a normal discussion and you got jaded af when someone disagreed with you. Who hurt you?
---
Agreed. I don't want The Burning Crusade to be mandatory should it come out. Players should have a choice to play either Classic or TBC.
---
This would keep the Vanilla servers intact for a lifetime. Giving us lifers a chance to enjoy the game at our own pace.
---
Completely agree. But I think for most content it's fine. I clicked and keyboard turned through all of MC. It's mostly fine. 
---
Yes, that’s the quote I was looking for, thanks! You’re probably right. It’s just difficult to keep that in mind sometimes, what with Classic content creators theorizing about Classic TBC and what not. And don’t get me wrong, I’d be elated to see Classic TBC after a while, I just don’t want to be forced to play there until I’m ready.
---
Don’t forget about the magical soundtrack music that plays there  too. So mystifying.
---
Are you telling me AQ40 is not challenging?  Twin emps, Huhu and c'thun?  Are you sure you raided in vanilla?  Yes mechanically they were not "complex" but they were seriously difficult, considering our guild had server firsts in ZG and BWL yet we NEVER killed twin emps and only brought down Huhu about 3 maybe 4 times.
---
The average guild will struggle to clear AQ40, you mark my worse :D
---
I'm not confident in that happening. At least not to any meaningful degree. No private server will have the amount of support, account security, and lack of downtime that Blizz servers have. In addition to that, WoW is an MMO. So people want to play where the other players are.
---
Unless Blizzard dramatically changes a bunch of stuff, which isn't looking likely, I don't think many people will miss playing Classic.
---
Yea knowing thw physical location would help. Getting ~200ms or &lt;10ms makes a huge difference. Not having to spend the first 30 min finding the correct one would be nice.
---
It was in vanilla before spell queueing was in the client. Definitely won’t exist in Classic with Legion base client.
---
Somebody’s only played private servers
---
Nah I never did lashers until lvl 60, from what I've heard tho yeah holy shield goes a long way for people AOE grinding to 60 in DM 
---
It really can’t be anything but the players, if the players leave the game dies. 
---
&gt; Are you telling me AQ40 is not challenging? Twin emps, Huhu and c'thun?
---
Compared to mythic raiding now? That's the comparison.
---
Classic raids aren't mechanically difficult, it's about getting 40 people to do what they need to do.
---
And yes I raided, I cleared KT in classic wow (in retail), hit a real wall at saph for a while (getting 40 people to spread out exactly where they need to be was rough). And yes I agree AQ40 had quite a few hurdles to overcome, but it won't be as bad as previously, when we had no information share. Now there's videos, guides, tons of other resources you can look up or other guilds on other servers you can talk to when you hit a wall.
---
In classic, everything was hush hush, and not every mechanic was reverse engineered day 1.
---

Never thought I would see a Rich Dad Poor Dad reference on here
---
1. Being carried applies whether there are achievements or not.
---
2. I couldn't tell you the top guilds on my server when I wasn't raid regardless of achievements, why?  Because if I'm not raiding I really don't give a fuck about someone who is.
---
They would not put in the work to backport the game just to scrap it two years later.
---
Shhhhh!
---
Dw is actual trash regardless of weapons while leveling for the MOST part.  Simply due to not having enough hit.  You just miss way too much to make it worth while.  2h Fury is the best way to go until 40 imo.
---
I've been on a few low pop pserver realms and at below about 1000 av becomes tough to play, below a few hundred is when raiding becomes difficult. Basically you want at least 1000 or so as a vague rulw of thumb so all content is accessable.
---
Priest, Hunter, holy paladin.
---
You are the one trying to convince people not to play the best melee class in 1.12 while selling fairy tales about how they are magically harder to gear than rogues (who can't even get in dal'rends runs in private). You are probably bad and worried about that raid spot because melee all reroll to warrior on private. BTW? Guess who is getting Ashkandi first. The one who will dps with it on a slam 2 hand spec that all the "dime a dozen" bad warrior dps you mentioned won't do. Have fun with those 1 handers in pvp man. You can backpedal around like hulksmash.
---
First person to play send the others a text with the server and faction? Problem solved.
---
Yeah, while some people might select the imbalanced faction if they could see the %, I would think more would select the opposite, in favor of the stronger side (number wise, at least).
---
I don't see a need for this, not at launch anyway.  
---
What a joke. I am not trying to convince anyone not play warrior. This is a threat called fastest class to gear, not convince me to play a class. You are claiming DPS warrior is the fastest class to gear, and I am disagreeing. That is all. Stop putting words in my mouth. 
---
No, I have a raid spot in my guild. Thanks. Already have an Ashkhandi on private server too. 
---
Again, who hurt you? Why are you this way? 
---
Rise against song on the playlist is a sure sign this is authentic 
---
A feral druid would use a 2H weapon.
---
Everybody boosted to 60, free PVP R14 gear, all realms become PVP, teleported to a random spot in STV with no way out.
---
Scared shitless.
---
No. Beating a dead, twitching horse. They had character transfers in Vanilla. 
---
nice! t'etais sur quel serveur?  
---
i'm so hyped about classic :D  i was a noob back in the days but now i'm prepared, i'm coming for you kel thuzad!
---
Downvoted, got the joke, then upvoted 
---
DR's (if they were in 1.12?) Are 25 sec. Stealth needs 6sec. Blind lasts 8.
---
Either you get opened on before blind fades or you create distance and open in 25. 8sec should be enough to create enough distance for demo a shout (even if you were slow af in stealth back then)
---
i miss vanilla..
---
A feral ninja would still roll on it
---
In other threads you are flaming about "autistic" private server players. And then you talk like this. Pretty ironic lol.
---
Racist = great people??? o.O
---
Isn't there some sort of age-restriction on reddit that you are clearly ignoring?         
---
If not, there should be.
---
And warriors are fastest to gear because they get groups instantly and have the power to control who comes. Get it now? NM just talk about how you have a 2 hander that you were somehow given as the main tank because you seem to think all warriors have to MT raids. What kind of fail guild is that? Or did you get last on all the warriors, which proves my point that MT's are suckers unless they are PVE tryhards who come to PVP servers to raid with better players, which exactly what I stated in my first post lol.
---
I have nothing against the pve try hards on their troll warriors, I just have no interest in doing it. Now if you aren't Horde and you are talking about tanking and skill? L O L You play the faceroll faction where bad tanks can get by due to salvation.
---
Have a nice life man. Have fun getting gear for people who actually pvp on a pvp server. We really appreciate you. *snickers*
---
No way you couldn't tell the top guilds of your server if you were max level dude. At least the #1 guild.
---
I mean recognizing individuals? Yeah no bloody way. But I KNOW people who had &lt;The Logical Cube&gt; under their name pranced around in pink lightning armor and seemed to find the presence of other DPS in their run as significant as non combat pets. I KNOW guys with &lt;Deus&gt; under their name are fancy prancy people because they spammed Trade for 2 hours when Archimonde died.
---
Lots of strawmen here my dude. I didn't say that they didn't think classic would be successful, so you can highly doubt it all you want. I said it appears that they aren't interested in it as a lucrative product. Just because something "increases their bottom line in some form or fashion" doesn't mean it's a lucrative product. I also didn't say that classic would hurt the company financially, nor did I say they are doing it out of their passion for the game. These are all arguments you made up.  
---
You argued that Classic WoW would likely be lucrative, and that Blizzard should be thanking the customers for finding them such a lucrative product.  
---
I argued that Blizzard likely doesn't view classic as a lucrative product, based on the evidence of their earnings call where they literally said it wasn't a major release, and also the evidence that they are doing literally nothing to monetize the game (You essentially get it as free DLC for playing the current game).  
---
Therefore, my conclusion would be that Blizzard is creating Classic WoW to foster goodwill in their community and pull more players back into their subscription, and most importantly to avoid the negative backlash of not creating it. This WILL likely be financially beneficial for them both in terms of actual sub growth and in terms of community perception, but it by no means appears to be very lucrative, and they do not seem to anticipate that it will be very lucrative.  
---
I'm sure the small team working on Classic IS passionate about the game, but it would seem that Blizzard is creating Classic because the negatives of not creating it are very bad, not because the positives are "lucrative."
---
As a classic NE player, I salute!
---
That movie is brutal. Hands down the best war movie made. It's free on youtube also. [Come and See](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJYOg4ORc1w). Afaik the kid actor had legit ptsd and had aged at much quicker rate than his peers, simply due to filming the movie.
---
It's a must see.
---
ಠ_ಠ I will not sacrifice my damage, i'll just die and blame you for it. 
---
They're doing it because it makes them money. Period. This fanboy mind set is far more damaging than any "complaining" ever could be.
---
So. Cringey. 
---
I never said any of this shit. You have some deep pent up issues with this game it seems. All tanks have to MT raids? What are you even talking about? Where are you getting this anger?
---
"You are talking about people so mentally ill they get rank 14 every year and dedicate months to it and who speedrun instances to impress no one but a few hundred people. It's a group of like 500-1000 people that have no job, no life and no prospects who pick on a revolving door of mediocre players who try a private server out"
---
Seems like you were projecting when you wrote this lol. 
---
Yes, very impressive, you are a big dick PVP warrior player. Congratulations. 
---
Customer, or consumer... Pick one.
---
English is my third language, what is yours?
---
Why are you even talking about what race you would play? This conversation is literally coming out of nowhere lol wtf.
---
This is why Deadmines &gt; Jurassic 'Wailing Caverns' Park
---
I don't do rank 14. I kill the mentally ill, jobless rank 14's post tier 2. The try hard pve players on pvp servers like you don't pvp. You are mad at me for stating how it is. You want ALL warriors to get raid tanking gear and then look down on dps warriors when they are the strongest melee dps in 1.12. I didn't make Classic 1.12 and break it like this. Private servers did and Blizzard followed their lead. The private servers probably did it to sell gold/gear to wannabe Swifty's.
---
Sorry I am not going to bring rogues to my pre raid BIS runs. Neither are most warriors. **Post the LFG world channel on the private server you are playing on atm. What does it say. LFM Ranged, XXXX reserved.**
---
Have fun in the delusion and self importance "main tank". 
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxlO8F\_\_7Fk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxlO8F__7Fk) 
---
By that logic that means there are more druids in raids Horde side so it's harder to hear horde druids, and less druids alliance side so it's easier to gear alliance druids if you get a spot...
---
I really like Western Plaguelands. It's chill and full of farms. Not as gloomy was Eastern. I just wish there was an actual quest hub town or city. They completely ruined Andhorhal in Cata.
---
Without reading the comments, I say go Alliance. The PVE game is stronger and the aesthetics are superior. 
---
I play Horde where we exchange our self respect for superior racials; unless you play troll. ;)
---
Does that mean you always say "loose" instead of "lose"? :thinking:
---

---
Like I said you don't play Horde and have no idea. Now go back to that Alliance "main tank" and make sure to bring a paladin so you can hold aggro lol. Now I really am done with this conversation. I would say I would see you in BG's but all you are going to do is AV. I would say thanks for getting us the gear in raids but you couldn't handle tanking Horde side.
---
To all the Horde MT's? Thanks for the gear and we understand why you don't PVE on pve servers with back peddlers. Those guys aren't telling us to collect pre raid BIS tank gear as dps though like this chump.
---
Nah dude. I was a beta kid and a vanilla kid before a private server kid. My being a private server kid is a result of being a vanilla kid.
---
I read what you wrote about Naxx exp and so forth. Trust me the meta has changed drastically. I rolled a hunter on Nost with the same mindset as you, "I was the best hunter on the server back in the day." Nah, I got fucked hard, real hard, and that was if I was lucky enough to get a group. It was still fun, just saying.
---
If you want to see it in a helpful way just see the private server people as fierce competition. But it's kind of silly to pretend that some of their extra 90 days /played on 2015-2019 vanilla meta is pointless experience. That's just silly thinking lol.
---
It’s either this or more “release date???” posts.
---
HIGHER ON THE STREET
---
This is legit the cringiest video relating to WoW.
---
Even worse it was an actual aired commercial.
---
I just want total number of fish caught, or largest fall distance, or total gold made from vendoring, or largest crit, total healing done etc.  
---
I have no idea why people stiff arm this.
---
You seem to forget that Nyhm was a thing then.
---
I knew other guilds existed over the last 15 years but never had a clue as to their ranking other than number of times I saw them a day outside of cities lol. I couldnt give a shit about raiding most of the time. Maybe I'll give it a whirl this time.
---
.... I never said dps warriors need to get tank gear. I thought you were talking about gearing as a tank warrior, as others in this thread have suggested that MT is the easiest class to gear. 
---
Again, you are delusional. 
---
Blacksmithing and leatherworking. The sheer number of warriors buying lionheart helms and devilsaur gloves and pants.
---
Warrior priest mage leading the way, that's a solid core of any 5 man
---
I think OP's asking about phases as defined by Blizzard's content plans - ie raiding-level
---
After I made my comment I browsed wowprogress archives and holy fuck I thought Deus was the #1 guild in Darkspear EU TBC, wtf, Club Drama and lords of light both killed Archimonde before them? Trade Chat fucking **lied** to me.
---
The slippery slope is called a logical fallacy for a reason.
---
No. It's going to be released as part of the Master Chief Collection on Xbox One as well as PC. It was previously available on Xbox One as a backwards compatible title but that doesn't really count. It's just emulation of the 360 version and the playerbase is still dying.
---
Also people being unwilling to change shitty behavior even though they know it’s shitty 🙃
---
A simple solution that will work in the long run, but fuck you over in the short term; find which servers the more notable WoW streamers are going to play on. Play on that server. 
---
You’re guaranteed a large playerbase that will probably stay active longer than the servers without said streamers and their communities. 
---
The downside is that the server will probably be pop locked, server resources will be scarce. But at least ppl will be there. 
---
If you check his post/comment history he's actually either a propaganda bot or just a massive piece of shit.
---
I'm not worried.  If there's only one large guild on each faction it wouldn't bother me.  
---
Extreme faction imbalance is the fear of mine.  Anyone who played Horde on Alleria will tell you, it's really fucking awful.  
---
Kazzak has a short enrage timer so that wouldn't work
---
Hell yeah bro.
---
That's fucking *amazing*.
---
I totally forgot about reforged. More so excited for custom games then anything else.
---
Fishing is the hidden sleeper for cash
---
Being inspector gadget with Engineering is the only way to be competitive in pvp
---
Goddam you are right. Man i love 10.000 Days
---
Like the other guy said, I'll stress this, those things are really not challenging compared to modern Mythic.
---
You're definitely right that the average guild will struggle to clear AQ40. But any guild that was even top 1000 retail in the past few years will not find it particularly complex to clear vanilla--just really stressful due to the sheer amount of players etc.
---
I thought Blizz was putting in faction caps to help balance?
---
troll hunters rise up! i made a ton of alts on the server that must not be named to see what i liked, but there's just something about roaming azeroth as a troll with just a bow and your pet cat tbh. 
---
i'm still conflicted on the server, though... definitely a rp server, but pve or pvp? a friend of mine is gonna try classic wow, and ideally i'd like to have most of my characters on the same server as them to screw around on if they decide they like classic, and they'd prefer pve, but i'd prefer pvp, so maybe main pve and an alt on pvp if they stick with it? there's also the point of, i don't mind world pvp/ganking so much now, but what about when i have less free time? so it's hard to decide on that, but i guess i've got plenty of time to think it over lol
---
As I said above, I was under the impression there was going to be some kind of faction balancing algorithm. Also, what's the harm in listing server times?
---
I hope Classic, stays classic for as long as it lives. I don't tbc, wrath progression after. i just want it to stay vanilla, no expansions after it!
---
Barman Shanker
---
It's pretty uncontested that they look best in Dreadnaught.  It's basically a death knight outfit before there were death knights.
---
Why the hell did you post this. This only reminds me of work... Screw you
---
It's something they probably won't get to until a year or two down the road, but I do really like the idea of Classic-only servers mixed with ones that progress through TBC and WotLK.
---
IMO Classic through WotLK was "peak WoW" and I'd love to have the experiences of raiding Karazhan or Icecrown Citadel again someday. But I also get that not everyone is going to feel the same way, and keeping a place that stays at 60 cap forever seems entirely reasonable.
---
I do hope that if TBC/WotLK are introduced they offer free server transfers from the Classic-only realms to people who want to progress to the next expansion. I'd hate to invest a year or more into my Classic character then have to start fresh for a Classic + TBC server, then again for Classic + TBC + WotLK.
---
Coming from an Alliance perspective, I would agree. 
---
Such a hard question - an extra fear/charm/poly break is great but I think I'd rather avoid 25% of stuns because we have no extra defence against them.
---
First bridge fight in Alterac Valley.
---
Even if they got everything else wrong, as long as Alterac Valley is good, I'll be a happy customer.
---
??? What’s the problem here 
---
It's doable.  GF and I plan to travel from Darnassus to Northshire - gotta get her to experience THAT fun run.
---
If we're talking pre-disney walking animations i actually really loved it imo, it felt heavy and slow as it should for a huge bulky walking talking cow, now they just made every race feel bouncy/hoppy and that they defy physics, it just does not feel right at all to me, although to be fair the retail tauren animations aren't too bad its still further apart from realism and makes me feel like the game is in a much less serious thematic tone than what it was.
---
And for those arguing "It's not a game about realism", i'd have to disagree to an extent, i think wow originally had that sense of realism and seriousness to it, although quite obviously the majority of it was fantasy i still miss that 20% of a realistic gritty brutal theme.
---
Who would buy that lol - the Key is likely already used, the actual box and CDs are useless.

Story of Classic WoW

I don’t know what it is but looking at the griffin shots and the people below who had no idea that picture was been taken and it reappears years later makes me sad about the good times we’ve had in the old days

They all have their benefits. I'd highly recommend you take a look on YouTube. Frostadamus has some great videos on each profession. 
---
2010. Not very long ago.
---
But REmake came out in 2002 when RE1 had only been out for 6 years. So I guess this makes sense.
---
Everyone's gonna be pissed off if there isn't a server in their time zone with the same name as their original Vanilla server – which there won't be, because a modern server can handle more players and there will be fewer of them overall.  So I guess they'll wait until the last minute to reveal how many servers there will be and what they'll be called.
---
AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH
---
People can’t even see your spec 
---
They'd probably be worth 8,000G with "requires level 29".
---
Once again if I'm not raiding why would care about who's raiding enough to bother remembering their name?
---
Word, dawg.
---
The insults are always what's taught first in class.

Thank you, I've not heard of this film.  I'll have to check it out.

No shit. Name a for profit company that doesn't do this... Its the literal point of for profit companies. Why is this said around these parts as if its some grand wisdom? You guys sound like 12 year olds who just discovered capitalism when you drop this "gem" as if its profound.
---
Fishing is the best. You just chill and passively generate income. 
---
You seem to be misunderstanding something. I even explicitly said that there's no way you'd be able to remember player names. I simply said, there's no way you can play at max level in vanilla-tbc and not know the names of some top level guilds, if only because of the Trade spam whenever they clear something.
---
Don't look at me, see the guy above that is talking as if Blizzard is his old friend from back in the day.
---
Essentially having people scream "your talents are one point off from optimal, go die in a fire!" has always been min/maxers least likeable quality. That or mid dungeon watching them have a breakdown because the other DPS did a-a-b instead of b-a-a 
---
Generally the first eleven levels are handled in a starting zone. Westfall for example is your first zone outside of the human starter zone. (Stormwind excluded.)
---
Was darkshore supposed to be westfall for nightelves? 
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but i think they had the same level range. I was there for a while but my friends said all alliance went to westfall around lvl 10-11
---
Fishing!
---
Well obviously no one knows yet, but I think realistically any congestion problems in the 1-5 zones will also be just as bad in the 5 - 15 zones, it's really no to at least lvl 20 when people will start fanning out more and mobs/quest items won't just be crushed with players for the first week.
---
I love Nyhm though.
---
Don’t make me get my mai......ahh fuck it. 
---
Feralas

Do you really love stump, or are you just saying that you love random things around Darkshore?

Sure there is, you simply have to not care about top end raiding.  Which believe it or not a lot of people don't.
