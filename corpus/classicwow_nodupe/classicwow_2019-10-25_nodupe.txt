The only thing in this video that actually bothers me is when i whisper someone looking for group members and they just dont reply.

---
Bitch just say no.

---
---
Rogues are pretty bad at mob grinding. Plus youre foghting a mob that is a counter to your damage. Id farm humanoids.
---
You have four fingers on your right hand....
---
weapon skill above 305 has really low effect(and caps at 308), meaning aged core leather gloves are worse than t1 gloves, but combined with t1 or t2 legs they are better than devilsaur, but not worth breaking alone.
---
Hey so I've got the TSM desktop app running and synced, along with Auctionator. However the data from tsm is not syncing or showing. I have the TSM Addon installed but disabled, as I just want to use Auctionator.
---
So it looks like I will have to use the TSM Addon if I want the desktop client data? It isn't working with Auctionator otherwise.
---
Yup, specifically Swamp of Sorrows, Stranglethorne Vale, Ferelas and Desolace.
---
Aye especially considering how powerful it is against some opponents. I mean if a Chess Master was allowed to us a Power Move to convert all pieces to Queens for one turn but it costs even half time on the clock - the choice becomes only when to do it since it's such a massive advantage. Some people gripe about "you used cooldowns" or used a potion - like someone racing a car is arbitrarily only allowed 2 gears and limited to 4000rpm.
---
Oh... the goblins give rep for Booty Bay, not Bloodsail Buccaneers...

I hope I didn't confuse anyone.

What's the raid frames add-on the main tank is using?

While you're at it, the "pillars" at the start of the path out of un'goro to silithus.
---
I could not explain fights, or worse explain fights wrong.  I could not know any of the pulls ahead of time.   There are a lot of things you can do badly without loot ever being involved.   Keeping 40 people passionate about something when they are either not getting loot because of chance or not getting loot because they already have it is a much bigger task than you seem to believe.

Zoram strand is where it's at, got maxed for my level in no time, thank you.

Awesome idea!

And most of the rogues rolled warrior.

I love how the serving Suggestion is just one Ravioli
---
Seeing how it's a laptop it's most likely overheating, check your temps!
---
You can level just fine as a holy prot spec.  It's slow but all pally leveling is slow.  You can aoe some mobs while questing and heal or tank dungeons as well.
---
....What?
---
Most people won't be playing in a year tbh.
---
One of my most vivid memories of playing this game is 15 years old, I was doing this quest and working the Burning Stepps demon.  I waited till about 4am to do it to avoid anymore hiccups as it was a competitive server with tons of hunters trying to do it, and many of them would troll you just to ruin it the tag.
---
I set my alarm to 3:30 am, had a cup of coffee and headed over.  That's the easiest of the demons to kill, I had it down to almost dead when some fucking 50ish Paladin ran by and doubled back towards me, I knew he was coming to help or buff or whatever.  I couldn't type to him without ruining the kitting I was doing and risk dying.  It didn't matter, dude ran up and threw a flash heal thinking he was gonna save me, despawning the demon.
---
I couldn't chew him out, he was just being helpful.
---
Fucking asshole.
---
What chat mod do you have to show colours/classes?
---
Quite the opposite, they're invisibull.
---
It's a weakaura. The import is linked in the comments.

*Laughs in PVE server*
---
Compare 4000 blackmouth oil vs 300 free action potions
---
okay, now this is epic
---
Like an inferior version of the windreavers.
---
And that is what matters. Pros and cons to both, pick which one works best for you.
---
[removed]
---
Thats the one!
---
Sure, u can do it, but you're basically leeching off everyone you group with. The best retadin I ran with was full BiS - had SGC, hoj, etc. He pulled the same dps as the fresh 60s in greens. Is that the "dream"?
---
Different games use different shaders, effects, resolutions even. You may have a card going bad, but the items it needs to run league are not corrupt yet. Just a thought. 
---
In any case, this happened to me on another game a couple years back. I too hoped it was software, but replacing card "fixed" issue. Card was just overheated or old and degraded. Same effect though. Except mine was horizontal and vertical wtfness. Not that diagonal. Makes me wonder if you can turn off a certain function that is drawing at a diagnal.
---
Only sad thing is that you instantly turned and runmed away :(
---
Yea, not to parrot what everyone else is saying but its your card or the drivers. I would do a clean install of the updated driver - restart the pc and then see if its fixed. If its not - you might have to eat the cost on a new card.
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Supposedly per AtlasLoot, the drop rate is 4.76%.  
---
&gt;This means at 47 runs, you’re expected to see the trinket AT LEAST once with a 90% probability.
---
wot?
---
that's close to 5% chance, which means once every 20, so by the time you did your 50th run you should had statistically 2 chances to roll for it.
---
Let's assume that the drop chance is 5% to simplify some numbers here...
---
If you mean "what is the chance to finding it at the 50th run" then the answer is (0,95 )\^49 \*(0,05) \* 100 %, which is slightly lower than 5%
---
If instead the question is "what is the chance to find it at the next run" then the answer is 0,05, regardless if your run is the 5th, 50th or the 500 th since it's a time-invariant chance.
---
Okay thank you. That makes more sense.
---
I mean if people are looking to kill time waiting for phase 2 go make an alt 
---
Leveled and geared my paladin now I’m leveling a hunter
---
Pull the lever Kronk!
---
Damn ty
---
Sorry but you meant 'getting geared as a RESTO druid is pretty easy.' 
---
Signed a feral druid
---
Nice
---
Explain how its not unfair to let a rogue open up on me or to wait to get charged by a warrior first before doing anything
---
There's also learning to be had. Standing on top of a rogue while you're mounted for the countdown before a duel starts is not an opportunity you'll have in world PvP. You may know he's there, but you need to get rage and shout him out with limited information on where he is based on last seeing him at render distance.
---
Though, if you're not looking to learn or improve, you can have your victory with no reward. People may also elect not to reduel because they are trying to learn and get better too, and don't want to waste time doing the opposite.
---

Teldrasil deserves to be burned

I mean the damage increase that others receive could be credited to the Druid on the meters.

I see what you did there.

Tirisfal glade. I loved starting as undead
---
Look here’s what you do.  Delete your character.  Create a new alliance one.  Prosper.
---
Warriors and rogues would like to speak with you...
---
This is the choice you made rolling on a PvE server, by sacrificing the threat of world PvP while leveling you've essentially given up on all endgame PvP content bar a handful of encounters until Battlegrounds come out. 
---
Blizzard released their content plan well ahead of vanilla so everyone could see that battlegrounds weren't going to be available immediately, and it was obvious that all the endgame PvE content would be on farm status within weeks looking at how private servers had to artificially up the difficulty to still make it challenging. 
---
I don't think Blizzard should accelerate their phased content because you are bored on a PvE server.

---
This. As long as people play 1 hour a month content is practically limitless.
---
Do low-level elites count? For example can I get this by farming RFC?
---
So, keep in mind that I'm an old Vanilla player that played as a warrior and play again as a warrior.  I actually haven't found a *need* for macros, but keybinds are a must. I also prioritize key position from left to right in order of precedence. As an Example, defense stance: Sunder / Revenge / Shield Block are my first 3 abilities... I put everything on the left so that way I can use my mouse to turn.
---
# Changing Stances
---
* F1: Battle Stance
---
* F2: Defense Stance
---
* F3: Berserker Stance
---
# Shouts
---
* Shift + 2: Battle Shout
---
* Shift + 3: Demo Shout
---
# Impairment
---
* Shift + 4: Hamstring
---
* Shift + 5: AOE Fear
---
# Mounting
---
* Backspace : Ground Mount
---
* (For Retail):  flying mount = Shift + Backspace
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also, Taunt / Mocking blow both utilize the "6" key. So if I'm in battle or defense, I can hit 6 to get aggro.
---
Same boat as you man. Saw my first hoj only after 101 kills. Guild rogue won it so I'm still on the grind.
---
Being hit while sitting will induce crits on you in classic wow. But specifically thesesitting-crits will not give you reckoning stacks, that was a thing on p-servers only.
---
I never liked having multiples of the same class in a dungeon group 
---
I mean I’ll do it but I feel like variety is the spice of life.
---
Pfft are crazy.  Armor on my ram looks sick AF
---
You're right, I don't know much about locks. I mistakenly thought it was Curse of Agony that was the 'one use only'. When someone pointed out that it wasn't. I, then, thought "oh, maybe I was thinking of Unstable Affliction". Never once said UA was in Vanilla.
---
...are you saying you never made the mistake of thinking one ability had the characteristics of another; irregardless of whether or not that other ability was in 'this version' of a game?
---
The mob tagging is also errant, but that's because any time my mobs been hit by other players, I still must have done enough damage to no be penalized. - I also recalled reading about players leaving dungeon groups to solo-tag and having the group kill the mob, then reinviting the solo player before they got booted; giving them all the XP meant for 5 players.
---
That's where that information came from. Of course I haven't tested this because I have no one really to test it with, and I don't feel like spinning up more WoW Subscriptions.
---
((Sure, I could probably Google and find the answers. But in order to know to look for those answers, you have to first be told you are wrong in your current knowledge.))
---
*After reading up on the mob tagging, I wouldn't recommend it. It seems Blizzard doesn't really have a set of rules; one GM told Athene it was fine, another gave him a 3 day suspension.*

---
Lol at the ‘news’ flair.
---
At launch 1 layer held 1 full vanilla realm worth of players (2000 or 2500 players, don't remember which), Ion said it himself. And according to Blizzard, not a single realm had a double digit amount of layers, meaning, no realm had more than 22.5K concurrent players. Nost had ~17K concurrent players at high points and the playerbase was consistently around 15K, even months into it. Player retention was probably much higher than retail classic, so I'd say it's pretty fair to assume that by now, they have a comparable population.
---
You’ve gotta add them to friends now. It’s destiny.
---
Im not sure. I only considered downloading it but decided against it. But if you're open to suggestion i would recommend Bartender4, SexyMap, Zperl Unit Frames, WeakAuras and TitanPanel. With these I've been able to construct a rather minimalist UI while still displaying all pertinent information.
---
Nice hot take. I'll file this under the rest of the "OP's that don't know what the fuck they're talking about"
---
&gt;"Only one Unstable Affliction or Immolate per Warlock can be active on any **one** target."
---
You can put on multiples, but it's like CoA in that you can only have one per mob. If it was only 1 UA overall, it would read:
---
&gt;"Only one Unstable Affliction or Immolate per Warlock can be active on any target."
---
Sungrass sucks too
---
I use an addon called Dracarys that makes my unit frame look like that.
---
As soon as the duel starts and the rogue stealths I'm either r1 blizzard or r1 AE to get him out. Im never going to wait for him to open on me. 9/10 of he will get the open on me regardless but im not going to sit and wait to get stun locked
---

I used the past tense a lot.
---
Grim Batol in wetlands. So peacefull place with nice backround story. I like going there to relax :)
---
I usually try to buy a green headpiece and necklace around 25-28. There's a good leather one that drops (horde only) in Hillsbrad in the Dun Garok area.
---
I try to not buy gear as I'm leveling unless its an empty slot, then I'll buy a piece to fill that slot once. If the gear gets really outdated then I'll upgrade it potentially.
---
True enough, it's not the most glamorous leveling process in the world, but its the price one pays for being the best support class in the game
---
You can also get a little more minimalist with chinchilla map. Just a square with a super thin border and coords in frame. Cut the fancy to squeeze in a corner.
---
Supreme story.
---
Nice Egan's Blaster, to boot! ;)
---
I love puggle.  Reading lfg chat is impossible
---
Actually a great idea
---
and this is where we disagree.  when it hits them in the wallet and pve server players don't re-up their subscriptions to farm mc for the next 6 months the pain will be felt on all servers.  developers / customer service people fired, re-distributed, etc that support all servers.    maybe some saw it coming that pvp servers would have more content but that's not the players fault on pve servers that they didn't have a crystal ball.... it's on blizzard to alter their plans and fix it.
---
done lbrs with 3 priests and a rogue with me tanking on a warrior, it took 3 hours, you need some decent damage out put, be that mage/lock/hunter or even a fury warrior, having no real aoe was a real pain in the arse
---
I gave up on farming it and just bought the DM trinket. 
---
As you said I don't think its as great for dagger rogues, I also have the perd blade :D
---
More hit% = more sword hits = more hoj/sword swing procs = more damage. Also more hit = more crits in the end.

Horde from fairbanks, very chill experience from my experience so far. Few gankers here and there with a fraction of them being 60's coming to shit on lower levels before honor system is in place. There have been massive PvP brawls that break out spontaneously that'll calm down and everyone just goes back to mob grinding again side by side. In the end, PvP for sport but everyone has to grind to level at some point.
---
As I don't raid, even LFR (except if I may feel like it/quest), I'm focusing on account stuff.
---
Transmog, flight, mounts, pets and allied races are some examples of timeless advancement.
---
Even professions are fleeting.
---
Im Personally fond of Dominos
---
Probally too late.. ooen your computer up and throw a fan on that video card
---
Do I have to be 225 in order to fish in those places?
---
In vanilla I got a HoJ and Ironfoe first run of BRD, 
---
But I was a pants on head moron then.
---
Lmao love it
---
As a rogue, should i put talent points into deflection to get Riposte ASAP, or should I put my first tier 2 points into precision for additional +hit?
---
Someone's gonna get laid in college...
---
Ok thanks, i see them all over the place and feel so out of the loop
---
IDK why everyone is cringing at this. I think it's hilarious. Next, do Naga and StarKist tuna hehe
---
Ganondorf. Epic name
---
This was 15 years ago, as a Feral druid on a PvP server, with dial up Internet, being ignorant, *walking home from school uphill both ways in the snow.*
---
"but the utility!" they scream as the tank dies and they don't hoj, loh, heal,  bop a non-tank etc etc
---
Because your 31 point ret talent isn’t as impactful as say,  mortal strike is (repentance is a PvP gap closer/soft cc/heal time buyer), you can easily do your first 11 into holy and then start ret. 
---
Personally I would do 
---
- divine strength 5/5
---
- spiritual focus 5/5
---
- conc 1/1 
---
And start ret with 
---
- benediction 5/5 (this is a personal choice because I prefer sustain to the mediocre increase from improved might. You are going to be rotating blessings on yourself in world PvP and dungeons anyway. Benediction also synergises with my tier two choices which are..)
---
- 2/2 improved judgement and 3/3 improved seal of the crusader 
---
- 1/1 seal of command 
---
This is the most mana efficient combo of entry points as it allows you to:
---
Seal of crusader - judge - seal of command - fight, use judgement of command as “execute” and then repeat on next mob.
---
From there, i finish ret and ignore improved ret aura and Vindication. Floater point into parry.
---
The pve ret build ignores repentance and goes 11/11/29 to pickup conc, precision+kings and fleshes out ret. for leveling and world PvP I enjoy repentance.
---
Going 11 in holy allows you to instance tank somewhat if you can’t find a tank and avoid pushback on heals which is nice. It also adds reasonable dps in dungeons with cleave adds. 
---
Hope that helps.
---
Edit: I should note there are several ret paladin builds depending on gear and raid requirements. 11/11/29 is utilitarian and sacrifices 3% vengeance damage to take both conc and kings. Many standard ret pve builds forsake conc, to fully flesh ret out whilst maintaining kings.
---
Time. Lots and lots of playtime. As in, probably 10 hours a day of playtime
---
How do you get the font to be the one from Mass Effect?
---
Best game in the world. For years now....
---
I guess people always will have something negative to say....  nothing is perfect sorry man.
---
If you time vanish properly, you can stealth between the dot ticks and essentially reinitiate the fight. 
---
I'm not sure how much rogue you've played, but a dot does not mean you lose. During phase 1, any good rogue with cooldowns up can and should win any fair fight regardless of who initiated combat.
---
HotW / NS can heal and OT MC with proper gear sets, plus it isn’t too bad for pvp and farming.
---
No one likes tanking for pugs, that’s why there’s a shortage. 
---
Also no need to be swiftmend or moonglow when you don’t have all the dungeon gear you need yet, you’re just costing yourself a lot of time
---
I like but if I were to put my personal preference on it, I'd get that chat window unlocked and moved more left and down, text input box on top. Then I'd put map on bottom right. Keep all the elements low and the top clear and open.
---
Wait, are you the guy that was on the boat to Menethil telling everyone who we had to thank for the maritime services awhile back?
---
Considering the amount of "LF caster DPS arena/angerforge" I see, I'm clearly in the minority, but IMO it's not worth farming a low drop rate item that everyone wants.
---
If you spend 30 min forming or looking for a group and do 5 runs at 30 min each every time you go out there and it takes you 40 runs to get it that's 24 hours of farming BRD.
---
If you're unlucky like OP, you spend over 60 hours and still don't have it.
---
And both of those time estimates are *extremely* optimistic in terms of efficiency. In reality you're gonna deal with nobody wanting your class in those runs, people dropping after 1 clear, people wanting to kill other random bosses, people taking 15 minutes to move their ass out of IF, getting ganked on the way there, some retard jumping into the lava in the wrong spot, etc...
---
My rogue is sitting pretty with Blackhand's Breath and DM book trinket and I'm fine with that.
---
Go to azshara and grind mobs. There’s some mobs in the top right that drop felcloth.
---
Cuz he's full of shit.
---
Yeah if they only replaced the crazy niche grinds with dailies I wouldn't have minded.. but they didn't, they basically made the game "get to max level, do dailies for every single aspect of play".
---
I tried to come back for mists, hit max level and then looked at where I needed to go.. answer was "go do dailies for X, Y, Z". I lasted as long as it took me to hit honored and be rewarded with "Yay! As your reward, please double the number of quests you do".
---
Which is stupid because I'll happily jump online for an hour a day and stuff about doing whatever I need for whatever grind I'm doing and enjoy it, daily quests just don't work for me.
---
So basically I'm gonna play Classic through BC and Wrath and then when Wrath reaches "that point" I'll be out. I really really hope that they instead take a "Classic+" approach and actually make the game better in the right ways, but I'll take the old style if needed.
---
The dream is still performing adequately compared to the peers around you? ofc you'll never be a fury warrior on execute phase but it's still possible to top meters on onyxia with proper prep :)
---
&gt;and this is where we disagree. when it hits them in the wallet and pve server players don't re-up their subscriptions to farm mc for the next 6 months the pain will be felt on all servers
---
Not everyone quits, some might, some might reroll on a PvP server, some might take months just to get to 60.
---
&gt; maybe some saw it coming that pvp servers would have more content but that's not the players fault on pve servers that they didn't have a crystal ball
---
You don't need a crystal ball when the developers tell you exactly what's going to happen and what the future plan is with detailed breakdowns of the content.
---
I haven't played WoW in 15 years, when I started up again I looked at the server list and saw the content plan and realized that PvE servers would be boring as soon as you hit 60.
---
&gt;it's on blizzard to alter their plans and fix it.
---
Not really. Blizzard created the platform, the environment and the world, but you chose to play by a set of rules that would leave you bored at the end game until new content was released.
---
Shadowcraft set on Tauren is ridiculous
---
This is where the Rogue waits for the Mage to waste mana - and separates the ones who are using max rank Blizz/AE from the ones who use r1. Getting an opener for a Rogue is usually a given - but it's like a Warrior getting bad Rogues out of stealth with an obvious Demo Shout.
---
Shouldn't have rushed
---
I have blackhands breath and the green trinket that gives +8 to all resists.
---
"I doubt any other class has such an elegantly designed system, and I applaud Blizzard for their foresight in crafting a character that I can play with while playing with myself."
---
Time to reroll
---
exactly, I think its funny when someone loses in a duel and says it was unfair you used insert: elixir, potion, cooldown, etc.
---
Mulgore at night simply because how magical it is :)
---
Yeah sorry. Thus is 2nd post I seen congratulating someone on getting the weapon. So curiousity got to me thinking why is this a big deal. Read how the eye of sulfuras drops only from Ragnaros which I understand can only be done once a week. And it's a rare drop at that. And in the past I learned there's like 40 people who are needed to roll on this, what I don't understand is who would pass on this. Thus leading me to believe about 10-15 people will roll on this. And I also read that a raid leader is the only one who decides who gets what in a raid, and there was guys who would disband entire guilds just to ninja a rare drop. 
---
 Just seem like you have to go through so much to get this item. Like blacksmithing 300 and other quests. 
---
 It's alot of work, like shit people with lives do not have time for lol. Like I don't have 3+ hours to do one dungeon since being a 1st timer I can't see a veteran group taking me on and being like oh yeah let's give it to the newbie lol that would never happen with how.many try hards there is.
---
 ON top of that I read lots of posts who say they won a roll but the leader just said nah f you the other person gets it and that not even for something as rare as the eye of sulfuras.
---
When fighting trash I also throw in a Fire Blast since it does as much damage as Frostbolt. It just costs more Mana. On boss fights I'll cast Arcane Missiles during a Clearcasting proc. It's barely lower DPS than Frostbolt and takes the place of two of them for 0 Mana. Great for not going OOM on long fights.
---
Oh, I'm arcane instead of deep frost, though.
---
Yeah, you need 225 fishing to accept the quest from Nat Pagle in Dustwallow Marsh and since they are quest items you need the quest in your log to actually get them.
---
When you get to the specific spots, it takes about 2-10 minutes to catch the fish.
---
If you’re going for speed you gotta go for the second little jump cutting the corner of the dock once you’re already on the dock.
---
Awesome thank you!
---
Thanks!
---
You realize that's a very ironic thing to say right?
---
You need 225 fishing skill and level 35 just to pick up the quest.
---
Same for warlock
---
Reroll on pvp. You have time.
---
If a second person gets on the aggro table, you both die.
---
If you join a party with them you can solo kill the npc, then just have them loot the head. Only you are on the aggro table so it doesn't trigger the instagib.
---
I played a warrior in classic as a tank who sometimes dps. I tried the other way around to find that nearly everyone is a human warrior for +5 swords and rep cheese.
---
lol downvoted for that...hilarious.
---
Thanks so much. Have a new video coming out tomorrow with a little bit of a different style. Please sub if ya want to watch this weekend. I appreciate it :)
---
so you are agreeing with my post
---
Follow up. What makes so many of you come together to help one player ?? I was in a guild and I couldn't even get help with some quests nevermind something of this level.
---
Really? May b I ask how it is?
---
Not a lot of people know about the best emote, /golfclap 
---
“You clap for X, clearly unimpressed.”
---
And those groups exist, it's almost like there's room for several opinions in a crowd of millions.
---
did you really just refer to your experience with computer as "exp"?
---
Every single mc run I have done has had 10+ mages. It is not going to be possible to complete a t1 this phase for me. (Still have yet to win a roll but that’s what I get for a simple ms&gt;os /roll guild)
---
Shazz eu

Awesome! This makes a lot of sense, thank you for the inspiration :)
---
No fear on airships. lol. I don't know if you can get feared off the airship but I got dangerously close to it before the zone. Otherwise, no rules or restrictions.
---
Man this is exactly the kinda post I needed and I’ll be following you’re advice, thank you for taking the time to write this up.

We are an og vanilla guild from laughing skull EU, guild still active on retail...

DM East, lasher farming.
---
So chill, peaceful, and beautifully designed room.  
---
If I’m going to mindlessly farm, there’s not much of a better place.
---
I am not too sure how all the stats work, so what’s better for healing: a weapon with “+24 Healing Spells” or a weapon with “Equip: Increases healing done by spells and effects by up to 11”?
---
And, if possible, why?
---
Ran for like 40 mins to get to cow starting zone for this
---
Man I get that all the time, I think modern wow ruined these lil chickpeas...  I whisper about 30 people that I can literally see running around and playing near the instance, and I get maybe 1 reply, and it doesn't even make sense.
---
"Hey want to tank ZF real fast?  Have full group, you'd be the only plate wearer..." and 11 minutes later get a reply that says "What is a ZF?" or "Who are you?" like... dafuq?

I've seen people unironically do this with PvP flag enabled on top of flight masters in goblin towns.

Fortunately you can set a hotkey to interact with an NPC after /targeting them.

Got a pair of windreavers today and was wondering this myself. How long are these bis?
---
I just entered Westfall with my first character I honestly don't know yet, I am sorry.
---
Yeah that's fine, it's the thought that counts
---
Have you enabled TSM addon and checked.  In the TSM addon you can switch to the blizzard UI. Still at work currently. Yay long nights. Try that out and let me know.
---
Dude is dense af
---
Considering each fight has like two (at most) mechanics for each class, it's not hard to know them like the back of your hand
---
I wasn't saying that you would instantly die, I'm saying that relying on vanish is a fools errand.  
---
We weren't talking about fair fights we were talking about getting jumped while questing, this isn't dueling.  If you are out in the world just running around and get dot'd unawares you have lost the advantage.  It doesn't mean you are going to lose it just means you are fighting an uphill battle as the starting a fight from stealth is a major part of rogue mechanics.  And while yes you can vanish in-between dot ticks it doesn't mean you can close the distance without burning your sprint which you wouldn't want to do because then you have lost both of your movement impairment removal abilities within those 6 seconds.
---
I main a 60 rogue, while leveling I only lost fights to duos or groups while I was questing.  I fully understand what my class can and can't do.  I don't agree with you about being able to win against any class regardless of who initiated combat.  There are classes that are hard counters against rogues and completely take away their ability to close on them or stealth.  It's a loose rock paper scissors pvp system and rogues are good, but they aren't the top dog.
---
I didn't want anything to overlap... the bottom right is for my bags, and I have the DPS meter under my unitframe, and the SPY addon to the left of that.
---
I'll give it a shot, thank you!
---
Apes together strong
---
Wait. Horde put together kill groups? You can't even get alliance in the zone you are in to group to defend against horde.
---
Yeah that's my b I thought they were referring to his first comment in the thread
---
It's still no where near 60g an hour lol. 20-30 yes.
---
Then do it again on a pvp server
---
Haha the routine 30min morning shit after clocking in
---
Honestly content is so easy right now as long as you are in a guild that is not trying for realm first/world bosses they should be fine letting you play what you find fun. Plus who doesn’t want a moonkin guild mascot
---
Rogues. We have like 47 CDs. 510 openers, 109 combo point generators and about 69 finishers. :P 
---
 Don't forget all those sweet consumables and vanishes, blinds, distractions.
---
Taking an auction down is effectively buying it out yourself (or bidding an arbitrarily high value for it) - But, since you're the bidder and seller, no money has to trade hands, so you don't actually have to be able to afford it.
---
I did a run with 3 mages. Left me thinking im just there to pretend im doing something other than slow them down if they had even more mages.
---
Concur with the prior redditor, 0/30/21 is a *very* viable build for tank/resto.  With decent (read: pre-raid BIS type) gear, you can be an OT and switch to healing on fights where that is more important.
---
Hits too close to home. Took me near up to an hour to find an SM armory group as a tank prot paladin. I finally find a group and it was honestly the worst experience I've had on WoW classic so far. 
---
Seriously, some of you need to learn basic human etiquette.
---
Darnassus
---
All good my dude. 1-60 as a paladin is so enjoyable for me, the class fantasy and being competitive whilst being the unique alliance class is so much fun. Same with shaman. 
---
60 is very rigid however. But if you get 8/8 judgement and a good weapon you could hang up your raider boots and PvP as ret for a time.
---
Blackrock Mountain. That place is amazing, the dungeons and raids, the story behind it, the design and look of the interior, I mean that central room. It's absolutely amazing.
---
What server? Love the guild name.
---
He's saying youre just being a douche.
---
If you're gonna take all this time just name the guide or move along.
---
Eastern Plaguelands. I know it's weird but all the time I spent there 15years ago with my paladin, grabbing those last levels, doing some dungeons there, and later some pvp and farming at Tyr's hand just bring back some good memories.
---
The majority of complaints about mages that I've seen have come from tanks bitching about mages either not understanding or not giving a crap about threat, so you might need to revisit your theory.
---
Ngl biggest reason I didn’t roll Druid was having to play a Tauren again.
---
It's confusing that they're different phrasings, but "+x healing spells" and "increases healing done by spells and effects by up to x" have the exact same effect. So 24 &gt;11.
---
Huh, it must not be showing up. Does dominos cause issues with it?
---
Edit: dominos had that bar set to disable, which made the game freak out and lock out the default cat bar.
---
Who’s saying no changes?

Vanilla realm cap=2500. Half of them will probably fall off before Naxx, if not more, assuming a 50/50 pop and the playerbase has halved, that's 650 players per faction, so probably around 5 guilds and 10 guilds total on the server. Also, a lot of these realms are skewed towards 1 faction, and looking at retail, a 15 year old experiment, we know that faction balance only gets worse until 1 faction dies off completely.
---
Yes. I wasn't disagreeing just adding to it.
---
Maybe there is a degree of just not playing very well.
---
I have tried to get into PvP, I just can't get it down. Maybe eventually I can try it again.
---
Please don't give people incorrect advice.
---
Word, I play via hotspot (4G) and get 40-50 ping (EU servers)
---
Yes, you can do this for sure. I think you can do it in one click since stance change is off the global cooldown. Not sure how to write it though. I have a macro that lets me intercept from battle stance and charge from berserker stance and I'm trying to remember if I actually hit it twice without thinking about it or it just fires when I click it.
---
I think it's the latter.  My guild is gearing up to go in the next few weeks, i'm in 75% pre-raid BIS and bc I never did this in vanilla, I'm definitely not confident in my readiness.
---
Just so you know... there is a golden samsam in camera and I will be amazed if you find it.
---
First, let me say the neck is incredibly good. Arguably it's the best threat necklace in the game, even moreso for fury/prot that loves crit.
---
That said, the trinket is also not as bad as almost every post here seems to suggest. Defense is a great stat. Parry is also lovely, which is a great tank mitigation stat on account of the haste rating it gives you. However, the unsung aspect of the trinket, and what made me choose it as a tank also, is its fire resist. There is no other defensive trinket in all of vanilla WoW with fire resist on it.
---
This means that for the following fights, that trinket is one of the best trinks to have IMO:
---
Baron Geddon (MC)
---
Ragnaros (MC)
---
Onyxia
---
Literally every boss in BWL
---
Four Horsemen front row tanking
---
In particular the fact that I still on a private server found myself using the ony trinket when tanking mograine in four horse was enough to make me take it in classic too.
---
Never spam rejuvs, always just spam rank 4 or 3 HT depending on your +healing. Rejuvs are saved for when shit hits the fan.
---
When you wait 30 minutes as a healer, a DPS waits probably around 2-3 hours. If I had to wait 3 hours I'd swap immediately. I would've been able to level a new 60 before I got HoJ on that realm. Also, I'd imagine that half of the population drops off before Naxxramas, and knowing Blizzard they won't care enough to merge your realm with another until you've begged for it for 8 months straight, and that will cause even more people to leave. I've experienced similar things first hand way too many times. If some people start to jump ship, the majority will do the same. If there's noone to show your fancy raidloot to, your achievement becomes pointless and at that point you're just playing a glorified singleplayer game.
---
A feral tank with MCP handles threat fine on Vael.
---
I turn my all the way down when I farm herbs, I get panicked when I can’t find it and see another player in the distance look like they running my way lol.
---
Not to be a negative nancy but situps and pushups won't help you lose weight short term they'll just increase your metabolism over the long term as muscles eat a ton of calories. You certainly didn't lose 20 pounds from doing situps, squats and pushups in a month. Don't get me wrong it certainly helps but that's more long term. You lost that 20 pounds because you have a calorie deficit in your diet due to cardio or eating better or both.

Backstory: This happened on US-Kromkrush, where Alliance guilds Eminent, Welcome, and The Boys (among some extras) laid a trap for the top Horde guild Jealousy Noted on their way to raid Molten Core.
---
Or you can get two rogues plus any druid with a healing set for a simpler run with loot split one more direction. Farmed this the day I hit 60 in crap gear.
---
Nah, they're just too thick... like a blockbuster sign

I ran by someone yesterday in the hinterlands looking for griffons to kill for the feather quest. Got a random tell from a dude nearby saying “i hope your mother dies tonight” and i responded “??” And i was blocked. I dunno who pissed that guy off but it wasn’t me.
---
It would be fine to take it down if it has no active bids on it from any players, but once someone else bids on it,  you shouldn't beable to take it down. Else there's is no punishment to putting the item up for a stupidly low bid and an above average buyout so it shows up first on the AH UI. So the main way to fix these problems it to list by lowest buyout first (maybe as an option like a lot of AH addons have), what I proposed earlier (no auction takedown after a bid is made), or both.
---
The rez, innervate, 3% crit bonus, etc....do not do enough to justify bringing them over literally any other dps class.  More importantly, a feral dps druid would be a better choice over a oomkin druid.
---
I mean, druids have 2 good builds, 1 viable-ish dps build and people keep insisting on bringing the caster dps build that is a meme.
---
These kids a pussies, man. We aren’t even endorsing this dudes behavior, we’re simply saying there’s no need to clutch your pearls and get so worked up over it, guys.  I wouldn’t take offense to it, I would keep poking there bear to see him sperg out even more, and I’d have a laugh. Oh no, someone on the internet told me I should kill myself? Oh Lordy how will I ever survive!?

---
The player/target frames can be unlocked without a mod, it's an option when you right click them. But for action bars I think you'll need a mod like bartender or dominos.
---
Edit: Actually I just downloaded the retail version of MoveAnything (https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/move-anything) and installed it in the Classic Addon folder and it appears to work. It's not an addon I used/am familiar with so I didn't test it thoroughly but I was able to move bars and such around and had no errors. I would give it a go.
---
It's a world drop, you could find it anywhere you find a green drop basically.
---
Don't bother farming it unless you have prayed to RNGesus, just buy it from the AH if you can.
---
The gankfest returns now that layers are off. How bad will phase 2 be for leveling?
---
Tank warriors use all 3 stances with various macros to quickly enter each one with differing weapon swaps. Or you can just spam sunder armor, which is not that far from optimal
---
Yes. RFK, BFD, RFD, SFK, RFC.. GIVE US SOME VARIETY!

response is still good. OTHER people will find the thread by googling that very question and the guy's response will help them
---
no reason to be smug douchebag and tell people how to use a message board "properly"
---
damn i would love to kill anyone with that guild name lol
---
Find a solid guild quick. Knowing what happened to retail WoW starting in vanilla until now, your realm's pop will drastically decrease once the influx of transfer players stop comming, and the best you can hope for is a realm merge in the future. The ones who transfer just to play the game are definitely less invested than the ones who happily sit in queues for hours, and thus also way more likely to quit.
---
Yeah why do people skip her? She drops a staff that vendors for a fair amount and there's only like 1 trash pull to clear on the way.

---
Thank you!

Oh, those disgusting good guilds on alliance. I mean there’s so many of them, though. Which ones? Which ones are the very good ones?
---
I've never quested in Vietnam, is that a new zone?
---
Same amount either way, if you can get the pet you want at a higher level, do that and save yourself leveling it.
---
How do you do the reset of the dungeon?  Take off gear and die and run back?
---
That’s only 5% of your daily value...
---
Bloodsail Buccaneers.
---
It is viable. But, it's not the most efficient by far. Think of any old school Korean grinder, such as Silk Road Online, Shaiya, or Last Chaos. You basically had 1 quest every few levels. WoW changed that by using the dungeon method (with loot). Quests are the MOST efficient means of leveling. You break that monotony by going into dungeons at the -proper- times. But, again, you get 4-7 quests and with one dungeon run you get 50-100% exp.
---
Yes, killing 1,500 turtles is a good way to space out, grind exp, and make a little cash. But, it's not the best way, which is what he was asking.
---
You're not getting it. The lower level guys get diminished xp from the high level toon. But then they get group exp bonus. The. Because their fighting elites that exp is boosted a little more. And then even though they're getting less exp per kill. Because the high level toon can kill way way faster. They will level much faster than if running it without said high level toon.
---
I've already passed the zones I can level it in while questing. The average herb I see is over 100 and I'm at 92
---
Should be 3.5 - 4 hours at that lvl
---
This has been an issue forever. Back in vanilla eventually most of our Druids  quit or rerolled and would have to constantly recruit. Fresh Druids gear up insanely fast and get bored and quit. I recall one quitting and giving it to the guild master so we could have MoTW for our raids.
---
Just looted the Princess Mace, shall i use it for now or look for Destiny anyway?

I work with laws and regulations. My degree got me in the door and my skills got me some promotions.

My best score so far was at the Booty Bay AH. Noticed a stack of 2x Essence of Earth for like 2s buyout. I suspect someone was trying to move them cross faction perhaps? Needless to say, I immediately clicked buy and re-sold them for 30g.

2s to 30g, not bad.

Aww ye. Gehennas has turned into a complete shitfest, but I've assumed that the kind of people responsible would appear on any server. If that isn't the case I might seriously consider transfering
---
I'm sorry.
---
Yeah, folks with special character names ain’t getting invites or mail unless I can just click your name from chat.
---
Nice try
---
To me stv is a zone that you visit on 3 separate occasions, at levels 30 35 and 40. But even then I don't usually do every quest in the zone.
---
Yah that's your graphics card
---
You have only 3 slots, and I keep one slot open while leveling to gain new skills (which you learn from certain other wild animals). For instances, I'll often bring a wolf for the howl buff or an owl for the screech, but cats and boars are still really good pets. 
---
I love boars solo, picking through targets one at a time - especially when it can use dash and charge. Send it and it'll be biting a mob for a while, building threat while I loot and skin the previous mob. Eats anything, tanky as hell.
---
Bookmark petopia and go have fun. The best thing about hunters is they can have all sorts of pets. Don't just play the "optimal".

What do you expect? Its an Alienware lol

---
Yeah I mean at the end of the day, play how you want. 
---
But I will deliberately avoid inviting mages if I can. Except fire mages. I grouped with one a while back and watching mobs health drop by chunks with each fireball was enjoyable.
---
Boomkins get a free pass to my groups, same with ele shamans and shadow priests. I also ensure that all my groups have a nice balance of cloth/leather/mail/plate wearers. The more off-meta your spec is, the more likely I am to invite you. If everyone was a mage/warrior/priest, the game would be boring to me.
---
I guess what I'm saying is, if you're Horde on Fairbanks, feel free to make the most unorthodox spec you want, I will not only support your decision, I'll actively encourage and assist you in any way I can.

I don't want to say this is pathetic. This is sad.

MINING QUESTION
---
Do I need to visit any trainers to level up mining as I go - to progress to higher mining levels, or can I freely mine myself up to maximum level
---
If you're just dueling for fun, there are no rules. But if you hang around to duel a lot, often 5-10 in a row with the same opponent, this is generally my ruleset:
---
- Warriors get to charge
---
- Rogues get to stealth obviously, but are not guaranteed an opener
---
- No cooldowns over 10 minutes, that includes abilities or items
---
- Consumables are weird if it's asymmetrical, so either all or nothing
---
- Any buffs that are short duration (shadow prot, ice barrier, etc) all must be cast within the 3-2-1-go. In other words, I can't stack PW:S, renew, Shadow prot, then click duel and expect you to accept it immediately so I can start the duel perfectly
---
BLOW ME GANG!! Best server for sure
---
Yes, you can transfer any and everything to the same server at the same time. Even your lvl 1 bank alts.
---
This, plus you'll want the highest level of skills so taming as high as you can is always best.
---
Z Perl looks nothing like it. Unless it’s a different skin he uses. 
---
Maybes it’s Luna unit frames?
---
And in raid we only spam garrote, sinister strike, slice and dice, evi and pop some cd sometimes..
---
Mara princess runs (35-45g per hour, depending on whether you have mining / herbalism or not, potential for more gold if you can sell boosts for the ring). 
---
Some stuff in DM:N but I think Mara is better gold per hour. 
---
Apart from those, your best option is probably open world farming (Felwood, gathering profession farms, etc).

It's a tank 1hander
---
You need to train at a trainer to smelt new ore, but you can mine it as soon as you hit the minimum skill.
---
If it was an all guild run, maybe, if it was a pug group except for you and your friend (maybe if you were the only two to roll need?), they almost certainly won't let the item go to you. The reason you can't trade like you can is raids is to prevent people friends from rolling on it then just trading it over when numbers prevail over the people that should actually be rolling on it.
---
It has like +12 Stam and a defence/armour CoH
---
It’s a 1h sword with 2.00 speed so best for tanks
---
As an arms warr you want slow 2h with high weapon damage so no it’s not good for you
---
Druids are always in demand, simply because they aren’t played much.
---
Not to mention people realizing that Bears are very strong, arguably better than Warrior tanks in P1.
---
1. Druids have more fun than any other class out in the actual world.
---
2. In PvP with engineering, they literally have 0 counterpicks.
---
Bloodfang and earthshaker are 50/50 while you're fucked on every major PvP realm as alliance. Have fun being farmed as Alliance after being in queues for hours in p2.
---
Princess Mace isnt bad, the problem with it is is honestly that its a mace and mace spec is not good lol  
---
So its up to you, see if you like the damage you get from it after you level up the skill. Id still say buy up Destiny and use it at 52. Its really too good to pass up and it lasts you until 60.
---
I separated out my guild chat into a new window. Does anyone know how to make it so that the guild chat window gets highlighted whenever someone says/messages in guild chat?
---
Most guilds will want the tanks equipped with Might before gearing up the DPS warriors.
---
It's not really 'fair' in the general sense, but because equipping tanks essentially increases overall ability of the entire raid it's considered the optimal thing to do.
---
Phase 2 will encourage more ganking from leveling players but most are already done with that part by then.
---
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
If I don't know you, your sex, your age or whether or not you're an asshole, I call you bud, or would bruh be more to your liking? I feel the same way about people who call you 'friend' when they definitely aren't being friendly. 
---
How do you address someone casually when you know literally nothing about them other than your initial interaction?
---
U can look up the stats on Wowhead. It’s a tanking sword that can be used with fury DPS but not really arms because arms focuses on 2h weapons
---
Boat guy, you are the best local celebrity.

Ouch, that’s a lot of people to owe gold to.

I was trying to make a joke about how many different species of deadly plants and animals can be found in Australia.

---
Some people did that in Vanilla!
---
Classic &gt; retail always because if they made they changes they need to improve the game they’d lose their base and can’t risk it
---
the weapon usually goes to an enhancement shaman who will use it most effectively in a raid or pvp. and the WoW community never ceases to amaze in the structure and support people bring to OTHER guilds in helping complete the weapon. it is a legendary, it is not something everyone will get there hands on. if it means helping someone fulfill something that many wont then so be it. if noone got help in the making of it and everyone was selfish and wanted it for them selves, we wouldnt see the weapon for months. its a big accomplishment and something to be proud of for being part of the making, EVEN IF YOU DONT OWN IT.
---
Make another warrior but with a slightly different spec.

This video breaks down the mechanics quite well [https://youtu.be/5mSyDW11K68](https://youtu.be/5mSyDW11K68)

In PvE at least, the Paladin is an aoe farm bot.  They became genuinely, obscenely overpowered in later xpacks, (ESPECIALLY WoTLK) but in Classic, they're primarily a free mount and the ability to rapidly aoe harvest leather or cloth, thanks to Consecrate.
---
While you will be permitted to tank in 5 mans, the raid elitist meta regarding Paladins is Holy (healing) or GTFO, due to the facts that:-
---
a}  Ret is the butt of as many jokes as a Balance Druid.
---
b}  Prot has no taunt or genuine aggro transfer, unlike the Warrior.
---
c}  Consecrate works via the Holy damage type, and some bosses are apparently Holy immune.
---
They do have some nice buffs with the auras and Blessing of Kings, and AFAIK they're also considered solid healers.  But if you're planning to raid, then unless you like the idea of a healer who can theoretically wear plate armour, (but mostly won't, because the stat bonuses are primarily in cloth for healers) then I wouldn't bother.
---
With the hybrids in general, the first question that needs to be asked is whether you intend to raid.  If you don't, then by all means, roll and level a hybrid and have fun.  
---
If you do want to raid, then don't roll a hybrid.  It's basically that simple.  Raiding is similar to real life employment, in the sense that it is a scenario where the player's will is not their own.  The min-maxing, elitist sociopaths are in charge, and you either do what they decree, or they don't choose you for raid groups; and they don't want hybrids.  They generally only want Warriors, Priests, Mages, or Rogues.
---
I am levelling a Druid because I care more about making friends, having informal fun, and participating in the economy than raiding as such; but I don't have any illusions about ever being invited to a raid group.  
---
My main is a tanking Warrior, and even though I possibly could participate in raids with that class, I have no intention of doing so.  Even in five mans, I've seriously felt myself moving closer to a nervous breakdown while tanking, due to the degree to which DPS disregard my direction of the group, and generally view me with contempt.
---
Happy Cake day!
---
That is nice. And stuff like this would only encourage comradery. I'd help people over and over if it meant I could get help getting my bis staff.

Female dwarf rogue T1, or anything dwarf rogue female

I've heard that reset time doesn't always coincide with raid reset time these days. Might be an urban legend though.
---
Yeah hoping onto the fountains in the GY and chilling for a minute will reset mobs over there as well.

It's Luna, yes.

As someone who has played WoW since 2005, I can't recommend retail at all. If you haven't played BFA at all you'll probably get a good month of fun out of it. Eventually you'll start to understand how pointless everything and how soulless the game feels, and you'll stop playing.
---
If it wasn't for classic, I wouldn't even have the Blizz launcher installed on my PC any more. I know everyone has different tastes, but classic IMO is leagues better than retail simply because your progress matters and the game is fun.
---
I highly doubt blizzard won't update classic servers to BC. Classic launch along was HUGE, and even if the players fell of dramatically since then, that first month of sails had to have made Blizzard a buttload of cash. They've already stated that now that 1.12 has been rebuilt, the hardest part of remaking classic is done. Making BC will take significantly less work.
---
I'll add that even though I hate BFA, if you've never played it then at least give it a shot and see if you like it. For $15 a month, even if you play it for a solid month straight, you'll get a lot out of it. Just don't expect to be thrilled with endgame and the state of the game once you start to run out of new things to do.
---
Classic was a decade ago lmfao
---
I hit 60 two days ago. I'm not sure I am up for dungeon grinds, so I'm seriously considering leveling another toon
---
They're fun and good tanks.
---
typically you help someone, you get helped in return, there is always bad selfish apples on every gaming platform. but mostly in WoW in a guild your favours dont go unnoticed. best advice i can give is just keep contributing and helping and being a friendly supportive member of your community building ur rep, and ur time will come
---
i barely ran anger like maybe 10 times it dropped more than half lol
---
Sounds like this is definitely a bug right now.
---
I have no idea either 
---
I hope so. Got tricked into playing on a pvp server. Need to get off it
---
I’ve bought so many things for 1 copper that if I’d list them, people would say that I’m lying. This is mainly how I got my mount at lvl 40. Besides selling vendor recipes on the AH.
---
Yeah so your alt does the resetting and you have run all the way out of the dungeon physically on your main?  I'll check out the other video when I get on my desktop
---
Hahaha if you re-read the title with that in mind, it does sound kind of like a threat! Amazing
---
Feralas. It's incredibly soothing to me and I always make sure to spend as much time as possible there on every character, be it questing, grinding or fishing.

Tauren can only ride kodos and wolves but you need to grind the org rep. They can also technically ride Baron's mount but that's a drop and not tied to a race.

Skipping a lot of training, not leveling crafting, avoid buying from the AH and the bank gets a fire sale.

I saw a post like this in the past but thought they were pretty off. I think you can argue for a few classes not belonging were they are necessarily but if they cant stack on the same space I'd say this is pretty close

It is not about when you receive the fist that matters, it's about how well you put the fist to use.

Go forth and fist the horde, fist your enemies and perhaps even your fist allies. Fist until you can't fist anymore! Fist until they lie defeated and bloody! Fist like you've never fisted before! TO THE HEAVENS! FIST WAY, BRAVE OGHAM! FIST AWAAAY!

Almost nobody knows you're getting carried though...  It's like pissing in the shower vs pissing in the middle of a crowded street.

They're talking about cancelling an auction that has a bidder, in which case you not only lose the deposit but also an extra 5%.

I've yet to meet a stable minded warr and every shaman is chill af
---
You didn't read what I said, I used to buff every person up until about lvl 30 as well as hand out mage food/water to save them gold, now though it is taking far too much mana and I need to stop and drink, can't spend my own time drinking for 20+sec after every second buff when 95% of people don't even notice you buff them
---
I'm dedicated to healing only in leather. still have 430 +healing and 6600 mana buffed (1/29/21) in just pre-BIS without the healing enchant
---
no dresses for this druid
---
No rules duels literally just means that if there's a good rogue, noone can ever win against him thanks to their own skill, just him fucking up majorly, making it pointless to duel rogues. Same goes for any other class vs a warlock or a shadowpriest. Having no ruleset just makes it certain that you didn't win due to your skill vs one of these specs, you simply got lucky.
---
Be respectful in victory and defeat.
---
That is the only one which matters. Duels aren't real pvp, they are at best an imitation of it, and the person you are fighting is just a sparring partner.
---
So have fun with it in the way you find it fun, as there is so much more to get out of a duel than simply winning the duel.
---
It can't be done naked as you need to wear boots with the speed enchant at the very least huehue
---
Ironforge, even though I play horde now I’ve always loved ironforge and prefer it way more than stormwind
---
You’ll be downvoted but this is the truth. HoJ is amazing and this thread is full of noobs.

That guild name though
---
Don’t need that even, but it helps ;)
---
Reached 50g/hr with [this version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPy2Uroiwh4).
---
My thinking was that all warriors follow some code or the law of a faction etc. And shaman was a tough one that's why they were at least neutral. I definitely didn't think any of the top 6 deserved to be in evil.
---
Iron Forge!
---
I'm a 48 horde warrior and I swapped over to executioner cleaver. Granted there's no spam on it but it has 1% hit. 
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?item=13018](https://classicdb.ch/?item=13018)
---
And other day when i said unwrittem rule of duels are no pots and other consumables, but eng granades are allowed i got downvoted to hell.
---
Kind of cringe.
---
Shadoweave set is the 1sy real shadow damage gear i saw that made significant difference
---
How do you solo noxxion for the scepter quest? He has been hitting super hard, been too many adds to kill.
---
They spawn on the island, but it's only two of the like five types of naga who spawn on that island.
---
Hit is not by far the best dps stat. In fact it is the 3rd best stat. Extra change to swing &gt; crit &gt; hit.
---
You'd have to get specific with specializations for this to be totally accurate but it's good enough
---
So if you're not performing at max efficiency, it's selfish?
---
Everyone in the raid must have full BiS and full consumes, full pots and flasks, 100% uptime on buffs.
---
Don't be selfish.
---
Only an alliance (scum) player would think shamans are evil.
---
Hear me out on this one. I feel like rogue and lock should be flipped. Rogues get a bad wrap because they work in the shadows sure, but they can also abide by a code. Like the SI7 giving them a law attribute. Where warlocks are just batshit crazy summoning daemons and crap. Their main hangout is an actual underground lair...
---
Edit: and this is totally because I “don’t” play a rogue.
---
As soon as i see a warlock at 50% mana i'll drop a renew, i expect to see them use that to regenerate mana asap. if i see a warlock wand even once i'll be right on them asking why.
---
Horde
---
I don’t think shamans are evil, but I don’t know who else would fit that slot. Other then that it’s pretty accurate.
---
Hit is better. Keep resist trink for FR.
---
The correct answer is the damn defend the wrecked ship from Naga in Azshara, that rewards 600 xp and has no follow up because whatever it was supposed to be part of was never implemented.
---
No, it's selfish to take a DPS spot while you are *objectively* doing less DPS than a tank.
---
Just do that quest with a normal group. It’s worth the time it takes.
---
thank you
---
Gotta start a pay it forward group.  
---
Everyone has to farm two.  One for themselves, and one for one person after they get it.  
---
That's basically how we did it in my guild with our run.  Also did helped people with bad luck get Satyr's bow this way too.
---
I'm convinced ironfoe isn't in the game I have never even seen one equipped let alone drop in my runs.
---
Yeah I'm seeing a lot more posts about it now. I'm still only level 54 so I have a few more days before I have to worry about it ;)
---
Grind dungeons.  Sell any BOE blues you are (unwisely) holding onto til BG drops.  Sell them lower than the AH.
---
I don't have to walk out. I actually get put at the start since its reset. Its like a new dungeon. It saves a ton of time.
---
Ah yes Druids. Masters on None.
---
Can be done as a fresh 60, rotgrip as well if you know the path to kite him.
---
Ive gotten many whispers saying “wanna Mc/Ony?  No druids in our raid right now”.
---
There aren’t many slots, but there aren’t many druids.
---
I thought of Warlocks as Lawful because they enslave demons and have like a contract with them of sorts. Rogues didn't really scream lawful to me I feel like a rogue is out for themselves and doesn't listen to rules
---
Swap hunter with shaman and nailed it
---
Per weapon right? So you'd do (20/14)*1.75 for offhand damage.
---
i just found this post here because i have the same "bug" and it annoys the fk out of me.. so i asked the last guy i traded if he has elvui or tsm and he also had none of it (me neither btw), so it has to be something else.
---
but 1 thing i noticed is, that it happens more when the city is crowded in peak hours. i almost never have that issue late late night or early morning when OG is almost empty
---
I would consider rogues to be more neutral evil and warlocks chaotic evil. I would also put druids at true neutral, shamans at chaotic good, and hunters as lawful evil.
---
That could be done but the 9 classes fits perfectly with the nine positions possible
---
They do have the shark, though.
---
Level 47 horde rogue here and I never mess with lowbies, but the alliance on my server (whitemane) throughout most of my leveling experience have ganked me any chance they get. I'm talking ?? Levels. I'll be minding my own business and they'll stop dead in their tracks, pull a full 180 and knock my dick in the dirt. Shit I even helped a lowbie dwarf hunter with an escort quest the other day because there's no fun in killing someone that doesnt stand a chance
---
&gt;If you kill me I will whine and call for backup and it probably won’t come. But if it does, believe we will Teabag your corpse

In defense of the Rogue class, it ***is*** occasionally played by decent, non-sociopathic human beings.  
---
Yes, the class's mechanics are specifically designed to cater to Bartle's Killer player archetype; but that is only really in PvP.  On Normal servers you can find Rogues being played by plenty of perfectly nice people, who simply like being able to maximise their DPS, and do stealth farming runs in instances, in order to make money.
---
As a tanking Warrior main, while I consider bad Rogues to be the bane of my existence, a good Rogue is a unique blessing.  
---
*  They will generally be able to offtank casters, which frees me to only need to focus on melee mobs, which is very beneficial since a Protection Warrior has little aoe ability.  It is possible to cycle targets with a Warrior, yes; but our only aoe taunt is on a ten minute cooldown, and Thunderclap is in Battle Stance.
---
*  They have arguably the highest melee damage output in the game.  In 5 mans at least, the time difference to completion can be close to 50%, between having and not having a Rogue present.  This also massively increases the survivability of my group, which is my main priority.

Hunting lotus is my favorite thing to do idk

Its def all about when  you get it.

If you get that at level 20 horde just loose.

run through the charred vale for about 5-6 hours mining every node you find.

Go to Desolace and talk with the troll on the dock. He'll want you to get five crawfish from the traps below the dock. Turning five in will get you fifty-five silver, and you can do it as much as you want.

I prefer to put people in the dirt than die... to each their own.

A few things.

Hunter needs to be CN as they are easily the most Chaotic Stupid class hands down.
---
War should probably be TN.

Shaman is Lawful Neutral as they are beholden to the whims of the elements 100%
---
This is really quite a hard one to match up and I can see this topic blowing the fuck up quick.
---
hey, with that setup you were able to maintank 9/10? :) 4100 hp, +33 deff 6370 arm ? :)
---
Biggest problem with this is to find a group that's only going to do angerforge and no one needs the only good item that drops. Sure if you were going to do Arena + Angerforge + Golemlord then your odds increase, but golemlord is only for the healer, so finding a tank and 2 dps to come just for the arena boss is super unlikely. If you're doing a full clear and you're the only one that needs it then you're spending hours longer per kill so the odds are worse than just 5 runs / hour.
---
Realms like gehennas are tilted towards horde, but still have several times the alliance players compared to any of the realms you can transfer to. Gehennas is the third realm I'm leveling to 60 on, this time around I'm alliance and even though I'm way behind the pack now, and the past 2 realms were both "full" realms, gehennas is far more lively than the other realms I played on. Noggenfogger is 75% horde and horde on there is less lively than alliance on gehennas which makes up 25% of gehennas

How does one join the Kul Tiran MC?

Brah let's talk about that. I left my last guild cause I helped lower levels and others with sooooo much shit but when I log on and ask ?  Met with silence.  Reason I left. This new guild I just found is already going to help me with sunken temple tomorrow so I'm optimistic.

Well, you read (present tense) that wrong. It's just a word I use when talking to people, friends, or otherwise.

I once spared a pally who I could have easily killed.   I was more interested in the node behind him.

Rather than heal himself up and fuck off, he tried to tap the node.  It was a poorly devised plan on his part.  I one shot him.

Never get between a warrior and his node

No I was modifying the six fingered man scene from princess bride.

Adding to what most people have said already. Blizzard whispers are a different color than player whispers by default. So unless you changed  the colors of chat text it should be easily recognisable that it was sent by another player

Got 10g yesterday just from linen and wool and I’m level 20

So.... you rushed to 60 with a bunch of other try hards and are now crying about the situation that you, and solely you, have put yourself into?  Maybe you should have uninstalled questie, read the quest texts, immersed yourself into the WORLD of warcraft, and generally enjoyed the leveling process.  You were probably one LFG spamming "LFM SPELLCLEAVE &lt;instance&gt;" and now look at you.... whining about how you have nothing to do.
---
I feel sorry for you.  And I don't mean because you have to wait a few months for the next phase lol.
---
Yep, the link hewwitt posted will explain how you do it well.
---
Maybe give a 5 minute grace period for "oh shit that wasn't the price I meant oh shit oh shit" moments.  Just my two copper.
---
This is what you get for choosing a pve server. You picked easy mode and now you have nothing left to do. If you want something more difficult just reroll.

Did this one the other day. Flask of wisdom trivialized all of the demons except the winterspring one (damn wandering pats). 1 shot the other 3, though I spent a small fortune on consumables.

So all my friends and I agreed to transfer to bloodfang a few hours ago... All their transfers went through fine. So I try my transfer and bloodfang is no longer a realm option for me. I was literally 20mins behind them. Do you think blizzard will help me out of this situation?

Classic is great

But it will get boring. Them taking so long to come out with BGs is killing it for me

Animal abuse and they like to agro stuff then fd leaving anyone else theyre with at the mercy of what theyre fighting

Smolderweb horde checking in. F u too Alliance.
---
There are those who have 1 duel a week.  but those who sit in IF / Org gates and duel non stop would use shitton on gold on pots. why do you want to waste gold on pots  if both can agree not to use them ? others notice that and also starts dueling without them. and soon everyone who constantly dueled knew, without asking beforehand to not use pots. thats how it became unwritten rule of dueling more then 10 years ago.  
---
Im alchemist and i feel sad for anyone who uses pots in duels. but go ahead kids. make me money always buying them.
---
Has to be The Crossroads. Such great memories about that place when I first started there in vanilla. Horde vs Alliance raids while I was just a lvl 15 tauren warrior with a bow and subpar gear, trying to do my part in the battles!
---
Bossfights are 1 minute long
---
Depends on the dungeon, but in general it's harder than filling in any other ~~class~~role.
---
Same here and talking to shamans from other guilds no ones seen it either.
---
Ive never seen one in game on anyone. I'm legitimately starting to think blizzard forgot to put it in
---
&gt;  "...whatever stupid neckbeard lingo you choose as your default then I would definitely think of you as what you obviously would appear to be."
---
OK, then.
---
Yeah but is there a rule saying multiple specs can't share the same allignment?
---
Alliance? Yup
---
Leave the guild. I did a few days ago and I’m having so much fun, getting great gear and levelled up so quick doing dungeons with the same Guildies :))
---
Really? It seems so big. I tried to go there back 8n vanilla cause I thought that it was neutral cause of jaina in wc3 lol.
---
Maybe when new content releases. Leather workers who got the recipe for hide of the wild the day of dire maul release would have made quite the hay day. Tailoring maybe has the same in later phases?
---
&gt; Unless you are an aoe farming mage questing or in some cases aoe dungeon groups are always better than grinding.
---
As someone who has almost exclusively levelled a tanking Warrior to level 45 in instances, I disagree with this.
---
When I am soloing mobs, I might be killing them relatively slowly, yes; but I am still killing SOME, which means I am getting SOME experience.  When, on the other hand, I am vegetating next to an instance's meeting stone for an hour or more while waiting for the rest of my group to fly to Uldaman from Tanaris, and go on bio and coffee breaks while doing so, I am getting ZERO experience, because I am doing NOTHING at all.
---
Five mans occupy a lot of time before going into the instance itself, where you do virtually nothing.  You first have to spend anywhere between 15 and 60 minutes finding the people to make up the group; and you then will often spend close to the same amount of time again, waiting for them to travel from their current location to the instance.
---
This means that even if you're solo levelling a Holy Priest and do nothing but grinding mobs, you are still going to have a potential maximum of two hours more time per instance, to grind and receive experience; which again means that even if you're doing it very slowly, you're still getting SOMETHING.
---
im the lock who goes for it because i only want pvp gear. most my locks are only rolling on raid upgrades where as im just trying to beef up for phase 2. were already clearing mc and ony so fast whats the point lol

Not trying to be a gatekeeper here but 10 is prob closer to average. Frost has been playing about 16 a day since launch.

[I asked something like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dc1m6f/how_do_i_get_shadowed_unit_frames_addon_to_do) a few weeks ago and got no response. 
---
It's a real bummer that this isnt included in the game and that it's either impossible to do or just Super difficult to find a way. But it just seems so simple. I feel like I would be a *better* healer if I could actually see my heals on the targetted character and not just their portrait.
---
Now level 60, since my last time posting that, and I've gotten used to it... but man, my god would be so much more favorable if the number would appear over their head like damage numbers do.
---
Thanks! Appreciate that.
---
Anything gnome-wise is goofy.
---
These are the reasons I roll on a PvP server.
---
Maybe I'll see you around on my alt Backattack
---
My rule says so
---
If a boss takes 1 minute longer to kill, that means 39 people waste 39 minutes. Do this for 10 bosses and that is 390 minutes. That is 6.5 hrs of other player's game time from 10 bosses. If you consider it as robbing time from other players, playing a flavour spec COULD be selfish.
---
Typically most try hard guilds have a "loot council" which is just code mainly for "the class leaders/officers decide that they get the best drops over 'members/raiders'".  Also, I thought Asmon (popular US douche streamer) already got both legendaries out of MC already - his stupid ass videos started popping up in my youtube feed.
---
Literally click on the word loot. It will bring up the default loot history UI for you
---
Or Dire Maul with mana burn and aggro resets. Total aids as a Paladin tank to deal with.
---
Yeah we did that once before, you don't even need 10-20, 5 will do just fine.
---
We all ressed at the same time and dropped a sapper, we didn't kill all of them but we got damn close.
---
I coin them Fury Rogues
---
&gt;***But if*** you were to add "bud" or "bruh" or whatever stupid neckbeard lingo
---
Reading comprehension isn't your strong suit.
---
That does not sound good... I can't face leveling again! Hopefully something can be done.. do they even warn people when the realm transfer windows are closing? I did not notice anything posted what a shitty situation!
---
Thanks for the reply
---
Everything is hunter loot!  *clicks need*

If you want no responsibility when running a dungeon, rogue is the choice and its not even close.

Barbarous blade is better than lok’delar for damage.

Who do you kill besides pyromancer and ribbly?

This guy is made of money

I see, thanks for the info.

You have to train once every 75 levels or so, like most gathering professions.

I dunno for sure if 2% Crit is better than 60 ap, but I was led to believe 2% Crit is fucking huge. 🤷‍♂️
---
to add to my comment. There also was guy who game me 20g so i can get my first mount just like that. I like that hord are littlebit more then allys (im ally)  cheking warcarflogs seems also there are few elite guild in ally side (progress / MAXIMA )  and i trully havent had toxic expirience. Maybe i just got thick skin from LOL and dont even notice that but i dont think that the case.
---
As I said before, have a good one.
---
Get your four friends and you.
---
Unequip all your gear.
---
Go to the Auction House. Spend 50 gold each, maximum, to gear yourself.

The run Strat (both sides), Scholo, Dire Maul.

If you want this on EZ-Mode, you're allowed to equp drops.
---
&gt; 18 dps in SFK? Useless. 21 tank in BFD? Useless.
---
As a level 42 tank, I recently took a level 30 healer into both SM Cathedral and RFD recently; and because he and the rest of my group didn't suck, we were fine and got through it without wiping once.
---
True, despite the fact that only 59 US/EU guilds cleared Naxx 40, somehow every group and guild I run into all the players were guild officers and had Naxx on farm, while also getting Rank 13 (because they had a life so they couldn't grind to Rank 14).
---
The amount of straight up insecure losers that populate this game and make unsubstantiated claims is incredible. No, I didn't clear Naxx 40. I never even raided. I was a dumbass 12 year old kid with a computer that couldn't even run any major city except at 4 am weekdays because the amount of players would crash my shit.
---
So, in phase 3? A tailoring go set will come out - bloodvine garb - it will be your bis and it has a set bonus that requires tailoring.  
---
Best suggestion? No idea, but eventually get tailoring on that mage (I wouldn’t bother with RotArchmage though)
---
I got our first on Tues. 2 of us tied at 96. Rerolled guildie rolled a 96 again and I rolled a 97.

I'm not sure if there's any warnings or anything like that, just going from some of the threads posted here it seems like they just close them without too much warning.
---
&gt;I did not notice anything posted what a shitty situation
---
It's a rough spot and I hope it works out for you, even though the chances aren't that great, I'd suggest trying a ticket with Blizzard and hoping for the best.
---
Same but a PvE server for me

 I see Dartlic all the time announcing arrivals and departures of The Lady Mehley. I just adore him. Really cool to see him on reddit.

Ye got a ticket open and my fingers crossed!

I can't figure out how to get timers to show on my DoTs as a warlock. I have OmniCC and Classic Aura Durations. I just want to know when my CoA/Corruption etc. are about to expire on my target.

If you were synced on your screen given the latency to the server you were probably after him on his screen.

these comments make me super depressed. 2 MC runs on my druid and I still don't have a single tier 1 piece..
---
Got it, thanks.!
---
Thanks for the good answer. A couple follow up questions. 
---
1 when you say turning your pvp flag on, what is that? Is it an option when you right click on your your character in the top left of screen? So you just turn on PVP “flag” and the opposing faction can see your flag is on. 
---
2 I may just not be understanding how people play but wouldn’t there be the possibility of just being always killed by people higher level than you that are tormenting you or camping an area and what can you do about it. What if I’m questing in a zone and I’m level 30 and there’s a group of 5 level 60s patrolling the area to kill me on sight and I just can’t do anything about it

Druids just get the shaft unless they're healers and a lot of druids don't roll heals. If they wanted to heal from the get go they'd probably make a different class. I want to make a druid alt for feral fun so I basically understand I wouldn't be raiding with that druid unless I'm dragged in. Which I don't want to have happen cuz I want my main to raid.
---
Well done. Excellent video too, chill music and footage. your hunter addon is sweet.

I really didn’t.  Lol, got the robes off the boss in the cave in zf last night.

Nah this ring is BiS for resto shamans in phase 1. Also. Hard to imagine a 500 shield not being really good in pvp?

I mean, if you're only caring about gear because of how it makes you appear to others.. then idk, that's very different than how I play. Personally I don't even really care about it and have never understood the obsession and drama. Well all get it eventually, it's not a race or anything. We're all going to look the same in the end.

Pull her and run to the little rock near her platform/island thing. Strafe back and forward while on one side with her on the opposite side. Keep applying dots as they drop off. Only send voidy in if you need a second to reset position.

I wish they were profitable on Sulfuras.  I had the pattern really early on and already had mats stashed away and ready.  Ended up just selling the herbs.
---
&gt; Not a strawman when the OP literally compares it to "almost like district level management?!" in his imagined job interview. No, leading a raid is not like managing a full district of a large corporation. 
---
This is for sure a strawman. You are replying to a thread that was a joke. There is literally a humor tag on this thread. He is not conflating being a raid leader with being a district manager of 200 people. He is literally giving you the punchline by having the interviewer mistakenly guess that the RL's title was district manager based on the described experience.
---
What people in this comment chain are discussing is the nugget of truth in this joke. Trying to pin some literal interpretation of a made up humorous exchange and then arguing against this literal interpretation that no one but you made is the definition of straw man.
---
&gt;I fundamentally disagree with you that it's nearly as difficult as you're making it out to be. It's getting people to work together and kill a video game boss. It has its complexities but it's still little more than just that. What you mentioned is all pretty straightforward stuff that isn't at all comparable to actually dealing with serious responsibilities for people's livelihoods and the success of an actual business.
---
IT absolutely is comparable, we're doing it right now. The fundamental skills of leadership is for sure present. You keep saying it's not comparable, how about giving some fundamental reasons for why? I'm saying this as someone who has been in the working world for over a decade. 
---
&gt;human resources
---
Recruiting and managing a guild of hundreds of people is absolutely comparable. The fact you can't threaten someone with their livelihood makes getting people to commit to work within a video game much more difficult, not easier. Also you need to deal with the drama and disputes of hundreds of people. This absolutely translates to whatever human resources in the business world.
---
&gt;logistics
---
Extremely important and extensive part of raid leading too. Keeping track of hundreds of people's individual gear and enchants, deciding how to allocate gear to best benefit raid clearance time, keeping track of everyone's consumes each week to see who's slacking, finding the best debuff synergy for the raid composition, world buffs including dm buffs for an entire raid, dealing with enemy factions camping outside of raids, etc.
---
&gt;investments
---
Obviously present in WoW. I mean just to get to raiding you need to invest hundreds of hours (hopefully efficiently) to get to level 60 and gear up to earn a spot over others. Guilds need to manage their resources to get the best results (gearing up tanks and off tank first for example). They also need to invest in players because there's always turnover and some guildies quit. I mean, to be honest, some district manager ain't making a whole lot of executive level investment decisions neither.
---
&gt;marketing
---
I'm going to be honest. If you can market your guild to get hundreds of players at max level with raiding gear/experience to join, you are better at marketing that the vast majority of district managers who mostly follow orders and make very few actual marketing decisions.
---
&gt;contracts
---
District managers are not drafting up legal contracts. Even if they get to give inputs, this ain't that complicated. Even lawyers copy and paste most legal contracts from previous contracts anyway.
---
&gt;accounting
---
Plenty of accounting in RL, I have the spreadsheets of our guild bank. Yes, you're not going to learn first in first out stuff, but the principles of keeping track of how resources are flowing is there. And it absolutely translates to "business world" accounting, you're just teaching them different resources. Again, most district managers are not doing the accounting of their companies.
---
&gt;consumer protection
---
This is getting into specifics that are outside the realm of broad leadership skills. A hotel manager is not gonna know too much about quality control in some manufacturing business. 
---
&gt;insurance
---
I'll give you this one but insurance is not that hard at the district manager level. Again, most of them are following orders.
---
&gt;revenue
---
Integral part of WoW
---
&gt;staffing
---
Talked about recruiting already
---
&gt;location
---
This is getting specific and is outside the braod scope of leadership. Many businesses don't even have physical locations.
---
&gt;market analysis
---
Plenty of that in WoW
---
&gt;real pressure and responsibilities
---
The pressures and responsibilities of raid leaders are real. The point you're making is that the stakes are lower. But that's why we're comparing the two, not equating the two. If the stakes of both were the same, and you are a successful leader already, then there's nothing to discuss here.
---
&gt;growth,
---
Growth and progression are part of WoW.
---
&gt;price setting, finances
---
Part of WoW.
---
&gt;actual problems that don't relate to simple stuff like who gets what piece of loot
---
Problem solving is a skill that can be learned through games. Also, dealing with people in a resource scarce environment translates very well.
---
&gt;liability, trade agreements, imports/exports, overall corporate strategy, risk assessments, quality assurance, streamlining and cutting costs, sustainability
---
I appreciate the copy and paste but most of this is either present in WoW or is outside the fundamentals of leadership. I mean there's guild raiding coalitions for small guilds that want to raid together out there and they need to negotiate terms on how to distribute resources. Cutting costs? Trying to do raids with fewer and fewer members so loot get distributed to fewer people is a thing. Trying to do raids with cheaper consumes is a thing. Trying to do raids faster is a thing. Sustainability? Like stop copy and pasting and maybe think about points your making. How many guilds now are lasting until Naxx? Of course sustainability is a big concern and requires a lot of effort and skill from a successful raid leader.
---
&gt;high level negotiations and presentations, future projections, and dozens of other things that anyone at the upper management level of any serious corporation should at least have a basic understanding of. My dad's a senior consultant and recruiter for one of the largest consulting firms in the world, and I can't imagine he'd even want to listen to someone who genuinely believes that getting a group of people to behave and work together in a game is a substitute for actually being a manager with real work experience and gives them the necessary qualifications, knowledge and skills for such a position. There's a reason why people spend years of their life getting degrees in business, finance, economics and corporate management to hold these positions, and that isn't because you'd get the same skills and knowledge from leading a raid party in an MMO. 
---
I think your issue is you keep arguing against a strawman argument that no one but you has made. Nobody here except you is talking about transitioning from raid leading in WoW to c level management or working as a senior corporate consultant at BCG. We're talking about broad leadership skills that do indeed translate to the real life business world.
---
If I see a good leader in WoW, just like if I see a good leader working in garbage collection, that's a strong indication that he will have a far higher likelihood of thriving in other leadership positions. Now the excellent leader who manages garbagemen probably isn't goign to do too well managing project development at some software company or leading scientific research at some medical school lab but that relates to the "learning curve" specific to each industry rather than the broad and general leadership skills. The same could be said about your dad or any successful CEO in the world. No matter how successful they are in their field, they probably aren't going to challenge Method on world firsts. They certainly aren't displacing empire's control in EVE online. But that's not because those CEOs are bad leaders, it's just different industries.
---
Here's my point: good leaders are one in a million. If you can sustain a raiding guild until Naxx, I would honestly consider that a major and positive indication of your abilities. I'm not putting that guy in charge of anything that requires extensive experience and knowledge, but once that guy obtains the experience/knowledge, he's a prime candidate for leadership.
---
Yeah, I feel like a lot of clown hunters are about to learn a lot about the pains of the demons despawning. Saw a hunter using their pet against the winterspring one and kinda felt bad for them.
---
Durotar rules;  
---
No leaving the other players max draw distance.  
---
No stalling out the duel (CC/bandage is okay etc)  
---
No BM (Ex. Gnomish mind controlling melee off ledges so they can't fight back)  
---
Engineering is allowed by default unless stated by either party.  
---
No AH consumables by default unless stated by either party.  
---
No Pre-potting/Pre-flare/Pre-casting etc.  
---
It's good manners (but not required) to /whisper G when the duel goes live as a stealth player to let the other person know you aren't going to stealth troll/stall etc.  
---
No mean spirited shit-talking before/during/after the duel, regardless of the result (Fun Banter is 100% okay, it's a major part of duelling.).  
---
If a player requests a duel without saying a word to you it automatically defaults into a standard everything allowed cheese/BM duel.

Constant automatic disco ball - what's not to like?

I, too, was trying to be kind and help a warrior the other day. He was fighting mobs in the Swamp of Sorrows and I was running around gathering herbs. I passed him a few times when he was finishing combat and had low health so I would just sheep him and blink away. The one time he saw me first he charged and tried to attack. I just said "Oh ewe!" and hit him with another one.
---
If you think being an officer in a guild or raid lead is just this then wew lad

What?
---
Is there an Ally equivalent of this?
---
plus if youre having trouble with pyro chug a superior health potion everytime. you're losing i think 1s25c for the potential of a 4g weapon and a 15-20s kill.
---
Yeah, an extra Mana bar for priests and mid-combat rez is bad I hear!
---
Also Sulfuras Alliance. For validity, we raided Org tonight and killed Thrall with ease. We proceeded to TB and got scattered, so the raid went home. An hour later when they the Horse hit SW, they couldn't even breach the front gate. Good night for Alliance on Sulfuras!
---
Youre not a mage.  Run dungeons &amp; quest intelligently.

I had to sell my superior healing pots in /y for 20s a stack.

In the classic hunter class discord there is a link to a theorycraft simulation spreadsheet which will show such values for a given context of current gear. But its roughly 20ap.

Goldshire. It is pretty generic but back when I first started, it was where all the cool kids hung out and I wished I could be as high level as them. Some good memories.
---
Asking someone to send you something COD is by far the most profitable way to play the economy. You have a non-zero chance, in my experience upwards of 15-30%, of this exact scenario happening.
---
And if you dont send them any money back your profit margin doubles, and they learn their lesson extra well.
---
/u/JG_ShinWeeb if u feelin froggy leap

My idea of fun is being the best. I don’t force anyone. People know what they’re getting into before they join. The entire raid team is going engineering as we speak to increase clear speed. Maybe try hard isn’t fun for you but its a blast for me. I can’t stand being mediocre.
---
No one is leaving. We’re actually known as one of the best communities on my server. We do server wide events. We just absorbed a guild. They wanted to join us. Just because you think it’s horrible doesn’t make it so. The people who raid with me WANT to get prebis. They WANT to be the best. No one is forced to do anything because they all do it voluntarily.
---
So, as a warlock am I allowed to use hearthstone or not? What is the conventional belief?
---
I just did this today .
---
True
---
Hey Pingaan, 
---
first off thanks for the List. Proved very useful for my guild. 
---
I'd like to add that with the introduction of Dire Maul the Leatherwork Pattern for [Mongoose Boots](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18506/mongoose-boots)
---
became available. As you can see they should be BiS for the Feral Tank compared to the [Shadowcraft Boots](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16711/shadowcraft-boots).
---
Admittedly only by 5 Armour and 2 Agility..but still an upgrade.
---
That’s rough, congrats!
---
What an odd way to jump, jumping is the most satisfying  thing in the game, it should be the biggest button that you have access to!
---
If you have a mage with you, let the mage target magistrate once you zone in the side entrance, then as soon as the gate is clicked, have the mage blink forward and CS magistrate, this pulls aggro on him preventing him from running away, then the mage can ice block, group members peel off the trash while the tank takes magistrate, makes for a quick farm
---
Posture check
---
Good point.
---
Something else might be interfering, I can confirm those addons work when used together.
---
Herb/mining combined together I find is more fun + makes me great gold per hour. Plus I can stealth places like caves (silithus) and get at nodes most people can't)
---
Warrior if you're willing to tank, Rogue if you're not.
---
Yeah I dont get it.
---
StV - first real world pvp begins. The nostalgia was so real walking in for the first time as a Rogue. I loved it.
---
The addon Chatter does this, Prat might as well.
---
Barrens, trying to find Mankrik's wife
---
Alliance warlocks can get a hat at 25, but that’s all i know
---
Some are worse than others and it depends on the server. SM and ZF have been fine. Ulda not so much.
---
Once they turn into demons they can be "interacted" with in the fact that they'll nearly instantly destroy you. The comment youre replying to was probably running on the road and aggrod the activated demon
---
I literally just said i don’t even have full prebis. We 100% expect people to work on getting it though. We don’t force anyone though. Everyone joins my raid team knowing how hard we go. My guild actually just absorbed another guild because they thought we were the best community on the server. We even host server wide pvp events. You can interpret text how you want. But you’re not on my server so you have no idea what you’re really talking about.
---
This is really, really helpful! Thank you so much for taking the time to write all of this out for me.   
---
I have the addon ItemRack and it gives the option to switch between gear depending on whether or not I'm in Shadowform, which has been awesome, but so far I only have the Felcloth hood, lol. I have a lot of healing pre-raid BiS in case my guild needs me to heal, but I'm going to keep working on shadow gear as well. Also, the tip about the spell ranks is very helpful. I'll keep that in mind.   
---
Thanks again for your advice! Once I get a few more pieces of pre-raid BiS gear, I'll feel much more confident joining groups as DPS!
---
People across the board complain about them on reddit, so theory is still good
---
You cleared it in a day, private server guilds clear it in less than an hour.
---
...but then you won't be able to use all of your available mana because fights are short.
---
I did. I found it. It’s obvious.
---
My favorite place is the Icecrown Citadel, the whole theme is just epic af.
---
Where?
---
What server should I choose as a newbie who wants to play PvP and interact with others? I'm from Europe and would want an English server. I tried Firemaw, but how good is the server? I'd like a sustainable server that is as balanced as possible.
---
Skeram. Very unbalanced favoring horde considerably. Join up and help the Alliance!
---
By this logic, there would be no Alliance for Horde to fight on PVP servers.
---
Look at my edit

---
I will now use Mocking Blow
---
Blameaux and Benediction seem to be the best two servers for alliance if you want a close to 50/50 population ratio. Whitemane isn't too bad, but it's PST I think? Although time doesn't really matter now in 2019 since there's guilds raiding across all time zones on all servers as well as there being no such thing as East coast servers anymore since theyre located in Chicago.
---
well, FWIW, i always reply to pst's.
---
it's kinda flattering that people would ask. usually im not interested in tanking at that moment (if i was, i'd already be in a dungeon XD) but it's nice to get asked and to reply.
---
Here in VA 5 guys is baller. But it was founded near here, so I can understand why.
---
Yeah you found it haha
---
Lol Alli. Cute
---
Honestly, from the healer's perspective, I prefer rogues. If they are half decent, which in my experience many rogues are, they reduce incoming damage by a lot.
---
Forreals been looking for a rogue energy tick display on twitch. Is that add-on on twitch aswell?
---
i’d like to watch this
---
Is there any water other than the lvl 55 conjured water that is better than Morning Glory Few?
---
as in bid price or sell out price?
---
This is gold right here man.
---
RP PVP - balanced horde and alliance, alliance slightly bigger but not noticeable. Friendly server relative to my previous experiences. Go horde side, not biased at all.
---
Yes Argent Dawn quartermaster sells water that is equal to the lvl 55 mage water.
---
&gt;Not trying to be a gatekeeper here but 10 is prob closer to average.
---
Average hours a day that people play WoW? No way. Lmao. 
---
10 hrs a day is an outlier.
---
Felwood, 
---
It’s where I initially hit 60 when vanilla wow came out.
---
I assume you are talking metaphorically.
---
100% profit would be 1copper to 2 copper. 
---
1,000% 1 copper --&gt; 10 copper
---
10,000% 1 copper --&gt; 100 copper (1 silver)
---
so 10,000% profit (or a bit less), was curious
---
For leveling just stick to arms. At 60 you can swap to DW fury or 2H Fury(If Horde). Arms does garbage damage compared to Fury though at 60 but is solid for PvP of course. You'll just rock a typical 31/20/0 build for Arms. 
---
Don't worry about prot. Unless you want to full time tank you can do it fine as arms or fury spec. Even as fury you still get Tac Mastery after all.
---
What the guy above said. If someone thinks your a meme as a feral tank, dip out. Nobody has time for that kinda negativity, especially considering you can clear every boss/raid as a feral except for like 3 bosses that have fear mechanics.
---
On whitemane I was nobody. I was just a rando in a mass of 20000 people. I was tired of the min max mentality that a lot of these mega servers have. I’m in a horde guild that has MC and Ony on farm, so we are not behind at all as far as content goes. I’m able to play elemental shaman, something I probably wouldn’t be able to easily do on Whitemane. There is plenty of world PvP, just doesn’t feel oversaturated. 
---
Basically it feels like vanilla wow.
---
yeah there's a few goblins on my server so gl sniping and unless im going to camp the ah bidding is useless XD
---
Some dwarves just can't leave those troll holes alone.
---
Nta that's hilarious
---
Alliance - NA - Whitemane - PVP
---
60 Druid with bear and resto pre-BIS. Current guild is just a few IRL friends. I'd like to join a consistent raiding guild that would accept a feral tank who can offheal.
---
I work nights, so I'm usually available after 1130 pm on weeknights, but I'm good until around 4am (PST). Weekend day/nights are also great for me.
---
It doesn’t slow anything down. Warlocks are very comfortable not being at full HP before every fight. Almost like the kit is designed for it.
---
That would be amazing. But like if you hit 60 on a hardcore iron man and die you just move to a regular iron man so kinda like an achievement to save all your work.
---
It's something entirely different when you're out there discovering the world for the first time. Think about it, no knowledge of any Quests, any Zones or any Dungeons. AddOns were scarce, and had a pretty big barrier of entry for the casual player.
---
Hormonal “imbalances” aren’t major swings in BMR. PCOS is at most a 400 calorie a day change in BMR and comes with a reduction in appetite to begin with (and is also caused by obesity itself.....). That’s the equivalent of skipping breakfast. Hypothyroidism is attributable to only 5-10 pounds of excess body weight on average.  Those are not causes of obesity. Nor hinder ability to achieving normal body weight. 
---
This kind of thought and disinformation is so bad to people losing weight. Neither of those conditions “require” or even are helped by exercise if weight loss is your primary need.
---
The dying and loosing everything its the best part :) it makes every fight a thrill

Almost everything I post gets deleted. I legit hate Reddit. But there is nothing else to do at work lol.

---
I've only really ever played WoW on PC and since 2006 I've been like 80% keyboard turner, usually going with the mouse only in sticky situations. 
---
I'm not proud of it. I've just never taken the time to break the habit.
---
You still miss some overlap with hs queue trick, I'm not sure on the math if it's worth keeping 9% just for that, it would vary with all different weapon speeds. 2math4me
---
When you pickpocket you have a good chance of getting lock boxes, which usually have a few copper and some poison mats inside, but also serve to level lockpicking. That is one of the easiest ways to level it other than the occasional rounds of world boxes you can find in lakes.
---
&gt; The biggest legit negative is stigma(and possibly having to be a tauren or night elf).

Oof, spot on. I LOVE my Druid. I haven’t enjoyed leveling/questing/dungeoning so much before. I’m a better tank in dungeons than I was as a warrior, better at 1v1 PvP than I was as a warrior, and Jesus Christ questing as a Druid is a joke since I can easily 1v3 mobs my level, solo any elite, or stealth straight to where I need to be and skip the bullshit.   
---
And although I’ve learned to love my Tauren, god damn I WISH I WAS A GREENSKIN. I just want to be a Troll or an Orc, is that too much to ask? The Earth Mother is cool and all but THRALL IS MY WARCHIEF. I want to be like him :(
---
There is nothing to explain because this postliterally doesn't pertain to anything logical
---
Yeah, was honestly frustrating to read through.
---
Oh well.
---
I watched an "advanced shaman leveling guide" on a channel called Defcamp and melderon tv, not sure if that's the same one you're talking about. But if it is, most of the info in that video is bad. I respect the amount of work they put into it, but they have a pretty bad understanding of the game's mechanics which shows clearly in their stat priorities and spell rotation recommendations. I've been doing pretty much the opposite of everything they advise and have been seeing better damage, leading their "dps by spec" graph by 30-50% at every level. As well as better time/mana efficiency, I only bought one stack of melon juice at level 40 and carried it through the next 7 levels as an elemental spec.
---
The #1 most important thing for your damage as a shaman is simply keeping your spell ranks up to date, and then casting them at the right time, and in the right order. The best stat for shamans to prioritize is spirit, because you can get it high enough to fully regenerate your mana spent in every fight (icemail jerkin is bis for leveling, lol). Even as an enhance spec, you still get over half of your damage from spells if you're utilizing them properly, which they give exactly the wrong way to do in their guide.
---
For some reason it doesn't.
---
Thats a choose, not a thing forced onto you. Plenty of cadual social guilds exist join one.
---
I did mention that they were known as solid healers.
---
It is a repeatable quest and the traps can drop a fishing pole worth good money too
---
Yeah that would be nice too. If you managed to get to 60 without dying you should definitely get some recognition. You character name on a plate on the main cities maybe ;)
---
One has harsher consequences than the other.  Just because its a game does not make it less of a job for some people.    Try explaining to your 4 hunters that there is no room for them because their class was just gutted.  There are parallels between the two, and use a lot of the same skills.  The main difference between the two is in the real world you just don't attempt things that have a high chance of failure, whereas in raiding you will attempt it until you get it right.
---
Well too bad.
---
you can farm it with just 1 hunter friend. go watch a hunter solo guide for angerforge. you can help a lot as a rogue there, just start running after angerforge when he is around 75% health, kill him together from that point on. vanish at the end
---
Sweet, personally I've had terrible luck with both alienware systems I've had and even worse customer service
---
How about the fact that, even though the cat does suboptimal dps, during a boss fight it...  
---
battle rezzes someone; and,
---
innervates a healer.   
---
When you take those factors into account, is that not better than just having a rogue do more DPS?
---
John Rambo is that you?
---
Tbh rogues have I think the fewest spells out of any class.
---
I essentially got mine by tanking Scarlet Monastery runs for ten nights or so.
---
Money is vastly easier to obtain after 40 than before 40.  Let yourself hit 40 without the mount, and go to places like Stranglethorn and Tanaris.  Do some questing, and do lots of farming, as well as instance tanking.  You can make plenty of money just selling to vendors.
---
The mount will come.  You will eventually accumulate 100 gold completely spontaneously, just from playing the game.  Don't stress, don't look down on yourself for not having it instantly at 40, and just let it happen when it happens.
---
Classic+ with reworked talent trees, and/or new classes would be incredible in my opinion - though they would have to be very careful. It would be cool to see Enhancement Shaman actually be able to tank (maybe add a talent at level 40 to wear plate armor, and add some kind of taunt, instead of dual wielding). And make ret pallys a real dps, give them a talent to dual wield, give them actual abilities to use, etc.
---
Rock eles are a terrible choice - poison immune and tanky.
---
Posture Check
---
Warlocks are 100% Neutral Evil, which is true evil.
---
Youre not wrong but regardless of that its a higher dps weapon and has 1% parry built in so kind of no contest
---
Karazhan, the mystery of the place, the crypts everyone at one point glitched into. And ofc us finally getting to go there in burning crusade.
---
STV, i love pvp
---
I honestly debated setting up a rig to run 40 accounts. 40 mages. Raid everything. Arcane explosion GG
---
Having 7 level 35 toons could make some decent gold as they could all have max professions.
---
Yeah, unlikely to be banned. Acti-blizz wants those subs.
---
Wow Fucking insane bro
---
You aren’t understanding what the guy is asking at all
---
thank you :)
---
If I wanna comment on a video, or thread from 3 years ago, I will damn well do what I want. 
---
 Mofos getting butthurt because I don't give a shit? It's never to late to piss people off. Gotta remember that kiddos.
---
Stranglethorn vale the epitome of a ganking zone.
---
Only solution is to nerf mages
---
Exactly. I enjoy fighting people my level over mob spawns or resource nodes. Sometimes I'll snipe the random rogue who follows to closely on their mount for too long. Camping someone far below my level is stupid as fuck. I gain nothing from it, they won't enjoy it at all, nobody really wins. The best PvP imo tends to happen in random caves where quests send you. You run into someone of the other faction doing the quest and you battle it out 1v1 or 1v2 for rights to the tags. Or when two groups of 5 cross paths infront of a neutral dungeon like ZF, ST, Mara, etc. Hell, even lots of small skirmishes over a mob that breaks out into a 20+ person battle randomly. That shit is fun AF. I'll never understand what is fun though playing a warlock and standing in a spot that guards won't aggro you and just melting every unsuspecting player 20 levels below you that walks into town over and over and over and over.
---
That's how it was in vanilla. It's not because of acti-blizz
---
So do priests just get gkicked at 40?
---
I can freely admit that Druids are suboptimal; but your choice of words here, indicates that you are actively searching for a reason to be cruel to people.
---
I rolled a tanking Warrior at least in part because I acknowledge the fact that raiding is dominated by people with the mindset that you have expressed here.
---
I've seen enough of said mindset, however, to know that numbers or anything that is claimed to be objective, really has very little to do with it.  Those things in your case are just excuses; because again, if you weren't just looking for any reason you could get for projecting your own misery onto others, then even if someone playing a Druid was suboptimal for a given scenario, you'd still find a way to tell them that without being vindictive.
---
You ***want*** to treat people like shit.
---
That guy seems like he’s got a real stick up the ass; it’s not like the other guy was being an asshole or anything
---
You don't die, there's a spot that allows you to drop aggro in the arena.
---
I don't think the boss despawns even if you die though. Its only the first 2 waves that will despawn (and fail the event) if you don't engage them in a set amount of time.
---
I've sat around 20 minute in the arena to give away certain bosses in the arena, so I'm pretty sure the arena bosses don't despawn, or at least it takes a really long time.
---
No, there isnt. The Alliance quests were finished first and given polish. The horde side were done later or last and were not polished.
---
Its Stranglethorn Vale - i always look forward to seeing that place again! In the leveling journey, the moment where you get to STV is the moment that the game opens up, adding the other faction as a serious factor in the game!
---
Good ole follow feature in classic wow. Gonna be good when bg’s come out
---
Why farm for specific items when you can just do your BiS gold making method and buy them? You waste so much time that way
---
&gt; You also mentioned that if you plan to raid as a hybrid, don’t bother, which seemed to be blatantly bad advise, however most of your post is accurate, just wanted to say that I disagreed with that statement.
---
I wasn't talking about whether or not a hybrid could actually be decent in a raid.  I was talking about the player prejudice that I have observed.
---
Dayum this is nice. Boi is swole af.
---
Keep posting please
---
Get off reddit and play the videogame sounds like a good strat for catching up
---
Untill a mob respawns on you while your low when your 8.5 days played and suddenly your sitting back in "lumby" regretting setting those rules.
---
I actually agree with you. Playing whatever I want is selfish. But who the fuck are you to tell me what class or spec I am allowed to play and enjoy in a game I pay for ? At the end of the day everyone has their place in WoW.  If you or your guild are min-maxing and not accepting Retribution Paladins, yeah i can understand that, the reason are clear.
---
But calling them fucking egoists for playing something they enjoy is just an asshole-move. If the guild can accept a Retribution Paladin running with them and everyone is having fun and is fine with it, but you are ranting about the SELFISH paladin. You obv. dont fit the mindset of the guild at should find another place.
---
I would think about who is the real egoist, the person who is actually just want to enjoy the game in his own way. Or the guy ranting about the guy not being on the top of the damage meter and taking up a precious raid spot.
---
You can't be serious..  
---
This was a random event on a random server, so most horde are afk or unaware, with only a few people to defend. When he does it there's 50 k people watching and out of those at least a few hundred getting ready to defend, alongside those that would organically be in the city.
---
Get lucky, put on fr, have more health, but mostly get lucky or afk those pulls lol
---
Winter spring, I love winter and it reminded me of the area I grew up in.
---
On my server theres legitimately more groups looking for dps than healers for max/near max level content.
---
I have gotten a few green rings around lvl52
---
Wtf
---
First time tanking?
---
Why you no pro
---
If I was still playing on a PvP server, (which I am not) then STV is one of the main zones in the game which I would stay out of entirely.  I was close to getting the Conqueror PvP title when I gave up in WoTLK due to Paladins being overpowered to the point of complete brokenness; and I have well and truly done my time in STV.  I am over 40 now.  I don't want that kind of stress any more.
---
The main reason why the Vale is such a hot zone for PvP is because it shares a border with Duskwood, which is the Alliance's buffer zone that is right next to Stormwind.  It's very easy for Alliance players to go there straight after Duskwood.  Arathi also borders Dun Morogh, which is likewise the reason why Hillsbrad is generally a war zone as well.
---
Go to Desolace or Thousand Needles.  You will still get occasional gankers on Darkcloud Pinnacle, but not to anywhere near the same degree.  Both of those zones are a relatively long distance away from Alliance territory.  Frontiers and borders are where you find fighting; both in WoW, and in the real world.
---
If you must go into STV at all, then keep to the south.  The Duskwood border is where you are most likely to get ganked, because that is where the Alliance have the shortest distance to travel from; although even on my Normal server, Alliance players like camping the troll spawns on the beach.
---
Looks ?
---
You barely tank her. You touch her once or twice but otherwise just taunting off the dps since she has her age knockback. You can easily do mara now
---
happy happy happy
---
Druid is fine for tanking too.
---
Dudes arms are shredded. I mean— what do the night elves use for supplements ?
---
Funny how it's always ally cryinf about horde favouritism and horde crying about ally favouritism.
---
F
---
Burning Steppes, I love killing the dragonkin probably spent over 45days  straight in that place accumulated time.
---
I'm aware, nothing was done then, nothing will be done now. How this is an enjoyable way to play is beyond me but to each their own.
---
Gonna hug my dog, brb.
---
Orgrimmar bank roof where i spend most og my days.
---
Yeah, that's  about to change
---
That  is simply not true. Swiftmend has a lot less impact on your output compared to moonglow, due to swiftmends cost. And if you need a panicbutton every 15 sec, then you are doing something wrong while healing. What druids bring is the most effective heal in the game, excluding paladins in full crit gear in later phases. You will be able to sustain you tank longer the the priests. With moonglow you can also use regrowth and rejuvenation more liberally on the tanks. Where i can see swiftmend beeing used is if you stack int gear as opposed to +healing gear, but then you output will be significantly worse.
---
thanks. Mean if your groups are trash and you are constantly getting hit then yeah there's no point to this ring. But seriously, in a good group. This ring is mad good.
---
I did the same with a wolf and named her after my dead dog. I get where you're coming from. F
---
Did you check if in your grid2 options incoming heals is unticked? I was wondering the same and ticking the box in settings fixed it
---
This is 1000% not worth attempting as a leveling method
---
I would join
---
No I havent played for about a year but I was doing at least 1 or  2 runs a month for 3 or 4 expansions
---
What if I’m an undead shadow priest?

The icons and their future actions after Vanilla prove what their intentions with the system were.

---
You go from an auto attacking go afk class to extremely active and its VERY powerful. You have to get down to reckoning though which takes awhile and you want to respec to it once you get the correct level which is sometime mid 30's.
---
Mulgore, safest place a cow can be.

Did we just become best friends?

on my server i've not single a single spell cleave ad, nor any group with reserved loot so far, so i'm mostly on the outside looking in with this interesting culture emerging from the classic servers. i'm very happy with my server choice, and while it's definitely not for everyone, bloodsail buccaneers has made my time in classic INCREDIBLY wonderful. i was worried at first without wpvp but the people i meet has made it so worthwhile :^ ) i hope everyone else manages to find their perfect server too!! congrats op!
---
ElvUI
---
Lol classic wow duh
---
If you have the gear, fury prot is good. If u lack gear go full prot.
---
I dont have tactical mastery, so I have a few charging macros;
---
Showtooltip charge
---
/cast charge
---
/cast berserker stance
---
Replace berserker with defensive and you've got 2 charge macros that give you the rage of charge in either stance without having tactical mastery
---
I just rolled my first priest and it’s going to be the first time running a healer. What addons are essential and will make life a lot easier running through dungeons and groups? Also any tips and tricks will be greatly appreciated!

Holy shit. Small world. It is the boat guy..

One, I agree with your guild's decision
---
Two, Blizz isn't going to arbitrate a guild dispute, they really only step in for pugs and carries.  If you don't like the guild's loot system, find a new guild.
---
You can possibly play Outer Worlds and come back after youre done with pvp still not out so, you wouldnt be missing anything.
---
What shield/shoulder/helm combo is that?
---
I feel Skeram alliance have gotten stronger over the past month. Glad I stuck it out
---
My favorite zone has always been the Eastern Plaguelands.  Seeing Stratholme and other cities you help destroy in WC3 always sparked my imagination.
---
Ice-Nay
---
fury tanking works but honestly you can just stay arms and tank just fine. Dont need to specifically spec into prot unless youre MT tanking raids or something.
---
Probably the wrong sub to ask this in
---
Thank you boat guy you made my night. I thought you were an NPC you made me laugh.
---
Then you walked off the boat into the water by mistake and I cried laughing.
---
Thank you boat guy.
---
How is the BRD pickpocketing you the way? Do you ever get random fails? How is the gold per hour?
---
I ask because I’m currently leveling up a Rogue alt.
---
And as a fun twist, we rarely cared who was what. Shadow priest? Sure! Boomkin? Even better! We operated on the idea that most people would either want to gear up more characters later or knew a partner in crime that could help us out. It largely worked.
---
I really need to play again once my failure to clone (re: my baby) is older. Missing that guild atmosphere.
---
The definition of viable is "able to work succesfully". As such, any spec that is able to takr part in clearing a run is technically viable. Suboptimal, yes, but viable by definition.
---
On you bkindfolded example; this is also viable if you can clear the game that way.
---
You have no idea how silly that question sounds. :D Just do whatever. This is classicwow subreddit. What answer would you expect?
---
HealBot or VuhDo, both are good, choose the one you prefer
---
I downloaded it manually not sure if it's on the twitch app.https://youtu.be/3hrDzZN0bDg this guy is really good at rogue or just PVP in general so I took it from his add-on guide
---
I'm so proud of you! Keep up the awesome work and you're going to nail your goal!
---
Arthas would be dissapointed
---
We used the front entrance yesterday because there was an alliance raid camping the side one.
---
Sorry but even if you can’t use it yet, that’s a bis weapon for a leveling warrior..
---
I dig it!!!
---
The only thing I would change would be to try making the chat box fully transparent.
---
My 4 stack of friend is warrior, priest, druid, rogue. We usually get mages as our 5th for dungeons just because of how many there are. We just did the fastest ZF run we've done, by a very very solid margin, with another warrior as our 5th. Mages are great but a mage used the spellcleaving needs to chill and learn the OTHER side of their class.
---
Your guild is wrong. Up to ~40 you should focus on: 
---
Stam&gt;int&gt;spirit&gt;agility&gt;trength on PVP servers or stam=int&gt;spirit&gt;agility&gt;strength on PVE servers.  
---
Once you reach 38 you can get your first piece of shadoweave gear which gives shadow power and the whole set becomes wearable around level 42 which you can buy from the AH.
---
It's okay but it's not BiS.  
---
You can use it if you don't have any other better pieces.  
---
Compare for example the [Cenarion Vestments](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16833/cenarion-vestments) with [Robes of the Exalted](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13346/robes-of-the-exalted), it has 3 times the amount of +healing done.
---
Using the full set, you get +103 healing, using a bis set, you get +362 healing. The difference is pretty massive. The[ bis helm](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19132) alone has almost the same amount of + healing as the entire t1 set.
---
This stuff makes me feel bad. I made my mage because I've played healers forever, and wanted to be ranged dps. It was a toss-up between mage and lock, and i chose mage. I wanted to be a mage. Then the streamers were showcasing how mages are OP levelers, and everyone else rolled a mage. Then all this stuff about dumb mages pulling agro started happening. Ive had multiple tanks yell at me for freezing a group that was moving towards the healer, or leaving the tank. I freeze them AT the tank so he can regain agro, and i back way up. But because its an aoe and he hasnt put 5 sunders on all 3 or 4 mobs yet, people lump me in to the aoe happy mage group. 
---
I cant help that my damage output challenges your agro. If it happens, I slow down. I wait for tank to pull and earn threat then i start attacking. If thats too much i just wand for a while. I freeze when i need to save the healer or the tank loses agro, and I only aoe when Im allowed to. But Im still a dumb mage. 
---
Also healers...if Im getting downed FAST, go ahead and bubble or heal me. I appreciate it. But if Im taking a bit of agro, Ill be fine. Sometimes im pulling agro on purpose amd can use the heal, but if I dont say anything Im probably fine. mages have a few tricks to get away. So dont worry about us too much. 
---
Tanks in SM, let the party know youre gonna pull every mob cluster to the group and dps shouldnt start until theyre on the spot you specify. This way you can hit them and stack your things while moving them, and by the time you get them to the spot itll be real hard for anyone to take your agro, and everyone can go nuts on dps. Its forcing the few seconds you need without outright asking people to let you attack solo.
---
Un'goro cave. Without question. It just calms me. It's one of the few places that slows me down when I am in the area and switches me off from efficiency mode onto sightseeing mode.
---
It's almost like being inside of a Christmas tree. And I love it.
---
Honorable mention: Top of Org bank. Reason: No clue. But that's where I happen to be when chilling in Org.
---
Its BiS for resto sham in p1. Also a ring with 50 stam would be good for pvp, so why is a 500 shield seen as small? Especially when it also restores mana? Seems really good to me.
---
Grind the crocs in southern shimmering flats right near the tanaris entrance
---
Yeah grace period but lock it. Are there any auctions when legitimate bids can be removed like this without a reserve set?
---
Don’t buy weps leveling in general. Unless it’s an alt and you have the gold to support that. There are tons of sword quests and drops from dungeons as you level. Just enjoy the game and swords will come...
---
Outlaw Sabre, Sword of Omen, Thrash blade... just a few that come to mind that you can easily get 
---
Daggers on the other hand is another story
---
Won this on my first ever brd run 😂
---
What's your guild progress? Are you the main tank? If your guild has MC on farm then likely you get geared up fast and your healers geared enough for you to try. If your guild is just starting MC and if you are main tank, it makes more sense to go full prot first.
---
Just remember you need a certain level of gear and the ones healing you also need to have the gear too. Your dps also need to have the level of gear to prevent a long fight.
---
The guy we talk to was still in the middle (??) of my failed attempt so we just sat here looking at the tent for 10 minutes...
---
Icy veins have some decent info on tank hybrid specs including gear requirements.
---
Everyone, including the paly, has the aura. Except for me...
---
Link for the full UI? :)
---
It's not a PVP server so it can't be.
---
Feralas because of the natural green environment
---
What do they drop
---
This was nerfed. 
---
In any grouped situation group members eligible to receive xp will have the amount earned scaled against the party member’s levels in relation to the difficulty of the content. 
---
So if anyone in group is above the intended level for the content the reduction in party xp is reduced exponentially the higher they are above the content level, so in effect if you are run by 60’s in low level content you’ll get no xp.
---
i saw it my second run, and lost the roll to the tank =/ ill never see it again i know it to be true.
---
I don't know if this matters (since I do have the aura just before we enter the instance) however if I queue up again with a paly in my team I'll make sure to check if he has PvP enabled or not.
---
&gt; But I will deliberately avoid inviting mages if I can. Except fire mages. I grouped with one a while back and watching mobs health drop by chunks with each fireball was enjoyable.
---
While spellcleavers can certainly fuck right off as far as I am concerned, as a tank, otherwise I like Mages.  Frost Nova and Polymorph both make my life easier, although I sometimes have to explain to the Mage that I'd like Poly reserved only for four mob pulls, because as Prot, having one or two mobs serve as rage batteries is very useful for me.
---
❤❤😘

Mograin	&gt;ALL

Wow fishing seems awesome. Is fishing worthwhile even for phase 2 and 3?
---
Haha what the fuck.
---
The last part is completely wrong. Why do you spread Info that you obviously have never tested? 
---
You will get exp. And it will be more effective that running the dungeon normally.
---
What kind of druid ? Tank, heal ? In our guild we have 3 heals and 1 tank
---
How is Faerlina in terms of community?
---
Alienware still makes a stellar gaming laptop if you wanna shell out the money.
---
Not even a pet.  Each fight in the chain has a mechanic you can exploit.  It's a pretty solid test of a hunters abilities.
---
legit felt the same about my cuts aswell ahah but i honestly thought they were good 
---
yea ill message you the link dont want to take away from your post ahah
---
Fuk
---
Not even a pet
---
From my experience, since i couple of friends overleveled me and a few that we played dungeons quit due to irl, i had to pug the SM runs alone.
---
And with PUG we rarely rand more than 2 dungeons, let alone farm 5 dungeons in 1 hour.
---
If you do it with a group of friends, or similarly minded people, yeah you can hit 80-100k exp/hr.
---
But from PUGS you can't expect that, since people doing this, well, most likely have a group that runs with them...
---
So it's 1-2 runs, then waiting for at least one person to be replaced.
---
I'm not saying it's not doable, but it's highly unlikely to happen in PUG's.
---
Not everyone can be good
---
Thats awesome, im lvl 42!

This morning. Check the timestamps.

Is there a way to look at people's gear on there? I couldn't find armory.
---
Rip graphics card
---
cool thx much
---
Wtf is wrong with you?
---
We cleared MC last night with a grand total of 2 Random T1 overall. Quite depressing tbh. At this rate everyone will lack the belt and bracers, except Druids and Shaman...
---
mace stuns do NOT DR with kidney shot or cheap shot. Infact you can have the target stunned with all 3 at the same time if you really want, albeit makes zero sense.
---
The first rule of fight club
---
Lol of course it is
---
That is still all personal anecdotes. Like I said, the only 1v1s I get are those I start. I get ganked by alliance all the time though. My point is, its all personal anecdote. Alliance whine and complain in Reddit all the time. It is all personal anecdote though. People are probably quick to forget the times they gank and grief someone, but they will remember when they get corpsecamped or ganked alot. People are gonne complain and whine on Reddit. That is just one side of things and doesn't prove anything.
---
Hey. Those are the trinkets, if you mean near Death Counter. Did that with ItemRack
---
This fantastic, thank you!
---
Nice.
---
Deadmines. Its the first dungeon I ever did and its just so rich with lore and immersion. The quests that lead up to it are cool and it really feels like it belongs in the world rather than random  cave with bad guys in it.
---
100 % this. I didn't level up alchemy, cooking, bought/farmed reagents or trinkets not to use them. Use whatever you want, I will do the same. The winner comes out alive.
---
Tryhard much
---
Cheers, I actually had a different understanding of what he wrote. That makes sense.
---
check on wowhead leveling guides. most of them have list of bis items you can get on your way to 60.
---
Yeah that's horsechit, warrior should've gotten that.
---
That is cool. We are playing Classic though. We don't know the intentions, only the way they continued to design and change the game.
---
Damn that's nice.
---
FAP?
---
Wouldve but he wasnt streaming at the time I uploaded this. This is just a screencap from a yt video
---
Thanks mate! 👍👍
---
It was heavily nerfed by blizzard, which isnt blizzlike at all.
---
It's like someone taking advice for Tour de France and they just bought their first bike. Don't worry about gear. Just play the game. Analyzing your gameplay at this early stage is going to burn you out so fast.
---
r/tworedditorsonecup
---
So you are telling me what i was thinking and writing? i can inform you that your assumptions are wrong.
---
I was just ranting about how stupid it would be of mages to charge for water/food in a instance group, after i asked you a question to establish what you thought of the issue.
---
So we both agree a good teamplayer does not charge for mana usage in an instance group?
---
Then i think we will leave it at that, as much as i love a good discussion, this isnt one.
---
Winterspring, such a lovely aesthetic for such a grueling grind

hey i am a hunter and i am trying to find out if it is woth it to equip  [https://classicdb.ch/?item=13038](https://classicdb.ch/?item=13038) (swiftwind) or just keep  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13137/ironweaver](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13137/ironweaver) (ironweaver) quiver and stuff like that is not a problem
---
Soooo..... me and my fellow neonazis can join right??
---
I mean, if I'm part of a pre-raid tribute run (which doesn't happen in most guilds), chances are I'm either expected to join the raid after, or wanting to on my own accord
---
Lets get this straight. I defended myself on 5x L30's when a L60 tried to gank me. Like i had a advantage there... or attacked him first.
---
Of course you’re going to have that mentality as a main tank when you have ultimate priority.
---
Try setting your side buttons to something that s easier to recognise and play around with that. Like making them the NumPad Numbers or such. Let me know how it goes.
---
Pretty big asshole move by you homie, hope this post isnt trying to brag
---
You became a ninja
---
Go Prot spec for Reckoning and sit/crit/reckbomb cheese your way to 60!
---
Thank you. The journey was half the fun
---
Great one!
---
Why’s that? They pushed for a goal to benefit their raid group then are enjoying the fruits of their labor while playing other games and having fun in the meantime.
---
Hey what's that addon that adds the silver dragon to your portrait?
---
Nobody, but technically there are few weapons that have on-hit effects that scale with spellpower.
---
That's better than the whirlwind axe?
---
If someone is called "Pepetopdeck". Odds are they are shit-stains to begin with.
---
Stop trying to reason with the man.
---
well that is not a problem but i was thinking if the high attack speed at 2 insted of 2,6 is a problem
---
Best Place in the game for me would be Duskwood. The Atmosphere ist just really nice and the leveling there was a lot of fun.
---
It's insane for any tank. 50 AP, 1.25% crit, and 250 hp on a buff that has almost 100% uptime if you're taking roughly a hit per second is amazing
---
You need mining to get mats for lvling engineering. or else its gonna get hella expensive.
---
also, mining is good for gold farming.
---
potions can be bought of someone, engineering has alot of gear and gadgets only a engineer can use.
---
also, search google for "mining guide wow classic" and "engineer guide wow classic" and find some guides you like and follow them to lvl up and get an understanding about how it works.
---
Gratz man, it’s not not much. Now you can finally play the game
---
I'm not really sure if that is correct. Due to the digital nature, you have to be more sensible at times for the written word, and also are faced with more direct critique. You learn how different ppl are and what to expect and how stupid they can/want to behave. And you are also faced with good intentions gone wrong. This are all lessons that can help you.
---
It's not guaranteed success but it helps the devlopment of some GM. And I think it at least helps more than a lot of other hobbies and roles out there.
---
Descolce, its so barren with some of the smoothest questing in the game.
---
I am a Druid and used to used dreadmist for my healing set. They have super high int and stam and anyone can you it. 
---
You can roll on mage and priest gear drops as well.
---
Not working
---
Elwynn forest, I restarted so many characters that I had the entire zone locked down, even after coming back to wow classic after all these years I didnt have to read a single quest since i already knew what to do.
---
Typical mage
---
Essentially, ravager is aoe style play, whirlwind is solo.
---
Maybe I’m tripping but I’m 90% sure that hat you linked isn’t even available yet.
---
Who takes time to put up those stupid fucking rules. Need is need.
---
This mage is a top rated asshole.
---
Unfortunately there is no add-on that does exactly what you want. I've been searching for this since classic launch too.
---
There is nothing wrong with a pve server but if you're complaining that there isn't enough to do, you *should* roll on a pvp server. There is always something going on.
---
Oh, I used it during vanilla, but it had nowhere near the completeness, correctness, Integration and ease of use that sites like e. g. wowhead have today.
---
Stranglethorn Vale or Booty Bay!
---
Are you in advertising? Lol I enjoyed the narrator.
---
Well, the people asked for \#NoChanges. We made the bed ourselves. Time to lay in it.
---
Why no upvotes? I love this kind of stuff. Nice dude
---
is there an addon that shows debuff timers? i.e. how long my gouge is going to last.
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/epf-enhanced
---
Elite player frame.
---
If you are horde with OEB, you will use it even in BWL. I wouldn’t buy a Karol blade.
---
if a server is layerd, the whole realm (not only an area) is existing a secound time.
---
and yes, only if there are to many people online at the same time on one server it will get another layer, so there are not to many people at one playce at a time
---
Thank you, still a lot to do though. I feel like I played one game and now have access to an entirely new (slightly better)  game
---
Nice! Thank you for the info.
---
Leatrix+ can do that, but I think there's also a standalone (leatrix is very handy anyways tho, so I would just get that)
---
I helped my 54 friend kill anger and on the first run it dropped and he won, like wtf? I hadnt even seen one drop before xD
---
[this ](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18203/eskhandars-right-claw)
---
Is that the dragons call sword from ST? Or whatever its called?
---
Man I wish it was
---
I guess not? Care to elaborate instead of just mumbling on by?
---
Haha. Truth
---
also, in 4-6 weeks (before phase 2 hits) there wount be layering anymore and all servers will only have one instance of them
---
Holy crap man, some wicked skills there.
---
Favourite place? Gotta be the old Scarlet Monastery dungeons. So nice to see them again. :D
---
Swamp of sorrows, even though the whelps refuse to give me a pet
---
I grinded my level 60 for all intents and purposes. 
---
You're missing very little if you don't care about lore and player interaction. 
---
Player interaction comes from dungeons/guilds/friends. You'll be alone in some corner if you just grind, but that's not a bad thing. I also enjoy getting away and doing a boring task. 
---
Lore is lore. I absolutely don't care about lore in any way. I can't give you and advice about what you're missing because it's so incredibly low on what the list of what I enjoy that a 30-45 second conversation about the "dark iron dwarves" and "how they caused this BBG to come and fuck everything up" could put me to sleep. 
---
For the most part you're not missing much in the way of content grinding to 60. You'll have time to hit random quests and dungeons as you go. 
---
Almost all the gear you get will be replaced. The very, very few items can be done easily. We're talking under 10 items that I "missed" out on going to 60 that are still useful.
---
OP you should stop being an asshole and use the printscreen button
---
Frost nova I can live without. There are substitutes to polymorph sometimes.
---
Gz! I hope to be 60 tonight, 59,5 atm :)
---
PvP server anything is fair game. Go to PvE server if you don’t want to be camped.
---
I name any pet I get after my dog. 
---
Always have, always will.
---
Tanaris, not sure why.
---
Definitely Un’Goro Crater - soooo many quests to do!!
---
Quest no longer shows in quest log after accidentally destroying eye
---
It'll be 18+ though
---
There's a couple of bosses down road that might become impossible without a warlock though..
---
Aggred.
---
Expecting that other players abide by your own personal notions of online chivalry is the funniest thing.
---
No one really cares how honorable you played, to everyone else you're either a winner or a loser.
---
Horde is made up of stinky trolls and cow people, only cool horde races are dead alliance and green people
---
Levels blacksmithing and wonders why he’s poor.  
---
I’m so tired of these poor people posts. Like real life, poor people are poor because they’re too stupid or lazy to do better.  There’s nothing anyone can say or do to these people to change that.
---
Yeah I read that some butthole Mage rolled need on ravager taking it away from both a Warrior and Pally and was bragging about it.
---
Stormwind as I love the atmosphere and the music (especially as you enter).
---
Tanaris, The footprints in the sand are my favorite environmental storytelling.
---
 2 years later...
---
Ya, I normally tank dungeons but I'm fury and the dungeons I DPS I play healer bodyguard the entire time. It amazes me how many people are just completely oblivious. The tank could help out, but the dps should easily realize the healer had the casters on them and hit them to get threat or pull them in with interrupts
---
Don't be sorry, I dont really give a shit. I'm on an oceanic server that has no big streamers.
---
Im just saying it's illogical to expect people to know to avoid a server if they don't care about streamers.
---
You know chances are people who complain didn't even know rolling on a "streamer server" would even be problematic. They probably saw it went "OK whatever..." not expecting the alleged problems rolling on one entails.
---
As a warlock, I can tell you that you don't really want Dreadmist set, aside for a vanity collection. What you want at this stage is all the spellpower, hit and crit you can get. Even shadoweave mask from level 44 would probably be better. [Check out this link to getter a better idea of what kind of gear you need.](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/warlock-dps-gear-bis-classic-wow) You don't need to follow all the recommendations precisely and it already gives you plenty of options, but it helps to get a better understanding of what kind of gear benefits you the most.
---
I would rather be that then be a bunch of “pretty races.” Na, I want to be  BIG BEEFY COS CHARGING AT U FULL SPEED
---
Yeah it doesn't take THAT many. I did it against like 30+ alliance with 4 horde mages. We just rezed, came out of nowhere, popped shapers at the same time on the same group, and AEed till we died. 
---
You have to be paying attention to not get deleted. There's not that many classes or players that can actually deal with 3k+ damage out of nowhere in raid gear. Even with cooldowns and PvP gear on it would be a total bitch 9/10 times. It's also not something that's easy to counter when people are willing to die to fuck with you. If they coordinate through TS/discord you basically get the big day F. 
---
One tapping half of the raid will send a message and get any point across.
---
Lol, whoops, healthstone... thanks
---
pretty close with a bit of questing. we were full clearing without all the skips people do now like the window
---
So if anything it's *more* fair.
---
And they don't wanna pay the Troll toll.
---
[Nice](https://i.imgur.com/5OTmwzH.png)
---
Slowly building my 5-man instance group (warrior, priest, 2x mages and warlock). I think ill start doing SM library runs today, after i finish few odd quests to clear out some quest log space.
---
Tbh, i dont really see the point in having 5 shammys to ZAP everyone, i might do 5x warlocks later on, but thats just to get summon chars (and profession CDs). Maybe i do get into that later on, when people will eventually start attacking me more. Its not like i dont get the attention atm, get targeted, followed etc. 
---
Alliance mostly runs away, unless its a L60. I dont use the group for PVP purposes, unless provoked.
---
Yooo I took the boat today and you weren't there, was sad :(
---
Congrats! Welcome to the Rogue endgame, where PUGs are rarer than Black Lotus ;)
---
 Not level 60 still talking about rolling people. I’d say you can’t tell your ass from a hole in the ground. Get to leveling bud.
---
I LOVE STV.
---
The ganking. The grinding. The questing from 30-45...
---
Your atlasloot might not be updated. I updated mine and it shows drop source &amp; rate.
---
I prefer Grid with mouseover macros (Google those) as well as Shadowed unit frames.
---
There's a nice sword from an undercity quest that involves killing the bosses from scarlet monastery as well
---
Yeah I've never done bfd, so I didn't know about that sword, supposively can solo it at 27, I'll try it today. But if not I'll have a friend run me through it.
---
you can open all the coffers in the room, sides jump into the coffer one next to the side and open chest/door from inside the wall, make sure vanish is up for the very last one tho as the guards will agro you!
---
Au contraire, environmental kills earn bonus points.
---
Thunderclap is generally a better idea... If you are rocking a really slow hard hitting one hander (generally a bad idea for tanking) or are for some reason charging in with a 2 hander out, then sure. Otherwise use clap and demo shout. They generate threat and have the bonus effect of making you take less damage.
---
How many raid bosses do you know that can be stunned?
---
In a raid it's more like "oh he's doing less damage than the holy priest that's shadow weaving, kind of sad"
---
technically yes, last boss and mining is the big part. But  caster+imp boss takes 2min to kill on the route and you have guaranteed 1-2 herbs with \~1-3g aswell. Plus you have a spot for the red books at this boss
---
Destroying quest items usually abandons the quest also. Pick up the quest again.
---
iirc, that quest was added in cata
---
Why are you changing the subject with a brain dead response?
---
Execute doesn't scale off weapon damage very much, just switch to battle and spam it with the shield on.
---
Also get honored with your own race/city so it's 90g instead of 100g
---
AntonilzUI
---
Isnt this no longer working? I think somewhere I read that this is patched
---
Pool is closed
---
Sounds like u need to talk to that guy at SW gate (near elwyn) and tell him u ready
---
It's not about feign resist. It's when they are both after my pet and I shoot cho, magically Gordok aggros me at the exact same time. It's bugged. Did 5 runs today and I was not getting this glitch at all so I don't know what to think anymore.
---
They nerfed it because it was being abused by multiboxers and professional gold farmers to the point it started causing serious, systemic disruption to server economies. Once that starts to happen, it can get out of control very fast. You can probably find forum threads about it from back when. The ease with which accounts could be boosted for RMT was also an issue.
---
For the record, I have nothing against multiboxers; I double box. But when it gets to a point that people are racking up hundreds or thousands of gold in a few hours play, you can easily have an AH situation where server prices differ by an order of magnitude or more. That's not good for anyone.
---
Because people are treating WoW as it was back in the day when raiding was less accessible, leading to people Twinking more frequently as an end game alternative.  People who are gonna Twink have already been gearing themselves up while shit is cheaper on AH.  The other thing is that the market's probably going to be flooded by people posting their BOE's when BG's drop, without anyone to buy them (supply and demand).  If you're struggling for mount gold ATM, sell your boe's to someone way below market value so you can get your mount faster and make that gold.
---
Did this in BC for Arena. 
---
X4 Ele with Priest healer.
---
Return to the quest giver to accept the quest again. The Fragment will be provided. 
---
Wowhead is your friend: 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=6501/the-dragons-eye
---
&gt; "but the utility!" they scream as the tank dies and they don't **hoj**, 
---
Learn to read maybe? It's not hard, it's a common acronym but you still fucked it up somehow. Incredible.
---
I think the good depends on if your on the receiving end or not..
---
What did you do for him? Curse of Recklessness for Silithus boss?
---
Mining makes the material used by engineering and blacksmithing.
---
You improve engineering by making engineering things. What I'd recommend is make a bunch of parts, and then as you skill up turn those parts into things.
---
Note bombs and grenades are used up.
---
You could certainly go engineering and alchemy, and you'd be buying the materials on the auction house (which is fine, as long as you know how to sell what people want).
---
not even a pet
---
Duskwood! It’s creepy and Stitches. Need I say more?!
---
Did we just become best friends?!
---
My phone auto corrected best to beard (because I’m awful at typing) which also would have worked.
---
It just shows up when there's activity in the chat box. Fades afterwards
---
Always wanted to try making some of the AH, but that was initially a plan for lvl 60 tbh. As I thought about sound some farming first. But I guess giving it a try could be fun.
---
People giving you a hard time but it makes me think about spell batching too and how everyone wants it taking away yet the devs have done nothing?....
---
Kind of obvious when world PvP raids get lagged out and are clunky..
---
i got the trinket on the 3d drop with 2 guys helping me that already had the trinket after loosing it 2 times prior, probarly did a total of 80-100 runs
---
Any benefit from doing a double box? and what program are you using. :)
---
Stranglethorn Vale - every time spent there grants a different experience.
---
Consider yourself lucky, heals are a dime a dozen on my server.
---
ClassicAuraDurations I think is the best bet.
---
This is restrictive not creative.
---
That is true
---
Wait, you are a mage and needed on (and won) a ravager in a group with a warrior and a paladin? You are the only ninja here.
---
That's why the emphasis is &gt; good &lt; warrior.
---
Huge Geyssir can be LoSed, because your warrior brings Hydrospawn into the corner infront of  his pool. The sacrifice can be grounded, knockback by wolf can taunted midflight, imps can be AoE taunted.
---
With a good warrior, a shaman will not take damage the entirety of DM:E.
---
There should be a reset to defaults button if you think you change a binding and screwed something up. If you click feed pet, does it still work?
---
I have the complete opposite experience. Everyone is so nice in classic.
---
Blackhand's Breath iirc. There are much better defensive trinkets you can get if you need more mitigation.
---
You're doubling down so hard on being an obvious moron who made a weird point that came from you misreading the original comment.
---
&gt; The best retadin I ran with was full BiS - had SGC, hoj, etc
---
This is what you replied to and you thought he meant hammer of justice. Now you're making a weird dumb-fuck claim that one retribution paladin not *STUNNING* a boss somehow wiped the entire raid.
---
what about warrior dps and hunter dps &gt;_&gt;
---
Interesting I wonder what it goes for now
---
He broke his own rules and so did the paladin. Neither could equip it at that moment but both should’ve rolled need. The mage is a dick and the fact that you think what he did is noble is mind boggling.
---
It's not an addon actually, completely in the normal game but you have to activate it with a command.
---
/console SET chatClassColorOverride "0"
---
Type that into your chat and they will be permanently on! However, if you want shamans to be displayed as blue instead of pink, I have an addon called BlueShamans that makes them blue everywhere, including the chat
---
Mulgore and Barrens. I am in love with these zones! &lt;3
---
You're an undead rogue aren't you? All of this reads like edgy UD rogue nonsense
---
&gt; Your argument doesn't even make sense. How are they going to "hoj" aka in your eyes hand of justice, a proc.
---
So you're proving my point? How is one person's ability supposed to stop an entire raid from wiping?
---
EDIT: Damn he added a wall of text to his rant. Glad you agreed with me finally.
---
Alliance has 2 quests in Scarlet monastery, running all 4 wings would give someone level appropriate to all 4 roughly 70% of a level. And if you dont get a good group its gonna take you 5+ hours.
---
Tagging this
---
You replied to the wrong person then dumbass, read the chain you fucking moron.
---
This is what you actually replied to https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dmo56b/to_the_ret_dreamers_3/f53po8r/
---
Yeah clicking on pet feed works, but that means I have to open the interface for it. Would be a major hassle to do.
---
What was your spec in Arms? Because crit axe 2h arms is pretty dope in raids, especially if you can get a proper rage flow going.
---
Wat?
---
Absolutely loving it, grouped up with a few other low level hordes and had some pretty wild fights 4v4 6v4 etc we were usually outnumbered but we made two alliance palas bubble hearthstone out
---
lol found the mage.
---
Duskwood. It really hits the spooky vibe well and has some of the best quest chains and lore in the game.
---
How does a warrior ninja [Ravager]?
---
I think ita funny how many people complain about Spy. Its as broken as any AH or questing or spell/toolbar add on.
---
The last 3 nights has been bad for us all. Now we called the doctor again and he's going to have a check later today.
---
They already gave a hint that it might be something with the ears.
---
Usually he wakes up ever 1,5-2 hours during his night time, but has been worse and worse. And tonight he wouldn't sleep at all..
---
Hopefully he will soon be okay so its back to the usual routine.
---
You actually perfectly cut off the part you *literally* replied to just to prove a weird point again. This is hilarious.
---
We have a lot of the same keybinds. Funny that!
---
I found it annoying that many specials do not start auto attack. So I made all of mine simple macros like:
---
```
---
#showtooltip Heroic Strike
---
/startattack
---
/cast Heroic Strike
---
Life taping is good. You can heal them to full with one heal basically and you rarely have to drink as a healer anyway. Them spamming tap makes the run go faster
---
It's a racist joke. In EU, a lot of ppl tend to avoid spaniards due to their language skills. The name is based on emotes and it forms the so called "Spanish fire exit".
---
flag_es point_right door
---
yeah this shouldn't be a thing but actiblizz needs that $$$$$
---
Nice!! Have you tried 29/11/11? Interested to know how that is shaping up
---
The warrior after his armour breaks and he is obliged to pay 7g in repairs on the other hand is a saltmine!
---
Warlock is the best class in classic for Wpvp and duels. They have great burst damage, great position in most fights, great utility and versatility in their pets. Most of their CC is fear based and not on long cooldowns. 
---
They're good in BG but they lack the ability mage has to juggle multiple players. Their fear has a lot of miscellanies counters that can make things awkward. 
---
Mages are a little more polerized. They have a great matchup against most non casters and can generally beat any class if they are prepared and have cooldowns up. Their bad matchups can be overcome with trinkets and out playing.
---
They're much better in BG and Wpvp since they have unmatched CC and burst DPS. Their AOE and instant casts are generally better than really any other class too. You can easily juggle two or three mediocre players and kill them all. 
---
The trade off is as a mage you're either going to dunk on people or have to work for every 1v1 win. Entering a fight vs a lock without IB/CS up is going to be a slaughter for example. You'll always have to out play a priest/lock/ druid. You'll always have to be the better player out of the rogue vs mage matchup. You'll always "effortlessly" fuck over warriors/paladin  you open on.
---
I'm sure that guy is telling the truth, no on lies on the internet. If you do strat at 57 you're getting carried. I won't invite anyone who isn't 60 to strat or scholo. No dungeon in classic is hard, but they aren't easy.
---
Felwood is really dangerous as an ally tho, but I get your point, thanks:)
---
"Why are you changing the subject with a brain dead response?" hurr durr huuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrrrr
---
You are profoundly mentally disabled and were quite possibly born with fetal alcohol syndrome. Bless your parents hearts for letting you get on the internet.
---
My post, that you replied to but meant to reply to someone else but then DOUBLED DOWN because you can't read, was for dungeons. Now if we're talking raids ret paladins are even worse. Their damage is below garbage and they have less utility. 
---
No one likes ret paladins, they don't like them in groups, they don't like them in pvp. Rolling one is just asking to be carried so you can be a special snowflake.
---
Gotta love the wannabe forum mods. Annoying af.
---
So that is why you have the expensive Enchant recipes ;) And here I am, just trying to get by with my GinChanting :(
---
Great collection you got! Kudos to you! :)
---
That's what I already do, but I feel drained.
---
And courier if you are a crazy mofo wanting Malowns Slam.
---
Free action potion
---
Fire plume, un'goro creater.
---
Sutch a rich place. World pvp, fire elementals and rich thorium veins that i have harvested many arcane crystals.
---
Wtf is this garbage I am reading here? Them lifetapping and you healing them is the way to go. As a healer you rarely have to drink and you dont dictate the pace of the run. 
---
Its better they lifetap and you heal because it makes things faster.
---
While I do hate alliance scum, I do have to say the paladin sets look amazing
---
And not to even mention that most druids (I'd say over 95%) are resto. And for resto boots are only good item from T1. Rest are fine but there is much better options.
---
Still great job! That tier really does look good.
---
You're right, it's phase 2, my bad. (but phase 2 is not that far away :p )  
---
In phase 1, you could use something like [Cassandra's Grace](https://www.nightelfmohawk.com/db/?item=13102) (world drop), [Insightful Hood](https://vanillawowdb.com/?item=18490) (dire maul), or [Sanctified Leather Helm](https://vanillawowdb.com/?item=22689) (argent dawn rep).  
---
All of these are have more than triple the + healing of the cenarion helm.
---
I also use HealBot, it’s pretty good. I get the sense there’s a lot more customizing but the default settings work fine until raids. 
---
Another thing to learn is downranking. You don’t want to use the top rank heal every time as it eats up mana fast. You want to match hp with rank and use exactly the right mana. Too little and you spam heals (see 5 second rule). Too much and you drop mana fast. 
---
Even though it seems weird, Spirit is more important than Int because it controls mana regen. Later in deep holy you have a talent that increases your heals by 25% of spirit. 
---
And speaking of talents, many people start with 5 spirit tap and 5 wand specialization so you can wand down mobs if you’re solo questing as holy. Even though those aren’t the best use of 10 for deep holy.
---
Lots of guides out there. Good luck!
---
That's a massive yikes. Imagine being this mad over a video game. You must be such an angry person in real life.
---
It was more to make sure that the actual spell was working. I’d reset my bindings to default and start over.
---
Can you do me a huge solid and look up the word predicated? Thanks tiger.
---
Edit: I'll make it easier for you to read since you're having trouble.
---
&gt;If your (the ret paladin's) group is fine with carrying you and putting in all the work then good on them.
---
I just seen that too, 30 hrs, thats a shame, gonna get WoW
---
He didn't make 6k tho.
---
Let's say I buy a piece of gear for 100g and sell it for 120g
---
I made 20g but the add-on will say 120g
---
&gt; But I've never really wanted anything except to have fun with people I like. Other people just want to have fun with people who have money. I don't want to get money. I don't want to compete. I want to cooperate.
---
Literally me. It feels pointless and I fear I cannot change because how can you change when you don't want to.
---
You missed the part where the warrior was setting rules to essentially force gear to himself and broken said rules. Basically another "literally everything is reserved lfm" run.
---
Yeah it's a dick move, but people should learn to follow rules if they're going to set them like that.
---
Nah not really,
---
Multishots do slightly less damage and you wont be able to weave aimedshots inbetwen autoattacks.
---
So not a huge difference and not a problem at all.
---
Buy beaststalker, its like 2gold on AH.
---
or make fun, high skill cap pvp for infinite fun, like guild wars 1
---
Yah lol, wtf. That damage is insanely low. I'm hitting for like 180 or so all the time with HoJ as a prot tank, not even amazing gear. When I crit, which is often with like 15%, I am hitting for over 300
---
Don’t be in melee range on Lava Reavers, just makes your healers oom
---
My in game name is Danno as well, was confused for a second. Obiviously different servers though
---
Ashenvale, it's the best place to fish and just chill in general.
---
There's an option to enable those pop-out windows in the settings of Classic but GM messages by default are whispers. But they still have the Blizz logo next to their name.
---
I played for 3 hours yesterday and had 2 corpseruns...I don't see how that should help me. :)
---
Also Warrior. It  gets better after 40 :D
---
Shazzrah has no druids. Our guild has 2. Both of which are absolutely stacked with gear after 3 raid clears of MC and ony.
---
21/30/0 is best for solo PVP. Entrapment/survival builds are good in premade BGs. Full MM is solid  all around and is also your raiding spec obviously.

Hi, /u/jhwj9617

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dmtijr/how_to_show_healing_numbers_is_it_an_addon/). 
---
How is trolling someone adding anything either? It's not.
---
Only 1 bank alt? I’m definitely a hoarder
---
My guild has two Ret Paladins and we just cleared all of MC in like 2 hours 30 minutes for the second week in a row. The Ret Paladins hover between #10 and #16 on the DPS meters and will often be above some of the other DPS classes due to deaths or mechanics issues. I guess if everyone played perfectly they'd be lower down but it's not like the Ret Paladins are slowing us down. 
---
They will often throw on healing gear for Barron Geddon and Shazzrah since they're not super melee friendly.
---
On the other hand, between the two Rets and our Holy healers, every single Raid member constantly has Might, Wisdom, Kings and Salvation, plus auras.
---
Seems like Paladin is in a pretty good spot in Classic, to me.
---
And TBF before DM released all the hunters rolling on HoJ were absolutely right, that shit is their pre-bis trinket too. Yeah the chance to have an extra white hit is wasted on them but show me a better trinket (Pre-Dire Maul) than free 20 AP. 
---
And im saying this as a rogue who has seen exactly 1 HoJ and lost it to a rogue. I wasnt happy, but it wasnt because of their class
---
This was great. I'm tempted to open a guild named ferns on Lakeshire too, to spread the diversity (more Nazis on German servers?)
---
And I don't even have sounds... Need to watch that again when I have...
---
I thought hit cap was 6% for pvp and 9% for pve. Is that not correct?
---
Any chance at a screenshot of your whole layout?
---
Ashenvale. The contrast to barrens, and the feel of a high fantasy forest... That's when I got hooked
---
More like.. “sorry guys I’d love to help but I can’t” (meanwhile afking xd)
---
You haven't added anything of value to the discussion besides rage and insults so we could leave it at that if you want and you can go calm down.
---
I tried it. Doesn't work. In party is more exp
---
For sure about Serpent Sting, but I think it does not for the weapon and pet
---
It's not that dumb if the other gear is good 
---
If you're commenting I'm sure you know but hit chance passed the yellow cap is only impacting autos. It's pretty easy to think about how much damage this is worth - hit chance added * how much of your damage is white 
---
For rogues that's a decent amount of damage, but depending on your gear that hit% could now be only half as good as crit. 
---
However, there aren't many good alternative gearing options anyway. Imo the only reason you would stray away from standard pre bis is for 6/8 shadow craft - but then you'd only want this if you weren't gonna raid much because getting one piece of raid gear can nuke the whole point of sc gear.
---
I actually had a guild enhancement shaman ask me to tank arena/anger runs and ask me not to roll on HoJ if it dropped. I'm a fury warrior. I tank shit for the guild regularly and still haven't got my HoJ, would of tanked it for him gladly and rolled against him. 
---
I suddenly had something important to do, and it definitely wasn't helping get an enhancement shaman a HoJ reserve run. People are just completely blind to what selfish assholes they are.
---
Pay the tank. Group is easy to form. I would run 5 runs for 25g no problem, and I have HoJ already
---
Orgrimmar
---
Can I tank strat/scholo/lbrs/ubrs as fury dps spec with defense gear and shield?
---
Loch modan, just a pretty zone that reminds me of home.
---
A good reason to move over?  You just said you preferred classic. Is that not reason enough?
---
so perfect
---
We have a system in our guild where 1 meme specc is allowed. Everyone knows this when they sign up. That doesn't make the people who run these specs selfish when it was agreed upon.
---
If you absolutely don't want Paladin, Priest or Druid to DPS, tell Blizzard to completely remove the ability to do it.
---
Calling people selfish because they're having fun with their guild makes way less sense to me. But to each their own.
---
I used to smoke 2-3 grams a day and it costed a fortune. I quit completely recently. The change in my behaviour was dramatic; smoking that much weed and for so long made me a ‘cooperative’ but unmotivated, lazy person. Any ambitions I had disappeared during that time. In retrospect, it feels like I lost 2 years of my life. Days, weeks and months seemed to slip by and I’d just sit in my bedroom and try numb my depression with joint after joint. It’s such a harmless drug at first and it’s so easy to fool yourself into thinking it’s not fucking you sure over, especially with all this pro weed sentiment going around these days. But if you’re depressed or anxious weed isn’t a solution in my experience; all it does is postpone your emotions until it reaches a tipping point and weed isn’t enough. 
---
I’d strongly recommend flushing down any weed you have, destroying your bongs, joint rolling papers and filters. Delete your dealers number, make it as hard as possible for you to acquire more. Do it when you think you’re ready; but I believe that cold turkey is the only way.
---
There are no  serious physical withdrawals, the issue is really purely psychological.
---
Of course this is only my experience and so I don’t even know if weed is the main issue for you but I will say that any psychiatrist worth a penny will tell you that self medicating with copious amounts of weed is not going to help your mental state.
---
I haven't seen this at all on my server, still plenty of LF healer in the LFG channel and I see raid guilds recruiting for them constantly.
---
3 grams is 46.29 grains
---
^^^[WHY](/r/UselessConversionBot/comments/1knas0/hi_im_useless/)
---
Yes.
---
looks dead for dreadmist Ogg, it was making my machine drop frames last night, felt like old times.
---
Yes I'm horde. According to the last census (before it got disabled) and our discord, the ration between dps and heal is about 2:1. On alliance side, it was even worse with about 30% of all player being heal. Not that bad during leveling, as most won't be heal specced, but at 50+ your are really starting to feel the imbalance. In the usual channels, it is normal to see groups looking for dps+tank (or just tank ofc) or single healers looking for a group.
---
Grats seen you in if with it yesterday. the feeling now must be great :)
---
My friends and I transfered to Bloodfang from Gehennas and none of us regret it one bit. You're very welcome!
---
Which build are you using? Seems like you have Improved CoC but also very deep in the fire tree so I’m rather curious!
---
Ah, the "disgust them into leaving you alone" tactic.
---
Haha had a good laugh - good job!   :)
---
And what have you come in here and graced us mortals with? Tell me what I should be thanking god for that you have given us. This holy grail of discussion topics and veritable cornucopia of information you have seen fit to bless us worms with.
---
I've been level 59,83 for about a month now. Might have something to do with this
---
Report them all they will eventually get punished.
---
Ooooo I know someone on the other side now neat :) what level is your lock?
---
It's really incredible how many DPS (especially mages) don't realize you can switch targets and stop hitting the mob you're about to threat on.
---
I even play a hybrid with hybrid spec!
---
0/22/29 shaman. Works like a charm!
---
A tactic pioneered by [Thrall himself.](https://youtu.be/mUNFrbpOSTE?t=1093)
---
Maybe its a difference between pvp vs pve servers, I'm on pve.
---
Never knew Mages could also be White Knights. Disgusting stuff right here.
---
Pre-raid bis for Ret is to go and respec Holy.
---
Jokes aside, [this site](http://www.wowclassicbis.com/) has some pretty decent bis lists for all classes. It doesn't provide alternative options though, unless you count older phases, but that isn't very relevant yet.
---
Welcome to our realm :)
---
yeah, that's what I'm wondering. 7 extra damage after 15 seconds isn't really enough to justify it, but if the pet spells or the procs somehow work that'd be great. I'd be willing to test it, but it's pretty hard with damage variance, rare proc chance and resistances.
---
Is this against tos?
---
Yeah we did 20 tonight, most groups were actually 3 stack, but it worked just fine.  Easy 1 phase 1 shot.
---
Report them. Blizzard is taking rooftop camping serious
---
imagine some guy running up to you and screaming "SKINNING!?" at the top of their lungs...
---
Tell them to go die and use the other entrance as ghost.
---
Still at 42 lol. Funny because it's the level you can enter DM but when I applied as dps for a group I got instantly removed...
---
I did zf with 2 warriors, a mage and me (warrior), plus a healer priest. Single target was a bit slow, AoE was brutal, and managed to stay alive in some dangerous overpulls (6+ mobs)  by... Well, having 3 guys wearing plate taunting all the mobs around
---
WE NEED TO GO DEEPER LEO
---
Life as a pure DPS can be hard. However, DPS warriors, priests, druids and palas should find a group anytime with their tank or heal offspecs. And if they don't, it is their own fault. You should always have your offspec set with you. As a 2h fury warrior I tanked all high level dungeons easily and found groups in no time. If I insisted on doing DPS it would have been another story. Yesterday I joined a group looking for arena/anger/golem runs and in there werr a 58 fury warrior and 60 arms warrior. I left right there, since it tells me they suck. You can literally tank any dungeon pack in any dungeon until ubrs without a shield with decent heal. I mostly put out most damage on thrash mobs and easy bosses or I am close second behind mages. Mobs drop in no time. I just bother wearing a shield and tank gear for hard bosses like baron. All you need is a decent mage and good heal and any dungron becomes a breeze.

WELCOME TO THE THUNDERDOME BITCH!!!!
---
It’s the ‘having fun in the meantime’ bit I guess - the game has gone from being a source of fun to being an obligation that they are relieved to have off their back for a while. I’ve definitely been there with WoW and other games in the past, where I basically had to force myself to play because I needed to, and its such a toxic mindset, we have enough obligations and slogs to get through outside of games / hobbies / fun.

You can't beat Duskwood. The doom and gloom vibe and enclosed canopy above. It's the quintessential Halloween vibe littered with cemeteries, creepy caves, manors and a massive crypt. It's an eternal creepy zone that will always be my favorite and I almost rolled alliance just to experience the zone for Classic.
---
Can’t make up my mind if we need to go deeper or nerd ter ger derper
---
still at 42 lol (but today I will surely hit 43 after work since I will be able to play at least 6 hours nonstop)
---
Wait what really?
---
I've done 6 live runs all with different groups, everyone used the front entrance
---
I (Horde) was between attempts, eating food buffs and preparing myself, when an alliance paladin came by. He stopped looked at the demon and then went at it ... and got one-shot instantly. I've laughed so hard :)  
---
I hope he learned to keep his nose out of trouble.
---
I'll try to test for it. not sure what the best way is though. Maybe target dummies?

He means it's nice in PvP despite giving him too much hit, because the other talents are good.

You can use class buffs, healthstones, potions. 2 of them can benefit from having people helping in other ways, too. The winterspring one is nice to have people clearing adds out of your kiting path, and the silithus one it's nice to have a warlock dueling you for curse of recklessness.

Haven't tried classigLFG but puggle is pretty great. You can rate your group members, add general notes for players and for run. Also has timer how long the group advertisement has been up (like they been looking for tank for past 15 minutes).
---
I have lot of 5/5 people in the list and it's easy to also look what groups you were in last (adds all parties so even those not in instance! So maybe remind yourself of that amazing quest-helper buddy!)
---
Gz! Now the real grind starts🙌🏻
---
Oooh, shit yea it probably is the PvE thing. I'm super lucky to be in a guild that's not oversized and likes to grp as often as possible, so that helps a ton too.

i realy need those 2 ghost wolf talant points :P

I play on max settings and even then its very difficult to find some herbs.
---
Sometimes I just swipe my mouse slowly from left to right until the button lights up, its crazy
---
It makes sense, late game the majority of 3/8 available classes are healers. So when only 1/5th of the party has to be healer, but almost half of the population are healers then there will be a surplus of healers.
---
The funny thing is that it shifts for raids. I feel like a king regarding tanking in the 60's dungeons, but 90% of raid searches don't need tanks anymore, but mostly DPS.
---
Downvote me before you even check it. kek

Nice ninja edit btw, I don't gaf if ret a paladin steals leather. They're not in my groups lmfao

I'm not sure, but it looks like Luna.

Hilarious. Simply hilarious.

I am stupified as to why anyone would willingly raid with these idiots.
---
A guild full of WoW Classic Kardashians only there to get on stream.

awesome, comment to find it later \^\^
---
Dude you don't get it.
---
The perfect raid just doesn't have Paladins and Druids.
---
And it makes everything go so smooth /s
---
Shadowfang Keep, ofc! So many well hidden treasures lurking in there. \^\^
---

---
Truefaith Vestments and +30sp to wep.
---
I fully agree, just make the entire raid a cold blooded dagger spec and one shot the bosses on opener, duh.
---
I get that but changes nothing about what I said. Duels are prep for PvP. Limiting what can be used is doing yourself a disservice when you meet that class in open world PvP. How can you prep for a warrior when you never learn how to combat his 30 min cd? Or the pots that an alchemist will inevitably use? Or anything else that you remove by putting limitations on it?
---
Why not use the shortcut jump? It's easy, and even if you miss and jump direct into lava you wont die cause ledge is like 2 jumps away..
---
Ok.,,right, the noises were nice too. I guess that if it was so bad I would not have the tillers rep then, I actually am pleased I have to land there for the Pet Master in the Pandaria daily tour 😊😊
---
I leveled from about 55 to 58 just healing groups spamming the first three bosses in LBRS.
---
Seemed like there was always two or three groups doing that. Might be less popular now with people opting for Satyr's Bow over Blackcrow, I guess.
---
Oh if only people had given me 2-3s for building aggro on the pulls I wouldn't have given up on tanking dungeons.
---
Now I just tank for my guild, for PUGs I'll be dps warrior only and let another one take the blame.
---
The problem with minmaxing people is that attitude will condemn them to be playing alone in a few months. A new tank has a hard time learning how to tank because, even if he says he's learning, even though the party had been looking for tank for 20 min., They will still be complaining and charging the mobs 0.001s after you land your first hit.
---
Uh wtb a balance druid in our raid for crit buff. Our druids respec out of balance or feral because they aren't top numbers not realising what they bring to the raid instead. Makes me so sad.
---
Ironforge / Orgrimmar. Too many great memories of dueling outside of the gates while waiting for BGs or just hanging and laughing with friends.
---
You’re spitting straight facts here; I wish people took these issues more seriously. I hate the happy go lucky attitude people take towards weed in particular. It really can become a dangerous addiction; perhaps not physically or directly but it can trick you into being content with your sadness.
---
I had an ele shaman in my group the other day. He did okay damage and stayed on par with everybody else. I'd say our dungeon run was pretty smooth.
---
Can't say the same for every spec though...
---
Thanks, I'll try it out.
---
Sounds dead as fuck

Err 1.5g per ore? They are 10 silver on most servers, that’s probably why your gph is so high.

I don’t get that mentality. Legit it’s like giving someone a molten hunk of lava and saying, “ hey this lava is hot. “ and they’re fucking hands have melted to the bone and they’re like, “ NO, I CANT FEEL ANYTHING, ITS NOT HOT. “

As a fellow troll it saddens me that this isn't happening on a EU server. The only thing I would change would be to put all Gnomes as kill on sight, go back to Gnomeregan! Spirits be with ya mon!
---
Hail brother.
---
I feel like your being purposely obtuse. Downranking doesn’t mean you ONLY use downranked spells. Healing power gives you both better healing throughout when needed with max rank heals and better efficiency when needed by using mana efficient downranked heals.
---
You still get Lenny if int and mama regen even when stacking healing power gear unless you are literally just buying greens off the ah

---
Hey!
---
I use details! For damage - will I be able to find the HoJ damage in there? I've been trying to figure out how much damage it ads, because I've not seen significant gains since I have it.
---
You're genuinely one of the saddest people I've seen on Reddit btw. Your responses are that of a 14-year-old. I hope that's what you are and not someone in their thirties crying this much about a video game.

Pretty petty. Grow up.

You guys ever tried out OSRS?

thanks

ok, i have similar question

i have mining and skinning rn but I intend to switch skinning-&gt;engi later
---
should I ever bank and store any low level mats from mining for my engi leveling later on? (I mean things like tin/silver/iron stuff etc)
---
Thanks. I looked on shadow, but it just showed like lvls 48+ weapons. Maybe I looked at the wrong link. 
---
 But this is what I was looking for. Thanks brotha
---
Pyrewood Village still layered then 😒
---
I think it's two fold.  One, there's many many fold more guilds full clearing MC.   Two, blizzard is giving streamers legendaries.
---
How does it look? 
---
Is it that blueish effect around the feet? Or is that something else?
---
Yea sometimes we don’t even get water and int buff.  :(
---
Exactly. Other people who get out of my position feel motivated enough that they would rather do whatever is needed to be done to achieve whatever result their looking for. Lying down and waiting to die is literally more appealing to me. And some people don't understand how that could be a mental illness. Sounds pretty wack to me.
---
I'm sure that Party is fine with it
---
This is what our guild and guild members have agreed to. If you think that's selfish, that's on you. No one is min-maxing this game in Phase 1 and no one in our guild gives a shit about 'parse scores'.
---
Forcing that on people is selfish.

This is the spec that both the hunters in our premades and the hunters on the other faction used as their PvP specs back when we played private servers. It's really annoying to go up against.

I can't find the post now but I have this memory that it was said that legendary drop rates were borked in most of vanilla due to some fuck up with a neck dropping that shouldn't have. 
---
Could it be blizz just set the right rate from the start this time?
---
Love how you let the **69** copper exist in the slow mo.
---
Should I buy devilsaur legs and gauntlets directly of AH instead of letting it get crafted?
---
Some one in my guild can craft it for me without fee. But I calculated all the materials from the AH and came to a total of 221g50s. But the legs are currently 130g and the gauntlets are 68g directly from AH. Which is only 198g in total.
---
How is this possible?
---
&gt;Another thing to learn is downranking. You don’t want to use the top rank heal every time as it eats up mana fast. You want to match hp with rank and use exactly the right mana. Too little and you spam heals (see 5 second rule). Too much and you drop mana fast. 
---
I dont think it matters before you are around 60 with decent gear, you downrank because lower ranks start to be more mana efficient when you have +healing etc but having several ranks of the same heal for different situation is plain stupid, even without that as a priest you have like 20 keybinds you use on daily basis
---
Because some people can't be bothered with the AH, possibly having to list the item several times and all that jazz. It is like in real life. You get a middle man that gets a cut, but saves you some effort and takes the risk of something going wrong.
---
At a 5 gold margin it is probably just a case of people not being very knowledgeable, but on most servers the difference is smaller and once you failed to sell once or twice there isn't a lot of profit left.
---
Gz. I got to max level like 2 days ago. Had a lot of rested xp. Now to find time to play the game.
---
&gt;!this is moardotzz. i was the train conductor!&lt;
---
I bet the average gold a player has on a korean server is significantly higher then on western servers :D so there might be an inflation
---
I know there is a respawn tracker add-on or something like this but couldn't find. Can someone link me?
---
You had me in the first half, ngl.
---
I can see three horde traitors tho.
---
it was BiS for it's 20AP, which is almost nothing, might as well not have anything equipped almost, while for melee who actually, you know, use the proc that is the most important part of the item, it's far more valuable.  a hunter who needs HoJ when someone else in the group does, is pure human trash imo. Also fuck this "BiS only" mentality, use some common sense. 
---
Same would go for example for rogues and warriors taking Blackcrow from Hunters - it's BiS for both, but for rogue and warrior its just a stat stick while hunter gains far more value from it.
---
Can be done easy with enough tanks in raid.
---
The one I saw was from tbc prepatch with 41 talents.
---
Flasks required -50dkp per 5 mins late
---
Your class leader is a moron. If Warrior DM trinket was 2% hit you best believe I'd use that over HoJ as Fury.
---
You could try making some macros to consolidate your spell bar. On my shaman I went from almost full action bars to being able to hide the 2 side bars.
---
You've put into words what I've been feeling for the last 10 years but can never say to anyone I know. If there's any comfort I can give and take from this conversation, it's that we're not alone.
---
Yea saw it. Its really fucked up situation. Face expression of Savix says it all. Felt bad for him, maybe he can make his own group and do a chill lead.

Do you do competitive dps in raids? DPS in dungeons doesn't matter at all.
---
Upvote for parachute cloak
---
Not sure if it's an option, depending on your server, but on mine it's pretty easy to buy a boost for HoJ runs, i.e. guaranteeing that you get the drop. I paid a 100g flat fee on drop - took 49 runs. I'd probably kill myself if I had to roll on it after running 49 times.

I second this. Did two farm groups. Both times organized them, took along:

Druid tanks that need the ring from golemlord 
---
Healers that need golemlord
---
Mage + hunter that need things from arena, especially the epic chest piece. 
---
And you're good to go!

You can’t have both factions on a pvp server.

And my reply is still the same; I have no idea what happened as I took the screen, but you can see the boots are highlighted. It's just that the cursor somehow jumped
---
Yes I do it in raid aswell
---
Yeah that's part of bad design back in vanilla... in dungeon you need 1 out of 5 players to be a tank, in raids its 2 out of 40
---
I read somewhere that if you take frost runes from Naxxramas, you will get saved. It could work the same with mining Dark Iron ore.
---
You are the pendulum. You have swung one way and now you swing another. **RNGesus be with you.**
---
Well I've done like 7 runs and saw a book by her sooo think that's wrong.
---
10s? wow... thank god that's not our case lol
---
But I dun want eet!
---
I dunno - I fear in a low pop realm unless you play only during "peak hours" your experience will be shit.
---
I use grid + clique for mouseover healing and it works great
---
Well we have a ret paladin in the guild (officer privilege) and they don't do competitive damage like at all. Usually below tanks on the meters. That said, it doesn't matter as we still clear MC in a few hours with 30 people... but if you took for example 5 or more of such shitty dps, you might actually have some problems.
---
I know, I pointed out what helps dealing with Rogue. Rogue is based on stunlocks, FAP will give you like 20 s of immunity to stuns? There will be LAP and PvP trinkets as well to counter working stuns if you get ambushed. It doesn't work with blind though but blind lasts 10 s. The only way to CC you once you use FAP then will be 2x blind then stunlocking. Not everyone is specced for that though.
---
Not an RP server, btw, just regular PVP
---
Out dps warrs and rogs? The afk ones?
---
How on earth are you outperforming anyone with that spec? MC fights are perfect for Adren. Rush.
---
Sorry but I don't believe this. Logs/screenshots of your raids damage?
---
It is also influences by dire mail releating.
---
Skipped it entirely. No regrets.
---
It also be noted that even via e-mail, Blizzard wouldn't ask you to go to a website to "verify your details" otherwise they will suspend your account. There are a lot of fake e-mails like that from "blizzard" asking you to give your account or credit card details.
---
I think HoJ is kinda shitty now because not most people are geared enough for it yet. It scales very well
---
yes
---
Really good for PvP though!
---
That’s incredibly selfish, that guys a total tool. If he isn’t pulling competent dps he needs to fix it or go holy, absolutely no reason officer or not that should be acceptable.
---
Again this isn’t a spec issue, it’s a player issue — we have 3 rets in our guild pulling 400+/1:30 min fights. That’s a solid dps mark considering most of our rogues and fury warriors are touching 450-500 dps.
---
If this guy can’t top 300, you have a major issue.
---
Horde squad getting ready for another fair 10v2 fight versus the alliance.
---
Yeah I'm on kurinaxx too, I have reported a few of these tools. 
---
 Even had cross faction collusion killing going on one day. 
---
 Both factions hanging out on top the inn ganking folks. Like wtf lol.  Reported.
---
I was 11/5/35 but switched to a 17/3/31 build once my gear improved.
---
You passively make 4g/day from mooncloth transmute
---
You can definitely play whatever you want, but you also cant complain that other players play how they want. I like playing very min/max'd and to play with others of the same mentality.
---
I will not invite a boomkin into my group or raid over a mage. I wont invite a ret pally over a warrior or rogue. 
---
I have no hate for people that want to play those classes, I jsut dont want them in my group.
---
It doesn't matter, the druid set sucks balls. A lot of peices are worse than the pre raid BiS. It might be useful in PvP however there is plenty of time for everyone to be in T1 before BG's drop. I guess it looks good sitting in Orgrimmar if that's your thing.
---
can you send me a link to it? ways curious about shaman builds when I hit 60
---
It has nothing to do with min maxing. It is selfish. Period the end.
---
The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.
---
That’s perfectly fine and acceptable, this topic is more in reference to those who overbearingly try to tell others how to play when not involved in their circle of influence.
---
Yep. It doesn't even get much better in TBC once you are past Karazhan. It's 2 out of 25 then, but it's always really just 2. In Vanilla, there are at least a lot of encounters where you need a third or even fourth tank, and very few encounters that are tight DPS races, so you can usually bring another prot and/or feral along. The tank situation only really got better with WotLK and 10 man raids.
---
Stuff changed. People are feeling more confident to heal and think they can find a group more easily. In fact now we have too many of them.
---
I've heard this 100 times. I cant for wait for people to stop being so basic and you some fresh insults.
---
Basically it's the addon setup from frostadamus, look it up on YouTube
---
An addon that lets you know if you're bring targeted without you targeting them would be cheating lol. Imagine questing in StV when you suddenly get a popup saying "You're being targeted by HordegankerXXX"
---
It's really not mandatory to level it 2 times for both spec items. Stop following the stupid guides. You are not even on a PvP server, just choose the one that helps more in PvE....
---
And now we have mechagnomes.
---
I actually play Rogue atm just cba to change it, not that it matters.
---
And yes, I know the basic rules but stating very clear rules and breaking them regardless of what they are is just asking for trouble, especially when the pally said prior that the warrior shouldn't be able to roll, I'm guessing there was a clear view that the warrior was a tank MS and not just a DPS tanking.
---
I find finding groups that want Jed is harder and harder every time...
---
Not entirely sure what scenario you are talking about but I will try to answer! So there are two positions you jump in between: water &amp; ledge. There are two pillars you want to kite him in between: middle pillar (where I stand in the video) and the far end pillar.   
---
If you are standing on the ledge, with Hydrospawn up on the ledge and you jump down in the water he will go all the way to the far pillar and back to you.  
---
If you are standing in the water, with Hydrospawn in the water and you jump up on the ledge he will jump up on the ledge too without taking the long path.   
---
So when you jump down in the water he will take longer path than when you jump up on the ledge. Let me know if this answered your question!
---
Azshara
---
No he can't, stop talking out of your ass. This mob will instantly kill anyone who is not a hunter with insane untankable damage. I've seen a bunch of people get too close to it after I reset the demon for another try and they just instantly blow up other players as soon as they aggro it. If someone attacks the demon while the hunter is tanking it then it will instantly despawn.
---
Is it in classic?
---
Nat Pagle is the quest giver. I recommend googling a fishing/cooking guide to do it simultaneously. Nat pagle gives the 225 quest south east in Dustwallow marsh out on a small island in the water.
---
no you didnt
---
Winterspring, because of snow and even has a hot spring
---
Can confirm, its even rough finding things to do on a full server after midnight eastern time.  Couldn't imagine transferring to a dead server as a graveyard worker.
---
My pets name was iKeepGrowlOn or ImWithStupid
---
You must have it easy, even our Shadowpriest is doing 375 avg. On all bosses. Topping at 477 DPS on Golemagg. 
---
Not a neckbeard just because we dont want to spend 4-5 hours in MC.
---
While I agree with some of what you are saying I suspect the potential to migrate again will be there in the future, so if your server dies out you could just move?
---
Orrrr is it just the much more likely option that streamers are usually the center of their guild so their guild will give them said legendaries, and said guild as have been clearing MC every week for longer than most guilds. Also streamers are ofc public. There’s probably been hundreds guilds/pugs that have gotten legendary drops that no one outside the group will know about.
---
It's under "more resources" and then Main Hand Progression chart - http://shadowpanther.net/mainhand.htm

I'll heal, am druid

https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/character/us/herod/obese
---
I'm guessing this is him, definitely not outperforming other rogues in his guild and pretty average logs overall.
---
We did 117 runs for 3 HOJ total. It sucked, but you just have no other choice.
---
My MTG in middle school had a teacher who kept Ana gels deck because the magic clubs at other schools had been accused of satanism. People are fuckin wierd man.
---
strength and stamina for ret should be priority during leveling
---
bears occupy wall street
---
Remember when everyone who played vanilla sucked ass at it for like a full year?
---
People shit posting around like it was easy to get to 60, find a competent raid guild on your server, kill bosses, bosses drop loot X loot 1% of the time.
---
Shut the fuck up.
---
We were NOOOBS!
---
Everyone knows how to play vanilla.
---
More boss kills means more drops. 
---
It happens. 
---
Don't be jelly.
---
This is absolutely not true for humans
---
V A N I S H ? Turns out that those 20 seconds doesn't mean anything.
---
On a side note, how do you get the steppes demon to just stand still forever and oneshot anyone passing by with a huge ass nova?
---
Un’goro cause I’m GREENch
---
I might do that, except that it's 15 on my server :)
---
Well, it's still happening. Period the end.
---
If he is a hunter it works with ffa loot. No need to be insulting
---
Meanwhile were Clearing MC since week 3, not seeing Eye of Sulfuras, any Binding, ANY RECIPE (Spellpower, Healing Power, Lionheart ...), no 1h/2h weapon, only 1 mageblade ...
---
But hey 3x Vendorstrike and 3x the shadow damage dagger :)
---
Warrior can be tank ms and ravager is still bis for him. Since both were too low level to equip it would be offspec roll meaning that both roll need. Just random idiot mage decided to offspec roll on 2h axe.
---
But class distribution is not even, there's more dps players than healers.
---
min maxing is fun
---
That’s insanity! Really shows the difference in eastern and western gamers. Once I hit softcap in bdo I dropped it entirely
---
Make sure your Pet does a bit of dmg (100 ish) on gordok and he never goes for you after a feign
---
I can appreciate that view, always try to break the celling.
---
It'll be there until you Ret pallies stop claiming you're outDPSing warriors and rogues.
---
You aren't.
---
A rogue and warrior giving the same effort as you will outDPS you every single time even with worse gear.
---
Yeah when he's in the water and I jump on the ledge to send him moving the other direction he comes up on the ledge and then starts meleeing so then I jump in the water to send him back and he usually runs behind me the short way and ruins the run. I've having trouble with him jumping up onto the ledge at the pillar with me when I go from water to ledge and me not being able to send him back down towards the 2nd pillar
---
What about booty bay? It doesn't take any tricky jumps to get on top of the mast.
---
Some people tunnel vision based on their role.
---
nice

https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/statistics/1000

Median for ret pally is 26, median for warrior is 50.
---
At the 95th percentile, pally is at 47, warrior is 97, rogue is 94.
---
Weakauras
---
Yeah you should have first aid on every toon since it's not a primary Prof. It's basically free to train besides the book you need to go above 150
---
I'm fury/prot. Can't tank this raid? It's cool I'll dps it. Need a tank for your dungeon? I got u
---
Yeah it is lol. Most people skipping on epic mount entirely, need that gear! I'm an American living here, very used to standard guild raiding. This place is nuts. I'm the GM of a 100 person guild, about 40% foreigners living in Korea like myself and the rest fluent in English Koreans. Still we have to use GDKP otherwise we could never pick up pugs and it's too big of a change for half the guild. Sometimes feels like we're just trading gold around each other but whatever.. when in rome right?
---
im alliance, human, running with 313/313 2h Swords rn. :D
---
Here's to hoping of a full-cast all-star voice-acting team consisting of Tom Hanks, Andy Serkins and Ian McKellen in the near future, alas until then, I'm stuck doing it all myself.
---
B-but muh MELEE trinket.
---
Hero to give turtle meat. It's quest item. &lt;3
---
Voone's all the way - Trueaim will give you just a little bit over 2% hit and keep in mind that weapon skill does not offer much more than that for hunters. Since as a hunter you are only interesting in getting full 9% for MC, the additional .xx% hit from the weapon skill will not matter at all. On a sidenote, hit rating for MC fights (except for Magmadar) is not that important and you'll benefit much more from more crit and a 17/31/3 spec, ignoring the hit from surefooted.
---
31/20 Arms/Fury, the normal spec. used blade spec thru OEB tho
---
&gt; Seriously, some of you need to learn basic human etiquette. 
---
This is the crux of it.  Logically, these types of people are rarely wrong.  But morally and in a frame of reference of ettiquette?  Completely out there.  It's infuriating but I often think it's because a lot of the times MMOs draw in socially reclused people.
---
They don't need to be on the quest for it? I thought that was a thing.
---
Theyre boe, buy them :P
---
I usually don't, but two things make me do that: If the damage is so spiky that waiting for a gcd risks someone dying, and if I pull aggro by dpsing. Non-priests also have to be in melee to do free damage, which can be risky.
---
You’re arguing over stacked raids with 30 second encounters where obviously warriors are going to exceedingly skew dps numbers with recklessness parses. 
---
Logs are such a poor metric right now due to the trivialization of MC raid tier. 
---
It’s the same reason boomkins have 800-1k dps parses, they don’t do that kind of damage but frontloading dps on sub 45 second fights allows for that.
---
Gonna ask my question again as people just kept telling me it's not worth the XP which I am well aware. Thats not my question.
---
Are hunters good at boosting lowbies at 60? Talking like dungeon runs while the lowbies sit at the back while you mass kill mobs. I know pally is good at this, but what about hunter?
---
Blue Items ? Warlocks wear green Boots / Bracer / Cloak :P
---
"***The Ice Tea Troll Village***" next to the ***Dancing Troll Village***.
---
When I first started to play WoW I was in this guild called the Divine Hand, Gullible 12 y/o me ate up everything they told me about the game universe, I mean why would your guildies lie? Everyone, guild master and officers all convinced me there was such a village of trolls called the Ice Tea Troll Village, where they sipped on ice teas and even sold you a unique drink; ice tea. To add validity to their story, they said that the village was next to the Dancing Troll Village. 
---
So with the help of a very friendly officer mage, and a very sly priestly officer I began the epic trek to get this Ice Tea. Scaling the cliffs of Winterspring, slow falling, missing the next cliff and having a priest revive you was all fun and games until we reached our destination. There it was, beautiful, I was about to buy an inventory stacked of Ice Tea. 
---
Rather quickly I learnt there was no Ice Tea, but somehow I didn't really care. Making new friends and the story of a journey was more important to me in the end. This is how I fell in love with this game. WoW to me wasn't just a game, it was a community. When the Divine Hand disbanded, Jadeth, our GM wrote us each personalised letters of memories we all had together with the guild and mine was about this.
---
Thanks Jadeth, you're the reason I still play today.
---
TL;DR 12 y/o me was tricked into thinking there was an Ice Tea Troll Village that neighboured the Dancing Troll Village. My guildies promised me there was Ice Tea. There was no Ice Tea.
---
Druids are fine levelers, top 4 or 3 
---
But i dont want to be a druid, no matter how much gear i get :P
---
Mage: Frostbolt
---
Hunter: Serpent Sting - Arcane Shot
---
Druid: Claw - Ferocious Bite / Starfire
---
Priest: Wand
---
Warrior: Heroic Strike - Execute
---
Warlock: Shadowbolt
---
Rogue: Sinister Strike - Slice &amp; Dice/Evicerate
---
Shaman: Stormstrike/Lightning Bolt - Earth Shock
---
Paladin: Seal of Command - Judgement
---
All classes are simple and all of them can be played with a single macro in pitched battles, playing them optimally in chaotic circumstances is entirely different, and the potential classes have with all their abilities allow for much better success, like a mage being able to kill 10+ mobs at a time with AoE kiting and cooldown / cc management, Hunters being able to solo dungeon bosses with threat drop mechanics, Paladins being able to AoE farm undead mobs with similar success to Mages but with far less risk of one mistake messing up the entire fight ect. Rotations don't exist in classic, just a standard priority system.
---
Wow so much higher than my server :D the price of leather fluctuates.i guess some days the mats will be cheaper. On my server it's cheapest on Fridays usually. Yesterday the mats cost only 25g, and the gloves 50. I sold a lot of gloves for 45 yesterday.. Twas a good day
---
But back to your question: maybe try writing the sellers directly? They should be able to sell it to you cheaper since then they don't have to pay the AH fee.
---
Alternatively, can you farm the mats with a skinner
---
Yeah, as a priest wanding was fine, but casting offensive spells resets the 5 seconds timer and wastes gcd. Thats usually too risky. As a druid I cant wand and going melee is just not worth it. So standing around it is. In TBC it meant jumping around because most my heals were instant, at least in 5 mans.
---
Just pick a reasonably cheap item to play around with, and like I said, set aside an amount of gold you can afford to lose. Back in tbc I took over the wool market on my server at one point, great fun.
---
Don't believe the idiots who says this is bad.
---
This ring is BiS for a very long time, it's fucking awesome. Prepop it before raid and try to avoid taking damage, you get amazing mp5 while doing so completely uncomparalbe to any other item. And if you ever lose the buff? Well swap rings when you leave combat !
---
If the guards can't reach you its bannable
---
Don’t worry people are smug douchebags on classic servers too. 
---
Generally I just ask them if they played on private servers and the answer is always yes
---
Block&gt;nova&gt;blizzard. Why would you cone of cold into your nova and not get distance and use blizzard?
---
RemindME! 7 hours "install this addon"
---
I'm lvl 58 and will soon start doing end-game dungeons (scholo, strat, Dm) as a tank. What tästrategies do I **need** to know? I'm not looking for a in-depth breakdown of each dungeon, jus basic stuff like "don't stand close to the platform when fighting Incendius", "Don't pull Mograine without clearing all other mobs in the cathedral first" or "you need to give 6 beers to that drunk dwarf to get past the Guzzler". 
---
Basically any information that will either cause me to wipe the group or be unable to complete the dungeon if I do not possess.
---
That's 2 hours of time to do anything else
---
There's a thing called "Hybrid Tax" that most hybrid builds don't want to talk about.
---
Oh please, there are non at the AH for weeks and there is noone selling. There are some that spam the chat 24/7 wanting to buy them, but they are unlucky.
---
I once saw ONE priest selling them for 1000.
---
So it begins...
---
Auctioneer is much better imo

I helped a rogue friend (I'm a resto druid) do this as well but we got it on the first run. Still a lot more effective than running a full group all the time.
---
Yeah true, it doesnt qualify by default.
---
Are you on a small server ? Theres constantly people organizing trash runs and selling T1 Boe's on mine
---
there's no kind of no other way up to TB though
---
To a degree yes as they have some degree of AoE and can tank most bosses? (depends up to which level and what kind of gear the hunter has)
---
The best is probably Mage tho as you can AoE everything down.
---
Engineering head piece can be obtained at level 10.
---
i cannot stand male nelfs with their stupid spikey bald guy looking haircuts and their goofy ass animations. worst designed model by far
---
Blackrock Depths
---
Im using Grid2  and  it doesnt work quite right for me aswell. Sometimes is shows incoming heals and sometimes it doesnt.
---
Ive read something about it only showing incoming heals when the actual caster of the incoming heal also has grid2, or any addon that works in a similar way. Cant tell for sure tho...
---
Best thing was the frostbolt reflect :))))
---
The deposit is nowhere near as meaningful as the ah cut on buyout price would
---
I'm on about 65 runs myself without seeing it, hope you get it soon
---
Burning stepps: Scorpid sting, run in and auto hit 2 times, wing clip, run out and auto shoot a few times, scorpid sting. Repeat.
---
Winterspring: Start it close to the road, theres a passage with 3 mobs and then kite it to the road. Keep max rank serpent sting on him and Rank 1 arcane shot every 5 second so it doesnt reset.
---
Silithus: Start it next to AQ40, wing clip to make him stand still, run around him in a circle to avoid him resetting. Ignore the small adds or multi shot the ones that get close.
---
Ungoro: The demon walks very close to a plateau way down south, you can kite it up there if you keep it active with dmg. Viper sting silences her lightning shot. Must be max rank to work, just keep silence her when she cast, then wing clip and run out and shoot her down.
---
Dont spam your abilities, bring a mana pot, its not essential though. You can use elixir of demon slaying, also not needed. You can use Greater Nature Protection Potion in un'goro, its not a mush if you keep her silenced. Greater Shadow Protection Potion in silithus, also not a must. Just conserve your mana. And have fun with it, its a unique quest.
---
Very nice! How selfish of you and totally irreverent to the conversation!
---
If you are somehow meleeing with your bow, then sure. 
---
For every point of Weapon Skill the  Hunter has over their Target's Defense Skill, the Hunter gains the following:
---
* Chance to Miss decreases by 0.04%.
---
* Chance for a Critical Hit increases by 0.04%.
---
* Target's chance to Block decreases by 0.04%.
---
* Target's chance to (Melee Only)Parry decreases by 0.04%.
---
* Target's chance to (Melee Only)Dodge decreases by 0.04%.
---
eventually, I re-rolled my vanilla Druid as soon as Troll Druids were released in Cata, I miss my original tauren, but the Troll cat form is so awesome
---
Thanks for these! I have some but not all of them.
---
I think I'm gonna have to dedicate most of my main bar to form shifting macros, since I only want for example the "shift out, do a thing, shift back to bear" macros on the bear action bar. Gonna have to fiddle a bunch with the keybinds...
---
Okay.
---
See?!
---
This is what i've bin saying. In vanilla all the tards rolled a hunter, in classic the same people went with mage.
---
Sounds like you deserved it lol. Horde only attacks in packs :p
---
What addon are you using to show the extra character stats? I used to have Extended Character Stats but that one seems to break every so often and isnt as clean.
---
The 450 dps Paladin parses are also world buffed, are they not?
---
(The answer is yes; 450 dps is a top ten parse world for rets on *any* fight in Molten Core)
---
Are we supposed to compare ret fully world buffed parses to bare raid buffed parses for other classes? Why do those numbers enter into your argument but are not allowed in the counterargument?
---
I'm not aware of the belt stuff.
---
Can you elaborate ? :o
---
Haha then dont buy it!
---
Ironforge! (im an undead rogue randomly ambushing players)
---
Tanaris, gankgedzan. Such good memories of pvp and guards killing everyone by accidents made.
---
I would not say it is a contract. Warlocks summon demons from the twisting nether whether they like it or not. For example: the Voidwalker will say things like "Send me back" or "I don't like this place".
---
&gt;and while I want it for threat
---
Tbh there arent many drood heals that roll for t1
---
this sort of advice is lost here man. this sub is aggressively casual and any advice that makes things go faster or be easier is really unwanted. 
---
I played healer for a while and would also tell locks to lifetap as much as they wanted and id take care of them. their dps is nutty and I love it.
---
Gurabashi arena is my favorite area, this is actually how I ended up meeting and making some incredible friends that even to this day still play with and talk to on a daily.
---
Thanks. I'm at work atm, didn't really have time to look.
---
Yeah I'm colorblind and I can stand on the herb and still not see it. Maps with green terrain is painful
---
You better log that shit with those numbers since apparantly your ret paladins do twice the average dps.  
---
Untill then the numbers you claim are useless.
---
As a level 60 warrior, my base intel is 30. Think about that.
---
What level is each wing of maraudon? I'm currently level 49, I was thinking of doing purple and orange for the staff/key and then the final part. Can i do each section at this level?
---

You can mix it up with seal of the crusader&gt;judge&gt;seal of command.
---
Other than that it's mundane.
---
Think we got a 530 parse, a lot of min/max players are also going to stack world buffs.
---
They’re completely allowed there’s no divide on that on my part.
---
Regardless you’re going to tell me 450 dps is bad?
---
Is it something you wish to talk about? /S....ympathy;)
---
The crit aura is less effective DPS than just bringing another Mage, FWIW. The buff only applies to the Oomies party, not the raid.
---
&gt;  And then that pserver closed down.
---
This is the reason I could never get myself to do pservers.
---
Just pop him at the base of BRM. He's a gnome before that.
---
Blackhands, also when u get onyxia head get the neck, the tank trink isnt worth it.
---
It is also pre raid BiS for Druids in P1.
---
Why are you talking so much trash about this ring? :D
---
Yes it is gone quick. Nobody says anything against that. Until it is gone 22 mp5 is still quite a lot. 
---
As Long as you are ready to replace it once you have taken too much damage. It is perfect.
---
Sooooo
---
it is not complete trash as you are saying
---
These are your servers prices. Before Dire maul hit I did the math on mine and came to the conclusion 6-7g per transmute was fine with me.
---
This has changed since, because the price difference between crystals and bars increased and I guess some people are still catching up to it. Doesn't change the reasoning behind their decision you asked for.
---
Show logs where you outperform the cookie cutter builds. Im quite curious
---
NEIN (is what you mean?)
---
Then it would be JA
---
wtf man?
---
How big do the pots get in your MC runs? I feel like this would be really lucrative even if you aren’t buying gear
---
I mean, I don’t mind. But you heavily emphasized “ average” dps assuming all players are established by their class/spec choice. 
---
It’s almost like players can’t be good and do better then average?
---
&gt;I strongly prefer TukUI to ElvUI in Classic.
---
really? you can adjust ELVui just as much as Tuk, you could make it look like tuc easy. The only difference is the GUI interfaces make it easier to do that, rather than having to deal with the lua. Change the scale to .7 or something and it'll look loads better on 1600+ resolutions.
---
Ì'm a skinner but I want to buy the parts while I am still leveling (currently 49). Auctioneer told me the prices are currently 81% of normal, so I guess they are normally even more expensive.
---
I bought the pants directly, but Ill gather some more gold and see if i can get the gauntlets cheaper like you suggested
---
Knew it was a druid
---
Blizzards shitty servers will crap down on anything bigger fight than 80ppl+. If you get a multiple raids into a capital city, you are in the server crash territory.
---
never seen them PvP was just speaking PvE wise, phase 2 aint out yet so I wouldnt be suprised if ppl dont go ham in pvp
---
I did this with a friend of mine at 57, he's a warrior. HoJ dropped and he rolled need and won it because he only had one trinket. When the lvl 60 rogue in the party learned that my friend was intending to spec prot at 60 and was only needing the trinket to level the last 3 levels he sounded like he was going to off himself, poor soul. My friend felt kinda bad about it later but had no clue the trinket was THAT sought after. It was our first BRD run.
---
It's BiS for AoE pull even at lvl 60
---
I have an amazing time with my raid every week min/maxing and trying to optimize our kills times and clear speeds. People like different things.
---
The warctaft log data is very reliable, it's the only concrete data we have for dps. It will definitely change going into BWL and further, no doubt about that. I think ret pallies and boomkings will do even worse on longer fights because they will run out of mana. But like you said, we will have to wait and see about that.
---
To conclude this whole little convo, I think hybrids are viable for all content in this game, but they arent optimal. I think all of the content up to naxx will be pretty easy and clear speeds and kill times will be the only competitive drive keeping my guild and I interested.
---
Click on yourself for a breakdown?

This is what it looks like for me.

I always go early when I join a UBRS run and scout for Jed myself, and organize with the other casters.

achsually!

There is a backdoor road! That doesn't have a lift.

You need to get the proc to go off on a 3+ mob pull otherwise no. Ww axe beats it easily due to having stats.

That is a bannable offense they're doing btw report em all

"classic wow mage pre raid bis"
---
"vanilla wow mage bis"
---
"Classic wow BIS list mage"
---
But anyway I think you got your answer anyway :D 
---
I really like the Wowhead BIS List 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/mage-dps-gear-bis-classic-wow
---
Because it has BIS lists for all phases and pre-raid bis.
---
Also it pretty much has info on everything else you could ask for :)
---
So you want to spend as little time in the water as possible? The main problem is him coming up on the ledge from the water. It's hard to explain, but basically he comes up on the ledge then when I jump in the water he doesn't run to the 2nd pillar he runs past me towards the doorway you come in.
---
This was a private server thing. Guaranteed sit-crits don't work in Classic, it's on Blizz's "working as intended" list.
---
Alliance are better in big scale pvp. Like 40v40 alliance wins if they are not dogshit.
---
People complaining that tanks and healers roll on "DPS" gear in levelling dungeons are why you need to LFM Uldaman for over an hour.
---
Next to nobody is questing with Sword and Board, they need 2h. Healers cant heal a mob to death, they need to actually damage quest mobs.
---
I agree that if everyone is doing their job correctly that there is no need for hybrid classes, but I could equally say that 2 hybrid dps / healers are going to perform about as well as a dedicated healer and a dedicated dps, the ability to alternate means you can pick what's needed when it's needed, a good example of this is Shazzrah in MC, as a Melee dps you can't do anything but wait for him to die, but a Druid can help heal and still dps from afar, a paladin can help quickly top people off when the boss teleports and even focus on applying seals at intervals to help sustain the groups mana, a shaman can heal too during the downtime. Fights like this where the Healer - Melee DPS - Caster DPS - Tank system doesn't work out as well, the strategies built for that fight have lots of the dedicated pure DPS sitting the fight out, whereas the hybrid specs get to focus on their other strengths in the mean time.
---
Thing is if it's purely about speed, then Warriors are the top DPS, so having 30 of them, 7 healers and 3 (warrior) tanks would be the most optimal way to clear raids (bare with me, part of my point), but when you start weighing in strategies and boss differences you start needing different classes, Garr favors warlocks for their Banish, Majordomo favours mages for their polymorph, Ragnaros favours shamans / paladins for their Fire resistance buffs ect, you get to a point where a balanced composition of classes is best so you can clear all content with the same group without having to swap people in or out, but hybrids can easily fit in there, having a few druids / paladins / shamans that can perform multiple roles would allow you to better perfect your group for each fight, like the Shazzrah one mentioned before. My point is that hybrid specs are OK everywhere, like 75% efficiency all the time, but other classes are 100% or 50% efficiency from fight to fight.
---
We’re crimson dawn on Grobbulous — I don’t believe we have any logs available yet but like I mentioned to someone else here I’m more then happy to log parses myself to put up.
---
If something is wrong with your personal settings, it's not the fault of the addon. Just recheck and redo your operations.
---
TSM is by far the more powerful and complete addon, but it requires some time and effort to set up and get into. If you can't be bothered with that and aren't a serious AH player, then go for a simpler alternative such as Auctioneer or Auctinator.
---
Nice :D at first they were going for some hefty sums yeah. So i was like wondering if i should spend the money on it, but since raid time was on sunday, i waited just before raid and they crashed to the ground :D
---
I just picked a time to illustrate the value.
---
Same to you my friend.
---
BRD. It's an epic dungeon with multiple routes and a ton of flavor to many of it's areas. The bar especially makes you feel like you're playing an RPG.
---
Icyveins will tell you that 1 agi is \~ 2.5ap and 1 crit is \~ 32 ap. I have never understood where this comes from though. Still, in my opinion, 60 ap is better than 1% crit. My logis is: paper dps on 60 is 150 (theoretically). 1% crit is 1.3% damage (lethal shots) so like 2dps \~ 28 ap. 60 ap is like 4dps -&gt; 60 ap wins!
---
Logs again discredit this, I’m not sure why people keep saying this.
---
I felt bad for everyone in that raid
---
Got it. Thanks
---
Westfall holds so many fond memories for me, as an altoholic I cleared that zone too many times to count!
---
Watched Angry Birds 2 yesterday for some odd reason. I can relate.
---
But the guards don't even try to reach you there since there aren't any in range.
---
Bit of a controversial opinion here. I played hunter in vanilla and thought i was great, got to that quest chain and for 2 weeks it kicked my ass. Melee demon - wtf i am a hunte ri don't want to melee. Kite one across WS - bruh this mofo too fast and i need to kite perfectly or i am dead etc
---
2 weeks it took me to improve enough to kill those demons and it helped me out so much in both pvp and raids. I went from shi*t tier kiter to my guilds designated kiter.
---
I think genuinley this is one of those times where being charitable doesn't help and if a hunter is not good enough to beat the quest then they shouldn't get the bow/staff.
---
sounds harsh i know but if they work hard enough they will improve a huge amount from this and those items will mean a huge amount to the player just because of what went in to getting them.
---
I still have my full T1 and bow/staff on my hunter on retail (although can't use them both at same time anymore) still keep them because of how much work it took.
---
as a side-note there is some help that is good, like getting cursed by a lock in silitus so the demon cannot fear you etc.
---
also you can get another hunter who has done the quest to kite the demon for you in WS and it won't despawn (again i don't recommend this but it is up to you)
---
Exactly.
---
For some items the deposit is a mere fraction of the items worth
---
Check my history for it. Or google “Reddit classicwow useful macros Rogue”
---
Underrated comment
---
I'm a Rogue too. I use cats eye goggles for when I'm rogue or Druid hunting.
---
If you play on off hours you should be on a full realm. You wont have to deal with queues anyway.
---
Its really how you value queues versus amount of people running dungeons
---
Or taken "hunter item"s in instances grieving those who really needed them.
---
I have used tsm for retail forever please suck my ass
---
Way to miss the point.
---
Rip english :D
---
DPS guys must have been pants then, Feral AND Balance should be able to keep up right now, specially if they are in wildheart/feralheart.
---
A mistake most feral make if they are new to it is not stacking enough int, It's important since the less pool you have, the less you are going to get out of furor.
---
If your booster kills mobs one by one, it's pointless.
---
That's good sport m8
---
Fair I get the point, but a differential of that much is adding 5 seconds at most to a fight if that. 
---
Why does it matter?
---
In BC, it was very hard to get into a group as a DPS if you didnt provide consistent CC and dps. I played enhance shaman, and it was very hard to get into a group over a mage, rogue, or hunter. 
---
Shamans wanted CC and rogues wanted some better AoE dmg. So in wrath (I think), they gave shamans Hex so they could also provide some CC; and they gave rogues Fan of Knives to be able to do better AoE.
---
Obviously the community has different opinions about everything and Blizzard thought they were doing what was right for the game and the community.
---
Things just got a bit out of hand and the homogenization went too far.
---
Yeah, because they follow the BiS list and "best pve spec" guides, that's my point.
---
You’re my hero. My role model.
---
Oops hehe
---
If you are not planning to tank or active PvP - it's useless.  
---
For tanking in dungeons it have some uses, and it's very important in PvP.
---
I'm pretty noob with operations TBH, I need to find a way to reset it to default
---
That was actually really funny.
---
uhh what? I never knew, where?
---
Your arcane should be side specced frost 100% crit damage. Arcane missiles hah your funny
---
60 Druid, have about 330 gold. What's the best way to farm gold to my epic mount?
---
You can download it directly. Will work for both retail and classic.
---
Classic Ironforge, front of the city. I am PvPer, you know why then there.
---
If their Christians what?
---
No. Because I dont care about your opinion and have nothing to prove to you.
---
No, I never do it but it sometimes just happens. If I’m on my Priest or Paladin though I struggle through it.
---
That’s pretty dope only need a few whales to really pay out. With illicit gold prices that high I can’t imagine people are buying jt. I enjoy economics so I track gold/usd prices and my server in UzS east is close to 10 cents/1g
---
This is so true...
---
For me, the worst part is "item x is locked"... What the hell? I will never go with people who lock items. Everyone is doing the same job. And therefore everyone should have the same chance for the loot.
---
As a rouge... I cannot attack more than 2 targets at once. I leveled almost without going instances. Luckily my guild helped me with some dungeon quests... 
---
Please - whoever reads this - stop your thinking of min/max. Let's just have fun! Don't play the game for loot. Play it for the experience. Play it to get new friends. Don't support locking items.
---
As a healer priest I actually prefer hybrid DPS in dungeons, especially over the ‘gogogo’ mages that AoE everything and anything irrespective of healers mana and tanks aggro, or the locks who insist on life tapping at 10% health (and who also compete with on gear) while spamming hellfire, or the hunters who seemingly volunteer to have their pet off tank with growl, not to mention the rogues who make it their mission to face mobs while they cleave, or are otherwise too too busy pickpocketing. I’m not stereotyping those classes btw, merely making the point that having a ‘pure’ dps class in your party isn’t going to guarantee competence.
---
People sleep on the utility hybrids bring too. In addition to their amazing buffs there’s also nothing more relieving than having a wipe saved after a bad pull because a Shaman/Druid/Pally bro had chimed in with the healing once they noticed your mana is shot. And if you die as a healer, there’s a chance they can spare you the graveyard run by rezzing.
---
Y’all always welcome in my groups, especially since you’re likely not to compete with me for drops lol.
---
https://youtu.be/HjcpkrN2ADM
---
At 16:35 they talk about it.
---
They just wanted to have some fun.
---
They most likely had to wait anyways. So why not make you wait with them? :D
---
never knew about that ! Can you go around and curse of doom low level mobs, just to pop a doomguard and enslave it ?
---
A perfect group setup involves 3 pallies imo! 
---
Devo + Ret + Sanc auras
---
BoW/BoM + BoK + BoSanct (salvation for dps) 
---
All the judgments!
---
If I'm not mistaken you are damn fast if you do 4 horsemen that quick. That's ofc way down the line and certainly not comparable to MC and Onyxia.
---
Im glad Sly finally found a server where he can shine like that precious diamond he is.
---
People have been saying the same about Return, PvE only guild :D 
---
Can't wait til phase 2 and no more layers, being accused of dodging in BRM when you run fully buffed an protection potted and see no one is no fun. :D
---
I didn't say I'm put dpsing good warriors and rogues who know their rotations. I'm saying im out dpsing rogues and warriors. 
---
 Want to know something else. I'm have more fun on a ret paly then the people complaining about ret palys.
---
this is everything.
---
He did, and the server crapped itself.
---
Ok thanks i‘ll try. Does it work 100% (except resists) after blizzards latest changes?
---
Most don't :)
---
It's a dirt road in the back of the spirit isle (not where the cave is)
---
This... this is great.
---
Nothing. There's Priest benediction quest that also need to be completed alone.
---
On raid nights there are 3 horde raids camping both entrances, no way to avoid it.
---
I have 2 toons, 33 druid and 32 pally.
---
Come at me bro.
---
Oh damn you have to be exalted with darnassus too?
---
Since i mainly do instances to level up (and also did that back in vanilla) i would have to say the Temple of Atal'Hakkar is by far my favourite, i can not wait to get my warrior high enough to tank it again
---
He is at 1.5k like the graph says
---
Kinda?
---
We were a group of friends where one had a guild already from retail. We were all meant to join them on Gehennas.
---
Come launch day, the queues on Gehennas are 7+ hours, so aside from our friend who was already in the guild, the rest of us decide to temporarily play on a different server, and then start our Gehennas characters once things have calmed down.
---
A few days later, it has become clear that Gehennas queues will remain quite long, so we decide to stay on the new server, and our friend promises to make an alt there once he has time for one.
---
We start a guild on the new server with the whole friend group and some people we met in game. A couple of weeks in, some people are ready to start poking their noses into some raids. The guild is too small to really get one going, so instead they join another guild's raid, thanks to a guy from that guild who they've done some dungeons with before. All is well, people have fun, they do the first two bosses of MC with 30 people most of whom aren't level 60 yet. They do this a couple of times with, I think, two different guilds?
---
Eventually they get an offer from one of the guilds that we can all join them, and our GM and a few other guys can get officer roles, so we don't go from running our own guild to zero power. After some discussion, we take them up on it, and now one of my friends is running the new guild's second raid team along with our former GM and a few others. The new guild seems great, fun people, fair with loot (at least I've heard no complaints - I'm still leveling, so I'm mostly watching from the sidelines). They even exchange BoE's between the two raid teams if one team doesn't need an item - my friend was joking that he gets more gear from the raid team he *isn't* on, because he's been having pretty bad luck with drops on his own runs.
---
So even though the plans went in the trashcan almost immediately, I'd say it worked out alright.
---
Hunters are better because of Aspect of Cheetan, that will give noobs in party +30% running speed.
---
lol lying on the internet 
---
Okie dokie
---
well he has "cock" in his name so it´s not like he would try to hide that he´s a douche ... just sayin
---
that's my fear, wpvp  battles are fucking broken. How are private servers so much better, hell i even remember in WOTLK we raided cities all the time because of that mount achivment, and i seem to remember it working just fine?
---
If you finished in Felwood, why not to continue into Winterspring?  
---
It have quest-chains that lead into un'Goro and WPL\EPL.
---
yea but who cares about total raid dps i just want to see big numbers more often on my screen
---
I use both
---
This, in my eyes, is exactly what drew me to WoW and what drove me away from Retail and back to Classic
---
This is really good advice. I honestly appreciate it. I will 100% give it a go when I get away from work. It's probably not going to be the highest gold earner, but I expect it will be a fun one.
---
My bank is literally full of em cause i havent bothered levelling it still.
---
Talk to a gm. Its a bug
---
You're doing a really good job of showing us that you know nothing about TSM.
---
The only variable in all I posted where crits. All of the other things happens concretely.
---
In all honesty, most millennials  wouldn't know what a port is. Most software is preconfigured out of the box. Gen X, Gen Y very much had to learn and set up everything at a technical level so please understand that they've earned their stripes.
---
I'd drop booming voice and blood craze for unbridled wrath and dual wield spec. Work your way towards TM, you'll get there eventually.
---
That was me we formed a train and we’re taking laps around iron forge and got bored so we rp walked to sw, we made a friend along the way but some mean rogues kept trying to kill us
---
Scholo:  A good chunk of mobs threat wipe/drops so just be ready with taunts, ghouls have aoe cloud on death, and unstable corpses explode(as a tank its manageable).  Rattlegore has the key (1-time use) for the next part of the dungeon.  The light-blue ghost type mobs should always die first, fast, and get stunned as much as possible due to AoE mana burn/silences.
---
Strat: 2 sides.  Live side you need scarlet key, UD side preferably need Key to the City(drops off Magistrate) or alternatively go the long way around.  After you kill bosses outside Ziggurats you need to go inside and kill acolytes.  Gargoyles with screecher(?) in their name fear for a short duration so don't be standing too close to other mob packs.  Banshee boss MC will break after taking enough dmg but if you spike that person too hard/fast they will die instead, just drop their hp slow/steady.  Event prior to baron is all on a timer and Ramstein is going to agro no matter what so make sure before you pull the last abomination your group is full mana or close to it.  Holy water to kill the skeletons that Baron Rivendare summons will trivialize the encounter especially if you don't have a mage for AoE.
---
DM:  DMW has a lot of AoE dmg but not much you can do about it.  Hunter boss has a large agro range so just be aware she is going to agro from ~30-40yds away.
---
DMN: Be aware of difference between tribute/non-tribute runs.
---
DME:  Cakewalk.
---
Arathi Highlands because its green
---
Yeah this. We have enough mages.. I just want to see my big numbers. It's not like it's not on farm anyways now
---
It's tough, I levelled as fury up until 40 where i respecce arms for MS  
---
 Personally i'd go with something like this  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/20305001-5500000512501](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/20305001-5500000512501)   
---
Although DW before getting hit gear can be quite crappy to be honest with you, it does seem to be a waste of another respec though as you'll have to end up respeccing into a better layour for pve or pvp for spec  
---
at 60 with 6% hit and 2 axes (i'm orc) i'm running:  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/20305011302-05050005525010051](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/20305011302-05050005525010051)

---
PoE is just finding one good ability and min maxing it to the most disgusting level
---
I have also been doing my first MC raids the last 3-4 weeks and I recognize everything you write. Basically, if the raid leader / heal leader doesn't set up any healing assignments there will be a lot of overhealing because there really isn't that much healing needed in the beginning, so as soon as someone loses hp all healers will be there waiting to heal. Even if there are healing assignments there will still be a lot of over healing, but it's necessary for the later fights (Majordomo and Ragnaros).  
---
It helps if all the healers get healcomms, as you can then see if someone is already about to be healed.   
---
Also, many healers (in my experience) seem to care a lot about the amount of healing done in the logs/details addon, which means they spam flash heal to climb the list. This is of course unnecessary and not mana effective in the long run. There is no reason to care about this.
---
I don't know lol
---
This, so much. Every time I see a warrior with Mark of Tyranny or Onyxia Blood Talisman, I cry a little inside.
---
Neither 
---
AUX
---
yeah I'm just saying id love to see this happen consistently. I grouped with a lot of try hard rets and they just always lost. even a guy who was a big theory crafted and dank ass tank but just couldn't make ret work. idk man like i said if yall get some logs id love to see em
---
Nope. Didnt really exist then, at least not "in public".
---
Thank you
---
Anything that keeps aggro off lowbies is good enough. A hunter works well because your pet pretty much tanks the dungeon while you’re able to pick off mobs who break free with your ranged attacks.
---
It always depends on the group. Usually, it is way faster and less time consuming than wearing a shield/sword combo on trash packs. The sooner they are dead the less you have to heal as a healer. If the overall DPS suck it is another story of course. Well, I am hitcapped and rocking a good 2hander, if you dont have the gear as a warrior to do enough damage or your group dps in general is too low,  you should of course stick to the shield. Cleared strath UD in solid 45 minutes yesterday and just using 2hander until baron. Had a full heal priest, a mage, warlock and rogue, no wipes. The healer seemed quite happy.
---
Is the Molten Helm in the game atm?  
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20854/molten-helm
---
Now that's thinking with portals.
---
You can see what it's used for right there on that page. Dreamweave is excellent caster leveling gear, green lens is used as pre-raid gear for engineer casters/healers and the two potions are quite handy for pvp. However, HotW is rather common and is never a limiting factor for those, hence why it's pretty cheap.
---
I started doing BRD around this level if you can find a group for it (may be a challenge if they are only doing farming runs and not quests).  If you do all the quest chains its a good chunk of xp over 2-3 runs.
---
Managing 10 reports day in and out, knowing their roles and to a degree their private lives in order to have empathy is magnitudes more complex and draining than raid leading. A large part is about consequence and raid leading has very little, and generally the more serious you take it, the worse it ends up being for all involved. No one wants to feel like they're at work in WoW.
---
I can confirm, it is fortunately not.
---
What do language skills have to do with a Spanish fire exit? I'm from the Netherlands and I have no idea what's going on
---
Everlook always had a super special place in my heart, love the goblin vibes in classic and Winterspring is such a gorgeous zone.
---
No probs, keep an eye out for next week I’ll get some up.
---
No, it wasn't really a thing, though solo mage aoe farming was pretty well known. I'm not sure if it was even possible on earlier patches.
---
I don't recognize this at all. As a class without consistent CC (Warlock) I never had trouble getting into groups. Sure you could say Warlock DPS was top notch in BC, but there was literally no consistent CC available.
---
Blizzard failed to realize what game their players desired, and fucked it up with class homogenization. They should never have allowed classes to all have consistent CC and try to get every specialization the ability to do everything.
---
They started with that in BC, to a tolerable level, but already then it was too much.
---
Thinking about it, I agree with you. I skipped the garrison and came back to WoW but the dailies in legion and again in bfa were the final blow for me too.
---
Its not in an MMO
---
Correction: Ironforge to SW
---
Source: I walked it ;)

 Stranglethorn Vale
---
3 for the low lvl, 6 for the higher one.
---
Your totems can be target of the it as well so that might have been the case
---
What's wrong with it? It's my favorite weapon for aoe DPS. I know it's a bad weapon for a stat stick but it's not a bad weapon, It's about how you use it.
---
Let just 1 blue skinned orc join in :P
---
\&gt;Playing alone in a few months.  
---
After you get your gear you just end up playing with guildies and friends anyway, so that's not really a problem for anyone.
---
I'd say the problem was less to do with homogenisation and more to do with certain roles being gated by mechanics. A Shadow Priest for example would be far stronger if there was no debuff limit and an Enhancement Shaman would be far more desirable if things like Windfury Totem were locked behind enhancement talents.
---
The Barrens. Its just so iconic and I have so many fond memories from hanging out there.
---
Correct! Okay it sounds like you let him pass the middle pillar and he got too close to you up on the ledge? If that is the case he will take the path "behind you" instead. If this happens you can hug the pillar in the middle until he is close to you, jump up again and he should get up on the ledge, you jump down and he picks the correct path again. It takes a couple of tries to get the positioning right and learn his pathing so don't be discouraged!
---
God this makes me so proud to be the horde
---
Well, welcome to farming for your BiS gear then pretty much more farming for whatever else you need like an epic mount, then pretty much logging in once a week to raid...
---
It's war. There are no rules, only winners and losers. Anything goes. Flask up.
---
Damn, level shamed me. How original.
---
exactly this !
---
Just guesswork here, but I'd say 1-50 will be more or less the same, but the last ten levels will be pure hell if you're on the less populated faction, with level 60's trying to farm honor of lowbies.
---
I just hover my mouse over the area where I expect the sungrass until I find it
---
Playing what you want didn't exsist in 2006, your literally giving people terrible advice.
---
Uhh wait you bleeped out every other named besides one name that is I'm assuming EVERY OTHER NAME BESIDES IN PARTY
---
Abaolutely gamechanging mechanics
---
Not saying it’s not. It’s a style thing. Similar to using either ‘numbers’ or ‘123’s. You can’t start a writing by spelling out numbers and then later use the non-spelled numbers. 
---
It’s pedantry.
---
&gt;Never bubble (PWS) the tank unless they are at risk of dying  
---
Unless it's a paladin :)
---
If it helps, i only run regular groups as a mage.
---
Also i hate mage. Just wanted to level a farm char and that was a mistake.
---
Molten Core
---
A better romance than what? It has to be compared to something for the sentence to work.
---
Exactly. I tank 99% of the time in dungeons as ret paladin.
---
Last time I was invited as dps for scholo... Later the tank said I should buff everyone and myself with salvation.
---
My answer was : na I am ret paladin I don't do dmg
---
Would multiboxing stop if Blizzard simply removed the follow function?
---
Behind the fire is a spwan point. We alrdy found 2 books there
---
So when you hug the pillar until he is close to you do you jump up on the ledge or into the water, and are you on the side close to or far from the 2nd pillar
---
That was me just putting it mildy. If you want the hard explanation: "Spaniards out"
---
Warrior leveling becomes easier as the server progresses. The true warrior experience is on fresh servers
---
I've heard there are ways to do that. I think a simple google/youtube search should pop a quick fix.
---
aaaah ok i got the sense of these stats now - basically how the site works is that it calculates the chance to get the item in each run for each series of runs.
---
so to speak, while running 4 times it sums the chance to get the item at the first, second, third, fourth chance. I was just discussing the chance to get the item at the last chance.
---
Perhaps 2v2 or 3v3 might be more interesting.
---
Perhaps it would be played in its own instanced version, like a smaller arena...
---
:^)
---
10 slotters will last you to your 40s easily
---
Strafing is a lot less work. Just need to get the target into your front 180 degree arc to shoot.
---
At that point I'm sure you could have spent like 1g on a necklace from AH haha
---
It's all fun and games until you realize that mc you run every week could be over an hour sooner if you were in a guild that rejected hybrids. Or that could save 500g on consumables because your not wiping in bwl but instead speeding through it without flasks. Or the idea of getting past the first trash pull in aq40 and actually seeing the massive underground instance. I'm not saying playing hybrids is wrong, just shedding some light why it will be hard to find a guild to take you in.
---
i had several people running through the demon and immediately getting wiped lol
---
Don’t forget the shiny bauble!;)
---
I've definitely grouped with him before.
---
Then you should actually try it when you get the opportunity to do so. It's a fun quest.
---
What?  
---
People call the spec shithouse because it's not the cookie cutter build, which is the whole point of this thread?  
---
Do you think my raid members are calling the build shit? LOL...
---
I'm still allowed to raid in that spec for a reason.. do you think if it was a problem i wouldn't change/be asked to change?  
---
The problem is people blindly follow whatever some guide told them not realizing that the "10+ yEarRs oF eStAbLIsHeD data" was collated from multiple different private servers whom all had their own algorithms and formulas..  
---
I mean i could probably bet top dollar you're using TSS/MoU/Cadav Chest and have double crusader on your krol blade/mirahs song because the internet told you that's optimal.
---
I consider them a necessary evil. They are often considered "bad guys" and in RP probably no WL will admit openly that he/she is a WL.
---
With this you can have a ton of fun though.
---
Also no class is really kill on sight, except for AoE farming opposing mages.
---
Juicy!
---
Ferals can compete with mages if you farm pummelers and powershift tbh, look at logs and you'll see
---
Go there when the quests are all green and you'll have a fine old time.
---
180 dps is horrible. I do that on my tank warrior
---
I agree with you.
---
If you have a raid, and your tank is at 80% of max "tankiness", your healers at 60% of maximum efficiency and all your DPS only doing 60% of what they could? you're still handily clearing every boss just fine. Some people feel that min-maxing to the extreme to cut clear times by a few minutes if worth it. Personally, I'd rather just people have fun playing what they're playing.
---
Back in the day, in my horde guild:  
---
We were using a bear tank as tank #2 for pretty much every raid - pre 1.12.  
---
We had a dedicated enhancement shaman who was doing fine on our meters - and who sometimes took that 5th tank spot on Garr etc.  
---
I was often main tanking with 0 points in prot because I couldn't be arsed respeccing.
---
And so on, and so forth, and we cleared stuff just fine. Whenever we had issues, it was down to execution - not specs or gear.
---
Hell, look at the first Rag kill in classic. They had people below level 60 and crap gear.
---
If a guild enjoys min-maxing, let it. But it's seriously not needed.
---
we were terrified.
---
I mean we clear MC/Ony in 2 hours, I’m not sure what more I could want.
---
that was my guild.  we thought you were trying to sacrafice that poor undead.  
---
i was the female orc warrior who was just trying to peacefully follow.
---
OT: icy veins "guides" (if you can call them that) are really shit overall, always cross-reference them.
---
Unfortunately for you, as a warrior, there is a mantra that gets pummeled into our skulls from an early level. Every encounter cements this further, until we know nothing else.
---
*Never, ever trust a mage*
---
And so, by the time we are big and strong, even though you do not pose a threat, the reflex will always be the same.  
---
*Maim. Kill. Dismember.* 
---
Lest you come back, in more numbers  and stronger than before, and again teach us the age-old lesson.
---
How annoying would that be for the pally's party lol. Longest dungeon run ever
---
Don’t worry the trolls always have debt collectors on standby
---
I Shaman tanked RFC, and it was actually pretty smooth. I was level 14 when we started the dungeon, and got to level 15 after the first boss. I already have mostly greens except for my gloves which I still had a grey cloth, I also already had the items from the quests in this dungeon so that really helped. 
---
The best thing with my shaman tanking experience was that it was already 12 am so my group mates had no choice but to go with me, but all jokes aside, it was really smooth. As you can see by the damage taken meter on the lower right corner, my casters pretty much took no damage at all and the only real reason why the rogue took so much beating (which all rogues deserve) was because he was hitting the ranged mob instead of letting our mage sheep it. Rockbiter Weapon alone actually deals so much threat that you really do not lose aggro, if there are two or more mobs I would pull with my Earth Shock that way my group mates know which to hit, and if they do decide to hit the other mob, my earth shock would have already been up once the mobs reaches us that way I can use it a second time.
---
The bad thing about shaman tanking is that you have to be very careful with how you manage your mana, at first I tried to just cast every spell I can on every mob which was pretty bad because you end up drinking after every pull. What I instead casted were Earth Totem, Searing Totem, and lightning shield all at once before every pull. If you do it this way you wont run out of mana every single pull and you can always guarantee to have more than half a mana at your disposal.
---
Sure it's RFC, you can probably make your dog tank it. But I'm just saying, I Shaman tanked RFC, and it was actually pretty smooth.
---
They are really  wrong... Just look at paladin heal bis.... They say the legs from brd are bis...now look at scholo ghoul leather legs... Clearly better in any way for heal Palas and they don't even get a mentioning

---
Thank you in the name of all fire mages. You can't imagine how refreshing it is if someone doesn't want to explain me that I shouldn't level in fire.
---
You should be. Terrified at how much free time people have lol
---
Nah he saw us in wearing gorge and was jumping and waving so we let him walk with us. We would have left you alone but the rogues were being Cock suckers, if you woulda just walked we would have let you be
---
As a 60 Fury warrior in decent tanking gear I’ve had little trouble tanking strat, scholo and dm north. How much harder would UBRS be? Is it a drastic difference past Rend?
---
Great another player segment to compete with on hit/crit leather gear *cries in feral druid*
---
Take an upvote, I like your logic.
---
Afaik this is the best for melee 19 twink. 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7230/smites-mighty-hammer
---
Then you didn't read the follow up replies because there is clearly evidence showing that they clearly can work but are not optimal with average pally damage in raids vs warriors and rogues. Why do people try to refute data? Every class has their weaknesses and strengths
---
I'm German and i kindly ask you not to ask any further questions.
---
Let's not kid anyone here.  Speccing for your role in raids absolutely was a thing in Vanilla just as it is now in Classic.  If speccing how you like is important to you the you do you - but a raid leader will reserve the right not to choose you if that missing performance might be the difference between success and failure.
---
I installed auctioneer and have made 40g in 2 days from auctioning things I used to just vendor.
---
It’s amazing what some things sell for.
---
But hey, at least you don't have to compete for the trinket with priest healers anymore as they get a better one from a book in DM!
---
*slow clap starts*
---
you guys mostly left me, i actually attacked first time so  i couldn't blame you.  i had fun.
---
Hell no contest there, every person should be responsible for their performance in the raid, if someone isn’t to par — I can easily see cutting folks and getting some more suited candidates in.
---
BiS is BiS dude. All other classes only exist to support Hunters anyway.
---
then you get shoved in the right side room in the cathedral
---
Rattlegore server, contact Coldgrin or my main, takriban
---
i'm not ashamed to admit i dropped everything i was doing to go see.
---
Yes. But don't worry it get's better at 60, you have 1 heal and a dispell 😂
---
What are the odds
---
The real ninja is the mage.
---
lmao
---
It takes like 15 minutes to get a troll to level 5-6, so no
---
you can get it back, make a ticket
---
Mine is an improved weapons totem resto.
---
I can link it when I get home if I remember 😅
---
I’m 44 lvled as fury but did 10 points in my 20s in arms for parry and tactical mastery to help with tanking as i went along. Don’t regret at all. I love being able to stance dance. Well worth it IMO.
---
Feralas.
---
Running into packs everywhere? Yeah...great CC you've got there. I'd get kicked more from groups for fearing than not....
---
Best of luck!
---
With full consumes as a melee dps it's awful.
---
To be fair, druids aren't numerous and 90% of them play them for the "shifting into animals, haling people" trip, not being a fucking giant chicken. 
---
People playing priests do it because the class flavor is healing with the light, the one wanting to play shadows are a minority, and most of them play warlock.
---
I am not even trying to get rep.
---
A single CC was good, but not required. If you, as an enhancement shaman, couldn't get a group with 1 other guy with a CC, then you were either very poor at getting a group or just unwilling to.
---
You are missing one book spawn that is in the south/west corner of the flower room. If you just walk towards that corner (after talking to the tree) there is a book that can spawn by the teal colored lasher.
---
Thanks man!! I guess in context im KINDA lucky. 
---
All thats dropped that i rolled on was, NS shoulders, bracers and waist. 
---
I got 33% of it.
---
The only real difference is you don't have some tool trying to snipe you from a safespot in Booty Bay.
---
I remember it differently tbh. 1 cc was mandatory.
---
So here’s how I did it 
---
For neck and rings 
---
1. MP5
---
2. Strength 
---
3. Intellect
---
For everything else 
---
1. Strength 
---
2. Intellect
---
3. Stamina
---
I think it's a combination of low skill, bad class, and bad gear - I  think she uses only Plate gear no matter how bad it is for DPS (as we all know, there's little Plate DPS gear in vanilla)
---
But is the desktop app not linked to the cloud that has not yet been updated to function in Classic yet :D?
---
I'm taking about mob respawn trackers
---
I want that ring for my Warlock just because the purble irb effect.
---
Lots of good gray vendor loot.
---
I'm curious - what made you choose Inventorian over Bagnon?
---
aslo, between soulstone, battle rez, shadowform, heal drain, druid going bear, this compo is pretty good to handle the worst "oh shit" situation
---
The MC fomo is real
---
So with that mind people shouldn't bring fire pots for Ragnaros since they can just sit out and let range do it instead? 
---
Flawed logic right there, and yes Shazzrah was a bad example.
---
This is why spy is the best
---
What kind of gpu is that, struggling with max settings on wow? Nokia?
---
After adding the strength provided by SMH you get a dps of +-21.9 so 1 more dps than Glacial Stone but factoring the speed of the weapon your hit will be nearly the same which is what interest us in a PvP scenario.
---
Plus GS as a chance to proc its frost damage which makes it better by a large margin.
---
No they didn't. Not when it comes to specs, anyway. Ret pallies are just objectively worse than warriors and rogues. Especially if you're not hit-capped, which you won't be for a long time. Most serious guilds won't accept ret, especially when holy has so much more utility overall.
---
Alot of these comms just sound like people aren't good at their respective roles. Tanks not tanking, DPS being stupid. If you want good players you have to trim the fat. When you get into raid, you're there to not waste other people's time. I plugged molten core for two weeks before I got a raid spot and nothing is more frustrating when the herd of cats doesn't understand basic raid etiquette.
---
Take your agenda and fuck Off

Is improved feign death needed for this?

Most of the time people only really care about Unforgiven out of those 3, and if all you care about is him + scarlet crusade then back entrance is the most efficient.
---
Why do u keep tactical knife on your desk? 
---
Also like view from your window.
---
I don’t understand how you can’t get hit called as ret with a 3% talent and a plethora of hit items but sure, go on.
---
Personal favorite, /moon
---
*Sylvanas agrees*
---
Less damage than the tank is exaggerating to the extreme.
---
Plus somehow people don't like hunters getting 1500+ extra mana per minute all raid long.
---
When the sun rises on the fifth day, look into the East
---
20% is kinda huge. If you where talking 5-10% it would be reasonable. Also warriors have offensive cool downs that work super well in the 1minute boss fights and just get better with gear. Issue with ret is your not getting gear over a warrior or mage. So the gap will get even bigger.
---
Mark of tyranny is a druid only thing.
---
I'd say you're ready to start farming things you will have to farm anyway on 60 so you might as well do it while it also gets you XP. You didn't mention your class, but if you play as a cloth class, you will need a lot of felcloth from Satyrs in Felwood, BTD arena runs are also important for many classes, or rep grinding depending on what professions you have to get the more valuable recipes.
---
To me 50s felt really fast because I could just stop thinking about things in levels and XP bars.
---
Very true, it does seem to be quite hit or miss, considering how short fights are we're really not seeing the full benefit without multiple Annihilators in the raid. 
---
For longer fights it's worth it imo.
---
I don't think it's accurate either, for example, Vanilla era comments from wowhead prove that Frozruk is not supposed to be linked to his adds and that you should be able to pick them out one by one.
---
We have a famous warrior that reserves orbs and has ony trinket on our server 😂
---
People that camp lowbies should be banned
---
What if a enh shaman talent could be something like: All threat your totems cause will be redirected to you. Mitigation is another problem, yeah, but threat would nearly not be an issue anymore with a well placed fire nova totem/magma totem
---
What ? You mean the mobs are using proper positioning, and having the tanks in front of the raid leader ?
---
Nahhhh.
---
I would suggest you find one of the servers me and thousands of others have used since BC wasn't available and go do a Heroic, where it's very optional.
---
And sure, we can argue they don't have the numbers spot on, but I highly doubt (as with Classic) that it's that much different.
---
Yeh, I just don’t want people to think they are going to be making 50 gph on US servers, it’s closer to about 25-30g.
---
Can you hibernate someone who has been polymorphed?
---
Because if you're mid pull blizzard is more expensive to cast and less effective for the same result. Cone will put you down nearly 60% less mana than blizzard, only cost you 1 global, and allow to keep moving. Blizzard can be pushed pack, interrupted, straight up ignored sometimes and targeting it can be quite awkward in some areas in dungeons thanks to low ceilings, invisible walls and various outcroppings and objects.
---
Yeh but at the same time when you go to buy them they only cost 10s!
---

I'm gonna try to make it work for myself in 5 mans again. Racking up some sweet mail gear and dodge jewelry. Not there yet, but looking forward to tank some 5 mans. Will be main resto anyways.
---
Oh no, 2 downvotes by some losers who are still 30 after 2 months, what are we gonna doooo
---
Whew mate, nobody cares about yours either.
---
%tldr: No, they left me stranded on stalagg and I bounced around a bit before xferring to heartseeker and I expect to be staying in the first guild I joined here for the duration. Full story below.
---
First guild I found on Reddit in early August. Seemed like cool people with similar lifestyles and maturity. I enjoyed launch with them and leveling a bit. I started to no life it and they were falling behind. I was able to log in before peak times and they got stuck in massive queues so they decided to reroll on another sever. I was already close to 30 while many of them hadn’t reached 20 so i wished them the best and they left stalagg the first week.
---
So I was a marooned on a server that was becoming increasingly more horde dominated. I hit up another Paladin i chatted with regularly about progress and completed my verigans fist quest with and he invited me to join his guild. I really didn’t have much connection to the guild and nobody seemed to be grouping or talking much in /g, honestly don’t remover the name of that guild. 
---
So after guild 1 left me I left guild 2 to join with some people who I really enjoyed slogging through gnomer twice with for quest runs. They were super friendly and helpful to eachother and shared my attitude toward wow. I had a lot of fun leveling with them and got to 60 in that guild. We had a scheduled raid coming up and it did not look like we would be able to even field half a full squad of 55+. I wanted to start raiding ASAP so I looked for a guild that was raid ready and for my schedule so I joined guild 3 and cleared Ony and 8/10 MC that week.
---
Guild 3 was more serious about pre-bis and farming and it felt more like what I remembered enjoying about playing tbc back in the day. They were experienced players and very fun to play with. Tons of jokes in /g and commarsderie. The next week we cleared all raid content including a first attempt Rag. 
---
By this point second set of transfers were being announced and stalagg was tilting ever more toward horde domination and the higher level zones weren’t as safe as they used to be as the masses caught up to 60. BRD was a nightmare getting into due to its terrain UBRS was pretty much impossible and once the horde started camping the entrances to the mountain itself I knew stalagg was done for. Also I heard that more than a few of the decent alliance guilds left the server so the ratio was almost 70% horde
---
I looked in the discord for heartseeker picked a guild that was about raid ready and needed paladins. It’s been the perfect fit. Bailed on stalagg Sunday night before transfers ended. Too bad heartseeker is so alliance heavy but I’m happy with my guild and my server now.  Thanks for reading if you got this far.
---
Well they hinted they will maybe release TBC and then we will see. I am just telling you my experience.
---
Yea I stopped using defaults because of this despite not using any raid frame addons on retail. If you're a healer and need to keep groups together, it gets even worse.
---
Get any addon - grid, luna frames, vuhdo etc.
---
As the first person stated, better than twilight. It's an expression right? and i tried to do a wordplay thing. meaning its a good romance, but after that there's twilight.
---
maybe it just works better in my own language
---
English is my third language so please don't down vote me for trying to play with words.
---
You know why it matters. You're saying "why does it matter enough to warrant assblasting hybrids", which to be honest I don't even really see that much here. Mostly just people saying; "enjoy the game whichever way you want but realize you'll have more difficulty finding raids when you play a hybrid"
---
Going straight for those emerald cheeks, I see 😜
---
Implying DPS ever waits for anything before going ham.
---
Oomies 
---
Haha! first time I've heard them called that.
---
You saved JarJar Binks!
---
What Server is this? :O
---
Made me chuckle. Not even 40 yet myself so I feel the pain
---
If you just fear it and forget it yeah then its an awful cc, but if you actually try you can use fear as an amazing cc. So the most obvious is pulling the mob far far back and just fearing it where you have cleared right, but lets say that isn't an option due to mob skipping or whatever. Alright so you have rank 1 curse of recklessness what this does is make the mob immune to fear but it doesn't remove the fear off the mob. So what you can do is put recklessness on the mob when you want it to come back to you  and then switch the curse to any other curse rank 1 or otherwise and it'll instantly be feared again.  
---
Hope this helps as warlock fear is one of the most amazing and versatile cc that is heavily under utilized properly.
---
Did it occur to you that the readon they are killing this boss in 25 seconds in the first place is because the melee uses arcane pots and is therefore able to dps?
---
On horde side thanks to WF totem rogues and fury warrs are by a long shot the best dps.
---
I mean, sure, you can kill it with just ranged. Just like you can do all of MC with highly suboptimal specs, gear and strategy. Because tier1 raids are a joke and were designed to be easy.
---
That attitude is fine and all, until you want to progress in BWL. Then your guild falls short on everything, dies on Vael for a few resets and disbands.
---
It doesn't look it it would make a top tier twink weapon, so at best I imagine it will sell for like 5g, maybe 10g. If you're saving for a mount, I'd say put it up there for 15-20g just to see if someone really wants it that bad, and if not, you're probably better off equipping it.
---
Actually I did in the beginning weeks it's still in my bank cause I'm not 300 engi yet
---
It snowballs thou. If you have 2 dps in equal gear, one in a raid where the boss dies in 3 min and one where the boss dies in 30 seconds, the later will have their CD durations active the entire fight. Having big dps increases everyones dps. Melting a boss with dps CDs  vs relying on mana preservation and sustain 10 bosses a raid 2 nights a week for a couple years... pretty big chasm.
---
i mean, there is reserving and reserving. I know a warrior who, when he reserve an item, for compensation, don't roll need on others the other warriors/paladins would need (including somes he actually need).
---
He prefer sharing the loot than taking the risk to have it all or none.
---
Is freezing band really worth the 400-500g?
---
Good question, no idea. I would say no just because I have never seen it.
---
Could be totally wrong though
---
What! That is awesome, thank you! :D
---
I'm the rogue in the video and it's actually my recording. We were playing around with different engineering trinkets and I had just swapped back to the death ray after waiting for the cooldown to end. It looks dumb in the video, I know... I should make some proper trinket macros and hotkeys :P
---
Wouldn't Shamans be technically removed as well for being pagans? Or Druids?
---
Oh wow,some guild should definitely try that
---
I main tank my guilds 1hr 30 min clears as a feral Druid.
---
What's the go-to raiding spec? I'm looking for a spec that gets me looking reasonable in MC but still allows me to farm lashers or ZF or something.
---
No it's not needed. I've run it around 25 times and only had it resist feign death once.
---
Lightning Reflexes talent isn't really used in PvE or PvP. It requires very specific gear and buffs to work.
---
I think I read that once you reach 350 agi the bonus agility talent out performs trueshot aura.
---
Shamans def dont belong in the evil slot. Not sure who goes there, but that one sticks out to me
---
The main trick is — switch to resto.
---
We run 2 raids and the second group where I am in has seen 2! Priest set drops so far in multiple weeks of MC. Not that T1 Priest is good, but still.... at least we got 2 T2 heads on our last Onyxia kill.
---
Try finding Stranglekelp, it's even worse for me
---
i also use and like AUX, but one thing I think it lacks, is price history.
---
I would love to be able to watch the last 2 weeks prices for an item, day by day.
---
Frost mage all the way.
---
licensing issues, they're working on making a new one from scratch.
---
Zg &gt;;D
---
Now what's the thing with beggars invading reddits.
---
Beggars when I get home from work, beggars when I chill in Ironforge and now, bloody beggars while browsing reddit.
---
What a plague.
---
Proud that horde players are breaking the rules? Okay. Hope you do the same and get banned too.
---
For now I’m also tanking often but resto not until 60 Right now I do a fair bit of questing and for that I prefer feral.
---
It doesn't for now. Fights end in 30 seconds.
---
They won't further down the line. And then it will matter. And then you have a guild full of fun hybrids with tons of outdated gear that cant do shit except carry alts through MC to get gear f o r them so you can actually kill bosses.
---
I've just hit 60 on my Holy Priest and ran MC with my guild on Tuesday.  The addons I were using were HealBot, DeadlyBossMods and ElvUI .  The only additional addon I wish I had taken was Decursive which just makes dispels so much easier.  
---
I'd definitely say that HealBot, DeadlyBossMods and Descursive are required.  ElvUI is QOL and I like the way it looks :)
---
Yea this sub is absolutely filled with new players spamming mediocre logs on favourable bosses not realising MC is probably the easiest raid to ever have existed.
---
Nah, but gnomes get kicked at 18.
---
Report them for safe spotting and put in a separate ticket every time they kill you.
---
I would love to just Switch to Alliance.. since all friends at Horde stopped playing, besides one Bit at the wrong side^^
---
but thats not an Option yet, do you think it will be possible in the Future?
---
I heard somehwere that epics from earlier phases won't give nexus shards
---
They have too many people "leading" the raid plus it is horrible.
---
Is it worth dumping the 450g+ you'll need to get the mats for RotA or should you try to farm the essences yourself?
---
Rogue lvl 51. Professions skinning @300 and leatherworking @180ish. Need some motivation to lvl up leatherworking since i‘m having a hard time to gather the materials needed.  I don‘t want to buy them at the ah though. Is there anything I can craft myself at a higher profession lvl that I cannot get from a dungeon pre-raid?
---
"Send back the captured ones!" 
---
\*rains down heads into the city\*
---
"Perfection!"
---
Also, if you're on EU and stuck on a dead realm, like Judgement, there are free transfers still open to the Spanish EU realm.
---
Yes, I realise it's Spanish, but, they are very friendly on Mandokir and there are a load of English speaking guilds and players there who took the option to move rather than stay on a dead realm (or move from an absolutely packed one). 
---
Mandokir has a healthy economy, shit actually sells and there's shit to buy with a lot of guilds clearing MC/Ony and at least 5 well known weekly pug runs to MC/Ony (Horde) - 3 being run by primarily English only speakers. 
---
Do it before the window closes and you're forever stuck on a dead realm with a dead economy and waiting for Blizzard to really do anything about it.
---
Here it is.

---
I prefer the imp healing wave over Healing Focus because I hate the 3sec cast Healing Waves.  
---
I am lvl 56, so I don't have the Purification talents yet, but I heal DM East and BRD rather easily with a non-tarded tank and some semi-blue gear. Can also DPS rather ok-ish, and I do not struggle solo. I might spec deep resto eventually, but right now, I need to be able to quest to get to 60, but I might stay with this spec on 60 aswell..
---
Sidenote: I was 5th out of 9 healers on Sulfuron Harbinger and Golemagg kills on wednesday (at lvl 56). So the build isn't all bad for dungeons.
---
Now that you mention it I rechecked the comment and it's from Patch 2.0.12.
---
So I am guessing it was either same in Vanilla or TBC actually made it easier.
---
Considering I played a warlock for 14 years, I'm not really requesting your idea of how to play the class. I know what Fear can do and how you can utilize it, but that doesn't change the fact that you're using an inferior CC to pretty much anyone else in the game - and that's okay. Classes should be different like that.
---
Yeah, they are below most vendor value of the blues :(
---
There's no exclusive benefits for being LW besides getting a bit of gold from salt shaker cooldown, because everything you can craft you can also buy from other players. It's nice to have your name engraved on the items you (and others) wear, but can't really put a price tag on that.
---
There's some profits to be made from crafting devilsaur set and hide of the wild, but it might take a while to make back the gold spent on leveling LW and obtaining patterns, and profit margins will decrease over time.
---
You need "large seaforium charge" to blow a door inside the instance, if you're a hunter.
---
I suggest you watch a video "hunter solo tribute classic".
---
okay man whatever you say
---
Crest of supremacy drops from eranikus in ST. Should get you into BRD req lvl 51
---
Posts like this are exactly one of the reasons wow became what it is today in retail over years and years. It’s not bad luck, it’s by design. Stop crying and enjoy the game for what it is.
---
Druid was also far worse at the beginning. Remember, we went through 12 patches of class balance; druid in 1.12 isn't far off from druid in tbc statwise, it's more the itemization that makes it a tad harder.
---
1 Feral tank is still great to have, and several tryhard guilds bring one along like skarm's
---
Barring emergency situations, switching between healing and dps is strictly incorrect. You should be specced for one, meaning efficiency is trash in the other. If you don't agree with this you haven't played long enough to see bosses live under 1% where a single player min maxing would've changed the outcome. 
---
Also, these posts are almost never talking about hybrid classes in general. It's just a guise for spriests and ret to justify being invited.
---
All this said, MC is the easiest raid that has ever existed. If you want to take hybrids go ahead, but absolutely best wishes to you and your repair bills during future raids.
---
He won't.
---
Auctioneer has suited me fine. TSM obviously has much more features, but tbh, I just wanna dump whatever I have on the AH and be done with it. Don't really care that much.
---
Depends on if you want the best PvP ring in the game for frost mages
---
[here is my attempt](https://i.imgur.com/rhIGhxE.jpg)
---
Meanwhile our guild has 5 druids to the point where we had 1 go boomkin because we really don't need that many resto druids (1 is a feral OT).
---
Brd is useless for leveling  it usually gives you below 25k exp/h. Except for magecleaves.
---
DM wasnt out yet when I was below level 60.
---
You are an asshole. I shall now dedicate my life to ganking you every chance I get. 
---
Prepare for INFICAMP!
---
We are looking for everything. Best would be a tank and a heal though.
---
This is so wholesome. I love it
---
Took me 35 runs to get the Healing Neck from Ramstein in Strat. To get it to drop that is. You have a 99.7% chance to have seen it drop by then.
---
Sometimes RNG gives, sometimes he takes away. Such is life.

The paladin role in wow Classic is to support. Here's my thought as retpals in PvP (I'm a 90% PvP player)
---
If you played Heroes of the Storm, think about Uther : he's exactly what retpaladins are : you can damage (not much, but that's decent) you can heal, you can throw very helpful buffs, but you are neither the killers retpals were in 3.0 nor the ultimate healer.
---
Honnestly, I love this gameplay, even though the retpal from LK is the one I loved the most. You can make very scary crits, you will be loved for your BoP's and Freedom, you'll save your healer's ass, dispel many annoying sheeps, blinds and dots...The other day, I was on my feral reroll with my pally buddy, level 31 and 35, and we killed groups of 3-4 hordies by simply healing eachother and occasionally bursting a target. We were supposed to gain exp, and we ended up roaming thousand needles killing countless hordies. We couldn't have done it without the paladin's freedoms, heals and huge crits (and the feral's mobility though).
---
That's cool, I will check it out. Is it easy to install and configure for WOW?
---
I don't think you can. Even level 40 bosses can be difficult to face tank solo, let alone level 50. The only classes that can manage are usually those who can kite the bosses while also dealing a decent amount of damage. Your best bet would probably be to get into Mara and ask in general chat if anyone is currently farming the dungeon for gold. Most people who do usually have a side hustle of bringing people inside for about 15-20g until the ring drops. You don't really cost them anything as long as you pass on all other drops and don't cost them too much time.
---
Thing is, there's one here from 1.4.2:
---
&gt; First we killed one of his minions with massive burst damage (fire spec mage, imp, DoTs), then retreated until they all deaggroed. Repeat for second and third minion. 
---
So did they change it by the time 1.12 rolled around and then change it back for BC..?
---
resto or feral?
---
Black desert online. Korean MMORPG. Entirely different from wow and western mmos. Learn about it but I wouldn’t suggest anyone play it. The whole game is grinding and RNG and designed to get players to use Real money transactions
---
I'm sorry for your bad experience in a pvp server, I guess you should take responsability for creating a character on such a server. If you think people can be mean and griefing, it means some probably are.
---
For this reason, I've rolled on a pve server. I'm now level 54 and I've never pvp'd; not feeling the urge to do it, either. If I wanna pvp, I can /duel somebody I guess (the only fair way!)
---
Stay away from brm ;) but when BWL arrives, you will come back!
---
This one was on you, NEVER assume anything in pugs and ALWAYS discuss loot rules beforehand.
---
Whenever Phase 2 comes out should we expect to see world PvP on the PVE servers at high levels?
---
Please no. I soloed the first boss Guard Mol'dar 27 times before I had the Sublime Wristguards drop. It was good gold from all the trash the dogs drop + boss loot, but now even the thought of DM north makes me nauseous.
---
Pretty great advice here!
---
Min-maxing isn't the problem, in fact I think it's a sensible and fun thing to min-max yourself, but THAT is the key, people are imposing their attitude on how another person is playing.
---
I'm quite enjoying trying to be the best DPS I can be, but I don't judge myself against how well a druid can tank or a shaman with enhancement spec can heal.
---
Good morning Mages of Reddit! I'm Seksi, the Mage guide author for [Icy Veins Classic](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/). Here to answer all of your WoW Classic Mage questions, and also to ask for feedback that can improve my guides, as writing is as much of a journey as playing, always something new to learn!
---
**Spotlighted Content and current Mage Guide Roadmap:**
---
* The [Mage Leveling Guide](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/classic-mage-leveling-guide) has a detailed page for everything leveling related (with the text and images dynamically adjusting based on your selected level) for Frost single target and AoE. I'm currently working on making separate pages for Fire and Arcane, which are currently TL:DR'ed in the general page. Also looking to improve / detail on the AoE spots recommended.
---
* The [Mage Introduction Page](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/mage-dps-pve-guide) presents some of our strengths and weaknesses, racials and races that can be Mages, and a quick TL:DR on professions.
---
* My [Mage Builds and Talents Page](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/mage-dps-pve-spec-builds-talents) talks about some of our most popular end game PvE talent builds, and goes into detail on some of our most iconic / misunderstood talents. Looking to expand it with more (Fire) builds once we are past MC and BWL!
---
* Made a [Mage Best in Slot List](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/mage-dps-pve-gear-best-in-slot) with the best items I could find for each slot that are available in WoW Classic right now, without or with raid gear, and some notable Fire Resistance items you can use for Ragnaros or PvP. Will be adding more items as Phases continue, but a bit torn on what to do with PvP gear in Phase 2...a lot of it is obviously best in slot (especially the epic armor and weapons of the final ranks) but will be extremely hard for most people to acquire. Maybe I should do a new, separate listing that includes PvP gear also?
---
* The budding [Mage PvP Guide](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/classic-mage-pvp-guide) is very much a work in progress and a lot will be added / change until Phase 2 arrives. Need to add PvP race information (although much of it is already on the introduction page), PvP gear recommendations, dueling recommendations, battleground tips, maybe some underhanded Phase 2-specific honor farming tips (camp the flightpaths? XD)...for now I focused on PvP talent builds that were used by popular PvP faces of the past (links to nostalgic videos included!) and some PvP consumables.
---
* Finally, but perhaps the most relevant activity for Mages right now, is my [Mage Gold Farming Guide](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/classic-mage-goldmaking-guide-the-best-ways-to-make-gold). Mages were literally made to be gold farmers in Classic, and the richest people everywhere are also Mages! This page is one of my highest priorities to update, as it is criminal that I did not have the time yet to talk at depth about Zul'Farrak and Dire Maul farming, which are making Mages rich everywhere! Expect updates on this this weekend the latest, all the juicy stuff that we have been taking advantage of for a while now :)
---
Mages are the best overall class in WoW Classic, in my humble opinion. The only thing they cannot do is tank and heal, but more than compensate with their damage dealing prowess and huge array of utility and area of effect / control spells. Really happy to have been given the opportunity to write, and hopefully help, people who want to try it, especially first timers! Thanks for reading.
---
Jokes on them, I was a devil worshiper before my first dnd campaign
---
I hear you, Darkshore is my best friend.
---
1 % crit is about equal to 29 points of ap
---
The staff is fine for open world content, instances and long boss fights... For shorter ones, I would use a weapon with more dps potential
---
 Ah. I didn't know unique was a thing. I didn't check (and can't right  now) to see if I already have the ring. I remember only one other run  through WC, and I don't remember the ring then. But my poor memory is a  more likely answer than a game glitch.
---
Yes
---
And it is still way superior to the DM trinket in PvP and for solo stuff because you're in melee hitting big raptor strikes all the time.
---
Yeah. OP should have made the loot rules clear in the beginning. It’s not uncommon for people to roll need on high value BoEs in pugs.
---
That sucks.. Happens way too much.
---
People just take Epic BOE's and expensive rare BOE's as "Gold" which everyone can roll for. Because they can sell and get their own BiS items. 
---
It sucks - but also makes sense in some way - and defenitely Needs to be discussed beforehand...
---
If you have a nice Group they'll leave it to you. In most cases though you will Need to be lucky :/
---
If you're tanking and you're not with people you know you should probably put a shield on. Makes it easier for everyone. That is if you're not fighting for threat with the dps. The only reason you'd need to dps/tank is if the dps can't manage their threat.
---
so just help guildies and expect nothing? :D
---
I am not sure because from this comment we could also assume that they retreated (while being linked) which could work if they burst one down fast and ran out of aggro range. It doesn't confirm the link though.
---
My name is BattCheeks. Im a expert in everything related to my charecter name.
---
Always remember to eat your greens!
---
Ahhh sounds like Koreans version of the iPhone App Store games meta xD
---
I heavily advice any new player to the class to go furyprot, especially for dungeons.
---
Either stay arms until you raid, op, as it does the most AoE threat with sweeping strikes, or go deep prot and try fury/prot once you're comfortable with the class and have good gear.
---
If you think Vael is an issue for any remotely decent guild because they bring a bunch of hybrids, you're an idiot. If anything, the infinite mana makes a lot of hybrid specs who suffer from bad mana issues better. This fight was hard 15 years back because people were terrible and played on terrible hardware.
---
I'm not saying you can kill him with 40 ferals, shadows and retris. But you can easily bring one or two of each and still down the boss unless you suck hard and need to ride fotm as hard as you can to compensate for your inability to play well.
---
the link doesnt link to the discord channel, just to discord in general
---
Before you do, you might want to look and see if they're intentionally not using bleeds because they've been told the debuff slots are reserved.
---
It's a huge loss to dps for a feral druid if they don't use their bleeds.
---
Otherwise, with bleeds, they should expect to be in top 5 dps on the likes on Onyxia.
---
The problem also is that feral druid gearing and improving your feral druid gear, stops at dungeons, there's little or nothing available from MC/Ony for feral so you can never improve your gear the way rogues can.
---
However, it's not all about dps as you should know as a feral tank, Druids bring a lot more to a raid as feral.
---
Check their specs also, they might be more spec'd toward feral tanking than dps.
---
Forest leather belt!
---
It sounds like you already have a pretty good attitude towards playing warrior. That gear dependence is a blessing in disguise. While leveling it is nice to occasionally feel power spike when you upgrade to a new weapon, but on 60 when everything is about gear you will be an absolute powerhouse in both PvE and PvP because you get more out of your high-end gear than all other classes.
---
I’m still at my 40s, but I like wasting time. We all know what’s at the end so why rush it?
---
I don't think it's slow!
---
I'm 54, almost 55 myself. I've also got herb and alch 300, while others are in the 240+
---
Go at your own pace, do what you like.
---
For me, I made a plan to level in certain areas: tanaris, hinterlands, searing gorge, tanaris, hinterlands (elite), felwood, ungoro. Still got stuff to do in ungoro for now, then I'll prob go to the burning steppes and winterspring. I think I will ding 60 before finishing the q in all these zones. Oh well! We'll see.
---
Have fun! and have a great weekend!
---
Doubt it. Some may try city raiding but that's a chance for dishonorable kill. People will wait for BGs.
---
I'm level 60, but none of my IRL friends are over 50 (44-49). You're doing fine.
---
World pvp, the white nightsaber, farm gold, min/max your proffs, got all patterns/receipts?
---
Cant speak for shaman, but having one shadow priest in group to buff your warlocks is entirely reasonable I would say. My guild just recruited one recently.
---
Yeah that is how they balanced the classes in TBC and wotlk by giving them various debuffs and stuff to make them more attractive to have (on top of actually giving them decent dps or tanking abilities). Iirc there wasnt any really dogshit useless class/spec in those two expansions (the only expection that pure dps classes often had just one dps spec and in 10man heroics some classes were not really great).
---
Why in hell were they looking for a dedicated tank then? Only explanation is they failed by trying it or really believe from their own experience, that they won't make it without a dedicated tank. Both tells me it will be a rough ride.
---
Until you casually run in burning steppes and some hunter demon one shot you on the road. Fuck you hunters i will screw with all demons you tamper. Leave demons to us warlocks
---
I haven't seen a single post suggesting people roll need for vendor values. Comparing that to needing BOE epics that sell for 20x the value is just dumb.
---
I'd say Warlocks (especially / namely of the soul link kind) are by far our worst nemesis. They have huge magical resists leading to less damage output from the Mage, have insane health making it a challenge to kill them before we run out of Mana (literally can just run around meleeing us and doing nothing due to this, sometimes) and we cannot even cast Frostbolt or other efficient nukes because of being disrupted and interrupted by Felhunter or Fear, so its basically spam AoE and pray that somehow you do a lot of damage. If they can use Healthstone its basically impossible as that makes their health even higher!
---
Heh, not surprised you're a druid. All I see in MC and Ony are druid set items. Grats though.
---
It's because hybrid specs can easily heal dungeons with a dps spec. My ele shaman doesn't even need different gear.
---
On top of that people have no problem with inviting lower level healers for their dungeon group, increasing the pool of healers even more.
---
This. It also shows overheal which is pretty satisfying.
---
They went to far with the number of linked mobs tho.  Usually it was only quest bosses and such that had linked guards.  Everything else could be separated.
---
I got most myself, few bought. Fire from BRD and UnGoro elementals, water fished from azshara/farmed in epl lake, earth mostly from ungoro stone guardians, some from silithus, air from silithus etc...
---
AHAHA what you basically said is that you'd rather outperform special ed kids to validate your choice of trash class. Jeeeesus this thread is validating my decision to never invite meme classes.
---
If you are interested in PvP you should stock up on potions and gear for phase 2. If not there's really no content left for you. All you can do is experience the content in a different way. Whether that be through an alt or speedrunning or helping other players or whatever it doesn't matter just a new way to do old things.  
---
On the other hand is it a bag thing to only play a few hours a week? You can always play another game or read a book or find something else to occupy your time then come back when new content is released. You don't have to spend all the free time you have playing wow.
---
A guildy of mine was looking for an elemental LW for weeks, since everyone goes for tribal (devilsaur stuff). It might be worth to go that  path for less competition and potentially more gold to be made. Lots of people need fire resist gear now.
---
“He only did 90% more damage than I did, so we’re about even.”
---
There are odd trinkets you can get like the bolts off of Rammstein. Nagelring is another good alternative if you are wanting more thorns effects.
---
0.73 DPS isn't quite a large margin IMO, especially when losing 0.63% Crit and 0.63 Dodge.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5815/glacial-stone#comments:id=2675498
---
Someone was nice enough to do the calculations for us a while back
---
Cleared mc from beginning of mc to end of wrath every week no bindings. Got my left binding week 2...they're everywhere
---
Feral tanks are worthless in any raids as anything other than emergency off tanks or if they build (and the guild helps them build) a fire resistance tanking set.
---
They cannot deal with crushing blows and cannot become crit immune due to lack of +def gear.
---
No amount of armour and stamina stacking will help, no matter how many feral tanks big up themselves. They're a wasteful drain on the healers mana. 
---
Off tanks only and only for specific fights, unless as I said, they build a really high FR tanking gear set and even then it's just for a few bosses. 
---
Feral Druids are better as feral dps primarily, who can skip into an off tank emergency roll. 
---
That or Resto, simple as.
---
Maybe he achieved exactly what he wanted ;)
---
That's a huge amount though!
---
I read through that interview and I would like to take this time to thank you for your patience in this discussion. Most people turn to insults rather than facts to resolve discussions and despite your first comment I felt this was overall positive.
---
Next time, it may be helpful to start off with that link and quotes from your post above.
---
Good luck!
---
I'm at almost 120 runs now.......
---
This is of epic proportions my guy
---
what did you expect, it's the internet, it's reddit, you should only come here with 0 expectations
---
The cause of your problem is triggered by your behavior in game. If you don't kill all the respawn location for your specific mob, they will be taken by other mobs, reducing your change of seeing your quest mobs, forcing you into bad positioning because of your greed.
---
Don't try to cheese the game constantly.
---
Pls explain, too casual (and not enough time) to do raids
---
Farm for dal'rends that will take up another few months of your time.
---
I'm constantly deep frost and it works just fine, especially when arcane/frost mages happy from winters chill. 
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?talent#of0VoZZVAMIsfzAo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#of0VoZZVAMIsfzAo)
---
If there is other mage with winters chill you can go for shatter if you really want to.
---
You'll probably see groups of flagged players hoping to find some solo fool who flagged himself.
---
If you're the kind of player that wants WPvP you rolled on a PvP server.
---
What is your threshold for when an item should be rolled on by everyone then? The only justification I have seen for rolling on BOEs is that "everyone needs gold", so where is your line?
---
Yeah, seeing that. If it's not clearly reserved beforehand, just need everything.
---
They implemented a different way to do it a month ago: https://twitter.com/TSMAddon/status/1173892162171392000
---
Instead of sourcing from a blizzard API it sources it by sharing the scans of everyone using TSM and the desktop app. Of course there could be some spoofing with this method but that should be uncommon for any reasonably common item sold to remove outliers. You should still do local scans daily, but so far the average region market values have been pretty consistent for commodities and common green/blue gear.
---
You're missing the point. He said he left be ause their unwillingness to tank indicated to him that they are bad at their clasd. Why would he want to tank for two other warriors? They're the worst class to tank for, take his loot and don't even bother to step up and tank when it benefits themselves. Why carry them?
---
You can demand more from the ele shams you play with if you regularly beat them in dungeons. They are doing something wrong. Or its a gear thing.
---
All the other three were very easy. I did wipe a few times on Silithus but it would have felt really bad to accept any outside help.
---
The problem with the Silithus one was I was trying to do it the intended way which just kept resetting him randomly. Once I simply kited him on the terrain I got it in 2 pulls. Not sure if it's working as intended but it was super frustrating to just have him reset in the middle of a fear.
---
Omg the people of isreal are undead!
---
Its all about stat prioritization. For PvE, Spell Damage / Hit and Crit are absolute kings, especially in our current knowledge meta that makes fights be extremely short: you will never run out of Mana or be caught by unexpected damage, so Intellect, Spirit and Stamina are borderline useless.
---
On the other hand, for AoE Grinding and in PvP, your Mana pool is your lifeline, and if it runs out you lose by default, so Intellect is very important, and Stamina as well because you cannot kill when you are dead, and a lot of incoming damage will be unavoidable due to the nature of these activities.
---
Why would you expect the majority of posts to be information when that information is already readily available, of course people are going to make new content, even if it's shit
---
Valor head and shoulders, and Skull Flame Shield. looks like he's also might be using nearly the whole valor set.
---
I am a father, full-time teacher with hopes of becoming 60 before mid-January, no time for silly alts. When I reach 60  I can start playing the game. :P
---
Man it’s been 14 years since I’ve played vanilla and i don’t remember the rules about this kind of thing then, but I can tell you what I consistently see now, if it’s a BOE then rules need to be laid out or else it’s free game. Why? Well because it’s BOE, and you just as easily as the priest could have left the dungeon and sold that piece on the AH, and that’s why you establish loot rules. Also that doesn’t sound like you were ninja’d either, just bad circumstance and even worse RNG
---
Nice explanotory video, but having done this run hundreds of times myself I have to question the gold values you come up with.
---
40-50g an hour seems more like the optimal than the average.
---
I ran 26 hours worth of Mara over a 3 day weekend and kept a spreadsheet of my vendor gold for each hour. Came up with an average of 31,67 gold pr hour. Are you calculating with being able to sell the ring when you come up with 40-50g?
---
I’ve never seen anyone advocate rolling need on bop items for vendor value. Ever.  
---
Everyone needing on a boe item that may go for hundreds of gold is completely not the same thing, at all.
---
Im in the same position but im still farming gold every day, gotta prepp early for aq/naxx and ranking in p2/p3 is gonna be expensive aswell, vanilla is not a raidlog game.
---
Let me introduce you to the mythical concept of the paladin tank.
---
Onyxia from my Mage POV: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTMZVuHdvLo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTMZVuHdvLo)  nothing to spectacular ;)
---
Even though it's not a pvp server, is there still world pvp?
---
I think I've been using the retail version on Classic since its release. Classic version  here [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/dynamiccamclassic/files](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/dynamiccamclassic/files)

You can heal in feral spec with healing gear. As tank or healer you find groups way quicker. If you do go as cat, Fairy Fire and just shred I guess. Dont know when/if ferocious bite is worth it. Keep an eye on any adds that escape the tank, you can keep them of the healer by switching to bear. Also look at your healers mana, if he/she is nearing oom, help out by healing/innervating.

Please tell me dwarfrogue is a gnome mage
---
This thread is so informative
---
Thank you for this! I didn't see it, luckily a guildie caught it and showed me :) 
---
So cool
---
I'm aware druid is normally healing me on it. We normally 4 man with a war and mage where we will do anger 4x and then on the 5th kill some other crap and maybe lava hop to emp to kill time and not have ironfoe drop
---
Garr has a bunch of elemental adds. They all pull together and they and the boss all hit hard and they have a pretty big amount of hp. Warlocks can banish elementals, making them immune to damage but unable to move or attack for the duration. The normal strategy is to banish a bunch of them so the tanks don't have to tank them all.
---
Pretty sure nothing will ever happen to them.
---
A lot of people go deep arcane with points in frost. I prefer deep frost so I can pvp and farm safely while still being able to do decent pve damage: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#of0E00bZZVVMhsftho

You cant go to the bathroom! Youre stacking Sunder Armor!

Ppl want heals or tank not a dudu lol dps
---
"dwarfs need food"
---
It may seems strange, but people don't like to be blacklisted from certain modes they want to just because their class is straight-up worse than others in every role.
---
all 3 are good
---
Do you play female characters as well?
---
That's one of the reasons I don't understand Rets. You can get BoK and Improved BoM without being a Ret, and Sanctity Aura only benefits yourself and perhaps a pally tank in your group - if you're not using Fire Resistance anyway.
---
And I don't know how people enjoy being an autohitter with the occasional Seal of Command proc, which occurs not too often, and otherwise stuck on using Consecration. The only micromanagement is watching your Vengeance to use Cons. Isn't that boring as hell? Sigh. But who am I to judge. Maybe it's relaxing. And thanks to bubble you should be one the last melees standing. To be fair I like the concept of SoC, but when you don't get an extra hit for a long time it really sucks. I could only enjoy being a "dps" in undead/demon dungeons.
---
As for myself, I'm just a Holy Pally from the start, and have 3/3 Righteous Fury for the occasional tanking. 
---
As you said, Enhancers at least come with improved totems. Shadows buff shadow damage. Druids have LotP or Moonkin Aura. I respect that tradeoff. Less dps but more buff potency or even unique buffs or auras. But Rets? Duh.
---
I felt bad for an arms warrior when a ret won the Obsidian Edged Blade. The same ret even won the Crown from Ragnaros. Oof.
---
How does spell damage effect the damage that a spell does? It sounds like a really stupid question when I phrase it like that, but if I'm a warlock and my shadow bolt does 300 damage, and I put on a felcloth robe which increases my shadow damage by up to 36, what happens? What if I put on a robe that increases ALL spell damage by 36, is it the same?
---
I agree
---
What are you doing in strat with a hat from SM?
---
We are absolutely not, the difference is more like 50%+ from class to class depending on the boss.
---
There are many logs out there and the difference between retri and mages on some bosses are 50%.. and don't even get me started on oomkins or elemental shamans .. 
---
Yes... you can clear the whole game without an optimal 40man class raid, 
---
But then the 40 people in that raid has to accept you being there, being a burden and not carrying the weight of one whole player. 
---
Which is okay if people agree with that.
---
Why are there so many people in this Thread pissed because you don't pvp?
---
This is where the MMO aspect comes in, the proper way to get difficult items like this is to have a core group who will learn and optimize a farming run, then when everyone who needs that farm has what they need, move onto the next persons farming run. For our group, once I have HOJ (last of 3 people to get it) I think we'll be moving onto running Vectus for his Shadow Damage neck for our Shadow Priest.
---
Oh okay, cool.
---
They should be DPS spec (I'm MT feral). 
---
I have to ask them about this stuff - but I know in general you can have a good rotation with wolfshead but they don't have this item. I wonder how competitive feral DPS is without it?
---
That is true, endgame now is so trivial you can get away with anything really.
---
Because time is limited. I'd rather clear MC/Ony in 2 hours and use the extra raid time to farm more pre-bis, mats for consumables or even level an alt. Most of the raid is on so getting guild groups going is easier too.
---
Thanks it's working perfectly! I mean I'll need to fiddle with the settings more, but it's already much better.
---
RemindMe! 10 hours
---
"The gang gets luny"
---
Oh, lit. Here I was thinking CC was garbage in raids (as it usually seems to be) but these are next level strats 😎
---
P.S. when I said I was too casual to raid, I meant in Vanilla. I do have a good knowledge of the game/classes (like warlocks having Banish Elemental), but raid mechanics (if there are any) are where I'm fuzzy haha
---
Expose doesn't stack with Sunder though no? So yeah if your tanks are good holding aggro without it then you could take imp expose sure.

1/25 roughly.

Yeah that's the whole point for the head \*not\* to be in the center -- just tested it and it works fine.
---
Oh, sorry, I forgot ...  
---
Level 60s killing level 20.  
---
5-man groups going around looking for single targets to kill.
---
Rogues waiting in stealth near quest mobs, waiting for somebody to be low on health, so they can 1-shot them.
---
I'm on a PvP server (because my vanilla guild wanted to be on one). Have probably died to alliance about a dozen times so far ... haven't seen anything resembling a fight yet. Closest was 3 level ~25s coming at me when I was solo at level ~20.  
---
Real PvP doesn't exist 'till battlegrounds, just like back in the day.
---
I unno. Seems fine.
---
Yes it is
---
i understand, i'm kinda in the same position. But i totally disagree about the game begeining at 60. For my part, i'm clearly not hurry to be 60. Having not much time to play can be streessing as you want to go forward as fast as you can. Since i stop doing this, i appreciate the game more.  
---
(sorry bad english + typing fast at work)
---
I wouldn't expect MCP off every druid but no they are not powershifting, that is probably the issue.
---
Well, if they wouldn't have a demon following  them :)
---
Oh my it does...
---
If it's BOE epic then everyone needs or everyone greeds. You're not entitled to drop alone just because you're a tank. You need it for your bis and you usually pay for it that 150g. If you would have gotten the drop them good for you because it's 150g less you need to pay later to get your bis.
---
The reason why other players can also roll for boe epics: they also have their own BIS lists and some items are expensive boes. They still need to buy them and chances are that none those BIS items every drop for them. Meaning, they would never be ''entitled'' to same ''freeloot'' as you think you'd have been just because they were unlucky. It's fair if everyone can roll for it and sell it so they can actually get an item they need.
---
In pugs: everyone needs. In other groups there might be different loot rules for BOEs. In my guild runs we sell those expensive items and split money and we always try to sell them a bit cheaper than from AH for our guild mate who actually needs it.
---
It would have been ninjaing if you discussed about loot rules before and you decided that everyone rolls greed on epics and then one steals it by needing. Another example of someone forgot masterloot on from previous boss (ensures that no one will steal the reserved item) and masterlooter takes the epic without letting anyone roll on it.
---
You're not the only one playing here and not everyone is supposed to help you out and sacrifice their time for you. The game is fun when you play with others and set no unfair rules.
---
It looks similar to gold selling if you just look at the classic wow side (though you probably won't trigger checks since I think they look more at the gold selling side, not buying), but they can obviously see that you traded on retail on the same account.
---
Warlocks and Spriests are unbeatable if played correctly. Everything else we can beat.
---
You're a village guard.
---
&gt;tly level 43 rogue and I am farming rock elementals in Badlands cause I noticed they respawn fast.  
---
&gt;However I am only getting around 10.000 
---
its kinda hard atm to grind on the good spots, like pirate camp in tanaris, waterholes in tanaris etc.
---
You could try hippogryphs in feralas, should yield like 20-40k xp/h 
---
Feralas - ruins of isilden about 30k xp/h
---
Tanaris - Ogres in the cave south of kargath
---
STV - Jungle stalkers.
---
News flash: not everyone cares about max efficiency.
---
Google "Spell Coefficients".  
---
IIRC for Shadowbolt - 3/3.5 - 85.71%
---
So your damage should be increased by 85% of +spell damage of item.
---
Mate, dungeons is a whole different matter. 
---
Raids are filled with bosses immune to different spell types, boss lasts longer and some hybrid classes will go oom.
---
You should fix the link in your post. [http://ironforge.pro/](http://ironforge.pro/) works
---
It's fine. I've learned my lesson. The world is full of greedy selfish people, and strangers should be treated as such until they prove otherwise.
---
I mean really, it was 150 gp he made versus 150 gp I saved, so all BoEs are just gold in the end.
---
I can see some argument that BoPs should only be needed to be worn, but really, they're going to be replaced and sold, so it's all just money in the end. I suppose in a raid it would matter, but anything before that should be fair game by this logic. Since there's a BoE BiS for pretty much any slot for any class, you just need to farm enough money to vendor to afford what you really want.
---
Stop lootwhoring and get over it... Rolling need on BoEs is fine, and that item was crap you shouldn't wear anyway.
---
I bet in-game that you're a leech
---
Yeah it's the same. Depending on the cast time, you get different modifers. Like a 3.5 second cast, you get 100% of your spell damage, and 2.5 you only get 70%, etc. Those numbers aren't exact but that's the gist.
---
See I get that but I'd rather have my hearth at Menethil harbor in that case depending on whether I want to end up closer to Darnassus or to Theramore, while allowing me to choose the docks. And even then I still feel Ratchet is a pretty ideal mid-point of the continent while also having useful access to the far south Booty Bay. One of my problems with Theramore itself is that pretty much its only adjacent zone is the Barrens, which isn't that useful to the Alliance. You can reach RFK and RFD from there, and I guess you could say it's one the closest areas to Shimmering Flats but if going Flats then I'd go Gadgetzan as there aren't many hazards on the road, as well as offering a bank (which Ratchet also does).
---
Farm pummelers to do equal dps to mages. I respect players who'll do that.
---
Oddly, this information wasn't freely known 15 years ago.
---
I agree, mostly just "now we can play the game" meme. I have always enjoyed the leveling the most. I just have a feeling if I don't get it done on winter break it might never happen. Most of my friends are 60 and would be nice to play tighter more. :)
---
What happens when BWL is released?
---
Farm gold, turn that gold into consumables in preparation for p2. Go do some actual PVP while you wait for p2. Help your guildies gear out, there's always someone who needs gear from instances...
---
Really dislike this spec. 
---
\- The pet is not on target most of the time against many matchups, be it because of fears, novas, or simply because it gets killed easily, so that's just 21 talents wasted if this happens. Bestial wrath is really needed to do damages with the pet.
---
\- A 3 sec stun is cool but you barely have any control over it. Sometimes, it tiggers 10 seconds after you actually want it... Not something I want.
---
\- Humanoid Slaying is much better in PvP than ranged weapons specialisation. If you do not seek to take Trueshot Aura, you should rather go for 21/27/3
---
\- Imp. Wing Clip, Entrapment and Counterattack are extremely powerfull, they give you the possibility to take initiative over opponents such as rogues and warriors. When rooted for 5 seconds, their next action is very predicable, allowing you to prepare for the next time they try to close the gap. For instance, just after I root a war, I step just enough to be in range for aimed shot, cast it, then immediately FD+Trap, I get 100% of the time intercepted but end up with a frozen, angry warrior before me. Against rogues, do the same but also flare between you and him. You might not be able to cast it full, but you might actually trap him, then you can aimed shot him.
---
It's fine for 5 man's ( except  oomkin lol they objectively suck).  And raids always have room for a couple carries but to say hybrid dps is comparable to a pure dps class is laughable and delusional.
---
Since you said Alts not an option the only advice I can think of is go farm a dagger set and have fun ambushing/backstabbing in pvp. The monotony of sword spec can make you not really feel like a rogue, farm a dagger set, respec after raid to imp backstab imp ambush and just have some fun. :)
---
One thing I'm curious about, and sorry if this sounds ignorant, is when would mages think about switching to a decent amount of investment into the arcane tree, like say the 31/0/20 build I've seen mentioned? A heavier initial invest into Frost seems useful for AoE grinding / crit stacking in the outside world, as well as if you ever end up in spellcleave dungeons (not that I'm advocating that but I do know mages do that sometimes). Is that build a raids respec? Or if going into frost is the 16/0/31 build better to aim for?
---
Tharal looks on in horror...
---
You can however skin both yetis and worgen lol
---
Actually you're pretty much completely wrong. 
---
No one gave a shit what spec you played in vanilla in MC/Ony content. Almost no one besides naxx raiders used DPS meters. You were accepted into a raid if you were:
---
A. A living breathing human being
---
B. Able to press a few abilities and follow simple instructions.
---
This idea that you need to even min max any of this shit is fucking laughable. It just goes to show what a bunch of try hards people are these days. 
---
Also, none of this content was hard back in the day and we had fucking dial up internet and absolute garbage pcs where it was a struggle to even walk round main cities. 
---
Literally no one played like people are now. No one. The people with 'bis' gear are just going to get 1 shot in bgs and they're going to have to farm an entirely new set. It's stupidity.
---
Mine is at 10 gold. If traveller's back drops everyone needs. If some silly blue boe drops I just greed and don't bat an eye if someone actually needs it. That being said, I haven't found a bop that sells for more than 10g for vendor. Thus I always greed bops unless it really is an upgrade.
---
There has been multiple times tho where warrior needs every single weapon (5 in one run) in scholomance as he says that it looks like he could use it. I'm sure they went to vendor but I usually call them out at the end of run. I tell them that if they really think it's an upgrade I can enchant each one of those weapons with crusader right now as long as he pays me the mats. After humiliating them they ignore me and ensure that I won't ever again run a dungeon with them. Cheap way to get rid of greedy people and they ruin their own reputation along the way.
---
Under 2 hours isn't even a speed run at this point. The top guilds are doing it in under an hour and the world record is under 20 minutes. Also, less wipes means less spent on consumables. 
---
Let's say you farm gold at a very conservative 25g/hr. If you spend just 2 hours farming after the raid you will have more than enough gold for your consumables for the following week. Compare that to making MC a 2 day 6 hour ordeal with wipe after wipe, constantly popping consumables. You can easily see how you want to spend the least amount of time actually raiding. 
---
Of course there's people who don't care about that and play the game however they wish. I'm just trying to explain how it's objectively better to try to speed up your raids.
---
Mik's works, though it doesn't show *all* overhealing (i.e. a hardcasted heal would show up as 0 (1234), but heal over time ticks would not show if they didn't do any actual healing).
---
Yeah pretty much, Spirit just doesn't act fast enough to shave off much of your drinking time off, at best its a stat that you can use without feeling too bad about it while leveling as long as you wand enemies off, but overall its probably faster to just finish them off with spells and drink for 1 second more lol.
---
Miks scrolling battle text is what I’ve been using since launch m, has a lot of functionality
---
Is the pool open though?
---
I doubt you actually played  the game, because this happened far, far FAR less than nowadays.
---
Is Freezing band the best ring in PVP?
---
There was no parade to shit on.
---
But that’s 12-16 dps altogether. Over a 5 minute foght, that is 3600-4800 damage. Which may or may not save the raid.
---
It’s maybe not the best talent, but no one seems to complain.
---
Also: I did not put 22 points in to get imp wf totem. I put 20 in it to get flurry to be able to solo quest more efficiently.
---
No need with Inventorian which does this by default
---
I made a dwarf pally named Ogham back in the day but decided to try horde for classic cause some friends wanted to go horde. They all stopped playing a few weeks ago and I couldn't do it anymore. It's never too late to see the light, friend. Keep yer feet on the ground!
---
It’s polite. They won’t get bombarded in game
---
Its a raid respec. In the short fights we have in Molten Core right now Arcane Power is bananas good and decidedly worth using. While leveling it is best that you use the builds presented in the leveling guide, which are better suited for soloing and AoE Grinding!
---
Yes. You can also use a [Unconscious Dig Rat](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5052/unconscious-dig-rat) to make a criter anywhere that you have a chance to get a doomguard from.
---
Our hybrid enhancement shaman is below our tanks on DPS every fight. When it is that embarrassing you should give up.
---
Isn't arms flat out a lot better while leveling since you miss so much as fury?
---
\*Showmemyheal
---
There you go - this is a great answer to this problem. A definitive value and clear set of rules for yourself. We can't make everyone roll the "right" way, but having something like this proposed is at least a start.
---
Oh I see. Yeah ClassicCodex is basically 1:1 port of pfQuest. The author made it work with 1.13, then stated he isn't interested in improving it further. He merges the odd PR every now and then, but the [last activity was about a month ago](https://github.com/project-classic/ClassicCodex/commits/master).
---
Oh well. Its not like I have any gold on Retail anyway. But I would rather Blizz was more clear on this sort of things so we don't have to go by what a couple of GM says.
---
Fast gun as BM, slow bow as MM
---
dal rends are better if you have both
---
&gt; It’s almost like players can’t be good and do better then average?
---
Considering classic has been simmed and parsed to high hell, no they really can't. There are very clear dps ceilings. Go watch a random "dps tiers on X raid in classic" some don't even mention paly , shaman or druid dps. Only healing.
---
If we're doing NEED rolls for gold, i think the one planning to do it should also be the one stepping forward before we start.
---
In general i expect to need on items giving me an upgrade.
---
I don't think Blizzard should intervene though, just black list this player, notify an officer of his guild and move on.
---
I'm coming up on 200 incendius kills for my bracers. Really bad gold, but I'm only missing the offhand and those bracers.
---
"HEY ARE YOU THE GUY FROM THE REDDIT SCREENSHOT!?"
---
Nobody's doing that, trust me.
---
I like the bow!
---
I know that those are different things so yeah I wasn't exactly correct in putting those together. Speed clears come with a completely different mindset of course. World record is over 30 minutes in classic afaik, the 17 minute clear was on private servers with gear that isn't available yet.
---
I understand well enough why people want to speed it up, been there before, but currently on classic I personally have no reason to rush, as long as it doesn't span to another day with the risk of not having enough players etc etc.
---
I'm gonna laugh when every raid in vanilla gets cleared day 1 by suboptimal comps. There are a lot of noobs here vastly overestimating the difficulty of latter bosses. The entirety of naxx is as mechanically difficult as normal raiding in BFA, which is considered easy mode.
---
I personally avoid bagnon since retail. It clunked my load time, too intensive per general on the game and the occasional errors. I love Inventorian out of the box and had no issues with it so far.
---
Someone got a warning in the first week for jumping on the roof to then jumping off in one continuously motion in Darkshire in Duskwood.
---
Death by snu snu!
---
Most of the time they aren't telling you not to play what you want, just dispelling misinformation.
---
Play what you want nobody here really gives a single fuck, just have fun, but just stop acting like what you're doing is optimal. There's alot of new people here and some of them just want to play what's in the highest demand, not some meme shit that will make it hard for them to find a group.
---
That YouTuber know what he is talking about when it comes to shaman. So nah, you are hot garbage.
---
Doesn't matter you're a gnome
---
Only really need to do it during prog tbh
---
The plan is to have my main a paladin with 
---
Alchemy and engineering 
---
While my hunter which is my alt will have herbalism and mining. 
---
Haven’t even hit 60 on the paladin yet
---
Lol don’t even waste a thought about crazy lefties.
---
Thanks sounds like I’m doing it about right then! I assumed I would get a few of those responses :)
---
Yeah if you don't plan on trying to make money from the handful of recipes currently available there's no reason to keep it if you'd rather have another money making profession for the time being.
---
Now you flex on Reddit!
---
Enjoy ClAssiC. BTW don't complain it is whAt you w@nted nO?
---
Thanks for the non-triggered reply. You're right, Crusader Strike was a much needed addition in TBC, as was Divine Storm in WotLK. When was Exorcism changed to work on all targets? I think there was also a passive which could reset it's cooldown. That when Ret slowly became more interactive to play with. I didn't like Holy Power though, felt like Combo Points.
---
Anyway, TBC finally gave prot pallies a taunt and Avenger's Shield was pretty good. I say that from a warrior perspective though, because I mained a warri tank from Vanilla to Legion, then quit retail. I remember a very important pala tank in the Hyjal raid. Damn waves.
---
Beacon of Light was an interesting addition as well.
---
Pally was always my favorite alt, so this time I changed things and main one for a different experience. The only dungeon I dps'ed so far was Razorfen Downs.
---
I feel this hat/staff combo became a standart when you want to make it obvious in your meme that is it a healer/caster
---
I don't see the hybrid hate here... even if there was, I have so much fun playing my shaman I don't care what people here think.
---
I ran uldaman three times this week from lvl 44 to 45. All three runs I did something different. First run I DPS, second I healed, third I rockbiter tanked.
---
The run I tanked took the shortest time. The run I DPS took the longest (final boss wiped like 10 times).
---
I'm stepping foot ZF and maurudon all weekend and at 47 now. Honestly in full scarlet gear I think I can fill any role as a filthy hybrid.
---
Hope you find party as dps. Must be hard for you to be accepted as dps.
---
sounds like biggie
---
I'm glad. Once it was established that it indeed was against the ToS (and thus, reportable), I have thrown out reports every single time a bored shadow priest has pain'd med in BB or Tanaris ;-)
---
Yeah.. until you get a shaman tank. You go girl
---
Nah that's not him, AU in his reddit name and australia related stuff in his history, definitely gonna be playing on oce realms.
---
If they need the healer spot and go 11/11 on Tuesday I doubt anyone would care if I pug on the weekend
---
SoC or SoR judgements dont "overwrite" your crusader judgement, since they only do damage and no debuff effect so there is no damage loss. you can (and should) judge crusader first on a mob and then continue using &amp; judging SoC or SoR. 
---
Then theres consecration, which you probably didnt spec into yet but is a must in every build, and quickly becomes a vital core part of your rotation (even against single targets in raids) as long as you can handle your mana. And at around lvl 44 or 46 you get Hammer of Wrath, the paladins "execute", a heavy hitting ranged finisher for targets &lt; 20%.
---
What most people just dont see or willfully ignore when it comes to playstyle and player activity is that not every used ability has to be a damaging attack. At endgame assuming no mana issues the basic ret rotation would be:
---
* Judgement + reapplying seal every 8s (15 APM)
---
* consecration every 8s (7.5 APM)
---
* hammer of wrath every 6s while enemy is &lt; 20% (\~2 APM)
---
\~24 APM before including any cooldowns, dispell spam or offheals. Compare this to f.e. a combat dagger rogue who does 10 backstabs in a minute (add slightly more APM for the initially full energy bar and for reapplying snd with the energy-restoring talent), or an enhancement shaman who does 10 shocks and 3 stormstrikes in a minute, and then ask yourself again: whos really the right-click-afk class?
---
Of course this is completely different when solo questing/levelling, as mana is a big issue there and the most efficient is to just auto attack with a seal and save your mana for heals between fights for no downtimes.
---
loudest and most seen
---
It's not about correct, you are slowing everyone down and taking their gear so you can play your silly "class fantasy." You can play a mage, or a warlock, you can play a warrior or a rogue, you can play a holy pally or a prot pally. Playing ret in a group setting is lame. Boomkin is even worse.
---
If a rogue wanted to stack spell cloth and go "poisons" or if a hunter wants to go "melee hunter" it's roughly as awful.
---
I've given you a threshold multiple times. BOE epics. Not sure how you missed that twice.
---
No, no-one cares because they know nobody's going to roll need to vendor, and everyone's going to get their fair share over the course of X runs. They *would* care if someone rolled need on everything. Stop twisting what I'm saying to fit your narrative.
---
Meh, it's about the journey not the end result. I have played on countless servers and spent literally thousands of hours grinding pvp ranks, raiding, messing around just to eventually quit because it got shut down or go to another one because we finished up all the content. I still don't think it was wasted time because I had a lot of fun and made a lot of new friends, plenty of which I am still in contact with almost 10 years later.
---
Look at the logs you buffoon.
---
As the other comment said, make sure the guild is fine with that, especially if you already looted a lot of gear from your runs. Especially if you plan to come back after casters got their mageblades, that could be viewed as very greedy.
---
link logs or ur a grey parsing virgin
---
Wow dude you sound like the GM of the guild I just left. Get help
---
shesmakween
---
You realize logs are public right? You guys are arguing about class performance and you literally don't know where to look for logs???? 
---
Classic.warcraftlogs.com
---
 fuck there's alot of noobs here
---
Help your guild
---
There is no proof that the warrior even set those rules. Which I highly doubt anyway. No one sets loot rules like that while leveling. 
---
All thos post shows is that the mage is a douche and a ninja. "I dont think you deserve it so no one gets it" with who would think this is a cool thing and I should totally tell reddit about it
---
I did. I also miss my uncle Charles, y’all.
---
Even improved vw still can't hold aggro against your dots. You can still go that build, but it means you have to slow down a lot. Most drain tank builds recommend imp or succubus. Whether they go into demo first or straight through affli depends a bit on personal preference, both are viable. It's better if you go demo for improved imp with using the imp, demo isn't a strong early if you're going succubus. Drain tanking also doesn't really work very well until the late 30s at the least.
---
That’s a good point i was thinking gdkp would be best because I could bankroll a big ticket item. That being said as a healer I probably have less gold to throw at an item than a mage. 
---
You’re right about not helping the guild I’d expect anyone who is benched to use their free lockout as they wish if we ask them to sit out
---
TF2 truly is a masterpiece.
---
pvp
---
Yea if you see a wild wolf fighting a DEMON, wouldn't you kill the demon and his master? Warlock class isn't  fit for RP with the story they set up
---
I did an estimate on the gold per hour with this method. Let me know your thoughts on this:  
---
Gold per hour estimation based on 15 min per run or 4 runs per hour.
---
Hydrospawn: vendor loot \~2g + essence of water 14% drop \~6g/run (25g/4) = 8g/run   
---
Zevrim: vendor loot \~1g = 1g/run
---
Mining:  
---
Average 3 veins per run &amp; 3 hits per vein, 3x3 = 9 hits per run  
---
9 thorium ore = 3.5g/run  
---
18 dense stone = 2g/run  
---
arcane crystal 3% droprate, 3x9 = 27% = 15g/run (60g/4)  
---
blue sapphire: 1% droprate, 1x9 = 9% = 5g/run (25g/10)
---
Combined = 29g/run or 116 gold per hour.
---
(not counting tomes because they are very rare and prices are declining)
---
&gt; the way things used to be. 
---
This is how it's always been. You might have had better experiences than other people, but to make up some fantasy world where everybody played nice and got along in 2004-6 is just insane. People see purple and they want it. Do I think it's an ideal system? No, but I'm not gonna be dumb enough to roll greed and simply hope everyone else is just as nice.
---
PVE players dont get it KEKW
---
Holy cow I didn't know people on the sub can't take jokes.
---
Difference is wether youre doing content just for the sake of doing content, but dont actually enjoy doing it so you tryhard af to do it as fast and brainless as possible, or if you actually just enjoy playing the game and have fun with what you do, even if it means not beating speedrecords.
---
That’s true lol I’ve been seeing a lot of mages in strat and scholo lately with Whitemanes chapeau
---
Idk why people do it. Waste days invested in a toon to troll a few people that literally has no repercussions except a gravewalk..
---
 Some dude tried to kill me from on top of the inn, I literally just walked 15 feet out of LOS and laughed at his dumb ass.
---

Use pet passive again and the pet will run back to where it was put on stay.
---
No they are not. Buddies and me camped horde every day for like 10 days. Nobody even got a warning.
---
Obv I wouldn’t be sittin my raids out if I’m needed but that’s a good point
---
&gt;It's fair if everyone can roll for it and sell it so they can actually get an item they need.
---
If it was a fair system don't you think guilds would be giving t1 BoE To anyone, so that they can sell it and buy their own piece of gear ?
---
It's fair if everyone can get an item for their class tu drop. Stop making pathetic ninja excuses.
---
&gt;It would have been ninjaing if you discussed about loot rules before and you decided that everyone rolls greed on epics and then one steals it by needing.
---
No that would have been a scam reprehensible by blizzard,  it's still a theft though. 
---
&gt;The game is fun when you play with others and set no unfair rules.
---
Unfair rules such as "don't be an asshole",  yeah fuck thoses rules right ?
---
Lol. Totaled it about 3 years ago. Got a Chevy Cruz now.
---
Holy fuck this post again
---
Twins in AQ would be interesting as well.
---
Imagine min maxing to try to clear molten core perfectly. Like this is real progression. Lmao
---
What class do mages find the hardest to kill in PVP?
---
Yeah I'm a boomkin, so what
---
&gt;I can see some argument that BoPs should only be needed to be worn, but really, they're going to be replaced and sold, so it's all just money in the end
---
I hope I'm misunderstanding you here and you are not saying that this experience will be used as a justification for you to Need every BoP that drops from here on out. 
---
Because that clearly is no solution to anything, it will just alienate you from group play in the end.
---
I'm having a grand time playing as any role as a druid, about to hit 40 real soon. Even as dps, the lack of output is often made up for multiple-fold from being able to help with critical heals when the healer's gone oom, or taking over tanking duties when the tank dies and things are spiralling out of control. 
---
And with the gnomish invisibility cloak, I can vanish with it and res the healer, so wipe protection. Woop woop.
---
another rusher bites the dust
---
Succubus charm is great CC. Sure you miss out on a bit of damage but in a pinch warlocks are fine CC bots.
---
Playing a resto shaman as well. Know the feeling... At least we are wanted in grps and raids
---
That's not a gold threshold, but ok. At least it's a starting point.
---
And just because you can't explain your stance clearly, doesn't mean I'm "twisting what you're saying". I actually don't have a narrative at all. I know when I roll Need/Greed, but you can't seem to articulate your point without being insulting.
---
I would say 0/31/20 allows you to raid effectively while also having most  but not all good pvp talents in survival tree.
---
As a rogue, the only thing things I dislike are:
---
Using health pot, but can be forgiven if both parties use them.
---
Humans who pop perception and just walk ontop of you before the duel even starts.
---
Those cancel each other, so you should be welcome.
---
This^
---
actually 10 silver for coarse is decent...on my server the AH maffia got it up to constant 25 per piece....

One post from 5 months ago, everything i wanted and more then what i was expecting.
---
Those fire packs are so easy I only put on 200fr gear to stand out  front and banish on pull /s.  This week was the first week (of 5 runs, 4 full clears) I didn't get radomly one shot by those dick heads.
---
69 copper.
---
Braaaaa. them peeps who tell people how to enjoy a game. they so wise
---
yeah but the difference between Dal'Rends and Krol+Mirah's is completely neligible compared to the amount of work required to get Dal'Rends MH. It's a complete waste of time and nerves and I would weep for anyone opting to farm Dal Rend when they already have Krol, especially as they're both easily replaced by raid swords.
---
Alterboy lol.
---
That's me when the tank gets one shotted and the rest of the group dies one by one as we try to flee.
---
Man that whole tram brawl was just...messy to watch and painful to experience. Was fun tho, look forward to phase 2 when honor drops.
---
&lt;STDs are BoP&gt;
---
I have not. Sorry to let you down 😥
---
Used to be 6 hours wheb I did that quest 14 years ago. Bwaaaah #feelOldNow
---
The winner always come out alive cause it's a duel not wpvp. Use your resources to fight the opposing faction
---
Never EVER had an issue with this, because I never abused this mechanic, and never needed to. Smooth sailing all the way to 60, I don't know what you are moaning about.
---
You only want a slow weapon because it correlates with high top end. You don't even really care about top end damage until lvl 40 anyway. It's better to have a 2.5 speed weapon with 80-100 dmg than a 3.6 with 70-90. It's better by a LOT. 
---
People often just talk about speed because when you compare similar weapons, slower is almost always higher top end.
---
It's an undead male... But yes.
---
This is bannable, report them.
---
I guess I should note that I never did find my way into Wintersprings using this method. I spent two hours navigating through the Skull mobs. Died 5 times. Ended up way north in the great sea, near north east corner of Winterspring. Killed my self hoping I would be ported into zone. I was ported to Westfall. I ended up just running through felwood. Only died once in the tunnel. My repair bill was 1 G. Could have just overpaid for the healing potion recipe on the AH. But I guess o got two FP’s out of it.
---
I’ve had the best wpvp experiences on a pvp server questing in STV
---
don't forget about the abuse you no doubt get for rolling on melee shit! Never sell ur self short!
---
Hell yeah! If you know of anything else I can do to improve my gaming let me know!
---
What’s the macro for this? I worry about wasting rage on heroic strikes. I guess I’d need a swing timer as well
---
Guilds set their own loot rules as I said. I bet some sell t1 pieces early on and some don't. Things not going your way doesn't make it ninjaing. It's the most fair if everyone can roll on items that sells a lot and that way exchange it to something they need if you're playing with strangers as far as I can think.
---
I don't know what makes you an asshole in this case if everyone had a fair roll. You didn't win so now everyone is an asshole, huh? Better check the mirror imo
---
Sorry you've been getting shitty replies. Ignore them.
---
Feral dps is fine, even at 60. And then you can also tank, which is very viable.
---
Leveling: Prowl and ravage, fairie fire, bleed, claw claw claw ferocious bite unless the mob has high health, in which case rip.
---
Dungeons: Ravage, then shred shred and then either rip or ferocious bite depending on health
---
Yes feral dps can't contest a good fury warrior or mage, but you'll do fine. Plus you bring a lot of utility (tanking or healing). Most people are always happy to bring a good feral along.
---
And the cycle continues
---
As others have said, its pretty common to happen. Was going through strath with my brother today who just hit 60, maiden's circle boe ring dropped off the archivist. 
---
Technically an upgrade for me as a warlock, best ring you can get outside of a raid, but alsp worth 300+ gold. If loot rules were need&gt;greed i would have been entitled to roll on that, but i would have gained a total of 5 spell power. I would much rather someone have a shot at a big payday than me gain 5sp i wont even notice.
---
My brother ended up winning the roll, sold it for 325g, bought his devilsaur set and had a little leftover for mount money.
---
Are you pretending to be an idiot or what? This guys is saying he does like 70% of other dps and we are calling bullshit on that paladins do 50% like your link proves.
---
Hmm, from what i know, you need follow to align characters, otherwise a small delay when turning characters can have each character turned a few degrees off, making it hard to have them grouped up.
---
You can still broadcast w a s d keys but just a tiny delay and you are off by a few degrees, that's why the use follow and have it bind to spammable key or W on main char.
---
What do you mean? Now the real game starts
---
Volatile power is BIS for locks until bloodvine, their crafted robe is rather poop. For mages it's the opposite, with crafted being best until p4.
---
Would it be worth it in a REALLY long run to level a mage alt to grind gold? I can already farm lashers with my paladin... Would ZF farming be much more efficient?
---
It's literally not war though. There is a real war going on against the other faction. You should use your resources there instead of in a practice duel
---
I got mine lvl 21, soloed SFK and BFD parts.
---
No, you're my hero.
---
My main was a resto shaman for about 10 years... it was so easy to find a group!
---
Have a tank or healer friend
---
Loudest and most seen for sure.
---
Content creators are usually min/maxers or People that Play hardcore. Other People try to orientate on that.
---
As you said. Everbody Plays the way they like and prefer. That is the great Thing about wow.
---
Take it casual if you like to. There is plenty likeminded People. They just don't talk about it as much :D
---
Have fun! That is the most important :) Find youself a nice guild that isn't too hardcore and has ncie People!
---
Ha ha thanks
---
The gates are open from the outside though
---
What is the opposing argument, then? If "roll Need on everything" is a poor solution, then what is a better one? Just telling him that he's wrong doesn't help without a better answer.
---
Play the game.
---
Go outside
---
Cheers for your insights. What pet would you realistically want once Drain tanking starts coming into play?
---
I can't disclose certain gaming secrets.
---
I like how \_Tharal\_ is looking at the scene dispassionately.
---
No addon needed, just type `/console SET chatClassColorOverride "0"` in chat.
---
Now go farm and amass gold so you don’t have to worry about it when phase 2 drops.
---
Grab consecration and add to it!
---
It was literally impossible to defend org due to the lag, once the alliance were in thralls room, the server basically stopped working, taking away the option for horde to intervene.
---
I wasn't aware there was a second raid on sylvannas much later that night.
---
Kinda salty how easy it is to get to the horde leaders where as storm wind and ironforge being connected you need twice as many horde.... And the servers make that impossible to bring enough people required.
---
Not a real answer but I was thinking the same thing but honestly I think I don't wanna be one of a bajillion aoe mages it's just so crazy. Mage was my fav class but it's so bad I'm boutta go to the dark side and make a lock lol
---
Aight imma head out
---
I'm not saying 350 is shit in general, but 350 is shit for a neckbeard that has full BiS already like u just said. The other full BiS guys pull like 500-600, that's a pretty huge gap
---
lmfao
---
I think it's atlas loot but I'm not sure. It started showing up on my tooltips as well after I updated addons a couple weeks ago and I don't have any BiS trackers or anything.
---
&gt;If it was a fair system don't you think guilds would be giving t1 BoE To anyone, so that they can sell it and buy their own piece of gear ?
---
A lot of guilds do sell the T1 BoEs, yeah. Most guilds sell the ingots from golemagg, too. They usually don't just give it to a roll, they use the gold to improve the guild.
---
To play devil's advocate: Nobody can agree on what "being an asshole" actually is.
---
To me, that's why this discussion is so interesting.
---
There will be shorter Queue times on alliance I think.
---
Since BG's will be crossrealm and alliance is usually less played on PVP Server (AFAIK) it will probably be alliance with shorter Queues.
---
Nontheless it probably won't be much longer for Horde either.
---
I mean, its all down to time. Mage doesn't create gold out of thin air, you will need to take a lot of time to level it and also to do the actual farm so if you can / want to invest the time, go for it, otherwise its probably a massive waste of time.
---
At 90 percentile (meaning CDs popped, some world buffs, etc) paladins are doing 266.22 dps on average while warlocks, in the middle of the pack, are doing 359.39. Warriors popping 30 minute cds are always going to be an outlier. 266/359 is approximately 0.74. Who's pretending to be an idiot?
---
But EPL is full of UD, why do the strath UD need containment? Or is it from before in warcraft 3?
---
really? Seen a lot lot of locks hunting for the pattern. Good to know.
---
Irony is SW and irongforge are even worse.
---
180 dps is absolute dog shit my guy, idk what to tell you. Youre playing with bad players
---
I made the switch around 55-56 and started running brd a lot and took breaks to do some questing with my buddy who is a mage. You will level up pretty quickly running dungeons as long as you grab the quests beforehand. 
---
I was reluctant to make the switch as well, but as you will soon find out, there's always a need for prot tanks. You will have no problems finding a group. Strat and scholo are 58-60. I can honestly say that I hated strat the most.
---
It's useful for BoP items. I wish they had a need/pass system for BoEs, though. It'd make it a lot easier to handle, and noobs wouldn't cry about losing a 150g roll every day. Imagine crying about a 150g drop. Just buy it.
---
Yep
---
This is correct, idk why you’re getting downvoted. When I was power leveling my mage in RFC with my 60 lock, he got ~20 xp per kill while they were grouped and my lock murdered things. Adding a few random low level people to my runs actually increased the xp per kill my mage received.
---
Reminds me of the time I was in Tokyo and there was a 7-11 across the street from another 7-11
---
Nope, I can out DPS a full BiS ret pally even if I go BM in greens. Keep getting offended because you're a douche bag dragging your groups down
---
Isn't he human?
---
I can only recommend to ignore all the „BiS“ and „this is how to play“ or „I did 150 runs for this and that“ posts. I’m almost level 57 and I do whatever I want. The good part about classic is, that you gonna progress regardless of what you doing. Even the grind to your Epic Mount. You should invest as much time as you want, because at the end of the day it’s just a game. What should you have while playing a game? Fun. Where’s the time for fun if you are always stressing about items and gear. It’s a great side factor of the game but really you should just play however you want and do whatever is fun for you.
---
Finally a test of the unstoppable luck verse the immovable unfortunate
---
Developers didn’t like hybrids in Vanilla and gimped them.  What do you expect?
---
Sure is
---
Yup, pretty much.
---
I tried deleting all my alts once I chose one to stick with. That helps since the temptation to go back is gone.
---
If you're a meta slave to a 15 year old game all I can do is shake my head and hope you eventually come to your senses.
---
Barrens. There are few zones in the game that involve such a large level variety. Outside of major cities and zones containing raids Barrens generally has the largest population. So many people to communicate with and so much support when needed. Really a staple in the Classic community.
---
Your fun doesn't matter in the serious world of Warcraft! 
---
Peak numbers! Be like machines for my enjoyment! No deviants! Obey! OBEY!
---
Yeah...
---
This guy gets it!
---
I always do it like that. Gotta save those 10 second
---
It's not a gold threshold. If you sell a BoE, you don't remove it from the game, you just give it to another player who will use it. No one is deleting the epic BoEs, they're just trading it to someone who will pay for it.
---
Depends how crossrealm works. If you have a battlegroup with only pvp realms the horde queue time will be high (consider some servers got 80/20 ratio)
---
Yeah I get that, my example was a little tongue in cheek.
---
Yep, basically. 
---
There are exceptions but they are not common.
---
If you don't think that I interpreted your argument correctly, then correct it. I said "so what you're saying" so that I can restate your argument in my own words, and we could get on the same page. Your attempt to discredit my character instead of my argument is actually a pretty poor attempt at subversion yourself.
---
For what it's worth, I don't agree with the other person's rules either, but it's a much better starting point than you gave, which is incredibly loose.
---
yup my group started on bigglesworth and then transferred to anathema as well.  its much closer the the vanilla experience i remember.   those high pop servers are just ridiculous and not a representation of what the game was like 15 years ago.  if you prefer it that way good for you but i am so glad my group transferred. my enjoyment of classic went up quite a bit when we did that.
---
Yeah congrats, they just suck dick instead of massive dick when you look at the stats super favorably.
---
What I've seen people writing is that this can't be done with the APIs Blizzard provides. The problem is not to display the healing numbers but to display the in the 3D space so you can't show them over somebodies head but you could show them over unit frames or somewhere else.
---
Holy crap there's lots of BSB folks here.  Also yes! Very good to see you Dartlic!  Thanks for not instituting a 'No riding on the bowsprit' policy, because jumping off of it onto Theramore dock is the only acceptable way to disembark.
---
I never understood these people to be honest. I am not 60 yet (only 42) but even if I was at 60 already I could come up with so many things to do daily or just randomly. It's what Classic is about, nothing tells you what to do, you can plan whatever you want and this is why it's not getting boring for me.
---
Night Reaver is BiS for 2h warris. Especially for the proc, paired with crusader.
---
 Meet up with your favorite warrior and do jump runs

I got a boe epic out of one, but that was in tbc :p
---
Feel free to give it a taste
---
At the start of TBC heroics were very tough, once people were geared you could just power through them. It would have been good if they'd introduced T2 heroics to TBC &amp; WotLK
---
And frankly, heroics in classic would be great.
---
So I just hit level 50 on my Shaman (enh spec with 10 pts in resto). I'm not particularly familiar with dungeons in this tier. I've run Maraudon a couple times. I think I'm almost the right level for sunken temple.
---
I always see talk about other instances: UBRS, LBRS, BRD; can someone give me a brief description of the remaining dungeons from level 50-60? Like I said I have very little experience at this level bracket but dungeons are my favorite and I'd like to run them all if possible. Thank you!
---
You sure this is what a screenshot is? 🤔
---
Hey, that'e exactly what I did. If you want to go leveling in Western/Eastern Plaguelands then I do not recommend, because killing things solo is reeeaaally slow. But other than that, being prot is really helpful for dungeons because it's like tanking up 2 levels. Improved shield block, concussion blow, and improved bloodrage are huge upgrades, but you do start to miss improved overpower and mortal strike.
---
? It's true, I don't say it to the ret pallies/boomkins, but it is true, you're being selfish and lame when you play them.
---
Like a hunter rolling on dal rends, or shadow priest taking healer gear. 
---
It's selfish. That's just a fact. Do what you want but you are being selfish.
---
Cool thank you !
---
Name creativity level  - Expert.
---
After getting killed like 4 times by bored lvl 60s in the space of 15 minutes, getting nuked by that demon was the final straw and I abandoned the idea of questing in Burning Steppes.
---
Hehe, I feel you.
---
I also got a message from a guildie that I had C.O.D-ed him an arcanite bar for 60 silver (instead of 60 gold). He knows that I'm a valuable ally so he only called me a dumdum and sent the rest of the gold too! 
---
Then he specced from enhance to elemental and stopped buying them &gt;.&lt; oh well!
---
Unlikely. My very first server was a PvE server during Vanilla. PVP was virtually none existent. Got so board of the lack of PVP content that I rerolled onto a PVP server and have never looked back. It's each to their own but I found PvE servers lacking in a core part of the game.

There was a rumor going around Tuesday that the last boss of DM north had been hotfixed, and isn't soloable anymore by hunters.  Since then, I haven't seen any news on it.  The most recent youtube video I see with a "runthrough" was from Monday 21 Oct, prior to the alleged patch.  Can anyone confirm/deny if it is still possible or not?
---
As a healer, I have a much easier time finding groups rolling in my dps ret set.
---
It works in landing you on /ignore
---
*backstab*
---
Are.. are you..........  
---
Are you eating his a##?
---
It's a pure measurement of performance. He made no statement as to whether it's fun or not to play, stop mixing those two things up and you'll get way less triggered.
---
I love male trolls in any cloth armor.
---
Especially Tier X priests.
---
1: Their legs make it look like some big curtains.
---
2: Their posture and appearance in contrast to the armor just screams "Dum Dum Troll now is Pope. What troll do now? Ugggghhhhh....."
---
You might be using them a long time, been clearing mc/ony on CD since week two and still no raid weapons, we've seen one viskag,0 brut blades and 0 perds
---
What I am trying to say is that if this experience causes him to roll Need on every blue BoP drop from every boss in every dungeon, he will have a miserable time because no one will group with him after a while. It is a poor solution because people are running dungeons for quests, a (hopefully) good time and first and foremost; upgrades. If some person goes on a rampage and blindly Needs every BoP blue item that the other group members joined the dungeon for, what do you think will be consequence after this happening enough times? Kicks, naming and shaming and a destroyed server rep with the end result that the eternal Need-roller will have a hard time rolling Need, since he doesn't get any dungeon invites. 
---
Do you not agree with that? Did you misunderstand what I wrote, or are you simply on some crusade and here to challenge every comment in this? I think my above comment was both rational and sound, and far from offensive to the OP. I left another comment further up where I tell OP I understand their pain and that this probably isn't how the system should work in cases like these, but that it sadly is more or less the way it is. I don't fully agree with it, but accept it for what it is.
---
My solution is to not start rolling need on everything because you lost a BoE epic, but instead try to go on with the game and have a good time and play as normal. Perhaps make a macro to press at the start of a dungeon with your (personal) proposal on how to handle different BoE drops (I don't do this myself, so won't go into any speculative details on such rules of handling rolls).
---
"Another example of what kind of ppl the mage class appeals to and how hunters are fine now that the class is freed from such players"
---
... is how I'd fix the title
---
U literally just agreed it's selfish to play a ret pally, and then continued to defend it. What? It's like you guys assume everyone here is a try hard -- I'm not even close. I get on for 2 hours a night and I stretch it for raid nights. I'm mayyyybe half pre raid BiS, haven't gotten a raid piece yet. That being said, I've never seen a ret pally that wasn't last on the list except an almost FULL BiS pally, who did like 350 DPS. Come on now...
---
Despawns fast, eat ass
---
This is an interesting aspect to it also, but I think ultimately unimportant. When you vendor an item, you are creating the gold from the game and not taking it from another player. So either you create for yourself that you will then give to another player when you buy something, or you take gold from someone else and give them the item.
---
The altruism is a nice-sounding argument, but I don't agree that it is the deciding factor here.
---
Lol... Let me know what your character name and server is so I can look up your logs and laugh at how bad you are
---
Yes. It was taken from my stream and cropped for a side by side.
---
I often play on the train on my work commute. My ping starts around 30ms in Amsterdam, screams up to 4000ms when the train hits Bijlmer Arena (seems to be a cell black hole there), I usually have to log out/log in again after the train leaves the station again, then it stutters around the 50ms most of the rest of the way home through the countryside.
---
WTF Bijlmer Arena
---
Hmm, I did not really listen to music at that time, nor now even, like, very rarely!
---
I really like the Alizee song - J'en ai marre, especially since I've moved to France 2 years ago.
---
As additional info, part of the night elf female dance is based on this song!
---
missed vellaris tho
---
twice.
---
Bear swipe.
---
Bear taunt.
---
Bear Faerie fire
---
That first issue seems a little odd to me. Are you logging out properly?
---
I’ve bound my mousewheel up, down and click to some of the side bars and you could do this for forms. I use my 5th mouse button for cat form and stealth. Hopefully someone else can help you more with the mousewheel macros.
---
My Druid is only sitting at 22 at the moment but that’s enough to give you examples of macros I’ve made. I don’t personally use mouse wheel but I’ve macroed a few buttons so the spells change when I shift form. E.g. my F key does moonfire, swipe and claw depending on the form. Hopefully these are of use to you. Drop me a PM and I will post some on here when I get home from work.
---
Well it's second best after volatile power currently, and pretty decent for PVP I think. Also relatively cheap to craft if you can be arsed to farm the runes.
---
The Night Reaver proc is insane. It's pretty hard to compete with that. It's also not too expensive, I got mine for 15g a couple days ago.
---
Nvm then \^\^
---
MS&gt;OS while leveling is a very, VERY weird rule to set. Everyone is dps specced. It might make sense if you don't want the healer to roll on caster items (except priests), but that's it.
---
It entirely depends on the community you're with. In my guild, were not pressuring for progress and would be happy to let a pally tank raids, because it's about having fun, not min/maxing. Then there's the min/maxing folks that will shun you for being any kind of spec other than top tier.
---
There arent any.
---
If you win and they cry just reply "scoreboard" and now youve won twice.
---
I use beast lore on druids in animal form! (yes, I'm a hunter)
---
2Nice
---
Yup, you can do 5 mans with basically any group setup, just a matter of how efficient it's going to be.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-dungeons-overview
---
Crazy... Try /world maybe your Server is using that a bit more.
---
Sucks - maybe you Need to make your own Group looking for tanks &amp; healers. That way you can make sure to take a Rouge and a hunter as DPS :D So you get your items when they drop ;)
---
How much gold do you make per hour?
---
Yea, it's "enough" but it's much faster to stop and get yourself blue major upgrades from dungeons, after all you're still grinding mobs the whole time you're inside.  Trust me, I've tried it both ways.  Also it only took me 6.5 days to hit 60 doing it my way.
---
Not the point, gotta work on that reading comprehension bud.
---
A well played ret should be in the middle of the pack in a normal guild. So he is slacking
---
Weird, I tried and it didn't work :(
---
Try underclocking, this might solve your heat prob. Some cards are overclocked from the start. Tweaking their freq/volts might help.
---
Can’t be real, the Mage would charge you for pressing the buff button
---
&gt; If your pet attacks it resets.
---
Just dismiss it. Unsure how this one can be a complaint.
---
This guy beats rogues.
---
Nice+Nice
---
I didn't correct it because I assumed you were intentionally misrepresenting me, considering in the same breath you also claimed "you haven't given me a threshold", which is a straight lie. You can try and dance around and pin this on me all you like, but you're the one twisting things around in a misguided attempt to make my position look weak.
---
It's not loose. It's set in stone. **BOE EPICS**. You just continually ignore it. Stop replying to me.
---
That's just like a quest dude lol, get rep, do a quest, clicky clicky.
---
Right, because playing a spec that does 1/2 or a 1/3rd of the DPS as others isn't being selfish.
---
 Druids can tank on the fly. They can heal at crunch times. Had a feral druid pop out and heal on Rag and saved the raid. Ele shams can pop out and heal when shit goes bad. Shadow priests can pop out and heal, they also bring shadow weaving. What the hell does a ret pally bring? 
---
You already have the buffs from the holy pallies. You bring absolutely nothing, *annnnnd* shit DPS. That's selfish. That's fine that you want to play that way, I'm not knocking it, but it's pretty cut and dry here -- its selfish.
---
Yeh I am definitely not a hardcore raider/minmaxer but I also would feel bad gimping my party/guild progress if we're doing dungeon runs!  The things I've read (mostly here and on icyveins) is that Pally tanking wouldn't even physically be able to do raids ? Is it just that a warrior/druid tanks is so much better?
---
This is why I play Classic.
---
I’d never use a gaming laptop again desktop all the way for me personally
---
I cant say for other hybdrids, but playing a shadowpriest is extremly depressing in PVE, you basicly have no upgrade to get in MC, you have to pass on your full tier set and those random epics that happen to be upgrades over your dungeons BIS are contested by every single caster in the raid. Anathema? Sure, after all the healers have their benediction. Just my 0.02 about playing a hybrid :D Dps and viability is totally fine tho.
---
My core hound tooth says otherwise.
---
Are you really making 160g/h?
---
I guess if you control the market, maybe.
---
Else, if others get hold of these, the prices should drop imo.
---
How convenient! I'm just about to hit 55 too &lt;3.
---
rip video card.  laptop?  enjoy sending that shit in to my job (i work at a del lrepair center) if you're lucky youll get your laptop back in 3-6 weeks.
---
That's amazing dude! It looks so much fun to play
---
On alliance side I don't have to deal with that, but nameplates threw me off guard a few times.
---
mages are usually in high demand so it's not your class that's holding you back
---
Targets health I believe
---
The main thing you want to check with dungeons are the levels for the bosses. Anything &gt;3 levels higher than you is going to resist your spells a lot, be hard to hit and hit you for a lot.
---
At 50 I'd say:  
---
-  You're at the edge of the ZF level range. Running ZF and clearing everything is good exp up to level 52 or so
---
- You can definitely do Maraudon. There's some nice mail gear, the princess ring, a great Shammy shield and a nice 2h Axe in there.
---
- ST, maybe with some other higher levels in there with you, easier to start ST at 52. I think the last boss is 55 and has a sleep mechanic. If he sleeps the tank and attacks you, you might die real fast.
---
I think it's very interesting that you think if I didn't misunderstand you then I must be "on a crusade".
---
Obviously if OP is coming at this from the mindset that upgrade = Need, then just telling him not to roll Need is unhelpful.
---
My personal stance is that if you want it for gold, you push the button that is a gold coin, and if you need the upgrade, then you push Need. But I understand that this is not how most people operate, and so I am very interested to probe the reasoning behind the arguments to see if my stance holds water or the others do.
---
Bear can tank all dungeons, MC, Ony and most of BWL even as maintank. You are perfectly fine as offtank in raids. In Pre-Bis Bears are arguably better then warriors. Youll generate way more threat. So yeah, go for it. With HotW/NS you can tank and heal with the same spec and 2 Equip-Sets.
---
Also, they can run out of mana.
---
horde pleb
---
I wish my overpower wouldn't ever miss.
---
Had to downvote to keep at 69. Hope you understand.
---
Someone will answer more in-depth but: it ain't bad at all. All preraid stuff can be very comfortably done by a bear tank and all raid stuff except some two bosses can be done as well, maybe not as comfortable.
---
Look up skarmtank on YouTube for a guy who knows a lot about bear tank and warrior tank and makes good comparisons. And do yourself a favor and look up the 0/30/21 build for a lot of role flexibility and plenty tankability
---
Thanks, glad you enjoyed it! It sure is fun :)
---
you can kill him solo, takes like 20 minutes
---
just clear the 2 ads group around the rim and kite him
---
burst at 40%, pretty easy
---
Thank you :) Happy to hear you enjoyed it
---
Good thing your gonna get that rank 10 dueling set and maybe next week if you win enough duels get the grandmasters dueling weapons. 
---
Oh wait there is no reward so you spent gold trying to prove to someone that your a big strong pvp guy 
---
If you want to practice full kit fights go start some world pvp where there are actual rewards and consequences
---
If I got killed by someones "main" after griefing them id be so happy to spend the rest of the day just ruining their play time when they switch back to their alt and just baiting them to waste all their time switching toons
---
There are some bosses in BRD that rogues can solo but they require a lot of setup.
---
However there are stealth runs . 
---
3 rogues can stealth to angerforge and burn him down.
---
Equally a stealthed rogue and stealthed druid can take him.
---
This is at 60btw
---
As a shadow priest when should I use shadow form in pvp? If I constantly switch in and out of it it drains my mana. Obviously I open in it, but once I leave it because someone needs heal then I feel that its not worth it to reactivate.
---
TBC is when all specs become kinda viable.
---
They're obviously looking for CFH in Strat!
---
At no point in TBC was CC required in Dungeons or Heroic Dungeons. You may have had a boss or single pull which were very much easier with CC, but it wasn't mandatory. Again; you would know if you had played on a server, since BC hasn't been out for so long. My memory is fresh on this, clearly yours isn't.
---
Glad to have been of help!
---
That’s some BfA Sylvanas level shit right there!
---
Granted! Your healing spells now have a chance to be resisted
---
This is from Blizzard's Old World Dungeons web page:  
---
\&gt; Now, these former champions of humanity stand resurrected, bolstering the Scourge further. If they are not sealed in their lair, the forces of undeath, led by the death knight Lord Aurius Rivendare and the dreadlord Balnazzar, will soon boil forth to ravage Lordaeron once again.  
---
So im guessing it would be even worse in EPL if the gates were not shut.
---
I have some stance macros where I start out with a question mark as well. Most likely there’s a command in the macro that doesn’t load correct. They work despite an error message, I’ll see if I can post an example later.
---
Dank is good now?
---
Oh it's not a complaint, it's just to confirm that your pet cannot help regardless. A lot of people I've spoken with assume it's easy with pet without knowing you can't use them!
---
looks great, congratz!
---
The entire thing from Sulfuras craft in IF to everyone returning to IF after UC and TB was less than two hours.
---
There was a horde counter raid on SW that didn't get past the gates much later tho
---
Lag was just as bad for Alliance btw
---
My guess would be that this is for gameplay purposes.
---
Garrosh is 5???
---
What is there to "pin on" you? I am asking for your reasoning to things, but your only real response so far is the equivalent of "NO U".
---
I wish you the best, and hope that you get out of whatever dark place you're in.
---
 Can confirm. Will also charge you for water and only give you half a stack
---
You can also just jump straight into the lava from the upper rim. Swim a little bit in the lava and there's an entrance in the lava underneath the window. People rarely see you drop down and even if they do, they probably won't have LoS.
---
Ungoro is easy, but the Silithus one would either require over powered gear or shadow prot potions. He does around 700 damage per cast, and casts that spell every few seconds. He averages out about 4-5k shadow damage, and thats not counting any melee damage he causes when he breaks out of root.
---
My favourite place in Classic World of Warcraft is the Un'Goro Crater. When you start arriving at the zone you immediately get hit with so many different impulses:
---
The sorroundings are thick plants, there are big raptors and even bigger Devilsaurs. While you are being chased you see glowing crystals, plant pedals and earth waiting to be collected.
---
And it also means you are approaching endgame and finishing your leveling journey soon :)
---

try to find a group where nothing is locked as a rogue, ret paladins have it easy
---
warriors, rets, enhancers, hunters, other rogues all wanting our stuff
---
For PVP is it even worth using tier1/2 set items over the blue honor gear (head, gloves, pants, boots for the extra blink cooldown)?
---
Ohh no - I don't think they had the tech to determine that at the time the game was made, or maybe they intentionally left it for hunters only!

Great, a few more answers like these and I ll make a google spreadshit. I think the comunity would greatly benefit it

Kid...
---
As one of the main healers you’re right it’s unlikely I would be asked to sit out a raid and it isn’t a good look to volunteer. One of the reasons I was looking for insight in a more anonymous manor. 
---
Thank you for your input. 
---
If the guild has cleared all the content 11/11 on the first day of reset what else would I need to be unlocked for? I don’t believe my guild has enough members to field a second raid team although that may be on the schedule in the coming weeks, or atleast hosting a pug of some kind for members who are recently 60. This is my first classic experience so I don’t know much about the evolution of a growing guild
---
Either roll an Alt or do something else with your life. It's not that hard.
---
If you wanna rp this properly. Everyone just pretend that they can't go through the bears and then react just as if you physically couldn't. Trying to ask the bears nicely, then get angry and threaten them. Then start talking about getting cranes in there to move them etc.  Fun for hours
---
At Level 30 I'm not sure. By the time you are 35-38 you can go Scarlet Monestary Graveyard. There is some rares there which you can farm. Get some nice Drops, open chests, make Gold by pickpocketing etc.
---
If you want to do one with other People I advise looking for People in your Servers Chat channels.
---
Just /join lfg   -   /join world  or use /LookingForGroup to search for Groups to do dungeons with
---
Boat guy!
---
I love this man.
---
i'm a rogue
---
Cool guys don't look at explosions.
---
Why would you stun grenade on consecrate, it would break immediately.
---
&gt; Again; you would know if you had played on a server, since BC hasn't been out for so long.
---
what are you on about? TBC was more than a decade ago. I played it.
---
Non-heroics didn't need CC, but heroics were tough for a while until people got geared, then they were easy. 
---
By your metric of "very much easier with CC" there has never been any content in the game where CC was mandatory. Every fight could always be powered through at some point without using CC. It's a silly metric.
---
Did you coincide this with levelling to 60 or farmed rep post 60? My understanding is you get extra rep when the quests are level appropriate?
---
Healcomm
---
You look like the guy from rundfunk(dutch show)
---
Your time and ability to play yhe game how you choose to play it is not &gt; anothers because of your class/spec. If you dont understand that, youre just a selfish player. Hybrids are in the game and are free to play the game how they want to play it. Classic is going to die real fast if pricks like you bully hybrids back to retail. You need their classes to progress. If they wanna roll for DPS loot, let them.
---
Personally I think that hybrid Specs should be doing less damage/healing/tanking than their solo spec counterpart. Their strength lies in their flexibility in role and I can rely on them to switch to Healing or DPS if needed. It makes them really valuable members of my raid especially when I don't have the luxury of having 40 optimal members who show up week to week.
---
As a Shadow Priest you're better off just focusing on yourself by staying in Shadowform and doing as much damage as possible.
---
Dank has always been good, grandpa.
---
holy shit is that... THE sex number??!!!!!!!!!!!!!! omfg nice amirite?!!
---
You get an awesome sword from a wailing caverns quest. This lastet me to level 30 and I'm still top-dps in Dungeon groups. Wingblade ist the name if I remember correctly.
---
I think there's a few armor pieces with stealth detection. I'll return later after I do some searching.
---
I wish others would buff me as they run by
---
Thrall very thicc and juicy
---
Oh my? Is that your sex doll? Is she anatomically correct?
---
Are you pre-casting and cancel-casting?
---
Thought that marks main tank
---
Uncanny.
---
You still get crit while sitting, but it doesn't count towards procs like reckoning. However, if you stand up at the right moment, it should still work afaik, the timing is rather tricky though.
---
god I hate tanks
---
Yea exactly it's simplest thing and the taste you have when you actually eat is something you never experience otherwise. I usually eat 2 times a day and my window is from about 5 to 7 hours
---
But rogue class color is yellow and Druid is orange.
---
You can tank endgame dungeons in a raid healing spec 30/21/0 is great for this with some tanking gear
---
Breaks spells and attacks  for 1 second between damage ticks on non targeted mobs. Nice in solo and a massive help in dungeons especially when there are healers. 
---
Also the mid range stun grenades make 2-4 per craft and have been the best bang for my buck at the moment
---
Because some people (or a lot of people) use it like a noob doesn't mean it's inherently noobish
---
fear has saved many wipes (even if bad use of it causes some)
---
Depends on class and slot. I know warlock T1 especially isn't all that amazing in PvE because it lacks spellpower, but tons of stamina and set bonuses make it really good in PvP. On the other hand, you will also be wearing some of that blue PvP items even in raids.
---
Curious if you take that build for an all-round build (PvP/goldf/ raid), even though you get some hit%, if its Not worth putting some Points in the elemental precision
---
It would be "shaman" to see him go to waste 
---
Right ? Right?
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?item=3822](https://classicdb.ch/?item=3822)  is a cheap Horde alternative but NR is better.
---
To be honest, up until MC they're not that far behind. A serious ret can be competitive this phase. Once BWL comes out though, that's another story
---
A lot of the lists online for prebis are also just wrong. Spriest prebis helmet is felcloth hood, when crimson felt hat is very clearly better. Other than world drops, neither class needs a low drop rate item. And if you aren’t getting lucky you can always farm felcloth and craft your own gear since +shadow dmg is really all you’re looking for.
---
Imagine thinking its a good taunt
---
I just tanked deadmines and I’ve literally only ever healed before. The PUG knew I had never done it, didn’t care, and I just went bear and tried to do what I always saw my friends I usually play with do. We survived except once when someone else pulled Enemies by accident .. but man I had no idea what I was doing and it was fun. Like really fun. I was probably too cautious cause I’m used to being in the back, but the group was so helpful and had no problem helping. I really like that I can pretty much do either in a pinch. Maybe it’s not perfect but people have to learn somehow.
---
Hey man, mutltiboxers are scum, it's just the way it is. People view you as lower than a 60 ganking lowbies.
---
We have at least 12 active druids in our guild.
---
It depends which pieces. The 3 piece T1 is a good SP boost. Again relevant to which pieces you have.
---
I watched a Paladin MT Onyxia 🤷‍♂️ who gives a fuck? Just play the game and stop policing how other people play.
---
To be fair, mages have to re-sheep from time to time
---
&gt; you may apply at Blizzard and change this for the better.
---
&gt;stop pretending you know shit. Cause you don't. Kid...
---
The irony here is hilariously. That's a fat yikes my dude.
---
A lot of deciding about professions depends on what you want to do and what support you have.  While it seems really cool as a new player to be able to make things, money is super tight until you learn the ropes and you'll find that when you level up you even need to prioritize which skills to buy.  As a result, a lot of people find it easier to take gathering professions to supplement income early and then take the crafting professions later when money is less of an issue.  
---
Engineering, while \_great\_ for pvp (it adds a lot of utility as well as explosives), is one of the most expensive professions to level up.  If you have some source of income that makes this a non-issue, go for it, but otherwise, be warned b/c it may not be able to pay off for quite some time.  
---
Tailoring/Enchanting are 2 professions that don't rely on gathering professions.  You will get cloth from humanoids you kill, and you can use that to skill tailoring, and you can disenchant tailoring items you don't want and use that to skill enchanting.  Enchanting is a tough road, especially past 200, but there is payoff along the way as you'll be able to make the gear you're wearing better with it, and tailoring can provide you some nice upgrades as you level.
---
Alchemy/Herbalism is another solid choice and is useful for pvp.  You could spend money buying potions that you'll use in pvp, or you can just keep these two professions and skill them up.  Make and keep the potions you need for pvp (swiftness, free action, cleansing, etc.) and sell what you don't need either in potion or herb form.
---
U got some math to back that statement up?
---
God I miss elitistjerks
---
As many have reported already the issue is likely your graphics card dieing. 
---
I don't know why everyone in here is talking about overheating causing this, it's just false 99.9 percent of the time if you have a graphics card made in the last 5 years or so. 
---
Graphics cards have heat limits set by the manufacturer that will not allow the card to go past certain temperatures. If your card reaches this heat limit the card will throttle itself and reduce the clock speed / power to force the card to cool down. 
---
Not sure what your build looks like but alot of modern CPUs have onboard built in graphics that will work in a pinch for testing. Unplug your monitor from your gpu and disconnect the power on your GPU. Plug into the on board graphics on your motherboard and test wow again. It will probably be very laggy, but if you don't get artifacting the likely source of your issues is a busted GPU.
---
Contact your manufacturer, most of them will fix your it if the card is less than 2 years old.
---
They had to because of the mindset that is currently plaguing classic. People werent rolling the healing classes because they were being 100% pigeonholed into one playstyle when the classes were supposed to be able to perform at least 2 roles
---
I couldn’t help but reading this and going “pew pew, pew pew” in my head.
---
At 350agi you would get 52.5 extra agi from 5/5 Lightning reflexes. This ammount of extra agi gives 105AP which would be greater than the 100AP would get from trueshot aura. However it is much more complicated then that. The 52.5 extra agi also gives you about 1% crit  but MM effects other people and your own pet. Taking lightning reflexes gives you 3% crit from an earlier talent but losses you 15% dmg to multishot and 5% dmg bonus to ranged attacks.
---
Its not that simple.
---
No judgement here but if you’re that bored why don’t you shut the computer off for a bit and do something else? I’m sure we could all use some fresh air these days ha
---
I low key just ignore every mage that whispers or is looking for a group when I'm forming dungeons. I'm hardly unique in this as a few other people I've played with also refuse to play with mages for 5 man content.
---
How many times is this meme going to get posted?
---
Hybrids arent the problem. Ret pallies are. Hybrids bring other things to the raid, ret pallies don't.
---
Luna Unit Frames have a healing add-on baked in that will track the whole raid's healing and let you know who's healing who.
---
They dropped to 1.9 g on mine...
---
I consider Ravage optional - it takes too much time to prowl for a chance at a juicy crit. I do it occasionally, but I don't claim to be a druid expert. If the spreadsheets say it's the best, then I need to just step up.
---
Some classes have more interactions. Warriors need to stance dance and make use of procs
---
Well so buy your water at ah then.
---
If some rando in orgri asks me for 6 stacks of water. Yeah I'm going to ask a fucking fee.
---
It's still cheaper for them than buying at ah or  people get very offended tho when I ask for a fee for water.
---
Portals on the other rhqnd people. Gladly pay 1g for.
---
Whatsup with the double standard?
---
This 100%, play what you want if your guild allows it but it’s dumb to argue that Rets aren’t shit
---
Is it racist to paint chef BRD in dark iron face? Probably not, you have my upvote
---
Yeah, sort of. On my defense I'd say we didn't attack the paladin in other opportunities, we only engaged in combat when we were on the same quest as him.
---
Don't kid yourself, alliance also attacks in packs. It's not faction related. :DDD
---
It’s a good choice for the meme but it always worries me when I see mages show up with it I assume they’re just gonna aoe every pull which they usually do
---
I agree with this. If you have a good run tell the group at the end it was a good run and if they ever need you to give you a /w or to add you.  or at least /w the tank/healer saying so
---
Also do whatever you can to benefit the group - like Give free water, buff everyone etc. 
---
I also save any shiny fish scales to give to shaman, meat to give to hunter pets, and offer out 1 or 2 buff food to each party member per run. If I don’t have much I prioritise the tank. If you loot a health potion - give it to the tank. Mana potion? Give to healer.
---
&gt; And then you can also tank, which is very viable.
---
Or you can be the only druid healer in an entire raid, which means you'll get geared faster than the 10 mages :)
---
People keep clearing out the AH of essences, and they're ridiculously priced because of it. Only fire is reasonable, sitting at 4-6g. The rest are near 20 a piece.
---
Sooo it was down to farming for me. I'm 7 earth and 5 air short of the robes. :D
---
You are aware that the information for TBC is far better than what they had to work with for Vanilla non-official servers? The Vanilla servers that were run were almost identical with Classic servers in terms of tuning, unless they specifically decided to overtune it, so every TBC server out there is very, very close to the actual TBC tuning. You might not know that or understand that, since you're willfully being ignorant, but that's how it is.
---
&gt; Yes, that is exactly what I'm doing
---
And I'm telling you, both from first hand experience and non-official servers, that it wasn't. If you had CC, you used it to make it much easier, but it wasn't at any point mandatory to do Heroic Dungeons in TBC, unless you were a very bad player.
---
The reason i opted for female NE hunter back then. I had images from WC3 NEs (mostly Malfurion and other druids) in my head and they all looked bulky and badass. Then i saw the WoW models and had to nope out.
---
If you were merely 'geared enough' to do heroics you just wouldn't get invited to certain runs unless you set it up with your own guild and they were okay with dragging you through.
---
I played Enh all the way up to Muru.  Still couldn't get invites to shattered halls.
---
Kang the decapitator was going for 30g on my server the other day! Get that!!
---
You are right. In addition it passively makes your regular stealth a little harder to detect.
---
As a tank that sleep mechanic on eranikus can be brutal if it hits me.
---
what happened to being the bigger man and stopping replying - you still went for the last word against the guy (who I've just discovered is shitting up this entire thread with aggressively-stated nonsense) ;)
---
Youre wrong by one thing the ideal is not set by people from 15 years ago. Those people were total noobs. The ideal is set by years of min maxing since vanilla came out to this day by private server users. You are definitely going to underperform if youre not using their millions of guides based on every bigger quantity of resarch.
---
However that only matters for min-maxing. You are definitely going to have fun playing the game your own way.
---
But you do know people have fun min maxing too? You are undermining their playstyle by stating that its unfun.
---
Wow thank you so much this is very helpful, and it seems promising!
---
Did you level AS protection spec? Or Did you level as ret and switch at 60? If you levelled as prot, was it a lot slower? Or were you dungeon grinding mainly? 
---
Thank you again.
---
Thanks so much Iron for spending so long making this video. He spent 12 hours editing after recording our pvp for for over 2 hours the night before. If you are on Kromcrush, we are having a massive multi guild pvp brawl at Gurubashi next Weds 9pm server!
---
Your experience waiting for a dungeon is not everyone’s experience.  You can always go kill shit while you’re waiting on group members to arrive.  Further, if you have a good group with members that aren’t below level and know the dungeon, you can run the instances repeatedly for decent exp.
---
I can't take orc warlocks with that stupid red grandma hat seriously. They always look dumb as hell, especially on their wolf mount.
---
Im a priest - shouldnt this be like a happy 3-way?
---
The challenge with a “Alt to grind gold” is you still 5-7 days played just to level. What could you earn in that time on your main? How much gear is required to efficiently grind if your not raiding on it.
---
If you want to ding 60 and farm a hunter may be more efficient. You can AOE in bad gear but it’s slower and more risk.
---
I do have alt’s but play a class you want to play and them make them a gatherer and capable of farming and you will be much better off.
---
College educated, Matthew from Chicago, make sure you pay your student loans.
---
I love Sunken Temple (really, all troll dungeons tbh). It's great XP, if you're a skinner you'll have a field day, and really all you have to do is run in a circle 3 times killing everything, then kill a bunch of "bosses" (really a couple of bosses + a ton of mini bosses). I've been farming the shit out of this on my lock, and I still enjoy it :&gt;
---
I know my Paladin is wearing a dress but now I’m thankful for it
---
Oh, that's the case ?
---
Nice dress.
---
Wait, do people not prefer keyboard trays?
---
No I agree with you, randoms don’t deserve it. 
---
I’m talking about when questing or doing a dungeon with a mage. I’ve been charged for water in an instance I was healing twice lol.
---
I don't know if I'd consider that the last word it didn't really have any substance about the subject or insults just a ok im done, but yeah I guess lol?
---
Yeah, a dick.
---
As a warrior, i dislike wearing non plate armor - its not that leather is bad, and i'll take the good bits if no one else needs em, but if there is someone to need it, i don't care about it - let them be happy that they collected another BiS piece.
---
purples or blues don't really make me excited, im all about those fruity oranges.
---
Start your own group. Offer a tank first orb for tanking live Strat.
---
Yup! Sorry for the miswording!
---
What's the population at peak hours? Low, medium, high, or full?
---
Yeah that person sucks.  I would have done the same.
---
If you ask for money before you make the water/trade, fair. I wouldn’t buy your water but I’m sure some people would. However, if you expect a “mandatory tip” and bitch on about afterwards if you don’t get one, it’s just dumb.
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/Fgq1Q9dzZ7Ryxfbt#boss=-2&amp;difficulty=0&amp;wipes=2 t
---
Please tell me how warriors are skewing these figures when we clear MC in 40 minutes? Can sure squeeze in SO many 30 minute cool downs there
---
Haha gotta day my keyboard tray is the best thing ever. Keeps the arms and wrists at proper height and keeps my desk clear.
---
A tip for killing warlocks out in the world is to sheep them and kill the pet. Then proceed to lay down the pain.
---
Ok so if providing a service you don't personally pay for allows you to charge people, how about you pay every single tank you've been doing dungeons with so far ? Without them, you would be unable to do it.
---
But they can manage without you.
---
Lately As a healer asking for mage water in an instance, I’ve simply been getting no response at all and no water. I’d rather they asked for a fee
---
I always give shaman any fish scales I have.
---
Always funny receiving underwater breathing in return for a stamina buff when I am undead lol
---
They do indeed
---
I min/maxed back fifteen years ago when I had nothing else to do.  Led raids, raided 3-4 nights a week for 3-4 hours each time, etc...
---
I am probably like you now...  I’m in my 40s and even though I have time to grind as it comes up I am certain I won’t be able to stick to any sort of normal raid schedule.
---
So with that being said I am just enjoying the leveling (54 Warlock right now).  I will still try to maximize my gear but not urgently...  I haven’t even joined a guild yet because I am looking for one that’s mature and casual yet still finds time to do content.
---
Ret paladin got the poor end of the stick. It works fine in dungeons, it's good enough for current raids, but I feel Blizzard just didn't care about ret or half asses it then never fixed it in any of the patches. I mean, look at the spellbook, it has half the spells the other 2 paladin spellbooks do if you consider every different seal's judgement a spell.
---
I don't know what I am doing with my Paladin right now. I have seen Paladins and Druids tank better than warriors in certain fights and in most dungeons, but have had multiple groups complain about it until we get past the first few bosses. Paladins do fine damage but nobody wants to group with a paladin dps, in or out of raids at 60. I feel that I need so much gear for all my specs just to be accepted into groups it is just overwhelming. Then I get pidgeon holed into healing anyway while in tank or dps spec.
---
"there’s also nothing more relieving than having a wipe saved after a bad pull because a Shaman/Druid/Pally bro had chimed in with the healing once they noticed your mana is shot."
---
Shaman here - I went oom 5 minutes before you
---
Someone with more time could edit this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cb5DITStXlI
---
you need elemental precision dude
---
You are aware you haven't backed up your claims?
---
I wish scatter shot didn't share DR with Ice Trap.
---
Only if entering the post flags you for PvP.
---
it gives you +1 stealth so you are slight harder to notice vs someone without it. thats it
---
NEs are the worse race for a rogue sadly
---
I actually had I ask somebody 4 times the other day. He said I didn’t ask after the group said ‘he still didn’t give u water?’ Lol
---
You're a bad redditor. You should stop stridently pushing your point of view, and insulting anyone who disagrees with you.
---
You were full of shit when you were arguing with the skilled warlock about fear, and you're wrong about most people's experience of heroics early in TBC.
---
You're acting like you're on the spectrum
---
Oh and I asked in /p lol
---
There was a time on private servers where a book you got rather frequently sold for 45 silver. Back then if you where lucky you got up to 40g/hr and people pulled it up to 50g/h for their youtube videos. Now the classic rogues see these old videos, do their new version and just make up a gold per hour to slap on to it.
---
Except when you're me, and you never get put into a WF group, even though you are the only warrior using a two hander in the raid.
---
🤣🤣🤣 I was there when a shaman was standing on the buggy just destroying everyone that came through. Infact I’m still leveling in Tenaris... shadow priest [awakeing]
---
glacial stone is the best 2H in 19 twink hands down.
---
Do you know if the talent 'Clever Traps' also increases the trap duration against PvP targets?
---
Do you think getting one point into 'Trap Mastery' is worth it because a resisted frost can be game over? Here I think it depends how the talent works. Eg if enemy has 5% chance to resist a trap does the talent lower that to 0% or does it decrease the 5% by 5%.
---
Considering your spec goes all the way into 'Counter Attack' why did you pick 'Improved Wing clip' over 'Entrapment'?
---
Robes are a blessing. As long as your shoulders match even just a little bit, you’ll outfashion every leather wearer in existance
---
For the most part just focus on healing yourself if you're a shadow priest. If you're about to die you can psychic scream, pop a shield, pop out of shadowform, and hit renew as you run away.
---
VE, shield, and health pots to stay alive, focus on offensive pressure.
---
Yeah I could really only remember shadowweave, my bad
---
That's smart, ty !
---
i'll give a try, ty !
---
Ret paladins/ spelladins/ tanks are the only ones that would want the T2 pally set, it's garbage for healers. I'm sure other hybrid classes have tier sets/ other stuff they'd want that don't compete with "proper" specs and classes
---
It’s impossible to answer here purely based on your server. Every economy has different prices.
---
It really comes down to how much gold you can make per hour doing other things vs. farming essences.
---
I opted to buy mike because I could make more doing other things than farming them. As an example I had an efficient group to dungeon grind and could make more gold per hour that way than farming getting 1-2 drops potentially. The risk reward of essence can be risky because the mobs tend to drop no trash and have a low essence drop rate. Whereas in a dungeon or other farming (herb/min/satyrs) it was a reliable income stream ensuring I could make a consistent gold per hour. This is especially true the lower the cost of the essence.
---
Same here my fellow druid. Same here.
---
ya we demand them to go resto kek
---
That's not even a word and I agree with you.
---
Many of us did. And linked groups were something we dealt with, whether it was blowing tons of CDs and consumables or nuking one and leashing/dying then clearing the rest after we healed up.
---
I know less about mage than I know about any other class so I have nothing to ask or contribute.
---
It's just that I made a fire mage named Searing George and I really wanted to tell somebody
---
I think their logic is calendar months not total days, as technically speaking Classic WoW has been "live" in 3 different months (august, september, october)
---
Flawed/confusing logic, sure, but logic nonetheless.
---
Yeah. Only hassle is aggro reset. Other than that it just works fine.
---
FYI Imp Weapon Totems is straight garbage, dps improvement is largely negligible.  Can't seem to find the math breakdown someone did on the sub but you shouldn't feel bad about skipping it.  Drop those points and either get flurry or get tide, imo.
---
Right? I feel the same way about all those artists that expect you to pay for their music that cost them nothing except a breath of air that belongs just as much to me as it does to them... 
---
Just buy your water from the vendor... You may pay a little more, but at least you won’t have to endure the indignity of paying someone else for their time or effort...
---
/s
---
Otoh, they're the true warlocks?
---
Why? There is a reason people roll mage because they have good dps, can sheep and food/water.
---
Dreadmist just yesterday finished their first sulfuras. There is plenty of Servers who hven't accomplished that so it can't be too empty by any means.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dmocwc/congrats_to_merlindy_dreadmisteu/

Yup, slows you down too much

Think I had an aneurysm trying to read your comment
---
Oh shit.
---
That is brilliant.
---
Don't want to rain on your parade, but unless you're doing a thousand pushups/squats/etc. a day, your weight loss is because of diet changes. The exercise is just helping your muscle tone a bit.
---
But hey, good for you man. Healthier is definitely better.
---
RP rules aren't that strict, you don't have to do anything, just don't actively grief other when they're trying to RP (unless they're opposite faction). Also they don't have to be strictly evil, demon hunters (in retail lore) also use demonic magic to hunt demons, and warlock were in every fight against every big bad.
---
"Imagine charging that pitiful elite with your huge army, wouldn't that be awesome ?" 
---
Boom, quest complete
---
u do not have dalrend, which is bis and not this damn krol blade. You also miss the DM trinket (+2% hit).
---
Not sayin that to belittle you gear, just to inform you can still farm some. Imo, its the perfect time to reroll.
---
What's wrong with MSBT? Why does it need to be over their heads?
---
&gt; Great for not going OOM on long fights.
---
Are you 10 manning MC or something?
---
People love making this argument while playing their fury warrior doing absolute trash dps.
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/character/us/kromcrush/alexandrius
---
Our ret pally does fine dps and everyone in guild loves him, so much so that we made him hand of rag this week. Is he going to beat our other top performers? Of course not, but like others said these raids are easy and I’d rather have a ret pally that puts in effort and prepares than a fury warrior that doesn’t.
---
Have any horde players that complain about no one to wpvp with tried maybe playing alliance?
---
fuck
---
With layering gone quest hotspots are now overloaded with people camping mobs. Doesn’t make much sense to stand around waiting on a few pirates to respawn every 4 minutes vs killing turtles or wolves consistently.
---
I did the grimd from 30-60 and i averaged 25-35k depending on location. You want enemies without dots or nasty debuffs, preferably 2-3 levels below you for faster kill speed and you want a place that has more mobs than you can kill before respawn cycles start. At your level i was at the gnoll camps south of camp mojache in the area you do the “alpha strike” quest. Avoid the trappers because of nets.
---
Buff party, 5 sets later, "Okay guys let's do this! Wait hold on I gotta buff everybody."
---
lol
---
I wish warlocks had non interruptable aoe
---
&gt; If the guild has cleared all the content 11/11 on the first day of reset what else would I need to be unlocked for?
---
In your case, there's nothing else as far as raid lock outs yet.  I'm more talking about in the future when there's BWL ZG/AQ/Naxx.  Even when BWL comes out, you'll still probably need to run MC with your guild every week for bindings etc... and they're going to want as fast of a run as possible with their geared raid core.  Get into the mindset that the gear that comes from raids belongs to the guild, the whole guild is getting geared out.  This is especially the case with items like Thunderfury.  It's a guild weapon, and even though one person equips it, it belongs to the guild.  It would be devastating to a guild to finally get a thunderfury, and then that player leave, it would probably end that guild.  To a much lesser extent, all of your nice gear allows you to be a more valuable member of the raid core.  
---
As far as saving your raid lockouts for your guild though, I have some old experience from this.  I was in a hardcore raiding guild in TBC through the end of WOTLK.  We were a US top 50 guild, and were the top guild on my server for the entire time we played there.  Our raid leader was fair and extremely effective, and patient to a fault.  He'd often give people second and third chances, when most of us wish he'd get rid of them.  However, one time one of our top mages (who was a bit flakey) was online during raid time and we needed him for a boss we'd killed 20 times.  "Get in the raid"  the GM said to this mage.  Mage said "I'm already saved to another raid ID."  Instant Gkick.  It's a betrayal really.  
---
One more note on classic being 7 weeks old.  In the aforementioned guild at the end of TBC was running progression raids in the Sunwell.  We were the best guild on the server, and that raid was the hardest tier until Ulduar hard modes in WOTLK, and we were stuck on 1 boss for 8 weeks.  The eredar twins, we spend 8 weeks of raiding 5 days a week banging our heads on that encounter (and we were a fantastic guild).  Our rival guild killed it 1 week sooner than we did (but we pulled ahead of them for the rest of the raid).  The next boss I think took us 5 weeks, and the last boss just took like 2 or 3 weeks.  Most of us never got 100% of our raid BiS stuff even after we cleared everything.
---
Can't travel with a desktop unfortunately.
---
Yes the freeze lasts for 5 sec, doesn’t break in damage, and can trigger shatter. So 5 seconds of 50% more crit, Fireblast and AE spam while they are frozen, followed by another frost nova, range to frost bolt for another crit, Ice block, frost nova again for another crit...
---
If you read about their lore the Shendralar are pretty fucked up. Probably first class insane. They're not Nightelves but the ancient caste The Highborne (the racename is actually Kaldorei. Nightelves is a faction).
---
And yeah they lingered there for 10000 years unable to defeat that stupid demondog there. Instead they imprisoned it with those crystal pylons but they had to sacrifice 99% of the city's population by doing so. This process coincidentally gave the prince and his followers a much welcomed power boost.
---
Fucked. Up.
---
Ret pallies are legitimately just useless though.
---
Can only get the quests at 58, so I grinded from 58-60 just doing these quests too
---
They don’t living pauldrons and the MC upgrade are green but atleast it’s dark enough to not clash too hard
---
I wish Jed always spawned in UBRS.
---
Granted. They now share cool downs.

you realize those people below max level are mostly being carried right?

Okay. I eat an apple yesterday.

Granted. Hellfire is no longer interruptable.

I don't bitch I just won't trade. I charge 10s a stack that's so cheap 60s for 120 waters / food
---
I was going for universal things that you can do in combat, but yes those too.
---
Also Sulfuras alliance. It's been pretty fun!
---
I've just hit 55 on my rogue; can I start running BRS and doing BRD emp runs? I've been lucky enough to snag HoJ so outside of quests my preBiS is done with early BRD, fortunately.
---
You HAVE to finish the grind inside MC on trash mobs. You can not finish it outside MC. Period.
---
Really? I may have to try that...
---
TSM has nice functions like disenchant sniping and telling you when selling something isn't worth it at currently undercut price, but sometimes also also don't care and just want to sell something with price instantly set to undercut, which Auctioneer accomplishes faster.
---
Implying warriors aren't the best melee DPS in the game.
---
I have run this a lot since then. I still stand by the amount per hour but I'll go ahead and break it down again today. Factoring in the raw silver per mob and rng drops. I will run this for a few more hours to check exactly the average and get back here with the results.
---
Ok so a raid with open spots already has space to carry people. How is that not to my point?
---
ofc
---
[Thi ](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/3500250502201005--50500251020001)(SM/Ruin) is what I run (though only level 52 currently).  I went straight through affliction until I filled out Shadow Mastery, then flipped to Destro and am working through it.  I really haven't decided on the level 58 and 59 talents - they'll go into either Imp. Firebolt (if I'm mostly dungeoning at that point), Imp Lash of Pain (if I'm mostly solo questing), or Intensity (if I find myself using hellfire/rain of fire more by then).  It's not a perfectly efficient spec - a lot of folks highly recommend taking Dark Pact, but I can still go for a long time without stopping to bandage/eat, and I can handle a lot of unexpected circumstances.   And yeah, I run with succubus solo and with imp in dungeons.
---
More like people who change their lifestyle to add exercise are already actively focused on being healthier, therefore they also eat healthier. The mindset change is the the cause, not the exercise. But that's significantly harder to fit on a correlation graph.
---
The damage nades are fairly cheap too aren't they? And do about twice more damage than equivalent stun nades.

Granted! He now only drops linen cloth.
---
Yes and how many thousands of man hours are wasted every day because people have to sit in a dungeon party, play nice and pretend they don’t mind that there’s a cat druid doing 30% of the hunter’s dps and objectively wasting the time of the other 4 members?
---
It’s naive of you to think that “numbers arent the only thing that matters, etc etc”, when we’re all adults now with jobs/college/social life and we can’t actually play WoW for more than 1-2 hours a day maybe, so a lot of people actually do care about the numbers and want to make the little time they have be as efficient as possible. 
---
So yes, you are free to play whatever you want and I’m glad you’re enjoying it but when picking something you know is subpar do not go and complain about people rejecting you from groups.
---
Uh you seem to be misunderstanding they have been draining immolthar to empower themselves. When immolthars power began to wane he had the shendralar slaughtered so he would remain at full power
---
You're breathtaking!

Niar dances with Vol'jin... :D  , which server is this?
---
1. I've had the same issue but I've never had to go to macro interface. Usually just using the ability or shifting forms will make the icons appear.
---
2. That is how it will work if you just bind bear form to the mouse wheel. If you want it to have a different function you will have to bind a macro.
---
/cast [noform:3] Bear Form
---
That should only cast bear form if you are not currently in bear form.
---
That's the spirit
---
It's one of many many things the addon Leatrix Plus offers (most of its features being more practical, QOL improvement things. Highly recommend.)
---
Yea, I mean ele shamans have INSANE burst damage and there should be no ways for a rogue to out-dmg an ele on trash packs. Then the ele-shaman is playing the class wrong.
---
You might not find it in-depth but you helped me out all the same. Thank you :)
---
No, I must not have stated that clearly. I don't think you were saying not to roll Need on upgrades - I think I understand your sentiment well enough - I just wanted to get a better picture of what you thought he (or anyone) *should* do instead of just what he *shouldn't* do.
---
Maybe we have different definitions of "crusade" too, because I would think that disagreeing with someone to hear the opposing argument does not qualify, but if you think it does then I am fine with being a "crusader".
---
There seems to be somewhat of a convergence on Traveler's Backpack as a gold threshold for the Need breakpoint, but you even caveat that with "most people at least", which opens up a new point of discussion: If someone already has all Mooncloth bags, are they still "allowed" to roll Need on a Traveler's Backpack? 
---
To me, it boils down to this: is it about the gold, or is it about the functionality of the item?
---
Dude just talk to your group before you start and make sure everybody is on the same page. Takes like one minute and prevents all the headaches.
---
Still using my Fist at level 38. Got Mograine’s Might to replace it. From 39 onwards. Will probably not replace til I’m in my 50 when I go Prot for endgame dungeons.
---
&gt; Why is it selfish to bring a player that's putting the extra effort AND time into performing, but okay to bring a better dps class that is underperforming greatly from what their class is capable of?
---
This is dumb.

Do you want to take your next flight in a Cessna that's going all out at 234 km/h or in Airbus A320 that's cruising at a leisurely 840 km/h?
---
You don't get points for effort, just results. 
---
And jesus christ, it's a 15 year old game. If you're rolling paladin to play retribution, then fuck you. Everyone knew it was terrible starting out, so you're just inflicting your selfish desire to fly a Cessna on everyone else in your group.
---
You can't even pretend that you're not just doing it to troll people.
---
Possibly you may have learned to take things in moderation.
---
234 km/h is 2.7529411764816e+07 barleycorn/h
---
840 km/h is 9.882352941216001e+07 barleycorn/h
---
Kikkoman! Is as far back as I can go.
---
Yup, and not just a small hassle. It's a wipe worthy hassle on some bosses. That's mainly why people look down on pally ranks. If they loose aggro, they are gonna struggle to get it back, so it puts much more responsibility on the rest of the group, to watch threat in general.
---
Alliance warriors have 2 choices: Human for pve, +10% rep and +5 swords/maces is unbeatable
---
and Gnomes for pvp.
---
If you picked a different race than these 2 you're playing this game wrong.
---
Haha, myself and my partner did 2 runs in a row, both healers, both got HoJ
---
Sure, naked is a bit over-exaggeration. But there is really no gear requirement for Mara, besides the speed enchant on boots.     
---
If played correctly, Tinker has no chance to kill you or shoot you more than few times. Tinker is the easiest of those 3 by far.     
---
Rotgrip doesn't even reach you if you know how to pull him and where to wait to reapply Doom and dots, the only "oh shit" moment on Rotgrip is if he takes 1 hydra along with him (which can still be played pretty easily, just need to care and fear the hydra, dont let it come close).     
---
On princess, especially with SM/ruin and active voidwalker (only for princess, not for other bosses) to bait out the dust aoe to stop her for a moment (and "oh shit" sacrafice of VW for shield if things go sideways), she barely can reach you.    
---
I done it as a fresh 60 with leveling gear and few easily accessible pre-BiS.     
---
Yea, I died few times at start, but that was only my mistakes that I needed to do to learn from them. Just don't rush it, don't try to squeeze more spells than necessary into cast windows (during tinker's flame breath or princess's dusty aoe) and keep your distance.
---
If you're starting a brand new character on a server . I recommend skinning and herbalism until 60. You can pick flowers along the way and either bank them and level alchemy at 60 or sell them on AH. As for skinning, every single beast you kill can be skinned. You can vendor all the lower level leather you get to basically get double the amount of gold you'd get from junk the mobs drop. It really isnt  the best money maker but if makes you extra gold which does add up as you get higher levels. I was able to get my mount right at 40 by vendoring all my leather, and putting herbs on AH. Another tip is is bags. Get bigger bags and put auto loot on, deleting items out of your bags is throwing money away. So those are usually the first things you should save up for, or keep all the cloth you get and ask someone to make them . Good luck!
---
You're comparing a calculator and desktop computer.
---
go on
---
O.k, some of the other replies are somewhat off in regards to this. The Nightelf Passive gives you a permanent +1 to your stealth level for both shadowmeld AND regular stealth. Meaning that NE's have the most powerful stealth in the game. This means that against other rogues, with good positioning and skill, you should always manage to get the opening on other rogues (unless human perception is used). It's very valuable as a means of countering other stealth users and as a added bonus it means you are harder to detect overall. It's very underrated for PVP.
---
The best advice is to just start your own groups. Instead of the LFG Lbrs. Just LFM Lbrs and the next thing you know is all those people who are prowling lfg chat will jump on board. This has saved me so much time recently
---
Yeah it's rough but kind of amusing sometimes. It can be dispelled so you just have to wait it out.
---
It's funny to watch everyone freak out as a giant dragon starts running at them and they aren't sure what to do.
---
Meme would have worked with the other door.
---
Hmm, may have him confused with Solenor. Just remember he's male!
---
On my Details at the end of an MC run our highest DPS are around 230-250 DPS (Mages, Rogues and top Warriors). Most hunters and Warlocks are around 120-180. Ret Paladins are usually 120-180 as well, so right on par with the others, and that's with not DPSing for at least two boss pulls (our two Rets switch to healing gear for Barron Geddon and Shazzrah).
---
I looked at some Warcraft Logs and I've no idea how people are hitting 400-600+. I'm guessing raid buffs and pure optimization, or I have my Details parsing settings wrong. I've NEVER seen a DPS hit those numbers, I think the highest DPS I've ever seen was from a Mage in Strat hitting about 350 and that's because of massive AOE.
---
i think that's called the "Streisand effect"
---
What is rep from 0 to exalted? Like if you add it up how much do you need?
---
Yeah i was sure i forgot a detail here and there. 
---
That makes them even more fucked up.
---
I'm actually an East coaster as well. My bro and I just moved over to Herod to play on an East Coast server cuz we are getting tired of the West Coast time schedule.
---
Inventorian isn't working for me. When I open my bags, the inventorian window is blank.
---
Tell him you'll be charging for heals if he does that.
---
To be the best, you gotta eat the best
---
Like.. I don't know why people like you even bother to comment. You obviously have no clue what the fuck you are even talking about. Stop spreading misinformation on shit you are entirely clueless about.
---
The players them selfs care, Would rather farm gold or level an alt than be stuck clearing molten core for 4 hours.
---
Sure, but having these kinds of discussions out-of-game helps to set expectations of what will happen in the group.
---
By breaking his own loot rules.
---
Copy and paste the following text in a macro, and don't start unless everyone agreed:  
---
\----
---
Hello and welcome to this dungeon group!
---
Here are the loot rules for this run:
---
Need: 
---
\-All items, BOE or BOP, regardless of rarity unless optional exempt is agreed, that are an upgrade to your class specific role assigned to your character in this specific dungeon run, that your character can wear, now or in future levels. 
---
\-All profession related items such as recipes, BOE or BOP, regardless of rarity unless optional exempt is agreed, that match your current profession, regardless of its proficiency level. 
---
Optional exempt:
---
\-All BOE epic items are an exempt to the rule, and may be rolled need by everyone. 
---
Please reply "agreed" or "agreed+exempt" before we start to set these rules for the remainder of the dungeon.
---
55 is on the edge but it is possible. However, many groups will only go down as far as 58. Some of the mobs in UBRS and other high end dungeons are 60 or higher and you will have a hard time hitting them and you will aggro from very far away.
---
Only leave as a last resort if you really need to flash heal yourself. Otherwise bandage or shield or whatever. It's not your job to heal others as shadow, but if you're in group pvp without a healer then once you pop out of shadowform to heal, don't bother going back in.
---
Have you thought about bringing in IceHUD. As this will let you have the that info in and round your it character.
---
I'm a hunter, are there PVP specific BIS lists for the classes, or is it basically the same as the regular BIS lists.
---
For example in PVP I think I would want more stamina focused enchants and specific pieces of gear vs agility. I see lists talking about best PVP trinkets and whatnot but nothing about the best gear to get you to rank 10 and beyond.
---
If rank 10 gear is the BIS, then what is the pre-rank 10 BIS for PVP.
---
Next time, please just ctrl-z
---
Would you recommend to stick with alchemy/herbalism until I’m ready for pvp and then drop herbalism for engineering? Thank you
---
it does feel like ret and druid were rushed compared to the other classes.
---
The gap is probably more narrow than that (5-10%). If I powershift on my Druid I’m easily top 10 DPS in raid. For dungeons it really doesn’t matter because most of the content just needs 5 people of the requisite level
---
Now put it on a warlock mount for true ridiculousness.
---
&gt; it fucking is if you want to maximize your DPS
---
You are shitty class leader if you are requiring best dps for mc and ony... I doubt you are farming jujus by yourself and all avaible world buffs.
---
Well yeah but it looks very different.
---
That’ll be 2g for a rez.
---
Oh, replied to wrong comment it seems
---
Someone should warn this dude. His pants are ripped.
---
How am I a bad redditor for debating a subject that the vast majority in here didn't experience in 10+ years? I'm telling you, that something that is 99% similar to what you did 10 years ago, is very different from your memory of it, since I did it frequently in those 10 years you didn't play it.
---
Why is my memory on the subject not weighed similar to yours?
---
With regards to the argument about warlock fear, I don't see how I was full of shit? I've played the class for 14 years. I should be able to tell if fear is a consistent CC or a tolerable CC, I argued the latter.
---
They are definitely doing something wrong then.
---
I bet if the onyxia stop dots man or leeroy jenkins dude asked a boomer to jump off a bridge they would do the exact same thing
---
So when do I short the market and make bank?
---
Wait if you he w bound to fire blast,  how do you move??
---
The healing pants
---
Then no heals and state they did not ask for one.
---
Why do you repost it every day?
---
I am very grateful that we can show/hide helms and cloaks. At least you can try and tweak your display to make the best out of it.
---
I feel like you don’t understand what a shield does
---
Damn, that's pretty nuts. Got a vid??
---
From Neutral 0 to exalted 0 is 42,000.
---
Just Revered to exalted is 21,000.
---
Bullshit, all of your comment. The difference isn't that big. You have presented no argument. Try again.
---
Taking some hybrids does not add an hour+ to MC. You will not wipe hopelessly in BWL or AQ because you brought some hybrids. Well, maybe your raid would...
---
You're post is way too dim to shed light on anything.
---
Try avoiding damage by kiting and have constant influx of healing by having at least sw:p+ve on one enemy up 100% of the time. When your shield is ready, apply it and use the short breather to cast a Mind Flay.
---
If you need to go out of sf against a Rogue or sth, you already lost. He will stun you and kill you.
---
Oh boy. Don’t expect to be taken to raids as a prot pally. Honestly you should just go holy. Paladins are healers, put on your dress and stand with the mages. That’s where you belong.
---
Engineering is great final profession.  A lot of people take other stuff (including tailoring so they can craft best in slot bind-on-pickup gear) then eventually drop them and take engineering.  So yeah, that would probably work well for you.
---
Where do you fish for that?
---
Shattered Halls flashbacks
---
Live to win!
---
Yup, Star Ruby, Green rings, green recipes. That's about it.
---
Cat played correctly is roughly similar to hunter damage at all tiers.  Any "dps tiers" information that doesn't include cat can be safely ignored.
---
I ran into a paladin named Lewstherin. I whispered 'kinslayer' and was met with all caps quotes yelling about Ilyena. Although, I'm not surprised someone with a Wheel of Time reference actually plays along.
---
your gear has to be decent tho, 2800 life probably wont be enough
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2pLuST9mcA
---
Or hiding one with that front piece
---
Gotcha, thank you!
---
It's a tough transition.  Losing sweeping strikes was the hardest part making 2 mobs pulls while questing hard.
---
I switched from arms to an impale prot so I still had some dps. 17/3/31. 
---
I hated it for awhile and even found tanking harder without SS/WW opener. But I found my groove and now I like it and I still actually do solid dps on packs in instances.  Shield slam is massive threat, and concussive blow I use on any big pull.  Now I uses big slow 1her on trash and Whirlwind at 25 rage for extra dps/threat. Make a quick stance change macro for it. 
---
Soloing was a lot harder at first.  Go DW 1her, and keep heroic strike queued up and you won't miss with offhand hits.    With some hit and crit gear your solo dps will be good enough.
---
I agree, that would be an easy way to immediately ignore anything coming from the smooth brain PVP chads.
---
I am leveling a pally right now, solo content does lack some fun, but they shine in groups and dungeons. I was in ZF last night did two runs the first I healed the other I was dps, but when I was a dps I was using cleanse, tossing saving heals, and keeping buffs up. As a pally you can shine in a dungeon environment.
---
What kind of comparison is that ? Music is the result of a long time investment, with payment (often) according to the skill level of the artist. Nothing to do with a click for conjure water.
---
Now there is obviously a limit (like, wtf, 6 stacks of water), but if some random asks me for a buff or something, why would i charge for it ?
---
Do you even imagine paying for any buff you receive ? Or whatever consumable you don't even need mats for ? Sorry but this is stupid.
---
And that's coming from someone giving away pots before every dungeon, which i also don't charge for. Fuck this kind of mentality honestly.
---
NPCs hates him.
---
because youre horde scum
---
i dont know what kind of wonky list you're using, but grab the fordring ring and rosevine circlet.
---
it is a trash ring. any damage taken and it do nothing.. literally nothing, for the rest of the CD.
---
Before dire maul release:
---
It's DM! It's VC! No one is going to think you mean Dire Maul with a level 19,just shift click.. No one says DM by itself. 
---
Two weeks on:
---
Everyone spells out Deadmines or says DM/VC.
---
If pvp then Engineering.
---
It's really that simple. If you need additional income it depends on if you like to roam the world (Mining) or if you are more of a Auctioneer (Enchanting).
---
Feral pvp is... not great. Your damage output is basically baselined at phase 1 while other classes see huge jumps in survivability and dps as new content comes out.
---
That's not to say druid pvp is bad. You're general strategy would be to open with cat form, apply dots, and kite/pester until dead. You'll never be a burst class in pvp, but druids are unique in their ability to dictate how a fight goes.
---
You are saying the literal definition of a word is a bad definition.
---
It's simple.  If in a group, make lots of water and pass it out to the mana users, FOR FREE.  If someone asks you for water while sitting around, not in a group, charge them for your time and services rendered.
---
yet, the single smallest slip up on any of those, and your ring now do nothing until the 30 min is up.
---
Do you communicate beforehand that you charge for hitting a button for something that disappears after logout or do you just assume people will pay you?
---
There's gotta be some PVP lists but you'd have to look around for them yourself as it's not as straightforward as optimizing PVE damage. Stamina is definitely very important.
---
Or yell at you for being in his AoE farming spot.
---
How dare you.
---
Reminds me of how idiots claimed that classes in BFA where poorly balanced because hardcore mythic+ speed runners all used the same group composition
---
I didn't need to be a genius to point out that with those players if class A is .05% better than class B ,the former will always be picked instead of the latter
---
Only if you get hit, dno if you played on private servers, but in classic this is really easy. You can basically kite all the demons. You couldn’t do that in vanilla. I did 3 tries with shadow prot potions and he reset and they were used. Then I did a final try without anything and I did it np.
---
Imagine if the fight is 1000 minutes long, then it's 12 million damage.
---
But, if I use make-up numbers and put them out of their perspective... who cares right?
---
Because no one wants to farm hundreds of pummelers. No other class has a weird outlier edge case so dependent on a unique consumable like that.
---
Absolutely correct.  Well done.
---
Play whatever you want, don't expect me to waste my time playing with you if you've chosen to make things take longer.
---
Just go play lottery at this point
---
I have no clue what the spreadsheets say haha, this is just my personal view. I do play with basically all AGI gear so crit chances are higher, which probably makes Ravage worth it.
---
Really shouldn't be taking deathbringer from your furies as a tank.
---
If you check what most high tier tanks are doing they are going for daggers (perditions + CHT)with ACLG or muggers. DB is an incredibly low drop rate and most guilds have a ton of warriors lined up to get it. 
---
As horde most rogues are going to be swords because of the benefits of windfury and that means there's going to be a ton of excess daggers to go around. If you go for DB you are seriously fucking your raids DPS over and you are gona end up trashing a bunch of daggers anyway. Don't shit on your warriors, just take the daggers. 
---
DB is certainly the superior weapon if you are talking overall TPS over a long fight, but most fights in MC are under a minute and having the consistency of daggers is generally better.
---
Think I might move channeling points to that
---
I thought there was a setting in /msbt that allowed you to enable overhealing on HOTs but I could be mistaken.
---
rosevine circlet and the fordring ring.  I don't know what kind of weird BIS list you're using where that ring even comes in the top 5.
---
the 50 stamina isn't gone for 30 minute whenever you take damage.
---
copy pasting..
---
Lol.. it’s rogue.
---
Easily the worst comment in the thread.
---
BIS doesn't mean it's optimal for the raid for a tank to take it.
---
Get a Staff of the Warden and you can tank all pre-raid content with ease. We have a druid healer who offspeccs between raids and we had no trouble whatsoever in all dungeons (DMT, Scholo, UBRS, etc).
---
Granted! Heals now restore 0 health and don't show up on the threat table.
---
Classic doesn't really have rotational complexity I'm afraid, even on a basic level by modern standards. The game was made to be played by people on dial-up internet.
---
Dam 5 epics? How tf, I didn’t even know there was an epic item at level 25 lol
---
Lmao this
---
So I need to do 840 quests to unlock wintersabers. 
---
Hmm. That's a lot.
---
You should youtube Shedo. He has videos of himself pulling like 700-1000dps IIRC. Your only limitation is mana which makes alliance much more attractive.
---
Are there guides on rep? Like, for example, being a Troll and wanting that hella dope Kodo mount, is there any guide on how to get enough rep before lvl 40 to be able to get that?
---
in classic, not in wrath. cause we had dailies in wrath.
---
look up the repair bill of plate VS cloth,  add up the amount of wipe people went through cause they were friggin horrible back in 2005, and you'll understand how.
---
I never raided Naxx but AQ40 was definitely hard when I played vanilla. Replayed again on Pservers (and yes, they're pretty damn accurate) and it's a cake walk.
---
I remember all raids being pretty tough, but ever since I started playing Pservers I just noticed it really wasn't. In perspective to what we had back then it was pretty hard, but in todays standard is was all pretty stupidly easy.
---
I'm sure they do, it's a crime of opportunity lol.
---
Check again.
---
Yeah DPS are rarer and healers are endless in classic it's kinda shit
---
You can only have one flair so you have to decide if theme (pvp/pve/etc) is more important than content (art/humor/discussion). I think more people would be inclined towards the latter when they use tags to search or filter posts.
---
copy pasting from above...
---
 Yeah yeah i know the 15/31/5 build from wowhead, you don't have to tell me your build when every other rogue is using the same one.  
---
I mean if you came into this thread to try and prove the OP right you did a great job.  
---
I'm not even going to bother attempting to wrap my head around you "trying" seal fate daggers without having aged core/muggers/perditions blade and coming to the conclusion it doesn't work because of that...  I mean if i tried to bake a cake without an oven it would be a pretty shitty cake, does that make cake shit?  
---
It's no skin off my nose either way, but in a few weeks when your guild rogues start getting more and more gear i can promise you the good ones won't be staying cookie cutter spec...
---
It's okay though you're literally not the first person to die on this hill.
---
They're also the most consistently braindead players I've come across.  I've wiped more times because of a mage doing dumb shit than any other class.
---
For the wintersaber tiger specifically I believe you have to do a starting quest until you hit 3000, after that it opens up the other grind quest. That grind quest you must do 850 times.
---
Nah i hear you. Im always on my last item/mob with the mob at 1% hp when i get ganked hahaha
---
&gt;who competes with your other 8 mages for the exact same gear
---
I'm with you but this is a terrible argument. Fury wants leather and all casters want cloth with a very few exception. he only thing they aren't competing for is tier and there I'm with you.
---
I feel like people are talking about two different things here.
---
I don't think anyone is against hybrid classes, because we are all aware of the utility they have. The issue is the particular specialization they want to play as that is suboptimal.
---
A holy paladin can bring the same amount of utility as a ret paladin. one might argue it is a much more interactive style of playing, especially if you make it a point to judge light/mana.
---
Sure they can do damage, all characters can, but its not good damage. they are overall much better healing. why would you want to limit yourself to a mediocre spec when you can do so much better for your team as a healer?
---
this is a true mmo, more so than retail at this point. it's about working together and over coming these raids. at the end of the day, play how you want, that is your right. but if you want the right to play that way, what gives you the right to argue when other players who dont agree do not want to invite you to their raids or groups?
---
you can can say they are ignorant and flavor of the month try hard and they can call you a moron for playing a shit spec as well. both parties are allowed to play how they want.
---
if you want to be a ret or enhance meme lord then run your own raid or guild with your off spec buddies and have fun.
---
Ha.. apologies.. I thought you were correcting the comment above you.. not OPS toon name
---
Yes he is, Franklin the Friendly.
---
Yes prot palies can tank every 5 man (and probably 10 man as well) without much hassle. As said previously, bosses that drops aggro are your biggest problem, but they're far and few in between.
---
As a prot paly, while leveling, I did every 5 man up to BRD, and some DM. In some cases, with groups with alot of aoe, going with a paly tank was easier because of all the aoe threat.
---
but there's only 1.. maybe 2 of you to mark the entire raid.
---
i'll still take your innervate
---
LF DPS for deadmines east.
---
I agree. I take great value from knowing what is BiS for my class / spec, what talent points give me the best bang for buck, where it's most efficient to go - And then not do any of it because I enjoy fishing.
---
Still the knowledge gives me a goal to eventually get to, at some point.
---
Hey guys, happy Friday!
---
I'm a mage, and I recently crafted my Robes of the Archmage. Is there any reason for me to keep tailoring past this point? 
---
Lmao people start comparing conjuring water with something that actually takes skill and serious time investment (i.e. Music) 😂 get real, this is a game, you lost touch with reality.
---
So then how do you strafe?
---
Thrash blade becomes Trash blade around 55. Linken blade’s speed + design is more my play style
---
For once rouge gets to be the right answer. A truly historic day!
---
Yea you have a point. Perhaps its more up to the community to add [PvP] in front of their titles.
---
Lol, mages charging for something they can do for a little amount of Mana that gets regenerated after a couple of seconds... Total jerks...
---
I have a gnome mage and I gladly yell "free water/food" in Stormwind just to fuck with those guys.
---
Who are they putting in the group instead? 2hand warrior would be my first priority after tanks
---
What are the swords?
---
Oh god I forgot how bad the clown outfits were in TBC.
---
You wont be able to do that. The most rep you can get is starting off in Mulgore and doing all TB rep quests. Then you still need to donor alot alot of runecloth to get to exalted. You can pretty much only do this at lvl 60. If you didnt start in Mulgore, it just means more runecloth to buy from /2.
---
Make use of your sprint ability I'd say. Unfortunately there are just some tuff matchups. Try and farm the tidal charm trinket, it stuns target for 3 seconds and is said stated to be able to be used from max 30 yards. This could definitely help with kite/evading.
---
Shamans and their fucking totems who remove buffs
---
Just get the t0 bracers and be done with it
---
My main is a shadow priest: super fun, love being able to pop out and heal if shit starts going south, but just shit viability and you're basically not allowed to do anything in raids.
---
My alt is a mage: All of the viability, groups can always use mages, but spamming frostbolt for 2 hours is just boring af.
---
This is a game that I don't think is for everyone. When I started, I honestly didn't think I was going to get hooked due to all of the games with instant gratification now. Classic, to me, has a similar appeal as something like Dead Souls but in a different genre. You always feel weak, and the enemies constantly feel too strong. Then, you get through that section and feel accomplished. Yeah, it was hard, but you did it. 
---
Last night, I was trying to solo an elite quest in northern WPL and got killed. It was a 10 minute walk back to my corpse. I was pissed and ready to just quit for the night right then and there. Rez and the spirit healer and say F it. I didn't. I got back to the quest objective and saw a mage farming mobs, asked for help, and easily completed the quest. Just like that, I was having fun again. 
---
This game is a massive grind, and so often you ARE just pressing 1 or 2 buttons over and over. It is about more than that though. It is about the journey from being a nobody to being a hero. That journey isn't for everyone. It is a long hard journey on some days, and many don't like want to continue that journey. That is fine. If you aren't having fun, cancel your subscription and find something that you do enjoy. As a whole, we spend too much time trying to enjoy things that others enjoy even if we don't just because we think that we should and something is wrong with us. We have different tastes. Not everyone will like the same type of game.
---
But then you have to look at a gnome every time you play. Absolutely not worth it
---
Just checked the history, he’s been posted at least once a day for a week!
---
Yes I was. Ran UBRS at 58 and was very lucky
---
Thorns tho???
---
If that's true, then maybe our fury tanks are shite, who knows.
---
Haha it’s all I needed
---
That hammer from DM North tribute is good aswell, and not as expensive.
---
Can you too in BFA ? Or at least from when Worgens got playable ?
---
Ugh I know! Thank you
---
Hey no worries mate. I leveled purely as a prot paladin after I got concecration. Questing is basically out of the question as a prot, because it is real slow. I spammed dungeons basically. Level as ret to 21, then change to prot (you need concecration). Hit me up if u got any more questions :-)
---
Same level of effort required for a Rogue to click Pick Lock to open your lockbox, or showing up with your own mats to have an item crafted, where a tip is also expected... 
---
Spent gold throughout the whole leveling process to upgrade the Conjure skill, so there’s your long term investment... 
---
You are a cheap ass who expects someone to stop what they’re doing to trade you a free stack of water for nothing but a thank you... Fuck THIS kind of mentality honestly...
---
Again... Buy your water from the vendor! No need to worry about this in that case!
---
Play style? What does that even mean? You just use slice and dice and sinister strike.. and Sinister Strike gives no fucks about weapon speed or DPS, only damage (which Linken's Sword has very little of)
---
It's objectively a bad weapon for rogues.
---
I'm on Grobbulus but sometimes I regret not rolling on BB. :(
---
Yeah, I was definitely referring to tanking with the MCP.
---
Imp ghost wolf ends up saving your ass more than you'd think it would.
---
 You are correct. I have a full time job, so unless I sacrificed virtually all my sleep, I would be unable to reach rank 14. Thats fine, I can enjoy the game without rank 14, but the grind is rather ridiculous when you think about it. That was my point. Perhaps I was being a bit hyperbolic, but not by much :P
---
oh, some straw man bashing. havent seen that in a while
---
If you are rich go for Annihilator + Flurry axe. 
---
If you are poor get Rivenspike + Bone-slicing hatchet or x2 Bone-slicing.
---
Don't bother with QS + edgies
---
Get muggers belt and and let your rogues know you are going to be taking some raid daggers. If you take deathbringer from your furry warriors you're actually an asshole. 
---
As horde there should be plenty of daggers to go around and most warriors at the highest tiers of gameplay go Perdition's + CHT for the consistency of threat in short fights and because taking DB from fury warriors is just a net loss for your raid.
---
Oooo that’s good
---
Don't think druid can pull as much threat
---
I don't want to switch my settings (muh immersion) so I zoom in minimap to the max and walk towards the dot, which results in me standing directly on top of the herb.
---
🇪🇦👉🚪
---
DO NOT TEMPT ME!
---
But do I really NEED a job? 🤔
---
Well sure but the problem is that not everybody who plays is active on reddit or any other forums. They just play the game. Still have to communicate in-game.
---
For raiding, do you Sanc the tanks or is it good to cover everyone? We don't have any Sanc Paladins right now, so I'd be the only one to cover.
---
Ok, thanks. I've just gone with a temporary fix of reloading the game, which fixes it most of the time.
---
I find your lack of /spit disturbing.
---
Paladin here, so a foursome?
---
people completing tier sets already and I'm only just dinging 43 here.. ugh
---
I wish I didn't have to work so much, i feel like im going to miss out or be so far behind when i finally hit 60 and want to raid
---
Haha I love that attitude, it’s be nice if guides had more like second and third options listed so I can try and make progress even if some items are out of reach
---
by blowing up and killing anyone near...
---
I guess it all has to do with how it's done, rather that what is actually being done.
---
If i was to ask a mage for water, i'd /wave in front of him or something. And not to someone actively doing something, but like, maybe someone sitting in front of a bank ? Anything other would indeed be rude.
---
As you said, time is valuable, so asking for a bit of time from someone would require reducing said amount of time as much as possible, that would be a given.
---
I'll be honest, i didn't think of the possiblity of mages getting constantly asked for water or something, i thought of this as occasional, with people having some kind of basic manners. Is it that bad or ?
---
I mean the side of being a mage where you don't blink giant packs of mobs while the healer is oom, start spamming arcane explosion, forget to frost nova the pack, miss your blizzard, die, then complain about the tank not keeping aggro. You know, that side of being a mage.
---
I reserved that name, I'm sure as hell gonna stare at it all the time! :')
---
I always ask for a fee beforehand. And only for randos. If you are in my party for a du geon you get all the food water and portals you need.
---
If I have to take time out of my activities to serve you. I wi charge for that.
---
I wish it was that cheap, it runs 1k+ on my server, will prob get even more expensive when phase 2 hits.
---
Is +dmg capped? I doesnt seem i get full bonus dmg from my gear
---
I'm just gonna start needing on all items, if the justification for "uhr dur AH spec I need epic BOE to make gold" is valid the  I'm just going to need on absolutely everything that drops because that's a consistent gold income. I need gold too brahhhhh
---
Thanks! That's not a bad shout actually. Dungeon levelling.. never tried it but I guess as a tank you get groups assembled very quickly? My pally is like level 11 at the moment and already spent some points in ret... so i'm on the way!

I read powerlifting and was really confused for a moment
---
I have Dal Rend in my off hand. Both blades are 1.80 speed, and Linken has a chance on hit dmg ability which scales with my Attack power. 
---
Like you said, I pop slice n dice and go to town with VERY swift sinister strike spam. Play style :)
---
Achieve the crit soft cap is definitely achievable. Very difficult though, so good for you! 
---
What I was questioning whether it was achievable or not was the hit Hard Cap, which is 25% as a human/orc with appropriate weapons.
---
&gt;Deviat Supreme
---
Are those the items that change how you look?
---
I'm not sure if this was meant to make me like Hunter or not. Its having a mixed effect.
---
Liking gnomes is an acquired taste. 
---
You will like it after some time. Probably.
---
Ah fair enough
---
Epicus Maximus?
---
Mooncloth cd for a steady small income. Once ZG comes out you get your next BiS in form of a Tailoring recepie, so youll want tailoring then. Many people drop tailoring inbetween though.
---
Aka find time to level that pesky fishing / cooking
---
You'll be fine as human. It's not quite as good as escape artist, but perception is like a free stealth detection potion.
---
No, you're being selfish and lame asking people to only play cookie cutter specs using cookie cutter builds on a game where it's the least nessecary to do so.
---
People that really wanted to raid took down almost everything in classic with what ever specs they wanted. How come it's so important you need these min/maxing now a days when we play on the most nerfed version of vanilla? Sigh @ people like you.
---
You either sucks so much you need an entire raid min/maxed to down bosses, or you're an selfish egoistic elitist. That's a fact.
---
Nothing hurts more than getting friend zoned virtually after getting friend zoned IRL.
---
Oof, re-arrange your setup until you no longer find it comfortable to do this, man. No matter how good the game, it isn't worth back problems in 5 years.
---
Investing in a good chair (and in some cases, desk) that makes you have good posture is well worth the money, imo.
---
Ya exploiting areas guards cant get to you will result in some form of discipline
---
Did you read what I wrote? 
---
It is a decent ring as Long as you have an alternative to equip as soon as you have taken damage so the Regeneration stops. 
---
Until then it is a very decent ring with 22 mp5. 
---
When it is on CD ofc you should equip rosevine circlet as an alternative. But for a lot of dungeons it is quite nice to have the extra mana Regeneration if you have a decent Group and don't get AOE hit by anything
---
But I agree it is not a very good ring. But useless by no means
---
Think 4-5 parts of the beaststalker set is bis for atleast phase2, has alot of stamina
---
That makes sense. I have a mix of bear and cat gear, so I don't see as many juicy crits...so I probably wouldn't be as attracted to ravage as you might be.
---
I also generally play druid like...well, a druid: pop out, throw cooldowns, etc. I have *never* cared about dps meters and I never will.
---
I thought The Cleaner showed up?
---
T1 is a very good pvp set for druids
---
ahh my decision to roll pve is continually affirmed by threads like this.
---
Picked up my leaf, already had the sinew, and had the bow 12 hours later. Some alliance watched the Klinfran and Artorius fights, but that's all. the animosity just isn't there.

Hey thanks a bunch for this, very informative and useful. Last question I promise!
---
&gt; Mana regen doesn’t stop until you CAST the spell. Cast bar does NOT stop regen, so you can regen while casting the spell.
---
Is that the case for channeled spells like Mind Flay? Or tranquility? It ticks multiple times, does it count as "cast" as soon as you start channeling, or when the channeling ends? Thanks

---
As someone who played ret in a raiding guild in Vanilla up to Naxx (when I quit WoW the first time lol) keep at it :)  I couldn't put myself through the same heartache twice in a row though, was hard enough as it was establishing myself the first time around sadly
---
Rets are shit, it obv hits too close to home for some.  You’ll have to face the facts sooner or later m8.
---
I've read that knowingly 'helping' them is griefing and actionable by Blizz, no idea if it's true though
---
Agreed. Even if you are far from optimized, you can can easily push the "cutting edge" content (=clear raids). Consumables and gameplay are more important than gear in most cases. Having optimized gear only makes your MC run few mins faster..     
---
The only exception is Fire resist set for one of your tanks, which is pretty much mandatory for Rag.  
---
Ps: I'm looking forward to phase 2 and world PVP with all those people sticking to the bis lists and having no stamina at all :D Free honor :)
---
I'd use it if I were main-tanking a raid boss.  It's also a fantastic stat stick for leveling.  Definitely not essential outside of that, unless you just enjoy min-maxing.
---
Having the erro "3D acellaration" when clicking on Play. Installed new drivers, directx, disabled full screen, ran as admin, updated windows, nothing is working. Any idea guys?
---
Fairly cheap,  but I can 2x the stun grenades on a craft.
---
I've got enough iron and stone to make potentially 100 nades in my bank, so it's been pretty great for me to just craft a stack before heading out.  
---
For me it beats swinging and alt tabbing, but of course it's not for everyone.
---
I've no idea on that one seeing as his q &amp; e buttons are also bound.
---
I'm horde on Dreadmist and its not empty at all. Pretty sure its status is on high throughout most of the day.
---
Lol except I ran with a out this week with a druid OT and we downed rag in 3 hours. So it might not be optimal, but it works. I'd take a competent feral tank over a dumb warrior any day.
---
*banish*
---
Hoj, yes. The blackrock one, not sure considering it's incredibly hard to get enough hit in dual wielding.
---
Well its glaringly obvious that there is serious imbalance on those servers just from the open world. I think there were stats before but are out of date now.
---
What if i enjoy the speed aspect of it?
---
Still better than sylvanas
---
I glad for you, I'm not enjoying it at all.   Grinds always suck, and the rewards are rarely, if ever, worth it.  Telling people to enjoy the grind when they clearly are not is being a bit of an ass.
---
Start by booking it to Concecration then heading down the Prot tree.
---
Around level 35-40 you can really start open world AOE farming too.
---
Get yourself a Green Tower and throw a thorium shield spike on it and AOE yourself some wolves in Badlands to get the hang of it. 
---
It can be slow at first, but once you get to 60 and have some SP and more "Thorns" damage you can pull more and kill them quicker.
---
&gt; switches chart to DPS druid
---
wow holy shit, Moonkins are doing double DPS as ret paladins. Ret really is fucking broken in Classic
---
1.  I dont know about right clicking, but you can type /pvp and it'll toggle your pvp status.  On a PVP server this is basically useless.  It only matters in uncontested zones and there's no real point to turn it on.  Turning it on makes you attackable to the other faction, so on a PVE server where you normally can't attack horde players as alliance that horde player would turn red and be attackable if they turn on pvp.  In my experience, the PVP flag is 100% useless because people on PVE servers really don't want PVP and PVP server players don't need to use it.
---
2.  yes, this danger of always being killed is the point for most pvp players.  they like the added challenge and danger of having to watch out for the opposing faction or like to have the change to attack them and claim a mob, camp, herb, ore, etc.   In your scenario, you just hope those patrolling 60s kill you once and then let you be but sometimes they're a bunch of a-holes and you basically have to leave the zone or log onto a alt for a while until they're gone or call for back up from your fellow faction players.  Happened to me last night actually.  Winterspring.  Theyre were 5-8 lvl 60 alliance players riding around killing all of us horde trying to level, so I just logged out for the night and played something else.
---
It doesn't on allied players
---
How much did you make?
---
He's also kinda implying warriors aren't allowed to use a 2H for solo content or PVP
---
Same experience for our guild. 1 binding in the first clear. 1 eye of Sulfuras in the second clear. And two days ago, we got both bindings back to back. I'd say, if we get any more bindings before phase 3 (and I feel liek we will) then something has to be different.
---
Granted, but for balance reasons your armor is severely lessened.
---
Try to disable all other addons and Enable only this and see if it works then.
---
I feel your pain.  Had to do ALOT of runs also for my HoJ
---
was 3 manning it with guildies doing stealth runs and it finally dropped this week. Was losing my mind for it :)
---
now just need to farm 1 more for our feral druid who helped us then everyone in our guild has one!
---
Fuck dude, I don't know if there's much room for improvement here.
---
Maybe get a pair of those yellow Gunnar gaming glasses and a vape?
---
Literally had people harassing me non-stop yesterday over ignoring some guys.  People are petty, yes they are going to do that.
---
is there any updated list on things that still hasn't been fixed /aren't true to classic? While playing i'm having a lot of "uhm that's seem different" moments, but i'm not sure if it's just my memory (most likely) or the game. Like there's just some shit that seems so "off" to me
---
Cursed image
---
in a world where bosses die in a minute or two and I don't have time to run out of mana.
---
more mana is useless if I don't run out of mana.
---
Paladin can also farm pummelers.
---
&gt; Maybe I should be talking to our officers about actively recruiting more members so we can field a second raid team or start split raiding when we have the gear and numbers for it.
---
This is the thing to do.
---
Who cares! It’s level 30 loot. Get over it. It’s not important.
---
They really aren't.
---
Ret Paladin is a fundamentally broken spec in Classic. It *doesn't work.* It does half the DPS of Feral Druid, that's how broken it is.
---
Yeah, it’s definitely a dps weapon. It was actually removed from the tank BiS on fight club for that exact reason- its suboptimal for a raid to give it to a tank.
---
Better for the tank to get edgies/QS imo.
---
A group of friends and I ran every dungeon but WC with a pally tank (lock,mage,Hunter,priest) and cleared everything with ease. As mentioned, bosses that reset aggro can be a challenge only because your group has to play smart in those encounters. Prot pallys are awesome especially with aoe pulls. But I would expect to go holy for endgame unless you’re lucky enough to have a guild who needs an OT badly.
---
It's incredibly easy for a rogue to get to the soft hit cap of 6%.
---
If this is how you dungeon boost you are doing it very, very wrong.
---
The correct way to do it is have the 60 pull all/how ever much of the dungeon they can handle without doing damage to the mobs while the char getting boosted stays well back and avoids getting into combat.
---
When the mobs are all rounded up the level 60 leaves the group and the low level throws EZ throw Dynamite at the pack or does a rank 1 AOE to tag the mobs.
---
The level then proceeds to AOE the mobs down and the low levels gets 100% of the mob XP.
---
yep, you start as hostile unless you get the "For the Horde" pre-order DLC
---
Hey, rogues are cool man ( unless your the opposite faction lol), it's them mages you need to be wary of.... swear like 80% of them are dicks.
---
As mentioned, escape artist is really good and especially for gnome so you have to weigh what you value most, the looks of your character or the perks in PvP. Have you considered dwarf? It's a middle way since stone form is better than human racials but still not as good as escape artist but maybe you can accept that look easier than the gnome
---
Ye honestly go into mana tide and give it to your locks and you're gonna improve the overall dps by more than that from reduce time spent tapping
---
 Hibernate is relevant in BWL IIRC.
---
\^\^That doesn't mean I would take oomkin into my BWL raid though
---
Risky click of the day.
---
quest wars i think
---
hey hey, 83% okay
---
I'm so glad you posted this. I asked in the questions thread once why everyone always harps about "get the slowest weapon" instead of "get the weapon with the highest top end damage" and got REAMED by people who don't understand or have no reading comprehension.
---
The horror.
---
mp5 is the reason healers don't run out of mana
---
good mp5 makes it so there's no downtime between trash pulls
---
The lore ruined sylvie. Consider it non cannot like post season 4 game of thrones.
---
4 Spirit for mages is 1 mana per tick (2 seconds) or 2.5 mp5, according to formulas such as [this one](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Spirit). I've found this number to be belieavably accurate on a level 60 mage. Now, this is mana reg while not casting. A typical raiding mage gets 45% of that (18 pts Arcane spec + Mage Armor) while casting, so 1.125 mp5 out of every 4 spirit.
---
On a 2 minute duration fight, 4 spirit gets you 27 points of mana regenerated. 4 int gets you 60 mana base, + 10% if you are AP specced. Meaning, on a 5 minute fight (continous casting!) spirit pulls just barely ahead - but you probably can't cast 5 minutes non stop without a big focus on int/mana pool.
---
Naturally, the value of spirit drops further if you don't have 18 points in arcane or run a different armor spell and rises a bit if you have casting breaks in your fights.
---
Do free action potions release you from druid's entangling roots? If not, is there any way a rogue who is faerie fired can break root? For some reason 2/2 Improved Sprint doesn't work.
---
I like being an enhancement healer. hitting things with my beat stick and helping everything move quicker.   don't have to heal and drink up if they drop quick
---
&gt; acting like parrots to a flawed ideal that was set by people almost 15 years back who had no idea what they were doing
---
Tbh the "ideal" that people are looking at today was set just a few years ago on private servers.
---
Back in vanilla people brought all kinds of classes and players, even the top guilds in the world. These days top guilds consist of 50% rogues and warriors.
---
But otherwise i agree with your post :) (Playing oomkin myself and having a blast).
---
30% haste for 5 seconds would be good for threat, but the fact that I'd lose 5 weapon skill makes me question whether it would beat Brutality Blade. I just don't know. It's 1% crit, 9 strength, 9 agility, and 5 weapon skill (so 3% hit) vs a 4 agility and chance on hit to give 30% haste (which has been extensively tested to have a proc rate of once per minute, so roughly 8..3% uptime).
---
I dunno man. Seems to heavily favor Brutality Blade. I've also heard rumors it doesn't stack with flurry, but that wouldn't matter for deep prot, but fury prot wouldn't benefit from it then.
---
Since when do warriors not use 2h for pvp though?
---
That's a problem with you bringing a shitty cat druid, not with the spec itself.
---
Yeah that's not at all what I'm talking about here lol that rogue is just a dumbass and should just be kicked and replaced.
---
link doesn't work
---
Prep for phase 2 ... im talking hundred of free action potions etc... mark my words
---
It does im using it to do just that
---
Go into the optioms and turn the setting on, dpnt use miks as default..
---
Right - discussion is required in Classic. 
---
I guess my curiosity stems from these kinds of situations, where a new (or naive) player has a really bad experience before he realizes that, and what a better solution is.
---
Fair enough. I do though - even as a druid with innervate. Maybe your raid is taking too many healers and could improve time even further with swapping 1-2 for damage Dealers?
---
Either way I do get oom in fights and I look for mana Regeneration as well. Although I don't have a lot of the pre raid bis gear yet so it might be that my mana will be OK too once I get some more +heal on my gear and have to throw less heals...
---
Will have to see.
---
But on the pre-raid bis list on Wowhead it is defenitely part of the pre-raid bis for heal druids.
---
I can see how fordring ring and circlet are way better though and would never even think of farming this ring myself. It just seems too useless most of the time and I won't swap anything for sure because I smoke way too much weed to remember that stuff xD
---
I visualized this in my head, but now that it's in front of my eyes, I understand.
---
Damn that's a rough one. Where's this used? I tried to find it through Google but couldn't find it
---
So yeah, you're treating "viable" as a black-and-white descriptor.
---
Okay, BRB doing Ony with 40 shadow priests because it's "viable"

Logs from the top 10 speed running guilds in the world. Only 1 of them is even running expose. The strategy you're proposing isn't a thing.

Especially ones like live strat where warrior tanks don't need the loot drops. That might have been why it was so hard to find a group

---
Downvoted, cause that asshole STILL HASN'T DROPPED HIS STUPID DAGGER.
---
Yeah, that's the issue these days. Rank 14 is based on the comparison between you and everyone else on your server. Which I think this aspect is cool, only going to be a few Rank 14s ever, but todays culture is not what it was when WoW came out. There are people who literally play video games for a living who can no life, cut sleep, and make it unrealistic for anyone with any semblance of a life to reach even above rank 11 or 12.
---
Definetly this, however games nowadays are all like this. The industry has designed games for high turnover so I feel like there are more of these players aswell.
---
Meanwhile we had like 5 hunter BoE's drop and nothing but shammy and warlock gear drop in our MC lol.
---
Also three weeks in a row Perdition's Blade off of Rag.
---
This is how its supposed to be. Enjoy your stay
---
Before he starts, yes. If he’s fighting, no. If ANYTHING other than the hunter gets on the demon’s threat table, it despawns immediately.
---
20 AP is a huge difference in a slot. I'm not necessarily defending a hunter rolling over a melee on HoJ, but just that a 20 AP upgrade isn't a huge one.
---
Some of the most coveted items in the game are right around 20 AP better than extremely easily attainable other items.
---
Cape of the black baron is exactly 20 AP better than random blues with 15 agi that you can buy on the AH for 15g.
---
Truestrike shoulders is 24 AP better than a green from a BRD quest that just gives 2 hit.
---
When you boil it down to AP equivalency, only the absolute 2 best tier 1 pieces are 20 AP or more better than PreBis pieces for hunter in MC.
---
If a 20 AP upgrade on a single slot isn't worth farming, then you might as well tell people to start raiding in full greens because almost all of the PreBis items have very easy to obtain items that are within 20 AP of them.
---
Again, as a hunter if I was on ally I probably wouldn't ever roll over a melee on HoJ before DM came out (and never afterwards), but the 20 AP part of your arguement is very weak.
---
Also, I don't think blackcrow is a good example either. Any melee should absolutely roll need on blackcrow with a hunter because blackcrow is actually more of an upgrade for melee than it is for hunters compared to the other items available. It does less damage than Carapace Spine crossbow from strat which is very easy to get, but ends up slightly ahead only because of the hit. So it's a weapon downgrade that you only take because it has an extra hit stat, which means hunters get less from it than melee do. This is also no longer relevant because of DM though.
---
Fixed, thanks
---
garrosh was roughly 25 years old during classic, where are you getting 5 from?
---
Excuse you, us Dwarves were created by the planet-sized space aliens that gave Trolls the opportunity to evolve beyond bacteria as a byproduct. We build cities in fuckin' *mountains* and our entire culture is centered around not giving a shit.
---
Trolls got displaced by their prettier cousins. And then got displaced by those pretty cousins' exiled rejects. And then got displaced by the humans, who were also exiled rejects. All of whom have built their own empires while Trolls are still living in huts. Who's the genetic reject here, laddie?
---
You should have killed the hunter
---
If you're on Deviate Delight I've been seeing it every 6th-8th run or so and would be happy to grind it with you.
---
That's a bit different, but interesting nonetheless.
---
Same, they truly are the new «huntard» class
---
Still easier than other healers because you only have to manage that one buff, and it's a 30/60 minute buff.
---
Layer good? I thought layer bad?
---
Good that you took a screenshot, but then you butcher it like that instead of blurring.
---
Looks like Kafka from FF6
---
There’s guaranteed 2+ rich thorium veins at the end of DM east. It’s clearable by 2-3 players depending on class. No point mining anywhere else. 
---
If you’re just leveling blacksmithing and don’t want to do DM east, just buy the ore. Prices should be rock bottom due to DM east farming.
---
You also bubble, then LoH
---
Well, some people are going to make fun of hybrids for good reason. A lot of the jokes are fun. I even call myself oomkin instead of boomkin.
---
And i can see the logic behind wanting to get a better dps class rather than a hybrid class to clear a dungeon faster.
---
Its the same as a handicapped player cant blame the NFL coach for not recruiting them to the team.
---
Some people want the optimal stuff, let them.
---
If you are having a hard time finding a group then create your own.
---
/faden
---
horde and ally slaying each other over it
---
That is how it meant to be.
---
I just got ironfoe as an orc warrior. How good is this? My current MH is Tooth of Eranikus. I primarily tank. I’m currently arms spec with axe specialization.
---
My hunter guildie had me duel him for the silithus one so i could put curse of recklessness on him, so he couldnt get feared.
---
I’m holy
---
But what are the odds of getting it the next run, when you did not get it the past 100 runs? Surely it has to drop soon, right?
---
Been on Bloodfang since day 1 and it's been a blast so far. Great server
---
Use gouge and kick yo. Just sayin. Good fight though!
---
In fairness, this happened back in classic as well. There was a \*lot\* of resistance to bears tanking raids, then.
---
Love to win
---
vendor strike has a 100% drop rate
---
this is known
---
I am just as surprised when it happens, most of the time the groups are fine with it. But the chance is there.
---
I also feel bad for wasting peoples time, but that's why I try to be open before the dungeon about it.
---
Remind me to post a pic of my UI. I take it to an minimalist extreme.

---
Don't worry, there's so many people in your situation, new guilds keep popping up all the time. Even if you are behind others, you will still have a good, fresh experience
---
That is cheap imo.
---
I remember doing this quest in vanilla, it's part of the reason I didn't go hunter again. Expect to get grieved by both factions.
---
I was torn about levelling my first alt - a warrior to have a tank or warlock fun. My head says warrior, but my heart says warlock. 
---
What's the best warlock race? Gnome or human? I know gnomes have the int racial, is it worth it?
---
Granted, you now generate hate. When the amount of hate you generate gets to an amount higher than your party members the group of mobs will chain CC you.
---
I thought all the phases would be rolled out by the end of 2020
---
As far as comments on Wowhead go (https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11684/ironfoe#comments), Windfury Totem can't proc from it, that's may be why it isn't recommended for Horde. However, in 5mans you will not always have a Shaman, so I think it's mainly a discussion regarding tanking in raids.
---
Fight Club lists it as pre raid BiS for humans.  Not even on the list for Orcs,  Tooth is 2nd.
---
As a human that is just entering BRD I'm envious, and I'm also currently using tooth.
---
Feels good the first few weeks, then you just see the same loot you already have over and over and OVER again.
---
I switched yesterday to a build that’s is 30/21/0
---
I heal raids/dungeons and so far have tanked a few strath runs without issue, have decent gear but nothing too special.
---
Yeah but over 3 Expansions and a shitton on Private Servers
---
How are you going to account for the 20 AP that HoJ has in addition to the proc? 
---
It's by far the best.
---
Damn, easier and better money then tribute runs? What other classes can pull this off?
---
But reading the guide it’s says I’m gonna need 650+ to get to 260-300
---
I am leveling up my mage right now. This is the final build i am aiming for but i have no idea if it's any good. I assume there is a definitely best build for frost mage but i have not found it by google.
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/230235000003--05350203000051351](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/230235000003--05350203000051351)
---
That's fair and some good points. Guess my experience IS mostly with ret pallys and a few balance druids at lower levels. SP bring decent utility, but yea they are always drinking! Thanks for the perspective.
---
Then run in a hyperoptimized guild, and don't bring any druids, warlocks, priests, hunters or rogues - druids and priests can stand outside the raid and buff you prior. Warriors, magi and shaman (resto of course, no disgusting hybrids in my speed clear) and paladins (again, obviously holy), and spend hundreds of gold per raid and a few hours sorting world buffs. Flasks are mandatory.
---
Luckily, classic is popular and lenient enough that there are guilds for all kinds of players. But don't force casual or even semi-hardcore guilds to use hundreds of gold or spec precisely to your liking.
---
Went skinning/tailoring on my warlock. Went skinning to make some extra gold while leveling. When I hit 60, what would be a good profession to replace skinning? Engineering, enchanting?
---
My guild has been together for 4 years and cleared naxx on multiple private servers.  Only about 10 former rank 14s though.
---
I know gnomes are ugly, but the racial is definitely OP for a warrior. Being either snared or slowed and then kited is a warriors weakness, a gnome can counter this, other racials have barely any impact for a warrior in PvP.
---
Slow mainhand (2.6+ preferably) and fast offhand (1.8 or faster).
---
Damn crazy to think of people doing this run 100s of times. I got mine my very 1st run.
---
Subreddit complains about Dire Maul coming too early, but already upvoting TBC memes.
---
Yes yes.
---
They are over represented because they are also one of the very best classes. Thus, you can easily afford to bring a much higher percentage of Mages to your group and do great!
---
The real question you should be asking is "are Mages having a hard time getting loot" because it does get dicey with so much competition :)
---
And people can use a plethora of things to recover their mana to stay in the fight. Especially when the fights are as short as they are in MC.
---
Mana pots, runes, nights dragon breath etc.
---
I'm struggling to decide if I hate or love that facial hair
---
So a group already built and just "picking up" a mage? Thanks! :)
---
Shadow is mint bro.
---
&gt; you’re literally limiting your own and the enjoyment of others
---
Yes that's exactly what you are doing if you play subpar specs and group with other players.
---
Personally no, but yes there might have been someone taking nodes there
---
You are a good guy. Is it a RP server that you are on?
---
Reality is wow raiders drop out and burn out. Very few people can consistently show up just the reality of life. If you're a RL do you want to invest in someone who can put in 75% effort and get 75% efficiency or someone who has to put in 200% effort for 80% efficiency. Ferals are much quicker of burning out loathing gnomer way quicker. It absolutely doesn't take 15 mins to farm enough lol it's laughable to even suggest that. It's not even a guaranteed drop. I'm not sure why people get so defensive about this it's a non controversial statement. It also doesn't matter outside of a few hundred people who give a shit about world first/top parses the most valuable class for your raid is the dude who shows up on time with semi decent gear, looked up their rotation/BIS online, and actually fucking showed up on time to raid and has consumables and doesn't start drama.
---
Hey you probably already decided but I play Allliance on morgraine, it’s a really nice server. Almost only ever see English in chat, though there are a few danish and Swedish guilds, however they all speak English in chat anyway. I think it’s a pretty even A/H split, maybe 5% more horde. Also we had world first level 60 on our server
---
Good job than.  Impressive.
---
...??? Neutral with factions other than unferciy. What are you talking about.
---
I have no idea, but more than 100 players in an area (I.e. orgirmar or IF with a single hostile raid attacking it) will bring the server to a crawl and be unplayable.
---
This raid the alliance on sulfuras organized was at least 120 people strong and running around it would just refuse to load other people or NPCs, never mind actually being able to cast spells or attack. 
---
Once the alliance were inside thralls room (I.e. by just walking through the back door and through the lag), there was no way to prevent them from eventually killing thrall.
---
Cool. Thats a funny name man, but if i see a single frost bolt or blizzard from you youre getting the kick.
---
I'm still level 58 so no raiding is not my primary focus. I want to be able to raid without being a joke or feeling like I'm being carried. I've not focused on gold as much as I should have so I'm still a long way off my epic mount and so I wanna be able to farm gold effectively as well.
---
Which private server was a 100% authentic emulation of 1.12 vanilla again?
---
Yeah... getting Tidal Charme is going to be hard, theres always atleast one Mage waiting on the spot to get him... dont see myself getting it the next weeks, it also shares DR with Kidney sadly.
---
But completely moving out of Intercept Range seems like a good Idea, thanks bud
---
Oh they did? 
---
We should have a link to it here then, would solve a lot.
---
&gt; Next time, please just ctrl-z
---
I've got a macro for screenshots for this reason. CTRL+Z, then PrintScr.... *Technically* against the TOS, but seriously doubt I'm going to get a ban for using it for screenshotting.
---
Wow holy shit this thing is robust.

Yuup as much as I love Classic, no zone beats Nagrand
---
Short answer: Yes
---
Long answer: Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees
---
People who tryhard do more than average dps..
---
No worries. GL with the tauren warriors in the future bro
---
Surely you aren't this dense.
---
All I can think about is that on his screen he saluted first
---
What would "minor necromancy" mean? Just resurrect someone's finger? :D
---
I'm playing on Auberdine, the only French PvE server, i have queue time every evening (server is "full" too, so it's not empty or anything), and i need a long time to find people for dungeons, despite being a druid that can fill any of the 3 roles.
---
Yesterday i needed about 45 minutes to find a dps for Wailing Caverns. I was very surprised, since people are usually making alts by now, and dps shouldn't be in demand, like, ever.
---
I think you can as it's a boss mount but ZG don't come out before p4 IIRC
---
How come? New player here so maybe my mentality and common sense is clouding my logic.
---
Is there an engineering mount in classic? I had one in the past but can't remember if it was vanilla or wrath..
---
well it is against TOS, but with how fucking long it has been for Blizzard to get through tickets... yea they got a solid 2-5 days lead time to do what they want before a GM gets around to giving them the warning.
---
They are definitely over represented, but most groups are more than willing to run 8 or more mages due to our high damage output. It's not necessarily a bad thing until the boss dies and loot starts to get rolled off...
---
Almost like the *WAR* part in world of *WAR*craft is there to tell you about opposing factions battling each other.
---
Seems like a gray area, they say if guards can't reach, but what does it matter if there are no guards in range in the first place?
---
Nicely done
---
If you want to find out who is lying just ask them how many addons they used back in Vanilla.  If they answer more than one 50/50 they are lying.  If they answer more than 2 or 3 max they're almost definitely lying.  
---
90% of WoW players didn't know what an addon was in 2004.
---
You have it backwards, shits cheaper now because twinking isnt a big priority yet so people are almost giving items away.
---
No. There is always *some other explaination* to why these specs are underperforming. It is never the class itself. Why if you browse this sub you'll find a load of hybrid dps who all are top 5 dps in their raid. They just can't post their logs right now.
---
no I simply want to know whether to stay on Pagle or transfer my horde to windseeker.  hoping the community might have some gauge on the servers I don't.
---
Yes, and this means that maybe 10% of your weekly ingame time is spent in raids. One to two hours in MC + Ony combined where you have periodical raid damge rendering the ring useless.
---
And another 20 hours dicking around with your friends in which the ring is amazing, because in dungeons you are normally chain pulling without ever taking a break as long as you dont need a mana break. And these mana breaks become less and less as long as the gear improves.
---
My friend and I still farm SGC and HoJ, because they don't like to drop. We need exactly one mana pause from start to Angerforge. If the gear improves (like the ring) you need even less. And the entirey of the run the healer takes &gt; zero &lt; damage due to good players keeping the mobs off the healer.
---
as some one who legit killed 3 bosses in vanilla nax and farmed MC/bwl/AQ til my eyes bled raiding 4-5 days a week.
---
i forgot 90% of mechanics. its been fucking 15 years. sure there is a lot of liers out there. you seem to misunderstand that nothing you're saying required skill in 2005. raids needed 20-25 competent people, theres a reason ony has been 10 manned in 2019. rank 14 wasn't a skill or anything other than time investment it was purely how many assists/kills per hour can you get. pure and simple.
---
This is not true at all.
---
Since we're not playing TBC it's clear you just stole this meme.
---
It was laggy to cast spells...maybe a couple seconds delay but AFAIK no one crashed.
---
No, those must have been added later.
---
The last point really sold me

---
I disagree.  You go for 9% and then don't increase it purposfully until you hit the 38.8% crit cap.  Then you balance the two as you increase them both.
---
&gt;  Remember that your blessings cause aggro also, which can come in handy if attacking the boss is not an option.
---
This is one of those many non-obvious mechanics in vanilla that are not suggested by anything that you can read anywhere in-game. When you get to 60 and obtain the Greater Blessings it can be even more potent because one cast will apply the buff to everyone in your party or raid that is the same class as the target, and the threat is multiplied by however many the buff hits. It may not be much in 5-mans unless you have four of the same class along with you. But in raids where you're called on to off tank trash, and if you hit a dozen people with a blessing, it can generate a massive amount of snap threat.
---
Engineering or a gathering profession depending if you want more power or more gold.
---
Transmog is easily my favorite thing added to WoW. Spending ~~hours days~~ weeks farming gear to play dress up with my characters. I love being able to look at someone and say "Wow that guy earned his gear, it looks great." but I also love my dress up. Wish we could have both. I guess with mounts/titles it kinda works.
---
Hit doesn't become useless after yellow cap, it just becomes worse than the same item budget of the other dps stats. 
---
What do you mean by bad idea exactly? There's only a set number of items in the game and it's pretty easy to calculate what will give the largest returns, usually that isn't stacking more hit after you're at yellow cap (but it's unavoidable at this stage with NS gloves/shoulders being the only good options).
---
Use the DPS spreadsheet and stop feelycrafting.
---
Some guilds do treat them as offspec, which I think is inefficient and unfair both for the reasons you mention and because weapons are fairly rare. Its something that should be explicitly hashed out in your loot system, but imo its probably worth spending some energy convincing the officers to make it one pool.
---
Eh, I'm playing Ret Paladin with a guild that has two Rets and we do respectable damage while providing lots of additional benefits to the raid. I'm happy with it.
---
Do one uldaman clear for quests (except the power stones one that sucks) That gave me a whole level and took about an hour. I found waste wanderer area in tanaris good for early 40s along with raptors in STV around the arena. Waste wanderers helped me get my first aid up fast and the raptors we're good money with skinning and vendoring the skins. 
---
Once you're around level 45 start trying to do ZF runs. It's great experience and can take you til high enough for maraudon. ZF is like the best point of dungeons becoming a good grind all the way to 60. ZF-&gt;maraudon-&gt;ST-&gt;BRD-&gt;LBRS
---
Engineering if you want to PvP and enchanting only if you want to disenchant BOPs.
---
Thanks for your reply anyways! I did choose mograine but I am horde :) so far a really really nice sever with a lot of active people!
---
We’re stuck in one of those hellish percentage increase decrease traps.
---
likely herbalism. Tailoring could also be dropped for alchemy. Aside of warlock BoP robe other tailors can make other gear for you.
---
Enchanting on a late to 60 toon doesn't have any benefits and will be just total gold sink. Engineering - if you want to min/max pvp, try to rank up hard. Then pair it with mining.
---
Like every class once they are max geared
---
Well "free"... at the cost of leveling tailoring or at the cost of sticking with tailoring and not having a more profitable profession.
---
sorry, was just talking about the average Reddit poster / complaining.
---
Are you going to use it?  Is it better than what you have?  If so, need.  
---
Our party leader said it best when one of our party asked if they could need on an item, "Need is need."
---
Now if you are picking up for an alt or to AH, then greed it is.  
---
Thats my $0.02.
---
Yeh I agree they want the group to decide how to do it. But the system they provide it’s quite obviously meant to be ‘need stuff u will use, greed stuff to sell’.  That’s what I remember it being back in the day too but I was casual AF
---
I wish hunters didn’t exist.  There are no “but”s.
---
[you cant look at this and not think "Cool"](https://i.imgur.com/xKqGgt5.png)
---
Worse is I think my apt makes the southpark guy seem like a casual
---
Are Warlock/Spriest actually noticeably weaker on the Alliance because of the Undead racial? Or are more people rolling Orc this time around?
---
Any horde east coast raid guilds? Or Fri/sat 4pm ST?
---
Remember that most warriors are decked in like 50% leather gear
---
I bemoans you're thinking of Kefka, the noted German novelist and clown enthusiast.
---
One in un goro, one in winterspring, one in silithus, and one in burning steppes.
---
I mean I never did Naxx in Vanilla but did loads of MC and it still took me seeing everything again to remember a lot of stuff. 15 years is a long time even for people that did raid in Vanilla.
---
Ahh someone plays horde on sulfuras?
---
You will have a harder time against UDs than other races, yes. Just as Horde Rogues will have a harder time getting a jump on you as HU warlock or in a RvR vs HU/NE and Horde Frost mages will have a harder time locking down Gnomes. That is to say, you can make cases for why Class X Race Y has a better chance versus Class A and Race B all across the board.
---
seriously. stop going to wowhead for your bis list.
---
briarwood reed, DM book, second wind...
---
mindtap talisman aren't even close to pre-bis.
---
Eh the guy that made pact with old golds ,made Orgrimmar  evil fortress and worst of all killed pandas ??
---
Anyway all that retail Activision lore is bullshit and nobody cares about it,WC3 Sylvanas was bae and awesome hero .
---
Shadow Priest would like to have a word with you. After they annihilate you leaving you wondering wtf just happened.
---
It is true. Fast main hands are just categorically worse. Credit to you for playing your own way but you would do more dps with thrash.
---
You're not wrong. At 56-57 I would usually top the parse on BRD Emp runs.
---
Ah yes, I think I mixed him up with the noted Courtier and penal reform advocate.
---
Yes like I get it’s suppose to be some what difficult to farm. But running around getting one vein every 30 minutes is absolutely ridiculous
---
How is this proper PvP?  Lol *gonna cast my longest cast healing spell while a rogue sits on me* xD
---
Huh? No demons require a respec, they can all easily be soloed using their intended mechanics by any spec.
---
No, first engineer mount was the helicopter, which was tbc
---
The motor bike was wrath I think
---
There was changes done when Dire Maul released.
---
Before it was Pre-raid bis without DM and now it includes items from DM in the pre-raid bis list on wowhead...
---
You can absolutely kill him with 40 ferals, shadows and retris. I mean, if you can find that many, certainly. It's not that hard of a fight.
---
If you are deep in holy, you aren't winning 1v1 pvp. You can waste a lot of someone's time, but you won't win a fight unless they are absolutely terrible.
---
Ret for Seal of Command burst damage and prot for Reckoning is going to be your best spec for 1v1 pvp against a majority of the playing field. But reckoning is pretty weak in PVE outside of tanking so your solo grind will be pretty weak compared to a mostly streight up ret spec.
---
So you’re doing shit dps till the end Feelsbadman
---
"Tharal" sitting there in the background wondering if he can keep the mask on and maybe take Thrall's place.
---
Will work for leveling warlocks but a prepared one with felhunter not likely. Even worse if the lock has the felheart bonus which makes the felhunter almost able to solo mages
---
Its basically the same, except you go 15/31/5 and spam backstab instead of ss. Youll be worse on fights with aoe or target switching, but fine on rag.
---
You're asking people to have a mind of their own in an echo chamber of copy pasta'd opinions and meme material. A younger generation coming in for the first time and taking old material and just vomiting it everywhere b.c some guy got 1000 updoots so it must be true!
---
Some of us are living the dream. Some of us are full of shit.
---
They can eat food above their level.
---
It's a noticeable drawback currently, especially for priests, because there are no pvp trinkets so undeads are the only ones that can mess up your only reliable CC. But once trinkets are out it evens out the playing field a lot.
---
I was introduced in 2005 and had addons immediately. What a shit argument.
---
With the exception of Daisy pants - rest is almost the same :)
---
You dont need a prot warrior for 4th OT though. Infact, none of the offtanks need to be prot.
---
Yeah! a PUG is usually a group of randoms though, instead of like a party full of guildmates or friends.
---
So it's possible that no one in the party no each other previously and there's a higher chance of things going array, like people dropping party or not understanding dungeon mechanics. It's not necessarily bad, it's just a way of letting people know the dynamics of the party before joining
---
This is absolutely the case. Maybe for those two particular instances (since there's not much rogue/warrior loot in either) casters are in excess, but if you ever want to run UBRS, Scholo, UD strat or BRD you'll get a billion tells from a billion rogues.
---
Reroll a healer then because any half decent ele does more dps than rogues single target dps. While ele has nova totem burst dps, totem boosting group dps and chain lightning with shocks. You must be a total noob.
---
Just because you and the people you played with were oblivious to addons doesnt mean everyone was.  Coming from older MMOs that restricted you to stock UIs to WoW was like a godsend.  Everyone I know went crazy with the newfound freedom of addons.  I assure you they were much more common than what you are claiming.
---
It'd work for most bosses, but there are a few with a class check. If you're willing to bend it a bit to include one or two others, it'd be pretty cool though.
---
Mages that grind ZF, I've realised that wearing high int/stam gear is way better than BiS, are there any dungeon sets that are worth getting for ZF?
---
Also, do you vendor greens or disenchant them for AH?
---
This I'm wondering about, is there real a difference in jump height?
---
Thanks. Didn’t realize that spell dmg can boost judgements
---
&gt;reached r14 in 3 weeks
---
They cant enforce that. Not everyone knows how those demons work.
---
I cleared Naxx............in wrath. In vanilla i only did MC, BWL and the 20 mans. Planning to get it all cleared this time and i want to do it by progressing through the content, not by joining a guild that has it on farm because then i might as well just watch a youtube video.
---
Wait, that's illegal.
---
A &amp; D? No one keeps keyboard turning binds...
---
You always run out of mana as a resto shaman before the DPS, because when you play with guildies your groups look like this in a good 50% of the cases:
---
\- rogue/ warrior
---
\- warrior
---
\- resto shaman
---
Sometimes only 2 warriors and a resto. But rarely will you want to run with less than two melees when dungeon crawling, because resto shaman synergy with raidgeared warriors is *amazing*. Proper communication makes keeping aggro away from the healer childsplay. For example the bats can be a nuisane in the arena. One warrior does first WW in the first pack, 2nd warrior moves in front closer to the gate and WWs the 2nd pack. No bats aggroing the healer.
---
If you hit the 12 min cap at DM:E or BRD you simply kill more. Skip golem and go straight for the elementals. They drop essences and elemental fire which are 5g each. 
---
In DM:e kill the imps + satyrs as they drop felcloth and often guard gromsblood.
---
Fewer drinking pauses are always appreciated when doing dungeons for gold, because you keep pulling. This isnt rocket science.
---
You're still talking about the top 1% to 5% of players. 
---
Players that didn't touch AQ40 or Naxx (95%+ of the playerbase) didn't use and didn't really know about addons.  The raiding community was the only primary community that used addons even back then near the end of Vanilla.  Unless you were the cream of the crop of the raiding community you still only used a few at most.  
---
Most of the raiding community showed up and used auto-attacks on the boss to kill it.  That's why your top 5 or 6 raiders could out-dps the entire bottom 20 players on a raid.
---
So long as you've made it clear you are going dagger spec, that you are passing on swords and t1 gloves, they shouldn't be too upset when you roll on daggers.
---
I’m pretty sure all free transfers right now are from higher pop to lower pop servers.
---
High/full is kinda the problem. Blizzard said the population of "medium" 2019 &gt; "full" 2004. 
---
The world (veins, herbs, etc.) wasn't designed for that many people to be in it.
---
If you have that free transfer the go ahead but i dont think low pop servers have that free transfers. Only high and full ones have that i think
---
 Class colours on:
---
     /console SET chatClassColorOverride "0" 
---
And to turn them off:
---
    /console SET chatClassColorOverride "1"
---
Our guild has a feral druid that is being handed leftover healing gear for free in the event we need them to switch to resto come BWL. But as it is, as long as we're clearing MC in 1-2 nights, everyone does as they please.
---
No need to respec. Can be done with any talents
---
Looked it up. Had no idea that you could do that. Thanks for the info!

There's a ton of grey area between "not healing"  a lock and "drop my highest cost highest and throughput heal" on the lock. If you keep a HOT rolling, or drop a healing totem, or use an AOE heal now and then you're going to increase your HPS and help recover us while still keeping up good efficiency.
---
On the flipside, if you drop what you're doing and wind up a Greater Anything Heal max rank to get us to full health when Ive only tapped to half, while we're not even fighting a mob, you're just flushing your mana down the toilet.
---
Here's how I test if a priest is going to be garbage on a run. I nuke stuff down for a few pulls, not tapping between bolts like I usually do to manage mana/threat, and then I spam tap to low health once we are out of combat, again something I never nornally do.
---
If the response from the healer is a Power Word Shield (again, when OOC and not even fighting anything) followed by GHeal, I know they are brain AFK. BTW, only time you should ever shield a lock is if they pull aggro or are AOEing.
---
chuckled at the sarcasm...
---
but on a more serious note, why are people lying about being Naxx/rank 14 instead of going for the far more prestigious mythic raid / gladiator title?
---
I mean there's enough players that we can sustain two seperate but equal circlejerks.
---
Again, I understand your knowledge is surface-level at best and you looking at guides to validate what's BiS and what isn't is the only thing that makes you think you argument has value in this conversation.
---
Just drop it.
---
Only for sexist neckbeards lol. Implying that only women play hybrid or “bad” classes is stupid, tons of dudes play boomkins and subpar tank shamans and whatnot and no-one ever makes it about their gender.
---
Priest quest
---
In dungeons good sustain too. LB hits like a truck and not that mana expensive for dungeons. A single chain lightning + fire nova totem gonna do more dps than whatever the worlds best rogue can do for the next 10 sec.
---
I dont know about you guys but I rarely, if ever change my ranged weapon.
---
Yeah pretty much what I was thinking.  I'm guessing OP is trying to do content above his level, which I see all the time and it boggles my mind.  People make the game so much harder for themselves when the simple fix is to do green quests/mobs with no downtime.
---
thanks! Haven't seen it on the AH yet on blaumeux, was hoping it would drop, but hasn't yet.
---
But pulling aggro will slow things down even more. If you just want your damage done bar to be bigger then yeah go wild, if you actually wanna be efficient you wait until the tank gets enough hits before you can throw a mindbalst.
---
Got dat mojo mask now and the same witch doctors healing staff from ZF, got the mallet yesterday im havin a blast with classic, love the memes
---
Some naxx mechanics will definitely surprise you if you've never done it before WotLK.
---
I hope you get to clear all the raids this time, mate! Get that T3.
---
Spent hours on that one because my faction is so helpful that they start healing me or dotting the demon randomly
---
I try to be as upfront as possible in recruiting and let prospective new members know that a good chunk of our players have never seen most of the content, which is sort of what we are aiming for. Helping more casual players see stuff they didn't get to see.
---
That being said, there have been 15 years worth of pservers. A lot of people playing now *have* seen Naxx and it wouldn't be surprising to be in a guild full of players who know all of the encounters.
---
I was from Dreadmist, but I took free transfer to Earthshaker for various reasons. Chief among them being I didn't like the server as a whole.
---
I ran the census addon before they broke it and I recall there being ~29k Horde characters back then. Earthshaker certainly has less, but I still have no problems getting groups and I see PUG raids forming every day for MC or Onyxia.
---
I wonder what will break first, your spirit or your body.
---
tbh that mouse is incredible 
---
I can’t use those headsets though. I’ll never give up my open back headphones. Grado4lyf3
---
It's just a QOL thing.
---
It's almost like our class armor buff restores HP5 and is useless if we're sitting at 100% health.
---
You could use the time to farm gold to afford the mats instead. That's what I had to do. :(
---
Can't wait for the death squads
---
Since i took up engineering tanking bigger pulls is a lot easier, i only have Solid Dynamite at the moment but 5-6+ mob pulls are a breeze when the first thing i do is 200+ damage to all the mobs in the pull
---
Druid here. Playing one has made me even more skittish than before, and that's as someone with the ability to stealth and travel form at will. STV makes me feel like I'm alone in the Vietnam war. I fucking hate it, but it's also kind of thrilling. But I also hate it.
---
Not sure what you'll gain from my story. All I know is playing a Druid is turning me into kind of pacifist pussy, and I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.
---
My only goal in PvP rare set or Dungeon set
---
How to find groups easily in vanilla:
---
1. Be rich
---
2. Be handsome
---
3. Dont be wierd.
---
4. Be rich.
---
5. Be streamer.
---
6. Be tank.
---
I have a vape, I don't use it but I can start again to increase my gaming skill.
---
Literally had all the same mods that people are using in classic right now, in vanilla.
---
I like it.
---
(technically it's recording all the time into a round robin buffer/file and when you press the hotkey, it stores what it has the last few minutes instead of continuing to overwrite the oldest bits)
---
Oh right maths! Thanks I'll correct it right away.
---
Mankrik is the highest population horde PvE server so it's up to you. It hits short queues during peak play times now that we are down to 1 layer.
---
Awesome list
---
Until you end up as #2 on the DPS charts somehow and things get awkward.
---
Noob, I can pound your face in pvp every day and also chain heal in raids just fine 30 0 21. Learn to play. Not knowing the potential of other classes is how I roll over noobs like you in pvp.
---
&gt;  It does less damage than Carapace Spine crossbow from strat which is very easy to get
---
Sure, sure. Tell that to my 40 UD strat runs with no drop.
---
I took blackcrow from a warrior because I couldn't get carapace spine. 
---
I kept trying of course. But ended up with Rhok'delar before I ever saw a spine drop.
---
Hah thought u meant the actual dragonling
---
Now with twice as many corpse runs!
---
Paladins are healers in organized PvP. If you are going solo, you can try out ret for damage or a hybrid holy/prot spec for survivability.
---
Can you post it on here, or a link to how to make it? I had no idea you could do that.
---
Really? You've not seen anyone tell others how to play? Your server must be blessed with tolerance and love.
---
Bonebiter is better and easier to get. Dont waste time on getting WW-axe.
---
I just don't like oomkins.
---
Never said it's an in game screen shot. Was taken off my stream and cropped.
---
I love when people think they're going to be showered in epics every raid in vanilla.
---
Ret needs a lot of gear to become strong in PVP. With blues it's kind of a joke.
---
I'm confused. By aggro reset do you mean it just wipes #1on the meter or does it wipe everyone on the meter?
---
Ever since I saw that WoW of south park. I always try to eat chips, spill them on my chest while eating them and playing games. Then I just brush them off with my fingers onto the floor for fun just like the cartoon.
---
Hunters: Is it possible to make a Weakaura to show when your pet is eating, so you can see when it's done? I can't find a buff to use as a trigger and can't figure out how to trigger it from the combat log.
---
Nice. I had glowing Brightwood staff drop a few days ago, first ever Boe epic, and the 2nd rare or above for my character.
---
Warden staff sells for a shitload though.
---
I appreciate the hype! I feel like a climbed one mountain only to see another haha
---
My only comments would be to take the two points out of healing focus and put 1 into Improved Renew and 1 into Holy Nova.
---
Healing Focus is really good for pvp, but not really pve. You don't expect to be taking damage as a healer. If you have a good group with a good tank, you will never have aggro and will never need Healing Focus. Renew is your most important healing spell so having 3/3 is good and holy nova is good in situations (and fun to use for aoe damage and healing when you have mana to spare).
---
I do understand, and I don't need to look it up because I was there. 
---
Gold isn't hard to get in classic nor was it in vanilla. Repair bills were never at the point where you'd struggle for money unless you made literally no effort to make any ever.
---
I did.Even then on my server boe epics were all need lol.Yesterday same happened in my group with skullflame shield
---
That's the dream.
---
I stood and watched. Seemed like there were hundreds of you guys.
---
I have a SP too.  It's got pretty good gear (most everything that can be farmed outside raids).  It's still really weak, outside the Shadow Weaving and dispells.  It's OK, but it still feels very weak overall.
---
As I recall back in the day, Blizz had a really hard time balancing out hybrids to not be too overpowered while leveling and in PVP, but also work in raids.  They just didn't have it sorted.
---
As long as it is around 24-27% chance per run I'm happy because that means 100% chance per hour @v@!
---
The left is also post update. The first perd skin looked quite generic.
---
I play horde on dreadmist, seems pretty lively.
---
well that shouldn't be an issue since no boss was ever even touched, hence this was straight up after the reset
---
They really neutered Naxx in Wrath. It was kinda sad. Nice to see it, but they could have tuned it a bit better.
---
Wait when did they add in Tauren riding raptor?
---
Well it's mostly the same mechanics except they actually do damage :D
---
To some people, being able to use EA when FAP or other consumes are on CD is more beneficial than aesthetics.

You are probably terrible at the game anyways so I understand your choice.

Hmmmm...

Nope.

why is it not possible to get rank 11 in p2 ?
---
Why is this in r/all top controversial posts? Gz btw
---
Prot pally levelling here it's not bad, consecrate and respec at 40 for holy shield. I don't even dungeon level just grind mobs 2 to 3 levels under because you can pull 3 to 4 at a time and take advantage of your aoe.
---
As boring as some might consider personal achievement threads to be, I found this thread because I am deliberately browsing this subreddit with the controversial tab, because I'm tired of "hot" showing nothing but idiocy disguised as humor, and memes.

I hope SCARAB LORD KAINZO was salty AF he didn't get it first.

My point is that after a while you won't have to play with them, and it was the same in vanilla. Once they're geared they won't do dungeons and they will be in their own "min/max guilds", hang out in whatever discord(or Irc as we had back in the day) where they found like minded people.   
---
they will in no way bother the rest other than in BGs, where guess what: The assholes were in vanillas well.
---
It looks like a foursome to me.
---
Ninja looting would be them telling you to greed and then needing or you winning a roll with a full inventory and one of them taking it off the body.
---
I always wait on rolls in pugs to see what others do.  Though in this case you rolled need and are sour because they rolled need to potentially fund an item that they want.  If I am in a group I would at least consider giving it to someone in your circumstance, but that has to be what everyone agrees with.  They don’t know you and for all they know you are just going to be putting it on the AH within 5 minutes of finishing up.
---
This is a good raid build, especially if you’re the freshest 60 or getting into raid a little sooner as the other mages will benefit from winters chill. If you’re in the top half of the mages gearwise you should switch to an arcane power/frost build and have another mage take winters chill
---
Ye it does.
---
I remeber seeing a video shortly after classic launched that showed that bilizzard's subs trippled the month that classic released.  I have no idea how many are playing only classic now a couple months later, but some of those extra subs are probably still around.  I know me and my wife are.  She hasn't playes retail since the beginning of legion and I quit a couple months into BFA.  Neither of us even have retail installed anymore.
---
I been trying to kind of ignore them, but.. I like everyone at max health.. its hard to see
---
"Macro" as in keyboard/mouse macro not WoW macro.
---
It's under 1.C. And they've liberally applied this in the past to botters and people who use keyboard macros to automate gameplay.

So the Lieutenant Commander's 2 piece set is more spellpower so I only see myself going for that. I'm going to be looking to get boots and shoulder from that and then also have 3 pieces of arcanist for my ideal PvP set. I don't think it's worth dropping all that spellpower, resistances, and other stats from the raid gear for the 1.5s shorter blink cooldown.
---
Yeah i havent gone into shadow much but it adds like 15 damage to my Pain dot spell so i like it, also had better stars than the chapeau and looks cool so it was like sweeeet
---
From personal experience its rarely the case that my undead racial was the reason I win a PvP fight. Speaking for spriests you’re going to be an absolute terror irrespective of race. In a fair PvP scenario you’re likely to come on top in most scenarios because of your class utilities like Silence, mana burn, mind flay, fear, PW:S etc.
---
what server you on?
---
Thought I recognized the guild name yeah :p
---
Why people stream with their messy unkempt bed and room as a backdrop is beyond me.  No one wants to look at that.
---
what professions do you have? paladins benefit greatly from engineering, grenades add damage and an extra stun for example
---
is your gear good for your level? is your weapon lvl appropriate? did you choose the right stats on your gear? str and stam for ret are the most important
---
Hold up, isn't Honored to Revered 12,000 and Revered to Exalted 36,000?
---
I’m not sure... very strange. Maybe I will discover my first Gold !
---
Fuckin horde needs to organize a bit more. Feels like there are more of us but you bastard alliance are just more organized.
---
Dungeon xp is really good in classic, but the play experience can be quite repetitive. It is a great way of getting some hands on experience with tanking as well! And yes, getting groups is a lot easier as a tank!
---
Definitely word art rephrasing the highlighted content as well for clarity
---
Is this based on any empirical fact or did you just feel the need to add your 2 cents?
---
Blizzard has not published subscription numbers in years.
---
If you say "give me 100g or I'll heal you" it is very actionable, as you've just documented your understanding of how it works.
---
&gt; a lot of people talk about "Vanilla", when their first max level character might actually have been in TBC
---
That seems like a pretty big mistake to make. Maybe if they never got past the leveling phase, but there's no way they could forget which raids they progressed through.
---
One does not simply enter Stratholme.
---
Same mechanics were there, but a bunch got removed when naxx made its second debut.
---
No changes to vanilla. Not no changes to wow classic
---
yeah I'm such a noob that I smoke every shaman roleplaying as a dps class. really high iq comment there pal
---
I have spent hours searching on google to find this fix lol I can’t find anything, every time someone asks about it people just reply with “go back to retail!!! This is how a gun should sound!”
---
Are you looking for people to write columns?  I might be interested.
---
You need to be farther than 5yrds away from ur tank if u want to avoid the chaincleave. Check your positioning as many future bosses will also have this chaincleave (even tho bosses are much bigger so being 5yards away from the tank isn't that hard on most of them)
---
I was under the impression that hybrid classes were invited to raids for their buffs, not damage.
---
I was lucky enough to do the exact same thing when it was still possible purely by accident. The pet ran at me and got trapped, kited her away and she barely did anything with proper stinging - easiest of the 4 demons!
---
ah, good call, thanks!
---
Show up more often in such threads and you will see. Insults and flaming happen a lot if you don't worship the war fury/sword rogue gods.
---
I remember doing AQ4 with about 20-30 people in Wotlk. Cthun wiped the floor with us. It was not even a fight. Half the people couldnte

 Even get to see him.
---
Thrall is creamin' his pants in the afterlife.
---
you sure it isn't Alt+z?
---
*Mostly.* It's also a bit of a joke, since some mechanics were completely ignored in wrath so you wonder why they even kept them.
---
To me the problem isn't the hybrids, it's the people getting mad over losing loot to a hybrid. It seems in raids people are very short sighted and get really upset when they lose an item to a "meme" spec forgetting that we will be clearing Molten Chore and Onyxia until the end of Classic. There is no rush, you will eventually get your items. 
---
Let the paladins have their fun until they become nightfall slaves.
---
I farmed the essences.  I got all my essence of fires doing BRD runs for BIS stuff.  I started doing earth and air elementals in Silithus at level 57 after I picked up the Hydraxian Waterlords quest.  Grinding them got me rep for Molten Core at the same time, plus about 300k xp before I got all the essence I needed.  The water essence was the fastest, as I got lucky and had no competition for a couple hours in Felwood.
---
If I had been level 60 I probably would have farmed the gold instead, but I got levels and rep from the grind.
---
You can clear MC fine with a 25 man raid in shit gear so you might aswell carry a few meme specs through the raid. You could probably even clear it with nothing but meme specs if you wanted to.
---
That being said, Boomkins and Rets aren't bad in a "they do 50 less dps" way. They do only a fraction (at least 50% less) of the damage of a normal dps. People arent shitting on those builds for being slighlty worse but rather for 3 meme players being worth 1 real player. If thats your jam then go and have fun... the content allows it.
---
Yes!
---
I've been using it since level 35 and it's going quite well. Kill much faster than command with a weapon swing add-on for enemies.
---
Those are just objectively bad players. You get the same derpy behaviour from pure dps classes too.
---
Server crashes die to IF population during creating.  Relog to message "Item not found"
---
Thanks best me to it. There are people who control more obvious subreddit names but weren’t willing to share them so this is the main one
---
&gt; you sure it isn't Alt+z?
---
Yeah probably. I'm at work so I just assumed the guy above me had the right key combo.
---
Always just scrapped'em when I got a new desk lol
---
Does it work as druid too ? Not sure how important rogue's improved stealth is in here.
---
Buy items like Dreamweave and Red/Black Mageweave on AH and possibly 'of Nature's Wrath'-gear where you can find something cheap.
---
Going Ele is a lot about boosting your damage output and killing enemies before they even reach you.
---
I respec'ed from Enh to Ele at 40 with no gear really saved up except a small "healing set" that had some int/spi. Bought those items on AH for a total of 30g and have since grinded to 55 right now - faster than I have ever leveled a Shaman in Vanilla on a pserver before. Also find it a lot more enjoyable. :)
---
Some great tips there mate, thanks for filling in the details! :-)
---
People are dicks a lot of times.. theres a lot of dumb people in the game, they dont give buffs for instances, they dont give mage water or food, tanks charge in to the next pull in SM when I have like 100 mana left and I JUST sat down to drink..
---
Had a couple of people leaving the guild because of this :D
---
Like it's the guilds fault.
---
5-7 days? Geez I must be more inefficient than I thought lol, I’m already 7 days in at level 48 on my rogue. Looking like it’s gonna take me 10+ days played to hit 60 at this rate.
---
Well, I'm good enough at the game to know that I simply wouldn't play not being a tauren. Simple as that.
---
Implying you can't tank with a 2H or 2 1H setup.
---
Question regarding Raiding:
---
From my understanding (new to WoW), the lockouts make it so that you can only run Molten Core once per week and Onyxia once per 5 days, so when would the best time be to sign on and look for PUGs? And also, once I run the Raid, can I not join other PUG's to run again until 5 or 7 days later? (is the lockout personal or guild-driven?)
---
I just hit 60, have most of my pre-raid BiS, and my guild is still a few weeks / months away from running a Raid, but I am super excited to try raiding as its the main reason I started playing. 
---
I am also not locked into my guild, so if anyone needs heals I am a Pally Healer on Alliance &lt;Westfall&gt;.
---
You’re damn right, my ass looks as good as a ham!
---
Or maybe three hams...
---
This right here, making your own Group is usually the fastest way
---
You are flat-out going to have a difficult time against any ranged DPS no matter how you are specced - that's just class balance at work.  For PvP you need to ensure you are using your stun on cooldown and playing the fight for the long game.  A paladin's best friend in PvP is the other character's exhaustion.
---
Some things that get overlooked for paladin PvP are timely use of Hand of Freedom to avoid traps/slowdown, "jousting" when using a slow two hander to make sure you are using the right spacing for your swing timer (especially against quick-hitting melee), and appropriate use of cleanse, which can be cast while moving.
---
Many guides advise taking up engineering to close a lot of the range gaps in paladin PvP and those really help as long as you maintain the right consumables.
---
ah damn thats pretty niche, guess i was wrong, it displays your healing done, not healing done over target, my bad  
---
but it's still pretty good and worth to use!
---
IIRC, the one with most honor a given week gets the most advancement in rank. So if you get 1st each week you should still be able to reach rank 11 or 14. That’ll take several weeks (months?) due to honor decay.
---
This is just false. I played in late vanilla, definitely had multiple add-ons while only raiding MC/ZG/ONY
---
You seem pretty intense for a stoner dude, dude!
---
Always sell pre-60 BoE epics if it can fetch you a lot of gold because they won't do you any good for end game. They'll make your leveling process easier, true, but if you can get 100-200g out of them the gold will be much more useful.
---
If you want to raid, you need the frost channeling.  Drop improved cone of cold instead.
---
"I will never die"
---
3 bosses, I’d say Anubrekan, razuvious and either Noth or faerlina!
---
Am I correct?
---
More that I know they can farm well but I feel that style would be so mind numbing that I dont think its worth it for me personally
---
Any mage named anything related to fire or ice is low hanging fruit.
---
lol. 
---
20g easy on my realm, for the ore.
---
Looks a lot like the way I have my TukUI set up.  Just a couple minor differences whatever it is.  I can't tell you what exactly he is using though, just that ELV and TUK can get pretty similar to this.
---
Right? Even boomkin gets alot better with zg/aq stuff where the Mana pools get bigger and spell hit becomes more available.
---
Not ‘would even’ - should*
---
2 of Them is BiS for pvp.
---
I watched the vid and figured it out. If your pet gets damage on either of the bosses the mechanic is much like before. If you were doing a pure proximity pull like OP however (pet disappears before even getting damage off) you are gonna see the two stick together.
---
I don't know - being in a WAR over CRAFTing materials seems crazy
---
He didn't really make a pact. He tried, and mostly succeeded, to bend an old god artifact to his will.
---
And that right there is why you don’t neglect hybrid dps players.
---
Having said that though, going with an underlevelled healer and 2h tank was pretty much asking for trouble lol.
---
...
---
of course, timmy. of course.
---
haha this happened to me 3x yesterday.  Even once at 6:30 AM when I woke up super early for the reason of having an empty zone.  Curse you friendly alliance that dont know :)
---
I feel like I saw this meme yesterday on here and you just added sm gear and fucked up the "let me out" instead of let me in but ok
---
*Fresh meat!*
---
Damn I feel your pain. I haven't killed Anger as much as your that's fro sure. I am probably int he 40-50 range but have also yet to see it. Pisses me off though thinking of people like you grinding for it and not seeing it or getting it and then some low level noobs get it right away.
---
RNG really starting to piss me off lol. Some of the newest players to hit 60 and a lot are more casual than people who been 60 for awhile been winning all the gear in our raids. Gets annoying lol.
---
It defenitely works for druids too.
---
I used to farm there a bit at Level 37&amp;38.
---
I got some nice loot from the rares. Made some Gold from the chests inside and killing the ghosts + endboss.
---
There is Videos on this on YouTube as well. 
---
it is more efficient on a rogue simply because you have pickpocketing which generates a good bit of the Money you can make. 
---
Was fun though and a nice and easy way to get some better gear :P
---
It's 15 minutes now. I was pretty disheartened to hear that I would be waiting a 2+ hour respawn after I saw another hunter kill one in front of me, but thankfully it's much much shorter now.

Just because they've actively avoided wiggling *your* joystick it doesn't mean they're bad at it.

15 days played, have 150 gold. Leveled alchemy off the AH since I don't like gathering. Learned all my skills, maxed all secondary professions. Bought some rare recipes off the AH. Got everything I wanted now I slowly accumulate Gold. I mainly dungeon run / raid log,  transmute CD for the main tank. I fish a lot of Nightfins. Still feel OK where I am at now.
---
 80% of my playtime nowadays is standing still or in an instance where I can't use mounts.
---
Phase 3 when you want an Epic Mount. Plenty of time for that.
---
tukui, takes some setting up though. think its also known as elvui?
---
Use the kill order markers on each other. My wife &amp; I have the same issue.
---
I still used mine as a healer weapon until I got the mallet and shield from SM cath, it can still be relevant for a bit.
---
Give yourself a raid market. Preferably the orange nipple.
---
Thanks, i'll look into it for later, level 20 atm :P
---
&gt; So you are telling me what i was thinking and writing?
---
I can see what you wrote, this isn't a grand assumption. You were the one who speculated about what I was saying. My argument was about kicking random players from groups NOT mages charging for water. This isn't a discussion because you never nailed down the topic correctly.
---
Rank 14 itself takes like 3 months of 18 hours a day straight, no breaks. 
---
So 11 will be like 2 months I would say.
---
I'm sure there's an add-on to help with that but I'm not using any atm. You can always place raid targets over yourselves. Right click portrait and select star/moon/etc.
---
We do that but it’s annoying running around with a star over my head all the damn time.
---
I think they were friends, and honestly the 2h tank was way smoother than i would have expected (but he was lvl 46).  I offered to tank, but was very up front about not having tanked in classic yet and not being 100% sure i knew my way through Uldaman yet.  I also obviously dont have dungeon gear, so i think he just went tank because he was going to rip threat off of me anyways.
---
how much it cost you? I need a trinket lol and I am giving up on HoJ
---
IMO this is the best route to go. Get the thorium nodes and vendor the junk from killing  to buy more thorium.
---
Noth. 
---
i also did do this. but turns out our naxx raid was on a day i typically worked. i only made it into one of our guilds naxx raids. i had to work my grocery store hussle in highschool.
---
[Check this addon](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/vanilla-gun-sounds), just reverse your process, take gun sounds from retail into the classic one. Should work
---
Elvui may have the options you are looking for, but I'm not sure.
---
Any reason you can't just put a raid marker over your head and say "Follow the star."?
---
You can still just as easily kite the pet. With Cheetah on she will never catch up to you. Sustaining mana is the hardest part now.
---
no competition, just make sure your runs take longer than 12 minutes.
---
It's worse at least the guy in Southpark bothered to move to the living room!
---
Okay ngl that looks pretty cool. I like when WoW embraces it's cartoonish nature, not everything has to be edgy and cool, some things are just sorta fun.
---
Thats in tbc.
---
Have a good amount of prebis but still also using thrash blade/mirah song
---
Okay...hang on though.  There is a difference between disrespect to hybrids and disrespect to *meme specs*. 
---
No one says resto druids or paladins are bad, most people seem to realize that feral tanks are pretty good, no one hates on shamans in the right roles.
---
Where you're going to get laughed at is when you try to run a meme spec in endgame content...boomkin, ret paladin, shammy tank are all just laughable.
---
Shammys, paladins, druids....no one dislikes us, they just dislike when we don't have the self awareness to run real specs.
---
Oh perfect, thanks!
---
It's usually a tryhard thing. Folks who want to be top dog, but haven't done the research or work themselves, spouting things they saw on youtube. 
---
If someone's going on too much about his DPS being the greatest because of his cloned spec, you're honestly probably better off without him.
---
It's Loatheb.
---
I'd argue that phase 2 is gonna be pretty important to have an epic mount, if you're planning on wPvPing at all.
---
Check this place on raid night mate you'll be walking on a road of corpses
---
Ey, does anyone know how much int is required to gain 1% spellcrit for mages?
---
This is just completely untrue. Everyone used add-ons. Rpers even had a ton of add-ons for them. If you did organized pvp you used add-ons. I was not a hardcore raider, only did up to MC/ZG/ONy and every healer had crt monitor, decursive, threat meters etc.
---
I mean, it's pre-raid BiS in pve.  The BRD princess quest ring is pretty close, but Freezing Band or Maiden's Circle are your only other options, and they're both super expensive.
---
I don’t see anything in elvui. That’s the work around we are using.
---
As a mage that makes the switch every week to be in arcane frost for raid night, it is definitly kind of upsetting when other mages in my raid do not. Aside from the one mage with winter's chill, ideally you want everyone in arcane frost. It's not that the raid can't be done with subpar specs on half your mages, but arcane frost is going to be about 30% more damage than deep frost so it's always nice for people to be in the right spec. It's just kind of the mentality that if I'm shelling out the gold to make sure I can do the most damage so we clear quickly, then why shouldn't the other people I'm competing with for loot have to do the same.
---
As the other comments below this have said, feral druids with MCP dwarf warrior threat. Yes, it's a consumable, but any druid tank knows they need to farm these. I can tell you from experience that with a single pummeler charge, nobody is even kind of close to me on threat in a boss fight.
---
I agree. It’s so weird how people are so thin skinned that this shit bothers them.
---
Tauren I can get on board with. I will truly, truly, truly never understand the people who roll Human though. They are either minmaxing for PVE, or just complete brainlets.
---
&gt;Not everyone needs to min max with full consumables to preform well and do sub 2 hour Onyxia/MC clears
---
2 hour MC is on the slower end.
---
min/max'er are in the 30-40 min range now.
---
I have a feeling the rest of your rant devolve from this: you don't even know what's good.
---
however, there's definately a supply of bad guild willing to take bad meme players and enjoy the ride while their 10-man core carry them... the true classic MC experience.
---
Tier 6 vs entry level 5 man heroic. Of course.
---
My fault then! Take my upvote as apology
---
Save it imo. It's great for PvP and harder raids like Naxx and AQ.
---
Are you turning while feigning, because spell batching means the CD will go off and often reset aggro but the combat tick cannot
---
Not really.  A well played, tryhard ret paladin should be in the bottom third easily, but somewhat above the tank.  The only people you should be beating are other meme specs or people that have bad gear and are bad at the game.
---
What enhancement should I look for on my 2h weapon? (Level 40 warrior, arms, whirlwind ax)
---
Im sorry but your approach is super negative. Why? I asked for civil friendly discussion.
---
Lock-outs are for individual characters.  So if you kill Onyxia, you have to wait 5 days for the reset, same deal with MC - if you kill any bosses you are saved to that instance.
---
Definitely try to get into some PUGs, I know theres an MC on my server that is 5/10 through MC with just PUG players every week.  I pugged an Onyxia last night and got my first kill of her in 12 years.
---
I'd hold onto it for now. It will probably go up in cost once the honor system is released. If you get to 40 and need gold for your mount you can sell some then. You don't really need it for leveling. Handy for leveling cooking though.
---
Living essence is less than 2 gold on my server and essence of earth is 10-12g. Are you telling me 10g for a transmute is not good?
---
I see people on my server buying arcanite transmutes for 5 gold generally maybe a little more if they're desperate. I am not a miner so its not like I can get my own bars and crystals. My undeath to water is an easy 8-9g as well and even more if I utilize the mats for tailoring.
---
10g &gt; 5g
---
Most guilds raid on reset night aka Tuesdays.
---
Due to a scheduling kerfluffle we had only 1 guildie warlock show up in MC last night for Majordomo &amp; Rag instead of the 3 we had on Tuesday. Meanwhile the 8 mages who came along saw a grand total of 1 piece of mage gear drop this week while the warlock got 2 pieces of epic gear in one night. Quite a few guildies made warlock alts after the run.
---
The 'community' you're talking about tends to be the first-to-60 types of people. Such people are online enough and small enough in number that they come to recognize one another.
---
As you start increasing the number of people - and decreasing the hours they're online - it's not the same sort of community.
---
Think of the difference between the office of people you work with all day long and the people you see on the subway on your way to work. The former is a relatively tight-knit group. The latter is not.
---
I was talking about waiting broken tooth spawn is just wasting your time since every cat in thousand needles has 1.2 attack speed. Tamed broken tooth and saw the difference.
---
Still annoyed that Blessing of Kings isn't at the bottom of the Ret tree. At least then they would potentially get 1 spot per raid, similar to shadow priests.
---
if you truly cant stand looking at a gnome, then level fishing and cooking and make deviate delights. Just dedicate one whole bag for carrying deviate delights.
---
Nah don't delete them. Because then that's just completely wasted time. And besides, think of all the wonderful rested XP all your alts are getting. I've got 4 Ally characters and 2 Horde. I just alternate between playing them when they have a couple levels worth of resting. The only bad thing is all of them are falling behind the curve a bit. Getting harder to find players my level who wanna run dungeons. Oh well.
---
Sure...but not on meme specs.
---
Heck, feral dps is borderline meme spec and has to both tryhard *and* use MCP liberally to be above average on dps if your raid is semi-competent.
---
Fish market, obviously no. But if they had a food merchant.
---
Since classic launched, I've only been playing what some consider as "meme" or "non-meta" specs/classes.
---
I have a Prot Paladin, Boomkin and Shadow Priest. Its great fun and I LOVE ITT. Trying to show people that it doesn't matter and I can still be useful AF.
---
Loatheb
---
Is it possible people forgot shit 15 later? And just having fun not trying too hard?
---
I was a serious-casual player.  I was in one of the elite guilds back in the day  (we opened the AQ gates)  but 'elite' back then was still pretty casual. Almost everybody in our guild had normal 9 to 5 jobs or were students with daily activities outside the game.   We barely used  Flasks or world buffs.  We actually had problems clearing BWL in 5 hours for the Scepter quest (Vaelastrasz - Nef) and only managed it after failing 2 weeks.   But we did use a lot of addons.  
---
I have no idea why you insist that more casual players would not know about addons.  It wasn't the dark ages... we had great forums, Blizzard forums were still nice and useful,  almost every guild had a guild website, we had voice communication, we had IRC, we had MSN , we had Thottbot , information got spread.
---
I grinded 47-48 on my alt because quests for my level were drying up, and I was getting a fairly consistent 30k/hr.  I'd definitely look for some humanoids with lower armor/health
---
Well most of your damage is autoattacks anyway. There are good plate items also. Id only take the leather pieces if I was lacking hit.
---
They're going to be a minute long for like a year, minimum. They're going to a minute long when that cenarion gear has been banked for months and months.
---
Blame blizzard for the crappy itemization my dude.  If I had the ability to be competitive wearing only Plate I’d be more than happy to wear only Plate, but, unfortunately that just is not the case in classic. 
---
I don’t reserve anything in my runs though and I always try to bring another melee to give them a chance.
---
I thank you all soo far for the comments :) im glad for your output
---
our guilds super well geared fury warrior hits 500 in most fights. I didn't realize the average is lower unless you are looking at total damage done in mc?
---
Is anyone else struggling to find groups for 5-mans as a healer? I'm a Holy Paladin and people are falling over themselves to invite me to raids, but finding a group for pretty much any instance with my prebis in is like pulling teeth.
---
I mean, most things are only "best" by small amounts.  Green lens vs Crimson Felt Hat is 4-6 spell power.  Hands of Power vs Earth Warden's Gloves is 4 spell power and a little Int.  Drakestone vs Spirit of Aquementas is 7 spell damage.  Add those little differences up, and the difference is 17 spell power, which is equivalent of another entire item.
---
Night Elf shadow priest?
---
As I’m 58 now and bit the bullet to go deep prot I’m seeing a LOT of example C. This or that on reserve. Just fucking roll on it like a normal person ffs.
---
I also agree with B. “Spellcleave”, “Speed Runs”... I mean please. 
---
I may as well touch on A. There’s not a single rogue I’ve ever grouped with (been arms or fury tanking) who’s had improved sap and it makes me sad. 
---
Hunters just end up pulling with badly timed multi shots. And their CC is so short it’s not even worth it. 
---
But my problem has been healers, man. Maybe I need to group with a holy pally?
---
Not effective at all, unless you level a dps and get heal boosted. Otherwise your xp gets split, in and out of group.
---
+weapon damage or fiery, isnt worth it for Crusader at this point.
---

---
I had several red names spamming /cheer yesterday when I got a kill. This is a situation where pvp or pve doesn’t really change if you can be griefed or not.
---
Maybe because I’ve done it some time’s before and have something to compare it with. Most I’ve talked to all agree that it’s easier then it used to be.
---
&gt; battle rezzes someone; and,
---
&gt; innervates a healer. 
---
These are both nice but once you have boss fight execution down (should not take more than a couple kills, max) you will never need either of them again.
---
My Mage is named Incendia and I get a lot of compliments on it :(
---
I would love to see what they could do with a classic+ idea. If they took the scrapped concepts and reworked them into the game. But I think it would only work if by some miracle they got the original team to finish it.
---
59.5 is the exact number, private realms used a base of 60. my advice is worry about getting "hit capped", then stack +sp dmg and +sp crit, as the int will be tertiary stats on almost every item.   
---

Can we let this fan fiction die already.

There is no such thing as classic + or any plans for it.

Even if there was it would be dog shit like bra.
---
We Activision now.
---
Dear HOTW druids. We love you - and we have a few questions.
---
I find that as a resto druid - going oom is a very real thing. I am assigned as a tank healer for the Rag fight, and expected to keep my hots up on the main tank at all times(the healer officer is watching hot uptime).
---
So I keep Rejuvenation and rank 4 Regrowth on the main tank(who happens to be a bear druid), and am already ready with Rank 4 Healing Touch(cancelling the cast if my Priest partner has already topped off the tank). And when he calls for an Innervate, he gets it.
---
My mana reserves do not last anywhere near as long as the priest. There is no comparison, at all. I have to pop a mana potion as well as the felwood cleansing item thing, *and* my trinket in order to last through the Ragnaros fight. And by phase 2 it's definitely happened where I've been totally OOM and precious seconds away before my potion cooldown is back up. My gear is comprised of all dungeon blues from each of the various 5-mans/UBRS, some of which are BiS. My fire resistance is 80 unbuffed.
---
My question is, how are you guys doing it? I would love to just stay with HOTW spec but that 20% increased intelligence probably does not match up against moonglow/resto mana savings or efficiency. And full resto + swiftmend...I'm not totally sure that swiftmend is as big a deal. It's getting expensive to respec away from HOTW to one of these more dedicated healing specs, *then spec back* to HOTW for non-raiding days.
---
I've tried both the moonglow spec as well as the full resto spec. While the moonglow spec definitely seems to be easier on my mana, the danger of going oom is very real.
---
Its only impressive in the sense that the whole raid seems to be doing pretty well. The average MC pug will rarely have any player above 500 dps, although they are all doing AOE dmg. The feral druid is still only doing less than half as the other top meeles and is probably only in the raid for the aura.
---
The only reason the druid is above the 3 meeles below is that the druid also dropped a goblin sapper charge hitting multiple targets. 
---
All that being said i dont really mind ferals anyways, especially if they offtank for some encounters and buff other meeles they are a welcome addition to the raid. Boomkins on the other hand are the real meme spec.
---
Did you farm these yourself?
---
I feel like you're hating on his fun rather than defending your own.
---
There's nothing wrong with a super hardcore guild. And if they're acknowledged as the best because they optimize their specs, they invest in their consumables, and they do it faster, and more consistently, than builds that allow specs that aren't the optimal spec. I'm in a seven person guild right now with a balance druid as one of the members, so I get it. But if you aren't willing to acknowledge that a Ret pally or an Enh shaman or a balance druid is just worse than bringing an optimal specced char, then you're not understanding why those other specs are optimal.
---
Personally, I'd rather have fun joining up with other guilds at 5/10 that don't have enough people to do MC without help, allow whatever spec, and have fun with it than deal with speccing DS/ruin and being shit solo farming, investing all my time into raid prepping so I can commit to three raid nights a week. And I think you should play your own game. Just don't get mad at people who realize that the optimal number of warlocks in MC is 4 until you get good at Garr, and then it's 2 or 3, ret pallies and balance druids are filler, and not going to pull their weight in a well run, experienced farm clear, and that Resto shamans have Windfury, which is all Enh really does for the raid that a fury warrior or rogue doesn't.
---
Nothing in the game even compares to Escape artist on either side. It's a great PVP AND PVE ability. You can escape out of anything that slows you down.... whether it's hamstring or a PVE curse/poison/net. I even used to use it against Shadow priest mindflay casts and watch them stand around awkwardly not understanding why their cast broke. It's so strong and most people don't realize how good it really is because of how much people hated playing a gnome.
---
You must be a warlock
---
Yeah I know. You should but they are soooo expensive xD
---
But I love it when the rings procc against a rogue or warri. Mostly when a rogue opens on me and he just freezes xD Lovin it
---
real hero class
---
Casuals
---
By that you mean you were able to use keys further away than Q&amp;E because you didn't free those up by binding A&amp;D to strafe?
---
I'm a lefty too but I don't see how it's anything but a disadvantage.
---
I miss real GM players that would shut this shit done in an hour tops
---
With the fewest initial defenders!
---
Honestly, I would think so but no way to tell until you try.
---
lol yeah, I just completed my third mc/ony and I have gotten one item. But its a good one! Choker of the Fire Lord!

They specifically tried to remove this from the game already, and much of the community thinks it's one of the things that leads down the path to Massively Singleplayer Online.
---
Working to find team-mates makes you value them more.
---
Yes, but it is not worth it to store epics for P5 now. We will have hundreds upon hundreds of items to DE by P5. We can maybe start to gather some to DE on a specific DE character by P3 or P4.

As long as you have proper consumables, you can do it as the standard 20/31/0 pve build

If I'm a orc fury warrior with axe in mh and my 6% hit secured; does it matter if I have an axe or sword for off-hand? Is the hit chance still negligible because yellows will still hit with my mh and the 6%?

starts proccing a lot less at high avoidance though.

Wouldn't a casual be the one without a gaming laptop and gaming pc?

I feel so hard for you I want to hurt myself for seeing this even though I'm not even you...

Really really sorry for this. This is something I would tell me grandchildren in 20-30 years....
---
"Once I lost a roll with a draw on an item that you are literally never going to see dropping. No matter how hard you try" :3
---
I don't think people are wondering what happened. SP is pretty much a dedicated 1v1 spec we've known this for 14 years
---
And by 'literally' you, of course, mean figuratively. 
---
Or do you just not know anything about the class and are spouting whatever you've heard others say?
---
So wait, the game just fucked you over even though you both rolled 80s?
---
r/woooosh
---
It wasn't about the gear really. it was that they could actually hold threat on that whole hallway MUCH easier that a druid or warrior. It's just that they wouldn't necessarily live without the gear. That heroic was hard even when you "outgeared" it.
---
And there's no way to automate that switch that you know of?
---
Agreed, i think maybe my comment isn't as clear as I'd like.
---
My point was not that feral is bad, my point is that feral is the best of the "meme specs" and only by tryharding  can they rise above average...meaning every other meme spec is below average even with tryharding.
---
I get that the odd time but I'd say rarely. What happens more often then not is people not paying attention to patrols. I met one mage who said he would give water at the end of the instance lol which he did but I just took some and gave it to someone at the inn lol I thought it was super weird he would get asked by everyone and he would answer after we're done lol like what logic is that.
---
Oh my goodness your role playing makes me lol. Thanks for being you!
---
Why would a warrior not wear plate? Serious question from a 31 warrior...

That's rough

F's in chat.

That's a paladin.
---
SIEZE THE MEANS OF LOOT DISTRIBUTION COMRADE
---
Azuresong mageblade and the Staff drops are guaranteed 15 min breaks in the raid to decide who gets to roll
---
Yeah that's the version I went with - the issue is that as Blizz made changes to their UI, MoveAnything removed elements that became redundant in that version; so using an 8.x MoveAnything on a 1.x WoW, there are features missing.
---
If you were happy to tinker it wouldn't be hard.
---
We're talking 40% or more. That's what the logs show.
---
Imagine saying a spec's weapon is somehow a negative. Takes 15 minutes to do 5 farms, it's nowhere near as bad as people say.
---
Tryharding on Feral isn't really much different than other dps. Just make sure you have runes, mana pots, and MCPs. Aka, farm some gold and a little gnomer. Oh no, what an insane amount of effort /s
---
It'd be cool if for Classic+ they just released TBC and didn't do Classic+.
---
That's what I hope they do for Classic+
---
I ran 75 times before I ever saw it drop. I luckily reserved it on all my runs. If you do Arena/Angerforge/Golem. Casters get something from arena, other warriors get chance at SGC and healers get the trinket from golem. Also... if you have a hunter friend they can solo and kill angerforge and ML the trinket to you.
---
Interesting... I'm living here in Korea as well, though just play on a US server since that's where my account has always been. Had I known i might have tried it out....
---
Can you only use this mount if you have the fastest riding level or does it go whatever speed you currently have trained?
---
I was just thinking that last night about the camp! "I swear there was a flight path here..."
---
There's absolutely no reason to go oom when you have mp5 food, greater mana potions and demonic/dark runes.
---
I'm OK without the depth and meaning of corpseruns and waiting for quest mobs (like the hunter demons) to respawn *three hours* after each interruption, thanks.
---
Well I guess your dumbass did say you had no experience. 
---
&gt; You HAVE to finish the grind inside MC on trash mobs. You can not finish it outside MC. Period.
---
&gt; You also have to kill several bosses to complete the clicky clicky quest.
---
&gt; To get this water, you must grind to get reputation with the Hydraxian Waterlords. After you have reached honored, and after you have finished the quests earlier in this chain,  you can pick up the quest "Hands of the Enemy". You have to kill Lucifron, Gehennas, Shazzrah, and Sulferan. Once you have the hands of each of these bosses in MC, the water can be picked up.
---
Nice video ! I learned something new from it (will add atlas loot addon to my repertoire). I have one that might be good for you. It is five second timer it counts down the 5 seconds of the GCD which helps when you are trying to manage mana. 
---
Keep up the good work
---
You can't. Tauren can only ride kodo and wolves.
---
That's because mages just finished SM like 3 days ago when entering Strat.
---
I guess that's what OC is now
---
Why is playing a female character seen as a negative thing? Geniunely curious, this is my first time playing WoW and I've seen this a couple of times. Before this game I only played some local MMOs (South American) and people used characters of any sex indistinctly, no one ever cared about such a thing. So I'm surprised to see it brought out repeteadly in this game.
---
What herb is it?
---
Alright so here is the deal.  Raiding in vanilla was many, many years ago.  Yes I was in a Naxx raiding guild.  We were horde side server 2nd Ragnaros.  No we didn't kill almost everything in Naxx but our best kill was Thaddius.  I remember *literally* nothing about every MC encounter.  I forgot all about Living Bomb.  I forgot you could banish Garr adds.  I don't even know how Rag picks tank threat.  I remember nothing.  I'm not a liar.  Hell I was even raid leader for melee DPS in my vanilla guild for MC/BWL until transitioning to main tank for AQ/Naxx.  But I'm 36.  All those memories of when I was dicking around in WoW have been replaced by other stuff.
---
Amateur scientist reveals rock giants DO have genitalia.
---
It's a 3% hit increase just by using an axe for OH, so totally worth it IMO.
---
did u just camp the same zone? does the respawn typically pop in the same spot or u gotta search again?
---
To be honest MC/onixy doesn't require much so it is true you can do it what ever way you like it,
---
Ability for druids to use potions in form.
---
Feral druid played at min/max does like 30-40% more dps than ret played the same way.
---
Still describing dynamic spawns....  If there are more people in the zone(no layering) the spawns will respawn faster....
---
Granted! But at now it could be missed
---
The internet cafe I used to hang out and play at \~13-14 years ago used to have one of these.

Can confirm that it's not anatomically correct :p  
---
Or maybe it is, if we consider WoW canon xD

Black Lotus
---
You don't have to train a faster riding level, the epic mount just requires you be level 60 to use it.
---
Kinda sounds like you might want to look for a different raid group that plays the game more aligned with your mentality. If you're already getting frustrated because people aren't shelling out 100g a raid to re-spec you're probably in the wrong group.
---
Pretty sure it's 15 minutes, and yeah corpseruns are kinda huge so it forces you to learn to PvP to avoid. There's nothing wrong with playing on PvE it's just 10x easier.
---
Can do tomorrow what did you want to see the whole ui?
---
as a fellow dagger rogue, i plan running the royal trinket 2% hit and the quest 2% crit trinket, would that be good enough?
---
Maybe if he's looking at his meter, but WCL doesn't use your break time against you. It just adds up the Damage you did total for each boss and divides by the total time spent ON BOSSES.
---
&gt; Ordinary mana regeneration stops for 5 seconds after starting to channel (if the ability is channeled for less than 5 sec) or for the duration of channeling (if the ability is channeled for more than 5 sec; see the Five second rule).

Wowpedia suggests the Cleaner shows up for the Ungoro hunter quest demon too: https://wow.gamepedia.com/The_Cleaner#Source

Screen shot yours pls
---
I really appreciate you taking the time! Atlas loot rocks! There used to be a map add on as well that displayed the maps of dungeons and the locations of bosses. I don’t know if it is supported for WoW Classic. Thank you for the recommendation. I will check it out. 
---
Thanks again!
---
Likewise.
---
That said, if they absolutely had to release new content in Classic to keep players interested, and without it being the entire TBC expansion, I'd be ok with a Phase 7 consisting of Karazhan for PvE and Arenas for PvP.
---
In that case im doing 40x the dps of ret paladins lmfao
---
I always do this when i see ali guys fighting the demon.  
---
Then i finish them off  
---
gotta show the dominance before they get the bow, right?
---
If I had a dime for every classic+ post, I'd buy myself dinner at a 5 star restaurant.
---
If you can manage threat e.g. cleave instead of heroic it's fine. 80 up doesn't make a big difference (or whatever stam it is) imo. U get the stam elsewhere from LH helm, chest etc

Also makes active guilds more viable. I am frequently have like 1.5 pug members and 3-4 guild members in my group, with full 5s not being uncommon, add in friends outside the guild and most of my runs are with people I know
---
Feral dps does not really have hybrid tax you can easily out dmg people this early in classic you get out scaled later but right now you can be king. If you are boomkin you should only be there if you are alliance and sit in groups with Palladians.
---
I think they had an aneurysm when they were typing it.
---
this is exactly why i rolled a dagger rogue, seriously an assasin type of character, stealthing around to ambush their prey makes NO sense using dual wield swords imo.
---
Dagger 4 life.
---
As you said, average DPS.
---
Obviously someone has to do close to double that because it wouldn't be "average" if it was near the top.
---
Depends on how overfarmed the locations are on your server, and whether you can play during off-hours (late night or early mornings). You should explore all of the farming spots yourself at various hours you can play, as well as practicing solo dungeon farms (ZF/Mara/DME) to compare their gold/hr.
---
Oh noes, 8 people will have to kill trash mobs and do quests, so hardcore! lmao
---
New zones/raids/story are a given. I like the idea of a time reboot, comic book style. New universe new story type idea to keep the lore players happy. There are a million ways it could be tied in. Maybe we're not the only ones who discovered time travel, etc.
---
New races: I know this isn't going to happen, but I want more aggressive horde races. Ogres, Quillboars, Merlocks. We have plenty to work with that were ignored entirely in retail. I know this doesn't address the horde's need for a hot race, but maybe we could give the alliance some racial teeth while we're at it? Sentient yeti maybe?
---
Class tweaks: I'm going to highly suggest only tweaks here. I feel like there are a couple specs that could be reworked without ruining balance or same-ifying everything like retail did. Fixing Shaman and Paladin tank trees for example. It would help the 5 man content tank drought a bit, and the trees/abilities are almost all there already.
---
Racial tweaks: One of the more complained about issues on the pvp scene is that the horde's orc/undead racials are unreasonably strong given how weak most racials tend to be. Clearly something needs to be done, but I'm not at all sure what.
---
Paladin can outlast almost any class. Work to your strengths. Heal early and often. Force them to Kick/Pummel your heal when you're at 80%.
---
Yes that's my plan.
---
I haven’t seen one black lotus this whole time. I need to figure out where they spawn.
---
Hate to be the guy but with no context, this could be anything.
---
If you have a corrupt Loot Council, I think it's entirely fair to leave your guild that's funneling to players out of nepotism. I do think some people get upset too quick because they didn't get gear out of the raid, but it's really hard to infer anything from this with no further context.
---
I pay the gold to switch to arcane frost from my AoE spec every week for raid night. It's kinda a hot topic cause the way I look at it, if I'm paying the gold to make sure I'm doing the most damage I can so we clear quickly, then the other mages that I'm competing with for loot should be doing the same. I mean the content is easy so it's not that everyone needs to be in arcane frost, but it is just a bad look if you are one of the few mages not in the optimal spec.
---
Get an addon like the auctioneer suite, it will quickly tell you how much is an item vendored vs the enchanting mats from it..
---
It's a straightforward decision from there, whichever is highest goes. That's useful not only for greens but also for "blues" there is a shard in my server that sells for 5s in the AH (lowest part of SM) while the next sells for like 4g
---
The third option is selling the greens in the ah, very very rarely worth doing in my opinion in a fresh classic
---
More like McStanky!
---
Have you tried joining your server lfg channel? It could be /join LookingForGourp
---
That isn’t a classic change, the respawn after a despawn (not kill) was changed in vanilla to 15 minutes in a late patch.
---
All you're getting from your weapon is stats. The skill doesn't matter.
---
Maybe I just never paid attention before but I'm seeing this happen really frequently lately.
---
&gt; Pretty sure it's 15 minutes
---
sure thing
---
If the numbers OP is claiming are correct, he has three (including himself) ret pallies that are top 10 in any raid parses ever done for ret pallies in classic content.
---
Three! In one guild! Wow!
---
Imp cleave is worse than imp charge
---
I legitimately didnt replace Triune Amulet until Strat/Scholo.
---
You got mount and robes of the exalted to drop in the same run? I'm gonna go with MY salt cup haseth overflown.
---
&gt; but just shit viability and you're basically not allowed to do anything in raids.
---
What? You aren't playing the spec properly if you think the viability is shit. I'm pulling 490 DPS in MC as Shadow in blue gear.
---
It looks like according to that guide your using:
---
1 int = 1 point
---
1 spell dmg = 1 point
---
1 spell hit = 9 points
---
1 spell crit = 10 points
---
I've noticed this in just about every group I'm in.
---
I'm yet to meet someone who HASN'T played in classic and raided naxx it would seem.
---
Dude....I'm clearly coming across the wrong way somehow.
---
I am a druid, I main druid.  I tank, I dps, I heal... (0/30/21 all day)  I've been farming MCPs since I hit 60.  Got 12 in the bank for once my guild finally gets into raids in two weeks.
---
I'm not slamming feral dps.  (Or at least I'm not trying to.)
---
I'm slamming oomkin and ret pallies and true "meme specs" that are always going to be subpar dps, even if they tryhard.  
---
My point (poorly conveyed) is that bad specs, truly bad specs...cannot rise to above average even with tryharding.  Oomkin should've just gone mage/warlock, ret paladin should've just gone warrior or priest...these are the true meme specs and they aren't going to be above average just because someone tryhards.
---
while most people are obviously lying, i wouldnt instantly doubt someone simply because they dont know the mechanics now.
---
this content is like 13-15 years old, even people who actually did do it then arnt going to remember shit unless they played private servers (which arnt always accurate)
---
plus on top of that this content is easy as shit to clear, everyone back in vanilla was bad. they struggled to clear MC with anything less then full pre bis and a bunch of fire res. while now pugs are clearing with green gear. (so its not stretch of the imagination that someone that cleared naxx and or was r14 is bad now. they sucked then)
---
Just use gathermate2+carbonite shows you all the herb and mining node spawns all over the maps
---
slight class rebalance for the things that are really needed (taunt for paladins for example)
---
More class quests, they give a lot of flavors to each class !
---
transmog of course, so i can tank ragnaros in my beautiful scarlet monastery set &lt;3. Make it unlocking at level 60, as a reward for leveling so far, and so it doesn't change the "adventurer" feel of leveling where you regularly change gear.
---
Add some quests or meaningful things to do in Azshara, this area is too beautiful to be ignored.
---
New lvl 60 areas (mount hyjal, gilneas) with unique items or components to find/farm to add variety to a lvl 60 life. 
---
Add others raids at a similar level to the already existing one (so T1, T2, T3), with alternative set for ignored specs (for example, balance druids don't have anything to gain from T0 or T1 sets, all priests sets are for healing...)
---
More useful/powerful crafting patterns (only a few are really useful at max level)
---
More crafting specializations (like armorsmith vs blacksmith) for all professions, and more patterns tied to this.
---
Globally, make the player interaction more important by pushing up the number of relevant crafted-items.
---
If you don’t like it move on don’t come here posting shit like this we don’t care about your feelings.
---
You should give it a try, imho. Many times I got used to or even outright adored (hello, undead!) the shape of races I previously despised after trying them out. Gnome is one of them. In fact, the races i still like the least are human and orc males due to their needlessly bulky sizes.
---
Shadow has the mask from ZF to replace the hat.
---
As a mage, I got to lvl 60 with the chapeau, and even used it for quite a lot of runs too.
---
I’m still rocking my corsair wireless headset I bought in 2012... seriously best value of any PC part I’ve bought yet...
---
I mean sure the ear pad is falling apart but they are so comfy
---
If youre in no rush, definitely wait some for the price to drop. 
---
On my server the price of books are still dropping every day.
---
Look at it this way
---
for $15-$30 you got 16 DAYS of entertainment. That's awesome. 
---
If you aren't enjoying playing anymore, there's nothing wrong with just not playing for a while, or quitting entirely. 
---
Yes, with pvp you will have a lot to do, if that's your thing, but you aren't required to play between now and whenever that releases if you just aren't having fun!
---
I already sometimes don't really feel like raiding that day and just get my ass over there for an hour or two as a fury warrior. However feeling like I let 39 others down, when I dont come every single time, would be oppressing to me. More so once you get geared in 4 weeks, then waiting for another 3 years on that second bindings that never drops.
---
Having your drops spread out over every 4th ID or so might feel more empowering. In every sense of the word even as the MT gear is mostly tank tailored in the first tiers and has little application in other parts of the game.
---
The power spike a fury experiences when acquiring BRE, onslaught, DFT in the entirety of the game is in a whole different ball park than the MT getting scarab.
---
This sub is full of people who like to nitpick - to be fair, the game has had 15 year to be picked apart so it's par for the course. Is rather vexing though, it must be terrible for new players.
---
I wish people with this much dedication and determination would become doctors or physicists or so....
---
Im from Dredmist Horde, sometimes can be hard to find groups because of the lack of tanks and healers but think that os an issue in every realm.
---
But still see alot of people on the main citys and on the weekends theres always alot of MC and Onyxia pugs!
---
20 man and 40 man drop the same amounts of loot so if you're doing 40 you are effectively halving your chances already of getting gear.  Also if you're playing one of the most common classes in raids you'll have several others to compete with.
---
My dad raided nax back in the day. Lil ole me would watch
---
I've honestly only seen it brought up a handful of times in all my years of playing so maybe you're just running with/on a more immature server?
---
You're on shazzrah right? That guild name lol
---
In winterspring I saw an ally doing the kite just as I arrived to do the same thing on my horde hunter.
---
I dismounted, ran toward him, and cleared trash for him as he ran up the mountain. He would've gotten dazed in cheetah or wouldve had to change course last second with all the trash that respawned, but I helped a brother out.
---
I never understood people who camp others trying to do Rhok quest. It's such a difficult and time consuming thing. Camping or intervening on someone here seems like such a dick move.
---
They're probably confusing ZG with Zul'Aman - which released during TBC.
---
My guild just lost our shadow priest.  
---
Our warlocks are desperately trying to find her replacement.
---
You’ll find a spot.
---
We have a +1 rule if we fill spots with randoms, meaning if you roll and win for example a class item you aren't allowed to roll on the next class item. This way we avoid people hoarding loot and this is enforced on everybody. Warlock rolls, wins. Second item drops, rolls 100 but gets denied. Grown up dude goes APESHIT. 30+ people was fine it and understood the rules but this one dude was claiming it wasn't transparent that this was the rule and was going crazy aggressive calling it rigged and swearing. Had to server mute him. There's always one, rules are pinned on discord, told before we start clearing trash, even whispered upon giving the invite.
---
Dude the hit cap is 1% from gear.
---
To OP:  check out the Grobbulus newspaper.  Its next level and couple give you some ideas if you intend to keep it up.
---
Smolderweb ftw
---
I almost feel at a disadvantage having played in vanilla because you only partially remember quest chains, zones, or bosses instead of just going on fresh.
---
A lot of "oh yeah I remember this!" been going on.
---
It's French, man. French people using english acronyms are scarce.
---
I was sitting in /4 and /5 for a whole weekend, and i saw maybe 30 people join for the whole duration. 
---
I like my language and the pride around it but like, goddamit people, use tools available instead of being stuck with weird ideals.
---
Thanks mate! I won Netherwing Crown yesterday, whould you replace X of Frozen Wrath (40sp+8sp) with it? Netherwing Crown have alot of stats and 32sp+8sp, but is the higher sp really worth to keep?
---
I still prefer Blood of the Martyr and Cyclopean band since I have the spellpower from my other gear to still do great damage. Intell/Stam is king in PvP.
---
That would be botting
---
Herbed for my epic mount in vanilla. This was late '06 and vividly recall even when doing it 1am-4am that there was competition for everything. Farmed for 2 months to afford it. This will be the experience moving forward.
---
We've been spoiled with layers, but going to have to adjust. As others recommended, look into instances for farm runs. My main is a healer, so I'm leveling an herb'er lock just to try some solo instances runs. That's my current hope for cashflow.
---
Still the best thing I've seen since Classic started. Great work.
---
ye thats why no ones saying mage water would or should cost the same.
---
and thats also why you dont buy more then you need.
---
you buy a few stacks based on whatever non dungeon/raid shit your doing ( because why would you buy it if you were doing a dungeon when you could just invite a mage and get it for free) then buy more if you need it.
---
You don't benefit from weapon skill at all when in form.
---
Dont tell me the priest is an undead!
---
Does this show only the ones that have spawned or all possible locations?
---
Got an innervate from a feral druid for the first time in classic.  I'm only 44 and man, I felt like a god while healing.
---
Love hybrids for 5 mans.  They are able to stretch and help the group carry past holes that rigid classes can't overcome.  Well, the good ones anyways.
---
*"Well... there's no point crying over spoiled milk...."*
---
Why would anyone do this?
---
If you are referring to the Black War mounts that require rank 11. They are much more of a time investment. Wowhead says they will cost 100g but I’m not sure that’s true. Wowhead also says each requires their specific faction riding training but I don’t think that’s true? So we might have to wait and see. 
---
The mount system was changed in a later patch to have 2 different riding skills be the expensive parts and the physical mounts be cheaper so players could purchase multiple mounts. After this change, I THINK the pvp mounts were only 10g and did not require specific faction riding training.
---
If you are referring to the discounts provided for the regular faction mounts, you will receive an additional 10% discount at rank 3.
---
Epic mount is 1000g normally.
---
-10% discount at honored reputation
---
-10% discount at rank 3
---
=800g total
---
Sometimes you can't get loot every single MONTH in a 40-man raid.
---
Dunno if ret paladin bgets bis and gets all the melee DPS and caster elixirs in the casual non-maxed MC raid he will beat most of not all DPS
---
Thought having great personality and reputation with guild members is a must. There are 0 spots in raids for asshole retadins.
---
P.s. 
---
In late game it's all the same -warriors and rogues does all the damage, but you have mages just because you need rdp. So it doesn't Ewen matter if you are pure DPS , for example hunters are garbage at naxx and you take 1 for tranq shot 
---
Also warriors were not recent ment to be DPS considering their first set pieces their pure tank, and they ended up having broken high DPS in the late late game
---
true, but far easier since you can oil of immolation the adds and they disappear.
---
IMO the priest one is nowhere near as difficult as the hunter one
---
Everyone is getting wooshed up in this bitch one way or another.
---
If the demon is killed by the hunter yes it's a 2ish hour respawn time. If the demon despawns another way, its 15 minutes.
---
Source: I did this quest last week
---
Yupp
---
There are plenty of better ways, but the issue is they almost always make the task easier. If it was equally as hard (really in this case annoying) why would you want that instead? It was calls for convenience that hollowed out the game in the first place.
---
I'd rather see something like a spam limit on LFG, and maybe some policing of LFG spam in other channels like world (if it were made bliz owned) and trade.
---
its doable Bean have done it all day yesterday
---
Ill tame him at lvl 60 at 3am on EU servers. I don't need to min/max when leveling. Wish there were more 1.0 attack speed opinions.
---
It was intended :)))
---
&gt;Youll be worse on fights with aoe or target switching, but fine on rag.
---
That makes no sense. Combat Daggers still use Blade Flurry, which is the only cleave any Rogues have, swords or not. 
---
In terms of target switching, Rogues always lose our combo points. Spec doesn't matter for this.
---
I'm gonna attack not from now on lmao, excellent trolling advice
---
You can evade by jumping out the window on the way to Angerforge and by jumping into the arena and running up the wall. I haven’t found a place to evade on the gnomes though.
---
Better balance and gear itemization fixes for hybrids, basically. Anything else is icing on the cake but that's a must have.
---
Seen mostly on reddit honestly, never ran into it in game. I'm playing a PvE server so I think people are overall pretty chill in there
---
I’d recommend you stop doing everything at such a fast pace pace. There’s nothing wrong with taking a little time to enjoy the journey.
---
Tips for staying interested in-game: go make some friends and go stir up some shit in Kargath or Duskwood if you get bored. You could also go do trade skill stuff. Or you could just shoot the shit in guild chat. Classic is all about being social, and there’s nothing wrong with logging on and doing “nothing” except talk to people. It makes the experience better for you and everyone else.
---
I'm a male and play more female characters than male just depending on the race because the animations look better
---
imagine thinking every single person who plays a class is the same, because you had a bad interaction with someone once
---
I’d say the gold per hour is closer to 30g/hour. I kill pyro and ribbly.
---
Classic should just give paladins crusader strike ffs. It basically fixed the most major faults in the class design and didnt break the game. Paladins had crusader strike in Vanilla, it just happened as the last patch. JUST DO IT BLIZZARS
---
Eating Ass i see
---
but not timbermaw ... which is just weird ... is it because they can talk? or possible allias?
---
&gt; How am I a bad redditor
---
insulting people that disagree with you
---
&gt; Why is my memory on the subject not weighed similar to yours?
---
Because you're comparing playing on a pirate server with playing on the blizzard server. You assert that this is no different to playing on the blizzard server, I disagree with you, and you've not provided particularly compelling evidence that both cases are identical. In fact that strongest statement you make is that it's "very, very close to the actual TBC tuning". Let's go in a bit further
---
In any case, if you've been endlessly starting new characters and running heroics as a fresh 70 on this private server, then you're not even comparing yourself to "some random experienced wow player in early TBC 10 years ago". 
---
&gt; With regards to the argument about warlock fear, I don't see how I was full of shit? I've played the class for 14 years. I should be able to tell if fear is a consistent CC or a tolerable CC, I argued the latter.
---
Let's go back to the line of argument you made:
---
&gt; You: Running into packs everywhere? Yeah...great CC you've got there.
---
&gt; Other:  warlock fear is one of the most amazing and versatile cc that is heavily under utilized properly.
---
&gt; You: It's an inferior tool, used exclusively in situations where you're deflecting mobs, rather than CC'ing them. You're delusional friend.
---
So what you've done here (apart from insulting him by calling him delusional) is to redefine CC by splitting it into two categories: CC, and deflecting mobs. But a) deflecting mobs is a bullshit category you just made up in order to win the argument and b) even if deflecting mobs were a legitimate category, it's still by definition, a form of crowd control.
---
I would note that nowhere in that thread do you make any comments about fear being consistent or tolerable - you are arguing that it's not CC at all, because it's instead deflecting. So what you've done, when you recount this story to me, is redefine the argument AGAIN to make you win. You're now saying the argument was about whether fear was consistent or tolerable as a CC.
---
This, my friend, is why you're utterly full of shit when your're talking to this guy about warlock fear. It's almost as if you've never used curse of recklessness to cancel fear.
---
No chance that Angerforge is soloable by rogue.
---
This is how I cleared gnolls in westfall as a warrior in vanilla. They absolutely didn’t tether this way.
---
The tactic was:
---
Pull target, run until the adds retreat, kill the target mob and head back to camp for the adds (after bandages / eating).
---
Did you get a refund 15 years later or something
---
Azeroth is flat.
---
How does more mana mean more damage? It's pretty hard for dps from any mana-using class to go oom with runes and major mana pots.
---
Amen to that. I've developed in game friends because I know they are competent group members. I valued them enough as a game partner that I interacted and bonded with them socially.
---
Most of MC i remember because every boss is like maybe 2 mechanics, so they were easy.  I think I remember most of the BWL stuff.  AQ is hazy because it was such s scattershot instance.  You'd have shit like Skeram and Fankriss who are complete jokes, and then Huhuran I remember like a fucking book.
---
Naxx I remember most of the big things, but some smaller shit I might be forgetting.
---
Why is it called daily though? We are nearly two months into classic and you are at volume 6, does not sound too daily :P
---
Ohh that is out for classic now. Awesome
---
As a mage, I rolled on 6 items this week in MC and went 0 for 6. 7 mages in the raid, but the one that hurt the most was losing Staff of Dominance to a holy priest (his 97 to my 96, ouch).
---
Pathetic
---
It's almost like classic content is already on farm so anyone who jerks themselves off over dps charts is an idiot
---
"Spell damage and healing"
---
WOTLK naxx was one of the nails in the coffin that made me quit the game for 8 years until I discovered private servers.  Wrath was such an abomination I still get mad thinking about it to this day.
---
They're so bloody big
---
I put in "progressing" because you can't make that mistake if you were there working through the bosses with your guild the hard way.
---
I believe the discounts are additive.
---
So instead of doing 1000 - 10% = discount 1 - 10% = discount 2, which would be 810g
---
It’s 1000 - 20% = 800
---
Frost is way too immobile for me. In PvP you cant just stand around casting frostbolts and they dont have enough instant casts to make a difference.
---
&gt; I have no idea, but more than 100 players in an area (I.e. orgirmar or IF with a single hostile raid attacking it) will bring the server to a crawl and be unplayable.
---
i feel like people say this like it's a given or acceptable, that it's unpreventable (not saying you are). I get that Blizzard have tons more servers and people playing than private servers, but as i said before Allianceld literally take over Orgrimmar and RP like it was Stormwind city or something. Redridge would have Lord of the rings like battles and sure it lagged, but it was really playable. Why cant blizz do this , jesus
---
I respond to this shit because here is how this goes down most of the time.
---
"Hey I am proof you can be a ret paladin!"
---
Yes, you can be a ret paladin, it is a thing that is allowed, but it will kind of suck later and there isn't much you can do about it.
---
"You guys all hate me because you said this wouldn't work!"
---
It doesn't really work now anyway because you are the worst dps in the raid and it's never going to get better.
---
"YALL HATE ME BECAUSE IM SUCCEEDING."
---
You can do all of these things.  They function and you can do them.  They are not particularly good.  MC especially is so easy that you can clear it with about 25 people who aren't complete idiots.  This is also the first instance and it starts to scale from here.  Gear support for a lot of the hybrid specs isn't really there, or involves very contested items other specs want as well.  Gear doing's work as fast in vanilla either since you have 4 people and bosses drop 2-4 items.
---
I went through this before during vanilla.  People who loved playing their class or their weird spec slowly come to the realization their spec sucks.  It happened a lot with feral druids, but most of the non good specs hit this point as well.  We ended up taking maybe 2 hunters to raids because the rest quit.  We started with about 7-8 warlocks, but by naxx it was down to about 3.  People rerolled other classes because they hated falling more and more behind in terms of being useful.  It slowly worse on these people knowing that simply because of their class or their spec they would never be in the top ten, or they would be doing 70% of the damage of some other class.  People don't like feeling like they are directly shittier than other people through no fault of their own.  Yes you can do all these things.  Yes you can "succeed" with these things.  They are also not something you want to have be a substantial part of the raid because it can be a problem later.  I personally wished feral druids had been better because I loved their versatility.
---
WHAT. Really?
---
Got it. I'm a first time WoW player so didn't realize that was the way it was done here. In FFXI and FFXIV we always parsed the entire dungeon/fight/event. 
---
I will set up my Details differently and check it out.
---
For demon armor to work... yes we do not want full health.
---
what addon shows the character attributes like spelldmg?
---
I think its not as much about the dmg but more that the 2% hit opens up for getting other gear without hit % on it.
---
Looks like a lot of fun from the bench.
---
Yeah I figured, thanks!
---
Whoah Methtroll with the gamer language there
---
Yeah, I'm enhancement and I generally skip shocks to be able to not drop below 75 or at least 50% mana. The backup heals are more valuable.
---
Yup. I ran the shit out of BRD in vanilla, but quit the game at some point during BC.
---
I was tanking a BRD run recently, and had absolutely no memory of certain bosses and areas. Had to have others explain what to do and which way to go.
---
Why on earth would you waste 100g a week doing this? MC is really easy and unless you're going for speedrun times, you can spec however the hell you want and jot have any difficulty. All the mages in my guild are full frost or elemental, with one going winter's chill
---
I lucked out and got my t1 bracers. Never been that excited about an epic since... Well, vanilla. Makes it much better that you don't leave in full epics after one raid (unless you're a druid)
---
We have 5-6 normally show up for raids...and everything still gets passed to mages
---
I used to tell my friends about an Orc on my server back then (Dethecus German) who was famous/infamous for being just the most efficient farmer, raider and good at PvP. Sadly, now with your post I noticed that I forgot his name and even his class. This makes me a bit sad as I really liked to share that tale as it's been the only one I was sure to re-tell it in a manner that you immediatly knew it happened, but now I can't seem to remember the details. I just remember that once late-night in OG he was trying to sell something on the /2 and everyone, literally everyone started an auction in the /2 and spammed stupid macro emotes just because of him.
---
Good times, I yet have to experience something like this in classic.
---
Go to YouTube and look for videos of Rextroy, pallytime215 and drakova.
---
Typically outhealing the first damage of an opponenent ant then giving them the stick should go pretty okay. There are different strategies for every fight.
---
I was very careful not to make any statements that encompassed everything like you just did. And i did not make up any fantasy worlds, just remarked on the difference between now and then.  I'm terribly sorry if you don't like the fact that it's a very real difference and exists. but by the sounds of it you're part of the problem anyway so I'm not very surprised.
---
Join my guild.  Back in vanilla I raided part way through BWL with a group of drunk college kids and a legally blind grandmother.
---
I’m a woman and I’ve played with a lot of other women (was even briefly in an all-female guild in TBC), and the only people I’ve ever played with who were special snowflakes about their theorycrafted (bad) spec and demanded loot or special treatment were all men lmao. It’s just confirmation bias. There are less women who play WoW in general, so when you run across one behaving in a stereotypical “girl gamer” way (getting special treatment or loot from officers, flirting to get gold, etc), you start to think there’s a huge pattern when there really isn’t. It’s all anecdotal.
---
I'm pretty easy to entertain but this wasn't even remotely funny try again lol
---
&gt;Streamers are a big thing for the young audience. Practically god. If a streamer they liked asked them to jump off of a bridge, most would
---
Did you type this with 2 index fingers? "Practically god"? You sound extremely out of touch. Kids are greatly entertained by streamers, yes, and are likely to want to play with them. I see no issue. The fact that you do reminds me of the old farts who were convinced children would kill each other over pokemon cards of my youth. Please.
---
Dual wielding penalty only applies to auto attacks, so your specials are guaranteed to hit with 6%. Having more hit is still useful, but only partly so, making it a less desirable stat compared to crit and others. Especially combined with the HS queuing "bug", eventually you'll reach a point where you barely do any white hits at all.
---
What are the BiS orc warrior weapons in phase 2? I know main hand is the Deathbringer, but i can't decide which off hand to use. I don't know if i should get a sword or keep the axe or get another Deathbringer. Currently my off-hand is the Flurry Axe. also i cannot use Elemental Sharpening Stones on my Flurry Axe because it's too low leveled.
---
[Here's my take on minimalism](https://imgur.com/a/g6DC5DK)
---
Sometimes you see that mage drinking at 10% health and you just Wana see a big crit.
---
I am getting some heavy 'troll post' vibes here... at level 3, you need to kill about 15 things to level so it really shouldn't feel like a grind yet.  But if it does, stop now. Uninstall and don't look back.  At 19 minutes per week you don't have time to progress.
---
O make not me look
---
The only way you can make taunt more accurate is the Naxx tier set I believe. As long as your main hand is 100% accurate, you are fine on hit, but more never hurts to make your OH more accurate, it is probably just less valuable than crit for example.
---
No way to do it in-game otherwise macros would let you auto cast perfect optimal dps rotations in raids if you could do multiple actions with a single keystroke.
---
You'd have to use keyboard/mouse software or something like AutoHotKey. Both options fall under a grey area (It's legal for multi-boxxing, but it's not legal for spamming 1,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4 to do a perfect dps rotation while you eat.)
---
[The Amani Empire hated that]
---
When I said vanilla I ment early patches precisely :)
---
Awesome thanks.
---
They can be useful for limited crowd control. Other than that mid grade dps.
---
The embarrassment of being nostalgic seeing this.
---
you can turn off HS ?
---
I joined in TBC but was a hardcore raider who DOMINATED Naxx in vanilla.
---
&gt; I'm just not sure the best way to keep it consistent with the game's design aesthetic 
---
It's mix and matching items from the game together, the only change transmog does is making them relevant stats-wise. Witthout transmog, at lvl 60, 90% of the sets and weapons in the game are irrelevant because using them instead of lvl 60 loot is shooting yourself in the foot.
---
But the costume sets are a good compromise between "levels 60 can look like everything" and "levels 60 can't use 90% of items without penalizing themselves'
---
You generate combo points on new targets more slowly with a more expensive instant, and while ssing from the front is bad, it will almost certainly happen on trash pulls when tanks are moving stuff chaotically or peopke are pulling aggro. This difference isnt large, which is why i said its basically the same.
---
bad news my friend turns out YOU are the gamer dad
---
Although this image tells almost nothing of the context of teh situation, there are absolutly terrible guilds out there that make all efforts to bend and twist the rules they set on their own just to funnel as much loot to a very small set of players, and that of course enfuriates the rest of the members. On the other hand I´ve raided with amazing groups that the raid leader is as impartial as it gets and tries to make the best out for everyone, and in this cases I dont mind getting a couple of weeks dry of loot, as long as I see fairness in the distribution
---
Weights will change over time based on your gear. If you already have a ton of spell power for example, 1% hit will be worth more than if you had less spell power. 
---
Very generally, you can determine your specific weights by finding your current average dps factoring in crits, hits, and resists. Then calculate how much more dps you would do with 1% more chance to hit. Then finding how much additional spellpower would increase your dps to the same amount. Most of the time that's what those spreadsheets are doing assuming they're accurate.
---
Yeah but you can't get any raid gear unless you're respeccing every week.
---
Meanwhile, I've having a hard time getting the Reed Trinket...
---
Yeah i forgot soo much..I quit WoW before Naxx but raided AQ till end and went to Warlord rank (hey i have ss's to prove it somewhere on old HD!) I don't brag about it in game at all unless ppl ask more think i only told one guy so far.
---
Honestly WoW was never specially hard game ,not then and especially not now in retail.If you put time in it and are normal person you can get all
---
6-7 days might be for some people who are extremely efficient and level with a lot of rested xp
---
I was at about 9 days at 45 or so. I hit 60 around 12 or 13 I believe, and I think that's fairly typical
---
But it’s sexist that you assume it’s because she’s female, though. You have no way of knowing that. I’ve played in plenty of guilds where men were given special treatment and loot just because they were an officer (in a corrupt loot council) or because they were IRL friends with the GM. But nobody says, “typical man, getting special treatment!” You’re making about gender when the OP even deliberately hid the girls’ gender because of assumptions like this.
---
44 is half way there.
---
So whatever time it took to get you where you are now.
---
it took houndreds of hours.
---
Huh.  That released.  I forgot.  Guess I should go pick up my pre-order.  Been too distracted with Classic to even think about the CE.
---
Your argument that exercise is irrelevant is both incorrect and just plain stupid.
---
How does crit % compare to spell power for an arcane frost build. What’s the break point? 15sp? 20sp? 30?
---
There is a PVP leveling spec in there.  He discusses multiple specs.
---
Seeing a lot of misinformation here OP, I’m a paladin and can say you are very strong in wPVP so long as you use CDs properly.
---
TL;DR manage cooldowns, get engineering, and use Blessing of Freedom and pally is really strong an effective
---
I have killed many many horde of all classes in all specs in wPVP and I will share my experience.
---
1) Engineering, get it and level it.  The utility that comes will win you tons of fights. You don’t even need the Finnish death ray to get huge utility from the profession. Net and Grenades will win you a ton of fights
---
2) Spec Ret for SoC and movespeed, these will let you burst heavy and chase people down, BE SURE YOURE USING blessing of freedom, cannot stress this enough, it’s so strong vs every class
---
3) Use stun/repentance to interrupt or secure a kill, when they are low, hit em with your stun, hope for a SoC proc, and win.
---
4) you literally can’t be killed, between bubble heal, lay on hands, and a health pot, you have to be killed 3 times compared to other classes.... and if you get jumped by a bunch of horde, bubble hearth like a pro.
---
5) most importantly: play dirty. You see a shaman soloing an elite? Stun him, hit him, he’s dead, bubble and run from the elite.  You see a pair of mages AoE farming in STV? Wait for them to gather a pack, stun one, focus the other, watch them both die to mobs.... then bubble and run out.  Do this repeatedly till the 60s get called in then bubble hearth
---
Tanking, probably since there's a shortage of tanks it seems for 5 mans. I'm on a PVP server, so yeah.
---
yeah, that's a screenshot and a ban
---
ElvUI has a collection of DataTexts that you can attach to various panels. DataTextBars lets you create more of those anchors. You might be able to run ElvUI and DataTextBars to get that, and then disable the rest of ElvUI's features if you just want the data texts.
---
Now I have your reddit name Frueh...you are doomed.

If only he was a tauren

Fair, but rogues are drowning in hit anyway.

Yeah man I’m at 9 and 55 so it’s definitely taking some time. Fishing 225 though!

Ass back, as in “get your ass back in the fight”

44 is halfway as far as total experience though right? Not necessarily half way through leveling. 45-55 was some of my fastest leveling.
---
Yeah people dont get that in vanilla its about what good for the raid, not the individual.
---
If you have done it before and have a general idea of where good spots to quest are, but you aren't solely focusing on leveling quickly (so you're running dungeons not just for quests, you're leveling profs here and there, helping a friend now and then) then 10 days is a decent time. 
---
If you're not super familiar with leveling in vanilla then going past 10 days isn't surprising, though 10 days to 43 is a bit on the slower side even for a casual/first timer.
---
Yeah, that's why I'm hoping the pet and bow work. The "and effects" on the description is giving me a little hope. 
---
I just commented here to see if someone knew how the bonus works. I was hoping there was something higher level with the same wording that's understood a little better.
---
&gt;so that's why you are not able to who fast.
---
I get that, but with GBB I can Who the majority of people i want to Who, I click them, I get the feedback, I click the next one, I get the feedback.
---
With puggle, I click who and then it's grey'd out. No idea how long it's greyed out as after a good 3~ minutes I either do it myself or do /reload to fix that.
---
&gt;As for BRD I think theres keywords like "emp" (emperor run) and Lava (lava-run? I guess?). You can edit those.
---
Likewise, with BRD I had groups popping up for Maraudon that weren't even using the word Princess, like LFG ST or LF1M Tank Mara, and these popped up under BRD.
---
It did it's job initially but GBB works better for me at current, if that ever changes I'll hop onto the next one i need.
---
In changing profession specialization, for instance Gnomish to Goblin Engineering, what does the process look like with the Book Soothsaying for Dummies?
---
Do I have to unlearn engineering once I make all the Gnomish things I want, THEN read the book to go Goblin?
---
So raids are mostly just fury warriors and mages for dps?
---
what kinda Walmart closes??
---
I've heard about 8 /played 
---
Just depends on how much time you waste. Fishing and farming and playing the AH can't take up a bit of time.
---
Doesn't matter how fast if you're enjoying the game.
---
Why is this NSFW it’s just a guy holding his bread
---
It currently doesn't seem to save AH price. It resets my price everytime I clear/change the session. Is that intended?
---
Heres my take on minimalism[](https://imgur.com/a/yGX8vV2)
---
I think most of us here are gamer dads lol
---
I mean in wow overall. I remember I had my rank 11 mount as a raptor
---
I started playing in the weeks leading up to TBC. I technically played during vanilla but the vast majority of my play was in TBC. I just tell people I started in TBC.
---
I've put in at least 3 weeks and I'm 45. Granted, if I didn't impulsively roll alts and level them up to 25-30 a few times, I'd probably be 60 by now, but I think it probably takes about 2 weeks for the average person to hit 60 if you're just focusing on that one character.
---
Like it’s a fucking discussion I don’t understand why there are always people like u that have a dick up their butt to comment on my shit like I’m that upset. Eat a dick
---
As a hunter, no wisdom judgement means no man on longer fights, even with mana potion and runes. I'm guessing evocation/lifetap is needed without the judgement as well.
---
Just got it up to 268, so close to perfection, if it wasn't for that one downvote
---
“You gonna eat that? No? Cool. Mind if I?”
---
I left a guild full of people that "had KT on farm" and joined a fresh guild that was like "it's okay, a lot of us are first time raiders!"
---
Went from 8+ hours trying to manage 8/10 in MC to nearly full-clearing MC and Ony in under 3 hours. Downed Rag last week for the first time in my life and it felt awesome, Sunday we'll do it again.
---
Now, if I can just get some damn Warlock gear to drop.....
---
Yep. I agree as well, 45+ was stupid fast, but I was grinding dungeons as a tank.
---
It's an interesting dynamic. I exclusively play male characters, except for Gnomes, for obvious reasons.
---
I work at a home with people with addictions, aggresiv behaviour and disalibites. Hope that is good enough :)  
---
I use my herb farming to chill &amp; stress off.
---
You forgot to mention that you are leading 5 different teams as well.
---
Yepp thats correct!
---
Raid gear for mages isn't particularly good until Naxx. PvP gear will be better for PvP.
---
Agreed. I had a much easier time finding groups when I was shadow. Since going to my raid heal spec, can go hours without finding a group. My guild is huge, but we have way more healers than available groups running at any time. Basically limited by number of tanks. At least as dps there are 3 spots open, but for healing it is 1/1 with tanks for dungeons. Not ideal.
---
actually it is
---
Night Reaver is bis for horde as they can bit get the glacial stone
---
No, a good raid has a balance of all classes as each class brings something to the fight.
---
I can’t speak directly on the druid question but I play a priest so can provide some insight on the hots issue.
---
This may be due to an addon I’m not aware of, but I have noticed that I can’t always overwrite other priests’ renews. My theory is you can’t overwrite if someone’s hot is ticking for more than yours.
---
I’m the only priest in our raid who is PI. So I miss out on some additional +heal from deep holy and I’m not specced into imp renew. I can tell from Details (damage/heal meter) which priest is mainly using renew. That priest is deep holy and has higher +heal than me. I have never been able to overwrite his renews. But it seems that he has overwritten some of my renews. 
---
I know this doesn’t answer your question, but it may help in discovering an answer or developing a system that works for your guilds’ druids.
---
DD best server.
---
Topping the dps charts until the boss gets to 20% and the fury warriors destroy you.
---
You are experiencing peak woosh.
---
Nice. I got super lucky and rolled a 100 on the MH a couple days ago. I need to get the OH now.
---
I am not sure if you are horde or if you are alliance. However, I have learned to never trust a horde.
---
plaguelands too high for you. Un Goro is easy i finished in 8 hours of play time maybe? hit more princess runs until you’re 52/53 or have what you want and then BRD arena and that junk?
---
Jumper cables are a rogue's raid utility.  High chance of failure but when it works, you are the darling of the raid.
---
Recount is what I used and use now.  Super easy to set up and gives you exactly what you need.  Details is more powerful but you need to play with it to get what you want.  Think of it as Recount = Windows.  Details = Linux.  If you just want to see your damage, recount.  If you want to go deep on it, Details.
---
It's not the end of the world not getting your mount at level 40. Keep going like you have been and you'll have enough by 41 or 42. Gold really starts to accumulate fast around 38 or so.
---
Ony cape also comes to mind, or is there something better out there for Spriests?
---
Always that one guy
---
BFA lore be doing this to him right now
---
agreeeeeeeee
---
Ah thanks!
---
Honestly I did play vanilla and do the same thing because I just don't remember. Or just simply say "I have no idea where I'm going". First time I ran ZF people were talking about the stairs fight before we got there. I had no idea what they were talking about. Once we started the fight it came back to me, but before that I had completely forgot.
---
I think WPL has a cauldron questline there that gives good xp , that’s where I would go. If you have any BiS in scholo you can do that too in a few levels
---
Yup [our MT](https://trafficguild.us/guild-data/member/43ea4d76-b43f-4330-9854-d47a0f1b4a54) is stupidly geared, and this only shows the raids since we started tracking. He got loot in some of our PUGs.
---
Same can be said about gladiator rank and retail as well.Just takes time learning mechanics ,learning pvp team comps and practising enough.WoW was never super hard game you needed time and dedication
---
That’s surprisingly little! Thanks
---
Alotta people who raided naxx back then got burned out on the game and quit. I know a bunch of em, heck even reading the server reconnection on the wow forums you see em. I haven't touched the game since early BC - came back all these years later and I couldn't even remember the layout of any city besides ironforge. Forget dungeons...
---
What level is a good start for BRD Arena?
---
How's that unemployment going for you?
---
Hey now, I never raided naxx back then. I was an elitist pvper who literally thought that raiding was something bad players did who couldnt compete in pvp, since it is just about memorizing mechanics of fights. 
---
I would find myself from 15 years ago insufferable as all hell nowadays.
---
there's a lot of delusional hybrids in here trying to justify them taking DPS gear over classes that actually do damage
---
here's Esfand's (scumbag streamer with a bunch of clout chasers spamming PI on him and throwing gear at him thus resulting in the glorious #1 ret pally parser): https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/character/us/faerlina/esfand
---
here's a random DPS warrior that was like 256th DPS on golemagg:
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/character/eu/mograine/lydiah
---
The difference is monumental. Play what you want, but don't expect literally anyone except your other mentally diseased hybrid friends to agree with your "not that big of a difference" assessment
---
I don't think they show up on your friends list regardless. BUT, I had a friend online in my guild whom I know was on "offline mode," and your name will still show up as online within the guild. So, that's another layer to think about.
---
Yeah that makes sense. I know Ele sham are very mana hungry in vanilla. I’d imagine your raid dps also plays a large role; I see some Rag kills where he dies before the warlocks need to lifetap at all, whereas most guilds kill him a bit slower. Depending on where your guild falls and how willing you are to burn a major mana pot and demonic/dark rune on every kill, your relative value for int would change a bit.
---
I mean, raids can be kind of a PITA to deal with as far as schedules and such.  There's a lot of dungeons and it will take a long time to get dungeon gear, and tanking those is tons of fun.
---
I'd say play it till you get tired of it, then maybe switch to a hybrid holy/prot build so you can still tank while being able to heal also.
---
We also don't know if TBC is even coming to classic.  I wouldn't level a character I wouldn't want to play without any changes coming.
---
Nice, thanks!
---
Well... At least the pattern doesn't matter
---
Rogues don't have much for AOE in classic so they'll probably fight 1v1.
---
Would like to see your source or citation for 'the overwhelming majority' shared accounts ... yeah, pretty much bullshit. Account sharing definitely happened, but it was also a bannable offence (Blizzard could track IPs and suspicious account activity in 2005, you know), and far from 'the vast majority' did it. Stop peddling nonsense.
---
Autoshot damage is your #1 source of damage as a hunter, so even on longer fights, prioritizing those stats will still output more damage then chasing a larger mana pool/regen...

If you can afford it crusader on both weps. They can both proc at the same time incresing strength by 200 for 15 seconds

Yikes. I don't care if they're hybrid, low skill officers are a detriment to a guild's long term health.
---
Assuming this isn't the full story and there must be something she does that balances things out a bit. Maybe she's a steller admin or recruiter, can't put a pricetag on those skills.
---

---
That's exactly the reason why hybrids rock! You have UTILITY and you should be proud of it.
---
I'll say I loved my Shaman back in the day, and she's been shelved for years, just catching up to whatever level cap is and then playing another toon. I rerolled a Shaman in Classic because I wanted to see if it was as enjoyable as I remembered, or if it really was crummy all along and I just didn't know better.
---
I ran SM the other day (to heal, even though I only have like, 5 points in the tree), and was underleveled for the area. I thought I'd be bored and just healbot. But there were plenty of opportunities to drop the right totem at the right time, clear poisons, purge enemies, interrupt spellcasts, and autoswing/miss a lot. I didn't do much DPS, but no one died, and I actually contributed to the run despite mobs being red.
---
It's a very good feeling not just to notice that someone's got something wrong (fear, curse, poison), but actually be able to do something about it.
---
Tbf player warlocks do fight demons too 
---
I’m assuming they are like demon hunters where they fight fire with fire 
---
The whole soul shard business is shady doe 
---
But shadow priests are just as shady
---
Even the Bursty paladins are no wear near bursty enough to really control most fights.
---
Your biggest bursts is as a Reckoning paladin, but its still a slow build and you need to take a lot of damage to be able to dish a lot of damage (IE get crit 4 times before you even attack).
---
The strength of all paladins is that they are a healing class that are EXTREAMLY mana efficent. You can outlast almost any class as long as you don't get counterspelled/silenced.
---
Save your mana, endure their damage and wittle people down slowly. Keep BoWisdom up at all times. Swap your aura for either resistant or for a bit of reflected damage on people.
---
Use bandages inside your bubbles.
---
On any class with mana you can outheal their damage, even as ret. Warriors and rogues, just keep smacking them down slowly while keeping your health up.
---
I was fury prot when i hit 60 with little gear. You can do everything, except maybe not the 2nd half of UBRS, which you can off tank. Spec Protection if you are one of the main tanks for raids. Other than that the popular build right now is arms. 
---
If you're worried tank BRD, LBRS, until you get some peieces.
---
DPS some dungeons too, i got a few peices from scholo while dpsing because the tank didnt need. It will also help you see how others tank dungeons, giving you an idea on pulls and and examples for boss strats.
---
If we're tapping mid combat were out of mana and need more to keep doing DPS. That's how our class is designed and yes it's your job at that point.
---
However, the majority of us are fully capable of looking at your current mana situation and determining if we need to use a healthstone, bandage, pot, life drain or tuber. Additionally we gain passive HP5 through Demon Armor and in some cases our gear, so if we are AT FULL HEALTH we are getting no benefit from those sources.
---
If you are spam healing a lock in combat to keep them at 100% and there is no source of damage affecting said lock, you are wasting your mana. Don't start healing us until we're at 50% and use a cheap heal or HOT. 
---
TLDR, l2p with a lock
---
I did a MC where 2 druid pieces dropped on the 1st two bosses. There was not 1 Druid in the whole raid..
---
casting water is easy
---
dealing with the entitled pricks is what wears you down. 
---
ive had multiple ppl in a single day get mad at me when i wasnt even near a town or settlement because i told em no.
---
ive been told "you exist only to make people FREE water" (and then was put on ignore so i couldnt say anything)
---
and that one is a fairly common response.
---
see people are nice when they get cheap (or even free) water (and portals ofc), but the moment you say no they show how they really feel.
---
god forbid a mage not run halfway across the map too craft water or make a portal for some stranger. 
---
see every mage starts off more then willing to make water, some of em have even responded too me saying shit like what you said.
---
see 1g is piss money, you dont make water and portals just for that (i usually just told ppl to get me the portal stone) you do it to help people out. so why would you do it when your treated like a sub human piece of shit?
---
simple answer: you dont.
---
I went from the old naga to the redragon perdition and I’m enjoying it so far. Had it for about a year and a half and zero issues yet.

I’ve heard of people having issues with them, and the software is kind of atrocious, but for $30 it’s overall quite a good mouse.

&gt;I know about sheep into pyroblast 
---
That's not a realistic scenario outside of duels. Nobody uses Pyro without PoM in group pvp.
---
- Blastwave is an extra instant, and its a daze which isn't dispellable
---
- Fireblast reduced to 6.5 sec cooldown with 10% bonus crit chance and 6 yards extra range. Lets you get at least 2 fireblasts in per fight. CoC is stuck at 10 seconds.
---
- Scorch is 1 second shorter cast time than frostbolt, and fire gets pushback protection. 
---
- Getting locked out of fire spells doesn't remove your survivability like it does for frost.
---
- Frost's only advantage comes in the form of Ice Barrier ... which priests and shamans will instantly purge.
---
-  Fireball is actually viable in pvp contrary to what the hivemind will tell you, because 41 yd range easily outranges everything except hunters.
---
- Impact procs are deadly af
---
- 30/21 spec makes nova into scorch/fblast crits for 2k total damage really fast and easily repeatable
---
Yes, it makes things fair in a guild setup that plan to raid a while together.
---
Our guild just does /roll 1-100 with almost everything. They just ask if you win a few things in a row you maybe pass on the next thing that drops.
---
No, you want to know the average profits. If you get two crystals in one run you'd make twice the money.
---
Cannibalism is technically vegan since it’s cruelty free to animals
---
Since your professions are up, I would say either grind mobs like satyrs in Felwood or bats in EP. They have some good drops for gold. 
---
But personally I would just grind dungeons so as to start collecting your pre raid bis. By the time you’re done collecting you’ll be 60 easily. Plus dungeons can be quite profitable themselves if you got the lucky rolls.
---
I’ve been 60 on my warrior for a while and still scraping up my last pre raid bis.

I checked last night and I'm sitting at 8days 14hrs played at 59.6
---
I did quite a bit of dungeon playing instead of questing.  Basically all the end zones EPL/WPL/Winter/etc I haven't even touched yet
---
Gentil.
---
you could say the same thing, but vanilla warlord was legit just tagging as many things in bgs as possible. which is why warriors/hunters/mages got more than rogues. honor isn't rewarded based on damage dealt, oyu just needed to tag it
---
Keep questing, pick the highest priced reward from quests to vendor. It adds up well. Don’t buy every skill, just the stuff you need in your questing rotation.
---
i think 52... that’s where i started as DPS could get away with 50 i bet, but not sure
---
He’s wrong, it is possible. You will need to pvp a lot if you want to rank quickly though, and even then you’re looking at 2+ months to go from r1 to r11 if you’re one of the top pvpers on your server.
---
Keep questing, my friend. Stay out of Orgrimmar as much as possible.
---
There's some money to be made at the AH, but you won't earn any exp. Keep questing and you'll earn gold while you level up.
---
And as long as you're grinding mobs in a good spot, you won't be mounted anyway.
---
Keep calm and charge on.
---
There's a trinket called Linken's Boomerang that helps with that. It only has a 3 minute cooldown. But honestly, I mostly body pull and don't have any issues.
---
Post your logs.

Horde players deserve this type of disservice
---
I was so confused that I ended up just leaving after a while. Did they ever actually attack either IF or SW?
---
Go play retail. That should be plenty easy for you.
---
I mean I depends on the scenario as well. I have already examples o people trying to compete for top 5 dps in MC but they die half way through. But I'm sitting close to bottom of the dps on my warlock but survives every fight.
---
The end result is what matters unless it's a fight aginst the timer.
---
Crusader is obviously the best
---
Bring all the races to Classic.
---
Rebalance skills just such that the glaring OP/super weak shit is a little better.
---
Give us outlands and northrend, but no flying mounts.
---
LFG feature, its just to find a group, i think its fine, and doesn't have to have TP or w/e. You still will interact/talk with the people who join. No cross-realm.
---
all the BG's.
---
no Epic classes.
---
CURRENT GRAPHICS!
---
Immobile? Not sure i agree with that. Cold snap with 2 iceblocks is pretty mobile when you want to create space. Also, rank 1 frost bolt ridiculously good for kitting, slowing, and getting frost bite procs. You for sure you wont do as much damage as fire, but mobility is incredibly high when played correctly.
---
T2 isn't a year away.
---
Chromag, Nef, these aren't minute fights.
---
My Paladin does this right now. Tanks adds and trash and heals/cleanses on bosses.
---
Plenty of gear and I get to roll on tanking weps and shields as well.
---
Even TFC was a masterpiece
---
When you think about it, wow is a game about a string of racist murdering sprees.
---
Well ...
---
A tank, in the "old" sense of the word, would normally output fairly low DPS.
---
A tank who's fury/prot hybrid, dual wielding and going all out while getting massive extra rage from damage taken ... there's a world of difference there.
---
If the dude in OPs comment is falling behind a tank (by the "old" definition), something wrong.
---
Of course we go as a group. The problem is the other side does too.
---
Ok but in my example Stand Up comedy isn't my living (which is why i apply to other jobs) but I can still use it as experience and talk about the skills and lessons etc.. even though nothing tangible is on the line. If I screw up I might not get another shitty bar show gig that pays 2 beers. Big whoop. I can still use that experience to talk about things it's taught me and how I could bring those skills and lessons into the work place.
---
The only transfers available right now are free ones from overpopulated realms to lower populated realms. They may offer paid transfers to any realm later on but they haven't announced when they will do that.

lol nope

2 years ago I was running lvl 60 dungeons on repeat on a pserver with my eyes closed, even that's been enough time for me to get lost and forget mechanics
---
I've seen people argue both ways too. But I tend to see more people argue that it stacks.
---
Never experimented to find out if it's true or not myself. Hopefully it is since I certainly use thick hide for my bear.

Is there an addon for tracking felwood plants similar to how you can track herbs on the mini map?
---
Hi!
---
I'd advise to get to unfriendly with timbermaw, if you can, to be able to turn in the princess quest in moonglade without issues!
---
Be sure you've done quests in these areas imo: hinterlands, searing gorge, tanaris, feralas, blasted lands!
---
When these are done, try: ungoro, wpl, burning steppes, winterspring. With the dungeons you do on the way, you ll prob get to 60 already.
---
play a warlock *haha* no but seriously just keep grinding another level you should have it
---
I definitely see where you're coming from.   There were guilds that had things down to such a degree that they could complete runs with 25/30 people AND still carry people.  We did that towards the end of Vanilla too.  I think for guilds that are progressing through content they often can't afford to compromize, however after a while when bosses are easily on farm, then there is far more room form leniency.
---
And also I guess, factoring in 15 years worth of all the knowledge being out there in public and such.  The content just isnt as hard as it seemed 15 years ago, and that is the long and the short of it.
---
What's the respawn timer after someone finishes?

How valuable was escape artist or did you find yourself staying relatively stationary?

See the second picture posted. You can check your boss kill count via Deadly Boss Mods.
---
On the contrary, I've found tons of success in telling everyone that I'm new to classic, and absorbing any information they can give. People are actually super understanding and awesome when you don't act all high and mighty. I raid lead as MT now and I'm having a blast learning everything I can.
---
Well it may not be possible but it was very coincidental then that his wife's character got hacked and both me and my other brother told brother number 3 not to message the hacker who was currently on his wife's hacked account. He says fuck that and messages them and is almost immediately hacked himself. Also worth noting this happened back in 2008/9. It may not have been the reason for how his account was hacked but it just seems very strange that it happened right after he messaged the hacker in anger.
---
I played a bunch of vanilla, but I would still tell that to people, since I forgot pretty much everything. My first strat run I was outside the room on rivendare and got stuck outside the entire fight. 
---
"Sorry, i didnt know the doors closed, i havent been in this place for 15 years"
---
Felt likr such a dumbass, but the group was cool with it and we got him on the next try.
---
&gt; Cold snap with 2 iceblocks is pretty mobile when you want to create space.

Nothing about iceblock adds mobility.

We need that guy

Yep ^

1. Get auctionator and vendor Price addons

2. Scan the AH with auctionator on a regular Basis

3. voila of you hover over an item you now get a tooltip that shows vendor and AH prices

---
Then he sees me, an dual wield warrior at 50% health and decides to attack. What he didn't realize was that I am prot spec, so I equipe my shield and switch to Def stance. (this happened to me yesterday, completely spanked the rogue)
---
TY Spy addon, reminds me to get that trap ready.  As most hunters know, leveling in hunter gets pretty mindless, love that addon wakup call.
---
That's fine and all, but boomkins should expect to be dead last on loot priority. Their tier is for healing and the gear they need is the same as what locks/mages need.
---
Take it from a fellow DPS player with less utility than a mage - you've got to run your own groups.  Also, look into getting a bigger guild that runs dungeons regularly.

Increases healing from spells and abilities, not items.

sounds like something a rogue would do between 2nd and 3rd boss of BWL, cause I did the same thing
---
Not sure I agree with this at all. The only instant cast fire has over frost is blast wave and frost kind of makes up for it with improved coc.
---
 Ice block, cold snap and ice barrier offer way more pvp strength than anything in the fire tree. Deep fire is straight up not good for pvp. Elemental (hybrid fire/frost) maybe
---
Battle of the Bastards was the greatest 1 hour in television history followed closely by Breaking Bad's Oxymandias episode and I will die on that hill.

Actually I will die on just about any hill because I suck at pvp.

Make a bank alt. Mail all your stuff to bank alt to put on ah or sell to vendor.

Could you somehow have a frost trap so you can volley + engi nade the imps ? seems like a waste to not kill the last boss if you can somehow nuke them
---
Im pretty sure its brutality blade, because as nice as the racial is, theres a big quality difference overall. Mirahs song might be better preraid too, especially if youre using the hetoic strike macro that makes your oh not miss.
---
People have taken me as cat for 5-mans in my HotW/NS build and my stam/agi tank gear. I don't put out as much dps as a rogue would, but I can war stomp, throw out a heal, innervate, brez, and spot tank/heal if needed.    
---
Seeing as I'm not built or geared to do dps, I wouldn't even blame a group for wanting a different class to fill that role in a 5-man, but I'll be damned if anyone is corpse walking with this cat in thier group. I feel when I'm not tanking or healing, I can afford to stop dpsing for a second or two and use the full range of my kit as needed
---
Absolutely worth it! Fire spec for mage in pvp is also more gear dependent than frost.
---
Yeah me too...hard to believe this has been allowed to keep going on.
---
i'll take dueling a rogue over a spriest any day... they've got such a crazy kit
---
Yeah idk.

Especially with OP having "TV" in his name.

FuryProt Warrior is a hybrid. Reddit loves that.

We had people get saved in Onyxia when she was still up. It only happened to a few members and not the rest. Nothing was killed inside prior to them getting saved.

High pop servers will be a bloodbath. And it sill get old really quick when you cant do anything other then defend yourself

Or I pop retaliation
---
Seal of command still does extra damage while enemy player is stunned right? Try to use your mana to sustain the fight and when the enemy gets to around 30% maybe you can use stun + command judgement and get a couple lucky seal of command procs in the time window.
---
Just got back from holiday in Nice it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be 😀 But I have no idea what to suggest to you may be there a French version of LFG or come over to a English server
---
Yeah true, did that for the start bit mostly. But only if I had like 4+ quests for that particular dungeon. So basically deadmines, stockades, gnomeregan.
---
That’s a negative

I've got a holydin at level 31, and I've been having a pretty great time in pvp. As others have noted, having a friend helps, but even without I think it's possible to do well.
---
But! You're 100% right that you don't have much burst. You have to start slow and steady. Auto them down with Seal of Crusader, heal yourself often, you'll outlast pretty much every opponent. Then, when they start to realize this is gonna be long and annoying, they'll try to disengage. THAT's when you Hammer of Justice them, into SoC judgement, apply that little bit of burst we do have, and then laugh at their surprise at getting killed by a class the internet told them was weak.
---
Premades vs premades were pretty organised required teamwork , coordination , knowing your class to the max.We didn't farm kills takes way too long we farmed quick WSG and AB wins.
---
Possible to do it the way you said it as well but thats why it takes so long
---
Getting gladiator title in TBC days was a cakewalk, in comparison, especially in 2v2 brackets and according to certain 'flavour of the month' specs/combos. Just the amount of effort required to get gladiator in terms of time investment and coordinated human effort ... simply not comparable. To clear Naxx required 40 people to have their shit together; similarly a core group of 20 or so people had to be the very most hardcore on a server to monopolise the top PvP ranks. Playing 10 ladder matches a week or whatever in TBC to end up as a gladiator at the end of the season felt like a bad joke back then. In TBC nobody took gladiator as 'the more prestigious' title. The flying mounts were neat, though.
---
Seems legit.
---
There’s something about everything related to paladins in this game that’s so damn satisfying. I don’t even know why
---
Grats!
---
Yes it is, level 49 here.
---
Fuck, you're right. Damn I screwed the pooch on this one.
---
Not everyone else done all the content has that mind set. I've done all of vanilla almost had full T3 on my priest but I'm taking it slow and easy as hell. My shaman is just level 50. I've been taking my sweet ass time because I already know the end game so I don't really care about min/maxing. As many ppl point out all the early content can be done by ppl in greens, all these bis people are taking it too seriously (I mean if that's what's fun go ahead) but personally I'm going for all T1 first on my shammy even though it's not optimized bis. All about those a e s t h e t i c s. In the behalf of "hardcore" people some of us are just gonna chill and enjoy the experience because we've been there done that you know? Not trying to push progression personally anymore, just gonna take my time and enjoy the ride (:
---
Well, my guild is one that has a large group of people who cleared Naxx in vanilla.  Now, a guild full of Rank 14?  Probably not so much.
---
But you joke, we were clearing Naxx and MC was a cake walk.  We cleared MC with 23 people while we waited for everyone else in the guild to catch up leveling.  We run split Onyxias now to double loot acquisition. 
---
Sucks that you're raiding with a bunch of liars, sounds like a terrible guild to be in.
---
What’s the addon that tells me how long ‘till my spells expire.  I want to know when to rebanish elementals instead of guessing when it’s about to expire.
---
I literally don't tell anybody about my past experiences in order to either impress them when I kick ass or have an excuse when I do poorly. Always gotta set yourself up for success.
---
Pretty much. 
---
I've been leveling my priest shadow with the intention to heal and could pretty much choose whether I wanted to dps or heal 5 mans as I leveled.  Right now at 54 looking at soon doing end game dungeons and I see no need to quickly switch to a healing spec since I can find groups all the same as dps.
---
In my experience most are at least competent. Someone dedicating that much time to pvp SHOULD be into it and learn as they go. But I knew some awful rank 14 players back in vanilla. 
---
One was a mage who would always complain about how overpowered hunters are. I dueled him once. And he literally stood at range and tried to duke it out with me. Didnt try at all to exploit my deadzone. It blew my mind that someone who spent hundreds of hours pvping was so awful.
---
Ha, we called the house me and a few friends lived at in college Browntown.  Seeing your username just brought back some memories.
---
I do love fire/elemental spec for pvp. But it does seem more gear dependent. The burst damage is amazing but survivability is less and you are more squishy makes you also can cleans your dots or break gears with ice block. Frost seems to be the better choice for WSG when flag carrying.
---
It's horrible imo, there are point based systems that achieve the same without favoritism
---
Nah it definitely says spells and effects let's not pretend the tooltip is clear or logical it just doesn't work on bandages

If you read my original post our system is more of a round robin that a council. The council just oversee this is kept on top of and fair.
---
I'm working on it. Check for an update next week.  kinda busy with my job atm
---
This all pertains to raids except the last paragraph. Warriors and Druids have higher effective health (Armor X HP) in the gear available to them.  For Druids, this allows them to absorb crushes and crits without dying.  Warriors don't have as much EH as Druids, but they can negate crits with +Def gear and crushes through their Shield Block ability, so they take less damage.
---
Paladins can't push crushing blows off the attack table, and I'm not even sure they can hit the +Def target of 440 to eliminate crits (someone out there probably has a table that gets you close).  Basically, gear is just poorly itemized to support Paladins tanking raids, because this flies in the face of the class design.  All the plate tank gear in raids has +Str on it, which isn't nearly as good as Int.  IIRC Some of the non-set raid drops even have Class: Warrior on them (which is just unfair IMO).
---
None of this means you \*can't\* tank raids, but certain mechanics will be much more difficult with you as a tank.  Agro resets, enrage timers, etc. Word on the street is that Chris Metzen or someone on the design team had a lot to do with this.  They came from an Everquest background, and in that game, there was only one "real" raid tank, and they wanted hybrids (healers) to pay the hybrid tax, nerfing any raid role other than healing to a meme spec.  However, they "forgot" that with their design, DPS warriors could scale multiplicitavely at high gear levels, making them both the defacto tank and the best DPS in the game.  That's why like, half the population is warriors on private servers.
---
Now, dungeon boses can't crush, and the defense target to eliminate crits isn't as high since they're 62, not 63, nor as critical since the bosses don't hit as hard anyway so you can eat crits without dying.  So for those, especially since Paladin AOE tanking is EZ mode, you should be fine.
---
oh yeah im dumb thats what i meant lol nvm
---
Doing napkin math to see how a druid really does stand up to a warrior. What's your block value if you dont mind me asking?
---
I'm the generic 20/0/31 shadow priest, can out dps people on 1 to 3 targets (especially 3 targets when the tank can hold aggro for my dot spam) and can heal decently.
---
In 5 man dungeons shadow is even arguably better because if you time it right and mind blast a near dead mob, you get the spirit tap mana regeneration. Really useful in those oh crap scenarios when people pulled two groups of mobs.
---
It's mostly "I raided Naxx that shit was impossible and only elite players like me ever sniffed Sapphiron's butthole" while being mostly shit in Classic and complaining about everyone trying to be more efficient than they were 15 years ago. They will eventually take one of two paths and become "I always said Naxx was easy idk what you're talking about" or "This game is obviously nerfed and Blizzard fucked it up so noobs can play it."
---
That one guy in trade chat is pretty pissed lol
---
I wish rogues didn’t exist
---
You gonna eat that?
---
The burning steppes and winterspring ones were the worst for me. The one in the steppes kept attracting griefers from both factions plus the odd person trying to help. Using any sort of warning to not help me just attracted assholes. 
---
Winterspring was basically no griefers but since it's a long kite, you end up with people trying to help since it does look like you are in trouble.
---
So you spent hundreds of hours farming the same thing over and over. Meanwhile you are helping people with addictions? Huh... That's kinda funny.
---
I loved patchwerk, as a real gear check where everyone was on a faire fight compared to golemagg or vaelastraz.
---
But my most vivid memory was on thaddius, at around 1am, last try, where the GM yelled so hard when we killed The boss that his father entered in the room yelling that he was insane to do that much noise. I think he was around 22 or 23 at that time and was still living at his parent’s.
---
I feel this,  only got a foot in naxx by killing instructor and anub, and got to huhuran in aq, but that was all on a rogue when I was young.  Redoing and relearning these fights as a healer isn’t difficult, but I do have to learn mechanics I just ignored years ago.  I get surprised from time to time, like where to climb walls on the rag fight after being blown off the platform.
---
I gave it a try anyway yesterday using a hit and run (and then bandage) technique I saw a fury warrior do on YouTube but it seems that you're right and it's impossible for a prot warrior to realistically solo.
---
I'll look into tagging along with a farmer, thanks.
---
Thanks for the response!
---
Just need arcanist helm to drop
---
 We havent seen one yet! Got that star though!
---
Pom pyro is probably what I'm using once PVP and bgs are out
---
Deep enough to pick up AP, delete 1-2 characters instantly in the first WSG fight, and ride the momentum to keep them on farm status for the win
---
We're dirty alliance neckbeards, so no. A NE Priest, which imo may be even worse.
---
Agility enchant isn't available yet
---
6-7 days isnt realistic unless you've levelled several characters before.  The first time leveler takes 12-15 days on average
---
Mostly it's just DPS so you should maximize that as it's your selling point.
---
They are required in BWL for the suppression room and can interrupt or stun lock on fights where that is required.
---
Take engineering it gives the paladin a lot of flexibility they are missing. Dynamite is probably the best for any type of pulling because you only need to be in range and have los to start the throw. 
---
For example in deadmines. You can throw at vanclef and make it down the boat before it hits.
---
If you spend your time in ZF, then in BRD exp runs then 45-60 should be insanely fast compared to 1-44
---
For me my confusion was back in 2008 I bought wow the game no tbc as back then they were separate. So when I got to 60 playing just wow I classed that as “vanilla”, but it wasn’t until some time later I realised it wasn’t true vanilla but more tbc vanilla (I can’t even think what to call it) as I didn’t have the tbc expansion.
---
I think that was by far the average established guild experience in vanilla, yep. It was a notable server-event back then when someone killed Nefarian and guilds finally managed to get BWL on farm status. That was the real thing that sorted weekend warriors from hardcore players.
---
The catch-up content and revised talents made it comparatively trivial later on, but still.
---
BUT MUH PERSONAL LOOT!
---
On the contrary, people here seem not to dislike hybrids but dislike player notions that playing hybrids is not a detriment in any respect. It's honestly exhausting and this is coming from a Resto Shaman main. Hybrids are bad in raid unless you heal. They're much worse DPS and if you prefer playing a hybrid DPS then do you but don't act like the world is against you if I invite a Mage over you.
---
If you want to play Enhance Shaman then go ahead but when you look at the meters and see that someone is literally tripling your damage and bringing more utility than you then can you really complain about it?
---
Yea I smell bullshit.
---
I thought the same about PvE players. PvE players somehow were a bunch of uncool nerds in my mind. It's weird, I can't even think of why I thought that
---
They removed the ability to render in 3d space in wotlk because of a boss mod that drew on the ground.
---
You are downvoted because your comment is very dumb as it completely ignores that Bind on Equip Items are the same value to everyone and Bind on Pickup Items are vendor value to everyone who can't use it and much higher to those who can.
---
Now you know both why your comment was downvoted and why you should be needing on BoE epics.
---
i started grinding BRD Arena farms at 51. Good exp. Super easy runs, and chance to get a few BiS pieces.

Took me about 8 days without much rested xp.

You ca see my UI with keybids here. It is nothig special. Remember that you don't need all of your totems to be binded. Resistance totems, earthbind totem, "buffing totems" is easilly clickable for me. I only bind PvP totems like Grounding, Tremor (F; Shift + F), Magma, Fire Nova (5; Shift + 5), Sering Totem (max rank - 6 key; Rank 1 - Shift + 6) and Stoneclaw as it is useful for rogues and druids (max rank - F4; Rank 1 - Shift + F4).
---
I have also binded in one button (with modifier): Hearthstone + Ancestrall Recall, Ghost Wolf + Mount, Mana Spring + Healing Stream. Same goes for healing and damaging spells. I am just using modifiers: shift, alt and nomod.
---
As far for now and I am okay with it. Haven't got any problems in PvP, neither in PvE.
---
For some reason on my server living essence were selling for 90s or 1g on the AH, so I bought 40 of them.  Are these more easily farmable now and will stay cheap or do you think the price will go back up?   I used basically all my money buying these and there were still around 10 more selling on the AH for under 1g50s but I didn't have the money to buy them.
---
I hit 60 maybe a little bit less than a year out from TBC. I did some pvp maybe to rank 4 or 5 and dungeons, and raided MC, ony, and ZG a small handful of times. 
---
Though when I raided those it was with an irl friends guild that just carried me through them, as they were progressing in naxx or aq at the time. Don’t think I ever got loot either. Which was fine, I just liked to play. 
---
So I don’t really tell people I have actual raid experience in vanilla, but more so raid exposure ha.
---
well then that doesn't answer the question
---
Did try that actually and for me the pet respawned.
---
his mental age
---
Nah we do weekly pizza raffles the same way. If you win you get a pizza ordered online for you by the guild leader provided you take a picture of it arriving at your door. Everyone is pretty chill about passing gear too so there's no real issue atm. We just smash the raids that are out Tuesday night then do w/e the rest of the week.
---
The last 140 alliance players on that server
---
Just get logs. You'll figure out whose worth a damn after a few raids.
---
An hour for a group? I guess fewer groups are running now than were going even a few weeks ago, but I'm always waiting on a tank it seems. I like prot paladins just fine...but I prefer they spec prot, and I also prefer they not try Armory at level 34, but y'know...beggars can't be choosers...

At 54 I would tank BRD runs till 58, then switch to LBRS. You’ll get a good amount of gear that are prebis at 60. A few pieces that are BiS till phase 5 like sgc and HoJ
---
Every single boss with an enrage or escalating damage mechanic is a dps check. Saying that you had to have a certain raid dps for a boss deep in a raid doesn't stop the first boss in the raid dungeon from also being a dps check. And considering that for patchwerk, all the descriptions were/are he's a meatbag that hits hard with shit tons of hp and your raid has to be able to output X dps to kill him. Certainly sounds like a dps check to me?
---
Maybe the OPs idea is that once you got passed Patchwerk he doesn't count and your raid experience becomes centered around loatheb? Psychology of completion vs failure I guess which might be an indicator of experience inside naxx, course some might have thought loatheb was easy becuase they struggled more on 4h or something
---
I actually raided Naxx during vanilla one time. Well, half a time. 
---
I mained a hunter but there was only one guild on our server doing any decent progress in Naxx, and it was an Australian guild that raided at like 3am-6am my time (They were called Nazgul on Proudmoore).
---
I was 16 at the time and I really wanted to see Naxx. But they didn't need hunters, all they needed was a resto druid. So I bought an AQ geared resto druid account off ebay with all the money I had made working at the grocery store that summer, and I apped to their guild.
---
Unfortunately, I didn't actually know how to play resto druid, and I'm not sure exactly what I was thinking that made me so confident I would get away with this. Plus I was in high school, and raiding 3am-7am on weekdays was a really stupid idea. Anyways, I get in for the first raid, we head to Patchwerk, and they realize very quickly that I have no fucking idea what I'm doing on a resto druid. 
---
They raid and guild kicked me the first night, and I resold the druid account in shame.
---
Anyways, if anyone has the right to tell people they raided naxx in vanilla for the epeen it's me!
---
I remember a juicy guild drama on my server back in WLK when an unskilled player gets appointed guild officer and has priority on all the best loots. Turns out she's been sleeping with the guild master so therefore the special treatment.
---
One of the fun things back in the heyday of WoW was enjoying a bowl of popcorn and watching the drama unfold.
---
W'ere all murderous psychopaths, but because we're murderous psychopaths working for the good guys, its all good
---
Well at least you can lose a couple hit pieces
---
If your raid leader is decent and people come reasonably prepared you'll clear it 1or 2weeks
---
It's that easy, except far Onyxie she seems to be extremely random all depends on how fast she will be agroes by any tank
---
I got the mace on the shear realization that mage-blade was going to be so hotly contested. Mace looks cool and is only down 7 healing from the BRD mace, plus mp5, stam and int. I'll throw +55 healing on it and call it a day.
---
Would you be able to give me a kind of idea on what type of runs I might be able to do in BRD as a low 50's tank? Probably not EMP runs.
---
&gt; low skill
---
Is he forgetting to auto attack?
---
Depends on the server. I see lots of raids and guilds looking for healers.
---
I never did Nax in Vanilla.
---
You monsters. That is even worse than drowning a gnome with mind control.
---
Seems like he assumes that he gets one every 4th run which isn't true at all..
---
Same with priest in NW EPL where no mobs/quests are normally (besides termites).
---
The quest was easy, keeping people away was hard.
---
I've been a hardcore raider in Vanilla. We have cleared Naxx before patch 2.0 and continued to be a top progression guild worldwide in TBC. I can't remember shit in Molten Core. 
---
The difference? I don't tell people how to play the game or even think I'd be better at this game given this whole period was about 15 years ago. I know jack shit nowadays. Dual wield fury tanking? Yeah sure, what?
---
I bought a few green +healing pieces from the AH while leveling. You can easily get +100 healing with 3-4 pieces. That made healing a lot easier. Once you're level 55+ you just have to spam the higher level dungeons.
---
I spot Grob Mob guilds 👀

Yea they drop quite often in DM:east.
---
Isn't the helm from SM Cath better though?
---
it's been a pug group that recently turned into a guild in the last week.
---
Did they make like 5 of these?
---
There's a pretty high drop rate from some mobs in DM so the price probably won't get much higher.
---
We raid with 8 mages. I kinda understand, but still, you're doing it for not just you, but the entire guild
---
Best advertisement I’ve seen to date.
---
&gt; gets passed
---
loot council?
---
I started laughing alone in my office.  Very funny. Thank you
---
granted, but all chests in game are locked
---
I love my druid. Gonna statt another when i get my new potato soon. Gonna co level a lock
---
You know that you can restore items right
---
Ah, yeah true
---
Claiming 2k DPS is a little disingenuous IMO. Those parses are for encounters that last 20 seconds or less leading to ridiculous uptime figures on things like recklessness and adrenaline rush. Highly skewed.
---
On my server, I got mine for 250g and 300g.
---
It's a PvE server tho and you won't find a better PvP Ring due to how OP the Proc is.
---
Don't need to delete the card, you can switch anyways. Though the card will waste 1 space so you can delete it anyways.
---
Don't need to do the quest for the other specialisation, the book directly gives you it
---
You want to use bloodthirst and whirlwind on cool down, and only HS when you are nearing rage cap.
---
The comment to which I replied is talking about pug dungeons which I assume is 5-mans. In which case healers are definitely not in huge demand, but I agree they certainly are for raids.
---
Good luck killing world bosses. If you aren't in the top 5% of guilds on your server you will never kill it until those guilds literally don't need it anymore.
---
what combat text addon is that?
---
*once*???
---
No doubt.
---
Suck my dick how about that then
---
he's over here playin 4d woosh
---
This is awesome.
---
Murlocs are always decent.  At that level you may even be getting golden pearls from the clams.
---
To expand, ribbly in brd bar, start encounter, Sprint upstairs and jump on the ledge behind plugger. The adds get confused but ribbly comes up alone, easy solo and drops 16 slot bag.
---
Then plugger. Pick up beers on the bar and drop at the corner between plugger and thorium bro. Each beer lures one bar patron alone for you to kill. Repeat until plugger is alone. From there, you can either full out DPS rush, or you can line of sight his casts around that same corner for easy kills. Drops bar shank dagger and mixo tunic. 
---
Back to 3 rogues, after angerforge you can kill brewmaster in bar. Summon, stealth, sap one, easy DPS rush with 3 combat rogues. Drops eye patch and mace.
---
Then council of 7, really easy with 3 rogues. Watch aggro, bandage, no problem. Ghostshroud drops.
---
ALSO, angerforge can be two manned with rogues, at least one combat. Bust the cooldowns and kite him to the bank of the stairs, in the corner. Between vanish or attention to aggro, he'll die before your two evasions are up. Adds get confused and take a little longer to arrive, giving you the time you need for kill and loot. It's slightly harder to both survive at the end if one had to vanish for aggro, but it's still possible.
---
This is just BRD, and it's not comprehensive. Share that spreadsheet. This community needs a good stealth run resource.
---
&gt; Y’all always welcome in my groups, especially since you’re likely not to compete with me for drops lol.
---
Sorry to break it to you, but just because I’m tanking, I still want your cloth healing gear for raids... I just feel slightly bad about it.
---
The late game herbs sell for 12-15g a stack on my server, I'm sitting at 400g from herb and skinning and I am only 59.  The money will definitely come.
---
Yeah, DPS war can tank the majority of the content. But they can and will be blown up by late game content. I have seen a fury war, near all bis, get blown up by like 3 hits to trash in Strat UD. Wearing 5 pieces of leather will do that
---
What is powershifting exactly for feral druids and how important is it? I'm only lvl 20 so don't really understand it.
---
Also, I read this guide that said Wolfshead Helm is the best helmet for feral druid even at lvl 60, is that true? 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=8345/wolfshead-helm
---
That's what i said to your sister after she gave me head yesterday
---
Similar to a shadow priest
---
I've been playing WoW for well over 10 years, this whole need all epic BoEs has never existed. I've always seen the rule of need before greed on epic BoEs in all expacs, until personal loot was implemented. As I said just find the greedyness of all need as toxic, justy own opinion.
---
It's so funny man, to this day kills me!
---
The real money is in the end game zones. Dreamfoil, plaguebloom and black lotus fetch a good price.
---
Yep, that’s why I stopped tanking 5-mans
---
nobody NEEDS addons
---
Warrior is also a hybrid class.
---
Idk bout yall but my druid is a chaotic evil son-of-a-b*tch.
---
Even intra-alliance racism again gnomes is pretty severe.
---
Yeah, no one messes with my Banshee Queen.
---
Yeah it was fake.  A known youtube prank channel.  That said, it still creases me up when he rams the remote control up his ass.  Funnier when you don't know its fake though.
---
What little bar?  The one labeled DPS?  That's Details I believe
---
Legendary Meta
---
Does he have a guide or video about this build?
---
Good point about imp execute. I kinda had my doubts about SS because of low 1h dmg. 2h it's fuckin insane tho. Probably worth picking up BT then
---
Never seen this on the sub ONCE. And i am constantly on here every day.
---
I raid as shadow with my guild and i'm top 5'ing almost every boss in MC. Once I get Anathema i'm going to be breaking 500 dps on some fights. Shadow is in an awesome spot right now. I'm not looking forward to the day where I lose my shadow word: pain debuff slot to a more useful debuff though. Granted, it's many phases in to the future.
---
Story time guys.  
---
I was out in felwood, trying to farm essence of water.  
---
I was killed by 4 alliance players 3 to 4 times and alt+F4 to relax for a bit.  
---
I log in later that evening. These alliance scum are gone. I revive, summon my succubus, set Soulstone and all the fancy stuff.  
---
I have quite some raiding gear, so I usually can life tap myself almost to 1 health and have full mana, I am a cheap fuck and use the apples you get from the inn. I sit down.  
---
A gnome mage. In front of me. Waving at me.  
---
He could have literally wanded me and I'd be oneshot down.  
---
I felt so relieved and so happy. My faith to the alliance was restored a little bit.  
---
I have full HP. I stand up. Wand the gnome once.  
---
The gnome wanda back.  
---
Now guys, remember the picture from OP?  
---
I want to mount up and hear a rogue. Hes attacking the mage. Trying to gank her after she initiated an attack with an elemental.  
---
I stood there.. and honored the 1v1. No disturbance by me. The orc dies.  
---
I target the mage.  
---
Open chat.  
---
Write /shrug.  
---
And continue my way.  
---
Sorry buddy. But you initiated the fight, Im not gonna kill the gnome mage who spared my life a minute ago.
---
Yeah, don't feel bad. My original class was hunter, but I've mostly mained healers since Wrath, so I wanted to go back to DPS. Played a lot on my original mage in Legion when the game got boring and I had to start farming reps and stuff, and decided mage was my classic class.
---
Regret it. Wish I had rolled a holy pally instead. I'm not the best dps, though I'd say I'm pretty okay and quick on sheeping and stuff. I miss healing, though, and every time I make a mistake I feel like I'm contributing to the idiot mage memes.
---
So, to all the hunters out there who clear DM tribute solo- I got a question.
---
I have been doing it solo and do it pretty well, BUT I am running into one problem i simply cannot figure out. For the boss fight i am running into an odd boss interaction. When im mid fight and have them run from pet down to me, after I Feign. Ill stand back up and then resume the fight. This works like 99% of the time. But there is 1% where i will feign (and its not resisted), the bosses will then turn and run back to attack my pet. I will stand back up and then the boss-- Often King but sometimes caster-- Will simply.. Stop targeting my pet, turn and run back to attack me. To my knowledge I do nothing to generate agro but he still randomly decides he wants my ass. Do you all have this happen? I dont know if it could be threat generated by TSA possibly being applied to my pet  (dont think that causes threat). The thing i think i may do is after the initial pull, ill have my pet run and melee the king a few times as i pull him from top back down. So id generate 2-3 extra hits of threat on  my pet. I am thinking part of the issue is caused by on the pull i have my pet target the caster and then dash out- causing the only threat the king has to my pet being the pets body agro.
---
I started playing on my own at 11 years old (launch of vanilla) and it’s annoying that so many people assume I only got into because of a man “teaching” or showing me lol. :(
---
Awww shame man, you’re welcome to just hang out with us lol https://discord.gg/kEMrkbs
---
imo the only necessary requirement for being an officer is being honest, reliable, and have a good judge of character.
---
an officer can be terrible at WoW, but if they are a good dependable person then they will make a good officer.
---
Mtx
---
Hmmm which murlocs are you talking about
---
For humans with swords yes, but that doesn't mean hit is useless. It still provides great added DPS.
---
Any greeder here? LUL
---
Scarlet Crusade Raid.
---
&gt;Hack slash die
---
Hack slash ~~die~~ vanish
---
Thanks for the heads up
---
Yup, we’ve got like... 3
---
Lol, I am the guild spriest and i got anathema second. I wouldn't say we do nothing in raids you're mistaken, how many locks are in raid, 15% damage increase is huge. I also take over dispelling to allow others more healing uptime. Spriests offer more than you think, it's beneficial to have one.
---
It only takes seconds to secure a win though
---
I understand exactly why it's so overwhelmingly popular
---
Should I equip Hands of Power or Felcloth Gloves as a Warlock?
---
I bid 75g on Felcloth Gloves and then RIGHT AFTER Hands of Power dropped in LBRS (of course lmao).
---
Should I flip the Felcloth Gloves for some cash or equip them? I'm looking at the stats and they seem objectively better.
---
I still don't understand. There's still no context. Did loot drop and he wasn't allowed to roll on it, or did loot just not drop and he was mad and gquit?
---
I dunno man that's a lot of black lotus. Are you sure you aren't beyond help? Lol
---
If the boss is on farm, why do you need the optimal raid group?
---
Nothing annoys me more when the guild leader doesn't assign healing priorities. Last raid I was in, full guild run, they kept saying, just heal whoever is lowest. It was so annoying. When I tried to step up and assign healing targets I kept getting silenced.
---
If it keeps up like this I'm switching guilds. It's infuriating as a druid when all my heals are getting sniped and all my hots are getting overwritten.
---
"make sure they use every bit of my bodyyyyy..."
---
Same XD. Did an onyxia pug the other day and we he invited a THIRD druid i lost my mind. Didnt say anything and still did the raid. But to our defense we get tier loot quick but when it comes to the rest we are low priority on like everything
---
It’s even worse when it goes to people who didn’t take the time to farm prebis
---
And people only tend to post odd rolls to reddit. We're only seeing a very small percentage of all gear rolls in classic.
---
&gt;  I am at 2 action bars at 10 buttons each 
---
How do you play a mage with that little available? I have three bars of 12 hotkeyed, and another two on the side (mostly) not.
---
Our guild one shot up to Rag on Tuesday with a feral druid topping charts. Then cleared Rag on Thursday with the same group. Maybe you need to care later in the game but right now I don't see any reason to feel pressured into a spec.
---
No, best exp gain at that level is anarchy in melee cleave. So not tanking.
---
Druid hits 60 as feral.
---
Respecs resto.
---
Enters mc pug.
---
Collects 6 tier pieces.
---
Disappears after 2 weeks.
---
Is auctioneer currently supported on classic? couldn't find it on Twitch
---
In the bathtub. As is customary.
---
Good to know you are finding a nice community, but it still doesn’t hide the fact that drama-inducing and psychotic people join the RP-PvP servers, if you just look into r/Grobbulus. These are not random joe-schmoes but people who can have a large influence on the server as a whole. They and their guilds are the brunt of drama as far back when Grobbulus launched.
---
Lol except at PvP. Where you get shit on constantly
---
No. Healing power gives you the same amount of extra healing per cast whether you cast rank 5 Healing Touch or rank 10 Healing Touch. You can more than double the power of your rank 5 Healing Touch with bonus healing, while at the same time only increasing the power of your max rank Healing Touch by ~20%. Bonus healing is significantly stronger (relativley speaking) when you downrank and when fights last a long time (because you cast more spells).
---
On the other hand, 1 intellect is always 15 mana. That doesn't change whether the fight is 1 minute long or 10 minutes long. 15 mana is much more valuable on a 1 minute fight than a 10 minute fight, therefore intellect is stronger on short fights than long fights.
---
The "BiS" dungeon blues have almost all bonus healing and very little stamina/intellect/spirit/regen. T1 is much more balanced. I prefer T1 in this content.
---
I think you are missing the point of the post. Of course there are people who raided Naxx and may not remember how MC works. Shit I only raided MC/BWL and I don't remember how a lot of MC works. What OP is saying is that a large portion of people just say it now to gain fake credibility because it's pretty difficult to disprove since all the mechanics are written up online and you can just make up a story about it and reference a fight from a tutorial and you are golden..
---
Like he said, it seems like it's harder to meet a first time WoW player than it is a world first, rank 14, naxx clearer these days which is crazy. Odds are a large portion of that group of people are telling fibs to seem more appealing as a raider or garner some fake respect from their fellow guild/groupmates.
---
I was rank 13, because rank 14 was tedious to get after cross realm and before that without controlling the entire pvp guilds on your side.
---
Naxx wasn't that hard, but information was scarce back in the days and the period to raid was very short. As a result, we got to Thaddius and we even downed him once.
---
To be fair I usually only rejuv tanks and warlocks for the reason of not worth since other healers snipe.  But having clear assignments is a must
---
A man of culture I see
---
Or flights
---
I watched horde try to retaliate in Stormwind. That didn’t go well for horde
---
Lol assuming I'm gen z? I'm in my 30s man, also if a frozen band dropped in my group and the mage needed it I would give him a big FAT grats and let him have it hope the others in group would too. When you approach it like this it's not greedy, it's helping out your group members. Having everyone go OMG a BoE I need to need for gold fuck that guy that can use it is greedy as hell.
---
That requires a source. Because it's not. I'll gladly take those words back if you can prove it.
---
We only use resto 1 druid per raid. 4 paladin, 4 priest, 1 druid.
---
Sounds like a dire maul run I did. We get to the last boss and before we start an enemy aggros and we fight and kill it and the stockades drop. The main tank was freaking out and wanted it and everybody was so chill and said sure man it’s all yours. Everyone passed and he needed. It’s just a matter of who’s in your group and if it’s guildies or not.
---
Naxx was wraith
---
He typed guilde though.
---
Correct.
---
Cat for Solo &amp; PvP - Bite, Claw, Dash, Growl, 90 frost, arcane and of point in rest in nature.
---
Wolf for Dungeons &amp; Raids - Furious Howl, Bite, 90 fire, shadow and rest in stamina.
---
I very nearly was put off of playing druid because of all the people saying how bad it is in classic. I'm glad I decided to play one anyways because it's a blast. I don't feel gimped. Am I going to be main tanking every raid boss, probably not. But is the option there to do many of them, yes. I am confident if I wanted to dps in raids I could find a spot. I know I can easily get in as a healer. If you watch old vanilla videos, actual vanilla, not PS, you'll see how bad people were at the game. Keyboard turning, clickers, terrible optimisation. Look at how quickly people are burning through content now. I think we are going to see a whole lot more "less optimal" specs than we did before because people are a lot better at the game in general. And in wpvp, holy shit does druid have an expansive kit of you just use it.
---
Alliance bad.
---
Does any of these scenarios change anything with the initial point?
---
It doesn't, greed is greed.
---
Eh maidens ok the org one is just as good
---
I was in a full time raid guild running split MC farm, BWL farm, ZG20, AQ20, and AQ40 progression competing for server first (horde) kills. We hit a wall in AQ40 and were on C'thun when Naxx40 came out - majority of guild completely was burned out and quit, people server xfered etc.  
---
So based off my experience, it wouldn't surprise me to find people who raided naxx in vanilla having no experience with MC or BWL progression. All of our earlier tier progression raiders were completely burned when Naxx dropped =). I wouldn't be surprised if the majority of people who did that content only experienced it when it was on complete farm.
---
Don't obsess over finishing instance quests, just prioritize the ones that give rewards you want and forget about the rest.  This happens a lot while leveling really, and at some point it's not worth to do the instance anymore.  Create a bank alt and mail all of your excess materials to him/her.  This will free up a ton of space in your bank.  
---
This game is really a "sandbox" and you should just do whatever you feel like doing.  ZF, tanaris, ferelas, hinterlands, searing gorge are where you should live for the next few levels until your early 50's, then go to un'goro.
---
How do you get Onyxia buff?
---
It’s highly situational.  If you’re just raiding/farming, you don’t need all of the niche abilities that are rarely, if ever, used.
---
I camped tidal charm every night for 2 weeks on Gehennas server. Finally got it and it was worth every second! A warlock that can stun - insane lol! 
---
Make sure you got the addon Unit Scan which notifies you when he spawn.
---
Here was my l33t general purpose pvp build for shaman:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/0503315-05052001-0503205100401
---
Trash in raid but having shock cooldown, NS, and 2h weapons let me pretty much 1v1 any class.
---
My /played is a bit out of whack from fishing so much. Sometimes me and my friends just sit in voice chat and talk shit, drink beer, and fish for a couple hours when the "grind" is getting old or we're kinda drunk or tired. It's good fun but that time can add up quick. The gold is nice though, especially on raid nights when people are buying stacks of squids and nightfins
---
Please post a video of you doing  aoe farming without getting hit, especially how crazy the melee distance in classic is. Don't post a priv server video, they are not what live classic is.
---
Yeah my mistake
---
Only if there's no shaman near by wise too your plans.
---
Im playing oomkin. I constantly outdps warlocks and hunters (and some cases even mages).
---
And for tougher fights where its relevant i bring combat ress, innervate, off-healing and a crit buff for the casters in my group.
---
Mirahs song. Yellow hit cap is off MH so as long as you have an axe there you gain most of the benefit from the 305 wep skill.
---
Wait. So you are melee group leading and main tanking AQ40 when you were like, 12?
---
Bet you never fought anyone that was bigger than you. You are the nancy
---
I wish that players could not reset instances 5 times an hour to make people run whole dungeons and not use them as an item/cash farm  
---
Granted 90% of hunters, mages and locks would vanish.
---
Leaves you salty.
---
&gt; automate that switch
---
Literally your words lmfao, automating stuff is the definition of bottling.
---
It's a nice place. Don't come here cause you'll stink it all up.
---
I'll be fine with DFT/Jom Gabbar until then. I would like to see your numbers explaining what "by far the best" means. The other rogues in my guild that I out DPS don't seem to be getting that "by far the best" value.
---
Feralas-Tanaris-Searing Gorge-Hinterlands is the route I followed while leveling.  You are the right level to get into ZF runs right now, so get to Tanaris and collect all the quests for ZF. 
---
You'll definitely want to get the elite trolls quest completed in Hinterlands as soon as you're 48-49, it gives you Rune of the Guard Captain which is a huge upgrade.
---
Personally I wouldnt bother finishing Uldaman, it's long, painful and pretty bad XP because the first half of the instance is level 38-41 mobs
---
I don't think the Undead are evil at all. Every undead has *died*. They kicked the can. They've seen beyond the veil. Now, they're back and in a weird position. Like, they know the body doesn't matter once somethings dead, because they know what it's like. They have an entirely new perspective on life, death, and happiness that others in Azeroth just can't comprehend.
---
What level would you recommend mara and brd for a warrior? I'm just now hitting lvl 50 and have been doing ZF runs still.
---
I love pizza trays. They're perfect for putting my pizza instead of keyboards on. My current desk doesn't have one and it makes me sad.
---
you're almost as bad as that "homo in &lt;yojimbo forever&gt;"
---
I recommend keeping a rank 1 cone of cold on your bar to save mana
---
i do this to but mostly because it's more fun and roguelike. time save is whatever.
---
I'm half inclined to think you made this dwarf just to fulfill your dream of being "accidentally" attacked.
---
(900/5)/24 = 7.5 days played to get the mount ... ouch
---
I just don't understand why you're not providing context lol. And yes of course it changes things lol, one scenario he could have a legitimate argument depending on some stuff, and the other he's 100% stupid.
---
Back in the day, I would solo the Fire Elemental boss and the Barman Shanker guy in BRD.

If you have a Druid friend and a few rogue buddies, you can do stealth runs for the wolf boss in LBRS and Rattlegore in Scholo. Rattle hits really hard, but he is stunnable.
---
People always seem shocked when I tell them I didn't play Vanilla and my first raiding experience was SSC when I was in my mid 20s.
---
You'd be surprised, well honestly, maybe you wouldn't, at the amount of people who think druids simply cant tank. I've been kicked out of multiple UBRS before we even start, and in MC i'm kinda the "pick up loose adds" tank often.  Crushing blows do exist, but they really arent that devastating (we'll also take more crits than youall).

Threw that together (doubt it will take super long for someone to mess it up, it's a copy) but im showing: (counting armor, hp, dodge,parry,miss, your 10% damage reduction from your stance, my 15% chance for =50% damage, crits and both of our defense raiting, NOT counting block)  
---
I have 18,301 ehp unbuffed, and 33,808 buffed  
---
You have 16,347 unbuffed and 23,874 buffed  
---
of course i'd be more spikey and have no real cooldowns for if stuff goes wrong. Biggest part though is you have multiple upgrades in raids right now, I dont (only real upgrade in phase 1 raids over prebis is the ony neck). I am still lacking breastplate of bloodthirst technically towards prebis
---
Oh Oh! I know the answer to this one. Weapon damage doesn't matter for a druid, so 50% increased attack speed is stupid strong. Also, the utility of extra energy from the helm let's you do more damage than a few stats would. 
---
Side note, semi-related, does anyone know of an add-on that would let me see my mana while in cat form? It would be very nice to know if I actually have the mana to powershift.
---
This, the programs would be like mouse recorder where you can record certain functions like if i setup to hold w for 3 seconds then jump twice every 4 minutes  to keep me from going afk, is against TOS, but have a keybound macro that you manually press is not against tos.
---
Female nelfs are super cute too 
---
Miss mine
---
They ain't doing Classic+. Period. TBC incoming for good.
---
Cut back on druids.  There's little reason to run more than 2 druid healers
---
Vanilla player here, I only made it to BWL, but couldn't kill Nef...I also only made like Rank 4 PvP.
---
Then its your leaders responsibility to give clarification and transparency of how loot is being distributed.  
---
I knew that some people would get upset if they dont got loot, there are alot of new people who dont know how to equip a 40 person raid equally.  
---
So I made an example as warlock class leader and skipped 3 IDs worth of loot. As I got T2 legs and an offhand in our pugraids, when we couldnt fill the raid in the first three IDs.  
---
We now fill almost 2 raids. The loot drops anyways sooner or later. So I geared everyone who hit currently 60, so that everyone had 2 items.  
---
I wrote over 3 pages in DIN A4, how I handle loot. How I handle rotations. What influences my decisions, how I justify who gets which item first. And what my roles as classleader are.  
---
Then I gave them an example, by writing out how the next three casteritems are being distributed. If one of the drops.  
---
I am the first person to rotate, I am the first person to pass on items. Just to prove my point, that I want the best for all warlocks and even if I have to sit out one ID and go pugging or ask our partner raid, if they can make me tag along. Just so the ID doesnt go to waste. They see it first hand by the classleader and follow lead.  
---
You cant lead a raid and say: "Alright. We have 7 warlocks, but only 5 people can join in the raids. I am classleader. So I will always have the right to be in the Raid."  
---
Not everyone is going to do chores that the leader wont even do himself. But set a good example and be transparent and they will trust you in everything you do.
---
yea too many people fall into the mindset of "if its not the best its the worst" and its pretty dumb
---
My 2 fav videos are still the 50dkp minus/raging raid leader video and the internet is for porn video.
---
Nonsense. Tie rolls should force an immediate duel there and then. Winner takes all, unless they forget to /violin, then the loser gets it.
---
I made my warlock a human and mage a gnome, and kind of regret not doing it the other way around.
---
Great thing about being a gnome warlock is you dont have to deal with the stupid gearchicken mount.
---
druids have pretty strong farm right now, they can aoe in felwood, dm e farm, trib farm solo or duo with a rogue, tank dungeons for gold, etc
---
Strat UD is also where the prebis hat drops and almost no other cloth gear, would be more rare to see a mage going there with something other than whitemane
---
I have no idea what the problem could be - but I just wanted to say that I'm happy it can still be done.  On Monday people were saying it got hot fixed and is now much more difficult/impossible.
---
Oooof a mage without a wand to disarm grounding
---
You hate to see it, but they exist
---
Its called confirmation bias.
---
I call bullshit. Deathcharger's Reins doesn't actually exist in this plane of reality.
---
Edit: Words
---
And typically with a numbers advantage, health advantage, or significant level advantage!
---
I'm sure it's the same for alliance, but I can't count how many times I've seen a horde mid fight or low health and passed them by only to get ganked by them minutes later when I'm mid fight or their friend has shown up or both.
---
Lol yeah definitely outliers, especially on a game like WoW classic, takes a lot of dedication. Nothing no casual could do 😄
---
I'm only level 51 so I'm not even raiding yet but from what I read about groups that are raiding is that shadow priests are basically just there to keep Shadow Weaving up and aren't allowed to use basically any of their spells because almost everything uses a debuff slot. That's why I started a mage. I figure if I ever get to raiding I can actually play my spec.
---
lmao. generalizations like this are stupid, for any class. there are shitty people regardless who play literally anything
---
Piggyback on this question, how do people feel about seal date daggers when you're rocking 305+ dagger skill from DM items or the gloves in MC? I ran this in Vanilla and pulled top DPS in raids, but it's generally accepted people weren't as good back then. How does it stack up now?
---
She resets on a schedule.  It's not dynamic from when you kill her.
---
For example last week she reset between Wednesday and Thursday so we killed her on both nights.
---
The esfand method of screaming for power infusions and innvervates to be like 5th on the meters.
---
AQ will require a bit of optimization 😉
---
&gt; I am just going to correct you here
---
Sorry I didn't read the rest. I know what you are going to read and it's crap. Your doomcalling was wrong about MC, and will be wrong about anything that follows. And I will not give you any attention because you will never come back and admit you were wrong when people clear the rest like it's nothing.
---
TFW you find a save princess run party in BRD.
---
No we are talking about over 2-4x the dps when comparing ret and fury.
---
He knows there’s some great opportunity *right* in front of him... he just can’t quite figure it out.
---
Math is hard. If he's 36 years old now that means he was 21 years old at the start of vanilla.
---
DKP isn't an issue if I end up raiding and continuing to raid with my current guild as it's a different system. Sounds like Scholo is the way to go.
---
Thank you.
---
What is a +1 loot system?
---
I didn't do the math, unfortunately, but maybe 10 or so SP per crit point would be adequate?
---
&gt;I really think in vanilla paladins were designed to tank/healer hybrid.
---
They were meant to be healers, first and foremost, that could kinda/sorta do other things at the same time, ergo "hybrid".  This is why almost all their tier sets and class-specific items have a healing slant to them.  Even Verigan's Fist, two-handed mace though it may be, has caster stats.  I believe their intention was that your primary role would be to heal, but that you could also do some DPS at the same time or off-tank some adds.  Of course, with the right build and dedication, Paladin can perform those roles outright, but it takes a lot more effort than the classes meant for them.
---
I mean, it's in Horde territory with a major city a 2 minute run away.
---
Im just finishing my second 60 warrior after moving servers.  It took me 30 days to hit 60 the first time, and today is 28 days with the second sitting at 58.6.  Hakurai on YouTube has a great guide for underpowered melee characters to help you stay on track doing quests you can actually complete efficiently.  40 to 50 feels way longer and much less efficient than 50-60 imo.  Stick with it
---
Edit: not sure on time played for the first one as I spent alot of time online to avoid queues,  but I'm about 10 days on the second right now.
---
We have a ret pally in the guild that's usually top 5.  Dude just sounds bad if he's below the tank.
---
/https://reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dmedlp/list_of_servers_by_guild_mc_clears_eu/
---
on here Dreadmist has 10 guilds and top are at 80. 
---
Feels to me empty in a sense that, if it takes long to find groups for wc and such and only 10 guilds clearing MC it sounds „empty“. main cities are always pretty livly indeed.
---
It's my very old laptop from 2010. Trying to get by using it til I can get back to my good machine!
---
I was one of the lucky ones who ran a PVP group in Vanilla. I was a 16 year old with no life, no gf, and only real-life friends that would play WoW. I did make it to Rank 14, and I raided Naxx up until the first boss as a Fury Warrior.
---
Unless someone shows me screenshots of their Rank 14, or of their journey, I do no believe them. I saved all my progress screenshots from Rank 1 to Rank 14 as I journeyed through it all.  Nothing pisses me off more on WoW than a person lying about being Rank 14. Once you have gone through the grind for 14 hours per day for 6 months straight, you feel anger towards the liars. 
---
TLDR: Screenshots or it didn't happen
---
How long did the raid wait for him to stack threat lol
---
I mean nothing in games is really random, some just have better pseudo-random generation methods than others. Most simple random number generators will base the randomness off of the current timestamp which makes it easy to end up with duplicates. 
---
Plus like others said, confirmation bias.
---
You’re probably right. 
---
I’ve never done these raids when they were current content, so I don’t have a good gauge of the difficulty other than knowing only like 1% of guilds cleared Naxx.
---
It do be like that. I see the rogue popping blade flurry and adrenalin rush thinking I will never catch them. Pop deathwish and cloudkeeper AP buff in the last 30seconds of the fight to squeeze past the top rogue by 0,2%. Always  close!
---
I know I'm just saying!
---
I don't understand how they want you to have 100% HoT uptime and not run out of mana? Rejuvenate only lasts what? 10-12 seconds?
---
Oh shit, wish I knew this was happening last night.
---
Around what time eastern?
---
Curious OP what was the item and what did it replace?
---
That is impressive, I'm guessing, warrior, druid/priest, and lock?
---
Sheets had just been washed. If you mean make it look nice and tucked in. No chance. I don't see a need to impress someone with a made bed.
---
Then you've just not actually raided, MC might be easy enough to last but just wait for aq40 &amp; nax,..
---
Also.. greater mana potions?  lol  plus, not using protection pots mid fight? aight nice useful class. 
---
"No reason to go oom" except your spells cost a shit ton of mana because of balance.
---
The only good way for elemental shamans to exist is to downrank dmg spells and you can actually stay at healthy mana through a fight if you know exactly which rank you should use.
---
Mana classes that don't have great mana regen abilities weigh int slightly diff than for us locks/mages
---
If you go deep enough into Frost to get Cold Snap and IB you're more of an elemental hybrid than a deep fire mage.  
---
Not every class is going to have a purge or dispel to throw at you so Ice Barrier is still going to be insanely useful in 90% of fights. 
---
&gt; The second you try to do anything other than jump around waiting on CoC and fireblast cooldowns is try to cast a frostbolt &amp; get instantly interrupted because everyone knows that puts all your survivability on lockout, leaving you completely useless. 
---
Frost nova, Arcane Explosion, downranked frostbolts, Blinking LoS: there isn't really a lot of down time with Frost PvP. And, again, not every class or every fight is going to leave you open to interrupts. If a rotation of CoC&gt;Nova&gt;Fireblast&gt;AE&gt;Cold Snap and repeat doesn't finish off a fight you can generally Nova and run or Blink away and drop a Frostbolt or two in for good measure. 
---
I don't think Fire is bad for PvP but Blue mage&gt;Red mage. Purple has plenty of potential, though.
---
I’d recommend going full resto. I leveled as full resto without any issues, and I’ve tanked everything outside of MC/Onyxia as full resto. The only class I can’t 1v1 is warlock.
---
Making sure your gear matches your role is more important than spec. Feral tanks can hold aggro better than I can, but our mitigation is basically the same.
---
What makes you want to stay feral/hotw?
---
Was Naxx guy that keep getting brought up like legitimately difficult or is it a running joke? I'm at a point of confusion lol
---
Use the end boss as a guide.  If you are dpsing, you want to be around 4-5 levels lower minimum, if you are doing a full run.  For tanks, you want to be closer to 2-3 levels.
---
"I was the top [class] of my realm for a while."
---
— that friend every one has.
---
I am the rank 12 player who’s playing as an adult not instead of as a child. And it’s fun to see the differences. Definitely not trying to grind that pvp
---
The southpark dude seems to sleep on the couch though.
---
Silver lining.
---
It was more server politics, group management, and time dedication than it was skill. Was still a great time.
---
Probably because this is a tie roll for what is statistically the rarest drop in the game. You are **15 times** more likely to see the Bindings for Thunderfury drop from Baron in MC than this item. And OP lost it on a tie roll. It’s worth posting. 
---
 
---
I believe the drop rate for this was later increased, making it only slightly more likely to drop while still being the rarest item, but I don’t know if that later drop rate increase is in classic.
---
I never raided past MC and only PvPed. Hit Rank 14 on horde Mal'Ganis and Alliance Mannoroth. I definitely remember it correctly because I failed out of college from playing so much and skipping class. People also forget that rank 14 changed every week so there are potentially thousands of people who were Rank 14.
---
2 Words. BANK ALT. Make a level 1 character to park in Org/SW namesd SquillieBank. Mail him all your trade-able stuff. Ores, bars, whatever. Give him 1G to buy a bunch of 8 slot bags. If he fills up, make SquillieBank2 and do the same.
---
A moba style bg where you get stronger for the duration of the battle.
---
Rep grind to change faction
---
I don’t know how to say this... but enchanting your gear pre 60 is pretty dumb (unless you have a main with a lot of money, which you don’t seem to have). It’s honestly just a waste of money, get to 60 with your shit gear and farm then. Can make so much more money
---
Nugrunning is decent for tracking debuffs on multi target or even just non-current targets.
---
CLAP
---
EMERALD
---
CHEEKS
---
Hemo rogues are extremely bad in PvE unfortunately.  There isnt a debuff slot for Hemo in a 40man, so you're basically specced to something that doesnt allow for you to do an optimal dps rotation based on your spec.
---
My guild isnt exactly hardcore but we require our rogues to be combat swords or daggers.  Hemo just doesnt have a place in 40man raiding.
---
There's a ret paladin on my server who took their guild's first BRE. It hurts to look at them.
---
Female Human, Male Dwarf/Gnome
---
Could you point me to the best ones?
---
Getting a mount at 40 is huge.  Not having to worry about gold as you level skills is also a huge speed boost.
---
Took me 222 runs to get it on retail. I feel her pain.
---
The thing is some groups wouldn't care even if you ask them. Most healers just tell me to put a two hander on :D
---
Lol, not saying at all you think druids are bad tanks, you run with one! Yeah we dont have the talent for reduced taunt (so ours is 10s).   
---
I think a lot of the stigma came with druids only have 160% (not 360% bonus armor when MC first came out, and a few other things where they really just werent good tanks. after the buff people never changed their minds.  
---
I played Tera when it came out and it was a stigma that archers were useless, and as it was a game (at the time) with no damage meter people just went with what they'd heard. If you group finder-ed into an endgame group with an archer, 9/10 times the archer was immediately kicked from the group.  
---
The funny part is that archers DPS  WAS terrible in the korean version when it came out, when the US version came out they already had received their buffs and were one of the top single target DPS in the game, on top of a vastly OP button where \~1/2 the time they could slow the boss's attack speed by 50%
---
It's possible to solo the boss and imps as a hunter but you have to clear the 3 trash packs first which would not be worth it time-wise I think(because all trash aggro when the imps spawn). Maybe someone will figure out a way! :D
---
135 guilds CLEARED naxx.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/8t6p7i/the_real_list_of_119_useu_guilds_that_cleared/
---
That's 5400 people. 
---
A lot of people killed atleast the first 3 bosses in naxx (easy). I'd say guesstimate 600 guilds, maybe more.  There was around 20 guilds on mal'ganis alone. That's 24,000 people.  I believe lots of people have done a bit of Naxx.
---
I don't think raiding naxx was as crazy as an achievement as people make it out to be. It's an old game, that was 13 years ago. Lot of people here have very little Vanilla experience due to age. If they were older or spent more time playing the game back then, they might have been a naxx raider too. If you want to know if someone killed bosses in nax, ask their age. If they're younger than 28, probably not.
---
Good advice here
---
Priest whispered me after the roll and said they'd give me the staff if they won the eye, but alas..
---
So we talking like dominos? Papa johns? Pizza hut? Winners choice? Very important question.
---
You... I remember you....
---
Scarlet Chestguard dropped and I rolled as the tank and won it. Big upgrade, but found out a few minutes later its a potential twink item in 30-39 bracket and if I held I could have made 100g probably.
---
Granted. Now there are twice as many rogues, because the obnoxious assholes need a class to play. (Source: was a hunter in vanilla, am a rogue in classic)
---
They attract mega-guilds like Hurricane and The Enclave (on Grobbulus specifically) that are world pvp focused. The kind of people who look to join those guilds tend to be more toxic than your average player. When you get a higher number of people like that congregating together, it just amplifies the toxicity.
---
Grobbulus is fun and this is part of the reason why I chose it. But you have to have the mind-set that this is going to be part of it. I for one like the server-drama, but it isn't for everybody.
---
That thing doesnt even support some of my dungeon gear? So im not sure how i can get stat weight of my current gear. It doesn't even support blacksmithing which 2 of my gear pieces are blacksmithed
---
Yes, at endgame, I don’t think there is a worse dps than Ret. maybe a melee hunter or a balance druid.
---
Cool to see in Vanilla! is the drop rate back down to 1/1000 like it used to be?
---
OK, but you're still talking in passive. Who did he lose to? Did it go to someone's off-spec? Did it go to that new guy who's the GM's little brother?
---
It's something like this (0/18/33):

Frostadamus has a video about ZF farming where he uses a frost/arcane spec &amp; something similar to this one. He calls it 'elemental' due to the points in Master of Elements but I think it's too confusing and prefer to consider it a frostfire build. I'm trying it with the stun chance instead of the fireball cast reduction time, but I think the stun happens enough that unless you're geared enough to obliterate mobs, it's just not worth it.
---
There's room for tweaking too. I went with the shorter frostbolt because it's required in so many dungeons to use it often when fire resist is high, but you could definitely go 2 into Frost Warding instead for the higher armor for aoe farming. You could also take points out of improved blizzard and toss them into something else (like more frost dmg, lower frostbolt cast time, etc). I'm feeling pretty squirrely about it 'cause I don't have the gold to just keep respeccing and trying things out (literally just dinged the other day) but there are a few tweaks to this I'd like to try out. I think he takes the improved blizzard to just be able to still utilize the spell, but 3 points in a slow if you're not using it for farming seems kind of goofy to me.
---
Hope you play with it and come up with a combo you like though!
---
The accomplishments of my guild/raid were killing Onyxia and farming Zul'Gurub. I feel like a total noob nowadays :(.
---
It's pre-raid BiS for you and sounds like a huge upgrade, so I'd definitely go for it.  As you say, the only thing you'll need gold for is raid repairs and consumes.
---
I find math will get easier as you get older.  It will make sense one day.
---
Love it
---
For swords* 
---
+Dmg is better for rogue daggers
---
Good for ambushes.  Hunters use it a bunch.
---
For rogues, not really too useful.
---
This meme does not make any physical sense.
---
Some might called it a strange fruit
---
It probably does another internal roll in the event of a tie, but it really should show the 2nd roll (or 3rd if it ties again lol).
---
the brilliant minds of this subreddit never cease to amaze me.
---
You are right if you can make it to an evade spot any class can do it!
---
im gonna do this tonight then lol

Sulfuras Alliance Represent! Was so much fun last night.

I never thought I’d die this way... but I’d always really hoped.

How to explain the fun of this to non WoW people?  LOVE IT!
---
He was 21 when the game came out. How bad at math are you?
---
Is it controversial to say I've seen nobody saying this/bragging about it?
---
Its less about the healing numbers for me at least, MSBT does it just fine. But after raiding so many expansions with being able to see healing numbers over the raid members character I have gotten very used to it, but didn't really understand how much information that relays to the healer. Its not about healing its more about positioning.  Having that extra piece of information added, provides so much positioning information to the healer, not just my positioning but the positioning of everyone in the raid.  It's not like all the information comes at once but slowly over the course of the fight.  Let's say I heal (Hunter) in retail I will get the information of his position every time I heal him, it's not something I think about as it happens but slowly form a mental map of where each individual in my raid is standing over the course of the fight, even over the course of multiple attempts.
---
?
---
As other have said, 6-7 days if you're speed leveling and following a guide.
---
**If you're worried about taking too long**, then let me give you some advice. (If this doesn't apply to you, then maybe it will help someone else)
---
Don't get yourself too focused on hitting 60. I have seen many people back in 2005-2008 that focused entirely on getting to top level and then were extremely disappointed when they finally made it. You don't magically get twice as strong when you ding 60 and the game doesn't change that much. You will still be doing dungeons and quests for gear.
---
Try to spend more time making friends, helping other people, reading quests, investing in the AH/Professions, etc.
---
It's a trap that people fall into when they start saying, "Oh man, I can't wait till I hit 60" and somehow convince themselves that everything is going to be so much better.
---
The rule of thumb is always, and if you have to leave SF to heal it's likely you have lost the fight anyway.
---
Late game ret dps is terrible
---
Had a rogue ragequit our LC guild because he didn't get t2 helm despite having Aged Core leather gloves, perdition blade, core hound tooth and ony head. 
---
Somehow being the most geared player in the guild wasn't enough for this guy. Oh well, at least the cancer didn't grow.
---
Oh by the way.. he got all those in one night. And we run 3 split onyxia groups twice a week.
---
I hit 60 in 8d 20hours in one sitting. Can’t recommend it lol
---
the big cats that night elves ride. are they called saber or sabre? im not sure, english is not my first language...
---
Ahh, wafflepwn. Whole series of fake freak outs, and they're all great.
---
I also mentioned that my r4 number were the average yet my lowest number was higher than the supposed average :p  
---
But thanks, that other spreadsheet is way better, math seems to be pretty spot on :)
---
Ever heard of raiding? lol at you saying gold loses value after epic mount
---
haha can't argue that logic
---
That's almost always the case, unless you're making an alt to play with friends or you're on a pve server where you can choose the other faction. 
---
With an alt on the same server/faction you can give it gold to start out, significantly increasing the leveling speed. You can also have it be another income when it gets to the appropriate level. You can have him be an herb/alch for your main for example
---
That's how I feel about undead being a part of Horde.
---
Those dang Tauren always rascalin’ around with their big milky tits floppin all over the place

I see a guildie of mine!!!

Depends if you can get more value from something else.  If you swap to herbing for example, can you farm up enough to offset the cost of lvling tailoring again?
---
It's a Friday afternoon at the office! :)
---
This is only reserved for the BRD group that is taking hours because the tank only uses thunderclap.
---
Agree... unless you're a completionist, Uldaman just isn't worth the hassle.
---
Do you know how to disable the sounds, or at least change their volume?
---
Shadow priests do fine right now. They suck later when their lack of scaling and mana issues start to reveal themselves.
---
How competitive is your guild? If you are in a tryhard guild archmage is essentially required since its bis until phase 4 which is a year away. Frost lich is decent but archmage is a straight up upgrade from that. T1 gets blown out by both, only volatile power comes close.
---
I love my guild, I joined it in a pug when they had like 20 60 guildies. At the start they announced that they knew most people had never done the content including most of their guild. Only that raid leader had done it recently on private servers so we were going to go slow. We did 8/10 in about 2.5 hours with no wipes and almost everyone there joined the guild. Now we can full clear mc and ony in about 3 hours including killing rag pre submerge. The only boss we have ever wiped on is ony, which we wiped on the first try the first 2 times we did it.
---
I wish we could have lithe male models for the rogues/casters. That'd be so awesome.

Rank 14 required being in the top .01% for a month straight or something. Rank 10-13 were achievable by running premades for 3-4 hrs a night. It was quite the difference.
---
&gt;just knowing that the shadow priest does absolutely nothing in raids
---
Lol what? Our spriest pulls 400-600 dps on most fights and he didnt get anathema until yesterday.
---
If your raid has MC on farm, your dps should be getting it before your healers. Healing most fights is a complete joke. Your guild did the right thing.
---
&gt; Frost nova, Arcane Explosion, downranked frostbolts, Blinking LoS: there isn't really a lot of down time with Frost PvP. 
---
Literally none of that is exclusive to frost. And AE? Really? Are you PvPing with 10k mana? 
---
&gt;CoC&gt;Nova&gt;Fireblast&gt;AE&gt;Cold Snap and repeat doesn't finish off a fight you can generally Nova and run or Blink away and drop a Frostbolt or two in for good measure.

On what planet do you only fight once every 10 minutes?

It actually gets worse for your argument when you move away from 99th percentile.

It sucks that there's no reward for doing this. If you get honor from killing leaders or defending too...

It's off by default, but you can enable it to show HOT overheals too.

This.

I am also one of the unfortunate ones to have ruined my youth by raiding 6-7 nights a week for what felt like several years, all while losing most of my rl friends and family connections..
---
Today, I play classic and I love it, though I never really tell people that I cleared naxx and shit. To be honest Im actually a little ashamed of that.. 
---
I dont remember most of the mechanics really. I remember the social aspects, the nerd screams and the grind. 
---
Pvt server people outclass me any day of the week.
---
9 to 10 atm. If you flask it's around 12.
---
Good job... one thing you want to mention is you said disc priest and later said your brother died to not having a healer.
---
 * Orc: Axe Specialization ergo higher Weapon Skill
---
 * Tauren: 5% increases HP. Males have +1 reach because of character model. 
---
 * Trolls: Berserk and Regen allow for highest Threat per second. 
---
 * Undead: a fear breaker
---
There's a buttload of posts and theorycrafting surrounding the benefits of the racials for the tanks. But the benefits UD and Tauren fall off faster than Orc and Troll.
---
Lol this comment is quite funny.
---
Back in the day it was Tauren for the extra health and their awesome appearance in warrior gear. It's probably orc or troll now with the all the min maxing going around.
---
Just being silly. ;)
---
Damn, so they fix it even in classic sadly.  
---
Thx !
---
&gt; I think it's just like buffs, If previous cast was higher rank, or same rank with talent point improvements, you can't overwrite theirs. I don't believe + healing is considered at all, only spell rank and talents.
---
Pretty sure it's just raw tick value (then longer duration if it's the same). Rank and talents don't matter directly, though it takes a lot of +heal to make up the difference.
---
Orc/Troll warrior for Single target tanking and Blood Elf Paladin for AoE tanking

I leave my name on as an old habit from retail where it was to feed my ego with cool titles I had to flex with, but now its just there because it looks weird without my name there
---
This is why I've never ran with special characters in any names! Far too much trouble for what you get out of it. Better off grabbing a different name instead...
---
I play a feral tank druid and have a permanent raid spot with my guild.  They definitely see the value I bring other than that sweet 15 - 20th position on the DPS meters.
---
1)  All the melees in my party get 3% crit which increases raid dps
---
2) Battle rez / innervate
---
3) On the decurse heavy fights I am usually the top decurser, allowing mages to do more damage
---
4) On fights where OTs are needed I am a great option, and can also hop into bear and try to MT if tanks are dead
---
5) If things really go down the tube, I have maybe 10 semi powerful heals I can throw out before OOMing
---
Anyone who takes in a hybrid and only looks at DPS meters is an idiot.  It's like saying most people on a winning soccer team suck because only 2 guys got a goal.
---
You guys like to sit at Thorium Point like you did a few nights ago. The saltiness from a long flight get to you guys?

Regular RP servers have their issues, too. The crazies are actual RPers though and you'll be eyeballs deep into the RP scene with them before they reveal how insane they actually are, and then it's a big deal. At least with Grobbulus the crazy is limited to people who seem overtly like the kind of folk I'd like to avoid.

But we need to give the hunter curse of recklessness. So he doesnt get feared by the demon in silithus.

Thanks for the detailed response! This sounds great

Ya, you’re correct - the point was to make this the guildie on the other side of the gate. The goal was to get both posts to be front page to create context - and they were, but suddenly the other disappeared.

---
&gt;Everything goes smoother, easier, and MUCH faster using optimal tanks, dps, and healers.
---
Are you aware that the "perfect" raid group in classic has a lot of hybrids in it? For example speccing all shamans in your raid pure restro instead of a hybrid spec makes your raid less effective.
---
Its 2 hours for priest quest.

Oh absolutely, but the post does state "this subreddit"

Bad at maths or dyslexic

I love Ret paladins so much. It's so so so much better than having just another random DPS. They're swiss army knives.
---
I have the same issue, it typically happens when I drink to restore mana. Even if he is very far away he will re aggro to me and I need to kite him for awhile. Not sure why it’s happening but you’re not alone!
---
Yeah I hit 60 but I’m rerolling now lol.

379 upvotes of a screenshot of the number 69 twice. Actual useful or interesting classic wow discussion: not seen for days.

Spell power works on a coefficient system.  Hardcasts or instants are based on cast time base of 3.5, **before talents**.
---
So a 3 sec cast is 3/3.5 = 85% of spell power applied to the spell.  So, 100 SP would give 85 damage to a shadowbolt.
---
Instants count as 1.5sec (gcd).
---
Dots are based on duration of 15s.   So 15/15 = 100%
---
You can't exceed 100 on dots or casts, so 18/15 = 100% , not 120%.
---
Any skill that damages *and* heals gets a 50% modifier on the above calculation.  So siphon life is 50% as it's a 30 second dot (100%) that heals (divide 100 in two).
---
AOE spells get 33% of the above modifier (divide by 3), so arcane explosion is 1.5/3.5/3 = 14%
---
Anything channeled gets the above calculation split across all of the ticks.  Same for AOE channeled.  Channeled counts as a hard cast calculation not a dot, so rain of fire is 3.5/3.5/3.  Drain life is 3.5/3.5/2 (because it heals).
---
The only thing I forget is how hybrid skills work, like immolate.  From memory, they scale terribly, but I forget how the calculation goes.
---
All this means that certain talents become very valuable.  The 0.5 sec cast reduction on frostbolt and shadowbolt particularly, because you don't lose spell power.  Or imp SWP for priests, because it adds two ticks at the same damage (essentially making the spell a 120% spellpower ability, if I remember).
---
Heartseeker Alliance mage here.  If you don't attack me I'll generally leave you alone.
---
This goes out the window if you start on the same unique quest mob I'm on, though.
---
The rank 14 grind is stupid insane. I think it's only going to be worse with many more players per server.
---
That’s whacky cuz if I join a group with 2 mages or any mage on my “Magelet List” I leave immediately.

---
The 1.12 patch is my biggest let down. It really did make it too easy.
---
Like buffs, DoTs, and slows, HoTs can't overwrite something more powerful (or with a duration shorter than what's left on the active one, if they're the same tick/slow%/stat bonus). For renews that means if the other priest's renew ticks for more than yours, you'll never overwrite it.

When you get an item you have +1 which means anyone who needs the same item as you but doesn't have +1 has prio over you, since he hasn't gotten an item yet.

I raided Naxx! but we didn't do all that well and then TBC came out so fuck it lol  I think we killed 2 or 3 bosses maybe..... That shit was hard AF
---
there are several roles for officers. an officer need not be a class leader. they could be an event organizer for RP for example, and or recruitment, or any other conceivable nonconventional role that may exist in the many different styles of guilds there are.
---
there are several ways to play this game that dont require all officers of a guild to be good players.
---
Oh fuck yes...
---
There used to be, not sure if it exists anymore.  Druidbar I think it was called.

TLDR: OP stop being happy
---
And now it doesn't make any sense, considering that he's inside stratholme on main entrance
---
I made LC rank and decided that even during the summer of middle school that the grind to GM wasn't worth it.
---
Well I would say that someone can still spec Heart/NS and take Improved Mark. Heart is one of the viable builds for healing . I personally like moonglow. Deep resto builds are not necessary and get better when you have a bigger mana pool .
---
Just curious what you prefer since OP’s doesn’t seem to tickle your fancy. I’m always looking for new UI ideas
---
I’ll try man I still need dead ring from Mara
---
Same here. I think I was rank 10-12 in pvp, raided naxx. Stopped playing after Vanilla. It doesn't make me good now, it's great nostalgia but it's been 13 years (naxx was 2006) and I don't remember JACK shit about 80% of the game. I quit WOW after mid tbc. We're talking about 15 yo vs 28 yo.  I always feel awkward af when I say what I did in vanilla. Might just stop all together, too many people think its a brag/lie. 
---
I also think people underestimate how many people full cleared naxx and how many people likely killed at least the first 3 bosses.
---
I'm not even going to bother. I'm going for Rank 10. I'm an old man now with a big kid job. I salute anyone who tries, but damn.
---
Price is still sort of high on my server. You can try resetting the market for 1g25 or something like that, or pretty stacking to sell. People love just buying the exact right amount of things they need and sometimes will pay a little bit more for the convenience.
---
Idk I'm level 59 and have not seen a single purple drop yet....boe or bop... F
---
Its extremely frustrating.  At least a dps can go farm things easily...im one of the main healers for raid, so i prefer to stay holy so i can do everything i can there.  I really would rather not respec every week, and farming things is super frustrating as holy.
---
At least my druid is finally getting closer (47 now).  If someone doesnt have the time/desire to level an alt and wants to main healer theyre going to get pretty frustrated.
---
Being a healer without being able to get dungeon groups just makes you kind of useless.
---
No, you're just wrong.
---
Fair warning, saying this gets you corpse camped
---
Yes there is.  While the animation plays you can't block.  This problem came about because of judgement.
---
you can insert custom fonts in msbt
---
there is a folder in the addonpack. just put the font file in there.
---
i have supermario letters and pacman crits haha
---
Nothing you really can do as a tank other than let the priest/paladin know to dispell asap or have whoever is being targeted to pop a CD.
---
I was a huge proponent of the older nagas, I had the original and the v2 until the mousewheel started double ticking sometimes. That mouse lasted me until the Corsair Scimitar released and I switched to that, happy and content, but by this point I wasn't playing MMO's anymore, so while I had the thumbgrid and used it for utility like in fps's I didn't use it nearly as often as I did when playing WoW. 
---
Once Classic released I started having thumb problems. Because my default thumb position is resting on the 1 key, I found myself having to press my thumb down into the mouse mat to be comfortable and that put a lot of stress on my thumb. 
---
So I went and bought a Naga Trinity which has the 1 key much higher off the mat than the Scimitar while keeping the grid in the right position for the length of my thumb (the Scimitar could adjust up and back but this made my thumb uncomfortable in a different way)
---
So far so great, no complaints on build quality immediately. But we'll see if it lasts me the 4-5 years the other ones did before that.

Yeah man it's nice. I'm a holy paladin but use flurry axe for my solo set. With seal of righteousness, it procs even more often. So happy I bought one to use.
---
&gt; the weightings you’re looking at have Int as 1 point too which seems too high.
---
I'm a mage, but 1 int = 1 sp is laughable, and crit &gt; hit is just downright wrong.
---
thanks for the input.  I had read a similar account on the official forum.   I'm very close to pulling the trigger on the transfer now.
---
Mind linking your prebis list? I’ve seen some conflicting stuff floating around and I’m trying to get geared up as spriest
---
There was definitely an attitude in vanilla that because raid mechanics were set and PvP was "different" every time that pvp was vastly more difficult. I can remember thinking that myself. Looking back it's a bunch of people trying to compensate for the comparatively low skill set required for MMOs in general.
---
I mean I totally get that, as a healer I don’t care for meters. More “is the boss dead, good, if not bad”. Just wanted to point out that Druid healers arent this useless class and can put up big numbers if given the chance
---
You go back to retail

I settled on a mage with tailoring and enchanting well before Classic released. I was excited about my choice because I LOVE both professions, and I wanted to get all the enchants and all that. I also wanted to be a guild enchanter and be useful. After level 40 my leveling partner got bored so we just hit 60 a few days ago. I couldn't keep up with enchanting while we were leveling and now I'm wondering if it's worth leveling it when so many other people have all the good recipes already. 
---
Would there be any real benefit to hanging on to enchanting/leveling it to max and getting all the recipes? Or does that just seem silly? I can't decide. :/
---
My other option is herbalism.
---
Lmao I play horde

---
My poor wife lost the roll to this in a guild run where she only had to roll against the other warrior in the group :(

I thought so too, an animation playing on the client shouldn't have any effect on something happening server side. Not sure what cabbage is on about.
---
I'm sorry for your loss :(
---
40 man pally raid inc
---
Yeah, pretty much 6/8 valor. Gotta stay classy in *Classic*.
---
Hey man, do me a favor and /w whoizthisguy and ask him how it feels to die to a 53 mage in Un'goro at level 60.
---
No u
---
He's not wrong, scatter shot helps on 2 of them but you only need it if you slip up. And you should have scatter anyway, it part of any standard raid spec
---
Also, only silithus has any kind of damage check, and there are strats that can avoid even that so any spec is doable. The other 3 most of your damage isn't even coming from anything your spec would have an impact on, mostly melee auto attacks and/or serpent sting
---
Again, play whatever makes you happy, but this group is far from optimal. I'm sure it works great. You can make just about anything work great in 5 mans.
---
Pally buffs are nice, but no paladin tank is going to be judging wisdom in 5 mans when you have a warlock and a shadowpriest nuking things in your group especially when you have no taunt. You are judging for damage every single judgment. Blessing of wisdom is great, but it isn't going to negate shadow priests mana issues. Lack of a taunt is really shitty.
---
Generally if you are talking specifically for grinding 5 mans at 60 defiance arms warrior is probably the king of tanks there.
---
Warlocks are just crappier versions of mages in 5 mans. Truth is painful but not wrong. There might be a niche situation here or there where banish is a thing, but in almost every single situation you'd just rather have a mage. 
---
Spriest damage is sub par. VE is pretty irrelevant in 5 mans. Shadow weaving never has time to stack fully and ideally you have a mage instead of a warlock anyway. The only thing they are really bringing to the table is shackle which is nice in certain situations and you can get that from a holy priest which is gona just be way better than the druid you are bringing. Might as well drop the druid and bring a healing priest.
---
Priests are superior healers to druids in terms of throughput and sustain. You have to sacrifice battle res but your overall sustain and healing throughput is certainly worse that minor loss. The dungeons aren't that hard and nobody is really dieing anyway in a group that is at all organized. 
---
Like I said before. Can you make that group work? Hell yea. Is it going to be fast and efficient if the players are organized and working together? You bet your ass. **Is it optimal?** Far from it.
---
The entire point is that a 90th percentile ret paladin is equivalent to a 65-70th percentile of any other actual dps class and to get those 90th parses they require a lot more hand-holding than any real dps class.
---
Get over it, ret paladin sucks, ele shaman sucks, moonkin sucks, feral sucks, hybrids suck in Classic, if people want to play them be my guest, this content is a fucking joke and can be cleared by anything, but don't try and defend that other fucking moron that says all 3 of his guilds ret paladins are pulling a constant 400dps because they clearly aren't.
---
Be aware, while it "looks" like a tie it probably wasn't. "Rolls" have hidden digits that make a true tie almost impossible.
---
Whale Biologist!

ahh yes, and I remember one of the bosses had a bunch of ads and would make our off tank's computer freeze. IIRC he would have to look at the floor to tank without crashing.
---
naxx really put the test on our shitty computers back in the day lol
---
The mechanic existed before BC
---
He's taking about a TBC bug. It's not applicable here.
---
Flurry axe procs at a rate of about 2 procs per minute. Most procs are closer to one per minute.

With windfury, flurry axe procs quite often.
---
shame, i love ganking lefties :(
---
For me its just right - ive not seen zero bellends but so few that they are not relevant to my enjoyment and purely farcical incidents where i replace them with a good player
---
Honestly, I may never raid. I never even got to level 50 when I used to play (like I said, had no idea what I was doing), and right now my friends and I are in our own guild with a few other members. I at least know how to play properly now, but I still don't really know what raiding even consists of haha!
---
Honestly it will never cease to amaze me how many wow players derive enjoyment from pressing some arbitrary sequence of buttons to deal damage. That's fine if it's your thing, but it's really pointless, and adds nothing to the gameplay, to the type of player who loves classic. 
---
Classic combat is about the tactics: primarily positioning, timing, and character setup. These are the gameplay factors that I enjoy, and ultimately these are the factors that actually require thought and reaction. It's not difficupt or interesting to follow some simple flow-chart of abilities, it is much more complicated to decide where you can pull mobs safely, when to run away, when to use consumables, etc.
---
I could not care less if my raid dps consists of 1 ability, because playing action-bar whack-a-mole with 10 different abilities does absolutely nothing for me. It's not even difficult, it's just pointless. If I could set my Frost mage to literally auto-cast bolts in raids, I would.
---
And that's not even considering pvp which has complexities for every class.
---
Best way? Same server, same faction. For the reasons listed by others.
---
I usually have an alt on another server though, especially in Classic when there are vast differences between realms. For instance, I have an alt on a lower populated PvE server to play on randomly when my main (Full pop PvP) is bogged down from login queues, or if I am logging during "prime time" and don't feel like dealing with the crowd.
---
This one wins.
---
Default frames can give you more information! Under the options select 'show class color' and that helps (so paladins will be pink, druids orange, warlocks purple, etc). You can also have them 'show resource' to see mana bars of other people. 
---
VuhDo shows roles and allows for click-to-heal which is nice, but some people prefer mouseover macros and the default frames! If you want a little vuhdo tutorial, let me know and I'll message it to you.
---
1. HotW spec is not better than full resto or moonglow for raid healing, but it's serviceable.
---
2. Furor is pretty mandatory for outside-of-raid activities using HotW spec because you're most likely in tank or feral gear when dungeon or soloing.
---
Slowest raid ever.... But everybody lives!
---
We do at least double the damage we used to do. There was no damage gear in the day except for greens "of frozen wrath." Its not just game knowledge and gamers being very used to this type of content.
---
Bearly missed it.
---
Multiboxing doesn't really break the game though does it?  Unless we're talking about pvp, but then multiboxing has it's own challenges even in that scenario.   There isn't really one single area alone where multiboxing "breaks the game", which ultimately is why it's been allowed for so long - not only in WoW but so many other games too.
---
* Multiboxing supposedly ruins the economy.   Not really.  With group looting in place, multiboxers have to kill multiples of their party size compared to solo players to get the drops they need, including quest items.
---
* Multiboxing makes it hard for others to get their quest mobs.   The exact same as trying to complete a quest in an area where there is a party full of 5 different players.
---
* Multiboxing kills the community.  Again, not really.  This is one guy who prefers to solo.  He'd never have grouped with you anyway
---
* Multiboxing ruins PVP.   Nope.  Figure out which is the lead character and kill that. Then the others are virtually helpless.  We have the solution already.
---
I don't multibox personally, but I understand it and I'm taking a pragmatic approach here.
---
Target was impressively negligent on this one, they were routinely showing in stock months after everywhere was sold out. I wonder if a single order after day one was honored.
---
Makes sense lol
---
Isn't this MMOs in a nutshell though? The only difference at end game, is we're stacking the chances to be more likely to find good things for us.
---
BUR!
---
No chance I'm taking wing clip and counterattack over intimidation. If you are spamming wing clip on a rogue or warrior hoping for a proc, you already lost the fight. Sure-footed isn't important either because hit is trivial to get from gear (I have Bizznicks anyway.) Entrapment for frost traps in AB and WSG choke points (tunnel, bridges) is one of the most useful pieces of kit hunters have in premades. It's a main reason they're brought besides being viper sting bots. 
---
You're right about humanoid slaying &gt; ranged weapon spec.
---
Any warriors/rogue going dagger spec? That can help move some weapons around
---
Is anyone else hoping Matt and trey make another WoW episode in honor or classic?!
---
That's the one.
---
It's fine for my taste... looks cool, hits well enough, does the job.  But then I ain't a min/max kind of dude.  It's fun to have a purple item equipped.
---
You are an appropriate level to run ZF. I would wait until 48 to tank a full run of mara. And 52 for Sunken Temple. Honestly, your best bet is to run to The Hinterlands to do the ZF prereq quests (get the mallet), then head to Tanaris and do those quests in between ZF runs.
---
aye, now we are the raiders B)
---
This has been posted 4 times
---
Yes it's similar to how a warrior spamming Battle shout in a raid will generate more threat than spamming demoralizing shout.
---
Its all a game. You only have to be better at analysis, or be a better bullshitter, than the decision maker above you. To justify your decisions or to provide them recommenations. People suck at analyzing things and often youre the only one with enough time invested to be capable of calling bullshit. I assume my experience only fits with large organizations.
---
There are those in the Alliance on Rattlegore that may have an interest in seeing the Frostmane returned to their homeland and former glory. Perhaps some Dwarf priest ambassadors could MC and keep their Frostmane allies healed up in their fight to retake their Frosty Hole.
---
Don't think there is a website,  only way I think you can figure it out is have someone you know make an Alli toon on that server,  meet up and talk.
---
You have to run into the corner and spam it for about a minute because he patrols. Look it up on youtube for the spot to stand. Very easy
---
How do you open a vial with paws?
---
&gt; I left a guild full of people that "had KT on farm"
---
That's maybe what, 300-400 people worldwide?  Wasn't it something like 120 guilds total that managed even a single KT kill?
---
Haha the technique! Might be gluth, the zombie dog with all the adds that had to be kitted by mages and hunts
---
Using translators to communicate with the other faction is bannable
---
worst case scenario, 40 bubble hearths and fly back!
---
Its hard to decide on THE favorite zone to be honest, so many good ones.  
---
I think I choose Elwynn Forest just because it was the first zone I've ever seen in this game. So many memories to this place... 15 years later its still one of my favorite zones!
---
We're already disenchanting druid gear, it hurts
---
Lol. People are in here claiming that they do less dps than tanks and that you can't possibly clear content in this extremely easy game because of mathematical inferiority and that's straight up garbage. If you're not playing at 90 percentile or higher you should be worried about your own dps. Dps in classic raids is literally 1-2 buttons and yet within pure dps classes there's 200-300% variance. Unless you're playing perfectly it literally does not matter; I'd rather have a good boomkin and kill it in 1 minute 8 seconds than a shitty mage and kill it in 1 minute and 6 seconds... every single time.
---
Btw post your logs. Id love to see how bad you are.
---
Why should it not be allowed? There is a person paying for those accounts?
---
Heart NS is just fine for the current content.

Saying that it outperforms Moonglow or Swiftmend is a straight lie though. Or maybe he's just *that* stupid.

A proper downtime stroke is imperative to a positive classic experience.

Yes. The enemies you are going to kill on your way to 60 will drop Rune Cloth which you can hand in at major cities. It’s like getting started to farm the rep :)
---
I'm not wrong, the guy is talking out of his ass about something he doesn't know.  During the animation the paladin doesn't count as having a shield.  It was always a problem bu no one did anything about it until paladins were tanking.
---
Go find something which attacks fast.  Use holy shield and judge.  There will be a brief window you never block.  It was an issue in vanilla and it carried into BC.
---
Ending layering should mean banning multiboxing as well.

In the logs it shows your gear as feral though.
---
amazed you all greeded and someone actually passed
---
Your going to find a bunch of  HotW/NS  druids because it's the "bastard child" spec of doing a bit of everything.
---
PvP, Solo as Feral, Tank for 5 mans, and still have enough heals to get into dungeons and raids as a healer.
---
It is not the most optimal healing output or mana efficiency and usually requires another druid in the raid to agree to do all the buffing.
---
Take a peek at the other common druid restro builds on wow head  [https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/druid-healing-talents-builds-classic-wow](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/druid-healing-talents-builds-classic-wow) for more insights.
---
Because even if you are lucky enough to win a roll on one binding, you’re almost certainly not going to see the next one drop in a pug AND win the roll on it. 
---
And then, even with the small chance of the above happening. You’ll have to come up with roughly 10k gold worth of mats to make it (and be in a guild/pug that can get far enough in BWL to let you smelt the ore)
---
PUGS shouldn’t be able to free roll on them if the run is more than half guild imo. Basically a waste of a binding
---
My fav part was when you blinded the mage that the warrior was already fighting.
---
\^\^\^
---
I meant the fights in MC will get shorter and shorter. By the end of private servers, many fights in Naxx were also getting blown through and you would see numbers skewed by fight length even there. It will only be more extreme w classic being so easy.
---
Ret pallies are just pure garbage not much more to say
---
for totem twisting, prepare to go broke paying for drinks for the grps where there is no mages. I tried to do it, but I had no mana left to heal with
---
Granted! now your overpower never procs (and therefore, cannot miss)
---
Reddit mobile app fucking up. Posted it once and it posted it 4 times. Why would people even be allowed to post 4-5 times in a 30 second period
---
Attack the hunter, save the demon
---
Overall idea is that you need to kill a double pack(dwarves) , then the triple pack (2 dwarves, 2 fire ele) on top of the stairs at Angerforge. Then  double jump (jump to invisible ledge left side of stairs, then jump onto ledge) and ranged pull Angerforge via adds. Kill add adds via ranged by hopping off and on ledge when they get near melee range. Then slowly beat down Angerforge and bandaging during ledge hops. Then at ~41% you burst him down to zero before adds can reach you and vanish.
---
Mine was day one, and was not honored.
---
It's good for leveling and grinding but not much else imo. That's why you see more tauren/orc warriors.
---
I forgot I had just swaped melee weapons and only had like 100 weapon skill the first time I pulled him lol
---
*Everyone disliked that*
---
At least you're stuck on a playable realm.
---
I forgot that getting world buffs and pressing starfire (occasionally moonfire) is something people are incapable of doing. 
---
I have yet to see you provide any data, meanwhile I've shown you data on the dps ceiling of boomkin, which is not as low as you'd make it out to be. 
---
I also played Boomkin in TBC, but unfortunately that really doesn't matter when discussing Boomkin in vanilla, which is quite literally just a starfire machine.
---
Damn. Just passed halfway...
---
how does he die
---
I volunteer as tribute. Blizzard, I will gladly do thy bidding in game in exchange for a free monthly.
---
You can't cannibalize friendly players. Which is odd since the name is cannibalize.
---
I'm pretty much the same. Did everything upto 4H.
---
There have been surprises both ways. Forgetting how seemingly simple stuff works, and remembering things that others forgot.
---
Especially since I never played on pservers and most of my guild did, so there are some quirks they were used to that are just different in vanilla/classic.
---
How should I value items with increased shadow damage as a warlock? Is it more important than intel? Also, does it increase my wand damage if my wand deals shadow damage?
---
Exactly. You're eating an invasive species. It's better for the native fauna.
---
Tbh they should make exceptions for this kind of stuff.  If your whole guild xfers and you miss a window it's kinda fucked.
---
It's fun to run dungeons when they are new and you've not done the quests there. However there are quite a few dungeons that are more hassle than they are worth, and a decent chunk that probably drop nothing or next to nothing for your current class at any reasonable rate.
---
Burning steppes spawn point is just west of the big ramp up to BRM. Helped a hunter today with buffs and all before he started

HS is 157 damage (non-crit, before armor) for 15 rage, and removes any rage gain you would receive from you MH auto-attack landing. This makes its actual cost closer to 25-30+ rage.
---
Bloodthirst is ~450 damage in close to pre-raid bis (non-crit, before armor, assuming ~1k AP) for 30 rage, and most importantly does not delay your auto attack. The damage per rage is much higher for BT than HS, *even if HS did not replace your auto-attack*.
---
Even WW, which is just flat MH weapon damage, is more damage per rage than HS.
---
BT and WW also have the added bonus of proc'ing on-hit effects like Hand of Justice or Flurry. HS just replaces an auto attack
---
Nothing wrong with multi boxing.
---
Can you post your talent build? Or is 30/21/0 a standard build? (I'm currently leveling a paladin cause I love to tank and heal and this is intriguing).
---
Lulz i was 13 or over i cant remember
---
That guild's leaders are fucking dogshit.  Run.
---
Not according to the last tank I ran with. Every wipe was because we "aren't a good comp". It *couldn't* have been because he ran in without checking for pats, or face pulling while the healer is at 20% Mana...
---
Meats back on the menu boys!
---
Related question, why are you farming the zombies? gold or random drops?
---
For some things if you can time a taunt just before you get disabled, the mob will finish casting and then hit you, breaking it.  Not really reliable, but it can work.
---
Except a lot of time we are working for the bad guys.
---
It happened to me, trying to help a hunter, didn't know was the rokh'delar quest
---
Have you *seen* D&amp;D wizards from like 3.5 and PF? Because that explains mages
---
1) Are hunters farming tribute the highest GPH atm? If so, what kind of gear is required? I know speccing surv is probably best due to FD resist.
---
2) What dungeons should a new tank start with?
---
That’s fine for you’re main. If we’re taking strictly about leveling an alt to do nothing but grid gold, the entire point is to max and do that. You would speed level that. Sure 10 days for a casual play style and a first character who doesn’t care is fine.
---
44 as far as pure xp required.  In my personal case though I usually hit halfway in terms of /played time around 48 because i can speed through the first 40ish levels, but the 50s suck and I hate them.
---
If I were you I'd keep opening tickets and calmly explaining why it's fucked and ask for it to be escalated.   Someone's gonna give in eventually
---
Yah it did. Made 100g in a couple hours last night.  So done with playing the AH and losing money
---
You act as a druid wearing t1 is gonna make it hard to heal MC. Classic WoW is extremely easy.
---
How can I say “Takes one to know one” in the nicest way possible?
---
Back in vanilla, only one druid in the raid was having a HOT spec, the others were downranking and healing with Healing touch. The Druid in question was maxing his healing power and it was useful for maexxna too, when the whole raid was cocooned
---
less work but you will lose speed doing it in the long run, you really need pathfinding to make that work
---
Not to mention that a single major mana pot refills 2/3 of my mana and allows me to keep using abilities. What good is spirit to a class that is ideally never outside the 5sr? Just because a class has a blue bar doesn't mean they need to stack int or spirit. Also, hit% is useless? Bwahaha! Sounds like a rogue that's just salty he lost a HoJ roll, lol.
---
If it's not a twink item or BiS then it's probably worth it to use.  The economy (on my server) is junk and BOEs sell so cheap.
---
And quillboars skin orcs, I believe
---
Omg, I could have been wearing Dempsters of Shadow Wrath?
---
I will have you know that I did ALL of that while NOT having an account during Vanilla. That's how hardcore of a player I was. I didn't even have to play to earn all of that shit, it was too easy man. I mean sure, I was only like 15-16 years old during all this stuff but I was a PRO player! Just like everyone who said they raided through Naxx and AQ40 like it was absolutely nothing back then even though they either weren't born yet or were still in diapers at the time - we're all Pro's.
---
Liteninghoof lives in BRD. When did he have a chance to kill someone? Did they not honor Ironfoe being reserved?
---
"Not sure how familiar you are with the mage class I've played for 15 years ... but cold snap is a 10 minute cooldown"
---
How much are you charging for autographs lol? Yeah, like I said, Snap is great and lets you double up but it's not necessary so=good to have when it's available, not going to hurt you too much when it's on cooldown. Pretending an ability is useless because it has a long cooldown is silly. 
---
"You're absolutely delusional if you think that's a viable PvP strategy. 100% out of your fucking mind."
---
Have you ever tried PvP with a mainly Frost build? CoC and Fireblast have short cooldowns even without Snap up. Nova isn't terribly long either. Mix in Blinks, r1 Frost Bolt and Block if you get in trouble and it's absurdly easy to kite until your instants are back up. Frost is pretty much Kiting 101. 
---
For someone who's played mage 15 years it sounds like you found one style you liked and decided that was the superior method despite being in the minority. 
---
Unless you're talking about a mixed Fire/Frost elementalist mage like Vurtne made popular. That's totally viable but you can't really call it a "fire" mage when the talents are almost evenly split.
---
If you spec fire and grab iceblock, you aren't a fire mage, you're an elemental mage.
---
I was disappointed you couldn't skin centaurs... in theory you should be able to.
---
Dude you just tossed Thrall’s salad... you legend!
---
You might wanna look for a new guild
---
Yeah man FAP completely shuts down frost mage. The only counterplay is to burst you down 100 to 0 with instant casts (which doesn't work really) or Ice Block &gt; Cold Snap &gt; Ice Block to wait it out. At that point if you cant beat a mage with no CDs idk what to tell ya haha
---
20-30 pieces where 0-10 of them are offsets (in a pretty big loot table with lots of junk epics); and as for the tier pieces there's 2 slots, with 8 class in each slot.
---
Even if you get lucky as fuck on a boss (1,5625%) to have 2x tier pieces of your class from a boss, you will STILL have to compete with 5-8 (depending on your class).
---
When you just look at 20-30 items, it sounds like alot, but the probability to get something from a run 
---
(that is actually useful and wanted) is actually pretty low.
---
I really wish blizzard would do some soft balancing so this kind of thing would stop happening, classic being the warriors game just because warriors happened to be the flavor of the month doing the 1.12 patch really sucks.
---
Just a shot in the dark but I'm guessing that RP Servers tend to be a high value target for PVP guilds because it's more opportunity to mess with other people
---
I remember reading about an RP guild that did an in-game funeral for a guildie that actually passed and the other faction found out and ganked it heavily (Not in Classic mind you)
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_2.1.0_(undocumented_changes)
---
Patch 2.1 first undocumented change is when it was fixed.
---
It was an animation because casting would usually put the shield on the back for some reason and there was a window where the character was flagged as not having a shield.  It happened during instants like consecrate/judgement and it would happen during blessing as well.
---
Healer or anyone with dispell should always be keeping an eye out for LOS locations to avoid getting polyed, silenced, etc., then pop out with the dispells. For Vosh they can hangout in the hallway and once the tank/melee get hexxed pop in, dispell, and you're set. And in general heals should try to stay as far away from pulls as possible to avoid potential silences/interupts
---
12-15 is exactly right if you're actually playing the game and not just focused on leveling.
---
The real reason to be heart of the wild is that you can swap between healing and tank without respeccing, sometimes within the same fight.  If you are not doing this there is not much of a point in being hotw build.
---
You will never be as good as a full resto druid, a priest, holy pally or a prot warrior as hotw. However, going all the way down feral for leader of the pack has no impact on your tanking ability, which is why it's an interesting build if you want to tank.
---
If there's absolutely no one providing lotp you could argue that losing 2% mana from tranquil spirit for 3% raidwide crit from lotp is a better build though.
---
Here's a video showing how hotw is used in aq40  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG5P71m6D4g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG5P71m6D4g)
---
Ice trolls and Darkspear trolls are not the same faction, so it makes sense for the Ice trolls to be enemies of the horde.

Thanks homie will do.

And yet she murdered surviving humans of Lordaeron in WC3. She was always evil, ever since being undead.

Proper resto druid buffbot with Gift of the Wild and Thorns actually bound to hot keys closest to the index finger, lol ffs. FU Blizzard, look at what you reduced the druid class to in vanilla and what they have to do in classic.
---
Stupid shit resto buffbots.
---
Finally a good answer!
---
Oof
---
Without dying.
---
Fire with Ice Block isn't really a "Fire Mage" given that you needed to go 21 pts in Frost to pick up Ice Block, if you also get Imp CoC then you're 24 frost which means you almost as much frost talents as fire talents, and often these elemental specs are 24/27 so actually \*more\* frrost than fire.  So really you're an Elemental mage. 
---
Personally, I think you undervalue frost barrier especially in early phases. When HP pools are so low, barrier is basically 1/3 of your health pool on a 30 second cooldown It's basically Arena Grand Master trinket on 30 second cooldown. Just because two classes can potentially purge (which is why you put up trash buffs and don't just auto-pilot frost barrier) doesn't invalidate it. 
---
I \*do\* think that Ignite/Barrier is quite strong (several of the mages in CDL used it to great success) so the meme that you \*have\* to be Arcane/Frost for PvP is certainly a meme. Personally I'd rather have Ice Barrier than Blast Wave but I think that's probably personal preference.
---
Part of the reason I dabbled into alts is by like 45-50 or so it really feels like things slow down. It's probably just the climbing xp requirements, but rested xp makes it all feel infinitely smoother. Since rested xp seems to be a percentage of your current level to me it seems like it's worth noticeably more the higher level you are, compared to say how quick it is to blow out levels prior to 20.
---
Obviously, do you call a sword hemmo rogue dagger rogue if they have one in their offhand?
---
Link your parses my guy who are you carrying
---
I did raid in Naxx, but I'm quick to qualify that as saying we weren't very successful there, and we never got past 4 horsemen before TBC hit.
---
Yep, pet respawns, but it didn't look like it was immediate. I killed the pet and reset because I fucked up. Ran back up to her and started eating and a few seconds later the pet came back.
---
Generalizations like these are only said as a means to reassure themselves that their beliefs are correct. It's pure fallacy.
---
i'm more surprised no one hit need. must be a guild run.
---
There’s a lot of different ways to make gold. Alchemy/herbalism is a good combo IMO. Sets you up for your own stuff for raid and you can sell the extras.
---
Hunter main, level 53, played since like the first week of Classic. AMA
---
That priest will get an eye eventually, you might not get staff or mageblade. Guild letting any priest roll on MC weapons is a huge problem, imo
---
Cenarian gloves and boots are actually pretty good. Sure you might sacrifice a small amount of +heals but if you live longer from having the extra stam then it's worth it.

I think in vanilla I ground out 57-60 in wpl-epl or brd runs for ony attune

I imagine so. having a hard time coming across recipes for flasks and elixirs, though. I think the only elixir I have right now is mongoose, and I don’t think I have ANY flask recipes :/

It was indeed - just some quick jump runs to try for Talisman, Rings and Satyr Bow
---
&gt; I've been enjoying Classic now for three months 
---
Alright Marty Mcfly, cool it.
---
People had no clue about itemization back then. Go look at comments on dungeon sets. Everyone jizzed hard about them but for the most part they are mediocre to bad. Of course content is going to be much easier now that optimal specs and optimal stat priority is known.
---
That plus the bosses supposedly being in a nerfed state. Certainly helps things along.
---
This is the correct answer,  but not the one that OP wants to hear.
---
Most guilds never made a serious try at Naxx, so I think it's accurate to let Vaelstraz keep that throne :)
---
TSG classic edition
---
Quiet grinds are great! I love the cave with level 45 ogres in the southwest corner of the badlands. Mining, orges and lots of cloth.
---
Everybody raided naxx and was rank 14
---
You can still pump out Scorchs and R1 Frostbolt while you wait for instants and/or a good times to cast R10, so I don’t really agree with your mobility comment. Frost/fire is definitely gonna be the most fun for BGs and world pvp for sure though.
---
Because there's really nothing interesting about this post. It's just a picture of a random level 60 at the character select screen.
---
If the druid doesn't have HoT's talented then just have them tank heal with a rank 7/8 HT and raid heal with rank 4
---
Yes they'll have to be quicker than everyone else and precast a lot to prevent overhealing but it let's the deeper resto-specced druids have free reign with their hots.
---
Just an ass ton of gold difference rn 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
A good chunk of damage comes from BS % damage not just the white hits (which i know telling rogues something like that will fool them into thinking their white hits wont still be 90% of their Damage but its not affected by dagger speed as directly)
---
It sounds like you force people to only get 1 piece of gear a week. Where if someone needs it for main spec and no one else needs it, you’ll give it to someone else for off spec. It’s a retarded system I’ve seen in the past. 
---
Is that what you’re referring to with +1?
---
The exception to no one being able to help is another hunter, but you can't both interact with the Demon. It is kinda considered cheating though :)
---
Damn straight
---
There is an Atlas loot classic and a separate plug in Atlas maps. They both are great for me, but I still have a few numbers on maps that aren't associated with bosses. I've decided this is an okay medium and have elected to not try and upgrade further.
---
When you dont have a lot of god to spare on the AH you buy low and sell slightly higher on high volume items.. the items that come in and go out of the AH all the time. Sometimes that is crafting mats, sometimes you can look out for BIS gear like "Shadow wrath" gear that you can buy for super cheap and make a small markup on. 
---
The issue is you are fighting AH cuts and 25G is absolutely not going to give you a good return unless you already have an idea of what you are doing. 
---
The real profit lies in items that are going to be very valuable in the future. look up crafting mats for great enchants in phase 2 or 3 or crafting mats phase 4... if it is shards or cloth that constantly flow in and out of the AH then dont bother, but like a herb that is super under valued now because the potions it make are trash now, but if something comes out soonish in phase 2 and 3 you have the potential to make a good chunk of change capitalizing on the rush to buy out the AH later.
---
Man you look almost like I do! Is that the BS chest from iron forge? It’s a lvl 15 and I’m still wearing it at lvl 34 !
---
Any specific items you’ve had luck with? I’m aware it might be server specific
---
You can cheese it with another priest who has the Eye of Divinity.
---
There's no difference, just inconsistent wording.
---
I had a massive box show up at my door. Had absolutely no idea wtf it was because I didn't order anything recently.
---
It was this thing. Completely forgot about it. Now the big massive white box is sitting on my floor taking up space. Almost makes me feel bad since I bought it thinking it was more tied to the Vanilla/Classic release and some nerd would probably jizz in his Apple jacks just to have it.  I'm not really into this collector fan-boy stuff so it's probably gonna sit on my floor until I put it in storage.
---
The box appears MUCH smaller in the photo but rest assured, it is the size of a large subwoofer speaker.
---
Sunk cost bad, pride of ownership usually not bad.
---
Creating things for yourself is generally wholesome and why so many games based on crafting/creating are popular.  See: Minecraft, Terraria.
---
Maybe a silly question. Once mages are fire spec for AQ/Naxx and go back to farm MC/BWL do they just use less than optimal frost spells in fire spec?
---
I wish we had use for shaman/pally gear while playing opposite faction.
---
Quickly leveled leatherworking to be able to salt shake - after that I kept all heavy leather (have like 50 stacks for thorium brotherhood rep) and rugged. Excess thick leather on Ah. Vendored all hides.
---
On horde, rogues can top meters due to the warriors being threat capped and better weapon progression.
---
Complete opposite for us, warlocks get a piece of gear every boss while the 6 rogues are still decked out in greens.
---
Holy paladin 9 days played to 60.

Tim...tranq shot? TIM?
---
If tank 100% go tauren. This is coming from an orc warrior
---
The general consensus I've heard is that Seal Fate Daggers is best with high crit. Most guides say 30% is preferred.
---
I would wager even with 20%, it is still a damn good build, though.
---
at this stage its not achievable
---
I agree with so many of those points man.    With regards to questing and farming gear, anyone who quests with 5 friends, like all the time, knows how challenging this can be.
---
Thanks for enightening me on the PvP side too.  Its as challenging as I thought it would be.  Basically your weakness is when you're flanked and hit from behind?  More challenging than 5 friends, because you don't have that dynamic of having 5 individual minds in one group.
---
As for quest mobs, specifically low drop items.  You have to kill 5 times as many don't you?  Might suck for others, but its still like having another party of 5 in the same area.  Exactly the same to other players around you except you can't be as efficient as a party of 5 "friends", I guess - so not actually as bad when one thinks about it.
---
Pretty cute. Should have ended with dinging one level higher.
---
Miss (8.41% +/- 0.95%) unfortunately isn’t enough samples to resolve between three prevailing theories on base miss chance for +3 mobs (8%, 8.6%, and 9%), but it’s encouraging that there isn’t a huge surprise here.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/news=291996/not-a-bug-combat-table-values-in-classic-wow
---
Literally from blizzard beta testing wow classic and tuning combat to replicate Vanilla. Mean miss rate is 8.41%, meaning you need 9 to cap. Quit your trolling.
---
Not surprised at all that we’re being downvoted for saying that not all women are the same lmao
---
I’m a 45 lock thinking about dropping one of the gathering profs I’ve been leveling with to go for robe of the void. Is that a good move? 
---
Does this approach make sense? 
---
- Drop skinning and keep mining
---
- Max tailoring and craft robe
---
- Drop tailoring and go engineering
---
Nice, I might check that out.  I think I used Healbot in my limited time healing in WoW originally, but it's been like a decade since then so I had forgotten what exactly it was that I used.
---
Is there an addon that retroactively tells me what my most mana efficient ranks for each heal are? Based on my current gear/talents?
---
What item was it and what where the two people it was betweens current setup and how much effort have they both put into the guild? You wont answer these questions because you are likely in the wrong
---
Enchanting is not bound by level in vanilla so you can do it at any level. You’re bang on the money, dis high level greens and sell the mats. What server and region are you on?
---
Nah, r14 was more about time commitment than anything else. (Or account sharing). There was a hardcore pvp guild on my server that had pretty much all the r14s on the server horde side and they would rotate the rank. Then one person started to get ahead by being online like 24hours a day. Supposedly he had a brother or roommate and they would do shifts. They managed to get r14 3 weeks in a row even in pugs by just outlasting the premades.
---
Shout out to bear tanks! We are kind of hybrids too! No shield means we have to get used to saving ourselves with heals etc while leveling.
---
So when we dungeon we should know how to use our kit well.
---
Had a seriously big pull in ZF one day. The warlock asspulled 2 mobs and 2 Pats joined as well.
---
So we had about 12 mobs on us. Halfway through the fight and half the mobs gone the priest goes oom. I am about half HP. Pop out of bear and warstomp. Use the healthstone from said lock and use innervate on the priest. A quick regrowth rejuv combo after and back into bear. Had a comment about ththe nice "stomp stone" combo and a few seconds later the priest chimes in "wtf I was wondering why I had mana again to heal. Pro druid holy shit."
---
It's nice having that extra utility and a utilities that require timing and skill to use. 
---
We bears bring more than just slightly higher threat than a warrior..
---
&gt; no gear requirement for Mara  
---
&gt;few easily accessible pre-BiS  
---
One of these is not like the other. I would love to see you try doing it with no gear. Rotgrip will absolutely tank 2 Dooms if you dont have the spellpower, he is extremely gear dependant and thats why very few warlocks do him. Being SM/ruin requires you to have *more* spell power than DS. Your VW will typically die more often than not because he takes so much damage when she fears+AOE and you dont have a good way to have him heal up any damage he takes.
---
Awesome! I’ll give this a try. Thanks bro.
---
You can disenchant everything with a level 5 that has enchanting. No level required for disenchants.
---
1) Per my guilds hunters, they make more gold much faster and easier in Mara.
---
2) RFC or VC? How new of a tank do you mean?
---
Oh gotcha yeah those POMs are stronk
---
Respec! 
---
Raiding is expensive with respeccing.
---
Are you actually looking at logs or just quickly looking at a number to make a point? Check to see if he was on dispell duty on that same fight. 
---
Again, your argument is flawed. By your definition no one should play druid at all, as it's a completely unneeded class. 
---
You are trying to give advice to the casual player but using the competitive meta to validate your argument. Do you not see how incongruous those two things are? 
---
A casual boomkin player can easily perform OR outperform a casual mage on a single target fight. The mage obviously brings other benefits that the boomkin cannot, like good aoe and winters chill and whatnot. The same can be said for ALL feral druids, yet you yourself are playing that spec. 
---
Your stance is just clearly hypocritical, and frankly misinformed. The casual player does not need to concern themselves with the competitive meta, which is what this post is about.
---
Edit: I have yet to see you prove to me that boomkins cannot do solid dps or even less than viable dps. Meanwhile I've shown you that not only is it doable, it's beyond easy.
---
I'm pretty sure there's no difference, just the + spell damage with no 'effects' distinguished is printed on the item as being shorter for the sake of brevity since it appears as a white stat.
---
I left my pet's growl on this time around entirely because all the 'tanks' I had really were just ravager warriors spinning around dying often.
---
Looks like he did you a favor by blocking you
---
Send it to me, I’ll hold on to it till you get more space :P
---
I already said it's better, but you said it's "by far the best". Back your claim up. You clearly don't know shit about hit tables, not surprised you can't back this up either.
---
Umm no it doesn’t, if your judging dungeon dps, your a nerd ass idiot, if your judging one persons DPS in a 40 man raid, ur a nerd ass idiot
---
Thanks for the thoughtful response man.
---
I am super impressed with his punctuation though.
---
Watch to the markets. A lot of resources and consumables flucatate in price. Stuff like rune cloth stacks go to almost 1g during primetime. Same with fish. Fish prices are higher near raid reset days.
---
There is no real balanced build for raiding and farming.  You want all except one mage to run Arcane Power and then one is the Winter's Chill guy who will have much much lower personal DPS from going deep into Frost.
---
Why is that? Because I honestly don't know why it's bad, especially with the 4 set bonus.
---
that seems like something the guy who I wasn't following before, but definitely am following now would say.
---
Get out of that guild. No reason he shouldve rolled on that. Thats the dumbest thing Ive seen on here in a while
---
Wicked!
---
You are not the asshole here
---
Is Azure Silk gear good for leveling?
---
In my guild fury warriors that only do ~400 dps are considered slacking. But then the worst dps in our raids are still top30% in the world and most are in the top5%.
---
Do you guys recommend anything special with auctioneer? I’ve never really used it but is it pretty straight forward out of the box? Or will I have to configure it to make it useful?
---
How "worth it" is having Arcane Concentration for the clearcast procs?  I'm sitting at 57 with a [deep frost build](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/230001--05350233132351351) and went for Winter's Chill (because I like critting, it's fun) over investing those points in the arcane tree. Like every other mage I see, I'm chugging a lot in dungeons but I can't tell if my mana management could be better.
---
Context: I mainly spend my time AOE grinding and running dungeons. Guild is not raiding at the moment so being competitive on meters in raids is not a big priority (I realize there are better builds for that, anyway).
---
It depends on your current spell power and crit rate, but safe to assume it's between 7-8.
---
Sounds like a guild run from OP's comments
---
Or if you’re a priest you can mindvision into the room to check for spawns.
---
This comment makes the most sense to me. I always felt like I was good enough to know i was bad (and i raided Naxx40!). Like, sure in a geared run your boomchicken and ret aren't doing as much as your mages/warriors/rogues, but in the non bleeding edge &amp; hardcore guilds its not a huge difference unless you bring a significant number of them to matter.
---
anything strong dps like mageblade because "mages scale better".
---
I was purposely exaggerating
---
I got rank 10 maybe 11 if I remember correctly and yea, it wasnt super challenging but 2 days a week I played with premades for like 14hrs each day and the rest of the week was casual pugging. After 11 or so is the real challenge.
---
Is this a joke I'm too Druid to understand?
---
I'm not currently druid CL but I was in the past. What you could try is have the druids set up their raid frames so they can see if a target already has rejuv on it. That should resolve the problem if they have triple digit IQs but in the off chance it doesn't...
---
if they're still overwriting each other's hots, find out which one of them has the highest +healing and tell the other druids that the guy with the most +healing is the only one who's allowed to cast rejuv.
---
I would recommend all healers use Luna Unit Frames.
---
I'm in the same boat, I kind of have to roll Tauren for aesthetics and nostalgia, but also I still think they might be best for the style of group PvP I engage in, with a small coordinated group of friends. (Priest, shaman, and mage).
---
Tauren, due to their size, simply attract more attention being more likely to be attacked initially by most players, and for the healers to be ignored longer. As long as I'm being attacked, I'm getting infinite rage and more enrage uptime, and my healers are healing and dispelling me. This also allows my group to free cast for longer and blow things up. For every second I'm being attacked instead of the healer, it's significantly increasing our chances of winning the fight, which is important for uneven matchups. I've found this to be true, after also playing many different races for warrior (undead, Orc, Human). I used to carry around stacks of winterfall firewater and other size increasing items to draw even more attention to myself lol.
---
The melee range also makes a big difference in a lot of situations, and so does the stun for interrupting heals. Orcs are good, but Tauren have a lot of "hidden" racials haha.
---
That’s a buggy quest
---
&gt; If you're already at 98% to hit, you'd need to be dealing ~705 dps already for the Star of Mystaria to be worth it.
---
Until BWL there's only 5 pieces of +spell hit gear, three of which are equippable in two slots for shamans (mysteria, 2 belts, a mage piece, and a lock piece). Looks like they ~~don't even have +hit talents~~ only get +3 from talents (ouch), so their max is 88% (87% as a base for comparison) in phase 1, 89% if they hit rank 14 in phase 2, 95% in phase 3 (BWL), and they can't cap until ZG in phase 4.
---
We do this as well.
---
yes and no...loot council deciding which classes to roll.
---
Yea they must be complete morons not knowing what there doing alt all in the gaming industry..
---
They should hire someone like you and fix all there problems.. LMFAO
---
Now that’s what I call yikes
---
Frost Oil has always been a decent money maker for me as its a reagent for several items. Ghost shrooms sell for about 1g on my server,  but there are only a couple good spots to gather those.  Other than that, I feel like the return on farming mats for alchemy isn't too substantial at the moment, unless I'm missing something.  I see a lot of people hoarding Black Lotus, with the expectation that demand will increase as more content rolls out.
---
Because you’re trying to do ony with as little people as possible to maximize gear, so it gets quite hard. Can’t believe there’s people actually doing 40 man onys in here 😂
---
Yeah. I vaguely remember some parts of it. But this is like... vaaaaague. BWL is like a haze of wanding for mana rotations and being polymorphed into a giraffe. And god don't ask me to remember AQ other than like, not chaining the Cthun chain lightning and our twin emps tank (the warrior not the warlock) DCing all the time. Naxx all I remember is we had our assigned groups for cleansing and MCing the dudes and our four 4HM groups and the polarity addon pointing where to move. That's like, it. Sum total of everything.
---
Should I always try to go for +healing gear as a priest while leveling up(lvl 20 now) or go for INT , spirit? Also is engineer worth to pick up for the goggles?
---
Wait if you're following... how are you preventing him from progressing in Mining... 🤔
---
It’s like “well I didn’t even notice I was following you. But now, watch me follow you”
---
Don’t forget the North East corner of the inside of the inn where people can stand in and nuke people inside the inn and the guards will not aggro them. Not an Exalted thing, saw a Warlock camp them, get Feared out and the guards jumped him.
---
They did fix a lot of other things which were broken from vanilla.  So it looks like they fixed that as well.
---
When you kill a faction leader is there a drop, or any real benefit to doing it?
---
PvP is all about short bursts of damage as opposed to sustained damage over time. Bite and claw is good for that purpose.
---
For soloing I turn off claw and use growl instead on keybind.
---
We'll see, barbarian
---
Stalking breaks the ToS? 🤔
---
Deleted second question, but I meant at max level. I phrased it weirdly but I wasn't sure how much more difficult (if at all) DM was compared to the other dungeons. I haven't actually started classic yet lol been busy
---
Post your macro, ill fix it for you
---
&gt; 24-30 fire + 21 frost is a fire mage. period.
---
So why does everyone call that "elemental" even back in Vanilla when Vurtne ran it, that was called elemental mage. Calling yourself "Fire" when you have just as many frost talents/abilities is disingenuous. You're also picking up Frostbite and shatter both of which are fundamental to Frost mage. You'll also use R1 frostbolt and Cone of Cold both which benefit from talents in Frost tree, really you're using almost as many frost spells as fire spells and almost as many frost talents as fire talents how is this *not* "Elemental"? You're trying to rebrand something which already has a name. 
---
&gt; You are vastly underestimating how frequently that barrier is going to be dispelled. 
---
And yet every single mage (including Blizzcon winners, multi-R1 mages, who did hundreds of duels in practice) for the CDL all went Ice Barrier. Greatwizard, NorthTheMage, OhhGee all also go Ice Barrier. Now you can say all these people are scrubs but at least that's some actual data. It would strike me as strange that people who are paid to play this game for PvP all unanimously and independently decided that Ice Barrier.
---
At this point we're arguing over sematics of "fire mage" vs "elemental mage" I've already agreed that Elemental Mage is perfectly valid, I just don't agree with calling something which is defined by being a hybrid between Frost and Fire a purely "fire" spec.
---
While I did raid Naxx, I only managed to get 3 boss kills before BC rolled out (Razuvious, Anub and Faerlina) and the rest of them way later, at 70. As for PvP? Highest I got was rank 6.
---
I do make known that I did play on vanilla and remember (most) about its dungeons, mechanics and problems some classes had (totems only 20 yards unless talented, warlock soul shards, hybrid tax, etc) but I only mention it when asked directly in game.
---
Horde or alliance on boulderfist? I was horde in TheMafia / Martha Stewart.
---
Leatherworkers craft it.
---
Roommates or family sharing was relatively common for high ranking. Same computer so same ip.
---
Thank u for the advice, will do!
---
What was the name of the addon that's been recently posted here, which scans LFG (or other?) chat for certain key words to find dungeon groups more easily?
---
What about farming outside of professions? Obviously I won’t have the farming power a mage has, but is there another thing to grind? Like fish, etc?
---
Also keep in mind that blizzard doesn't crit.
---
&gt; As I said, people were saying the same about MC
---
Everyone knew MC was a joke, still there's going to be a huge portion of the playerbase who will never kill rag.
---
&gt; You will also say the same about BWL once it is cleared.
---
No, no it's not. There's a MASSIVE difference between MC and BWL.
---
MC was built in a week, LITERALLY A WEEK. Re-used assets, and kobbled together fights with basic mechanics per boss.
---
There are 0 dps races 0 gearchecks in MC. (Even rag can be done with 0 fire resist) BWL has the second boss with a rather massive dps check.
---
The problem with this is, you’re stacking str and agi, you’re going to be low on mana to start with, and gotta run through it to keep your damage up.  I think if you changed your stat priority a bit, you may be able to fill this role very well.  
---
Hit/crit-&gt;str/AP-&gt;stam-&gt;int-&gt;agi-&gt;spell power.
---
Look to the spell power gear (foreman’s head protector, Spiderfang carapace, entrenching boots, Earthslag spaulders, spritecaster cape, burst of knowlege) in BRD as the starting point for your gear set going forward, then fill with hit and crit like ornate mithril.
---
There's always that "kid" who brags about his past vanilla experience.
---
I have trouble finding a spot to level from 31 onwards. I am a troll priest  
---
My plan right now is farming the harpies in 1k needles.  
---
The crux in my situation is I have 22 gold right now and in 9 level I wanna have my mount. So what is a relativly efficient method to level while gaining gold?
---
You can get buffed to the gills but you cant be helped once it starts. Having that bow was a sign that the hunter was able to do something hard, separating that hun**ter** from the mass of hun**tards**.
---
I wish I could be up there.
---
Yup, make sure you switched your twitch add on list to classic.
---
Mine defaults to retail every time I search for stuff.
---
&gt;Again, your argument is flawed. By your definition no one should play druid at all, as it's a completely unneeded class.
---
There is a difference between saying "that's not the single most optimal build, don't do it" (what you're suggesting I'm saying) and saying "hey, a few builds are just utter trash compared to other options" (what I'm actually saying).
---
&gt;You are trying to give advice to the casual player but using the competitive meta to validate your argument. Do you not see how incongruous those two things are?
---
Actually, I think the incongruity is in your argument.
---
You're arguing that if someone trys hard enough they can make a meme spec good.  So...in other words, if someone puts in lots of time and effort to gear up just right and get the right buffs, they can make it viable.  But...that's what a competitive player does, not a casual.
---
So are you advising tryhards or casuals?
---
&gt;A casual boomkin player can easily perform OR outperform a casual mage on a single target fight.
---
This is just not true.  Show me any real statistics to back up your anecdotal opinion and I'll concede.
---
Show me aggregate data that shows boomkins matching mages.
---
&gt;The same can be said for ALL feral druids, yet you yourself are playing that spec.
---
I'm playing a 0/30/21 feral OT/healer, not a dps.  I don't want to try to emulate Schedo.
---
&gt;The casual player does not need to concern themselves with the competitive meta, which is what this post is about.
---
The only way a boomkin player can be moderately reasonable on dps is to fully gear out and bring consumes and bring buffs...which isn't a casual approach either.
---
So why are you advising casuals to play a spec that requires so much work?
---
Ummm scholo should not be done by anyone less than 58.
---
Honestly I think your healing lead doesn’t understand druids. Or his understanding comes from later expansions. 
---
Requiring you to keep regrowth on a tank is bad. Regrowth is VERY mana hungry, and should be used sparingly, if at all, at this stage of play. 
---
Expecting you to keep rejuv and regrowth on at all times and give away your innervate is just bad healing leadership.
---
You can pick bag, quiver, or ammo pouch.
---
I mean I do too, I've just been having horrible RNG lol.  
---
Skullflame dropped yesterday and a hunter and I from guild tied with 96 and he won the hidden roll lol.
---
Thanks this is accurate. Never realized that since I don’t stand in front of them
---
Yeah no need to be decked out. The level gap is big enough you'll be fine
---
He has misused commas
---
Spelladin is the new ret meta
---
How long did that take
---
As a levelling tank, your #1 objective isnt XP, cool loot or a fast clear.
---
It's identifying people you want to do dungeons with again.
---
Put good dps and good healers on your friends list. When you want to do a dungeon, hit up your friends list before PUGing. 
---
If you have 3 out of 5 already knowing how to work well with a pally tank, then the last member will figure it out.
---
I know of this video only because it was featured on tosh.0
---
Im also on herod and it cost me less than half the price for my offhand than my main hand originally, and give it time, not everyone is geared yet. Itll drop once the demand slows
---
I remember being able to leash, but I started playing just prior to 1.12. And I was leveling a warlock. It is possible what I was actually doing back then was sending the pet in, burn down one mob, then flee. It's very similar to pull one and leash. Enough so that after 15 years I cannot be certain which way it worked. If Blizz says it worked this way, I see no reason not to believe them. Unless someone can find a dated video clearing showing 1.12 retail and the leashing method.
---
Leather workers craft an 8 slot not 10. I’m referring to the medium shot pouch on wowhead.
---
Engineer is worth it if you plan on PVP-ing a lot, not for goggles. For Spec, level as shadow and you can still heal just fine. Don't respec to healing until you're like 55 and ready to heal full time, and even then take some DPS talents for questing.
---
For gearing:
---
Level 1-52: Prioritize Spirit, then Int is equal to Stamina.
---
Level 52-60 (Blackrock Depths), start looking for +Healing and Int gear.
---
Do people change spec everytime they raid or is there a good hybrid build out there? Arcane/frost seems the best raising spec but outside of raids it doesn't feel great.
---
 Just /gquit. Preferably all of you at once, just to make a point.
---
Save the progression bragging for when they drop BC classic.
---
&gt; Everyone knew MC was a joke
---
Will become:
---
&gt; Everyone knew BWL was a joke
---
Sorry, that cannot be taken seriously. BWL will be cleared just as easily.
---
Just don’t get upset when a hardcore guild doesn’t take you :)
---
My guild requires certain classes to spec certain ways.  My guild requires potions/food/and flasks. I love this competitive aspect.
---
There’s a place for everyone :)
---
My favorite class in the game is boomkin
---
Yeah but if you've cleared naxx to get the tanking sword I don't think it matters what race you are either.
---
I'm aware. But like for everything else there's a learning curve :p
---
I thought you got a sense of pride from buying Darth Vader with IRL money?
---
“Bucko” hahahaha
---
How to decide spot on list?
---
Wtf kind of guild is this ?? Bruh everyone got mc on farm, and it will be on farm for months before a new raid drops. There is no need to be an asshole like that.
---
Blocked
---
OP is one of those guys? lol
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6802/sword-of-omen](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6802/sword-of-omen)
---
totally worth it and also the clearclasting in the arcane is great for saving mana when farming
---
In the time it took him to write that essay, I mined 6 Copper nodes.
---
These super small amount of text doesn’t prove anything they could’ve left for any reason. need to show more
---
It’s actually easier to just kite Silithus guy around the stairs by AQ gate. If you never wing clip him he never fears you and you don’t need a warlocks help.
---
I have the boots, but the amount of healing you lose really isn't all that significant when it gets down to it. I'm not "lazy to not get my BiS", it's just that the power gain isn't really all that significant. There's just not that much incentive to farm the gloves for example
---
3 piece cenarian set doesn't affect my healing, but it saves me mana on thorns buffing, which ends up being way more significant than some +heals
---
Depends, I would say for sure use the blue set over T1. 
---
Might be best for a mix of blue pvp gear and T2 depending on what you have available
---
Yep believe what you you want.
---
Let's just ignore over 10 years of history of private servers, where guilds fail to progress.
---
The majority of the playerbase will never see the inside of naxx. That's reality.
---
If you respec tank (deep prot or fury prot) it should take appx 10 min to make a group for anything, and you get to pick who to bring, so you can stack things in your favor. If you have a good healer in discord/comms with you’ll wipe very rarely if ever. Ask away!
---
Lol he's gonna send a very angry letter to blizzard
---
Supervising at work was 1000000000x easier than being an officer in a medium/high end raiding guild (I couldn't even imagine being the GM, Christ Almighty)
---
At work, you can (usually) give constructive criticism and have nice feedback going both ways to achieve some bigger goals and get the job done.
---
Online?
---
People just shut down, there's zero respect/responsibility; even adults will turn into bitchy children online. It's rediculous. 
---
I'm so happy that I'm a regular old raider now. Fuck that old business.
---
Any mob you can kill quickly that drop items that vendor for a lot. I know that's pretty vague but they are out there, whelps in Dustwallow or pirates in Tanaris.  Also fishing in Azshara can yield a wide variety of fish and then some...
---
Well, I don't know if there's "not much point" being HOTW because it embraces the versatility of being a druid. It also saves enormously on respec costs, if you aren't forced to respec away to Moonglow or Swiftmend for raid night :X
---
I haven't specced in Leader of the Pack in quite some time. My HOTW build goes with Nature's Swiftness instead for just sheer utility. The main tank is a bear tank who is providing Leader of the Pack but as a I understand it, it's only buffing his immediate group which is comprised of other tanks, a warlock, and something else.
---
Yes I've seen the video. And I'm starting to think that you will only really be able to get away with HOTW if you already have several set pieces from the raid and/or are in a position where you kinda don't have mana issues anymore. I'll see.
---
My guild has 1 tank druid and 1 resto druid on the raid team.
---
This wasn't because of being picky with who got in
---
This was due to no other druids being raid ready anywhere near us wanting to raid. 
---
That resto druid is getting so geared lol.
---
BUCKO.
---
I remember getting Rank 14 and it wasn't really much skill but coordination and a lot of game play. As for Nax, every major guild had players retire till the BC was release. Since most of the people doing the test were claiming greens better than Nax gear. So most of the major guilds had to pug from each other and it was a tough learning curve. Everything had to be perfect.
---
Whenever I see the 5 stack lock multibox, I know I'm dead. I just try to get a fear in (priest). I've set them back about as much time as my run back until those PVP trinkets get in the game.
---
God, I miss pudding pops, those things were so good. The vanilla and vanilla chocolate swirl were the best. Why the hell don’t they make those anymore?!?
---
Yeah, generally don't have to worry about it, and tbh I thought the only mini-dragon that did it was firemaw and learned about the others when I looked dit up to check myself.
---
What the fuck
---
In Soviet Russia, mobs skin you
---
Yeah, I'm leveling 2 classes at once and my lock is only 41, but my guild already has like...6 or 7 warlocks in their regular raiding group. It's been dawning on me lately that I'll probably be smart to look for a new guild at 60 if I ever want to get anything. Our guild uses dkp too so I'll be hugely behind on that too.
---
3 set only saves you mana if you casting in combat... lol. Whether 10 min buff or 15 min buff it doesn’t affect your in combat mana
---
Edit. Boots I agree have a negligible difference.  But every other piece is pretty trash compared to other dungeon blues
---
Leatherworkers can craft more than 8 slot.  They can craft them all through the ranges, up to 16  slot as well too, just so you know.
---
I suggest just making some bars/was only viable in combat or mouseover . Still get that clean look while doing other things.
---
Yeah humans never judge others, you're right.
---
Don’t even bother, this guy insists that the yellow hit cap is always 9%
---
I know. It lasts 12 seconds, after which point I refresh it, it the moment it falls off. But that's what I'm being asked to do. And innvervate the main healer, the priest.
---
Why join a discussion if you block anyone who responds to you?
---
My biggest question here is what kind of sick bastard multiboxes ~4 warlocks
---
Moonglow spec definitely opens up your mana pool, and your heals will be more effective as well since you can snag the bonus healing talents.
---
Once your +healing is higher, the healing talents are less useful (since they work off the base heal of the spell).  Your +int will also be going up which makes the HOTW spec more appealing.
---
Enh Shaman. 
---
Windfury. 
---
Most fun I have ever had in this game. 
---
Im not saying others dont have fun AOE farming. I find it mind numbing. If you do it right its a complete snooze fest  to me
---
Time is money friend, laps of the zones that spawn black lotus, gathering anything and everything you see.
---
Just used in case you wanted to get cute with me 😉 cant joke about salt man theres alot of slugs out here.
---
If you can get the recipes, do so. Plus, as many mats as you can. I'd stockpile until we can see if flasks sell well or not.
---
Right now I am making the most money just selling herbs straight. Auctionator is great at letting me know prices per herb and stack, plus historical data.
---
I’m playing with onboard graphics rn because my card fried. It only freezes sometimes so it’s all good.
---
Same thing with correcting spelling and grammar. If you establish that you're very smart and the person you're arguing with is very stupid then you don't have to actually listen to them, because of course you're right, look how much smarter you are than them.
---
You don't need pots on ragnaros as melee...
---
Also as a sidenote, DON'T "HELP" SHADOWPRIESTS FINISH OFF MOBS 
---
We need our spirit taps yo!
---
&gt; you’re literally limiting your own and the enjoyment of others by acting like parrots to a flawed ideal
---
Thanks for telling me how to enjoy the game
---
I really hate when my teammates try their best, that really sucks doesn't it /s
---
I dropped skinning for tailoring and power leveled it for robe of the void. I would recommend starting to accumulate cloth ahead of time, or just gradually buying it and stocking up. I did it the wrong way (consciously, I just wanted to get robe of the void fast) and just basically bought out all of the cloth for a few hours until I had enough. Of course, prices basically shot up and I was paying way more than I should have been since I needed to buy like 900 runecloth. Also, try to buy your runecloth patterns ahead of time, since you can only really level from like 250-300 with purchased patterns.
---
That doesnt sound fun.
---
He's referencing a change from 2 days ago.
---
I went for 3 and have no regrets
---
“Ah welcome to Orgrimmar! Have you come to serve th- *AIEEEEEEEEEEEE*”
---
Quest. Farming is not efficient for gold in your 30s. Most people don't get their  mount until 42/44, income goes up a lot at 40
---
I mean that still means you polished the battlegrounds and you have some insights on strategies that works.
---
It confirms my experience, truly.
---
Have an Alchemist and a Cook carry the most needed consumables so people have no excuse for not having them and can get them without having to hit town.
---
Also have Repair Bots, for similar reasons.
---
In a raid, how can you tell when other people need cleansing? In a party I can  see when someone has a debuff. In a raid I just see a huge square of people that takes up half my screen, which I hate. No idea if people are debuffed or not. I am a mage if it makes a difference.
---
69 friends. Nice
---
Aren't those rings pure garbage? Who uses them?
---
We recently started raising together recently for the past 3 weeks so up until now we’ve been doing one loot per person and I’m lucky enough to be in a raid where there’s only 2-3 rogues(including me) so less competition. Ive heard talks that we are going to loot council soon though. 
---
Warriors roll on 1hand swords all the time in my raid (lost vishkag last week to a fury warrior in my guild) so it’s pretty much if you need it, you roll on it MS&gt;OS.
---
You know what they say? "When no one agrees with you try a different forum"

Even in this post every person was rank 12-14 and raided naxx. But ofc they are bad at game so it is ok to lie.
---
Not always.  Technically "best for the raid" means giving pieces to people for whom it's the biggest upgrade.  So greens get replaced before prebis.  The problem is that creates a perverse incentive system where people who don't do any work to gear their character get rewarded before those who do, so nobody would feel like gearing up and performing.
---
So you actually, in a way, want to slightly feed more gear to the grinders who got their gear, show up and perform.  Good raid looting rewards that effort over the raid.
---
So I'd say overall it's a balance between the two.
---
Though pure nepotism of a small cabal of people gearing themselves with no respect to the rest of the guild is bullshit.
---
I think if I'm going to try to get away with using my HOTW spec (at least for the bosses leading up to Rag), then I had better equip one of the belts sitting in my bank which has some +Int. I'm still trying to get a belt with +healing power, will be chasing the belt from Dire Maul East.
---
But anyways thank you for that, I guess I have to remember that well, I'm giving someone else one of my most powerful abilities so he can shine, and not me.
---
He was probably the kind of kid who reminded teachers they forgot to give homeworks in highschool 2 min before the bell rang.
---
It saves you drink time, which means more time for outputting heals. If it gets me even one heal off that can help prevent the tank from dying even once in a dozen raids, it's worth it over a negligible amount of plus heals
---
You only need enough +heals to make Rank 4 heal nicely. After that, it doesn't really matter, especially since I spend most of my time putting out thicker tank heals
---
I literally linked you Blizzard's very own research showing what the hit cap is you fucking dolt. You can't even do your own research.
---
Grats:)!
---
Texas chainsaw massacre vibes.
---
nobody:
---
if you're friendly with the argent dawn in its the bulwark. But that means you have to not aggro the horde NPCs while selling.
---
Regardless of straight damage output (which amounts to, what, a few minutes more or less of clear time?), I would pretty much always take a Druid over a Rogue.  Utility is underrated.
---
I've run it a handful of times and have never seen one.
---
wow is not a single player game. you cant complete raids as a single player. the success of the whole team is more important then each individuals particular feelings. in other words you have to be a team player. When it doesn't really matter and you have content on farm go wild. When the success of 39 other people depends on your actions sorry but you kinda have to suck it up.  
---
Classic unfortunately has specs that are just bad for progression raiding.
---
Don’t over complicate it with all this tryhard bullshit that some people think is the end all be all of the game.
---
This shit is easy, you can do it in greens. Get in, kill your dragons, get out, have fun.
---
Yeah I don't get this I hear on reddit that mages have problem finding groups. I play on a high pop/queue server and every group I've ask to joined I get an invite to.
---
Or Shaman
---
Sounds like WoW sexting
---
When I watched this and  Dancin - AronSmith was playing and fits very well with this xD

---
I would say much of the raid is. But the funniest thing is, on our Rag kill a few nights ago, we were around 5-6 attempts in, and all Fire pots were totally exhausted.
---
Everyone then slapped on their FR gear, and we killed him. My guild is not where yours is yet. Yes like any other guild we farm 5-man dungeons for gear and get everyone as much as we possibly can. All the bosses are on farm status with the exception of Rag at this point.
---
But I'm glad to see a fellow druid also want to raid using HoTW/NS spec. Based on what you're saying, I should hopefully be able to get away with doing likewise, at least for the first raid night where we clear up to Shazzrah. I am joining the raid relatively late to the party.
---
I've been doing it relentlessly in Booty Bay since level 37 - 52 (translation, 3-4 weeks)
---
No warning, no ban. Loads of fun when you end up starting an all out war in the city! I've had plenty of people outsmart me and shut me down. Get creative and find a way to stop them instead of visciously smacking away at your keyboards hoping a GM will just "stop" it. Anyone can do this, so why not get your 60 buddies to help and show the opposing faction whose better?
---
Even if you didn't do it in Vanilla, Naxx was handed out like candy in WotLK.
---
Hope he finds a new guild that raids MC with 9 people so he can get all the class loot.
---
FIVE rets? Is that from all the servers combined?
---
I have whispered people who were surrounded by corpses before to ask if they are skinning.  I figure if they aren't then no harm in faming.
---
most savy players you meet were probably on private servers
---
Huh, that's how I have done it five or so times now, wonder if there is a way to make it happen every time. Good to know thanks!
---
Welcome to last month.

Or they'll go play a game where they can.
---
True, forgot about repair bots. I'm gonna add that.
---
I don't want to be rude or anything, your numbers (9%) are correct as far as 300 weapskill vs 315 defense are concerned. The issue is that a raiding combat rogue will at LEAST have 305 (310 as a human sword rogue) which negates a bunch of the penalties.
---
I'll just quote the rogue discord:
---
&gt;Hit rating requirements:
---
When fighting a level 63 mob (all bosses in classic wow) the hit cap is effectively 9% for yellow swings. This is due to the bosses defense skill of 315 and your weapon skill of 300, the delta (change) between the bosses' defense and your weapon skill is 15 and this adds a 1% hit modifier. If your weapon skill is 305, that delta between weapon skill and defense is gone and the hit modifier is no longer in place, making the yellow hit cap 8%. In addition to 305 weapon skill negating the hit modifier, it was also determined that it gives you +2% hit, making the yellow hit cap 6%.
---
Considering nearly all rogues should be picking up precision in the combat talent tree for PvE this mean that the hit needed from gear to hit yellow cap is effectively 1%. Yes, you read that correctly - currently data shows in classic wow the yellow hit cap is 6% and that means with 5/5 precision you only need 1% hit to hit cap from your gear.
---
What in the shit
---
I could also see 5 rogues being relatively fast for questing. Not much sustain but you could burst mobs so fast you'd hardly take damage. Not to mention you can sneak past areas as a group so for some "go collect this item" quests, you can just stealth/sprint and be done with it.
---
Wouldn't work for dungeons though lol
---
I mean you only have thorns on one person?
---
3 tanks, sometimes 1-3 offtanks depending on fight, that's up to 6 buffs every 10 min. Since it's good practice to refresh when there's a min or two left, more like 8-9 min. 
---
The set bonus changes this to 13-14 min. Almost half the time and mana, which isn't insignificant. 6 globals, maybe half my mana.
---
But hey, I'm sure you can still rationalize it to be insignificant over +heals that might give you 1% more total healing.
---
Um, no. 
---
If you mean discuss how to respond to specific situations sure. But that’s more collaborative so both sides learn something (or one side of it is a more experienced player with a less experienced one). But why talk shit over voice comms when you can just duel or fight it out.
---
Back in Vanilla, only 2 People. YES 2 PEOPLE in the ENTIRE SERVER were the only ones in my server to have them.
---
You are doing it right. Too many people think "Rank Has its Privileges" even if they only earned their "rank" by being the first people in the guild on its creation. 
---
On behalf of all your warlocks and everyone else in your guild thank you for being a good example and taking the extra time to make sure it is a positive experience for all
---
Its very time intensive, you can go 4 hours without getting any, search yourtube for black lotus farming guide, you may find it useful.  I currently have around 25 black lotus saved and complete bank and alts full of herbs and a VERY comfortable bank balance.  The thing with herb/alch you never make huge lumps of cash, more a consistent and steady income as well as reducing your own costs and farm efficiency.
---
Materially grey
---
I meet those criteria, but I am now only level 44 in classic. lol
---
I can’t give up the 3% crit, 31/20 still loves you
---
I think they should of added a class that copies the abilities but with a different lore and visuals to it. Shamans could of been some kind holy monk for the alliance. paladins could of been some kind of elemental warrior or warlock/death knight style warrior but with the same moves as a alliance paladin just different visuals and lore.
---
People who put in the work to farm their pre bis always get prio imo. It's definitely a balance. Ive passed people over on loot who didnt bother to get their bloodvine when i was raiding on pservers.
---
Orcs are also animals, you swine!
---
Just  go and report them. On my server they did in also in the inn... and near the noggenfogger guy on the barrels. Just mass report EVERYONE and move on, which is kinda hard when you have to quest there, but try it :)
---
I would give award to your post, but I'm out of gold.
---
Anyway you have my full support.
---
Hybrid spec and agility as warrior!
---
Is having a macro of cackle mandatory for horde?
---
Holy god those players were super bad LOL  dwarf attacks with no mana, next priest comes in and hardcasts starshards mage pollies on a fear and 2 SWPs LOL
---
But orcs aren’t humans
---
I’ll give that a shot man, thank you.
---
Walk up to the UBRS door and spam /tar jed for a minute or two. I think you can target him from the entrance too at a certain point in his patrol, but the window in which you can do this is very short.
---
I don't think I'm over-complicating anything and this certainly isn't tryhard bullshit, if anything you're over-simplifying it. Maybe experienced guilds can clear MC in greens but most pugs cannot.
---
Yah of course, really focused on just ST raid boss encounters.
---
While I do still think alliance should have had shaman, and horde should have had paladin from the start, I have to agree.   I mean, I can see why they didn't, because they didn't have races that "fit" at the time.   But it worked out in so many ways because each faction had a unique option to take into group content.   Alliance felt different to horde and vice versa.  Once TBC hit, as you say, there wasn't really a difference between them aside from narrative.
---
Okay, wow.  Fuck that guy lol.
---
Join groups and purposely stagger-kill so you're the only one that gets quest loot
---
Can't mind vision past the closed door to emberseer room. Maybe if you remember names of some mobs in the room above it could work.
---
Find you a market that you want in on, watch it for a few days. Decide if you can corner it, if you can make sure any auction for said market comes from you. Buy out all competitors. Profit. I did this with silk cloth in MoP and a few other expansions on a 37 rogue, forcing silk cloth to be 2g per cloth.
---
Yeah, I always pictured myself being quite happy with my gear setup then the next day trying to login and wondering what was happening.
---
as a warlock I tied rolled on a cloth spell damag chest to a holy paly and lost
---
Dude I completely forgot that gear can increase hit/crit chance. I've been thinking "I do decent damage bc I crit so often, gotta prioritize agility." And that seems to have been working great thus far, but I am starting to get closer to oom than previously. I'll definitely look into your priority suggestion going forward.
---
All spoken word is just a series of grunts if you boil it down
---
Feedback: 
---
Imo your mage PvP guide is very mediocre. 
---
Good:
---
Great introduction
---
Reasonable builds
---
Good explanation of stat priority
---
Nice compact article.
---
Bad:
---
Your mage role in PvP seems very off. The general idea of what a mage needs to do is there, but it's limited and lacking. You only cover the generic kite and control plan but this plan doesn't hold up to all the PvP builds tired. 
---
To improve:
---
Imo the article needs a matchup section. 
---
It doesn't cover how to gain control or hold it. It needs explanations of what to open with on each class and how to do damage. 
---
It doesn't mention down raking in appropriate depth. 
---
Each section should mention how different builds change matchups. IE deep Frost is very reasonable vs rogues. It's a highly technical matchup that favors the more prepared. PoM-Pyro however has a very hard time once the rogue opens but can easily win the matchup through burst damage or if it opens. 
---
It needs a better PvP gear section. It mentions key consumables and trinkets. It sound probably mention gear swapping in fight, Target SP, Crit, HP, and and targets. It should have an example of what gear is easy to obtain (Necro set, crown of the ogre king, blah blah) and long term improvements until P2/3.
---
I know this, but that doesn't change the fact that the base miss rate is 8.41%. his comment also clarified "all races all weapons" which is pure shit.
---
what weapon are you using with the lovely set?
---
And Rage. Okay?  That really necessitated a response a month later?
---
I’ve been enjoying healing in duengons over doing quests. Is it okay to spam dungeons to level? Also I’ve already put a few points into holy and don’t have enough gold to respec to shadow.. should I just go down into holy and then respec to shadow at 40 when I have more gold?
---
Are you saying hole or soul?
---
I did that as a priest back in the day when farming the chest for my rogue. Mind vision your way from purple entrance until you get to the tunnel, reset, repeat.
---
When you say corner it, that makes me apprehensive. I guess I’m scared of tying up my last bits of gold on my main in something that won’t sell.
---
Wait, so they role play pvp in voice chat? Like what you'd do as a child playing cops and robbers?
---
"I just shot you!" 
---
"nuh uh, you missed!"
---
Just run a normal exercise plan that will actually get you fit. Doing pull-ups or pushups during your downtime in wow is great but it's totally unnecessary if you actually compartmentalize your time between wow and fitness. I actually think that you'll enjoy wow and exercising more if you do this.
---
For example, after work I go straight to the gym at 4 and then completely binge on wow for the rest of the evening. I no longer need to really focus on weightlifting anymore because I've been doing it for so long that I'm basically on autopilot, I just make programming adjustments when needed in order to continue progressing. That gives me like 2 solid hours to theorycraft, organize a dungeon run in my guilds discord, catch up with friends via SMS or catch up on other life stuff remotely. I do all of this on my rest time on between sets.
---
Beginning a weight lifting program is very easy. You really only need three things, the proper equipment at a gym, an expertly crafted program and, good healthy food. 
---
Check out Johnny Canditos linear program if your a beginner. You should be able to run this program for atleast a year. Then you can switch to his intermediate program. This guy is 100% natural and competes in powerlifting in the IPF which drug tests reguarally for steroids. His programs were designed for himself and others like him who don't plan on using steroids. 
---
You only need a squat rack, bench, pull up bars and free weights to run these types of programs. Any gym should have them. If you have a real jail house weightlifting club in your area go there as opposed to a regular fitness club. It's like the difference between joining a hardcore raiding guild and some casual shit that gets advertised in trade chat. 
---
Food is easy. Powerlifting is a weight class sport. Theirs no such thing as "bulking". Athletes should just always be eating atleast 500 calories over their total daily expenditure every day to recover properly and build lean muscle mass. Eating is key. Your body can't defy physics and build muscle out of nothing. You have to eat to grow.
---
These programs will have you lifting 4 times a week. 2 upper body days and 2 lower body days. This gives you twice the frequency on the competition lifts as opposed to 5 day "bro splits" (which I may add were originally designed for athletes using steroids and are thus less effective than upper lower splits for natural athletes). Frequency is key for three reasons, one the competition lifts build muscle and create symmetry very effectively. Two, more frequency leads to mastery of the movements which leads to moving more weight. Three, frequency of the competition lifts focuses your total overall volume and makes your programing simple. "Majoring in the minors" is a very common pitfall for many strength athletes. Dude no one gives a shit how much you barbell curl and tricep dip. If those exercises are no longer fixing the weakpoints of your bench then your wasting your time and someone with more focused programming will consistently outlift you.
---

I did a 90-120 recently and it's honestly not bad if you do it right, 90-100 was literally 3 hours.
---
Soak the potion into a sponge. How do you drink a potion with the full, sealed helmets of high end plate gear?
---
What's the best way to preserve all ingame settings and addon settings If I have to temporarily uninstall WoW? If I backup WTF folder, will it be enough to later restore all settings?
---
Are you using potions and Dark Runes? To be honest, Without those mana is going to always be an issue. You really should t be the one healing the tank though.
---
Stop cheating you can't just dodge every bullet I shot you
---
Remember you can use your mailbox as extra storage, just let it sit there until you have space and then return it.
---
What was even worse was when Blizzard implemented paid server transfers in 1.12 and all the guilds stuck on 4h started poaching tanks from other servers.  I've still not forgiven Blizzard for that.
---
A straw

I see a powerful demon. I enslave!

All races if you have 2 points in Weapon Expertise :D
---
Most likely. It’s almost guaranteed to be a pseudo random number (which is a roll that most people agree is ‘close enough’ but not actually random) and the data type is probably a float or there’s some ghost roll that’s now shown. 
---
But that’s how 99.9% of randomness works in games. Getting true random numbers is very very time intensive. 
---
In the first case the roll is most likely (0.01-1] then multiplied by 100 and the cast to an int and printed but the actual roll is what is compared. 
---
The second case is pretty self explanatory. If there’s more than one highest roll every tied player performs rounds of hidden rolls. Every round the ties, if they’re the highest, go on to the next round and the lower rolls get knocked out of the running.
---
Yeah there's a r/mankrik sub with like 500 members...2 posts in the last week.  I'll search discord.
---
*zooms in on the word "seemingly"*
---
Rogues can go up to the door for UBRS and get him too. Don't have to wait on the pat.
---
I think being protection specced while leveling is probably wishful thinking. But at least put a shield and a one hander. Damage mitigation goes from 25-30% to 45%+
---
Now feral druids are amazing tanks when levellnig as they are already "tank specced".
---
wtf
---
We got 2 ret raiders on our guild. So we are missing 3 it seems.
---
He pluralized ore as "ore's."
---
I use Auctionator (there's a fix for it to work with Classic), not Auctioneer.
---
It took maybe 10 minutes of clicking around and reading to explore most of the features. Scan took about 2 minutes. You can set how much you want to undercut by default, see how things price out per unit or per stack, set buy lists, etc.
---
Probably a video or two out about it too.
---
In Soviet Russia, skins mob you :D
---
Pug unfortunately
---
The last few levels really don't take that long.  You have a mount, all flight paths, and access to a wide variety of quests (including many quests for the several max-level dungeons).  You also have all your situational class abilities, so the world is less dangerous.
---
Doing quests and dungeons, the later levels are only marginally longer, time-wise, than early ones.
---
Loot the fucking core hounds
---
We had a warrior join and raid with us for the first time this week.  We've already been raiding for a month and have tanks set.  He was upset he didn't get funneled gear and demanded to be made MT leaving after being told no.  At least he then correctly joined a guild that was still building a roster to raid where he could be MT.
---
To be honest we also have mage who gets upset and whisper's me his outrage when he doesn't get loot.  It's very frustrating.  He got our second mageblade one week and then the next week he's freaking out everytime he doesn't get loot(most of it awful arcanist pieces even).  What's frustrating is that running 5 mans he wouldn't roll need on anything because he "didn't want to look like a loot whore", now it's a complete 180.  Honestly I want to tell him LC just isn't for him but they did give him the mageblade so that kinda sucks to see leave the guild.
---
Rag is definitely a DPS and a consumable check, healers shouldn’t run OOM unless your gearless as a raid.
---
You will be contacted shortly, brother
---
We as 1, will defend the tribes of our peopl
---
hrm. ALliance or horde? part of me wants to go find him and do the same. (I'm horde on westfall)
---
Decursive is what I'd recommend.  It's an addon and you can set a manual dispel priority (usually tanks-healers-DPS).
---
I only killed 4 bosses in naxx and my highest rank was 10.
---
Good idea, I might do this with my buff/portal bar.🙂
---
Had a shaman in my guild that said he had Naxx on farm in vanilla but didn’t know shaman totems only hit the group they were in. Right buddy.
---
Agree, you gotta do healing assignments in a 40 man raid. I just got made my guild's healing officer and not only was the last MC smoother with far less tank deaths but the raid was done much faster.
---
As someone who was adamant 'no druid tanks' (although not very vocal about it) after running a bunch of dungeons with 1.12 patch druids tanking, I am starting to LOVE them. Druid snap threat is insane and they can easily hold multiple mobs.  
---
I am not convinced about raids yet because crushing and no parry, but as a healer druid tanks are a cinch to heal in 5man content.
---
What probably happened was that you left Azshara but didn't zone into Winterspring before dying. The game realizes you're nowhere and ports you to Westfall.
---
Alliance people do the Westfall death port in Barrens using that.
---
I highly recommend watching this video by Kargoz! He and other pserver players did a lot of testing with different class combos for leveling and he has great recommendations of classes that can speed level as a duo:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_rHqqYnh18
---
Hence why I said in a few levels.
---
For sure! I said as much in my original post here:
---
&gt;The budding [Mage PvP Guide](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/classic-mage-pvp-guide) is very much a work in progress and a lot will be added / change until Phase 2 arrives. Need to add PvP race information (although much of it is already on the introduction page), PvP gear recommendations, dueling recommendations, battleground tips, maybe some underhanded Phase 2-specific honor farming tips (camp the flightpaths? XD)...for now I focused on PvP talent builds that were used by popular PvP faces of the past (links to nostalgic videos included!) and some PvP consumables. 
---
If there is any part of the guide that needs a lot of work its the PvP section, got gigantic improvements planned for it, including pretty much everything you said :) make sure to check it out later, can't wait to get all that work in front of you guys!
---
Incoming ban, bucko 
---
For me, timberfall farm was 5g per hour yesterday outside of Grey's and green sales
---
Because things change? Life isn’t black and white? Also, I have no idea why you care.
---
Keyword consistent burst
---
Isn't that basically the only piece of gear they compete with healing priests with?  Not to mention if he does switch to healing he can still use it.
---
How'd you get whispers to go to a separate tab like retail? That an addon?
---
Was someone named AskReddit?  LMAO!
---
I havent tried her on classic but on pservers she was had af compared to the other bosses. 
---
We used to two man for money in full BWL/AQ gear, had runs down to like 8 minutes. I forget why but we tried to kill that boss one time and she lit us the fuck up.
---
It seems weird that they want full regrowth up time.  Its a weaker HoT that rejuv, and the mana efficiency is lower.  Far better, I think, to just use rejuv and spam more downranked healing touches.  How many dedicated healers do you have on the tanks for Rag?
---
does trueshot/surefooted spec suck for farming mobs? how often do you respec? Should I just be BM when its not raiding day?
---
Got it first try as a druid with my guild (and forors dropped also first book we found)
---
Still no healing 1h mace from BRD though after so many tries
---
There is a(5) person who multiboxes 5 warlocks with  all good pvp hear on my server. He kills people almost I stanly with dots and fears
---
Better be careful bucko
---
WoW had like 7 million subscribers during 1.12.  24,000 people isnt even close to 1% of that figure.
---
I just use the built-in raid frames in the game's interface options.  When a curse pops up on someone their grid square gets a little purple star on it.  It ONLY shows me the curses, not the things I can't dispel.  Works out pretty well.
---
Hey that's awesome, bit OT but what is the nature of your thesis?
---
You can surprise alliance warlocks with how many fear resisting and breaking effects you have though.
---
I'd rather steal panties than valor.
---
I had my shield up and I deflected it!
---
That's honestly probably just the batching time between casting it and it applying where the mob has hit you.
---
Funnily enough, I made a tank because I assumed there wouldn't be any wait time, guess I was wrong. I am specced prot with points into holy for consecration, the amount of people who don't know how to wait 5 seconds for paladins to get aggro are too damn high. Then they have the audacity to call you a "shit tank". 
---
It seems like mages and healers are the most saught after SM.
---
It brought so much flavour to the faction it was a good thing to not give both to each side.
---
But later on its good that they gave both to each.
---
I know right? Just downvote if you disagree with someone
---
Id give a nut for that neck
---
I'm on Kromcrush Horde which is also quite big and down for leveling an alt. If you're interested let me know and I'll add your bnet in a few hours (on my phone out right now)
---
I’m assuming you’re a sword rogue since you’re using thrash blade. Go get mirahs song
---
Yep! Utility people! Use it!
---
Incidentally, that brings up another reason for DPS dips. I keep r1 Earth Shock on my bar specifically for interrupts (and because when I'm low on mana, it sometimes triggers clearcasting). That definitely lowers my dps, but keeps us from having to drain all our collective mana and sanity killing the dang mob.
---
Yep. I used to respec every week for raiding/BGs.
---
Eh not worth it to me. This is the most I’ve done with a target in ages
---
PvP Flair you say?
---
Hmmm... Ok here goes:
---
Warlocks are stupidly OP in Phase1
---
Agree with everyone else replying to your comment lol.
---
99% of people who claim they were in naxx pre wrath are lying.
---
I dont doubt this story for a second, such a 16 year old thing to do lmao
---
Farm mountain silversage and plaguebloom.
---
Make mongoose pots.
---
Sell them.
---
Profit.
---
Or take the lazy way out. Buy the MS and PB off the AH, combine, and have a smaller margin. On my server you can buy the mats off the AH for cheaper than the finished product.
---
Make a spreadsheet, check what you can make and how much they sell for. Price check the mats. If you have a decent margin. Profit. (don't forget the AH fee).
---
Further edit. Since you are a tank, finding groups is easy. PUG/Farm scholo with the mana pot recipe reserved. Get it, farm the mats, sell.
---
Why was that a mess up? Seems like a pretty fucking sick arms warrior wep.
---
Ni Hao
---
That or, if they’re kiting, clear mobs in the way for them. As long as you don’t enter the mob’s aggro table it’s fine.
---
Because they're playing 1 account and using a computer program to bot the other accounts into copying the commands.
---
If they were actually playing 5 accounts with 5 sets of inputs it would be ok, but no one can do that because it's not efficient. They use a computer program to automate it, which by definition, is botting.
---
There's a misconception that botting is only when a program runs on it's own perpetually. This is not true. Botting is any sort of computer based automation. The rule is 1 press = 1 action. When multiboxing 1 press = 5 actions.
---
Blizzard is hypocritical in this respect. Most likely because they make 5x the money.
---
How do you position them on rag?
---
Yep pretty sure it is, you can tell by the long ears and purple aura.
---
We have three druids in our main raid and they all do good jobs.  Feral tank for AoE tanking trash, one resto, and even a boomkin.  He does great in dps but is constantly mana starved compared to other classes... poor guy.  (I'm a Warlock main, Life Tap ftw)
---
Not high enough level
---
&gt; Ah the hoops through which paladins go to generate threat.
---
no-taunt-problems
---
I've thought about doing one for pve and one for pvp, but the gear for pvp mostly comes from pve, so that wouldn't work out super well.
---
Just so you know, the medium shot pouch is a recipe from BB AFAIK, not the pouch itself.  You still need a leatherworker to craft it.  Check the AH, but there are sporadic reports on Wowhead of the recipe not being in the vendor's inventory in Classic.
---
I think they should add a lot of the TBC talents and class balances.
---
I love seeing the front page posts this past month about people showing off their 8/8.  9/10 it's a druid and I just roll my eyes.  I think the one exception I saw was a shaman.
---
Liked, subbed. Wtb more:).
---
Yeah man. Between this and the nameplate range nerf it kinda drives me nuts. Feels like flying blind just by your gauges lol. Still love my Priest tho.
---
Yeah that definitely makes sense. We have 3 tanks and then an additional 1-2 depending on fight. I can see it being nice for a QoL aspect
---
I know that. But unless wowhead is missing the recipe the biggest on until the level 30 pouch is 8 slots.
---
Got a freezing band on my mage
---
Sold it and bought myself and all my friends first riding skill. No regrets
---
So, a tiny number of people compared to the millions of WoW subs at the time. 
---
I guess you're saying that people who did Naxx have an insanely high return rate to classic and make up a much larger share of the population now?
---
Yes they do.  You can stand on the ledge right next to Qia and the guards won't aggro you.
---
welcome to independent confirmation of something that previously only had one source.
---
also that was this month.
---
and 1990 called, they want you to stop using their jokes.
---
Just FYI, this screenshot caused me to go on a dumb quest today to find out if HoJ is bugged.
---
After much /combatlogging and testing with various addons we came to the conclusion that Recount is a shit addon that doesn't know what it's talking about. It seems to "guess" the source of your HoJ procs, and also guesses at the resulting swings (since none of this is actually tracked in the combat log). The other dps meter addons don't show HoJ procs for this reason.
---
What ends up happening is that Recount thinks that your regular offhand swings are HoJ procced swings, while it counts the actual HoJ procs (that are mainhand swings) as regular melee attacks.
---
Here's a pic from my testing clearly showing HoJ working correctly:
---
https://i.imgur.com/RBjWQuR.png
---
Here an offhand melee swing (the 56 dmg one) procs a HoJ mainhand attack. I'm using a 2.8 mainhand and just auto-attacking, so you can verify that the timestamps match up.
---
Scrapped the idea, the macro was never the problem. It was the auto-targetting.
---
You can select an option to open whispers in a new tab using the social menu, I believe.
---
Why don’t you tell them you’re a skinner? Also who just kills devilsaurs and can’t skin them?
---
I did 2 SM cath runs last night with 4 paladins. I'm a holy pally, there was a tankadin, 2 ret, and a mage. I was 38, 3 were 36, and one ret was 32. We cleared it twice with no issues, just a bit slow DPS, but that's to be expected at those levels. So many buffs though. And the consecration was blinding.
---
I lose it Everytime he goes into the closet closes the door then comes back out 1 second later.
---
Awesome, thanks. I've just been starting the farm over the past week or so, and the layering changes have made it pretty brutal on my server since it's seemingly always packed. 
---
Those ones have higher drop rates though, right?
---
Well I guess you wouldn't respec then. Sounds like he has the time so he will. Live and let live lmao
---
I saw my first hoj drop after 112 angerforge kills and I lost The roll to The tank. 2 minutes later a krol blade dropped (im a rogue), The whole grp passed bcuz they felt bad for me losing The hoj, never thought id see something like that in wow 2019
---
Where though? There are no quests in 1k needles no more
---
In most of these sentences it’s not correct, period.
---
Here’s what you do: start following him. Don’t mine anything. Don’t kill anything. Don’t talk to him (he ignored you so this is easy). Literally put yourself on /follow. Then ignore him. 
---
Don’t go AFK. He’ll figure out what you’re doing fairly quickly and try to get you stuck somewhere. If he does, just get yourself unstuck and start again.
---
It will drive him nuts and he won’t even be able tell you to stop. It will end one of two ways: he’ll hearth to get away from you or he’ll log out. 
---
Either way you win.
---
[Which vendor trash?](https://imgur.com/5kAakO5)
---
He has some rogue stuff more and a few healing flasks. That's it.
---
Edit: Sorry for shitty image quality. But I guess you can make everything out when you zoom in.
---
[Here is my me checking on my experience table](https://imgur.com/a/l98ar8L). Half was from purely killing mobs your own level is indeed level 44.
---
“. And”
---
That's not how an aggro reset works.
---
Just the worst
---
Is it better to wand or just pump a R1 frost bolt into it in your opinion?
---
You can answer this with math (you can plug in your own numbers):
---
2 respecs/week = 100g/week  
---
Farming = 30g/hr  
---
Level 60 = 180hrs  
---
You will be investing roughly 6K gold in leveling time to save 100g per week, meaning you will break even after around a year. Sounds like a bad idea.
---
1v1 isnt my priority.
---
both classes improved greatly when they didn't have to balance the game around their exclusivity.  shaman not having blood lust in vanilla is a fucking joke
---
It's woefully underrated that he's getting pissy about copper in Dun Morogh.
---
Personally I would love the other way around, more differences. DK to Ally and some other thing to the Horde, Death Shaman or some shit. Make each faction play different like Orcs and Humans in privies Warcraft games. Make ally players hate not having Shamans and. Wise wersa.
---
This aint Tolkien universe, orcs aren't plants!
---
You should roll up a new character named Bucko and follow them around on that
---
*dispels it*
---
This is awesome thanks for the in depth reply. My only question is what is the 24/21 spec? Does that mean fire 24/frost 21? Or fire and arcane. And is PoM ever worth taking?
---
If you know you won't make use of enchanting by hustling it, then sure id drop it. And you want to sell ghost mushrooms to help your income then yeah. 
---
There's nothing inherently worse about tailoring than say bs or lw, all three of them work out to be about the same, they end up just 'being there' except for one or two items out of the super long list of recipes.
---
+1 with randoms means once they get their 1 item: "sorry my mom/gf/made up person is calling me I gotta go".
---
But why?  They're soooo suboptimal?
---
They stand on their own between the tanks and melee dps.
---
It's usually not the class/spec that people have a problem with. It's the person playing. I personally don't like grouping with Rets because you never know what the fuck they are gonna need on. Oh that leather belt that the rogue was hoping for? YOINK! That purple chest that hunter has been farming since he's been able to do BRD? Pally item! 1h that the tank needs? Ret took it for when he might tank. Plate chest with Int and +healing? Sorry healer it's got strength and +spell damage I need that. The Ret on our raid team does fine, people just don't like him because he's a huge douchebag not because he plays Ret. Which honestly, I completely understand why people just assume all Rets are either stupid or huge elitist flamers.
---
According to Shadow Panther use Gut ripper
---
I wish I had sold it, never got that toon leveled, I rerolled horde shortly after
---
bruh
---
I'm talking about some bosses that resets the tanks aggro, dropping tanks to 0 threat. So without a taunt, they need to produce a giant amount of threat, to ever get the aggro back. There are not alot of bosses that does, but enough to make it hard for paladin tanks to be used widely for end game.
---
I like 3.  I just wait an extra second or two before I CoC so that the slow is applied
---
That guy is just stupid. If he knows (let alone owns) this market, he should just buy your "underpriced" item and flip it for a profit.
---
While everyone says it is 44 as far as exp it is probably 40 isn’t terms of time.  You get more exp from mobs and quests as you level though sometimes as you go the stuff is more spread out.
---
Only if you consider every member of the raid to be equal, which they never are. 
---
There's the top healer, who brings consumables and has farmed their entire prebis and then optimized it to work in the conditions of your guild's specific raid comp and performance, and then there's the guy who has greens and whatever blues he happened to pick up while doing obligatory attunement runs.
---
Random rolling an eye of divinity between these two people is not fair.
---
Naxx before TBC, one of 130 or so guilds. But never higher than rank 7 :(
---
You can test it out pretty easily with imp renew or imp rejuv in a raid. I have 4xx+ healing and can never override the HoT of the other druid who has 1 pt in imp rejuv but roughly half my +healing. I believe the talented version of the HoT is essentially treated as a higher rank of the spell by the game.
---
Yikes sounds like you are the weird one
---
Quel Serrar looks cool ,but kinda sucks now that I look at it
---
It would be, if there weren’t trolls
---
I would wait. If your server is still layered see if you can get yourself into a layer where it's up.
---
You definitely want to prioritize + shadow over +spell damage (because you get more points for the same item budget if it's limited to shadow) over +stamina (because it's your health \_and\_ mana pool due to life tap) over int (which is total mana and crit).  Int is less valuable because beyond crit it only has an impact when you're at the end of your mana pool.  Someone with 3000 mana and someone with 2800 mana and everything else equal will perform equivalently until they both use nearly 2800 mana.  Crit doesn't impact damage over time spells, so its impact is also limited for locks.  Keeping that all in mind, you \*still\* want enough int that you're not going out of mana too often, and you want enough stamina that you can lifetap as much as you need without putting yourself in danger.
---
As you get higher level, stat priorities can change a little bit based on your spec.  If you go destruction, int and crit end up being more valuable because of Ruin (additional crit damage for destro spells) and because you'll be relying less on dots for your damage.
---
if your shadow damage wand is equipped, you can actually see the change in damage when you put on a piece of +shadow gear - just look at your character screen at the ranged damage.
---
Sooo outside of the largest revenue stream? Lol
---
I don't remember the exact stat but it was like only 3% of the population killed more than 1 boss in naxx and of that fewer than 50 guilds had done a full clear.
---
Why DK to Ally? The Horde invented DKs.
---
Space bar +W
---
Blizzard is a company yes, 99% of companies rely on money and being able to get the most money would be at the forefront would you not agree?, you take a lot about how multiboxers press 1 button to do 5 actions what would you say if it was 5 people only performing those one actions? Would you like say that is bad? All multiplexing programs do is simulate having 5 people or however many people there is. 
---
Botting is something that will never fail, never stop, do one action forever until an outside force stops it. Like others have said mutliboxers can easily be stopped as others have said by simply killing or hindering the main target who is very easy to identify. Bots cannot be stopped they will run constantly until banned.
---
15 year old games are serious business dude.
---
A wise dwarf once said "You guys can just sit outside in the sun all day tossing the ball around, or you can sit at your computer and do something that matters".
---
This makes a lot of sense. Thanks dude!
---
I won’t
---
Naxx was also in vanilla for a short time
---
4 horsemen was one of the most difficult fights, in an instance full of them.
---
I did spider wing and 2 / 3 construct wing.
---
lol, the previous poster called the OP a crybaby and I'm being elitist for defending him. Nice name calling there. Only experienced players use auction addon. No way everyone should be expected to know the value of the item and then decide greed or need accordingly. That doesn't make sense.
---
Doing 3 bosses in dire maul east, can be done five times an hour for 70+ g/hour depending on RNG. Not really a good suggestion imo since you need decent gear.
---
Damage and healing item more likely. If it were a shadow damage item it would be ridiculous, but unfortunately cloth is sometimes the only option for a class that could theoretically use a different armor class due to itemization. Clothadins are the real classic experience.
---
Look at something selling for 30g. Put in chat WTB (item) for 25g or 20g etc. Resell on AH for market price. Rinse repeat.
---
Sadly, most RL will understand this as "no more than 2 druid in my raid" because most of them are brain dead "feral is bad"
---
It happens. RNGesus is a cruel and fickle god. Some dry spells are gonna happen. They're balanced out by the time when gear rains upon your class.
---
I wouldn't risk the lockout, especially in a group fight setting where any random mage can CS and end the fight. My wand is 1.3 speed so I always use it for clearing grounding
---
Came here to downvote the trolls who would take the other guys side but glad to see we can all agree for once
---
Maybe what I can do instead, is just maintain Rejuv, and stay off of the Regrowth, and just go with healing touches instead. That might be OK. But there is no changing the expectation that Innervate goes to the priest.
---
If the role is adjusted where I heal the raid instead, I don't think I'll be able to keep up with the Resto shamans and their chain heals. We'll see.
---
Correct, whoops. Edited.
---
sounds like you learned how to econ just fine?
---
Yea this is definitely not bannable. If this was bannable then camping a player would be bannable and griefing was banned no one would play
---
Sorry you don't get to redefine botting to scope out multiboxing. Botting is automation and automating 4 characters is botting.
---
How you justify your botting is up to you but it's still objectively botting.
---
Play all 5 characters independently if you don't want to bot. Pretty simple.
---
He obviously doesn't understand economics if he's upset someone bought a cheaper sell than his lol
---
You need to open the settings, go to spells and assign the SPELL &amp; RANK to the click. e.g. Flash Heal(Rank 4)  
---
It has shift/control click modifers. You can change the Out of Range arrow settings and the frames can be set up with Number of groups per column.
---
When someone whispers you, you can right click on their name and "open in another window" the conversation!
---
is there some addon like the vanilla addon [cryolysis](https://i.imgur.com/4zZnTjm.png)? its the only addon i really miss having on my mage.
---
Notify an officer about what? BoE epic is great money, all need money. If you want to have it, buy it. It's standard rule when BoE epic drops all need. That cloth guy did nothing wrong at all.
---
Isn't that the realm name?
---
Blizzard does care, it is a bannable exploit.
---
I think he means dire maul east. You can jump down at the start and skip a good portion of the dungeon. After the last boss is defeated there is a tunnel open up to take you back to the start which has 1-4 thorium veins inside.
---
How many friends together? Our guild had 5 of the first 7 60s on our server by doing melee cleave dungeons only.
---
I feel you.  DPS Warrior here too with 0 MC loot.  I did get the Head of Onyxia a few day ago so it does I am grateful for that.  I also wouldn't mind off tank loot either, I have trouble doing duo DM East because I'm too squishy.
---
I'm aware of how its done now and "nu vanilla," I'm talking about how it actually was back in the past. I don't remember there being a logo or the pop up in the olden days is what I was saying.
---
I should rephrase on the pie chart, I didn't mean they are wrong, but they can be easily misrepresentative of the actual data.
---
Even so by your example of taking the sum of all the experience and cutting it in half you still get partly into 47, not 44.
---
Id love it if you made another PSA in a while when you've spend time on your new server comparatively to your old.
---
This would be a very interesting read.
---
Thanks
---
I tried doing it in Arathi when I was 38-41 (there's some level 38 elementals)  but man it was always overfarmed. The fires sell for 3g a pop on my server tho.
---
Thanks for the clarification
---
Yeah this is just completely incorrect.
---
We've been doing this too, kind of sucks when some stuff leaves with the person but i look at it as sowing seeds for the future. We've also grabbed a couple of guiildless people this way though
---
Looking at specifically that slot:
---
I'd use frozen wrath in raid. T2 for most else. 
---
Specific spell bonus (Ie + Frost) doesn't follow the 3 second rule where generic spell damage does. Frost bolts spell coefficient is around 80. 
---
Meaning + damage from a green is around 20% better than generic spell power. 
---
You generally will need to look at your gears overall stats tough. It might be better to use the T2 helm for SP with Int/Stam and swap out sublime wrist guards for +20 Frost. This would overall recover the loss in generic damage from changing helm and leave you with much more Int. 
---
I'd recommend trying to get over 6k Mana and around 250 SP/10% total crit for raids. 
---
Maxing SP is a great pre raid strat for MC/Ony. With less experienced guilds though fights tend to go long so the extra Mana will let you go longer and do more overall damage which is more important than burst DPS. 
---
For PvP that helm is one of the best atm. 
---
For AOE, solo farm, and dungeon clearing it's top tier as well. 
---
For PvP you want to Max Stam/int as opposed to SP. You also want generic damage as you'll do a lot of damage with scorch and AE.
---
He's just butthurt.
---
This happened to me the other day too. Someone messaged me demanding to know why my auction house item was 60s cheaper than there’s and how I was ruining the economy and blah blah blah. Didn’t know people took WoW economics so seriously.
---
I narrowly escaped them while trying to get into MC last night. They specifically targeted our raid leader and main tank, it was hilarious.
---
Idk 500-600 is solid
---
Bow of Searing Arrow....dropped in Uldaman.  It wasn't on the AH and I didn't know really what to do with it.  I currently have a gun, a Shadowforge Bushmaster.  :/
---
he's just trying to collect tips to have a smooth running pug that clears mc in 1.5 hours instead of a 4 hour slog fest cause of time wasting not cause of difficulty
---
Is this Tipsout's reddit account?
---
Yeah, Bucko.
---
We had to give one to a priest in a pug we hosted because we didn't  establish good enough loot rules, and it's better to look dumb than malicious. 
---
That priest then joined guild, so he will be the last to get the eye.
---
Anyone getting on the demon's aggro list. So healing the hunter or damaging the demon will cause it to despawn.
---
The instance I was talking about happened in original vanilla when they would despawn for 7 hours. I was clearing a kiting path, some dick started the fight knowing what I was doing, so I just arcane shot it. I just said "fuck you" and put him on ignore before he could complain, I was pretty pissed lol.
---
I'm sure you can find a guild that agrees with you and I have one that doesn't.
---
Don’t bring shit players
---
Yeah in a pug setting that's a rip.
---
I main tank and raid lead mc and ony as a bare Druid. Top 5 parses on my server out of all tanks. I’ve tanked with a bare to 4 horseman on lightbringer too. Bares are the best tanks except for a couple fights in the entire expansion
---
I didn’t raid at all in Vanilla and only made it to Mt Hyjal in BC.  I was rank zero PvP.  There ya go.  The truth is out there.
---
Pretty much
---
It was an actual issue
---
(I was the only druid in my raid yesterday and I only ever innervated myself. No favoritism.)
---
Absolutely worth getting from the vendor.  just set your hearth to Winterspring and log in/out from there.  Before long you should get lucky.
---
Blood elf's could narratively join the Allaince, it was Lordaeron that forced Kale to his actions not Stormwind. 
---
Adding Draenei to Hord and Blood Elf to Ally would not bun a bad idea and could easy work for the story. 
---
So the horse and Alliances could continue being different.
---
People standing at the back of the house, not aggroing the guards are not breaking any rules.
---
You're being elitist for calling the information incorrect, when there's addons for knowing those things and plenty of people use them - that makes you uninformed and you try to make it the end of all, hence an elitist noob.
---
Is there an addon you have to download to get tracked? I’ve ran mc and ony a few times and when I search my character name, it appears. But there’s no data, am I just too far away to show up?
---
My guild is currently in the same situation as before your 3rd raid. I hope I have similar luck!
---
Can we talk about how he has 3s right now hahahahahah, but nice that's like 35k gold in herbs
---
&gt; He does great in dps but is constantly mana starved compared to other classes
---
Wanna trigger a boomkin?
---
* Tell him to go melee range and try to proc Clearcasting.
---
* Tell him to farm MCPs so he can switch to Cat DPS when he's OOM.
---
* Ask him why he didn't bring more mana pots.
---
That seems high to me although of course it depends on your server.  The recipe under 10g on mine. If you can catch Qia at an odd time when not many people are on, you might get lucky. It was cheap enough on my server that I figured I'd rather just farm the gold to buy it off the AH (and keep leveling in the meantime).
---
You can 3 man it with just ok gear.
---
Devious. I love it.
---
Nothing, obviously. I believe it was meant to be a demonstration of the mindset adjustment that needs to happen in a lot of people.
---
I’m ret and 55 I’ve had no issues so far and often come second or top dps
---
The only time I use HS is when both BT and WW are on cd and I'm over 30 rage
---
Why would you give it to a priest? 50/50 odds to get eod. Most should have it by end of the year.
---
You pricing your items lower than others to sell them quicker just shows you don’t understand the economy!! 
---
Pshh firesales never work! 
---
It could honestly happen only one time ever ....
---
I as a blacksmith, buy truesilver, gold, and mithril.  I covert it into truesilver rod, inlaid mithril cylinder, and mithril shield spike.  Sells for at least double the mats cost.  Gonna be starting on the weapon chains right away.
---
Whispering some bullshit then immediately ignoring so the other person can't retort is so cowardly
---
Well one one side he is impolite which won't do at all on the other hand why would you ruin the market? Undercutting by 40s is not nothing. I would think he doesn't just sell one of them so if. So .40 by the number of sold items is probably not such a small number. I think it is just good manners to check prices and not just blindly undercut by a probably random amount.
---
How exactly does berserker rage increase rage generation?
---
I'm in a decently hardcore raid guild on a smaller server. I think as a druid it's important to play up your strength, which are HoT's. If you plan on only healing, the spec I decided on is Moonglow/resto with Improved rejuv. As of now 80% of my casts are rejuv with the occasional healing touch if no one is taking damage besides the tank.  You have to learn to trust your paladins/shamans/priests to spot heal people who are taking heavy damage in raids.
---
Just don't be one member of a 4-paladin group who are all 'LF1M tank'.  Also, it's worth noting that pali tanks perform pretty well in Scholo and Strat due to the high percentage of undead.
---
Depends on what you have nearby really. Sometimes people will chip in and order breadsticks and wings for the winners too. it changes a bit from week to week.
---
Imo I thought STV as an alliance was kinda BS when I found out horde have 2 flight paths where we have one.  Many times I flew to duskwood to get to northern part of STV.  Ganked and was ganked. Did some big groups where we just messed up horde for a few hours. My only bad grouping experience comes from there. All in all its a 3 popcorns out of 5 for me. I had more fun in tanaris and that jungle zone to the left of it. 
---
 I made alot of money cause I found these massive clams that had some pearl inside that sold for what felt like big money at the time. I still hit 40 with like 28 gold and spent 4 levels farming before I had enough for a mount.
---
Maybe an hour?  Felt longer than it actually was because fighting in water sucks.
---
Yes, I enjoy my pugs to stop for about 10 minutes every pull because someone died.  I like when they drag on for hours because every just stands at the boss for 20 minutes waiting for loot to go out because the MT is also the ML and no one knows what to do without the leader.
---
Yes, those are the best pugs.
---
thats about all there is to be impressed with... sentence fragments, improper apostrophe usage, tense changing
---
2 rogues can do angerforge but you need at least one engineer and some good gear
---
Weird flex but okay
---
Meanwhile more total xp from rested. 
---
The most under-used strategy for leveling is simply not playing for a while once you reach 55+. You get 3 rested bubbles per day regardless of level, resulting in essentially ~10% of a level of free xp simply for not logging on that day, and at 55+ that ends up being a shitload of xp. Get to 55, take 10 days off to level an alt, come back, get to 57 in a few hours, repeat, after a few weeks suddenly find yourself with 2-3 alts at level 35 able to craft all the stuff your main cant, and your main at 60 with minimal effort.
---
I got from 55 to 60 purely on rested xp and it felt like I barely played at all.
---
Whispering to ask if they have skinning sounds much more polite
---
Not disagreeing, but that's irrelevant since I will only be able to take that talent when I hit 60 as my 51st talent point.
---
It’s pretty straight forward out of the box.   Make sure you use the scan function (should appear as a play button on the top of the main window).  There are a couple posting options that calculate posting price for you.  There is also an option that monitors your in and out to calculate profits for you.
---
I'm not saying I'm entitled to a piece of gear after two runs... simply that I'd be annoyed... and I think rightfully so.
---
Halloween Masks this time of year.
---
TIL people actually use 'bucko' as a threat lmao. Priceless.
---
I will do that, thank you!
---
definitely not
---
&gt;There is a difference between saying "that's not the single most optimal build, don't do it" (what you're suggesting I'm saying) and saying "hey, a few builds are just utter trash compared to other options" (what I'm actually saying).
---
Yes, except that saying Boomkin is utter trash when it most clearly is not is asinine. Ret paladin? Sure. Prot Paladin? Again sure. Spriest to a degree? Debatable. Boomkin? Same as spriest.
---
They have value and are easily viable. You literally have no knowledge on the spec itself yet you are willing to parrot misinformation of them being "utter trash". 
---
&gt;Actually, I think the incongruity is in your argument.
---
You're arguing that if someone trys hard enough they can make a meme spec good. So...in other words, if someone puts in lots of time and effort to gear up just right and get the right buffs, they can make it viable. But...that's what a competitive player does, not a casual.
---
Not once did I say they needed to put an insane amount of time into their spec to make it "just right". The only thing I've said is that they get wbuffs (really just Rallying Cry, which most guilds do). Even then that's only so they can look good when compared to the other classes ALSO getting wbuffs. If no one got the buffs Boomkin would still be fine.
---
Meanwhile you are making some claim that because mage is higher damage boomkin must inherently be trash. You say you use "data" but you've never shown any of it nor demonstrated any math behind it. On the other hand I've shown you how high their single target can be when using one spell (This isn't anecdotal just because I know him, I don't know why you think that makes this anecdotal). The fact remains that if you just press starfire you will do fine even when compared to mages just pressing frostbolt. You really only fall off with AoE, which is definitely a negative, but I wouldn't say that makes them "utter trash".
---
&gt;This is just not true. Show me any real statistics to back up your anecdotal opinion and I'll concede.
---
What an awful argument. You hide behind WCL aggregate parses to deflect, yet when someone shows you a non anomalous parse clearly proving the potential you fallback to "oh that's just anecdotal". 
---
I have demonstrated the specs potential, and it's not with some stupid cheese or anything. It's literally just Ony buff, some consumes, and starfire. 
---
&gt;The only way a boomkin player can be moderately reasonable on dps is to fully gear out and bring consumes and bring buffs...which isn't a casual approach either.
---
The only way anyone can look good on meters is to use consumes when others are also using consumes. If no one is using consumes then Boomkin will look just as good as a mage on single target fights, because *news flash* their single target damage isn't bad (like I've shown you).
---
&gt;So why are you advising casuals to play a spec that requires so much work?
---
Not once did I advise anyone to play the class. I simply said that people try to claim they have knowledge on Boomkin or other meme specs when they don't. You've clearly demonstrated my point; you know nothing of the spec yet you are trying to argue against it. There a number of things you can say about Boomkin's flaws, but you haven't named a single one. In fact, you've only tried to debate one of Boomkin's  few benefits. 
---
&gt;I'm playing a 0/30/21 feral OT/healer, not a dps. I don't want to try to emulate Schedo.
---
And I'm a feral tank. Doesn't really matter what flavor of Druid you are playing, in the grand scheme of things we are the absolute most unneeded class. Speedruns clear in less than an hour so just need Druids to buff the actual raid before they go in. Warriors have many more tools at their disposal than us and only with MCP usage do we see viability in terms of threat. In a perfect world you would not take a Druid at all.
---
It's honestly a little insane that you are trying to put Boomkin down, but don't realize you are playing an equally "meme" level spec. Casuals are not going to be able to perform well on Resto/Feral and especially not on HotW. The easiest spec would actually be Boomkin, as it's just one button. Even Resto has to think about getting sniped, when to roll hots, which spec to use, etc. and all of that just to be considered the least effective healer. 
---
I'm sorry man, but you just really do not understand where Druid sits in the big picture of things. Boomkin is not amazing, but parroting that it's terrible when you have zero experience on it is the definition of spreading misinformation.
---
As you know, as stated earlier I keep an open mind, pragmatic approach - i.e. dealing with facts rather than supposing things based on personal ideology.
---
It definitely seems like multiboxing is less efficient than 5 people playing together, for obvious reasons.  I know how annoying it is to wait for *that one guy* in my quest group to get the drops he needs.  I can't imagine tracking quest items for 5 players.  But I guess its the challenge and not the power that is the motivation - fair play.
---
I'm kind of glad I take such an approach though because I end up smiling when I see multiboxers, instead of reaching for that report button.  It's not my thing for sure, but who am I to tell people that they can't do it themselves!
---
You would think that, but one of the absolute worst loot whores I have had to deal with was a Druid. We geared him 6/8 T1 in 3 weeks and then after the healing shoulders from Domo went to a Paladin, he told us that he wasn't raiding with us unless we guaranteed him certain pieces of loot.  
---
Then when I tried to explain that just because its leather doesn't mean its ONLY for druids, he told me that I should learn how raid loot works. Had to gkick him when he refused to come to the next raid. Shameful really.
---
I mean, I both main tanked *and* raid led in Naxx.
---
^^As ^^a ^^Death ^^Knight.
---
Why should a person that does less dps than the tank get dps gear? Sure we can drag you through MC, but you dont deserve gear if you cant out damage a tank. 
---
Someone who heals and actually contributes deserves dps gear for pvp more than a ret who wants a free carry and prio on ret loot over the holies.
---
Thats the real issue with bringing ret. You fuck over your good holy paladins who also want pvp gear for this greedy lazy meme fuck who refuses to respec.
---
cause the drama and promote an OT do it
---
sounds like a good way to go.
---
What does the engineer do
---
I've seen a few here and there, but nothing over the top.  
---
Edit: Multiboxing, that is.
---
If you don't get a single piece of loot for a whole month while running 10/10+1 each week, there's something really wrong with how your raid handles loot.
---
That or you're 1 of 10+ of the same class.
---
Alliance. It was a level 9 warlock at the time. Probably all I can say.
---
I agree with your sentiment
---
to be fair, I think most of the hunters I played with back in the day would also just autoshoot AFK everything while drinking and downloading porn
---
My level 20 mage will be 60 in a few levels.
---
Quick, we need Bengay!
---
You’re acting like this reputation is a grind, which it isn’t. You literally just buy rune cloth off the auction house and then click the complete quest button
---
Up to a point sure. I'd say doing DM:T solo is the true test when it comes to what a Hunter can do.
---
How much is green whelp armor wort in AH and how likely is it to be bought?
---
I felt kinda bad this week... I was in a pug with a hard 2 item cap per person. I had my 2 items and they wanted to try on Domo some more but I had to go to bed for work the next day :(. I told them what was up but I'm sure everyone though I was dipping out because I couldn't get loot anymore.
---
I'm sorry I'm an old man guys, but I need my 8 hours.
---
Not necessarily.   Sometimes RNG really does bone you that hard.  Can't give mages loot if literally no mage loot drops, or perhaps a more realistic example, you can't give 5 mages each a piece of loot if only 3 pieces of mage loot drops (i dunno why i'm picking on mages, it's just what came to mind).  Context matters, too.  If you're the mage that's gotten 5 pieces of loot already, you're going to be lower priority for the next few drops...and if those next few drops take 5 resets to start dropping in any sort of real numbers....
---
For a sort of, "real" anecdote on this: In my raid guild on private servers, our fury warriors averaged one piece of loot every 6-8 weeks.  Why?  Because we got absolutely showered with rdps/healer/tank loot and just had really, really bad rng on getting fury warrior loot.
---
which realm cannot defend our Leader? Shame xD
---
Clean your garrison Bucko
---
Yet I was #1 healer for 3/10 MC bosses with top 4 finish in rest (except decurse fights)... druids aren’t bad just gear dependent. Once you get a 20+ mp5 from gear and +500 healing things start to get much easier
---
i cant imagine caring a single bit about how much /played you have
---
Can clearcast proc with every tick of blizzard?  If so, that's appealing. I thought I remembered reading that in practice it doesn't scale up with the # of mobs in the pull, but I can't recall where.
---
Westfall is server. If you can find him on that alone then we are all in big trouble.
---
Yeah unfortunately this subreddit ain't the most progressive or inclusive.
---
Our guild Druid farms a fuck ton of crowd pummelers before raids and tops the charts in boss fights. Feels good man.
---
^ someone pricing stuff for like 3-4x the mat costs because they had  no competition and then crying when someone undercuts them by a lot.
---
Honestly, I never paid attention to most raid mechanics, I did the R14 grind, but just followed orders and tried  to be where I was supposed to be and just picked up leftover gear here and there. Never been to Naxx, did some AQ20 though.
---
Might as well go pom+pyro then but you'll want Talisman of Ephemeral Power for that.
---
If not that you'll at least want Cold Snap for double block/nova but without Barrier you'll have to [play like a pvp god](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCksZb3UtcbxNn2RoMYnnCbw).

Gcd is 1.5 seconds. So 5 casts is 7.5 seconds. Unless you’re refreshing a seal, 3 is a low estimate.

Damn, that's good news about their lack of immunity, I had no idea. Thanks for the heads up!
---
Same
---
maybe 3 weeks from R13 to R14 if you were lucky because your competition stopped playing to use the restroom on a tuesday morning at 3am
---
I think undercutting by a tiny increment is the annoying thing to do. If you're going to do that, just price it the same. There's nothing wrong with undercutting by a lot if that's what you want to do.
---
Yeah that's what I meant. I sold a lot of kills doing the Winterpring demon
---
How do you generally break up your healers for assignment?
---
I want to see if there is any difference between students ability to understand novels in different modalities, as in, Im going to compare how well they understand a text by reading it and listening to it by audiobook only. If I have time, I want to expand it to ebooks and how it affect them if they listen AND read at the same time. I do not have time for talking books sadly.. but maybe in the future if I decide to get a phd in literature/didactics. 
---
The research within this field is fairly lacking and I hope to find that my findings will help me improve my teaching in the future with less motivated students, or even integrate audiobooks as a form of suppliment / or homework.
---
Thats cool as fuck
---

ahh brilliant i didnt look at the pictures and wasnt aware of this feature.  thank you

I couldn't agree with you more about the rivalry. If it's over a resource I can understand. I just imagined randomly camping any guild member wherever you see them.
---
It’s not layered, thanks for the advice though.
---
Working! Thank you very much!
---
As if the gold to buy rune cloth requires no grind....
---
Naxx was TBC
---
Lol I'd want to tell him to buy it then if he is so concerned with the in game economy and saving the world.
---
Depends on the context mate.  If you are planning your 40-50 man raid roster to go from MC to AQ or Nax, you are doing your other guildmates a disservice by giving the first epic of aurastone hammer to a shadow priest, or giving staff of dominance to a cat druid, or a mana igniting cord to an elemental shaman or any paladin.  When highly competitive cross class items drops, that is where hybrids really bring down the morale of the raid group and of the players that know they are playing their best, but will never put up the numbers of another player at half speed playing a good class and in raid spec.  
---
So, if you want to look at the end game once a week content, hybrids have many other downsides other than just being low on the meters and raiding with more than one stifles the sort of kind of utility their class brings, that any other more appropriate raid specced player would also bring with way more heals.  
---
If you are looking at other parts of the game like world pvp, bg groups, five or twenty man instances, go ahead and put a hybrid in there because those are all about time commitment.  If you want to have a hybrid specced class it may mean you are going to invest more time into the activity, but all the activities are granting sub optimal rewards, so does it really matter that the hybrids are just viable and not optimal?
---
realistically it doesn't matter right since whoever gets the loot will have to wait for everyone else to get loot. I would imagine that officers would be first since usually they play more and put it to better use one way or another. If you have people who raidlog at the top of the list you are doing your guild a disservice.
---
What server are you on? I'm on Arcanite Reaper which is basically the lowest pop NA server and I don't have any issues
---
Technically, but it's required and a necessary evil for balance. You cannot properly balance that, which is why classes locked by race is okay but not if you can't in theory have all classes available.
---
It's a small price to pay for balance.  Although IMHO dwarves should have gotten shaman then instead of Draenei. It fit better due to the Wildhammer Clan. Blood Elf Paladins make some sense.
---
Find yourself a tank. Instant instance groups. People pay tanks in my server all the time. Looking to hire tank for xx. 5g/hr type thing
---
Oh nah I don't camp after killing them randomly. I don't have time for that nonsense
---
Grenade the adds around angerforge right after the other rogue opens, just helps reduce incoming damage a bit before they get blade flurried down
---
We tried forming a snake. Where I was following the guy at the end. We just al stopped
---
Sure but if Classic+ becomes a thing there may be a new raid that opens up that is an axe that doesn't give weapon skill so likely Orc would get back on top.  Or they completely re-do the +weapon system in a Classic+ world.
---
Those dots are going to tick regardless, overhealing me if I'm topped off. Why not take advantage of those self heals trickling in? Convert health to mana so blue bar &gt; green bar, then keep casting and keep going.
---
It resets aggro fine, it's just when they are both running at my pet and I shoot Cho, Gordok will sometimes turn around and go after me as well. He shouldn't do that. Recently he hasn't been doing that in the last 2 days so maybe it comes down to luck.
---
Getting flashbacks of TBC when they thought  meeling in boomkin to get Mana was the solution.
---
Lol some people
---
currently leveling a rogue, just got both wingblade and stinging viper
---
should i use both? i'm forced to have the mace in the offhand since wingblade is a mainhand wep, but should i avoid doing this? should i have the mace as my mh and find a decent offhand? my only offhand atm does half the damage of wingblade
---
According current classic players, literally everything is against ToS. Pvp? Against ToS. Reserving items? Against ToS. Rolling on gear outside your current spec? Against ToS. Creating a gnome? Against ToS.
---
Exactly how they wrote. I did not use any addon for that.😄
---
Literally first time Reddit poster here lol, I shall see where my old and technology challenged self gets me.

Cheers and a link would be epic if possible my snarky friend

If you look around, people create macros just to spam Qia and quickly buy whatever limited item recipe she happens to have on her. That was too much for me. But it's an option. I'd rather play the game than camp a vendor, personally.

Just like Leroy Jenkins. Pretty much everyone knows it's fake but we all still laugh.

---
That's why you reset it for Ragnaros so that everyone can roll. Most likely they are missing a BiS off Ragnaros.
---
Why does it suck?
---
Copper isn't that rare now that the majority of the players have moved on to Iron and Mithril and above.
---
I was thinking the same, but wanted to equip a cool new bow haha. Thanks for the reassurance, I'll probably sell then.
---
Best thing I learned in wow econ was to make your numbers stick out. I'll gladly undercut by slightly more if it means I can put something up on auction for 4.20.69 or something like 22.33.44. 
---
People really seem to notice numbers like those and my shit always sells.
---
When people blank out the names I always assume fake.
---
I still remember how sore my eyes felt from that damn grind. You'll never take away the rewarding moment of showing up to an AQ clear as a rogue with 2x r14 healing maces with +healing on both. Not getting heals for the first half of that raid was well worth it! We only downed 4 horsemen sadly and no full clear. Also if anyone talks a big game trying to live off past accomplishments AND they still die to known mechanics repeatedly, please mock them.
---
As someone mentioned as a comment to my post here, it seems all you have to do is get behind them and all the alts become dead-weight.
---
ASBESTOS FREE
---
That was pretty fun to see last night.
---
Earlier when your back was turned I changed the sites on your gun to shoot to right. and emptied out all the bullets
---
So you couldn't have shot me.
---
I feel like I've gotten an aimed shot in here and there but it isn't consistent enough for me.
---
You sound petty and selfish try reading the question again
---
does that work since it's party only or do you get the threat for everyone in range
---
also is spamming demo good on raid bosses? shouldn't sunder just be better for one dude
---
I was r14 but clearing MC one time was my only accomplishment in pve :\^) 
---
Unless you count the time I logged onto my friends priest to kill nefarion because she had something come up so she had to leave and she really wanted a drop from him. Kinda surprised that I didn't fuck that up somehow but I doubt I was much help in the fight. Kinda funny to be able to say that I've killed nef but never even killed razorgore tho.
---
I killed a few bosses in Naxx40, guild quit to take a break when TBC was announced like many did.  I think I got the full blue pvp set on my mage during the real pvp season, about as hard as I pvp'd.  Switched to my shaman at the end of vanilla to grind out the easy Warlord gear and Unstoppable Force.
---
I did raids with a group of guys on Stonemaul-US that ended up making A-team who cleared Naxx40.  One of their mages I knew was able to get Atiesh.  I had to leave the server bc I was a general douche back then unfortunately.
---
Probably best to mix for Frost/fire builds. Pom pyro and elemental I'm not sure. Pom probably just wants to Max SP while elemental probably wants more Mana. 
---
I believe you can get very close to 4.2k HP and 6k Mana mixing while still having a reasonable SP bonus around 250. But I'm not sure.
---
I just don’t have it in me to not heal
---
Crazy schedule you got. 8-10 is the only time I get to play.  Twice now I was able to log in the morning and what a difference.
---
I prefer /roll for crazy moment shananagins. But we are switching to dkp with a monthly decay. The addon we are using is cool. Its alot of automation and tracking loot.
---
An old person.
---
I'll have to check this one out, thanks.
---
I’m gonna go ahead and assume you’re a bitter virgin, so your opinion is worthless
---
I rolled a human warrior in Vanilla and paid money to race change to gnome in WOTLK
---
Gnomes have amazing racial, and you know what else? They have cool animations for melee and playing a gnome warrior is so BM, people are just always triggered that a 2’ tall Loli is killing you.  It’s beautiful.
---
Nothing’s better than playing a gnome warrior and killing some sweaty orc or Tauren, you’re so small and you just SMITE the hell out of them, it’s awesome.
---
Yeah I've met a few officers of the pricing police too. One guy even berates me on a regular basis, I just put yet another toon on ignore and carry on. 
---
Funnily enough on the Horde side i get none of that at all. It's the gnomes I tell you. The dirty little gnomes!
---
If it's truly worth as much as he thinks it is, he would buyout your wares and repost them with his pricing. He wasn't willing to put his money where his mouth is!
---
Do faction leaders drop loot or is it just purely for dominance? I’ve always wondered this
---
Agreed, ive put well over 100 hours trying all the different BRD farms as a solo rogue and 30g/hr is real-world average.
---
DOTs will still work if they are behind you.ce
---
with the 2 melee hunters as well right?
---
Yeah I was aiming for close to the same total mana cost without going over. 4 casts would be 600 mana but again would still be a huge amount more threat.
---
The break-even point for threat seems to be between 2 and 3 class members at 3 casts per 8 seconds:
---
2 class members * 114 threat per * 3 casts = 684 threat for 450 mana.
---
**VS consecrate**: 730 threat for 565 mana in those same 8 seconds.
---
**VS 4 casts on 2 class members**: 912 threat for 600 mana
---
**VS 3 casts on 3 class members**: 1026 threat for 450 mana
---
So you can extend it to say that 3 class members = GBOK is superior threat for the mana. Anything more than that and GBOK is **vastly** superior threat for the mana.
---
Or you can extend it to say that provided you have at least 2 people to hit, you can greatly out-do consecrate for threat per second, at a slightly increased mana cost.
---
Or you can just go-for-broke and do both!
---
not true... at least not true on my realm. I played on a high population realm, and you needed 30+ hours each week to get and maintain rank 10 and at least 5/10 additional hours for rank 11/12. Rank 13/14 were controlled by the top two PvP guilds that basically played almost nonstop. When BG were introduced, you simply couldn't finish in the first 70-80 people on your side to even hope for rank 13 without tremendous efforts.
---
You need to fire this officer and replace the position with someone that understands the paladin class and each specialization in the spot.  All of the officers in my guild understand their class to a T and are constantly theory crafting about different things and informing new guild mates about little things they may not know or cool macros they use in grinding or raids.  
---
Having an officer not even know about plate gear being not viable for DPSING in raids is not acceptable for someone in their rank.  They could perhaps hand out loot in a raid where the other class officer is not present, but they should not be the one representing your guild when another paladin comes to look for a spot and query if your guild is the right one to raid with if you are looking to keep the few recruits you are receiving.
---
&gt; Getting flashbacks of TBC when they thought meeling in boomkin to get Mana was the solution.
---
I'm pretty sure that I read somewhere that that was the original design. (It makes sense given the armor bonus, Omen of Clarity, increase to physical damage in Balance, etc) i.e. Boomkins were originally supposed to melee for more than just Clearcasting procs.
---
Speaking of BC, if they ever do BC Classic I'm rolling a panzerkin again. Tanking as Boomkin was hilarious and fun. I only ever did it with my PvP gear for resilience and never went full on to gear it out properly.
---

Yeah I always found it weird that clearcasting doesn't proc on spells. That would help boomies so much in classic.
---
Why not? It can be fun and makes unique experiences.

IIRC the hit cap is implemented weirdly and you actually need 1 more percent than you'd think from the straightforward numbers, just an FYI.
---
Then what is the best way of farming masterful one?
---
I don’t think he means you. I think he’s just saying don’t micromanage your raid. I was watching a twitch feed of some raid leader during MC pulling reports and all sorts of stats and calling out people for not dispelling enough and things like that. Let people have fun, etc.

---
Healbot should be able to track buffs and durations.
---
Why did you give him six pieces? I don’t care if he is the best druid on the server. You always rotate gear as insurance against asshat loot whores and people who burn out.  Good thing the shoulders didn’t walk out of the guild too to this asshat.
---
Yeah, this. Just cheetah and concussive shot him around the AQ gate ruins and watch out for his bugs. That is much easier than doing the wingclip stuff, since he only does his shadow damage and fear when he is wingclipped.
---
that one is 12 slot.
---
Farm essences of all types, if that doesn't work find decent mob trash and vendor that shit.
---
Wait if you had a +1 system how did this guy have 3 tier pieces before everyone else?? How does that even make sense??
---
Yeah true, and he's been in the limelight long enough that now I feel it's also being used by people who snark on JP - but this guy probably has a super clean room
---
Or you will get a lot of gear they already have for 5 dkp while effectively saving up points. Since they are already raiding and looting while you level.
---
I'm also a Tauren but I get a facial once every two weeks.
---
IDK why you were downvoted... This got a laugh out of me lol
---
I believe warcraft logs has its own program that runs and retrieves your combat log data from your wow folder. As far as I know its not an addon.
---
If you undercut by 40s you are the problem.
---
I think it's a fair question to ask. You can "automate stuff" like stances or menu interactions.
---
Yes, exactly like that.  "You miss, I crit, you shit your pants, gg"
---
I don't even multibox but even I can recognize that they aren't botting.   Botting is where action is decided by the computer.  Since every action is decided by a person and their keypress, how is that botting?  It doesn't even break the rules.  As someone who merely understands how it works, I fail to see how this can be defined as botting.  As I told people in my comment post, I take a pragmatic approach rather than being governed by my emotion on the matter.
---
I undercut everyone on ah just to sell my item. I dont want to have to keep relisting my items as i lose more money that way.
---
Got 7 hours of sleep during the 8 days, without logging out.

Boomkin, you have to include any damage other players cause with the aura.  Ret sanc aura is only affecting pallys really.
---
As a level 57 tank warrior (Prot specced) can I already start doing scholo? I have a lot of decent equipment as I spammed BRD from 55 to 57.  But I don’t wanna keep doing it, as I already got good items (HoJ and tank items).
---
Anyway, can I start doing the high lvl dungeons already? Cause I don’t wanna grind Prot spec.
---
Raiding as a fury warrior is way worse. I've been raiding 3 weeks now and have 0 loot to show for it and have only been really been able to roll on 7 items in 3 weeks, Lost Onyxias head on roll 4 times, Flameguard gauntlets, accuria ring, and BRE with a 95 to a 99 (hurt the worst). In Molten Core and Onyxia combined there are like 7 items total I can even roll on for upgrades to my fury set.
---
We also raid with like 6 dps warriors I think. Rolling for loot is the fuckin worst.
---
Exactly, +1 with randoms is such a shit system.
---
This is for PVP lol
---
have you done cloth turn ins for your 45k exp yet
---
I’m very familiar with those addons. Doesn’t make those a practical solution unless it’s decided before the dungeon that everyone checks the value before deciding need or greed. No one does this.  If one guy doesn’t have the addon and greeds while everyone else needs, then he’s screwed.
---
I'm going with the .99 method and it fucking works. I don't know why but this shit works. Put something for 5g? NO. put it for 4.99? SURE
---
Fair enough. Seems odd, but bugs be bugs!
---
Lololol. That's what you get for no lifing the game. Get some exercise
---
&gt; Yeah I always found it weird that clearcasting doesn't proc on spells. That would help boomies so much in classic.
---
The Wrath era version was the best IMO:
---
&gt; Wrath of the Lich King Patch 3.0.2 (2008-10-14): Now a passive spell. Now also procs on damage and healing spells, yet no longer procs on feral abilities(only auto-attacks proc it). Proc rate is roughly 6% with a 10 second internal cooldown.
---
&gt;Grind out shitty vanilla dungeons without LFG to get pre-raid BiS?
---
... Why are you even playing then? I love the dungeons end game, they all have so much character. And yes, without LFG... it's an *MMO*RPG. Talk to people.
---
I love how nerd is a potent insult between wowers.
---
I just melt in my chair and become one. Sleep is for the week.
---
Pattern drops non stop. Just kill 1 more and it will drop again. I bet it's a out 40s on the AH.
---
I don't know.  They'd do this while we were all in one place waiting for bg queues.  :)
---
Never!
---
*squint*
---
But they don't tho? They scale roughly the same tho?
---
Like, fireball, a spell they can't use until ZG/AQ 20, by the way, has a base damage of 540 to 760. Which is a huge God damn range.
---
And their frost bolts have a base damage lower than shadow bolt.
---
So all things being equal (eg, int and SP), a warlock is more likely to be way more consistent, do just as much, if not more damage, and has been collecting +shadow and +sp gear the whole time. And won't need to change their entire God damn gear set on a per raid basis.
---
Never mind that there's much better mage specific loot when they do have higher damage potentials that you can just hand them when you get there.
---
They're talking right out of their asses.
---
What? No you dont.
---
210k xp needed to hit 60. 210 cut in half is 105k. The chart shows 106k need to hit lvl 44. That's  halfway to 60.
---
I find my lack of boar killing disturbing.
---
That's such an arbitrary awful system. It's easier to LC and decide to roll then it is to roll and then arbitrarily decide hey we should LC this one.
---
Depends on the server, but short answer is yes there are tons of people playing and plenty of end game
---
Full transparency, I raided from MC to Naxx and had a few top three NA kills in that damn zone too. 
---
When I came back to classic, I’m not joking when I say I hardly remembered what stats were important or how blacksmithing increases mining points etc. I literally remembered nothing. Some folks memories are better than others. 
---
It’s all like riding a bike, but knowledge fades over time. Take it with a grain of salt when someone tells you how leet they were, but do not discredit everyone for their past achievements due to their lack of prior knowledge.
---
Ha ha np!
---
It was given to the tank, look at the trade window.
---
Jesus christ you people really either A: were actually bad back then.  Or B: are clueless now.  
---
SHIT WAS WAY DIFFERENT THEN.  It has nothing to do with "a little knowledge."  like fucking lol mate.  Some of you guys act like you invented math or something.  Like you're god-tier strategists.  "Oh just kill him before he submerges!"
---
Did you raid back then?  Because if ya did, you'd know that spell damage gear didn't even exist then.  Did you know that?  
---
You know the Banthok Sash, ya know, that belt that's pretty much BIS for mages and warlocks?   Yeah, this is what it was back then: https://itemization.info/item/11662
---
Fucking 10 stam and 12 int.   
---
A little knowledge makes this stuff trivial!  Lol!  
---
No, ya goob.  The item and talent updates that came at the end of vanilla makes it trivial.
---
Theorycrafters knew what items were best in slot back then just like you do now.  The gear was worse, the bosses weren't nerfed yet and shit was hard. People were good players.  You might not have been, but plenty of us were.
---
My DPS would be higher if my RL would let me run Sanctity Aura!
---
We have a channel in our guild discord #eaten. Where we eat guildies then tag them.
---
Touché stupid auto correct
---
Fair enough lol
---
Everywhere is short of tanks. If you are not a tank, you will have issues finding groups quickly and reliably.
---
Make friends. Put people on your friends list. Say hello to them. Help them.
---
How big the population is depends on what server you are on, and what faction, and in what timezone.
---
Subjectively rather.  Because your emotion rules your response, which ignores which of Blizzard's rules are or are not being broken.  15 years on and there is not a single case where it has been proven that Blizzard's rules have been broken.  It's their game, not yours.

Thunderclap is not a good idea for threat, ever. The only threat it deals is off the damage done, and the damage on it is pitiful. Whirlwinding, even with a 1 hander, would be better threat. And charging in with your 2hander to initiate the pull with a whirlwind is a great way to establish aggro right away.
---
Taking less damage means taking less rage, which is the bottleneck to holding threat in 5 mans.
---
Not even close. Warrior tanks can output 400 dps without issue in MC. Just the DPS alone with the defensive stance multiplier is almost 600 threat per second before you add in sunders and other threat modified abilities like heroic strike. 
---
Paladins still don't have taunt. 
---
Paladin tanks are not going to be the best phase 1 option. This helps you guys out but lets not get carried away here.
---
" Am I wrong or are these not better for raw damage output? I don't know what's more valuable, 18 AP, or 0.6% extra crit. I really like crit personally but if it's at the cost of DPS, nah. "
---
But you will skip battlechaser's, which is at the cost of DPS, because somehow in your head hit% is so important.
---
IDK man, you only need 9% hit at 300 weapon skill or 6% at 305.  Youre gimping your dps by skipping battlechasers anyways.
---
But generally speaking, 30 AP is roughly 1 crit. But if you hit crit cap, the value of crit goes down. So 18 AP and 0.6 crit are roughly equal before crit cap.  But bloodmail have stamina as wellm, making them better. Also, you WILL hit crit cap if you use world buffs, so its more like 24 AP = 1 crit. However, if you are alliance you need to factor kings into your equation, which makes bloodmail/battlechaser even better.
---
14/14 str/agi of the tiger green boots are actually better than all the boots you listed, as long as you have other more efficient hit% pieces.
---
Furthermore, black dragonscale set is EVEN better than that if you wear shoulders, boots, and legs.
---
Whirlwind axe
---
Some guilds are doing a weird raid schedule to counter respec costs. So if you raid for instance Wednesday and monday, you clear mc on monday and wednesday and then dont clear the next week at all. That means ppl that respec for farming or pvp have 11 days to use their spec before going back to pve talents and you still are maximizing raid ids.
---
HRNG its not a "second" ghost roll.
---
The game is actually rolling a float that goes out several decimal places and then only printing the numbers that aren't after the decimal point.
---
Eg: 
---
A rolls 100
---
B rolls 100
---
To the server actually looks like:
---
A rolls 100.48282929
---
B rolls 100.69392829
---
I need to ask him for an uncropped pic
---
While I kind of agree, no one should be told how to play a video game.
---
Where on earth do you find these people?
---
I’ve noticed the opposite. Aren’t rolls in order of who clicked first. Every time I’ve seen a tie and every picture of a tie, the person who rolled last always gets the item.

---
Well first I looked at last week's warcraftlogs parses. It totally depends on the boss, but in general when assigning people to the tanks at least, I pair the better and more geared healers with the lesser geared healers. I put myself and another shaman spamming chains off the tank thats currently on the kill target to keep the melee up, then another shaman chaining the raid with a priest keeping renew rolling on tanks while spot healing raid. For Luci/Baron you assign 2-3 priests to ONLY dispel designated groups. Obviously some fights require more MT heals and less raid heals and vice versa, just move a healer or 2 between those jobs.
---
If you use this trick you get enough rage for most of your mainhands to be heroic strikes, and thus not miss.
---
The matter of fact is, this trick is so strong that hit loses most of its value meaning its not worth going above 6% unless if well there's no better alternative.
---
Say this. You are able to use heroic strike on 80% of your mainhand attacks. This means 80% of your mainhand attacks are guarenteed to hit(well guarenteed to not miss, can still dodge). 20% of them will have a 24% miss chance. If you gain 1% hit above the yellow cap, that means 1% extra of the 20% of your autos will hit. That means your mainhand has on average gained 0.2% hit. That's a very very small dps increase.
---
How does your hit rating look? If you’re not capped I’d say devilsaur for sure
---
I just never understood why Undead couldn’t be Paladins. They can be Priests and use Holy magic, so there’s a narrative. It would make sense that some Human Paladins died and the ones that weren’t converted into Death Knights would be Forsaken, so there’s another narrative. Undead still fight the Scourge and that’s the focus of Paladins so that works too. It just makes sense to me that there should be Undead Paladins.
---
And Dwarves/Night Elves have plenty of narrative that would allow Shamanism to make sense for either race.
---
Depends on what the price was no? If the item isn't in a good place and things aren't moving and you want to make a good sell you put it up for 10-30% off depending on the item. Economics is a social science. People like good deals and they sell quick.
---
You can buy Major Mana Potion recipe from the ghost blacksmith once you're far enough along on the Frostwhisper quest chain
---
You use blizzard
---
i saw another mage advertising the new lvl 55 water as "BiS water"
---
Lets people be good and continue being.. you. Don’t gotta make a post about people who did naxx before
---
Or if you've been a Healer for 2 months, Benediction finally drops and you roll it off to the random Priest that just joined 2 days ago. Fucking awful system designed to cater to casuals.
---
yeah it is
---
In full epic after 2 runs.
---
Normally I have a lack of humor, but I laughed out loud at that last comment.
---
Have the HotW druids on healing touch duty, have a moonglow build druid on HoT duty for the 19% reduced mana cost HoTs, and a Swiftmend druid because why not?
---
2 of 40 seem to have a vague memory which could been no memory at all.
---
Yeah, that's elvui I'm using.
---
My horde brethrens are fucking cowards. I never disturb a 1vs1. Glad some died
---
Lol yea had to turn down terrain graphics for this
---
The number of people who don't jump directly into MC from the upper ring of BRM just proves how many people raided in vanilla.
---
INB4 gatekeeping!
---
Dude these are fury/prot warriors duelwield tanking in full threat gear.
---
I raided naxx constantly in wotlk and have little memories of it. I raided Kara all the time in TBC and probably couldn’t give any decent instructions.
---
It’s very suspicious to me when people are like oh yeah I haven’t done this in 15 years *gives exact instructions on each fight, where to go in the dungeon, things to look at for* 
---
Maybe people just have better memory than us.
---
I'd like to see these posts in the classic+ sub instead of here.
---
Plus at 58 you're basically 60 since you're doing the dungeon farming you'd do at 60 anyway
---
Should have left Snowflake's name in the picture.
---
How did he get the gold? Sitting in org? No... from grinding. 
---
Unless you are me and gamble gold with guildies and literally rake in 500g a raid
---
don't worry, it doesn't get any better at 60 if you go for bis
---
its a mix of leather, mail and plate gear, so nothing matches and everything is out of place!
---
i'm rolling a pally for T2 as my alt this time around BiS in looks and BiS in being useless to any of the 3 roles, maybe i'll finish the set when wrath classic is released.
---
https://i.imgur.com/tkxdnSC.gif
---
Could someone explain what's going on here?
---
People had every fucking clue about itemization.  
---
You have no clue.  Items underwent a MAJOR overhaul after MC had already been cleared.  Spell damage didn't exist.
---
maybe in a pug but not for a guild
---
You forgot the part that clearly mentions in your post "without user intervention",   User intervention is somebody sat there pressing a key.
---
Move along kid.  You dont even understand what you're talking about.
---
Okey, and gold magically appeared?
---
That's because madness consumed you.
---
I assume you are a human warrior in this case? Then go devilsaur.
---
Nihilium
---
DmE with herb is easy and good.
---
the archivist cape would be cool, the amount of time to farm that would be insane, ive seen it drop once and it was intellect. The 1% hit neck would be alright for some fights, but is it worth the 20 shadow damge
---
They are never BiS.
---
Rogue is one of better farmers, think of the healers and tanks.
---
...and not die!
---
They are literally never BiS. What are you saying phase 3 for?
---
Cruising at a cool 53 after playing my char since launch
---
I had a bis'ed warrior tank whisper me when I was in ubrs saying "didn't know ret could beat out rogues"
---
Turns out with better gear and play you can still compete. And funny thing is if I hadn't switched to prot to run dungeons with mages I would have never gotten the gear I did. I got unforgiven and demonshear in one run of strat because my group was all mages and a priest lmao.
---
Edit: and bloodmail boots, and cape of baron, and deathbone chest.
---
OP is levelling his paladin and this is how most of the classes level, each class only has 1 or 2 damaging abilities they use whilst levelling and I was just pointing that out for OP. There are other things like utility and mobility, but these are just the normal abilities people are using whilst levelling.
---
Does it work if the target already has the blessing?
---
You can stand to her side and still be "behind" her with plenty of room to be clear of tail swipes.  In fact, every melee dps should do this to eliminate blocks and parries
---
this person completely cant understand what a ret paladin playing pvp is, this is the level of discussion @ this subreddit
---
In our last Molten Core raid, my guild's ret paladin, who is in pre-raid BiS with T2 helm and a couple of MC pieces did 291 DPS. The lowest DPS was a mage in significantly worse gear who did 242 DPS. The highest was a rogue who did 648. The MT was pulling 320.
---
Eye of Sulfuras dropped that night so next week he will be using Hand of Rag. With a legendary weapon that took insane luck and thousands of gold worth of mats, we are hopeful that he will get up to half the DPS of the rogues and warriors.
---
No, it will improve your white hits very,very marginally if you are playing correctly and cancelling heroics.
---
Got tsm set up, i just spam press the post button, I dont personally put much effort into it. Before tsm, aka before my alt on classic I just vendored everything because putting stuff on ah with the normal ui is way to much effort for me to bother.
---
Blizzard never said it's not botting. They just said they don't punish for it. That's a huge distinction.
---
That's why blizzard is hypocritical. They do ban botters, even when it's one character, but they won't ban a multi accounter who uses a bot to automate their subsequent characters.
---
Multi accounting IS botting. Blizzard just doesn't care, again because of money.
---
Thankfully the definition of English words doesn't matter what Blizzard thinks.
---
Plenty of guilds on private servers managed to have naxx on farm and I'm assuming that's what's they're referring to
---
&gt;Ret paladins are doing more dps than holy paladins in a raid.
---
Joke comment or nah?
---
and it only took you 20 days ! Like i get that its nice strategy and I will use it for my alts, but i rather hit from 55 to 60 in few days then 2/3 of month. Leveling from 52 + seems much faster for me. Im warrior and yesterday hited from 53 to 55 today played few h hited 56. I always log out in Inn. but just waiting 20 days to get few more levels for me just feels silly. esp since you are so damn close to 60.
---
When selling 100-500 of trade goods 40sc is quite much. And a dick move
---
arcane explosion does a lot more damage than blizz tho. blizz ticks for 98 whereas AE does 150ish per hit. i’m wondering what the highest dps is
---
Thank you so much, gonna keep this tab open for awhile !
---
Everyone crying for reports lol, just make a group and kill them
---
Sounds intriguing, tell me more
---
Absolutely. All my Tauren are on WrA, and all my Worgens are on Moonguard.
---
Depends on your leveling habits and efficiency. If you are brand new to classic it could take months if you dont know what to do and arent using a mod like questie to help you. If you are a seasoned player about a week per 60.
---
True. But also no one is entitled to raid groups or loot.
---
In my opinion, yeah, it's super elitist to recommend someone to quit their character for a better one just because their end game dps isn't exactly up to par.
---
Do you think elitism can't happen if the person is telling the truth or "the data supports them"? Because that's generally EXACTLY when elitism happens.
---
If you do it more than once, it's griefing and will get you a neat little ban.
---
Don't.
---
&gt;100.69
---
No, its alot more of your auto damage than 1/3 when you actually do HS queue.  
---
Hit past cap is very, very low value. With full world buffs, you dont cancel HS very often. Hit% only affects your white main hand hits aka your cancelled heroics. Its just very very marginal compared to 1% crit or some AP.
---
Up to rank 11 could be done pretty casually tbh. After that point it could take a long time to get r14 if your server's honor raids were ultra competitive and didn't cooperate with one another.
---
On my server, getting r14 was less of a time investment (although it was still a big time investment compared to most things) and more of a "political" thing. If you made the right connections and were willing to put in the time you could get r14 fairly easy since everyone worked with each other to take turns. We basically just farmed enough honor to set us above everyone that wasn't a serious pvper on the server and assigned "honor caps" to players, which basically meant whoever was next for r14 grinded, say, 500k honor, whoever was up for r14 after that person grinded 490k honor, and so on down the line.
---
I was in high school on summer break when I pushed the last couple ranks and on my last week of honor farming for r14, I had already hit my honor cap by Sunday morning and didn't even pvp for the rest of Sunday or Monday and still got my rank lol.
---
3 different "rotations":
---
A) Low dps high mana effiency: Nova followed up by 2 full blizzards.
---
B) Medium dps medium mana effiency: Cone of Cold and kite with arcane explosion.
---
C) High burst low mana effiency: Nova into flamestrike Cone of Cold on same batch with shatter
---
You will just learn to get used to which to use when.
---
I honestly think that there is truth to both sides.
---
but if your goal is to see and finish naxx on week 1, having a ret there don't help.
---
but how many people have that goal and will stick with it until then?
---
Depends what you're leveling for. My focus will be PvP which isn't really a thing yet, so I didn't care about the delay.
---
If that's the case, he found a lot of it
---
the rep turn in for cloth (60 of each starting at wool) for each of the factions gives a lot of exp
---
it's basically the only time you can have money=exp
---
warning tho, the runecloth is the only high exp one and you have to do the others first
---
You can start healing BRD at 52. There's a few items (shoulders, shoes, pants) that you can get as a 52 healer. You probably cant do a full run to emperor though for those drops unless you are getting carried by some 60s.
---
And how do you plan on holding agro and not getting one shot when you dont dodge an attack?
---
I feel like I keep repeating myself what is with all the ignore happy people on classic? I’ve never seen this many happen
---
Yeah thats true but Im honestly fine with the look of either
---
Till the light dies in your eyes!
---
I mean free games like dota have over 30 million unique hits a yr but only 500k a day. Thats a massive difference, now subtract all the people that actually try to do it competively. Sub number doesnt indicate the amount of ppl who actively played. I think half my high school subbed to wow but single digit numbers had a level 60. 
---
Anyone who put in 40+hrs a week could have cleared lots of nax content. We say now how easy vanilla is to retail, I never played retail - but if that's true then why is it hard to believe the people who are the right age and had the time could have done it?
---
Not only do we do double damage, the bosses themselves were nerfed many times over the course of vanilla.  People wanna act like they're so good or so smart in classic when this is literally the LFR version of the actual vanilla raids.  Enjoy it for what it is and have fun, I am, but they need to stop acting like they're so much better than actual vanilla players were when they have a thousand advantages that they seemingly don't even understand.
---
A lot of time I see people selling something claiming it's less then AH. But as it turns out the AH has it cheaper.
---
You're wrong! I want my blood elf pally :(
---
Whats evil about hunters?
---
Choosing to stop at 13 is my biggest in game regret. 
---
I didn’t need the great staff and didn’t really care about the title then
---
It isnt just that, but stuff got buffed a ton. No gear had spell power back then, but my shadpw priest friend has just over 300 without setting foot in a raid (not sure he gets much from MC besided anathema, anyway).
---
Add in 1.12 talents and more skilled players, and it is a cakewalk compared to early vanilla
---
&gt; Well I would say that someone can still spec Heart/NS and take Improved Mark.
---
While this is technically true, there's almost no point to a HotW build without Furor because it basically neuters what makes it powerful for soloing/farming/questing/pvp. 
---
If you lose that flexibility, you might as well just go deep resto unless literally all you're going to do is tank and heal raids (because then you don't need the flexibility).
---
The most consistent trait of WoW players is that we’re all salty neurotic motherfuckers who hate each other and ourselves
---
Probably the O'Doyle family.
---
I see Trailer Park Boys. I press Upvote.
---
[Feel silly now?](https://imgur.com/gallery/praywDo)
---
When push comes to shove I think that is where we will go too. 
---
It's just tough to pull the trigger on that kind of decision because we're horde-PVE and the population isn't huge.
---
We have a lot of members approaching 60 however so we can hopefully afford a slow hemorrhage of casual players looking for easier handouts, while continuing to recruit.
---
Anyhow, the argument to be made for Axe spec:
---
\- Benefits more from Impale and Deep wounds  
---
\- As an MS warrior you want to aim for at least 25% crit unbuffed, just to have consistent crits, so axes are great when still gearing  
---
\- For Horde running with WF, having the extra 5% crit in addition to WF can be nasty
---
Sword spec pros:
---
\- The extra hit can also crit  
---
\- Since its a white hit, it also generates rage  
---
\- Can proc off of things like Hamstring
---
At the end of the day they're both very good. Go with whatever you have the best weapon for.
---
Well you know at this point it is probable that bwl is out before our priests get eyes.
---
Yea this is on r/yojamba as others have said!
---
Ooh good advice! Is the primary concern when you get to the runecloth levels or is it at all levels?
---
I have a ton of silk and some mage weave packed away. Would you recommend doing the same for lower level clothes or is it pretty easy to just do some instance runs for lowbies in exchange for drops?
---
Prove it.  Post a screencap of your characters on grob and deviate. Should only take you a moment.
---
Or be a cow and have +20 and not fail like ever
---
This was one of my favorite things so far in classic.  I was getting end game gear in BRD at 55, and farming the dungeons at 58. 55-60 was a fun time
---
You never use AE in pvp? Seems like you here just to argue.
---
No, not really. You’re just kind of a dickhead for shitting on a dude who made a big accomplishment is all :)
---
Yeah if you can snipe the kill. If you fail to snipe, then you’re just wasting mana.
---
I would STRONGLY recommend leveling further before you stop with your current class. You really don’t have access to anything at level 8. And you will eventually burn out on the grind to 60 no matter what class you pick. 
---
As for the difficulty of leveling a warrior, it’s not hard anymore when everyone knows what they’re doing and there’s plenty of guides and dungeon spamming. Let me tell ya, back in vanilla, it was incredibly hard. But nowadays with all the information, it’s slow, but very doable and not nearly as painful. It’s about a 6.5/10 on the difficulty scale. A lot of dungeon spamming. 
---
If you’re gonna level a warrior expect to tank, and learn how to do it. A lot of pressure tanking
---
Dont shit on others dreams. Let memes be memes man.
---
No. Been pretty easy for me!
---
It's not hard, it's tedious and slow.
---
Pretty much every other class has smoother leveling than warrior
---
&gt;You literally have no knowledge on the spec itself yet you are willing to parrot misinformation of them being "utter trash".
---
You are making a claim that is counter to all the theorycrafting and math that has been done on private servers for *years*.  For this premise you've cited one anecdote.
---
But you're accusing me of not substantiating my argument enough.
---
While Warcraftlogs doesn't separate our Boomkin vs Feral DPS sadly, we can see that the range of dps for druid is pretty wide.
---
 [https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/statistics/1000](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/statistics/1000) 
---
Assuming that feral is better than boomkin, which i think you've conceded, then we can conclude that the upper end of the range is mostly feral and boomkin would reside more towards the bottom.
---
Which would put them on par with retadins and dps shamans.
---
For the record...I wouldn't tell *any* casual to main a druid if they're looking for easy.  We bring the most utility, but we have to know multiple roles to be most useful and we have to work hard to be viable in certain roles.  I'm not selling casuals on druids at all, other than ease of leveling.
---
Really the only important thing is that in raids you want max ranked resistances for the content you are running. So for MC you'll want max ranked fire and shadow resist (shadow for fears).
---
Other than that, have a maxed focus dump, and you're good to go.
---
If you're soloing you may want more natural armor and stamina.
---
Even Varimathras calls her out on this. Like, when a Dreadlord calls you out on your shit you know you're in it deep.
---
The animal gets food and shit though. Using animals for various kinds of work has been around forever and never considered evil. Are people who hunt with hounds evil?
---
Meh, if it makes them sell quickly then it's worth it. 40s per cylinder isn't much to miss out on.
---
If you wanna play a warrior play a warrior. Leveling isn’t going to be a breeze with any class given you are playing your first character. Just do whatever looks fun to you. 
---
But yea it’s gonna be hard as balls without a pocket healer
---
25% isn't that much if it moves is it? You can sell more and faster. Making more money in the long run.
---
World of Warcraft should be renamed to World of Cluster B disorders
---
Well that's not true at all... Here is the same sample for locks and hunters.  They are both better on average that the prot warriors and incredibly better than rets.
---

Willing to bet you don’t have a real epic mount and went for the summonable one
---
Not hard just a bit slower than some classes
---
No. Only the action on the instance of the game that the input is tied to is coming from the keypress. The other actions are coming from a computer program that is actively running, taking the keypress and simulating it via the program, to mulitple other game instances it's running in the background. I can infinitely copy these presses in a way humans cannot do solely limited by the processing power of the computer(s) in use.
---
Do you agree or not?
---
Edit - to expand, in some cases it is the **exact same program** being used that people use to execute their automated script to have their character run and do actions without them at the computer.
---
Yes but if you use the button to switch to Wow UI, you lose the search functionality.  I guess you could use the WowUI if you wanted then switch to TSM UI when you want to search then switch back but I think I'd rather just browse than go through all that.
---
WTS Runecloth Bag, priced to move!
---
We were the KINGs of 5 man content. Pulled rooms at a time. On progression yes a warrior had an edge but paladin is much more fun and versatile. 
---
- What’s the pull order paladin? 
---
- This room. The hall. The next room. Then the boss.
---
As the person posting an item, if it's selling at the current price, then undercutting by a small margin is a better idea.  I would only undercut by a bigger margin if I didn't think it would sell.
---
As the seller, here's the thing:  everyone undercuts to put up on the AH.  So if I put up something for 2g/stack, and the next person puts it up for 1.99g/stack, then the next person will put it up for 1.98g/stack.  When someone comes through and buys a bunch, they'll buy them all, because they're similar prices.  If someone puts it up for 1.6g/stack, and then the next ones are 1.59 and 1.58g/stack, then someone's going to stop after buying the 1.6g stacks, because it's a huge jump up to 2g.
---
Even worse if that becomes the new normal.  An item that previously sold for 2g/stack suddenly becomes 1.6g/stack.
---
Now, I'm not going to whisper people about it when they undercut, I'm not the Price Police.  But unless an item is clearly not valued by the buyers at the listed price, there's no reason to undercut so deeply.
---
This is one of the two items that is crazy low level, but really impactful for druids.
---
So the first part which is manual crowd pummeler. (https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9449/manual-crowd-pummeler)
---
Feral's damage does not scale off weapon damage, it scales off of attack power and stats on gear. As such we can use a weapon with 1-2 weapon damage and a 600 delay, but if it has say +1000 agi + str on it, would be crazy for ferals. (Inflating numbers but the concept stands)
---
Which is where MCP comes in, while the weapon damage does nothing for ferals, and the stats on this item is "okay" not amazing, what it is used for is the effect. (Yes it does work for ferals!) Can be used in form, and it will give you 50% haste to your attack speed. Cat or bear this really does help a lot.
---
Moving on to the other item which is the Wolfshead Helm as you linked above, it has a unique effect that is absolutely nuts. +20 energy when you shift is really REALLY strong. (And is going to be best even through TBC sadly)
---
Since energy ticks up at a fixed rate, your damage would be fixed and the only way to increase, would be to get better weapons/gear. (Like rogues) But for ferals because we have Furor which grants energy every time you shift, you can shift during combat to generate 40 energy basically on demand. Add an extra 20 on this and it means for a small amount of mana, and a GCD, you can add an extra shred in your rotation.
---
The extra 20 energy cannot be replaced basically. It is about half a shread, which is hundred of damage.
---
I wish I could blink while riding.
---
What? What dont I understand?
---
How can one learn this art
---
That’s what I do when people undercut me hard. They make their quick buck, I make some ‘free’ money with just a little risk, I feel like everyone wins.
---
But they are still getting out dpsed by top "prot' warriors.
---
Oh yeah ibget what you mean, but I'd guess if they are savy in particular to Vanilla, then they probably played some private server
---
Yes and fuck no. If you think you can AFK in AV and get rank 14 then go for it.
---
I am dualboxing on mirage raceway and seen some multiboxers, but not many.
---
DKP is pretty garbage as it gives incentive to collusion and DKP hoarding. Any DPS that wants to really push their class is just gonna stack DKP forever til the weapon they want drops.
---
I have my main alliance rogue on one server, and made a horde alt mage on another server as I wanted to experience both factions. Of course if you’re not on PVP servers you wouldn’t have to do that.
---
I'm a paladin that on most pservers completely stopped raiding after BWL just because of PVP until naxx comes out. You've got to play pve and suck any dick you can to get any piece of gear from raid to have any chances against people fully decked out in pvp until you get to blue/purple sets (if you get any). Yes if you give ret and warr same amount of gear and same skill lvl warrior will do more dps but there has to be a way for a paladin that wants to be pvp focused to get gear without sucking every possible dick in theirs guild to get any kind of gear. Ret palas get a lot better in BWL with judgements and crit heavy items + weapons that not every warrior needs unlike BRE/spinal. There's a SHIT TON of ret palas that think with 1 mongoose and 1 titans they can be gods of the world, I'm not the best myself in pve because I know my guildies might think of me as a meme class idiot while raiding but the most fun for me and whole purpose of playing pala in vanilla for me is pvp and sweet SoC procs on people going from 100% hp to 10% in 1 sec.
---
I know my place in a raid group being best dispel-er in game and going holy whenever I only can to help the group but just let me live as a ret bringing all my consumes/food/flasks/buffs(if horde allows) to raid and give my best as a not pure dps class. It's just challenging to do as much as you can with a shitty dps toolkit for pve but in pvp rets can be in top same as windfury shamans.
---
ps - also having a ret in your grp you dont have to make one of your warriors be "nightfall bitch" for that sweet caster dps incrase
---
Meanwhile I am here at 299/300 😂
---
Because generally the cheaper price they offer is just minus the 5% cut the ah takes.
---
I think you misunderstood their comment, they mean going ret for pvp and holy for raids
---
Yep it is, but if u get used to it its np and if u manage to get good gear its a lot of fun atleast for me it is.
---
Love the off meta build, im making a melee warlock &lt;3 respect. Also, shadow elf for another combat drop
---
Warrior requires the most effort out of any class. You face tank everything with zero cool downs. Not hard per se, but long and tedious. Get ready to spend a lot of time farming for PREBIS and lionheart helm.
---
nah bwl is what at least 4 months out, probably 5-6. Most priest that are raiding currently should have their eye, unless super unlucky and leaf drops every week.  We don't even let hunters roll on ranged weapons because they will get their class weapon. 2 priest 2 hunters already have their things only a couple more to get we will have to start selling the eye or leaf.
---
I see where you're coming from, but there's a distinction between playing action-bar whack-a-mole (having a handful of abilities and mashing them as soon as their off cooldown), and abilities that are applied situationally.
---
Pallies appear to be an example of the former. 99% of combat is Seal+Judgement on cooldown: literally a single keystroke every 8 seconds. Single melee target? Mash the macro every 8 seconds. Single ranged target? Walk up to it and mash the macro every 8 seconds. One of each? Target whichever one's closer, and mash the macro every 8 seconds; when it dies, target the other one and mash the macro every 8 seconds.
---
A hunter is good example of the opposite. Melee target? Start by dropping a trap, and use slows and skillful movement to kite the target. Ranged target? Send the pet in and wait a second for it to establish threat before going full DPS. One of each? Have the pet tank the melee while you keep the ranged one occupied and right next to your character, and alternate between popping arcane shots / auto shots at the melee target, and raptor strikes / melee attacks at the ranged target.
---
Hunters are super fun, and can crank out tons of damage really efficiently when played skillfully. Pallies press a button every 8 seconds in pretty much every situation.
---
If you want a chill experience on a hunter, you *could* just sit back and crank out arcane shots on cooldown, but you have the option to optimize your output when inclined. Pallies, so long as you're hitting that macro every 8 seconds, you're playing optimally.
---
TLDR,
---
an arbitrary sequence isn't what's enjoyable; what is, is playing a class skillfully, but that's only an option when there's a learning curve to master. The learning curve for pallys plateaus at level 4 when you learn Judgement.
---
Eh most of the time copper ore is out of aggro range or the mobs don’t attack until attacked
---
Hear me out: press enter okay then shift click their name and it goes into your chat box.
---
Go warrior if you want to be wanted. Since you're new, it'll be a little rough. But if you're playing with friends, you should be okay. Learn early to tank, and you'll never feel left out :)
---
I dont need my binds in order. Ive played a mage for years and have everything I need within finger distant. It's more about where it is on the keyboard for me rather than on the bars. Fuck the bars
---
Unfortunately item restoration has a rarity/ acquisition method filter for what items it keeps track of so it doesn't have to record every piece of driftwood players vendor so it wasn't recorded in there
---
if someone undercuts you, buy it from them and sell it for your higher price
---
if this isn't possible because you wouldn't make a profit, then he's not actually undercutting you
---
Well if you do like 400 dps, 1% spell hit is worth like 6 dps. 20 spelldmg increases mind flay dps by 3 and swp by 1 so at that points it is 50% better.
---
It depends on your shadow power, but the more you have the better spell hit becomes and you have a lot.
---
I don't need HoJ, but I've gotten most of my prebis healing items already and I've only been there for quests, no actual farming yet.
---
my man. warlocks see an opportunity to help themselves here
---
Everyone talks about the hardcore STV PvP and UnGoro PvP, but there's no pvp like AH PvP
---
&gt; I'm pretty sure that I read somewhere that that was the original design. (It makes sense given the armor bonus, Omen of Clarity, increase to physical damage in Balance, etc) i.e. Boomkins were originally supposed to melee for more than just Clearcasting procs.
---
And it turns out it's Melee Moonkin is actually pretty solid dps in Classic as well, if you use a super-fast weapon and spam Moonfire. Not optimal dps (especially in later phases), but definitely good in PvP.
---
I post at suggested prices for many things, but for mats I make sure the price is right. Too many people drop things right at vendor price or sell 1 stacks ridiculously cheap.
---
lmao, so true
---
That sounds amazing. I need that in my life.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6BYzLIqKB8
---
Not that guy, but the short answer is "do whatever you think is fun". Really, do it. 10 people can kill Oynxia, first 8 bosses in MC can be killed by 40 randos you found in /1 at a bus stop (not coming down on pickups, they are fun).
---
Long answer: 
---
Rejuv has a 80% healing coefficient (i.e. if you have +100 healing, your rejuv will get +80 healing to the *total* amount healed, +16.6 per tick).
---
Healing touch has 100% coefficient (as long as you aren't casting such a low lvl one that its faster cast time? it's been a while since classic)
---
Regrowth gets 16.5% to direct heal, 63.3% to HoT
---
BIS lists tend to rank by Healing/mana spent, since in raids you are just chunking heals (HoTs lose out big in this regard), which makes +healing and downranking very good. If you want to use int heavy gear for HotW, a good rule of thumb is as follow: +healing "costs" about half as much as int on gear
---
So, all other stats equal, take int * 1.2 (hotw) * 2 (conversion to equiv +healing) and compare to the BIS item in question.
---
But really, just do it because its cool and no one else does it.
---
My real life friend has been telling all of our guildies that he played Enhancement Shaman in Vanilla and has a YouTube video somewhere of him "owning" in battlegrounds. I know for a fact he started in BC and played a Rogue lol
---
r/yojamba
---
I've been slowly buying up a bunch of lvl 19 &amp; 29 twink gear.  Depending on what they sell for, i think conservatively I'm holding at least 2,000g worth of gear if I hold it until phase 3.
---
Solid point, I'm at work and was just going off top of my head. Knew I forgot some.
---
Stealth - ctrl +1
---
Blind - V (mouseover macro)
---
Vanish - tilde key
---
Expose armor is on 5, I just don't use it much.
---
I'll probably rebind some at 60 or so to make use of those keys more, but this is just what I'm rolling with now.
---
No, only on the first tick.
---
If you use class colors zperl does. Mine looks nearly identical
---
Me TOO!!!
---
Surely. Feels great being on the other side of some mysterious joke.
---
Buy an Ornate Spyglass off the AH and use it to check if he's around. It extends the distance from which you can see mobs.
---
Wtf does holy dps paladin have to do w this?
---
 Your completely misinterpreting my post . I guess brains and people who like ret paladins dont mix.
---
Some terrible human being ruined the price of copper bars that were selling for 1g a stack. He started selling for 40s a stack. I emphasize with that guy. Like why do that bro? You would’ve made so much more money not undercutting like a maniac
---
If they patched it to just be on a CD, that'd be nice.
---
I thought middle mouse button was an inconceivable idea for jump, but it does give a nice little click and pop as if you preloaded for the jump. Might have to try it!
---
TBH I haven't met many hunters who take items that aren't optimized for their class and see many who pass on leather upgrades because there is a rogue/druid/warrior and they just don't want to deal with the drama.
---
Warriors on the other hand roll on everything.  The Hunter loot meme seems pretty dated at this point.
---
I was even in a pug MC a few weeks ago as a healer and looked at their loot priority list.  Hunters were allowed to roll on Giantstalker Gear and the leaf and that's it.  No weapons, no rings.  When the mail AGI bracers dropped from major Domo and a hunter the fury warriors threw a fit saying it wasn't BiS for Hunters.  (Seems better than GS to me unless you are 8/8.). The Hunter eventually gave in.
---
Important to note that Stoneform will also break blind and removing bleeds and poisons is great to get a fear bandage off.
---
Can also remove devouring plague from UD priests and +10% armor does not hurt for a warrior either
---
Price your auctions 1c higher than the lowest
---
Yeah thats why you put up a good deal to sell an item. You still put it up for xx.99 though. If copper ores going for 10 silver a piece I'd put up 10 for 74.99 and sell it quick. Depending on the market.
---
Bucko or Champ or Kiddo, anything to try and infantilize you.
---
So I cant even ask him how he's planning on dealing with two obvious issues?
---
Let's meet outside org then and see how your corpse tastes!
---
Haha nah I was a very dedicated arena player and this is a very very easy rotation of remembering abilities.
---
I could order them in the bars, but I have it heavily memorised to the keyboard more so than the bars. It works for me and i kick ass
---
Which addon let you move your player portrait?
---
Ribbly was patched this week, potentially with other BRD pathing. :-(
---
I give my priest my mooncloth cd because if he's getting stronger, the raid gets stronger. It's that simple.
---
If you’re not a main tank by now you never will be
---
Iv reported someone for safespotting for a solid 8 days in a row. He was in the same spot for hours each night and not only did I report him every night but at least 50 others did to. NOTHING was done against this person. He still is playing and still doing the same stuff. I think Blizzards staff was cut so much they just don't do anything for things anymore.
---
C'mon now saying warrior tanks can put out 400 DPS without issue is definitely an exaggeration. Warrirors putting out that much DPS are using a fury prot talent and dual-wielding. Even still that's like a 90th+ percentile DPS depending on fight. 
---
Like on Golemagg 400 DPS for a tank is 97th percentile. Other fights where tanks are pulling considerably more are usually padded by cleaving which isn't indicative of single target threat anyway.
---
I just farmed them in EPL at the lake in the bottom middle of the map. The drop rate doesn't seem so bad there. Either that or I got very lucky, and got 10 within three hours.
---
The margin still has to be big enough to make up for the AH fee.
---
Also, I WILL be taking the clearcasting spec eventually
---
49.49?
---
It’s also in the title. I’m a little dumb dumb.
---
I did Naxx too, killed all duh bosses... in WOTLK... Undying achievement anyone?
---
I refuse to play that talent outside of Vael fight
---
You’ll never catch me leadfoot myehhhh
---
The book alone sells for 1500g on my server so that's at 2500g swing for me.
---
Section 4.A: no loitering
---
I wish classic had Dungeon Finder
---
Yojambois
---
What is done about the cookie?
---
Had the raid taken a long time due to wipes or something? You know your schedule, unless it took longer than expected why would you join a raid you cannot complete?
---
They might be remembering when there was twink gear worth selling for BG alts. Then you would farm chests for it, and only have to be able to clear around them (using sub tree and every engy gadget you could). Then you would graduate to SM GY and Lib chests by the mid/late 30’s
---
i mean with 40 consecrates i dont even think whelps would be a problem lol
---
The GM grind on some servers required a full team of people playing around the clock constantly all for the benefit of one person.
---
I'm not talking about current classic preBiS. I'm aware of the item overhaul in 1.12. That doesn't take away from the fact that prior to the overhaul people still way over prioritized dungeon sets because they were designed for the class therefore they must be the best. Sure maybe the top guilds had a better grasp on things but I'd be anything the vast majority of players did not.
---
Damn, that dude who's harrassing him is a complete sociopath.
---
That didn't answer my question
---
I'd rather have beer.
---
&gt; What I will say is they might change their stance, because their current policy is inconsistent.
---
They won't, and the policy isn't inconsistent. It's remained the same since launch. Again, because multi-boxing isn't botting.
---
I stand by my previous statement: you have no personal experience with multi-boxing and have very little clue as to what you are talking about. Most MMO's that were around in the early WoW days allowed multiboxing. The Wikipedia on multiboxing even lists many of those games:
---
&gt;*Most game developers allow multiboxing in their games. To date, Age of Conan, Aion, Anarchy Online, City of Heroes, City of Villains, Dungeons and Dragons Online, EVE Online, Lord of the Rings Online, Heroes of Newerth,[citation needed] EverQuest, EverQuest II, Lineage, Lineage II, Vanguard: Saga of Heroes, Rakion Latin-Internacional, Warhammer Online and World of Warcraft all allow multiboxing. The Chronicles of Spellborn and Rift allow hardware multiboxing, but prohibit software multiboxing.*
---
But please keep parroting things you've read about how multi-boxers are bad. I'm sorry you got trashed by a 5-boxer and it's made you so mad you had to post about it. That still doesn't make it botting and Blizzard isn't going to change their policy.
---
Auctioneer is a great addon.
---
I’d wait till your a bit higher level. Most low level stuff sells for so little you make more money questing and censoring.
---
Using W for run is weaksauce. When you have a mouse, load on as many abilities as you can closer to your fingers, its logical that it would be faster and more deadly.
---
I know the binds look ugly but i played arena for years and for me THIS is the easiest and fastest way to play.
---
S and D for strafe, because everyone seems confused by it
---
gotcha. one last question. at how many mobs is it better to blizzard as opposed to frostbolt? my bolts are hitting around 415ish and my blizz ticks are around 95
---
Lmao the juiceboxes, good banter
---
Shit like sniping is basically the equivalent of botting, I wish stupid ass addons like this were banned.
---
Right and the talent makes it cheaper and therefore more available
---
I’m usually to busy with guildies. I don’t really want to interact with viewers it would be a boring stream.
---
Ya wtf?  If they move all day, he just made 40s profit (minus ah cut).
---
“Now listen up here, Buckaroo. What in rootin’, tootin’ tarnations do you think you’re doing mining them here ores o’ mine?”
---
What I took away from this..  
---
"Ret paladin! Better than nothing."
---
Seconded, you're also going to start seeing people's alts get to 60 and prepping to raid. There's always going to be a need for geared, competent players in a raiding guild
---
49.69

40 consecrates would make the land so pure that the microorganisms on the ground would start raising righteous hammers.

Damn, that's a pretty detailed resource

&gt; But really, just do it because its cool and no one else does it.
---
I wanna be the guy with the ridiculous impossible mana pool that wins the mana race because of attrition lol. 
---
Fights are short right now, so I'm not too worried about it honestly and definitely I'm not the guy to stress too much about BiS, but I am frustrated that a lot of "guides" don't explain all of this and just say "this is best" which totally triggers me because best really depends on your playstyle. (Am I spamming rank 4 HT so I don't overwrite the other druids' HoTs or am I tank healing, or am I raid healing, am I a HoTW healer or Moonglow healer, etc.)
---
Thanks for the numbers and extra information. That helps a ton.
---
If you really think about it priority for hand of rag really is Ret pallys and enhance shamans.
---
Warriors should be DW, if they are gonna go 2h bonreavers edge is better.  Hell, hand of rag doesn’t even make the top 5 for dps 2h when everything is said and done for vanilla.
---
Sick ass PVP wep tho.
---
Got the last two lvls in one day doing LBRS do runs. You get some serious xp out of that

I concur.

This is the kind of person clogging up GM tickets that could be time used on useful things like bug reports or exploiters.
---
Lol right?
---
I’ve found most people with serious accomplishments don’t bother mentioning them unless asked. I didn’t even know my GF was in Paragon until I heard a super similar voice in their Lich King world first video and asked her.
---
It makes sense if you think about it though. Druids in Classic are basically just inferior versions of other classes. Why go Feral when Rogue is a better Feral for DPS and Warriors are better Ferals at tanks? Why go Resto when literally every other healer is better? Why go Balance when Mages and Locks are better casters?
---
People just rather play the better class rather than being the jack of all trades and master of none.

I WANT MY TROPHY. Probably an adult, too. Yikes.

---
Tbh parry is decent while levelling but single target heroic is a good rage dump at 60 imo, not much use parrying in a raid as I wouldn’t have aggro
---
As long as they are in the raid and the instance they can get loot.
---
I assumed everyone would know when s1 took place.  I didn't know we were limiting the scope of this topic to vanilla only.
---
Start running Arena/Anger/Golem runs at like 52. That healer trinket and Omnicast boots are great. Jailbreak runs give the K-something shoulders too.
---
Don’t say sorry, reinforces the idea in his head that he is correct.
---
Sorry but he's right.
---
Thanks I’ll look into that.
---
Not so obvious considering they thought it wild a guild would have 5 hunters in a 40 man raid and a smart guild runs with 2. I’m not sure what mindset they are advocating for.
---
The only undercutting that drives me crazy is when a material is selling regularly for a price from multiple sellers with a few silver variance, obviously the market is willing to pay that price, and then somebody comes in and lists the same item for half price￼￼, and then more people start undercutting that and it tanks the item for a few weeks or until somebody buys them all out and relists them.￼
---
hes not looking to sell more, hes losing money because he wanted the 50s profit now instead 1g in a few more hours
---
this isnt some high demand market, youre gonna sell 20 max in a day if youre the only one selling. people arent suddenly gonna start buying this crap more just because its 40 silver cheaper
---
Use Leatrix Tunes (Classic):
---
[https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/leatrix-tunes-classic](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/leatrix-tunes-classic)
---
In the addon, search for 'gun' (without quotes).  You will get 8 results.
---
Ignore the first result for darkironkegshotgun.  The other 7 results for gunfire and gunload are what you want.

Notice how the files shown include the full path.  All you have to do is make that folder structure in your Wow folder.

So, take first file.. that is 'sound/item/weapons/gun/gunfire01.ogg#567721'.
---
So what you need do is make the folder structure 'sound\\item\\weapons\\gun' inside the Wow folder on your computer (ignore #567721, that's just the file data ID, not important).  So go into your Wow folder, create sound folder.  Go into sound, create item.  Go into item, create weapons.  Then go into weapons, create gun.
---
Once you have that folder structure created, you need to download the replacement sound that you want.  Download it from Wowhead.  To do that, first find the file in Leatrix Tunes.  So search for bow.  One of the files shown will be 'bowrelease'.  Now search Google for 'Wowhead sound bowrelease'.  That will take you to the bowrelease sound.  You can download it from Wowhead.  If it downloads without a file extension, rename it and give it an .ogg extension.
---
[https://www.wowhead.com/sound=1146/bowrelease](https://www.wowhead.com/sound=1146/bowrelease)
---
Put the new sound file in the 'gun' folder and name it the same as the files shown in your first Leatrix Tunes search (when you searched for gun).  So the first file would be named 'gunfire01.ogg'.
---
If you want to silence sound files instead of replace them, use a blank OGG file like this instead of the sounds from Wowhead:
---
[http://www.enhancedsmscallerid.com/home/media/Silent.ogg](http://www.enhancedsmscallerid.com/home/media/Silent.ogg)
---
(right-click the link and save link)
---
You can use this technique to replace or silence any sound files.  Leatrix Tunes will let you find the files and show you the file path and filename.  Just make that folder structure, put OGG files (either replacements or blank) in the end folder and rename them to the filenames shown in Leatrix Tunes.  Easy once you're used to it.
---
One of the most terrifying things is an angry bear chicken chasing you with a fucking dagger and burning you with moon magic.
---
&gt;Feral DPS is fine while leveling. 
---
It's more than fine tbh. Pre 40 the only class out lvling you is hunter
---
I've never thought of that, I'm curious to try it
---
To answer the second question first, you don't need to respec to prot until 5 minutes before the first raid you walk into. Arms/Fury are fine for dungeons and UBRS.
---
As for the 2H, I wouldn't do a dungeon run with solely a 2 hander passed ZF (though I've heard people say they 2 hand tank UBRS), but I still routinely open a pull with my 2 hander + sweeping strikes + whirlwind for the snap AoE aggro before switching to 1H/shield and continuing like normal.
---
Well yeah, 2 MC geared rogues can obviously solo it. But why do they not have a HoJ yet
---
They have very likely sold it to somebody else by now. Best go pick up your refund at least.
---
oh this is IF airport I come here all the time :)
---
I agree and understand.
---
You are agreeing with my original point. So let's please stop talking.
---
I am glad that the playerbase can inform levelling kittens, chickens and zappy bois that their dream of viable large group dps at end game isn't really going to happen.
---
So healbot gives you a set of raid frames that you use for the click to heal part you still have your character frame and target frame from the blizz ui unless you disable those yourself.  You can also set it to hide when solo etc so you don't always have it on the screen.
---
Tbh I'd be like that if I were surrounded by night elf girls, too.
---
As opposed to just "DPS".
---
and don't have to wait hour for an auction to end
---
Lol no free arb
---
I failed 7 subjects over a couple years also because of raiding and that damn pvp grind (stopped at r13) but I stuck with it and graduated
---
I used a few different builds in this video but the main one which you’re referring to was up to imp CoC in frost and then the rest into fire.
---
Your question was hyperbole and not relevant. If I use AE once - ever - regardless of how rare the situation and I have to say yes. Meanwhile the idiot mage plugged it into his damn PvP 'rotation'. You're intentionally trying to change the subject, sounds like you're just here to argue.
---
Multiboxing is not botting. Pressing 1 button to go to different clients is not bannable.
---
No where in here have I said Boomkin was the best dps class. All that the theorycrafting has shown is that it's not AS good as mage/warlock. That's it. Besides, are you actually involved in any of this TC or are you just saying that's what is being said? Boomkin wasn't even TC'd by the vast majority of the pserver playerbase, which is exactly WHY Thundercluck picked up the spec, so he could test it (He is also the person who theorycrafted the effectiveness of Nightfall, Spriest viability (which is barely if that), and Debuff slots). I trust his analysis more than an armchair redditor who has likely done 0 research on the topic.
---
&gt;https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/statistics/1000
---
&gt;Assuming that feral is better than boomkin, which i think you've conceded, then we can conclude that the upper end of the range is mostly feral and boomkin would reside more towards the bottom.
---
&gt;Which would put them on par with retadins and dps shamans.
---
&gt;For the record...I wouldn't tell any casual to main a druid if they're looking for easy. We bring the most utility, but we have to know multiple roles to be most useful and we have to work hard to be viable in certain roles. I'm not selling casuals on druids at all, other than ease of leveling.
---
So what you are telling me is that you like to look at one page on WCL, make assumptions about where specs lie, and then present that as solid data? What about the fact that the log I linked you shows a Boomkin having a 100% parse on a boss for ALL DPS Druids? 
---
You can claim it's an outlier all you want, and I can understand where you are coming from, but when all he did was cast starfire it's hard for me to accept the argument that "It's anecdotal because he's clearly a savant". 
---
What is even your argument? You first tried to say Boomkin is shit, which is definitely not supported by anything you've claimed. Then you pivoted to say it's not competitive, which while somewhat true, is not relevant to discussion. Not once in here have I said Boomkin was the most competitive spec, just that on Single Target fights it can perform just fine if not better than mages at times while also providing good utility in the form of Moonkin Aura, Innervate, and Battle Res. 
---
Not once did I advocate for anyone to play it or say that it's the next big thing. I just lamented at the fact that people like you will spread misinformation when they CLEARLY have 0 expertise or knowledge on the subject. Quite frankly it's laughable.
---
My guild has 'class leaders'.  The first week we had to pug so we free rolled.  This week, we did a new loot council system and they funneled multiple pieces into the class leaders.  
---
I'll see how it works out next week, but it's silly to be their farm bot, especially when you vastly outperform the class leaders and are more knowledgeable about the class.  Not talking about me, but we have some legit mages and warlocks and their class leaders are fucking donkeys.
---
I guess our guild has most of them. Theres like 5 in ours that are active. Heals, 1 dps kitty, 1 tank.
---
Or your guild makes more than one raid group... So your alt can go in that group and your main tank Will be the one for progression
---
ST was when it began to be difficult for me to stay alive as 2h arms tank.
---
But you dont need to switch to prot, you can still tank as fury or arms any 5 man in the game, so long as you have some tanking gear
---
You are a fucking idiot if you undercut by that much.
---
you can get to almost 80 from disenchanting alone, but it's super slow 60+.
---
Sometimes it does a few weeks later.  Sometimes it permanently tanks.
---
And I'm talking an item I sold at X for months before it tanked, so it did hold its value.
---
eeh I throw DPS in there sometimes just bc I'm hoping if a group is looking for DPS, than that word will pop out more than "warlock"
---
Im not even thinking about t1 pieces, it's just trash. I'm talking about plate hands, weapons, rings. Yea I wont be fighting for an item that's a bis for warriors but gimme that OBE or Flameguards before i waste my arcanites meant for sulfuras on strongholds. I pass all the leather shit, I'm literally interested only in pvp focused items
---
Gimme even a chance rolling for BRE knowing that I plan to hardcore rank when p2/3 releases not wasting it to a warrior thats gonna log in twice a week just to raid.
---
I don't have to cry because my guild officers are quite ok with letting me to loot but I know there might be loot salty warriors who are about to /gquit just because I got an item they did not need but they mad just becuase ret got it, been there seen that
---
I’m way past that anyways, but good to know.
---
Bigger mounts can get you stuck on shit
---
So true. These dudes get annihilated and then bring 4 other people to avenge them. Our server is like 2:3 ally to horde ratio
---
Sounds like something a class with bad 31 pt talents would say
---
I think those are all periods.
---
Lordaeron? Fun times there. I feel like the buffing of bosses made raiding quite interesting and it was nice seeing people developing these strategies for previously trivial bosses.
---
4 months isn't to terribly long to wait for it, we'll say 3 months thats still 12 more runs of major domo, and guilds will most likely start splitting the raids up.
---
It's awful if you're an asshole, or a few people are assholes.  It's great if nobody's an asshole.
---
You should really take distract off your stealth bar if it’s there.
---
yes lets compare one of the most in demand items with a super niche item. youre a moron
---
What you want is a [Hand of Edward the Odd](https://classicdb.ch/?item=2243) for some instant starfire fun.
---
&gt;Most wipes are not caused by bad players but simply not understanding the underlying strategies.
---
My experience has been the opposite, or maybe its both being bad and not understanding the mechanics because they are bad.
---
Almost every wipe has been due to DPS not letting the tank get sufficient threat, pulling aggro, and it leads to the boss doing it's aoe in the raid. And of course there was there was the Baron attempt where the Mage had the living bomb and didn't move out of the raid, even when I called his name over discord. It was not even the first attempt, and every mechanic had been explained.
---
I find the strategies to be relatively simple in MC, people just don't seem to follow simple directions or they are just too enamored with seeing there name at the top of the DPS charts that they have to risk wiping the raid to do so.
---
I absolutely think you’re right. They haven’t done shit to any of the safespotters or griefers, rp name change reports are ignored, its pretty hands off on their end.
---
It’s all cosmetic, no mechanical differences unless you’re talking about water strider mounts and stuff but those aren’t in classic anyway
---
I'd love to correct him and very likely have me reassigned to heal the raid instead, though we have a crap ton of resto shamans smashing the meters with their chain heals.
---
I get the whole deal with the downranked Healing Touches hey no problems there. I just wonder if I'll be able to keep up with the others who can seemingly do it better than I can.
---
The context of this post is that very few people did it. It doesn't matter who even tried it.
---
Very, very few people did it. The rest is meaningless semantics.
---
24,000 people out of 7 million PLUS players is an absolutely microscopic amount.
---
Blink, frost nova, cold snap, frostbite, polymorph, etc
---
Letting a Paladin burn through his oh shit cooldowns is extremely easy.
---
I hope it didn't come off as rude just linking the spec, but I felt it was just way easier to show than tell.
---
Blood elves would never give allegiance to the alliance that left them for dead and we're outraged when they took assistance from Naga to ensure their own survival
---
Ret is a PVP spec.
---
You need at least 3 of the same class for it to be worth it
---
Yeah lol. I was molten strike build. So. Yeah.
---
haha like wide? I was wondering that about Kodos but I'm Alliance so
---
Holy paladin is *the* support class taking huge dumps on priests, shamans, you name it. 
---
Try to kill a 5k health holy paladin with 60% physical armour mitigation. Killing a holy paladin with his warrior entourage is like killing a raidboss and his OP adds.
---
Shatter or ice shards for aoe frost mage spec?
---
Not sure if the crits from shatter + flamestrike outweigh the crit bonus of ice shards on cone of cold?
---
I *will* be fishing for clear casting states *eventually*
---
First rule of world of warcraft : If tis is red, TIS IS DEAD.
---
Taller or wider
---
Yeah we're 5 too. What wasyour friend's classes? I heard druid tank, warx3 and heal is pretty strong
---
It's not a new word at all, you just disagree with it because it does not fit your narrative.
---
All multiboxing software does is it "rebroadcasts" keypresses,  just like keyboard and mouse software do.
---
So again, is it botting or not?   Please answer this time.
---
Apparently sm is pretty good farm for warriors
---
Heh, I also build both sets but money is not a problem when you run strat this much. Got epic mount, truefaith and about 2000 g.
---
It isn’t bad if you haven’t leveled anything else. Hit 60 on my warrior and felt it wasn’t too bad, until I started leveling my Warlock. Warriors kill things slowly and have more downtime between pulls than almost any other class.
---
No matter what aoe spot you're grinding, you're taking a lot of damage...
---
The problem is you have no shot at a weapon unless you hoard, and weapons are kinda the most important part for a DPS, and there's not enough weapons that you can just "wait your turn". 
---
Class collusion is probably even worse and no way around that for decay. Just get people to min roll for tier pieces and whatnot that way you have as much as possible to compete for actual loot.
---
Loot Council is only trash if the people running it are awful at it, otherwise it's by far the best system.
---
Well if you are doing dungeon it changes since threat is a thing, but in the world versus 2 mobs id sheep one if possible and single target the second, for 3 mobs you might as well aoe.
---
As a member of the horde, fuck these guys.
---
thanks buddy :)
---
Horde or alliance?
---
Because of the new expansion?
---
Awesome I’m excited thanks everyone.
---
you can fuckin pvp inside of that thing??
---
Yes that is botting. I said so. Unless you're using 5 keyboards and pressing them, you are botting as a multi-accounter.
---
There's no other way to interpret it.
---
I normally don't bother with CC in 5 mans. With casters it's kind of a situational thing. If I can get in range I like to make the casters my charge target so I can make sure I get back to them. If not then after you sweeping but before you whirlwind you can run through the pack toward the casters to make sure they get hit by the WW. The range is deceptively large on it.
---
If the pack is more than 4 mobs you get in a bit of a pickle because WW only hits 4 mobs. In that situation you can modify the rotation a bit to include a battle shout for some snap threat on all mobs, but don't expect it to hold the ones that WW doesn't hit for long. Expect to make liberal use of your taunt and mocking blow as it's honestly not feasible to hold solid threat on more than 4 mobs when everyone is AoEing like crazy.
---
Blessing of Freedom has 4 seconds of down time and paladins can cleanse magic.
---
This ain't TBC. All you have is polymorph to run away.
---
Except those Lordareon humans would be forsaken nowadays.
---
As u/joebobby1523 said down below
---
&gt;These aren’t Prot warriors. They are full dps fury warriors face tanking because the healers are good enough to keep them alive.
---
So it's more like
---
Fury &gt; Locks and Hunters &gt; Ret
---
I would personally just buy the lower level cloth unless it is exceptionally expensive. You could spend a couple hours farming 5-10g worth of cloth, or you could farm gold for 2 hours and get 100g and just buy the cloth with that gold. 
---
Mageweave is usually pretty cheap due to mage zf farm, but it may vary per server. Wool is often more expensive, but you don't actually need that much and it is a bit of a pain to farm so probably still worth just buying. Silk should be cheap due to SM. Runecloth you need the most of and is likely the most expensive. You could farm it if you want, but my personal philosophy about farming gold instead still applies. It's why I didn't care about buying at a slightly higher price. I probably spent an additional 15g or something to Max tailoring quickly, but it was worth the time savings for me. if you don't want the robe immediately, it's better to hold onto the runecloth you get and gradually buy it. Depending on the patterns you get, it probably will be around 1000 that you will need.
---
Two wrongs don’t make a right, but I sure wish blizz would just ban people like this
---
They need to just nerf the item. A druids BiS weapon should not come from a level 30 dungeon.
---
if enough players do it the automated system should kick in without gm intervention
---
Horde. Standing in front or Roxxik in org and he doesn’t offer anything. Went directly to the goblin in Tanaris and he also won’t teach anything without the quest referral.
---
Go to your main city and talk to your eng trainer.  It's a level 35 quest.  Might not show up on questie or mini map.  Mine was in Org.
---
So your entire loot system revolves around "If you don't agree with what people think, you're being an asshole". 
---
I can't imagine this going south in any way.
---
The quest giver is in UC
---
Oh nice. I'm a little slow at lvling my dwarf shadow priest and haven't needed to try breaking the blind yet. That makes it even better. Now if only I could cast abolish disease and fear ward in shadow form...
---
“Lf 3 mages H shattered halls”
---
Some paladin probably:
---
“Hold my mace”
---
The actually left a lot of it alone, most of the of the dots tick for exactly the same amount in vanilla and wrath
---
Except in wrath you had like 10x more hp lol
---
Tauren can barely wear shoes
---
nobody NEEDS coffee but we enjoy it.
---
Just wanted to say if I wasn't intentionally following someone around stealing their ore and they messaged me this I would 100% start doing so afterwards.
---
Horde is actually just PvE on a PvP server.
---
Why yes I do find Dark Pact underwhelming
---
I always laugh at that line. Like what guy hasn't at least thought about it when they were young?
---
BricKsop-Reddit is ignoring you.
---
Ok, sounds like you don't mind tanking. What I'm saying is if someone wants to play a dps druid and they don't want to tank that's not wrong and it's not their "fault" if a group refuses to let them join simply because they think druids can't dps. Druids CAN dps and a group will run fine with druid dps. So if that's what the druid wants to do and they don't want to tank it's not their fault if groups refuse to take a feral druid simply because they think druids should be tanks or healers and nothing else.
---
Will it be harder for this druid to find a group? For sure. Should groups refuse them as dps? No. That's the groups fault for being picky and elitist.
---
Raptor Strike spec is best spec right
---
can you explain this more?
---
Naxx was June 20th 2006, 1.12 was Aug 22, 2006.
---
Same as the blood elf leadership was changed I guess. The forsaken also were the only ones willing to give aid against silvermoons plight of the scourge
---
&gt; I hope it didn't come off as rude just linking the spec, but I felt it was just way easier to show than tell.
---
Yeah definitely the best way to show it, man. I never considered taking both. My build, I'm taking Improved Rejuvenation, Insect Swarm and Improved Enrage because I like to PvP and Furor+Enrage into Bash is super useful and I really like having an extra DoT.
---
EDIT: I could still do something like: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/--55501310001
---
&gt; Priests can in fact wand from 1-60
---
&gt; all you need is your voidwalker out and a finger to press shadowbolt a few times
---
None of that means it's how they level. A warlock leveling with VW and shadowbolt is leagues slower than any other normal person playing a warlock. Just because you played these classes like a moron while leveling doesn't mean everyone did.
---
20/0/31 ret Paladin holy “Offspec” I dmg all I want and can heal through endgame dungeons and some raid content no problem in case we need to fill. 
---
I predominantly play with 4 friends doing quests and dungeons. We’ve got a Ret pally, dps feral Druid, disc priest, prot warrior and destro lock and I have a blast every time with very few wipes if any. 
---
God forbid I try and pug in a grp and get laughed at for playing a “meme” class and refusing to heal like I’m meant to. People need to get bent. The endgame content was beaten in 5 days. I repeat. 5......days. By like lvl 58’s barely trying. Don’t sit there and tell me my ret paladin and feral cat buddy can’t come because it’s not gonna work. That shit needs to die.
---
They will buy yours though if its 40s cheaper. Thats the whole point. You don't have to like it. Its called competition.
---
Tauren on Kodos have to dismount on the way into UC.
---
I've never noticed before but the guy from the South Park episode has a dope view of the city. OP is the worse of the two versions.
---
The only thing I have seen work is the automated responses such as a mass report for spamming will get someone silenced or a mass report on someone's name will flag it to be changed next time they log in...I haven't seen 1 thing happen to anyone that an actual GM had to step in and handle a situation...griefers and safespotters are apparently safe.
---
what did you use to farm that much? I got a behind a bit on farming unfortunately.
---
The former. Raid resets are fixed dates, not based on when you do it. Molten core resets every 7 days on Tuesdays, Onyxia resets every 5 days so it doesn't neatly line up like MC, but it's still a fixed 5 day schedule.
---
Super for AOE
---
If you want Gnomish goto ratchet
---
Yojammers unite
---
arugal bad
---
Casuals are casual
---
Report back with your findings
---
"You've taken everything from me!"
---
"I don't even know who you are"
---
I don't see us splitting the raid as our recruitment policy is "rather 36 man raid than benching 3 players". Onyxia can be split but not rag.
---
Really? Manners? This isnt about manners.  It's a free market. Someone puts something up at whatever price they want and either it sells or it doesnt. That's it. Undercut by a 1c or 1g doesnt matter. If it sells it sells.
---
Let the person potentially losing money worry about the price. Otherwise buy him out.
---
I have never had to run from a Paladin. Frost mages aren't that squishy and there are plenty of snares and instant casts to keep you at bay. The only thing I rather fight than a Paladin is a warrior.
---
Um.. that goes without saying. Is like telling someone driving a car to keep the gas on to move forward.
---
My /played is so skewed from taking the first week off and never logging off to avoid que times. I still keep myself logged in when I'm home so I can come and go from the game lol..
---
If it was on a CD, then druids would lose the one thing that makes them good, which is the ability to chug through Crowd Pummelers.
---
They'd just become a shittier melee instead of a melee whose burst phase length depends on how much Crowd Pummelers they have.
---
Or make the class viable without it?
---
Haha yeah man cant wait til I can wield a Searing Dagger with firestone off hand , learn sword proficiency for now until then! Having a blast
---
*By the Holy Light!*
---
For 1v1 we bet x amount of gold then we both roll, higher roll wins. 
---
We also do buy in lottery, everyone puts in x amount and the highest roll takes the whole pot.
---
I have VERY good luck with rolls.
---
And those top ret paladins are doing tings like getting chain cast Power Infusion's on them to pull their numbers. You know, spells that could give more overall to the benefit raid if cast on actual DPS characters.
---
You mean the baddie rets who think they are DPS instead of actually a support.
---
It does not matter if you are a elemental, enhancement shaman or a retribution paladin. The task remains the same: support your team and make sure your warrior has BoF, your 2nd warr has BoSac and your warlocks/mages get BoPed when pressured.
---
You swing your weapon when your cleanse duty is fulfilled and some damage is required on the kill target.
---
If you run around with flameguard, onslaught  and lionheart guess what. You gimp yourself by having a pitiful manapool and everybody hates you for going oom by spamming judgements.
---
However that's the average retribution paladin BoFing himself and not healing the dying warrior in front. And thats why they are called lolret or retardin.
---
It's not so much the spec but the attitude that goes alongside it. Lolrets forget that their role is support and try to do pitiful DPS instead of doing everything aforementioned.
---
That guy would hate me. I put everything on the AH for half price. I ain't here to make money, I'm here to make bag space 😅
---
Did you google where the guy is to get the quest?  The guy I thought was the Armorsmithing guy, was in fact not the guy I had to talk to to specialize.   Trainer told me I could specialize and said who to talk to.
---
And while that is great to buff my own healing numbers, it’s a net negative for the raid and is not good. Because I basically just wasted my other druids mana, used my mana, but we only get 1 heal.
---
Would love to 1vs1 you but not really willing to give my username on reddit for WoW. And of course I meant counterspell.... imp for silence. Also you are going to be slowed frequently and often fighting a frost Mage, again you may be able to free yourself after the short cooldown but we only need half that time to create more distance.
---
Could go mostly frost and pick up shatter + ice shard+ imp blizzard and only go as far in to arcane for clear cast
---
That's true. You said nobody needs that many add-ons, which is true. Nobody needs add-ons period, also true.
---
I probably have 35-40. Don't need any of em.
---
It literally isn't agaisnt the TOS, they've said this before.
---
Obviously the real reason is more accounts = more money.
---
Warrior is a bit of a learning curve if you're new to WoW, but it's FUN.
---
That sounds pretty unbelievable to me, but I still have screenshots from back then and still remember how often we wiped to clear ZG and how happy we were when got Hakkar down... (ZG obviously being our first raid, not MC)
---
Kentic Amice, which is great until you can get Burial Shawl from Scholo. there's also the Spritecaster Drape from Houndmaster if you can get people to do that too. Arena also has a good belt if you get the right boss. tho, getting people to hit up those two bosses in Arena runs might be a bit difficult.
---
That's how it was on lightnings blade.
---
I ran with a night elf wait named Ragnaros back in the day and he finished the grind but was never near the top like they were. They had a list of who would get it each week and rotated to help that person.
---
It is a downgrade.  It looked like it was, but my dmg range goes down, attack power goes down, critical chance goes down, and attack speed gets quicker.  Literally nothing positive for equipping it other than the chance on hit.
---
I can tell you, without question, that Stalaag is 3:1 horde.
---
Dual spec I think was introduced during wrath at some point
---
Yeah this doesn't happen by accident.
---
For whatever reason, OP was out for this guy.
---
Is it worth taking imp thorns as a feral for a tank spec, or is that something that one usually relies on a resto druid for?
---
and going above and beyond what you are expected to do, is how you kill bosses faster.
---
lol funny thing is. our main tank Baclone is a former rank 14 rogue and I raided Naxx on my Night elf rogue Jimmyw in Holy Warriors alliance side on Frostmane EU. checkmate!
---
How much extra rage is generated?
---
It's definitely not speccing into improved renew like some guides say because all of our priests are using it. Raw healing per tick sounds more likely, I can sometimes overwrite by mistake and other times get the "more powerful spell is active" message
---
100% not caused by in game whispers.
---
"Thats not how this works. Thats not how any of this works!"
---
MC can take 6hrs.
---
No they've said using multiple accounts isn't against TOS. Automation software is explicitly not allowed
---
Wait so if there's set values, how do you decide who gets it? How is DKP even relevant at that point?
---
Or were looking to have fun, but how dare we have bad wrong fun?
---
I mean... I almost wiped a group in VC because I forgot about the stealth mobs in front of Smite. Shit happens lol
---
because they are a joke not to be taken seriously, much like memes.
---
So you're saying the matchup was more favorable in TBC?
---
It's a way to bait sales. Annoying, but I guess I can respect the hustle. I just don't bite.
---
I've heard less than 5% of that 7 million had a level 60. Then knock out how many had time to commit 30 hrs a week to raid.  Context matters. The same people who could do it then are likely to make time for it again.  People make time for things they enjoy. Theres minimal skill, its simply saying hey was this your passion for a bit?
---
Normally, people are nice, but with Devilsaurs all bets are off.
---
I hope it happens on Deathcharger's Reins
---
Both.
---
And I am over here just waiting for my server to stop putting stuff in the AH at normal sell prices... If a stack of silk sells for 30S... WHY THE HELL ARE YOU PUTTING IT IN THE AH FOR 30S A STACK!?
---
&gt; Because we are all of that rolled into 1
---
Not really unless you're OK with paying 40g to keep respeccing.
---
Solo questing yes. Dungeons no, warriors are amongst the fastest
---
It was good, tbc had a taunt, really the biggest thing keeping paladin from being raid MT material.
---
Yes but if aoe grinding just use the highest int/stamina gear you have since blizzard scales terribly with spell power.
---
10/10
---
If you have combo points on one target and use a mouse over macro to cast blind on a second target, do you lose the combo points on the first target?
---
And if ur a mage or have some movement speed aids, the moment u see an ore while ur on follow, reach there before him and mine it &gt;:)
---
Friend eh?
---
&gt;at least half of them were rank 14
---
Maybe they are confused and actually mean that they usually rank 14/15 on the HK board when they play a game of Arathi Basin?
---
I barely run into people bragging about this so I don't know who you are running with.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/8kcgtt/the_real_list_of_59_useu_guilds_that_cleared_naxx/
---
A lot of guilds cleared naxx, 135 of them.  That's a lot of people.  I was in Avant Garde.  I killed KT once, maybe twice before I quit going into BC.  I couldn't tell you much about any of the fights. I couldn't tell you much about MC until we cleared it recently.  I had stopped running MC so many years ago.  Further, after BWL when the guild I was running imploded I stopped being a lead theorycrafter/strategy person and so my knowledge of the raids started to be nothing but "as a resto druid I am assigned to heal xyx and stand here and not stand here and do this one thing on this one boss".  So I could barely give you a summary.  
---
That doesn't mean I wasn't there.  That doesn't mean I give a shit if anyone believes me. I also don't brag about it.  Basically nobody in my current guild knows.  About all they know is I'm the "feral tank druid". It's pointless to brag about it, it wasn't a lot of skill mostly no-lifing (hence quitting). I use what I do recall to fix things my guild is doing poorly.  We were being dumb with lava pack so I fixed that.  Tanks were getting splattered trying to sync up pulling garr so I taught them hunter pulls. Our melee lead was pulling the melee group out too soon on Naxx so I helped him fix his timing. Also some stuff was just completely misunderstood back then (or if it was understood I forgot).

Sorting items by when they turn yellow gave me an idea of some good options that were not Runecloth Bags. Mooncloth (When not on CD), Runecloth Cloak, Runecloth Belt, and potentially Brightcloth Robe are viable options. Levelling an Alt to 5 for disenchanting may provide more return gold than Vendoring them, and I recall just making yellow items from 290-&gt;300.
---
Lot less funny now
---
Thats why I originally asked:
---
&gt;Which server has pugs that can clear MC in 1.5 hours?
---
Sold the account not long after I failed out of college. Needed the money at the time. Inb4 some comment about not being able to prove it.
---
92*
---
Friends. Nice
---
I know it isn’t the smart move, but coming from someone who doesn’t want to be broke (but also has no interest in playing the market) I just find it on the auction house and put mine up for 75% of the cheapest
---
I know I lose money this way, but I don’t want to play the market, and I don’t care if I make full market value. I assume someone out there will either resell or be very happy with the price, and I’ll get to quickly post my junk each night knowing I’m going to log in to sales the next day
---
you clearly misunderstood the post.
---
I’ve noticed people in this game REALLY like to shit talk and then ignore you lol
---
I make new accounts and spend $15/mo just to spam their mailbox with thousands of mail and get banned. I'm HWL of AH PvP.
---
That was the point though, they were used as training dummies and for weapon skill-ups.
---
We have 2 druids with 5/8, one druid with 3/8.... One of the 5/8 is me.... our feral druid...
---
Our priests on the other hand are crying for ANYTHING.
---
(We have seen 3 leafs btw out of 3 kills, there was a pug run the week prior and they got a leaf as well)
---
Buy low. Sell high. Undercut? Buy.
---
I am playing on Skullflame, EU. There a lot of players doing dungeons like BRD and DM. The thing is that most guilds are just bunch of friends that prefer to play together. If you are not in a guild, your chances are lower of finding groups after lvl 55. Another thing is that there is still layering on most servers. Once it’s removed you will notice huge amount of people in OG and SW. My advice is just keep playing and try to find some people to play with. The community in classic is super important. In 2-3 months I believe blizzard will add paid realm transfer and you can move to a more populated realm. Just my 2 cents. Take care and stay cool!
---
They know nothing of what real grinding is.
---
I agree, I don't think you are "shitting on others' dreams".
---
There is a difference between doing something off-meta, and trying something that is doomed from the get-go and not viable, this seems like the latter.
---
Because HoJ doesn't exist. My friend has killed angerforge over 90 times and has only ever seen the same 3 drops. I've only killed him 20 or 30 times but I've only ever seen the chest or the axe.
---
Could be death knights to horde and demon hunters to alliance. For example, choosing a Night elf warlock makes a demon hunter; not sure whether dk could be implemented in a similar manner.
---
Because nobody MC'd him, he joined us in Burning Steppes and RP walked all the way into the Valley (before guards went bananas).
---
I'm at 25 on my rogue, went Riposte first but had the same dilemma as you.  I think getting Riposte first is the right way to go, mainly because it's a cheap (10 energy) attack that will increase your DPS more than 5% hit.  At least at the current level and weapon damages.
---
if someone is selling silk for 30s, buy it and craft into bandages, then vendor it. that's a 10s/stack profit for about 2 minutes of work
---
In the end the only thing that matters is to play something you enjoy. If its the best or not doesn't matter, all classes are playable in my opinion.
---
Yeah I remember weapon skill parties with these type of mobs all the way up to Wrath. In both Org and SW.
---
Wahoo, I keep being more and more wrong hahaha!
---
In any case I hope he’ll be around to post when his mate will have it!
---
It is, which makes it an insane weapon for lvl 39 twinks. I won't be surprised if it goes for hundreds (if not thousands) of gold in phase 3.
---
Rets need a bit of love too.
---
Shadow priests are S tier in pvp just fyi. They melt faces with insane single target dps and as you mentioned, they have shield and insane healing. If you roll an undead you will also get access to Will of the Forsaken, which is basically a get out of any movement impairing effects free card.
---

\#NoChangesMeansTheyShouldBePullableToStormwind
---
So a shaman?
---
You can sell things that are only sold by vendors to one faction, on the Neutral AH to the opposing faction. That is how it was intended. Selling items across faction is not against the ToS, as it’s literally implemented in the game by Blizzard
---
Not a rogue.
---
Humans are the only potentially vegan meat, not because we aren't animals (we are), but because we're the only animals capable of consent. So if you want a vegan steak, just get someone to consent to you chopping them up.
---
Didn't it get nerfed? Or is it still worth doing?
---
Almost broke my neck...
---
Most people are to be fair, but occasionly you get that "one person" who wants it all.
---
My guild is tempted to during BLW launch.
---
In Australia?
---
As a mage I am waiting for this to happen like 10 times.
---
Except a Tauren without shoes has brown/black hooves- not bright green Y feet. Trolls are aesthetically ok in  classes where the feet are sorta covered - clothy and shaman skirts. Idk, it just bothers me on a Warrior or Rogue.
---
this is wholesome. i wish i could just pop out of invis on horde players and give them a little boop without being brutally murdered.
---
I... I don’t know why I never realized you could pick it up.
---
Turning favorites into villains just because they didn't have time for a story and people complained that in vanilla WoW there were no familiar faces/enemies from Warcraft 3. Every raid besides Naxx was a fresh idea but apparently the majority at the time didn't like it. 
---
They've stated this in one of the earlier interviews. It's why the Blood Elf story line is garbage and has no real leader. Illidan/Kael/Vash should have had a proper story other than, secretly making an army to fight the Burning Legion which they barely do anyways.
---
That's an un-answerable question. How much damage are you taking? Popping this on a solo non-elite vs a raid boss is going to give you wildly different answers. You can do the experimentation yourself to see what it is.
---
Yeah youre right.  People dont like people muscling in to their jobs.  They do stop reacting if you stick around though.  There's nothing they can do.
---
Having some items fall to the point they aren't profitable to sell anymore is not an example of the free market working best.
---
You don’t actually cast heroic strike tho. You cancel it before it goes off. The talent is worthless for that. Don’t give people advice when you don’t know anything, please. You are creating new idiots.
---
If you are horde they did warrior, shaman for WF, priest, Druid, and rogue. WF melee cleave is just insane on horde. They had a total under 5 days played to 60 together.  You could easily play around with the classes though, the bigger factor is getting everyone online together for dungeon grinds
---
What's the range indicator addons called
---
edit: nvm saw you answered in another comment
---
Do you really think one guy (working under *Dalaran,* which soon became neutral anyways) bullying their now-gone leader should trump the fact that the Horde...
---
Includes the Forsaken, who have a demon as one of their leaders and also *worked with Garithos for a time.* (Before murdering him, to be fair)
---
Includes orcs, who sieged their city during the Second War to assist their sworn enemies, the Amani.
---
Meanwhile the Alliance includes the Night Elves, who assisted and saved the Blood Elves in Silverpine Forest, as well as the Humans who've been age-old allies of the elves (and, other than Garithos who was Lordaeronian serving Dalaran (neither of which now represent the Alliance), never really offended them).
---
If you buy "Garithos was the problem" how do you explain them not just working with Dalaran, but becoming one of its prime members in Wrath as the Sunreavers?
---
\[laughs in stalagg\]
---
&gt; 1,000 threat-per-second with 9 of any one class
---
9 of any one class is 1026 threat with a single cast but with 1.5 seconds between casts... So 684 threat per second before any damage from the paladin is counted.
---
Its still better than this perfect-world-optimal-warrior output claim, and more sustainable, but its not 1k TPS.
---
Hybrids are cool, throw in some feral offtanks that can be heroes if a tank drops, have a spriest if you have enough locks...but there is nothing more useless than a ret. Go holy for raiding. You can meme whatever you want outside of that.
---
&gt; It's ten times more likely that the raid is wiped by pulling aggro off the tank then it is from having insufficient DPS. Give the tank time to build threat, your damage can wait.
---
There are **NO** DPS checks in the game at this time. It's all mechanics.
---
"Heed the warning" LOL. What a chump.
---
likewise.
---
Personally I'd use Perdition's Blade as an offhand weapon probably before I would use it mainhand. It is a fast attack speed weapon so a great offhand, but Fury wants a slower mainhand usually. Deathbringer/Perdition's would be god mode for an orc.
---
The link seems to have been temporary
---
Nope, that's why mouseovers are great.
---
It is not killing in itself but the guy went so far as to stalk and continue insulting her in-game for revenge on bringing up his already deplorable actions of safe-spotting.
---
It's just a bit of death. Nothing permanent. You'll get over it eventually.
---
Go back go retail scrub
---
Oh man... I remember one druid in Lights Hope winning WSG by himself. I agree with you, druids are the Swiss army knife. However I am not sure that feral druid is a good dps end game, also can they tank raids?
---
^ My biggest annoyance in wow right after the booty bay non mounting policy. I know I'm beefy but I just want to ride into that damn doorway like a big boy.
---
I'd rather this subreddit be honest even harsh about hybrids. It means players know what they're getting into. Promoting toxic thoughts though doesn't help anyone.
---
But yeah, 15 years ago I'd have liked to be warned that I wouldn't be wanted as a kitty when I mained my druid... I would have played a rogue instead, and avoided being dragged along by optimism.
---
That's terrible.
---
Man Im literally a fury warrior, I'm just saying more often than not a mage is very helpful to have. I'm honestly surprised how many people hate mages just to hate em.
---
There’s plenty of players still making alts and just joining etc, it won’t be flooded as day one but that’s probably a good thing
---
That's how it's done.   
---
And sometimes undercutting by a decent amount is smart. Sometimes the stuff listed up there is for a stupid price that isn't selling. It just all depends on the market. There are plenty of times when a 40s price drop is entirely reasonable.
---
On my server, they call in friends from the opposite faction to gank you.
---
Oh idk, did it? I've never done this so I wouldn't even know
---
I think you misinterpreted the argument being made. There's a ton of factors to consider in an upgrade, not just DPS, and that's definitely not what was said.
---
I'm sure I give out plenty of reasons for people to think I'm a twat. If trying to write properly is twattish, I'm fine with that. But I think the real twat is one who criticizes others for trying to write (or do anything) properly. I mean, "proper" means something good.
---
Thats DW  tank. Daggers are good for tanking.  For DPS Human warriors would obviously be going for the swords... Orcs for Deathbringer... (Other races clearly aren't interested in PVE minmax so no reason to fuss over a dagger)
---
Seems silly to give daggers to a DPS warrior when Rogues will obviously make better use of them for a longer time...
---
I wouldn't give daggers to any warrior until Rogues have theirs. The content is way too easy to need to give daggers to your tank right now... If they are having threat issues then your raid sucks
---
Yes they admitted that it was staged for entertainment purposes. They based it on dungeon runs they had, played up the comedy for effect and the rest is history.
---
I mean who the hell would calculate the odds of failure like that? ".333 recurring of course..."
---
What server/faction? Just started a new toon lastnight &amp; leveling (after being unsure which class I wanted to play and re-rolling 4x)
---
Also wanna know this
---
Imagine caring about topping dps meters in a game specifically designed so that certain hybrids don't top dps meters.
---
Lmfao Grob drama is spilling.
---
For those of you not in the know.
---
Step 1: Gank girl
---
Step 2: White Knights arrive
---
Was pretty sure that it didnt give healing, thanks a lot man!
---
There is a ret pally on my server with Hand of Rag.. why? Who knows..
---
Sounds like a tank without their shield equipped most likely.
---
Can you imagine the outrage if in Wotlk horde got death knights and alliance got wardens lmao
---
you just made a shaman jizz in their pants.
---
A big part of the problem is that paladins simply can't out-dps a mage. Where a warrior needs 2 swings, a paladin needs 6.
---
I recall one of the points being Korean men who played Horde couldn't convince their girlfriends to play with them because they'd have to play an ugly race.
---
And yeah, Blood Elves became the dominant Horde race pretty quickly, all things considered.
---
The things you’re saying are only true when you’re fighting a multiboxer that is also a massive noob. Even so, it’s abundantly clear that you are talking out of your ass.
---
Hear that rand?
---
Those are highly unfair, super short fights with recklessness and windfury. That 2.5k is an oddity. Still 1k can still be double of a Hand Of Rag paladin.
---
Dont you like spamming frostbolt though??
---
Some people like objects up their ass, whether it's a remote controller or your mom's dildo.
---
The reason is employee theft, not clever shenanigans in real world stores.   
---
But yeah, it does work on WoW for sure.
---
Bout to get that emerald cream
---
And it's easy enough to hold aggro when there's only one other part member drawing it, especially if the mage knows what he's doing.
---
I haven't run into this issue specifically, but I have run into a multitude of other issues with Z-Perl. It's target debuff timers do not work and it seems to have a failing interaction with OmniCC too. Not sure what can be done about it until the addon devs fix the issue themselves.
---
It was not a joke. It was a typo. No one is perfect. It happens. [And is now corrected.]
---
They won't aggro if you can fight them in the cave. That's what my jump runs have been doing and we never pull adds
---
Yeah; some more social/casual guilds still ran Vanilla raids when TBC was around.
---
You get close with aq40/naxx druid maces. Atiesh comes pretty close, but still nothing is as good as MCP.
---
Spamming AE when you have an enemy nearly dead or you're fighting multiple enemies at close range is...pretty common. 
---
For the record, since you're putting rotation in quotations (ha), a rotation is just a typical sequence of abilities used in different scenarios. It's not a roadmap you have to follow in every fight. AE is useful in a lot of situations, while you're waiting on cooldowns, if you're swarmed, if you're locked out of Frost, all that jazz. 
---
It's an excellent finisher if when your other instants aren't available and you need to take out just a few more slivers of HP.
---
Sometimes I wish a player would start something like this with me, I love talking shit when I'm in the right..
---
You got caught showing your ass son just walk away fake ass pvp mage
---
mounts are the same altho like mentionned bigger mounts can get you stuck , same way a taller character can get stuck ( as a night elf i hate spiral stairs ... i often get stuck near the opening at the top)
---
That being said  , one thing i havent seen mentionned yet, since you are talking about purchasing a mount from a different race , to be able to ride it you need to buy the training from that race which requires being exalted with the capital city of that race
---
For an amazonian warrior she's very, frail.
---
Yes! It was super fun. We had to develop actually new strategies as the retail ones just didn't work. It also felt great playing dps on there. A single dps death meant the boss is most likely a wipe. No slacking allowed!
---
Fuck that malygos implementation tho.
---
Nah r/yojamba
---
2 words for you. Mind Control
---
Demanding fights ? Are we playing the same game ?
---
Also dispel root &amp; slow on a 1 min cd
---
No but it was grass-fed
---
Why the hell would you give it to a Ret paladin? Seems like a massive waste of utility and resources.
---
I play on a small server and it can (and often does) take *forever* for anything to sell - a lot of the time it just won’t. 
---
I severely underprice a lot of my items quite significantly as I realised I was spending the difference on reposting my items so many times. I’d much rather just get a sale of some kind and move on with my day.
---
I am confused enough to laugh at your comment.
---
This would be Fairbanks. 
---
I played on OG Boulderfist and it was full of the worst people. 
---
Glad to see Fairbanks lives up to it!
---
Yeah, as a paladin I can confirm this. Bad* mages are a free kill. Good mages are untouchable
---
If you were following him that would imply he is in front which would mean he would get there first so there shouldn't be any ore for you.
---
Hahahah another 2 words: forced jump
---
Better ways to form groups. It's killing my motivation to play. I have friends/guild and I know the circlejerk around here but it's a pain. The frustration of finding people, running around just to try a dungeon is painful and feel like it's just too long for modern standard. After waisting so much time, it's just so hard to login and know you are not going to play for the next hour. I understand why retail has become the way it is. Maybe I am too accustomed to solo queue in virtually any other game but it feels like you play as much as you wait once you've reached a certain point in classic.
---
PVE wise anyway.
---
No. T2 helm and legs both have +dmg and heal, banana does not and only has +heal.
---
If you want to delete someone in a HoJ with SoC Judgement and DF Shock, you want the +dmg. The fact that it is on plate, and with high stam, is all to the better.
---
Literally just download auctionator and all your troubles are gone.
---
Nope, completely undocumented, but it was definitely halved.
---
[Do we create this environment, or does the environment instill it upon us?](https://youtu.be/3KquFZYi6L0)
---
I’ve been dual wielding since lvl 20 on my fury warrior and my preferred set up is one dagger one sword, although I’ve done both swords for the times I can’t find better daggers. Sword Main hand for bigger ability hits dagger off hand for faster attack speed and better rage generation!
---
&gt; But I believe it affects servers that have recently been ‘de-layered’. 
---
Nope, my server still has layers and we had our timer halved. Just an undocumented change.
---
*offers to shake hands *
---
I am going to take a more objective look at things:
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/statistics/1000#dataset=99&amp;aggregate=amount&amp;class=Paladin&amp;spec=Retribution
---
That is looking at the 99th percentile of Ret DPS. Max DPS was ~500 dps.
---
And now Prot warriors.
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/statistics/1000#dataset=99&amp;aggregate=amount&amp;class=Warrior&amp;spec=Protection
---
And overall:
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/statistics/1000#dataset=99&amp;aggregate=amount&amp;class=Any
---
(Tanks and healers included)
---
Doesn't paint a good picture.
---
I tanked it at 49 so yeah.
---
It really just sounds like you are bad at multiboxing if running behind you is enough to completely shut you down
---
Ony chain in burning steppes and Tirion questline @ 52  in EPL is the answer you’re looking for
---
Yikes, imagine being that scared of having to think on the fly vs other people in PvP that you project about yourself like that.
---
Mailboxes are always closer than the auctioneer.
---
Blood elves were really good as every class they had available, and looked good in armor. Dranaei, on the other hand...lol
---
Wouldnt be too worried with dps warriors, the tier is pretty trash for them. Just save those offset plate gloves, onslaught girdle, and weapons for them, theyll be happy with that.
---
tbh I really dont think it will work but I would say assuming it would you will have a lot of problems keeping threat especially if you are wearing gear with stats more geared for tanking so I would go human personally.
---
I am a fan of this idea myself. For example, horde paladins like Sunwalker Tauren or bloodknights could have re-textured spells and different names to fit the races lore but still function the same as a traditional human paladin
---
Ye I have thought about getting either an alt or starting to gold farm a bit
---
Axe spec while leveling.
---
Fury (or prot) while collecting gear and raiding
---
Sword spec for pvp.
---
It has nothing to do with layering. Even servers with 2 layers have had their devilsaur timer halved.
---
&gt;combat sword daggers
---
That's my guild! Not the super cool Marine Corps one, but Wholesome and Fun :D They're an awesome bunch of people and Danno is an awesome rogue &lt;3
---
says the guy whose wife would look better with a beard
---
He's no problem.
---
He wants the money faster than you and he will most likely get it. If someone isn't happy, buy and resell.
---
These paladin supremacy guys are an odd bunch.
---
Yeah. When an ally dies in my party I normally canabalize them while the healer is resurrecting them.
---
Spend time questing until 55 and then hit BRD, unless you’re a priest, it’s gonna be tough finding a group for BRD. 55 and below tend to pull aggro A LOT. If you do find groups it would be prob be with lower level players and clearing things can take a while. 
---
I quested until 55 and then tanked BRD until 60. Then got all my BiS after one UBRS run. As a tank id create my own groups and wouldn’t bring in anyone unless they were at least 55.
---
That same guys have been up there every night for a while for sure. I imagine the reports are stacking up against them pretty quick now.
---
Imagine being so tightly wound, that you threaten to waste your own time by reporting a guy for mining the same copper nodes. It must really suck to be that person.
---
Phase 2
---
You sir, are a masochist
---
I personally would say no to mh dagger, but yes to offhand. DW DPS warriors at this stage are basically rogue geared, so go as you please. Axes are more fun though =]
---
You’re not supposed to do your own haha
---
Looks like Warcraft adventures: lord of the clans
---
Yeah that would be neat but it would give terrible xp and they'd all be going for the same loot.
---
I started vanilla as a ret paladin, and it's one of those things I think back on and it hurts so much to think about the amount of pain and suffering it caused me.
---
This.  Even arena spam is good xp, and it’s only a couple pulls.
---
More aimed on the market price thingy.
---
It’s still better to see why you didn’t get it versus a hidden roll.
---
Lol I’m feral and we picked up two restos. We’ve been talking about splitting the raid groups since we are geared enough to handle it and they mentioned me going resto. I had to tell them I have no resto gear because my paerver experience taught me I’d just get funneled all the Druid T1 by default and I wasn’t expecting to be 3rd in line on all this healer shit.
---
I don’t think they needed to be faction locked but I would have liked more effort in keeping their class fantasies focused. I understand the lore mechanics behind why retail has Tauren and Zandalari paladins, for example, but their flavor seems to deviate too far from what Paladins were in WC3 and vanilla. Goblin shamans are a straight up joke, though; no idea how a notoriously fickle pantheon of nature demigods is fine with lending power to a environmentally indifferent race of hyper-capitalists. 
---
I was having this conversation with another user in a different forum, he suggested allowing class changes after extremely intensive quest chains, or maybe through other players; I don’t hate the idea, particularly because it makes exceptional race/class combinations feel exceptional
---
Warlock, 3 mages and a priest would be my vote. Easy spell cleave all the way to 60.
---
What are your professions? I was able to make my mount money from farming leather by following around groups in stv and dwm and skinning the dead mobs.
---
I always put stuff at x9.99. Unless x=6. Then I put it at 69.69.
---
It's weird. It wasn't even a personal attack on them. Hell... when I played a Rogue I just left Paladins alone for the most part and noped the fuck outta there. Even if I beat them it was just a very obnoxious fight. I am far more willing to engage a Paladin of any spec on my Mage.
---
If you have a field day against mages, you’re facing bad mages
---
Don't really get why anyone cares how much stuff is undercut by. If I'm putting something on the AH i just want it to sell quick and not have to bother with re-listing it down the line. A big undercut is the best way for me to do that.
---
Thanks for mentioning this. For a lot of people the fun in repeating these raids comes from clearing them faster and smoother. In the same vein that doing higher keys under timer in retail is fun. Its a challenge to fly through it. Trading furys for rets will inherently slow the raid down unfortunately, it’s just how it works.
---
I truly don't understand why everyone arguing for mages in this thread seem to speak as though BoF doesn't exist. Like are the paladins you guys are facing just not casting it for extended periods of time and letting you run away? Very strange.
---
Also no, paladin damage output was hurt quite a bit by TBC (in PvP, in comparison to what everyone else was capable of). Also mages had a way to dispel BoF, so that flipped the matchup on its head.
---
Granted but it dismounts you.
---
I mean its going to be pretty hard for a fury warrior, theyre one of most oversaturated classes going into Classic.
---
I can only assume he has had many discussions with people who are smarter than him.
---

Rotgrip @ Maraudon is easy enough for the next big upgrade.
---
fees; having to repost auctions eats into potential profit if you dont nail that sweet spot of sell vs profit
---
Anything can take 6 hours if you wipe 50 times. MC with no wipes and an average team is like 3 hours.
---
You have plenty of time. Maybe only about 10-15% of players are level capped.
---
For my journey to 60, the halfway point from a /played standpoint was ~42. Get guidelime and an appropriate guide for your faction, helped me a lot.
---
I’m lvl 32 with tailoring 115 and enchanting 95. Is it worth dropping these and picking up skinning and leather working? Tailoring and enchanting aren’t really making me any money right now and I haven’t been focusing on them too much. 
---
I’m at 23g and want to make sure I have enough gold for when I hit 40 for my mount. Or are there any other professions that can put some more money in my pocket? I’m fine with picking up tailoring and enchanting after I hit 40 again as I am in no rush to hit 60. Thanks.
---
That’s hilarious.
---
Side note: I’ve been spending too much time on WoW and this sub because I read “ally” as “allie” as in “Alliance player” and was confused for a second.
---
PSA: spirits at the end of Dire maul tribute don’t attack you and you can get weapon skill from them
---
Sure. Oddball numbers force employees to open the drawer in order to make change. Thus, the transaction has to go through the cash register and be traceable, instead of you just handing the guy a twenty, which he maybe puts into his pocket.
---
Honestly, nobody has everything memorized perfectly from over a decade ago. I raided a lot of stuff, including Naxx. Didn't ever R14, though, because I had a job, and dear god that was a grind. 
---
But just because you were in a raid guild back in the day doesn't mean you know everything now. Shit, a lot of people largely just followed along with whatever the raid leader said to do. And most of THOSE people got their strats from the cutting edge guilds. Just like people do today. It isn't all that different.
---
That's not how it works. The animations have no actual bearing on gameplay in almost all cases. It was a bug during TBC, that did *not* exist that long, and certainly doesn't exist now.
---
I like them, as long as they know their place and pass on loot to the useful classes..
---
Unfortunately, on PVP servers, unless they are using an exploit that is verifiable, nothing will happen. Camping a person isn’t against the TOS. 
---
Now if the victim is being harassed verbally then screenshots will go a long way to Blizz taking action
---
I value my time alot and that's why i undercut without a second thought. If you feel like you are busting your ass to farm you don't care about your own time.. If you're having fun it doesn't matter to you as much. I also think it makes it easier for people to get stuff so you're saving people time &amp; money. I'd rather mates in the faction have better things so that it would make everything else overall better.
---
Yeah not a fan of people that undercut by such a large amount either. 1c would have been just fine.
---
&gt; Specific spell bonus (Ie + Frost) doesn't follow the 3 second rule where generic spell damage does. Frost bolts spell coefficient is around 80.
---
&gt; Meaning + damage from a green is around 20% better than generic spell power.
---
Can you please elaborate on this? What is the 3 second rule? Are you saying that +10 Frost Damage is better than +10 Spell Damage for Frostbolt?
---
Warriors are an oddity, for raiding specs you have fury/ arms and fury/prot. Both of which do more DPS then ret.
---
I feel sorry for your job, you use WAY too many commas, your writing style is terrible.
---
Thats a full time job though.
---
Honestly I don’t think this is dumb at all. Playing the market takes time and mental energy- two things that could be used for more grinding, which results in more g...
---
There really isn’t anything wrong with saying ‘I’m fine with only getting x amount out of this because the savings on my time and mind is worth the cost’.
---
I've got someone in my guild that claims to have been rank 14 and cleared naxx, I don't believe it for a second.
---
It's suuuuch good XP. I ran it with my fellow warrior tank friend as well as my resto druid friend and me as an arms dps warrior and often just defaulted to being the off tank for the non-elite mobs because my aoe was extreme.
---
We honestly had a blast, we were all micced up on discord and I had the wowhead strategy guide for the instance open in my second monitor, and we honed in our mastery of that instance to the point we could clear it in our sleep in about 1.75 hours flat, and the mood/tone of the dungeon is so much more enjoyable to me than that of BRM.
---
Pfft, amateur hour.  My guild will hate me for telling everyone but the truth needs to be known.  Here’s my 30K/hr farming technique:
---
1.  30 seconds after login, kill something that drops a BOE that sells on the AH for 250 gold.
---
2.  At this rate, after an hour you will have 30K gold.
---
Log this in the issues section on curseforge.
---
I mean, I enjoy WoW, but it's just a game. I often don't have the time to optimize my listings, especially since I'm not always on during some of the best times to sell. Like you, I'm often happy to just undercut, getting the sale out of the way, especially since I already have my epic mount.
---
Huh? Do you not know about imp counterspell? I don't know if you are a troll now or if you have never fought a Mage that was running with anything else but his raid spec.
---
The reason you roll troll has nothing to do with stats. They are simply the indisputably best race.
---
I was in a raid with a guild called Chilladis or something like that. They claimed it was +1 rolls on loot. First peices of rogue tier gear was given to a guildie with no rolls.
---
They claimed to have experience in Naxx too...
---
Three is necessary if you’re AOE farming maybe not as necessary for end game but on 3/3 enemies remain in your blizzard for the entire duration.
---
Between zero and read-the-post.
---
I was actually in a Naxx clearing guild back in Vanilla.  Its kinda cool to see how much raiding's evolved over the years.  We raided a lot for the time but compared to the prep/hours guilds like Method put in these days we were basically casuals.  R14 was a whole different animal though.  I got up to rank 12 grinding AB for like 10 hours a day but 13/14 needed literally 24/7 playtime for weeks on end -_-.  Pretty much guaranteed people who say they were rank 14 are bullshitting.
---
Its all fun and games til someone gets murdered
---
We did two full quest runs of BRD (some quests are easier to do in separate parts) at around 56. Definitely worth it, at least to us, to wait until then.
---
Get a healer leveling buddy. It will be cake then. I leveled 1-60 with a priest. We instantly got groups and plowed through quests. The biggest thing is chasing good weapons as you level. It makes a massive difference.
---
Even a moderately competent multiboxer knows how to set up a keybinding that will face all of their slaves to their target. You can even have it so melee constantly spam interact with target+click to move along with their abilities to always move towards their target.
---
Well the jerk store called....
---
AND THEY'RE ALL OUT OF YOU!
---
Great to hear guys, we'll be running for a few levels for sure, thanks for the comments!
---
You have BoF for 50% of the time, 100% of that time you'd be in a sheep, and then after that you just die. Blink the HoJ = no stun. At low levels at least, Pallies are free kills.
---
I do. The fights usually last long enough to get a few snares in. Again... this is only creating distance. Usually my slows on a Paladin aren't coming from my frost nova. I assume my frost nova is rarely going to stop a pally.
---
I am a holy priest with 4 ragnaros kills so far. Epic mount? He'll no I have literally -5 gold. 5 gold to go and I paid my depts. I didn't even borrow much just for a few essences for my hide of the wild.
---
Level first aid
---
Imagine getting upset about competing w 2 ppl for loot.
---
That entitlement.
---
Is 40 warrior good to tank ULD?
---
I’m so confused. Two different weapons have two different statements about what they do. The point of the post was to ask what made them different—if anything—other than the numbers.
---
Edit: FYI the two weapons I’m comparing are Magician Staff of Healing and Death Speaker Scepter.
---
Edit 2: To clarify my question, why does the +24 healing staff just say “+24” not “up to 24,” and why does the scepter say “up to 11” and not “+11”?
---
The higher the mount the less likely you are to get dismounted when crossing a river.
---
They're saying you can remove his cut &amp; earn more by downloading the addons and doing a 30 seconds scan occasionally.
---
Obviously mailboxes are easier but some people don't realize that these addons are "playing the market" for you and it's really not a skill that is required.
---
Ret paladin, she, and officer.
---
Gooood times.
---
Good to know. I will banish to be helpful
---
I do the same thing as you, I undercut hardcore AH sellers by 20-40 Silver so my shit sells quicker. I ain't got time to maximize my profit, if I'm getting more than what the vendor will give me then I'm good. 
---
Its not like its real money...
---
No it is not. It is in the border between Searing Gorge and Dun Morogh, you fly over it on gryohon rides.
---
I do the same with skins. If they linger, I wait so I don't steal their shit. If they bail, it's my shit.
---
Yeah I’ve played the game on and off since 2006 but I’m not super familiar with the lore, but aren’t blood elf paladins not really “holy” paladins? Like they are abusing holy magic not actually righteous warriors. If this is the case they should of retextured the spells more seal of blood vs seal of sacrifice is the only difference that comes to mind.
---
Yeah honestly showing up with the right consumables and world buffs gives you more of an edge than a single piece of loot.
---
I did this in green items from week 2 ?
---
Yeah I obviously took that into consideration!
---
At what level can I pick up the Ony attune quest as horde? I keep being told 55, but the dude in Kargath ain’t giving me nothing.
---
Am Tauren and for me it was uc too, but I read that you can also get it in ratchet(?)
---
&gt; memes about one of the two tank classes being worthless
---
&gt; 5 mins later: why are there no tanks for five mans??
---
Its pretty wild that the belief in og vanilla was that druid = healer and the itemization reflects that... whereas in classic bear seems to be considered the optimal druid spec. 
---
Props to the pserver druids who made this possible. Taladril's guide in particular is one of the cornerstones of bear tanking.
---
Tbh tho - i leveled a druid because i wanna flag run. Tanking raids and 5 mans is a way to fill the hours until the pvp begins.
---
Cool
---
No weeb shit here.
---
There was a period in early BC where this was true, but I think it was a bug introduced in 2.0?  Not sure.
---
Agreed.
---
Feral is widely know to be good tanks. This is mainly a oomkin, ret, ench issue.
---
Me too i would spend way too much time just prowling around bopping horde for shits and giggles
---
Just know that the last boss can be a bit of a beating. He will put you to sleep and start wailing on the dps.
---
Even at 48 you can be doing princess Mara runs for a BiS ring. Once you really get into brass you can just dungeon grind for gear and forget about leveling
---
I smuggle items through the neutral AH between my accounts nearly every day. I actually got caught in an auto bad for sending too much gold through it but after they looked through the logs it got overturned. 
---
Aka, not against the rules.
---
ayyy whattaya gonna do 'bout it
---
It takes an hour and a half to clear.... with pretty average people.
---
Get used to it
---
Except if he's a rogue.
---
Well no, you see, it depends on what you mean by progressing, and what you mean by punishable offense. What if I say no?
---
Stand max melee range. No idea why all melee feel the need to be right up on everything. On onyxia you can stand in the ranged and still hit her.
---
The point of this post is "everyone claims they were a rank 14 PvPer who cleared Naxx"
---
The context of "well, they COULD have if they had time" doesn't fucking matter. That's not the goddamn point being discussed.
---
These are the same people who say "we don't need a raid of full 60s, we can go in at 55 in greens and 20 man it" and then go in and wipe on Lucifron for 2 hours.
---
That's 24k people across US and EU. There's more than 30 servers between the USA and EU you know. Doing "3 bosses in Naxx" is not the equivalent to clearing it. Guilds who barely got their feet wet in AQ40 were able to do that.
---
There's a guy in this very thread who claims his "friend got to rank 14 in 3 weeks"
---
People are horrible liars
---
Ya, it's the difference between folks who love playing auctions on eBay, versus people who just use eBay to make whatever money on items they no longer need/want (sort of like a virtual garage sale).
---
Making an alliance alt as a horde character to communicate with a player of the opposite faction that you had a negative encounter with... I'm pretty sure you can't even make an opposite faction character on a PvP server without having a second account. 
---
Using the alliance alt to track the players zone through /who threatening and targeting that specific player isn't harrasment? 
---
Either you're using hardcore wrong or you're using harrasment wrong.
---
are you eating other people lunches?! ...well stop it!
---
Because they don’t know our hpm efficiencies. At my gear level, a non-talented rejuvenation has only ***marginally*** higher hpm than rank 4 (I think) Healing Touch spam, and Regrowth’s HPM is just ***awful.***
---
What I’m finding is that Moonglow spec and rank 6+ Healing Touch is what’s most efficient for me. This means that spirit is a very poor stat for me, and I’ve been focusing on Int and Mp5. This makes my priests happy because I’m not a good Innervate target.
---
I plan on trying a moonglow/imp rejuv build with high spirit. The rotation is going to revolve around timing high-rank Healing Touches to land right when rejuv needs refreshed. That way I’ll pack two spell casts into one instance of idle-regen break, and so only incur 5 seconds of of casting-regen every 12 seconds. This will get me 3 ticks of full spirit regen between rejuvs. At 200 spirit, that’s about 160 mana (about half the cost of rejuv).
---
Must speak the password to proceed!
---
Go to frickin’ heck, ya juice box thief!
---
Yes I know, it's referred to as the Ironforge Airfield/airport  
---
 [https://wow.gamepedia.com/Ironforge\_Airfield](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Ironforge_Airfield)
---
I don’t think you’re correct.
---
It doesn't matter in the subject of *this discussion*
---
This discussion is calling out people who lied and claimed they were Naxx raiders. Everything else is irrelevant.
---
Actually I rarely die in ganks because most horde are smart enough to not fight a paladin. It's a waste if time lol. Its up because no one engages me lol
---
Ive never played wow and had it be a ghost town. Especially in classic, all the zones are populated. Hop on in!
---
Make sure to research servers a bit.
---
So what's your plan for the ice block during your bubble?
---
I like to sneak 73 into my auctions as often as possible. So pretty much 90% of my auctions have 73s or 73c
---
That depends on state and locality. Even in the US, some states have no sales tax.
---
Go with honor, fellow paladin
---
The real AH players would never msg you like this, they instantly buy everything undercut and resell more to set the market price than to even flip a small margin.
---
[this guy would like to have a word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORL-CpNVFzc)
---
I’ll tell you who it was, it was that damned Sasquatch
---
Meanwhile my class leader has no raid gear yet because he wants us to all be geared first
---
Honestly WoW is more about being a true RP game than being perfectly balanced. And what you're saying makes no sense anyway. Both factions don't need the same available classes for WoW to be a balanced game.
---
You know downvote doesn't exist for this purpose ? Keep your feelingcraft for you.
---
Lol the fuck is wrong with these people
---
My server is pretty high pop. I still see people spamming LFG for deadmines and stocks pretty regularly. Also, there's still enough people knocking around Westfall to annoy my level 15 alt.
---
So, not too late.
---
I did enchanting and tailoring as a mage, I would have had so much for gold if I didn't level them at the same time. That being said I got my 60% mount at 40 and 100% a day after i dinged 60 cause aoe farming is op
---
Yes a gathering skill is going to make you heaps more money than skilling up enchanting. Even if you just sell the herbs/ore/leather
---
Good thing your opinion isn't at all relevant. All TSM does is can for new auctions with a certain criteria. Getting a snipe like this as rare as you posting it, sorry you are on the other end of the luck. Pays to double check, now you will next time, mate.
---
Lol, botting.
---
You ain't factoring in my goblin rocket helmet and grenades brother
---
I believe stone fist, that drops in mara(giant boss), is the absolute best item in the game for mana problem as paladin tank. Reasoning behind this is, chance to get 50 mana back on hit, wich is nice.. About as muchas a Rank 2 JoW proc. Sad thing is it doesn't happen enough so you can stop using wisdom seal/judgement. The real strength of the item is the fast attackspeed. The attackspeed opens up more wisdom procs and gives me as a 54 prot paladin almost no mana issues. 
---
With the surplus of mana I am able to do 6-8 mob pulls in sorrow hill (wpl) spamming conc and holy shield and going oom first as the mobs die. 
---
And fiery weapon makes for a good enchant on it if you have some spare money.
---
Herbalism/mining; just cycle the node search function every so often so you’ll find them both
---
Casual guilds that are struggling have warriors rogues and mages doing less damage than ret paladins. Comparing top logs to casual guilds is nonsense. 
---
Any player that’s going to put effort in, farm their preraid bis and is enjoyable to socialize with is valuable to those guilds regardless of class. Some of those guilds try to pretend they’re apes though with their fury warriors all 300 or lower dps. Those guilds issue isn’t ret pallies, boomies or spriests.
---
very yes
---
Makes sense tho hits my altoholism in the right places
---
Imp thorns seems pretty negligible in raid. It's pretty nice for dungeons but definitely don't need it in raids.
---
U realize the item sitting in your bags is still worth money right?  Like selling it today or selling it tomorrow doesn't depreciate the value?   The only thing depreciating the value is you people thinking you're making an intelligent move by undercutting by 50%.   Honestly this is the last message I'm responding to in this post. It's exhausting dealing with simpletons
---
Human for swords. 1% dodge isn’t going to help that much. Stack stam and have a teeth geared healer. 
---
Either way you won’t be able to hold threat on more than 1 target when your AOE cooldowns are down and that target when it does hit you will do massive damage. Even with the best bear tanking gear in the game you won’t be able to live through most end game bosses. Forget raid bosses. One crushing crit or two hits back to back and you are toast. 
---
I’ve had rogues evasion tank Rag for a few seconds while we Rez the tank or whatever but you would need a team of healers bombing heals on you to not die after evasion drops. Like dedicated healers just OOMing every fight. 
---
Not saying you “can’t” just saying it’s crazy and I wanna see videos.
---
Please tell me this was on the server Sulfuras? I tanked the fuck outa thrall after the alliance crafted the server first Sulfuras, then the joint alliance proceeded to smash Orgrimmar. To sadly fall at the elevators or thunder bluff.
---
The sleep is non-dispellable too right? Being a priest he cooooouuld be undead which would certainly help &gt;.&gt;
---
paladin gameplay. neat.
---
Note that I have not criticized anyone's writing. I haven't even said anyone *should* write properly. I've only pointed out that it is sad that some people criticize someone for trying to write properly. Do you disagree with me on this? Do you think you should criticize someone for trying to write properly?
---
I will agree that, in general, what is considered "proper" can be subjective. It can depend on the situation. But I'm not the one who first brought that word into this thread. The only opinion I've "pushed" -- actually, only presented as my opinion -- is that it is sad to criticize someone for trying to write properly. Again, do you think it is right to criticize someone for trying to write properly? You think trying to write properly (even in a game chat) is wrong or bad?
---
And starting sentences with a conjunction is not "terrible." But you should probably write in the style that your teacher or professor (or boss) wants you to write in. Writing style should be directed towards the expected reading (or grading) audience.
---
Edit: I'm currently a technical writer, so how I write in my job is nothing at all like how I write on this forum (or in game chat).
---
I had this exact thing happen with the BFA beta, it would only run on the intel cpu for some reason, and I got tons of heat related artifacts.  So while you could be correct for some cases, you aren't correct in all cases.
---
Holy fuck Jordan Peterson plays wow?
---
Any classes are viable. With a +100 hp to chest you're a raid boss (to the questers). First aid is most important profession.
---
It's amazing that people are paying so much for those Blasted Lands consumes.
---
You wont be getting into strat, scholo and DM until at least 58
---
I personally think it was okay since it was being reused. It introduced far more complex mechanics to people who may have never encountered them. It also made them a bit more forgiving, so everyone could get used to them. ICC had a lot of mechanics that would have been right at home in Naxx, so it made it far less jarring.
---
“Bucko” 😂😂😂😂😂
---
It’s okay with herbalism if you can’t really farm much else. I do it as arcane since I don’t want to respecc everytime I go to farm gold.
---
complaining about pvp happening to you when you're flagged or on a pvp server is the second most idiotic thing to post... the first most is complaining about a healer not flagging up to join you in being ganked when you're doubly stupid that you show up someplace opposite faction members can be expected to be while flagged on a non-pvp realm.
---
It is a good suggestion, gear is easy to get, this can be done in dungeon blues and its something to work towards. If someone has mining its a guaranteed arcane crystal from the nodes at the end which on my server its 50-60 just for that.
---
This describes Fairbanks perfectly. So tired of 10 on 1 battles its ridiculous. They need to fix the imbalance.
---
If you dont think Stoneform is the best racial, or Paladins especially with Mage/Warrior synergy are wayyyyy better than shamans, I've got news for you.
---
Also Dwarf priests give your whole premade Will of the Forsaken before a BG/fight even begins.
---
Undercutting by 1c: get undercut by 1c four minutes later
---
Undercutting by 40s: other undercutters wait for the price to go back up or they buy your stock and relist.
---
Not trying, im different person that the one you had long conversation, but I asked you about AE because you said that using AE in pvp is stupid. No it's not, you don't aoe the whole time like an idiot but you need AE in your pvp spells rotation. If you think you don't then you the one who is in wrong.
---
They can, but it makes it more challenging. 
---
This reason is the historical reason, whereas psychological pricing is a more modern rationale. Sure, you can do it for that reason now, but it's not the reason it started. Nowadays, we mostly use credit cards, so the ol' cash policies matter less(and don't matter at all for WoW),
---
You can tell because your face first in the dirt coward.
---
Tauren Druids, duh
---
Suprised the other horde didn't start attacking you.
---
Combat daggers beats swords.
---
I mean bre remains bis for cleave fights till naxx for 2h fury
---
and flameguard is our current bis over devilsaur when we get band of accuria
---
if your guild is funneling them to you then good for you but the warriors should all quit since they are getting shafted on loot, esp for bre since it's just that damned good with the armor shread even without wf in alliance on cleave fights
---
What an insecure bitch. Even blocks you lmao. Hate to see how he handles real life.
---
How did the offtanking go?
---
What loss of time? If I wasn’t playing this I would just be playing another game. At least I enjoy this one.
---
As far as I know. It's a really funky spell that doesn't seem to act like normal incapacitate effects. Like tremor totem doesn't work but WoTF does or something? I dunno, it just always makes the fight mind of a cluster.
---
what a noob lol
---
I make a post mocking people who claim they raided naxx to gain credibility, then a bunch of people claim they raided naxx to get credibility on their opinions.
---
Everyone was a naxx raider apparently. Just don't ask them their character names, guilds or servers. They *forgot*.
---
How did it go?!
---
Not in this phase.
---
This brings a new meaning to eat the booty like groceries.
---
Fury warriors fall under the 1 of 10+ of the same class clause I mentioned. So do mages.
---
But if a warlock/druid/paladin is going a month without loot, something is fishy. (Of course, it might not be bis loot, they might be getting their crappy t1 or heal mace, but loot is loot in terms of this discussion.)
---
Isn't that one of the rarest items in classic?
---
R Kelley can't read man, cut him some slack lol
---
What is MS&gt;OS?
---
She does some mega fucky stuff sometimes I've seen. I pulled aggro in phase 1 like 1s before the transition and she turned around and smacked me once. I was 25k threat under both tanks, and below several DPS. She then proceeded to hit me with 3 fireballs in a row which like...yeah nothing we can do about that. No one was next to me but it was fucking weird. 
---
We have everyone burn vanish, fade, etc the moment she touches the floor, and it seems to work well for P3 though. The P3 transition is always a bit nerve wracking though.
---
Let your OT know he has your support. Often times people don't make moves out of fear of backlash. Which is entirely plausible, but the more that are on his side the better.
---
I think you do. He sounds like someone who has never been on the receiving end of the Horde on a PvP server. It's fucking ridiculous.
---
Run it till like 53-54 then do arena/prison runs
---
[Found it!](https://i.imgur.com/e8OQznz.jpg)
---
Great news!  Thanks!
---
Word of advice: don’t refer to anyone as Bucko, ever.
---
Stoneform is the best PvP racial, Paladins are infinitely better than shamans, Dwarf Priests can fear ward 20 players before the duration is up.
---
They have added new realms.. and even some servers that didn't have a queue time have them a little bit.   Numbers are hardly dropping off.   
---
If the game is fun its worth your time, simple as that.  Being a responsible adult comes with Balancing your priorities.  I work full time and play just fine.. Hell i still even get my cardio done each day.  I might not be lvl 60 yet (50 atm) but i am having fun and enjoying the leveling process, meeting people and seeing them progress as well.
---
ughhhh ive weighed this heavily, basically because my main is on rattlegore and has loads of gold to finance this all. otherwise yea i would do this on an RP server
---
That's westfall
---
Why is that? I leveled Shadow on Herod and had a blast.
---
Freaking Uldaman. I basically always take a wrong turn in the tunnels. A lot of the other stuff is muscle memory somehow, but that dungeon...god.
---
That does it "Bucko"!
---
"Bucko"
---
"other people roll on some of them" 
---
All of them you mean. That belt is BIS for wlocks, rings, trinket and amulet are BIS for any caster. Eye of Divinity is our only "own" loot and even that goes to healers first. Ive seen priest join my guild and raids at lvl 57 while i was already 60 have better gear than me, because they are healer or they can actually roll on their sets.
---
The rotation and all that is pretty cool no doubt, just passing on 95% of the loot is the depressing part :D
---
...so, uh, why did you ignore him?
---
Is that Karen?
---

Airfield is the area in Dun Morogh bordering both Loch Modan and Wetlands--the Northeasternish portion of Dun Morogh. Searing Gorge is south of Dun Morogh. This area isnt quite the same as the Airfield

Why are people so obsessed with how much someone sells their shit for? I've seen so many posts about this exact thing and it blows my fucking mind.

Imma sell my shit for however much I want. Especially when I'm a poorass level 15 and just need a few silver quickly for my skills.

I did raid Naxxarmas on my paladin back in vanilla. My guild cleared the spider, plague, and zombie wing, but were stuck on the four horsemen. I don't remember anything other than constantly refreshing blessings and spamming flash of light into the lowest health member prompted to me with the heal bot addon.
---
Did I miss anything?
---
I’m not a healer nor do I know of a specific addon. However you could look up your spell power coefficients of your class and see exactly how much you’re receiving on top of your heals.
---
There is literally no need to funnel loot to MT in current raid content, unless your MT is some fress 60 or got extremely unlucky in dungeons.
---
You can tank any 5man dungeon as any spec. However it will get increasingly more difficult when you get to strat, scholo and blackrock spire. I've tanked all of them as prot, fury prot hybrid and full fury. What I will say is that I no longer wish to tank anything as full fury because it's just very annoying trying to hold aggro, as I tend to eun out of rage even when doing my best to pool it. The biggest impact talents in prot are luckily easily reachable. Improved shield block, extra threat in defensive stance and reduced rage cost of sunder armor really made tanking so much easier. 
---
As for your questions, you can probably get into strat and scholo at 59 if you're prot, although they won't be easy. If you've never ran them previously, I'd wait until 60.

I wouldn't take a 52 for a full emperor run, but it's probably fine for earlier stuff. Jail, arena, probably anger/golem. BRD is huge.
---
Our loot council was run heavily by the GM who gives his lvl 55 gf all the healing loot she needs and himself all the tanking loot and then lets the rest of the LC pick it clean as a reward.
---
I tell people with all truth. 
---
I played vanilla, I was a Huntard, my biggest accomplishment was getting Rkohdelar when naxx was current content. 
---
I did see inside AQ 40 once, when I was watching my friend play his account and he was raiding Twin Emps.
---
None of the classes in classic are whack-a-mole like retail classes are, with 5-10 buttons that the game tells you to hit in a certain order.
---
Hunter is a pretty wild example to use here, man. I have mained hunters in vanilla for years now. Raid DPS does require* you to watch your autoshot timer (*depending on your wep speed), but it's generally just sit back and multishot on CD and aimed shot after an auto. It's very laid-back, no spamming or GCD-bottlenecking to be found. Outside of raids you're literally better off NOT using abilities and just grinding with autoshot to save mana for PVP or add pulls. It's actually one of the main reasons I play hunter, because it is literally the chillest shit, almost exactly the same as paladin. Retail doesn't have anything like that any more. At every level you are SPAMMING abilities all the time, it's pointless and boring.
---
People like this are the most annoying kind of person in WoW.

It seems as if you ran into advertise on his alt. lmao

Yes but by killing the lead character, you kill the entire basis from which their entire group forms their formation?  Is that false or is there something else I'm missing?  I've always thought it did but perhaps someone can correct me.

This includes all the Blasted Lands mobs. This 'nerf' happened in the 1.11 patch so it is not surprising it made it into classic.

My favorite at the time was kiting [Grol the Destroyer](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=7665/grol-the-destroyer#comments). More fun than the normal servants because he hits like a goddamn freight train and often cleaved for ~1k in front of him.

I quit the game soon after Blizzard handed the C'thun world first to EU/when I finished r14 so I don't think I played with your friend. I think the only Pally I played with that had a X in his name was Demontx. And the only person I played with whose name started with an X was Xi the warrior.

Does anyone know exactly how 'seal of ascension' emberstrife UBRS key quest works? From what I understand only 1 person can create the seal at a time but afterwards his ability has a 3 hour cooldown. Does this cooldown reset after you kill the dragon or do you have to wait 3 hours either way?
---

---
That was deep.
---
You're right lol.  Getting too caught up with this
---
I think priest is viable, if you bring all the consumables etc. But you do have a lot of jobs to do other than DPS on certain bosses, dispells etc. I love the class, but having passed on 20+ Tier 1 pieces is soul crushing :D
---
Someone /spit on me yesterday for getting to an herb before them.

\*a boss fight where melee dps are encouraged to stop dpsing after \~3 stacks of raid debuffs. and tanks are encouraged to trade off after \~5 stacks of raid debuffs\*= "a pretty standard fight."
---
Mostly T1 and hypnotic flame gloves, and two stat rings that nobody uses for pve anyway. That is besides the stuff that you'd normally want as pve shadow, which amounts to a grand total of 5 items (neck, ring, belt, staff, trinket).
---
You need grounding totem. Or have an OT when the MT sleeps. Shaman is really good in ST with grounding and tremor for the fears
---
There was an issue with that cpu that may not have been major enough to kill it. If it was heat related artifacts specifically I'd argue your heatsink wasn't properly mounted.
---
LW for sure. I've crafted 16 slot ammo bags. the only better pre-BIS ammo/quiver bag comes from ribbly in BRD and it's just 1% more atk speed
---
edit: the 16 slot bags are lv40
---
You didn't do anything to disprove it.
---
Who would bother doing that for copper
---
Can someone expand on this for me, please? It sounds like there is an addon that will auto-scan the AH for under-priced items and auto-buy them. Is that correct? I see from other comments that you have to be in front of your monitor to make this happen, but how much involvement is there really?
---
Edit: To clarify further, I've got a bank alt that I will spend plenty of spare time on just perusing the AH and would love anything to make that easier for me. I already have auctioneer.
---
Bin playing ally pally but just switched to Horde and new server to join people from work.
---
For example: Nightslayer Boots are put up for bid for 100 DKP, all the Rogues that want it !bid, whoever has the highest DKP gets it.
---
This reminds me of a very trolly mage on Nost who would follow me around when I was herbing and whenever I found a herb we would both dive for it, but he would pop his Mind Quickening Gem which speeds up his cast time and always herb it before me.
---
It's hard in that an unexpected second mob will result in death 30-50% of time assuming equal level.

is this samurai champloo?
---
Yeah if you're selling a hot, high-volume item (like say a stack of leather or cloth) then it makes sense just to undercut by 1c. There's a very good chance people will end up buying it before you get undercut too many times.
---
However, more rare farming items or things like gear it can be smart to undercut by a large margin if you know the price is out of whack or the item sells slowly.
---
If I'm trying to sell a piece of leather gear that gets bought, but not very often, then chances are if I only undercut by 1c another seller is going to undercut me before someone buys it and they'll end up buying theirs instead. If I undercut by a lot it is more likely to sell for a number of reasons:
---
1. Buyer will think mine is a "deal" just because it's so much cheaper than the rest
---
2. Another seller might try to flip mine
---
3. Other sellers might see how low mine is and actually price above it hoping that once mine sells theirs is next.
---
Either way it means you have a much higher chance of selling.
---
&gt; No one wants to carry you through a raid.
---
Im glad you are wrong on this point, currently raiding with a casual guild as an oomkin.
---
Tryharding in Classic is like taking steroids to win the middle school paralympics.
---
"learn how to econ nerd"  
---
As an econ major in college this made me crack up.

60 for a tank, 58 for dps, a healer _might_ be able to talk their guild into letting them run some of those at 55.
---
Bye Felicia.
---
I wouldn't. Idk about you but as a mage more than two pieces out of mc will be bis for me for 3 or more phases. 
---
This is not bfa, they're not going to stop clearing mc weekly because a new raid tier comes out.
---
you get creeps like this sometime, which just take each case as it comes up. its just part of job.
---
Finish southern barrens/Camp t. Stonetalon. 1k needles or if that's too hard I think ashenvale.
---
&gt;This is absolutely false. Ret paladins still bring blessings, and are more often specced into Kings for raiding purposes than are holy paladins.
---
No sorry, if you dont have a pally in the raid already specced into kings Idk what to tell you. 
---
&gt;They also keep judgement of light on enemies, which helps to keep the melee topped off.
---
Looking at logs this healing is incredibly negligible to the point it doesn't matter. 
---
&gt;Thy can also help cleanse to save GCDs for other casters.
---
So something a normal pally can do?
---
&gt;Are these things necessary? Absolutely not, but they are unique utility that at least provides some sort of support. Ret paladins are decidedly above enh/ele shamans and boomkins in what they are able to do in raids in vanilla. All of them are completely expendable.
---
None of the things you listed are anywhere near the enh shaman totem twisting for increased crit/agi for melee group with improved totems, ele shaman just providing base totems, or even the tiny tiny amount of spell crit boomies give. 
---
Ret pallies utility is not even in the same ballpark as the others in anyway.
---
Jordan Peterson is such a psyop.
---
100% agree, sucks that it comes down to stuff like this.
---
Currently 54 and competing with mages for sorrow hill. Only 36 spelldmg as of now, but I have thorium spike on ST shield and Cloak of Fire that drop of pyro outside BRD. 2 min cd extra aoe dmg. Really looking forward to Skullflame when I get lucky or find a seller! 
---
Hard to get plate with spell damage pre 60, there is some in brd but many stingey looks when the pala goes for spelldamage items. Honestly the hardest part of being prot paladin is convincing ppl to let you get the gear you need.
---
Deep, or right or wrong? And why?
---
Time for you to get deep.  I'm waiting.
---
&gt; "Tanks aren't shifting for free rage"
---
This doesn't make sense. I would for sure.
---
If this is a thing that works then color me wanting to do the same. A bit of faerlina hold for sulfaras gold
---
I know a lot of the boys from Nazgul, I wonder if anyone was around for this coz this is funny as fuck
---
Its a 2handed mace?? What class wants that, for pve, besides ret pala or enh shaman? A arms warrior for pvp perhaps..
---
Makes sense. Is their a specific reason why they didn’t have warriors at launch? I get that they are mana hungry and warriors don’t use mana but they did have rogues. Was it just a balancing issue? No human/undead hunters is also pretty strange.
---
Someone mind control them!
---
Pay real money to make fake money. Really don't get it.
---
Or possibly that Cata is the expansion that made the game better.
---
The 3 second rule is:
---
On cast spells each spell has a spell power coefficient approximately equal to (cast time)/3. Meaning that a maxed rank Frost bolt has a 2.5/3 or ~ .80 spell power coefficient.
---
Spell power on gear is only 80% effective for Frost bolt. 
---
But. 
---
For items that have specific + Frost damage the spell power coefficient is ignored.
---
So: +10 SP for damage and healing would give +8 sp.
---
But a +10 SP from a "of frozen wrath" would give +10.
---
I’ve never had my stuff sniped, I’ve just manually used AH for years. I personally just think it gets rid of the whole “economy by the people” and manual skills people could develop without using 3rd party resources.
---
&gt; This includes all the Blasted Lands mobs. This 'nerf' happened in the 1.11 patch so it is not surprising it made it into classic.
---
I am fairly sure the 1.11 patch only applied to Kazzak because I remember vividly pulling Teremus the Devourer to Stormwind near the end of Vanilla. That same mob is pulled to Stormwind frequently in Classic.
---
Also there are other posters here claiming to have pulled the servants during TBC and Wrath.
---
Not if you have a shaman that keeps up grounding totem. Makes the fight easy mode for horde.
---
Oof imagine giving a BRE to a ret over a dps warrior.  That one would sting
---
To play devil's advocate, I have contacted guild masters when one of their members ninjas or does something else despicable. If the GM defends what the player did, then I blacklist the guild to avoid that type of behavior in the future. Not looking for punishment, just to make more informed decisions when pugging.
---
First time I see Westfall on this sub and it's about toxicity.  I've encountered very few negative people on the realm.
---
I did this on my Goblin Death Knight to some Tauren leveling in Durotar. For no reason, I just felt like messing with someone in a harmless way. They indeed got upset.
---
Pretty much. Anyone actually who complains about undercutting has a great ignorance on the topic.
---
If you are not 100% sure that you can buy out all undercut goods and resell, then that means the current price is to high for the existing supply.
---
People who complain about undercutting usually fall in two camps. Either they lack understanding of game economy to know they can just buy out cheaper items, or second they knowingly are selling item above market price and get made at people who ruin it for them, knowing if they buy out all the cheaper items they wont sell.
---
Criminally underrated comment, have an upvote
---
If you’re curious about group composition:
---
The best 3 party members are shaman, mage, and rogue. Shaman drops windfury totem, mage counterspell assists pulling + sheep + aoe, and rogue kills casters who are your greatest threat and gets locked chests. Next priest and other warriors are good to bring as they have high utility and dps/hps output. Last come less useful warlocks and least useful hunters. Warlocks are weak because they have no threat management and limited in combat utility and hunters will wipe your group then feign death.
---
? Healing me full and start again? And heal my team mates if I don't need to heal myself
---
It might be a better idea to do things in EPL, maybe even Live Strat?
---
Loss of morals? Really can you troll no better than that?
---
This is not doable in vanilla/classic wow. it was briefly doable in Burning Crusade. If you want info on that read this :  [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Rogues\_as\_tanks](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Rogues_as_tanks)   
---
so maybe/if blizzard releases TBC classic you might be able to do it but considering that for wow classic they used the last patch released as base , i doubt you will be able to do it.
---
50% :))
---
Looks like this guy can't down Rag in sub 1.5 hours or mage farm PepeLaugh
---
This is half correct Information. Only blind does not remove combo points as you don’t physically interact with the mousover target. All other mouse overs (e.g. gouge) will reset your points/add one to the other target.
---
What happens if your guild is loot council and this is the fourth week with no gear from MC/Ony?
---
If someone in your class and spec has two pieces and you have none, that's gquit material and I've seen that a lot on private servers. Loot council sounds real great in theory but every single LC I've been in eventually became corrupt. The usual excuse for the imbalanced distribution by council is "performance" which I think is absolute bullshit on such ez mode content. A balanced distribution of gear keeps more gear within the guild as insurance against high performing loot whores.
---
All of them. I work on the library behind every threat addon in classic, LibClassicThreat. People who claim that one or the other threat meter is “shit” and the other “better” are full of it. Barring immediately after an update to the library, all threat meters are identical.
---
The ones I'm certain aren't lying about it I can really tell. They are very good at negotiating with representatives from various groups. It has been a very useful skill in getting our MC pugs filled before we could guild run this stuff. Getting other groups to merge into ours and such.
---
Report *him* for harrassment ;)

/yell AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA?

yea english isnt my native lang, so shit on my gramma all you want, dont really care

anyone comment on this spec for sword rogue to pickpocket farm and still be able to do decent dmg in groups or raids, or solo farming mobs?
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#f0xfoZG0qbbVzxrox0L
---
I will say this rule can be a little different for healers. I was invited to a PUG last night at level 55 and felt like I was contributing to heals and dispells just fine. Based on the heal meters, I was about middle of the pack in terms of raid healing and while I don't think the meters are the best judge of healing ability, I did feel like I helped the group! Also, I was assigned to raid heals and dispells primarily. I think that this was probably the best choice in terms of my gear, MC experience, and class utility (priest).
---
I just ding 60 on Herod and can't find any dungeon groups... guess I'm way behind the curve.
---
can't even get attuned.
---
Oh, I thought it was a weapon until now and was really confused.
---
Why doesn’t every class use them?
---
I always saw it as the Druid's Flash Heal: An emergency button you wanted to use sparingly so you don't run out of mana. I'd be running out of mana too if I had to use Flash Heal to refresh a minor heal over time effect.
---
Not unless you're exchanging real money.
---
I have healed through MC and Ony with both HotW/NS and a Swiftmend build. Both are viable but I personally like the swiftmend build much better. I don't really understand people who say Swiftmend is useless, it's healing for about 2k for me, and I also get cheaper HT and 10% extra healing.
---
Dude he obviously meant improved counterspell
---
Ah yes, the Great Copper Shortage of 2019.
---
Priest is arguably the best wpvp class in the game. Leveling mine I dont ever remembering having a problem in 1v1s with enemies my level. Our dots hit like a truck and we can just conserve mana for heals while wanding people to death
---
This is a chat addon called Prat. If you just want class colors in the default chat UI, you can type in a console command:  /console SET chatClassColorOverride "1" -- turn off class colours OR /console SET chatClassColorOverride "0" -- turn on class colours.
---
I mean, he's not wrong.
---
People actually do this and it's super annoying to the GM.
---
Well chromaggus has the first set of colors and red+black is pretty much horrible. The colors really define most of his mechanics iirc
---
Dude... Are you scandinavian?
---
cant say for sure but seems like he would still have a regular threat table but sinces he's rooted he will attack whoever is closest regardless of threat
---
They are definitely overpriced I love how i got downvoted lol
---
But Hitcap REEEEEE
---
Good job buddy congratz! :)
---
Kids in 2019...
---
"Store closing clearance"
---
So if it works like that could you just have your tanks stack on someone and never have their threat reset?
---
Class that gets "rage" to use damage abilities, from being hit, does more damage than class that has a depleting bar to use abilities, NEWS AT !!!!
---
Warriors and Rogues "ALWAYS" have a button to press.  If not right this second then after their next swing, or after they get hit next.
---
Shamans and Paladins that spec for DPS do not have this refilling bar.  In the case of Shaman at least we can't use our damage abilities in raids because "Stormstrike" takes a debuff slot, and "Earth Shock" builds to much threat.
---
Add to that Warriors usually benefits from Windfury Totem, and Paladins NEVER get this buff.
---
But let's talk Windfury Totem, if I throw that I lose 4% critical as an Enhancement Shaman, to give warriors a HUGE boost in DPS.
---
So if I as an enhancement shaman, had a refilling mana bar like a warrior has in rage, could use my dps abilities and didn't have to forgo my better for me buffs to augment warriors dps, I might actually be able to get close to their DPS.
---
Stoneform is not better than 25% stun resist. Are you serious?
---
You need to calm down
---
You’re doing something wrong if it’s taking 6 hours.
---
Oh for sure. I have other gear that gets me to hit cap, but it feels good to have the full set.
---
I know this post is old, but I was reading through the comments and wanted to say to any tanks out there. Don't stand for this shit. Tanks are in ridiculously high demand. If you have a DPS acting this way you have a few options.
---
1. Tell them to count to 5 after you charge before they start attacking so you can get threat. Sometimes people have only played retail and just don't realize how different Classic is for tanks. Honestly this works like 50% of the time.  
---
2. If that doesn't work, that's strike one. Remind them again, and make sure to let them know you won't be taunting any adds they pull, so if they die, they die. Your healer will back you up here 80% of the time. The other 20% is typically because they're friends with the DPS in question, or maybe you're legitimately doing a shit job tanking (not all tanks are good at their job).  
---
3. This is the crucial step here. Remember that tanks are the number one most sought-after role in dungeons. Period. If the DPS player(s) continue to not listen, give them the ultimatum. Either the party lead removes the offending party (why are you not party lead as tank? Idk, but on the off chance that you aren't), or you leave the group. Most of the time that DPS player has been kicked before you can right click your own portrait. If they are fine with you leaving, chances are you were the problem, or the other members of the group are friends. Either way, follow through and leave the group, as it won't get better. Find another group and revel in the fact that you will already be at the entrance to the dungeon. 
---
Now, full disclosure, if EVERY group you're in has problems with DPS to that extent, it's probably you. I've pugged plenty on a Warrior tank and a Druid tank, and the amount of times I've had to call for someone to be removed/leave the group myself is in the single digits. Most groups go off without a hitch. Just don't be afraid to throw your weight around. Sitting silent and stewing in frustration only helps shitty DPS players.
---
It is a weapon but only has 3 charges. The reason other classes don't use them is because it has terrible weapon damage. Druids don't actually care about weapon damage in animal form so it's super good on them.
---
If you as mage having a field day against paladins you are facing bad paladins
---
Lol dude what the hell
---
This might work in the rare cases you run across a warlock with a succubus or imp, but if they have a felhunter they can just devour the sheep before you can dent the pet, and a voidwalker will just be sacced from inside the sheep the second you're about to land the killing blow.
---
I get that it's stupid to bitch about this but when people are undercutting so hard that vendoring would get you more money...why?
---
I  play mage though
---
They are both melee and roll on the same gear
---
Be the change you want to see in the world.  
---
Be the good ~~huntard~~ mage that doesn't immediately shatter combo a pack of mobs on pull.
---
Ohhhhhhh okay it all makes sense now. Thank you!
---
I would bet gold on it that this is not the case. The only class winning vs paladins are warlocks
---
No worries! Thank you for a level headed reply! That’s rare these days
---
Yep. Thank you.
---
Seems like everyone here also raided naxx and was rank 14 and also forgot all the mechanics of vanilla.
---
Yep.DPS will still pull fireballs off of you, so you need to be far away from others. But yes. If you stack on someone else, you will go into p3 will full threat.
---
Seems weird that you're bragging about having no life just to shit on OP but you do you, my man.
---
If someone else needs it that doesn't change it's value, it's still 150g lol. Maybe if it was BoP what you said might actually be consistent. Ya'll would benefit from learning a few basic economic principles.
---
So that being said, threat is completely irrelevant then?

A fast weapon is always bis for threat generation because as a (especially fury prot) warrior your threat is capped by how many heroic strikes you can fit in. A faster weapon = more heroic strikes. A faster weapon = more flurry procs = more rage = more heroic strikes. Queuing a heroic strike also removes the DW damage penalty = more threat. 
---
Get out of 2005.
---
Me Mining Only
---
Its a level 30 weapon, which is why no other class uses them.  Weapons for druids are stat sticks, the dps on the weapon itself doesn't matter, the attack speed increase requires the weapon to be equipped for the duration.

No one "needs" gold in the same way someone needs a weapon upgrade. Gold is nice to have, but wanting an easy 100+ gold over someone's weapon/gear upgrade is literally the definition of greed.

And six weeks later this pile-bleeding asstard will be begging for raid groups because his attitude stinks of shit.

Looks like youve got that on lock for me, ty

Still haven't decided.

Not really no. Better off just being combat for raiding.

I prolly should've but too late now.

Hey-o!

Can druids shift out of the freezing band proc? I know Druids are pretty good against mages due to their ability to shift out of crowd control. If that doesn’t work on the proc and they’re attacking with a 1.0 attack speed in car form I can see this being an amazing counter of sorts.

I just read the wow head "guide vs paladins..." wow is that guide plain, simple and wrong.... Running away against an enemy which is ALWAYS faster then you and immune to snare slows? Just outkite him? Lul just think about that.... You have one blink that's it. And one command proc can kill which and command proc do NOT need many attacks. They proc at a 7 proc rate per minute. This means frost armor and kiting (getting less hit) won't help vs command
---
I mean, the point of the guys post was that he was annoyed at mages who didn't respec each week, so he's clearly not willing to live and let live
---
Yeah lol. People talking about burnout to 60. I felt bored a few lvls here and there when do dungeons to grind and I disliked the zone.
---
But really? I'm almost 60. Have some bis already and its phase 1. Honestly I feel likethis character is almost done and time to level the next.
---
Theres not enough in phase 1. Grind one raid or two a week? Meh. Gimme dat pvp
---
Whereas on the btw it's more like, hey I've grinded the past *entirety of account played for over a year* now I can kill abby demons for that nice whip drop!" 
---
4days in game time later. 5 heads and a dagger. You'll get the whip. (A little exaggerated lol)
---
I also like to split up stacks so each auction is less than 1g. I notice that at soon that yellow icon appears, the action sells less.
---
The faster your attack time, the faster you can Heroic Strike. Obviously there are better weapons later like Thunderfury, but Heroic Strike at this phase will build more aggro than your weapons could dream of.
---
When they dont ban you for selling gold unless its blatant and classic gold is easy profit I dont see the complaint here, just saltiness
---
False. It is bis for threat generation because of the insane amount of rage you generate - especially if you dont play Human/Orc and in combo with Edgemasters. Even tho we are then back to the arguement made few post above - how min max oriented are you in PvE if you dont have one of the two races. Regardless the claim it isnt bis for threat gen. is incorrect.
---
I believe if you're on a full server you can get a free transfer
---
Bear is a solid tank, they just have issues with enrage fights or fears. Plus, they don't take warrior Tier gear. No bias here, I swear.
---
Cat does decent dps if tryharding, and provides good raid utility with LotP and battle rez.
---
Moonkins kinda suck, but if everyone else tryhards, bosses die before they oom. And hey, spell crit is nice.
---
And then there's fucking Resto. Only one Druid gets to Rejuv, the others can spam HT - a strictly inferior healing spell that gets bypasses by every other healing class. It's also slow as fuck, so they can't reactively heal. Rank 4 has decent mana efficiency, so all they end up doing is pre-casting R4HT on people. Hot take: Resto is the actual meme spec. It's legitimately as bad as an Enhancement Shaman but people bring Restos because they're healers, and raids always need more healers. Even shitty ones.
---
I believe you can blink out of the stun.
---
Ice block.
---
Blink if he hand of freedoms.
---
Most mages would open with a poly anyway.
---
So yes, if a mage does not have Blink up, ice block and the paladin was the one who initiated the fight in melee range the paladin has a good chance to win.
---
This guy fucks.
---
That's awesome-- I may have to roll one and try it out!
---
You need a different guild. You chose the wrong guild for sure.
---
That can't be right, what happens if you have a 1.3 dagger OH and a 2.6 MH?
---
I look at it like this. If I'm playing a spec I don't want to play to raid then others can do it too or we won't raid. I say that as a Warrior who is fury spec. I'd rather be arms, but I know for raiding that would be me getting carried. My buddy is a shaman who would rather be elemental or enhancement. But he's resto to make raiding better for everyone. If my guild decides they're gonna take these meme specs then that's all good but they better be okay with everyone playing whatever spec they want too.
---
&gt;  P.S. I always have to cleanse curses even in a group with 2 mages...
---
I had an UBRS group with two Mages as well and the tank Druid had to run out of melee range while the Blizzards were snaring stuff still in order to decurse themselves, then go back in as a bear. It's honestly absurd how many Mages only know how to cast Blizzard, like they've never read any of the other skills they train.
---
Yea, I’m perfectly fine with taking a 5s ‘loss’ to people who buy out and re-list. That 5s is worth moving my items quicker. 
---
Plus there’s a few markets that I have a pretty good idea what the moving price is. If the moving price is 50s and the current lowest is 1g I’ll post at something like 70s. Those usually get instantly bought out by people who don’t know the market.
---
Oh, not too bad. Thanks for the info.
---
Did you not know some people in pvp servers are just the worst?
---
Even better if the AH post is by your alt. You can set the market for any item and that cheaper one you're selling here and now will seem like an absolute bargain.
---
&gt; not true
---
So 900 isn't bigger than 800? Huh.
---
I'm not saying you shouldn't discount items in trade chat. I'm saying the opposite. When you are selling in /2 you HAVE to sell for less than the AH. So saying it is cheaper than ah is redundant.
---
I'd love to sit and listen to what they would discuss!
---
&gt; having a ret doesn't help
---
It does if you have less than all 40 slots filled.
---
Good luck getting rank 11 without an epic mount. Every private/scout is gonna be able to out run you lmao
---
It's just projection.
---
I do this to allies all the time.
---
Stalag druid here. 
---
I use pounce and then /lick them as I dash away in cat form. Usually takes them a but to rotate camera and find me.
---
By then I'm usually sitting down far away on a hill and wave at them.
---
Then I travel form away.
---
I like to think I give mini heart attacks. Like when someone jumps out from behind a door.
---
Cept im a kitty. So most people dont get too mad
---
What are we, farmers?
---
&lt;NEXUS&gt;
---
It's the medium cuts that are annoying. Large enough to drag down the price and ruin margins, small enough to risk not getting your money back if you buy out and resell.
---
You died to a level 40 druid... How?!
---
I didn't die to the 40 druid, the 40 druid did nothing that entire fight but heal people and I kept him from doing that.
---
Fucking classic. Also what inspired me to roll my first Druid. That 5 rogue kill scene in Felwood was the sht.
---
Rogues aren't tanks.  I'm sure you'll find out soon enough though.
---
Unless there was an invisible enemy troll body nearby, I really couldn't tell you. Was in the big scarab room. I'm gonna run to ZF with a friend later to test it cause now I'm curious
---
In most cases maybe. But when you're in RFD charging into 5 elite mobs at level 38 (min level for tanking the dungeon) with a 2H, you're going to take significant initial burst damage before switching to def stance + 1h/shield. Healer better be awake. I learned this first hand the other day.
---
I know that douche. I saw him doing it ans gave him a stern talking to and let him know thats a very not cash money thing to do. Theres not too much of that on heartseeker so im surprised hes not bamned yet.
---
The difference is that empty spot isn't gonna get loot. I don't know where on earth you get the idea that no one is respeccing either. My guild has members like myself that respec every Tuesday. 
---
And if you can't afford to respec well that's a personal problem in my opinion.
---
&gt;The ret paladin that provides another blessing, aura, and emergency spells?
---
Lol except they are oom all the time from trying to do damage.
---
Ony is immune to taunt anyway, so this actually seems like a decent strategy to me.
---
Ya.. I'm still struggling to find a guild that raids Sundays/Mondays/Tuesdays at 9pm..
---
I've just started several alts and no way are you late to the party.
---
If anything you're in many ways arriving at the perfect time. The over crowding and rush at launch was amazing yes, but at the same time was a real pita trying to accomplish even the simplest quests due to too many players all trying to kill the same mobs.
---
tbh i'm enjoying the journey even more now with my alts than i did at launch trying to get anything done on my main. Sure there are still many other players in the starter zones and beyond but just the right amount, not a stupid amount.
---
All these people threatening to run to report you (be it blizz or some obscure lists). That's certainly new compared to 15 years ago. Back then it was only insults.
---
yes, what does that have to do with clarifying fees?
---
then that paladin is going holy.
---
one more healer will be more valuable, especially given holy paladin brings the same utility and then some compared to ret
---
So fun in pvp as shadow. Just be prepared to rarely get into raids due to the debuff slot cap on bosses:(
---
Yeah, okay, if everyone who needed on a BOE to sell it for gold immediately went to the AH and spent the gold earned on upgrades, then I'd be a little more sympathetic. Too bad most people are greedy, hence greed, and literally just sit on the gold.
---
We can agree to disagree. I run with people that don't think gold is a need so it doesn't really matter to me what other people are doing. I just think it's stupid that this whole subreddit thinks gold is a need over a gear upgrade.
---
it happens on both sides, on every server.
---
some people are just assholes, not much you can do about it.
---
If you want "fair" duels roll a pve server.
---
Playing a shadow priest in a guild that clears all MC and Onyxia with flask still up (star of trash not Lucifron).
---
Play a hybrid, do your job well. I’m #3 spriest on server and woulda hit #1 if I hadn’t died preraid and lost world buffs. Again, what I’m saying is you can play “meme” specs and meaningfully contribute if you work for it.
---
Not that it’s scarce, but I’d say it’s a pretty dick move if you were literally following him around to each node and somehow getting to it before him.
---
It’s one thing if you’re in the same zone and on the same route, free game. However if you were literally following him around sniping ore, bit of a dick move.
---
Which still doesn’t excuse their attitude urging someone to hurry up and loot the mobs so they can skin it.
---
Right on, my restobear kin! Fifteen years strong and no signs of stopping. From across the aisle, elune watch over you!
---
I'm a fury warrior that would rather be arms as well, I've got 98th percentile average parses and I love my ret paladin and our shadow priest.
---
Ret paladins and SPriests both bring utility to the raid and healers are overabundant so being able to cut one for a "meme dps" that puts out higher numbers but provides the same buffs still leads to a faster clear.
---
This whole argument is incredibly self centered and it's funny non stop putting it on other people "I'm sacrificing you should too" when there's no issues, we clear MC in 1 hour 15 mins with a ret paladin and a spriest. Any guild that claims their ret paladin/spriest/boomkin are the problem has bigger issues.
---
Hahah good god you are so right. I feel bad when I do large pvp fights and see a warrior chilling in nova while a ret paladin has freedom on himself as he chases people down doing no damage or cleansing.
---
Did the ret pallies on this list fail to complete Molten Core because of their weaker DPS?
---
No?
---
Moonglow #1
---
Move to scroll-up and scroll-down for max dps
---
This is the classic content I’m here for. Thank you for this laugh today.
---
Druid healing touch is pretty shit though. You'll get sniped by almost any other healer. Once you have the gear, it may be best to have 1 regrowth/nature's grace druid and 1 rejuv druid. Or you can split the groups in such a way that you each heal half the raid
---
[It would probably be something like this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FPELc1wEvk)
---
I did. Did it once but so far just light freezing. I disabled a lot of useless adding as well. I’ll take what I can get until I can afford a decent desktop.
---
Shadow is the least meme of the meme specs. A good shadow priest is an asset, they do respectable damage and buff the warlocks considerably. But you need to take it seriously and have enough consumables, otherwise your dmg really suffers.
---
Really, Why is that also does it have to be Blessing of Kings?
---
&gt;most horde are smart enough to not fight a paladin
---
Lol Settle down, you're not a Shadow Priest.

When the salt starts to flow, that's your cue to double down.

How do fishing buffs work? If I used a Nightcrawler, and I get +50 fishing, what does that do for me? Am I able to fish for  things 50 lvls higher? Should I be using them to jump start my leveling?
---
Some people are very strange. Like one day I was in Un'Goro killing devilsaurs, and some rogue got mad at me for "stealing" his tag when I couldn't see that he was stealthed near it. When I tell him this he says "Way I see it, if no one is around that's suspicious", uh what? Lol.
---
It doesn't even make its own case. Unless the ret paladins' guilds failed to win the fight because of not enough DPS, ret pallies are "viable". Since we all know that "not enough DPS" cannot possibly be the cause of a wipe on Golemagg, this post is dumb.
---
It’s people like you that I make all my money off by flipping them back for a profit so thank you :)
---
You still need to understand the market to make TSM work well for you.  You cant just install it and magically be an AH god. Sounds like you dont understand what TSM even does
---
I don’t know if you’re aware of this but I never mentioned anything about warlocks or priests
---
I don’t know if you’re aware of this, but you stated that the other guy is wrong and princess cant be soloed naked (I provided evidence otherwise)
---
I don’t know if you’re aware of this, but you claimed princess would 1 shot you if you’re naked. At 3:50 the guy is at less than full health and gets hit and dazed by princess (no shield up prior to hit) and he wasn’t “1 shot”

---
Warriors are not hard. they are slow to level up. and have quiet alot downtime, especialy in later levels fighting mobs who are your lvl. 
---
If you choose to go warrior first aid  and cooking will help you ALOT. dont neglect them and lvl them up while you level. so you save money on food, always have food of ur level and also food gives you extra stamina / spirit buff. and first aid can save you alot, there are so many times where fearing into bandage have saved my life.
---
Lowering it by 1c doesn't change anything about the market, it's just a way of manipulating the sorting.
---
If that WERE the case (it wasn't), then as soon as I stop to pick one copper, he could just move on to the next. You might have never had mining. It isn't instant.
---
A lot?! Wtf are you wearing?
---
I lol’d
---
Lol shockadin isn’t the only way to play a pally.  There is no good plate until phase 3 (outside of t2 helm and legs) so what are you even wearing?  You are going to be the one getting deleted in phase 2 wpvp.
---
Also, shockadins are fun, but really aren’t anything crazy outside of 1v1s.  I’d much rather have imp freedom and just cleanse bot an actual dps, instead of trying to delete someone every 30 seconds.
---
Maybe I’m wrong.  Send some videos of you “deleting” 60s with your current gear.
---
Yo ive been wondering the same thing. I dont think there is an option for quartz, but i have seen some streams/gameplay where they do have the cast bar. Ill look into it more.
---
3%, but still nice
---
If you are using something to auto buy it, that is against the rules.
---
They're probably price-fixing the market for that particular item.
---
Ah, yeah, good point. As long as whatever ability you're using for mouseover doesn't add combo points, you're good.
---
Put a cell under the microscope and it's got a tiny crusader helmet on.

If you download the TSM app and set it up it compiles all the scans on your server over the last 2 weeks and averages them. 
---
Once you have it setup just open the app before opening wow and it will run in the background updating. 
---
When your done playing close the app, it’s pretty painless.
---
Hordes gonna downvote this to oblivion out of being butthurt
---
this is one of reasons i leveled warrior first. other classes will seem like cake walk. i havent hited 60, but i need only 4 more lvls

No kidding. How you like that Viper Sting yo?

52 is fine. If youre healspecc and have some decent gear you can go far

I'm not asking for chevalresque duels, just fights that aren't impossible for one side, risk is more thrilling.

Short answer: take a look at trade skill master 4 aka tsm4, this is quite complex but there is some documentation and tutorial and after digging into it during a few hours/day it will probably suit your needs
---
Dont know if youre aware but the OP is clearly talking about warlock  
---
Dont know if youre aware but private server =/= classic. Try again.
---
If you enjoy healing, I think going into discipline early, instead of shadow, could be viable. You still start from a spec with spirit tap, so at 19 you'd be 5/0/5 but instead of moving down the shadow tree you take discipline talents.
---
If it makes you feel any our guild somehow got both bindings of the windseeker in 6 MC runs. I am still in utter disbelief that it happened.
---
First day on the Internet?
---
I know right? How can someone enjoy doing something that I, myself, dont enjoy? Makes no sense!
---
I don't understand that lol. I found a warrior killing them and he was just letting me skin them for 14g each at the time lol
---
Beer is a *necessary* part of our culture. No one's perfect.
---
I've run 7 scarlet monastery armory now, and every single time the boss drops the shoulders. Bug or just very bad luck? 
---
That would be like \~ 0.00045 % chance to get 7 shoulders in a row?
---
&gt; Shitty community members.  
---
Ahh... Just like back in the day.  I'm overflowing in nostalgia.
---
If you really have an opportunity lined up to be a raid's main tank then warrior is the choice to make there. Levelling won't be bad at all with another person as a warrior.
---
Other than that though, druid has so much utility and versatility it would make an amazing choice, only really limiting you if you are going to main tank raid bosses. Personally I like the more fleshed out feeling of actually playing a warrior with stances, better skills like bloodrage etc but that's something to decide for yourself. You may find yourself frustrated levelling a druid and comparing it to your rogue, where your rogue has better tools like vanish and distract
---
Spirit tap and the improved wand talent are the early necessities for Leveling a priest.
---
Add races that are more in line with early vanilla ideals and wc3. Give high elves to the alliance and goblins to the horde. A big focus of classic+ content can be the high elves fighting to reclaim Silvermoon from blood elves (which are a hostile NPC faction to all players). 
---
Getting a currently existing cartel of goblins into the horde might be a slight stretch, but just about anything would be a lot more realistic than space goats crashing their actual space ship into previously undiscovered islands...
---
I was also very impressed with how badly he fucked up his punctuation.
---
"*keep that in mind, bucko*" needs to become a classic wow meme ASAP.
---
Horde only attack in 2v1 or greater. If you try and 1v1 they either run or just stand there and die. Or they camp flight points and kill people as soon as they land
---
In world of warcraft any context that is not specifically about demons or warlocks, imp means improved.
---
Just like how SM means Scarlet Monastery and not a typo of BDSM.
---
Dude, people in Westfall are annoying about mining. I've had similar interactions. Granted, I will totally go out of my way to grief them if they send that.
---
Unlimited copper.
---
I pugged a raid this past week as a druid. I got 3 epics, 2 of which were BiS upgrades, just because noone else could use them.
---
The last boss will be nigh impossible with a 40 tank and the last few rooms will be quite difficult. I'd say 44+ for a full Ulda run
---
I'm not sure how it's done now, but I remember back in the past druid healers and discipline priests would split the raid amongst themselves to prevent overlap. One restoration druid would heal one half of the raid, the other would heal the second half, etc.
---
I mean you're not wrong at all, and a faster BoP is great too especially when in group anything, pvp or pve, not disagreeing with you...
---
Just saying why not - but if you want the higher freedom uptime that's a pretty valid reason. I'm uncertain why you think you can't cleanse and offer occasional burst in the same spec and atm gear's good for it and stands to be a while, is all.
---
I mean if you don't understand the utility right now of being able to turn your interrupt into a death sentence that's fine too - and I was mostly concerned about your gear statement.
---
PvE servers in a nutshell 🙄
---
Yeah! What kind of garbage human ages past 40. Gross
---
It is DUMB above all else. TBH\^\^.
---
I still remember some of your vanilla PvP videos, mostly because of the very unique action bar swapping for skills :D
---
WB
---
It has a couple conditions:
---
* You must be in a valid melee position for long enough to complete a swing. It starts at the same time the channel does.
---
* The weapon swing time must be less than the channel time for it to complete an attack. Pushback shortens the channel time and can interrupt the melee swing.
---
For example if you have drain life with a 3.6 speed staff and get hit with a pushback of 1.7s seconds, you can then only channel for 3.3s and will no longer get a melee swing.
---
Here's a post with info and an example macro to try it out.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/djh0a7/free\_damage\_melee\_while\_casting\_channeled\_spells/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/djh0a7/free_damage_melee_while_casting_channeled_spells/)
---
That's awesome. You're fine with your guild then. I love my shadow priest too because he gives a huge boost to the warlocks. Ret paladins... what utility do they bring to the table? I also would be willing to bet you have many healers who would rather be DPS too, but they stay healing spec to raid. 
---
You're right about there being no issues as this is MC. But you still need healers and good damage to actually clear the content. No one is doing Molten Core because it's super fun. Especially if they're healing it. I have no problem admitting this is self centered. I'm not there to lose loot to someone that is being carried. 
---
Also why don't you just spec arms then? With your reasoning, it seems fine. As I said above, if the guild is going to let meme specs in then that's okay but let everybody do it. Also arms will still outdamage the paladin =\
---
This sounds like a grade A Karen you're dealing with.
---
&gt; There was an issue with that cpu that may not have been major enough to kill it. If it was heat related artifacts specifically I'd argue your heatsink wasn't properly mounted.
---
The cpu in question was a brand new 9900k, water cooled with a perfectly seated and lapped Nzxt Kraken X72, grizzley paste pea method, which is currently running flawlessly OC all core @ 5.0 ghz and i've had it @ 5.2 on a single core without problems.
---
Nah I’m good I already flushed and washed my hands
---
You know he's pissed when he uses, Bucko.
---
Everything was fine but the juicebox thing is not okay. Shame
---
Are there different quests to it like SM?

You use less data and piss people off less by just upvoting rather than typing out this useless comment

Imagine taking a screenshot and putting this on Reddit *over 40s*. You both are ridiculous, and that's by your own logic.
---
Wait a sec, did you say that warriors are rolling on leather? That’s gonna be an instant kick from me dawg, that’s unacceptable.
---
Tanaris docks to the NE, and Azshara open water is where I've had big $$ fish.
---
As a warlock dueling undead warriors is the fucking worse.
---
That’s the thing tho, in pvp it doesnt necessarily have to be. You only need a proc or two at some point in the ”duel” to be able to find a window of opportunity to capitalize on and finish your opponent.
---
I mean, I appreciated it
---
In the lore, it was the Alliance that fucked them over hard after what had happened, their own story kinda parallels the forsaken in some ways. It was specifically [Othmar](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Othmar_Garithos) (in WC3), who tried to kill them off, and even sentenced the remainder of the race to death. 
---
So Blood Elves being Horde fits, and isn't a retcon after WC3.
---
All horde. They will run if it's even close to a fair fight.
---
My guild's prot paladin has Greater Kings bound to mouse wheel.
---
I used it for like half a level in place of LT and man.....the delay is a killer if you understand what I mean. And you never get as much as a life tap anyways.

There are a handful of quests, a couple are for the area outside the instance and a couple come from inside the instance. The level range is quite large as you advance through the dungeon but there aren't different instanced wings like SM, you'll just notice mobs getting higher level in certain deeper rooms

I'm a software engineer and quite well versed in hardware and I have no explanation for this then. That's fucking weird dude. It's double-weird because the 9900k has better onboard than most iirc. Maybe there was some issue with DX calls-&gt;opcode translation or something
---
Glad your hardware is okay though!
---
Do not copy someone else’s binds. Use binds that you are used to pressing in other games or try things on your own. Just make sure you are using your mouse to turn your character and turn keys are rebound to strafing.
---
Why did you apologize lmao
---
Ah yes the problems with vanilla. Can't wait until that bullshit is patched out again.
---
It’s bad advice. The talent is garbage.
---
I agree to play what you want, but there’s no guarantee that ones selection of class/role will yield the shower of items or gear that they’d dream of as a focused class can generally achieve. 
---
This is because of the population of players doing what you mention which is not giving the hybrid types the time of day to stray from their only “real role” which for all 3 it is widely “accepted” as being a healer. 
---
There are a fortunate few that play regularly as a hybrid and get gear, but their circumstances permit that. It definitely does not happen to everyone.  Hopefully the stigma changes enough someday that it doesn’t matter. For now I have found it near impossible to do with my Paladin what I want with the little time that I have, so rogue alt here I come. :p
---
It depends also on what one wants to get out of the game.
---
I genuinely was a Naxx raider and have the ancient screenshots to back it up, but fuck if I remembered every single exact mechanic of Shazzrah or whatever nearly a decade and a half later. He counterspells people, huh? News to me. 
---
Hell, I don't even remember every boss mechanic in Uldir from retail and that was only one year ago.
---
Damn you lucky! How many runs did it take?
---
What! I'm the better one. I'm nice. I don't even kill allies and instead help them sometimes. Mostly. 🤣
---
350g Daaaaaaaaaamn, on my server it's 500-800g, even with DM out.
---
Lmao
---
Except one guild has a Brm defense raid and everyone else on horde just ignores it and goes to do their own raids, relying on that one guild for their world buffs.
---
All of westfall is ignoring him now
---
Mograine?
---
👈🏻”Bucko”👉🏻
---
&gt; aq and naxx went pretty much unerfed
---
ಠ_ಠ
---
Is there a list out of there of all currently available items with +% chance hit
---
Part of the reason people wanted classic was having the kind of community where if you are toxic or misbehave you get called out for all the world to see which starts to reinforce a culture of hopefully respect. Well here ya go. Cheers to y'all.
---
will try this on sunday, big thanks for info
---
You didn't wait long enough to evaluate whether the comment would be popular or not, it ended up being top, so now you look stupid for calling it underrated and I just want you to really feel this downvote I'm boutta throw your way like a bolt of lightning.
---
I’m sort of on other dudes side side.  I am really sick of spending an hour farming something, then coming back to SW to find that someone has now undercut that item all the way down to basically less than vendor price.
---
There’s actually slightly more mana from the Argent Dawn rep water, so he isn’t.
---
It depends where are you from? I am German and don't know English / American wow internal language
---
Granted! You now have to feed your ravasaur when grown or else it’ll abandon you like a hunter pet. Doing so will make you hostile with the Ravasaur trainers and you can never get your mount back. Tragic.
---
Used in Karazhan!
---
Tbh, coming from wc3, I always thought it was a shame that mages weren't exclusive to alliance, and locks exclusive to horde. I could see the balance issues but it woulda been hella cool to have that much faction distinction
---
I agree. It’s difficult to kill priest prior 60 1v1

Your guild name is my router name.
---
Ahh I dont see him in any of those.  Oh well. It's awesome you managed to save screenshots. I've lost everything I had on my childhood pc. I didn't know I'd regret that until classic came out again.
---
Ret paladins don't have the option to play another spec for dps, we're not going to force somebody to play a healer when they want to dps we can just find another healer. I play fury because I can simply respec and change gear to provide better dps for the guild. If you replaced your ret paladin with a fury warrior you'd still be losing gear to somebody. I'd rather lose gear to a ret pally that puts in 110% than to a fury warrior that does a little more damage but doesn't even bother to get enchants/preraid bis/know his proper rotation.
---
Ret pallies bring a blessing and aura without being a healer meaning faster clears like I said in my post. They also bring a DI for wipe prevention, bop for dps that get aggro and lay on hands for a save. 
---
People keep saying "MC is easy wait until later" but this is vanilla the reality is everything is going to be easier, if you think there won't be ret pallies and boomkins cruising through naxx you're in for a surprise.
---
And finally ret pallies in PvP are a warrior's best friend, if your ret pally gets geared and ends up playing with you come phase 2 you're a force to be reckoned with.
---
Vanilla is a marathon not a sprint.
---
You dont kill any satyrs? ZF would be more efficient gold making for you then.
---
Constipation is no joke
---
I would bet all of my gold that you don’t just “take revenge on low levels and leave them alive at less than 25% health.” as a gnome mage. What do they do? Run off? That doesn’t sound likely and I’m pretty sure you just made that up.
---
Dying and being camped is part of a PvP realm. Wait till you walk into Qia’s room in Everlook and there’s someone in the back corner, or you try to head into BRS for BRD and an enemy MC raid decides to camp the entrance.
---
Had someone lose their shit on me for mining a copper node I had been killing wolves to get to. Like ok I had over a dozen "taken" from me in the same manner like sorry I had to do a body run and you happened upon the 2 of the 6 wolves I had started clearing beforehand. 
---
You think it's bad/rude now just wait until you get to thorium. People *reserve* the nodes in Dire Maul East all the time, at least on my server I see it more over than not. On jump runs.
---
That guy is the kind of person who hopes you tell him to "fuck himself with a hot-poker" so he can ***actually*** report you and get you punished.
---
Seriously anything past 25 and youre already useless

Don’t tell them to speak up if they don’t understand. They wont. Tell them to PM you if they don’t understand, and then address it in discord “someone asked...”
---
Everyone brings x5-10 fire protection potions, and x5-10 Greater Fire Protection.
---
(Baron Geddon trash packs, Domo, Rag)
---
Everyone brings x1 Greater Shadow Protection Potion.
---
Everyone brings x1 Restoration Potion. 
---
(Lucifron)
---
Everyone brings 2 Greater Arcane Protection Potions. (Shazzrah)
---
If they don’t have these pots, they are loot banned from their respective bosses. If they aren’t popping them, they are contributing to your groups wipes.
---
If you have wiped on rag once, take the whole raid up to UBRS. Cycle players in and out, using the priests mindcontrol to give everyone the 80+ fire resist 1hr buff that you get from the spellcasters in the opening room.
---
Because mages are in spellcleave groups just farming the GY and don't fuck with the actual bosses so they never see it drop.
---
Because everyone has a main tank already
---
And it wasn't obvious for me because there are people with other mother language expect English? Duh?
---
Just look at the VC/DM discussion each Server has its own language and as I am playing on a German server no one says IMP spell. For us imp = warlock pet
---
Sounds pretty diplomatic to me.
---
Implying a hunter can’t kite while Stoneform is active?
---
This suddenly makes something make a lot of sense to me!
---
I started playing in December 2007, which was one month into patch 2.3 (I just checked out of curiosity) and there are bits of the old world that seemed really odd to me even though I went ham on loremaster in wotlk trying to get eastern kingdoms and kalimdor done before the cata revamp so I thought I knew the old world pretty well. Turns out the odd bits were largely 2.3 changes that I'd never known the game without!
---
It means when you cast a line, the game calculates your fishing skill to be 50 higher than it actually is (sorry if that part is kind of obvious)
---
It mostly comes into play for a) chance for fishes to get away and b) when that +50 skill helps you cross a threshold, enabling you to fish in an area you wouldn't have been able to before.
---
At a certain point green BOE from the auction house are better than your low level dungeon gear. And you can often find those things for 1-2 gold.
---
I finally experienced this the other day. Leveling in Un'goro when a Devilsaur attacked me. Panicked and was fighting it when a 60 showed up and helped kill it. I sat down to eat for health/mana when they started whispering me demanding I loot it immediately. Guess which mob never got looted...
---
Oh drama in a guild. Who cares fuck outta here with your witch hunting ass post
---
Ahh good old STV, the STD of Wow (for alliance).
---
No one downing naxx the first week it is released won't have 40 people dude
---
My guild is already planning to take off work the Tuesday BWL is released to go for server first

You underestimate the level of neckbeard no lives there are on this game, my man!

From what I’ve seen on these question threads his ability will reset once he respawns so if you kill him you just have to wait till he comes back. I don’t have personal experience but that’s what I’ve read
---
Also can't fit through the door to the repair vendor next to the Orgrimmar AH.
---
&gt;10 runs yet i couldn’t even get Robes of the Exalted. :)
---
Our MT is a beast tbh
---
If you undercut by 1c, i will purposefully ignore your posts.
---
It's called, Chill Out. It's called Relax Dude. And, technically what you're doing is breaking the terms of fun &amp; good times of the sub. Because, you are stopping members from progressing down the comments without encountering outraged flamer-bois.
---
At the end of the day, a ret player knows their spec is terrible, but continues to play it anyway because its "fun". He selfishly prioritizes his "fun" over the success of the raid or making any meaningful contribution. That is his perogative to do so, its a game after all. Its also my perogative to reward members who contribute with loot and permanent raid slots. And its my perogative to not cause loot drama by giving widely desired DPS gear to the bottom performer who only cares about "fun"
---
You haven't seen nothing until you've been in front of the AH right before server maintenance
---
What a tool
---
LOL
---
Interestingly enough, gear basically doesn't matter while AoE-farming. Blizzard has a terrible spell coefficient, so the only thing you realistically need is more Stam/Int to make pulls easier, which is not hard to come by.
---
By standing there and not reacting?  If it was you, would you rather I reacted?
---
Paladin = Alliance
---
Thanks so much! This is my first time playing as a caster so I have tons of questions. Sorry for making your my personal google.
---
What level did you level out tailoring? Also any tips for hitting that much gold in a few hours?
---
I am not surprised that reddit is so Alliance victimplay tilted.
---
You shouldn't need to cast evocation unless 20 dps in your raid is slacking
---
Sorry were you asking me something there? I didn't realize you were expecting more. You kind of just spoke in circles.
---
The person with the most dkp gets first pass at an item.  Then it goes does the list by total dkp until someone takes it or it gets sharded.  We ran vanilla like this and it worked well.
---
Thanks I'll try farming those for a while and see how it goes!
---
That's completely fair, and honestly seems like a good idea , depending on what the player did. 
---
In my case it was just funny because the guy just started out hostile towards me, iirc he was mad because i didn't help him kill some mobs i had accidentally pulled, i ran away because i was on low health and didn't want to corpse run, he apparently charged headfirst into the entire thing, as i feigned death and then kept on running. He whispered me shortly after saying i was a jerk for not helping, i tried to explain myself, but he put me on ignore and complained to my GM before i had the chance.
---
Someone call a priest or a paladin for heals, this player has a stick shoved up their butt. Or possibly a cranial rectal impaction.

What were the material costs at that time? If it was more than 40s, that is silly on their part. But if they were profiting at that price then the real market price is below what you wanted.
---
Cant really expect people to go with what you expect as a market price when they can sell, and profit off a more attractive price range for the buyer.
---
This 1000x over.
---
The number of assholes I've ran into in classic is staggering, but it's the real vanilla experience.  \#nochanges
---
I think the main thing is that there won't be that many spare debuff spots, so Hemo just might not cut it, even if it isn't weak. Better off grabbing the strongest option the raid has available at that point.
---
If you don't mind respeccing, that would *always* be the best option. I thought the whole point of this post was to try and make Sub work to satisfactory level though. Which I think my suggestion of just dropping 2 points out of Sub could just about manage (maybe), with the right guild. :)
---
Id rather you just tell me you’re a skinner. Then i can go on my way.
---
How do you find out the name of a guild master to contact?
---
I don't expect everyone to be, and I don't expect every ret paladin to be good or put in effort, but this thread is implying that ret paladins are inherently inferior to warriors/rogues/mages/etc and they're not. There are REALLY bad people on those classes. If a ret paladin does half my damage I know it's his class, when a fury warrior does half my damage I know he's bad.
---
Also 100g is nothing compared to what good ret pallies put in to contribute to raid, our ret pally is using close to 200g in consumes every week and farming manual crowd pummellers. He outdpses 75% of fury warriors according to warcraftlogs.
---
WoW is a social game, your outlook is the problem here, remember that everyone you're interacting with is a person and the loot is nothing but pixels. Not to mention it's MC loot, most of this is easily replaceable with pvp gear if you genuinely are serious about pvp.
---
bucko
---
OP is saying that ret paladins do less damage than prot warriors, when, in fact, OP is comparing them to fury warriors. Of course ret paladins do less damage than fury warriors.  
---
To be fair, prot warriors probably out-dps ret paladins, but not by the huge margin OP is pretending.
---
No, shitbags who harass women who just trying to play a game are at the center of guild drama.
---
wait is this a mad follow up to the other video from a few days ago where the people called out the ridiculously small time investment extrapolated out?
---
I think that it is lol. So meta.
---
You guys smell that? Mmmm.. it’s the smell of white knights with zero proof.
---
saved this comment for later ty
---
Imagine being such a neckbeard that you whisper the guy who sold a few items below your price.  Now imagine being the butt hurt nerd whose feelings got hurt by said neckbeard to the point they had to post it on reddit.
---
The minute they made it impossible fot my warlock to grief noobs with dreadlord/infernal is the minute I stopped playing Classic.
---
Whats easy for you is not for other. You have a very narrow view of the world around you and my heart breaks for you.
---
Assuming that there's 100k people playing WoW - with 0.00045% chance, 45 of them will get shoulders 7 times in a row.  
---
Congratulations! Now go and find 44 of your brothers and sisters!
---
It’s around 350 on fairbanks as well atm. I’d say sell it if you don’t have things like epic mounts or rare patterns or equipment that you might covet. Remember that time is money and freedom, the more money, the more free you are to pursue non gold making activities.
---
As a Druid that tanks essentially every day, I’m in no rush to get a warden staff, particularly as the +25 agi buff isn’t in the game yet and I have no epic mount.
---
We have 3. No legendaries yet. Don’t want hand of useless though. Give me a set of bindings.
---
The +50 things are not particularly valuable, so there's no point in saving them. I would however try to save the +100 lures for fishing in high end zones like the Bay of Storms in Azshara.
---
I am in the same boat actually no robes. Im just healing in T1 atm cause my tank is pretty damn geared.
---
Is 1% crit chance or 9 magic spell power better? I’m a 60 lock. Is crit chance better than spell power always, vice versa?
---
Where did you grind and which class were you?
---
Trolled
---
Sorry, you misunderstand me.  I was saying that if I was going to ninja your leather, I'd be stealthed until *you* looted, then steal your leather.  No accusations levied.
---
I used the lowest graphics settings possible, even tho, I was told my PC could handle all kinds of high end games, and other people have attempted to play all kinds of games on my PC and they never have any issues. the crashes normally happen when im in a crowded place, i also looked up my graphics settings, did all the scans on my PC like the CMD ones etc, but nothing is wrong, i have no addons due to being a noob!
---
Tribute is so much better now since everyone still wants the rings/staff. I do 3 runs an hour and i can always sell an item for 50g each time. This is like 150-200g an hour depending on drops and the books you get. But will go down to 80-100g once people stop wanting the stuff from there.
---
Still doable with alts no?
---
Nice router name
---
Just want to summarize on this.
---
I have been monitoring this for the past few weeks and Monsterbluff is no longer a part of the guild as his views and ours did not meet.
---

---
It's like 1k on my server, it's certainly still very good. There's just a tipping point where a certain amount of DPS will just beat speed.
---
I know lots of people use it, but I've always been leery of installing some third party application to make my in-game addon work.
---
I think when they said 40-50gph people thought that was pp only. The mining was added on top.
---
According to the commenter, you are mistaken
---
Raid leaders want 40 people, because weak dps is better than no dps.  It’s why I downed rag at 57.
---
We don't care
---
The problem is that auctionator only knows the asking prices, not the selling prices.
---
Yea so I ended up quitting the game for a few months after that so I only got one C’thun kill before I quit. I will say that was probably one of the most fun fights I ever tried. Getting the spacing right was so difficult but very fun mechanics.
---
I'm so upset he didnt get to see your hilarious response
---
Duuuuude! Hahahaha
---
I asked for an answer.  If you're incapable of answering it then fine, it's too deep for you.
---
Oh I understand, you guys are just arguing semantics i think.  What tank goes full prot ? And a tanks rotation is not the same as a warrior dps.  Even tho they spec mostly fury, they are certainly not pulling the same damage as a full dps warrior.  If someone says 'prot warrior' they usually just mean 'tank' because only bad tanks spec full prot.
---
Its Ret prio tbh
---
This is the correct answer 
---
Only one druid should be using rejuv, the rejuv spec's druid 
---
It's an extremely Mana inefficient spell to begin with.
---
I gotta say though getting that early copper in Durotar is a struggle.
---
This!!! I agree who cares, why it has to become public information is beyond me. Will they get away with it? Certainly not but the point still stands.   Why is this reddit worthy?
---
Well he's from WrA so of course he is.
---
Imp rejuv is very unwhelming. Many take a point just to spend the last one. It only boost base healing, nothing from healing power.
---
Oh his wife is still alive just very depressed
---
Care to share your methods with the class?
---
Tanks and healers need clear assignments.  Like which healers focus on tank vs raid, who is main tank and how many tanks does each encounter require, etc.
---
Buckle-up buckaroos.
---
I mean my guild is 7/8 mythic so I'd say it matters for me. Definitely a progression based guild. Not a top guild by any means but we raid 6 hours a week so we do alright. As a player I want to do the best I possibly can.
---
Benthic gear and proper sockets is easily a 10-15% damage increase as a shadow priest. We only scale well off crit and haste so random loot and titanforging is a sizable problem.
---
I've had probably 2/3rds of my retail friends quit in BFA in large part because of the lack of control over their character - particularly looting. Some complain of the unfun grind. I've seen a lot of guilds die because of it as well. 
---
I'm not saying classic is a perfect game. It has many flaws as you outlined one of many. But it is obvious the focus was "what is fun" rather than "what will keep people playing".
---
I mean, you clearly are here looking for people to give you the ol back pat and atta boy so................ if the shoe fits.
---
Call it what it is. If it's majority Fury it's a Fury warrior. Just because they tank don't mean they are prot warrior. I'm levelling an Arms warrior. I tank dungeons. That doesn't make me a Prot warrior.
---
Also, nothing wrong with actual Prot specced warriors. We have 2 in the guild and they are noticably easier to heal while they also keep threat better than the Fury specced guys leading to way smoother runs. So from a healer perspective the Fury warriors are the bad tanks.    
---
      
---
If you're going to compare to Prot warriors compare them to actual Prot warriors. (Prot Warriors will most likely still win that DPS race)
---
Vanilla spinebreaker homies
---
I love a ding right when I'm about to die and I get my health and mana back.
---
That's what I mean by the new players coming to try out classic have a different mindset than we do.  I feel the same, like "Whoah.. I got invited to something!!!" lol
---
I think it was because when wow was new we weren't jaded by memes and min maxing, so we aren't jerks.
---
People that use the term "nerd" as an insult in a video game really baffle me.
---
article says shamans can dual wield?
---
Where did he say he’d be raiding?

---
Low level groups come in waves.
---
For example, around level 30 is Scarlet Monastery. Super lucrative for leveling grinds.
---
When the game started off this place was fucking packed.
---
A few weeks in this place was dead and you could barely get a group because most people were past level 40 and moving onto other raids.
---
But now it's booming again (at least on my server) because you have all kinds of new players still trickling into the game.
---
But you also have level 60 raiders who are rolling up crafting alts and PVP alts or swapping to a new main because they got to level 60 to secure a raiding spot but deep down they hate their class and want to raid with something new without losing their raiding slot in their guild.
---
So depending on where you are in the "wave" you may have a hard time finding groups for certain zones or dungeons because you're just in that slow patch. But you might have the opposite impact where you're in the big wave of people right around your level and are packed with people and you still have to wait to tag mobs because there are too many people doing the same quest.
---
The game has only been out for like 2 months. You've got time to catch up.
---
In another 5 or 6 months it'll be harder to catch up, but still doable. Right now is the best time.
---
You can't get in trouble for that at all lol.  I would have kept stealing the nodes from him, I hate people like that.
---
Everyone that commented cared enough to. Lol
---
Just answering some questions in the thread here. Meh, was some interesting wow drama to poop read.
---
Cheers
---
Fierce warrior, Xenna
---
Yup lol
---
Thank you. I too enjoy BC
---
Nope. Tried that and ended up ruining the market for what I was trying to sell in the first place and it became just too much of it to flip
---
On horde?
---
They cancelled my order too. It's the first collectors edition I've actually bought in like 10 years. Was so salty when I saw my msg come thru.
---
Like seriously Target...how fucking hard is it to tell your programming guys "we have 16 units of this to sell. Put a cap of 16 online. Don't let us sell 20,000 then have to refund the rest."
---
But good thing scalpers got most of these anywyas.
---
Doubt it was ever a 1v1 as the lock and warr are from the same guild and probably playing together.
---
As a 0/30/21 Hotw/NS druid i'm having a blast and my guild is enjoying the flexibility.  I healed ony (was 3rd), OT on domo, main OT on rag (dat FR).  If its a fight that doesnt need a 4th or 5th tank, I just heal it.  On rag I just have the 2nd most FR so I tank that as well.  Also this way all druid tier goes to me since the other druids only play kitty.  I'm not complaining, just really hard to get feral gear lol.
---
What did it say? Pic not appearing for me
---
yea, that is going a bit far.
---
Oh he does, I told him. 
---
He said something along the lines of "But I am just a member, what I have to say doesn't matter" And I went on this whole speech about how I was tired of hearing that bullshit. I'm one fucking person, but if every person who said "I'm just a nobody" spoke up, shit already would have been changed for the better. 
---
When you are part of the machine, when you are helping everyone else progress, you fucking matter. If someone tells you that you don't, they are an entitled asshole. 
---
I hate that "You are replaceable" mindset. Sure, you can replace a dps, healer, or tank but you can't replace the player that went out of their way to help the guild get to where they are when they didn't need to. You are going to replace them with someone who's looking to pug just to get gear. Don't be that guy.
---
The owner of the discord ban people who kill him in pvp and ban people they have a personal problem with, even with the moderator banning a bunch of members with a personal grudge and topping of with defamation since there's no proof the claims she still get to keep the mod because they are friends, its a bandwagon where they do what the want.  
---
This wouldnt be a issue if it was their discord, now they claimed to make it official and thats where the problem comes in.
---
Criminally underrated comment
---
Here's my reasoning for undercutting like this: I want my stuff to sell because it's not worth the time it takes to post it again. I want the gold, and I like playing the AH a bit, but i don't want to spend more than 10-15 minutes a night listing stuff.
---
Didn't try - but I guess it works as its just a bind on use item.
---
Roleplaying as a NPC.
---
This is next level.
---
For casters and hunters, yeah. For melees, no.
---
I think it depends on the server, honestly. I don't see many people around my level. Its almost impossible to get a dungeon higher than WC but below SM Cath. It took four hours to get a sfk group the other night. And it was just a high level healer clearing out his tank friends questlog. (And me and my my friend who were lucky enough to be invited. )
---
She did post "proof" which was screenshots completely unrelated to the claims.  
---
It was about some guy apologizing for something that happened in a nsfw discord which was completely unrelated to the "official" server to begin with
---
Go for the throw back and have some hot pocket shells and mountain dew cans laying around.

Haven’t picked a server but I’ll be playing alliance.
---
If I'm on a PvE server when P2 comes, is there any reliable way to gain honour before battlegrounds are released in P3? Not looking for a high rank, just some of the earlier rank rewards.
---
This I like, Warlock is overall a weird class. 
---
If orcs had learn to live with it I get it but humans in Fel that is weird.
---
I'd say I'd buy it from you but it's the scalpers that are ruining all the shit. Enjoy your box, hoarder.
---
I usually bow lol
---
It belongs here because they are supposed to be representing the official discord for the server and people need to see that this is not what we support
---
Did you do any Judgement of Light testing in classic yet? It has been a huge source of threat on private servers from what Ive heard and could be a significant boost to TPS. 
---
Im also wondering if any weapon procs with armorsundering effects (annihilator, bashguuder, etc.), silence effects (silent fang), purge effects, etc. generate bonus threat. If anybody knows/tested Id appreciate any insights!
---
This has been a test of our emergency community moderated broadcast system.

As you can see it was a failure and the truth is the armchair developers and “would be amazing” moderators failed, because at the end of the day it always comes down to someone using their “power” to misuse it for something ridiculous like this.  
---
No community moderated Discord server will be impartial because there is no accountability behind it and it devolves to this lame shit.
---
But the beginning of the pull is the most important. Having an extra druid with imp motw adds no value either.
---
So the argument doesn't hold up that furor doesn't provide value in raids, or that furor isn't useful at all in raids.
---
And not only that, but the real value is the ability to tank dungeons outside of raids. Having more pieces of dungeon prebis is much more important than spending even 1 minute worrying about imp motw
---
WTS u/Quazarz cheaper than AH!
---
Bartender Spazzring is an incredibly easy solo. Nasty MH dagger drops for backstab rogues, and the chest piece (+18 str / +10 agi / +18 stam) is a 30% drop

Thank you.  Yes as you say it's 100% down to the raid leader.   Their concern is completing the raid with as close to 0% of problems as possible.  It's not saying it's right or wrong.  They're just doing what they do.   A lenient raid leader will be lenient, and a strict one will be strict.  It's not something super secret - people just need to prepare themselves for that.
---
Yikes...
---
Who cares
---
So why are you in the trade window?
---
Just out of interest could you heal with your prot build in healer gear? I want to level my paladin to heal but I'd love to be able to tank and heal while leveling.
---
I redact my statement then
---
its fine if you can hold aggro. Ive healed a group consisting of 3 melee 1 range and i was basically healing all of the melee as if they were all tanking and i oom'd every pull. whereas if the bloke could hold threat im sure i would make it to at least 2-3 pulls and if prot spec 4-5 pulls
---
BGs aren’t in yet and this post is specifically about numbers and world pvp. 
---
And your last paragraph... actually shut the fuck up.
---
Don't apologize! Sorry's are appropriate sometimes, this isn't one of them.
---
People do give a shit now because of how they aired it. I’m just posting this for visibility . It’s not even about the original claims by this point. 
---
There are 6000+ people on that server (who had no idea it was private) who got dragged into this drama. If someone ninja loots, publicise it so they don’t get groups and hopefully don’t do it again. Same rules apply here, such is classic...
---

Exactly this. Can't believe people think it's a bad thing that this is being called out?
---
Now I wanna watch that again. But it’s dangerous, because that show makes me hungry for whatever reason.
---
Ok, sounds reasonable. Still he had no trash. :P
---
I definitely know the feeling. I see a lot of folks saying this, that, and the other thing. There weren't *that* many players before BC, so at some point you start to doubt. Whenever I encounter other players that supposedly played on Feathermoon-US, I ask about things that happened on the server to determine if they're BSing me.
---
I did Ashenvale at that level then 1k needles. Hillsbrad will have stuff for you to do also.
---
Lol at only bad tanks going full prot. Pretty much as long as you don't have threat problem(so we are talking there full try hard HORDE guilds with full consumables and imp windfury so their melees are getting close to 1k dps mark) there is no point to go fury as you put uneccesary burden on your healers.   
---
I love seeing all these blue geared fury-prot warriors following blindy top 0.1% meta and hitting juicy 300 dmg bloodthirsts, while in deep prot they would be shield slamming for 50% more dmg.
---
This looks like the Standard Target frame. Have you some addons installed that may interfere with this like grid or something?
---
Honestly this makes me want to play a Paladin. Lol. Nice job!
---
Haha, OK. Children in Africa are starving... so suck it up Warrior.
---
Imagine taking a 15 year old video game this seriously, instead of taking actual life things seriously. Yowzers
---
If I was to level a warrior, I would not quest at all after level 15. I would start tanking dungeons from 15-60 and level that way. You will find it very easy to get a group for any dungeon you want as a tank. This way is actually easy to level a warrior.
---
I'll likely give it away. It is a sweet box.
---
aand just for that you should get prio on one item or two. i would probl do this no problem for a full guild run and everyone ells is doing smth to contribute.
---
"They move all day, I'm just pissed off for no reason as according to me my product will still sell"

---
Pause for epic PC meltdown.
---
I mean.. You're crying about how people choose to sell their stuff in a game
---
You probably know a better way to show that we both have it in one screenshot? Please share.
---
Figleaf answered pretty well! 0/30/21 is still a strong healing spec. You raw healing power will be worse than a balance/resto or deep resto of course but, your mana pool will be huge if you focus on Int. but you’ll like to keep + healing too, else you’ll have to spam higher rank of healing touch and you will consume more mana.
---
The 1.2*int is a good rule to prioritize items.
---
Last but not least (and not pleasant) as your mana pool is bigger but you healing power is a bit worse than other spec, you are the best decurse bot of the different healers...
---
If there is in game chat logs to prove what the deal was, then yes it’s it’s a substantial loss blizzard will normally do something.
---
tbh Kingship of the North has not gotten any significant drop yet. No ony weapons, no rag weapons and we've been one of the earliest guilds clearing. We've had 2 brutality blades, and one corehound tooth drop in total. Kind of disappointing
---
widdle baby doesn't like seeing things in trade chat.
---
This really depends on the item too. I have made Greater Arcane Elixirs since week 2, i used to profit 1.5g per off them. Recently some ass hat keeps undercutting by 10s every day and now everyone selling them only profits maybe 40s per sale. Luckily this last raid night everyone sold out and i was the first to relist and reset the price up to where it should be given the rarity of the recipe.
---
Thank you very much mate!
---
Real gs stay to wand him once after regen. Full duration sheep can last longer than eating.
---
Wow you sound obnoxious. It's the most popular chat program and the biggest discord server for one of the largest EU WoW servers. Of course it's relevant.
---
As long as the conversations happen in client, blizzard can help.
---
+5 damage equals +20 ap with 100% uptime vs crusaders +100 ap with 15-20% uptime.
---
For daggers +5 damage is leaps and bounds better than crusader
---
Is this English?
---
I guess I should have worder it better: the unkillable mobs were given a 100yd leash. Teremus doesn't fall into that category as he isn't one of these special quest mobs.
---
I'm not too sure on the people in this thread claiming to have pulled up until TBC/Wrath. I trust them as much as I trust people who say they were Rank 14 in vanilla. Many people have fuzzy memories (or outright lie) and I'd more likely trust the wowhead comments made during that time:
---
* [Servant of Razelikh](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=7668/servant-of-razelikh#comments) "By Rickye on 2006/07/05 (Patch 1.11.1) - They seem to have nerfed the kiting of these guys, i was completely unable to get them past a certain spot.

Officially leashed to the Badlands as of patch 1.11."
---
What server? Fairbanks isn't so bad on average.  
---
Still, a lot of people bring a whole ton of entitlement with them into the game. They completely suck the fun out of the game.
---
Bidding on the short term auctions so they end during maintenance and you can't get outbid.
---
let me get this straight, there is no reason to get a lvl 60 mount before lvl 60, right?  it's just nice to get it done, so you can focus on other things afterwards.
---
For offrace (non orc/human) warriors, getting +5 (aged core leather gloves) or +7 (edgemasters handguards)  to your weapon skill is a major factor for both reducing your hit cap (from 9 to 6%) and reducing the damage penalty of glancing blows (40% of your white hits deal 65% damage; with 305 weapon skill they deal 85%, with 307, 93%). Humans and orcs don’t need edgemasters, as the slight reduction in glancing does not outweigh the loss of using a better pair of gloves as long as they use their racial bonus weapons. 
---
Because of the cost edgemasters have on many servers ($$$$), and because rogues can get weapon skill from talents, and because many pve rogues prefer swords over dagger play style, warriors have a solid chance at going daggers. ACLG offers much better stats than edgemasters, and because Bloodthirst is not weapon damage based, daggers are very much viable as a weapon choice for a fury dps warrior. For tanks, the fast weapon speed provides more consistent rage gen as well as better heroic strike spam (once rage capped) which provides better threat due to HS’s high base threat. 
---
This varies faction to faction—human fury’s will preference swords as using actual good gloves will outperform using edgemasters axes or ACLG daggers for them. Likewise, offrace alliance warriors can get preference on Deathbringer, the 1h axe from onyxia because edgemasters provides axe skill without having competition against human wars or dagger rogues. 
---
For horde, orcs will get preference on deathbringer due to their racial, most rogues will try for swords or daggers, which leaves off-race horde warriors having to choose between daggers or swords. 
---
Typically, offrace warriors will go for whatever they can get their grubby edgemaster-covered hands on. But yes, dagger warriors are very much a thing and are completely viable. Mostly, it depends on the preferences of the rest of your guild’s rogue/warriors and the races they selected.
---
Yeah, just have who is crafting it type in chat that they agree with the deal.
---
I'm still waiting for this to happen in my raids. Top DPS all day baby 
---
- a rogue
---
Dude. This entire thread was looking at Fury warrior boots as general bis items. They're all so fucking similar that it barely matters. I'm simply saying they all these boots in question, are "bis" until phase 3. Which they are.
---
I got most if not all of my dps gear while playing prot warr, but i made sure everyone in grp understood that i was gonna roll for them. :o almost all said okay or fine.. 
---
312runs of arena for my chest was the real pain.
---
As a bear main in retail I wanna play bear on classic but the community's insanely elitist when it comes to specs. 
---
You can see a ton of it even in this post with shit like "feral's ***supposed*** to be a shitty dps"
---
&gt; If I'm playing a spec I don't want to play to raid then others can do it too or we won't raid
---
If you're forced into playing a spec you don't want to play why the fuck are you in that guild? I much rather not play than play something I don't enjoy.     
---
Sure, if you're into that "we need to optimise OR ELSE" mindset, knock yourself out. I much rather take along only feral druids, critturkeys, and ret paladins and talk shit to eachother all raid before playing with people who aren't enjoying what they are playing.
---
You learn your first greater blessing at level 52 so not alot of spellcleaving before then with spamming blessings.
---
You also won't be wearing cenarion, you lose way too much throughput.
---
Druid 3 pc on t2 is the most important set bonus.
---
Start grinding dungeons like BRD for pre-bis gear. Also, at 55 I would do your MC and Ony attunements which also take place in BRD
---
duh, dude, those are goblin beds, didn't you smell it?
---
You aren't late by any means.  In addition, Druids are beasts (no pun intended) at solo leveling, and from what I've seen, many guilds are still starved for them.
---
Someone who gets attacked by a devilsaur.

Orc player tries to sell something in trade. Reviting story for sure. Thanks for sharing.

Chucking piss jugs
---
had to put in a GM ticket.  They were pretty quick about it
---
You have so many wizards in Dalaran there gotta be some shady ones.
---
Yeah that BiS list is total shit. Never trust a list that you cant see stat weights and calculations.
---
People started realizing they were wasting multiple tier pieces every run by not having druids
---
I honestly dont know. Most of mine were from materials I gathered myself, and that was day 1-2 of release when the prices hadnt stabalized.
---
The price was going to tank soon enough, anyway, so not something I was super angry about, but nobody is going to convince me that selling things for a fraction of what you can get for them is anything short of idiocy. And I dont have 24 hours a day to stay in town and prevent one moron from cutting the market value of an item by 1/3 like everyone else here thinks is feasible. "WhY dOnT yOu JuSt BuY tHeM iF tHeY aRe So ChEap" - guy who apparently never leaves org
---
Stop using that list, it's not accurate.
---
Nice buzzword doucheiu
---
Druids smash pallies (atleast at 47)
---
Yeah guess its a bug then Ive removed all addons and deleted my WTF folder several times but still cant get target status text to display. Same thing on another account too.
---
You'll be totally fine
---
Dawg you gotta look up a BiS list sometime, not just assume Warrior = Plate.
---
I agree that it likely wasn’t the case and I’ll take your word for it. He should have moved along. Just playing devil’s advocate.
---
Selling cloth works well too because it's always in demand but linen is usually pretty cheap
---
Any fights that expose the bad mages? I gotta start practicing ahead of time!!
---
Some people can't take no for an answer. That's okay, not your problem.
---
&gt; Why do bad players flock to reddit and endlessly post how they don't care about minmaxing or rushing through content?
---
I don't have a problem, at all, with other people being better at this game than I am.  What I have a serious problem with, is the fact that in this game at least, being effective at the game almost always seems to correlate with both elitism and pointless viciousness.
---
I also truthfully don't understand the logical point of having a massive game like WoW on the one hand, and then being continually obsessed with the last 1% of it, to the extent that the entirety of the rest of it is completely ignored.
---
Someone was undercutting below vendor price on cloth last night so I bought it all and made a few silver in profit. People are dumb.
---
Same! :D I heavily assume it's an isolated incident. I'm only level 30, but I can't imagine it changing much. Even trade is pretty tame during the hours I play. (Nights and weekends)
---
Just a note- this appears to be w/o worldbuffs unless I'm looking in the wrong place.
---
I bought up all the small radiant shards and resold them for 1g more. If this guy seriously thinks he knows how to “Econ” then send him my way I must be doing something wrong
---
I literally never buy something that's been undercut by 1c. Hell, if I am buying something like Krol Blade, I won't even buy the item from someone who undercut by just 1g.
---
Packing the tank too late was a pretty big sin too... or getting caught by the debuff. Seen plenty of people suffer through that one.
---
I can spend all my gold on junk from this moment on :D
---
I am a priest so I never did first aid, but my friend that is a warrior did and we have been buying all of it we could find and doing just that. :D
---
I usually skip nodes and cut them off so they cant find anything.
---
Yep I stand corrected
---
fury tanking is cancer. people need to stop trying to meme
---
Like half a fury warriors BiS gear is leather...
---
Most streamer raid leads/GMs are toxic as fuck. The amount of wholesome streamers that arent abusing their priveledge/status to get funneled gear is miniscule. That just comes with the territory when you have an army of minions giving you handouts willingly.
---
Micro transactions
---
Faerlina would like a word with you. There are more Alliance than NPCs and STV is 'Nam
---
It has nothing to do with me. It has everything to do with how Vanilla was designed. Until you can bring some super geared person to carry your dumb ass, I'm not bringing you to a group if you play a shitty hybrid spec. I have tried it multiple times, and it simply is not worth the effort. If I am having a hard time filling I will take up to 1 hybrid, but I can promise you there will not be a ret/prot pally, or a druid that isn't bear in any of my groups if I have a choice. It is simply a much less fun experience that I don't like doing. 
---
I get just as mad at real classes playing badly, don't you worry. But I straight up refuse to play with druids I don't know and any paladin that isn't healing.
---
Verbal digital contract over WoW chat logs, state the items being given, the item wanted or to be crafted, and the parties involved and the fee or pay.
---
Then have the crafter agree, by typing "I agree" or something of that nature.
---
If they run off with the materials blizzard will view it as scamming or theft and a clear and conclusive chat agreement will streamline recovery of the items.
---
Is this Grobbulus out of curiosity?
---
Horde always seems to be in groups ready to pvp in almost every contested zone on Grob.
---
What? I've only died once to a paladin since 40. Walk-kite when they bubble if they follow or stand at a distance while they self heal, kill them once it ends. Easy.
---
Thanks for the comprehensive explanation.
---
I'm playing a human warrior and I've tried playing with 6% hit and it just isn't all it's made out to be imo. Yes, all my abilities land, but again, like 80% of damage is white and i miss out on so much dps by stopping at 6%. I've tried both in raids and I just like to keep it up a bit more.
---
Yes, I could utilize the HS and Cleave "bug" that makes the off-hand a guaranteed hit, but to be honest, I don't enjoy doing that every fight.
---
I would go with Battlechasers, except I can't afford to lose hit right now. I also can't afford them in general...
---
Good point about kings! Didn't think of that. I'll stick with my bloodmail boots for now.
---
Fights lastning 20 seconds, 100% recklessness uptime etc.
---
This guy auction houses!
---
I loved Sword Art Online too....but wow...
---
&gt;  I think she uses only Plate gear no matter how bad it is for DPS 
---
What, in case she pulls aggro from all that dps? Lol.
---
Joke's on you, they meant Kael'Thas.
---
And in Magister's Terrace.
---
Dm buffs, a good group with high overall DPS, and good weapons. 
---
The fights are short if everyone is juiced up with buffs, DPS will be high especially when ppl are tryharding for good parses. Especially so in a competitive guild environment.
---
Everyone drinks at the same time though. Better than cleaving through smaller packs and then waiting for healer to drink anyway.
---
Moonglow druid should be healing touch duty, they get 0.5 second reduced cast time on their next spell when they crit and hots can't crit.
---
If you're going to have a dedicated HoT druid he should be deep resto with swiftmend.
---
Do that to devilsaurs
---
Wrong
---
It's still good
---
Ret paladins aren't even rolling on the same gear that Fury Warriors are rolling on jfc.
---
They arent so close it doesn't matter. BiS is BiS, not second third fourth best. Windreavers are like 5th or 6th best.
---
Black dragonscale boots enables a powerful set bonus that will give you over 1% crit worth of stats over the second best gear arrangement.
---
1% crit is alot. Its like saying cadaverous legs are bis. Actually its worse.
---
the problem with this is that the same quest that rewards this also gives deadskull shield which is also a bis item
---
That seriously happened to me (I’m an officer in my guild) and the GM last night. We were whispered over allegations that another guildie was botting and the guy got really angry at us, told us as his guild mates it was our job to fix it.
---
Except...the GM and I personally know the guild mate, as all three of us are IRL friends. That particular guy accused of botting uses a computer that’s practically broken. 
---
The complainer told me that if we were friends of course there’s no way I would report him. Well, I wouldn’t report someone that I have seen play and know firsthand isn’t breaking the rules. You want to report him? Then report him, but don’t go whining to their guild, it makes you sound like a total loser.
---
+5dmg to AP conversion depends on the speed of a weapon.  On a 1.8 speed dagger is would about 38AP.
---
Crusader is 100str which is 100 AP for 15 seconds on 1PPM.  the 1PPM means the proc rate is dependent on the weapon speed.  With a 1.8 speed weapon, it would have a 3% chance to proc.  Now is when we get into fun times.  That proc rate is the one used BUT you aren't taking into account the increase proc chance from using weapon abilities and slice and dice.  With a 1.8 speed mainhand you get 33 attacks per minute.  With snd up that goes to 43 attacks per minute.  With backstab you are getting about another 10 attacks per minute.  This moves you proc rate from 33/33 = 1PPM to 53/33 = 1.6PPM.  With a 15 second uptime you have 15*1.6 gives a total of 24seconds of uptime.  That is a 40% uptime, or an average of 40 AP.
---
Now since you are doing it wrong, that crusader DOES affect your offhand which the +5 weapon damage does not.
---
As I said, crusader has a very minor mathematical advantage, but it's incredibly minor and not really a big difference.  Neither is "correct", but anyone who says +5 damage is hands down better is simply wrong.
---
It’s counted as a stun, not cc. Keep in mind that freezing band only procs 1% of the time on a melee hit
---
You should be fine. We've got a couple kiwis in our guild on a NA server. I haven't heard them complain about lag or anything.
---
Right that's how it works on retail. But according to what I read at Classic launch the API that allows the use of the TSM app didn't work. Based on what I scanned from a patch note for Classic TSM this has been worked around with manual scanning by the individual.
---
Good to know, thanks for your input!

---
Can a mage not just blink every so often to get range and fire blast a paladin's health down? As long as a mage stays 10 meters away, seems like an easy win or just poly to escape
---
Why are you all greeding on a 15g essence is the problem.
---
Has the warrior put in as much time and effort as the rogue? Yes he has, stop feeling entitled and have a roll together. It would seem the most fair way.
---
However warrior can wear all armor and weapons types so he would have the most opportunities for upgrades, probably twice as many rolls of gear as letssay the rogue. Is that fair? Meh not really. A rogue rolling for an important piece has priority in my eyes.
---
If you play in a group you play more often in. Most effecient way is loot goes to one person, that distributes the item to the best candidate who can make most use of it. This isnt always as easy as on paper.
---
You can also save yourself from a wipe by doing more dps.
---
Tldr +5 damage is better than crusader due to the constant bonus you will get which allows you to min/max your DPS better without having to rely on crusader proccing at optimal points  during bossfights. Crusader for daggers is garbage.
---
Take two rogues side by side, same gear same everything. The only difference is +5 damage and the other rogue has +crusader. The +5 damage rogue will average higher dps. Period.
---
That is the exact reason I am okay with undercutting. I know the dude who plays the market will buy it and repost. I make money, he gets to play how he enjoys, everyone wins.
---
I see what you mean, and understand why it is important to be a little more on the over prepared side when it comes to tanking with a build that in the past seemed unconventional. 
---
It seems like more people spec fury prot now than deep prot however. It seems like with the mitigation talents all being early on in the prot tree, you can get the essential talents that make it easy to add threat, but you can also go deep enough into the furry tree to get talents that provide more damage and therefor rage. Overall I think I should give it a shot... I’m full pre bis atm, and it makes sense.
---
Great
---
No sweat, and have fun in Oz!
---
This is such a stupid post. No one is trying to argue that Ret paladin is better than Fury Warrior, but Classic just isn't difficult enough to create a world in which bringing a Ret Paladin will cost you your raid. Even looking at these logs, 400+ dps is more than enough for a dps spot to contribute. Paladin also has the added bonus of being a great Healer, but if you don't need the extra healer why not have them swap to Ret and do some dps. The whole point of hybrid classes is flexibility and ability to cover multiple roles.
---
&gt;they see me scrollin', they hatin'
---
Sure. Whatever you have to tell yourself. And darnassus burned down cuz of a forest fire. Horde have no honor.
---
It’s not a given that they’ll leave. When I had skinning I came across a devilsaur and killed it by myself as a prot warrior. After I killed it a scummy dude turned up to steal my skin. I told him to leave but he wouldn’t, so I thought I’d be fast and loot then skin before him. He was faster than me though and stole my skin, so I called him an asshole, so of course he reported me for foul language and put me on ignore.
---
One the classic pally discord that's actually in their FAQ about what to say if a raid doesn't want you to come as ret.  Literally remind them that all content can be cleared with 39 and you're better than nothing.
---
Yay for west fall server
---

Tips is hilariously clueless about the game. The fact he’s bad should surprise absolutely nobody.
---
I ran my friend through 4 runs last night, first three Herod dropped the helmet, last run he dropped the leggings.
---
Deserved
---
&gt; there’s more to it, having fun with your guild and creating moments.
---
that's fine but don't try to argue that ret isn't garbage tier dps
---
He’s used to retails empty world
---
I do agree with your first statement and I get where you're coming from. In an ideal world I'd be on board with you 100%.
---
But since I wouldn't pass on a 150g bag, I'd find it consistent to need on a 150g item to ensure I wouldn't be skipped on it. I've won a purple this way and ended up giving it to the tank since he was quite the lad. I can say I'm with you from where you're coming from, but I'd have to agree to disagree with how I'd react to the situation. Cheers :)
---
I don't use consecrate on boss fights, and threat is rarely if ever an issue. Obviously for fights where you are out of play for periods of time (long CCs), or fights where they are spell immune, og an aggro reset, this is different, but generally for almost all bosses I don't have any experience with loosing aggro. I've tanked all dungeons in the game as a prot Paladin.

Honestly, consecrate is really inefficient in generating single target threath overall. It's much more efficient to spend that mana in other places.

I live in sweden and it was quite easy to get hold of one. Several retailers in sweden had them, and both UK and DE Amazon.
---
Just unfortunate for all of you that wanted one but couldn’t get it.

I imagine that macro only casts moonfire, right? You need to add some conditions or use other skills in it to get it to proceed. Since moonfire is an instant cast spell with no cooldown, your macro will always cast moonfire.  
---
/cast [nomod,@mouseover,harm,nodead] moonfire  
---
/cast [nomod,@mouseover,noharm,nodead] rejuvenation  
---
/cast [mod:shift,noform:1] Bear Form  
---
/cast [nomod,form:1] Enrage  
---
I'm not sure I got this completely correct, but it should cast moonfire on enemies, rejuvenation on allies (and you can have it cast on whatever you are mousing over). If you hold shift and use the macro, it will transform you into a bear. If you are already in bear form, it will cast enrage.
---
If you're a druid, keep it and flex on literally everyone. It's Bis for forever bro, just enjoy having something most people never will
---
almost everyone killing devilsaurs is there for skinning,  there is literally no other reason to be farming there as there are much better places for just regular mob farming or leveling.
---
Just because someone says “no shit” doesn’t mean they’re up in arms haha.  Saying it’s fake is just something painfully obvious.
---
If it’s pvp roll a rogue and sap him everytime he tries to mine that was my favorite aspect of pvp servers before ore spawns didn’t matter. And technically isn’t him telling you not to do it him trying to prevent you from progressing too
---
Man, the only thing I remembered were the patrols in deadmines after bosskills. Clearing the cathedral before doing the boss in Scarlet Monastery because "super happy fun pull everything time". Dismiss pet before jumping down anything. And "Shoot skull first, then cross, then moon". And the pet/skull/cross/moon things aren't even relevant to me anymore because I decided, for the first time in my life, to play a healer. All other shit was basically half remembering shit when I got to that point or having to relearn.    
---
I basically lived in Alterac Valley and Arathi Basin and I couldn't even tell you how to properly do those anymore until I get back in there. (and those are going to be a learning curve as well. Since, you know, first time healer)
---
First aid is still useful as a priest. Especially during raiding and pvp.

Keep that in mind

80% of your damage shouldnt be white , HS queuing or not. Adding hit smooths out your rage and makes it easier to do an "optimal" rotation, but its not actually a dps increase. Its more like a handicap.
---
As you get more gear, you will have way more rage and yellow damage will rise alot.
---
Fake or not this shit still makes me laugh
---
lol you're full of shit. You're exactly the type op is mocking.

Everything in 2019 is harassment, what a joke

"Well hey buddy, I'm giving you a GREAT deal, if they sell like hotcakes, buy it from me and resell it for 39.99 silver more, everyone's happy!"

This happened in a guild my dad and I were in about 20 years ago in EverQuest. A player ninja looted something and since my dad was an officer we had to track him down. I was a druid so I teleported to the zone he was in buffed everyone with SoW and we all ran around the zone tracking for him. Pretty hilarious looking back on it.
---
Your analysis is impeccable.

Alliance are the worst filth in gaming. Don't talk about honour.

Not even bro! I’m on Whitemane and I only get 1v5’d.

I raided Naxx and AQ 40. Alas the guild fell apart on the 2nd or 3rd Naxx boss because people couldn't handle wiping. Apparently it's easier to gquit, server transfer, and join a new guild than it is to suffer through learning new content as a guild.
---
People who were really there have battle stories. People who weren't really there claim to have aced it all with no problems.
---
You're missing the entire point though.  For a lot of people in this game their goal isn't to clear faceroll raids as quickly and efficiently as possible then log off until next Tuesday.
---
The famed "challenge" of Warrior levelling is not because it's "hard" or "difficult", but rather because of the punishment that comes with situations such as respawns when you are already engaged.
---
Every other class has a tool to deal with these situations, the most notable examples being:
---
* Priest/Druid/Shaman/Paladin have healing.
---
* Warlock/Hunter have a pet.
---
* Mage has unrivalled CC and blink to open immediate gaps.
---
* Rogue has blind for immediate CC, or vanish for self-preservation.
---
Warrior has nothing. You have two options: pray to RNG and hope you win the numbers game, or the laughably ineffective escape tool that is hamstring -&gt;  shield+defensive stance -&gt; run (which obviously will not always work because mobs slow, enemies are, you're in a cave backed with respawns etc.). While every other class has an answer, Warrior just doesn't and this usually ends up with a corpse run.
---
Couple this with the extended amount of downtime due to lack of self-healing and CC, and it's easy to see why Warrior is considered "hard" to level, but "punishing" is definitely a more appropriate term.
---
If I was the employee I’d probably be laughing while typing the generic response it’ll be better because you know the response will just piss him off
---
I'm sure there will be large scale battles going on in Southshore / Tarren Mill, STV, and BRM. You just will need to find out where all the pvp is happening. Unfortunately, you won't be able to go to less populated zones to find very much small scale pvp as likely, the players won't be flagged for pvp.
---
&gt; I think I've gotten lost, or almost gotten lost, in every dungeon so far, and I played quite a lot of vanilla.
---
Same here. I've asspulled damn near every skipped pack ever because I have the sense of direction of a drunk on a unicycle.
---
The most well known would be the POM Pyro build, mages sheeping you, popping arcane power, casting a pyroblast followed by presence of mind and another instant pyroblast and pretty much one-shoting people. Also I saw some variations with arcane and frost with points in POM and shatter.
---
You are a dumbass if you undercut by that much. if you work with other sellers you will make a lot more money. "priced to move" only works until you've tanked the market to the point that its not worth selling anymore.
---
And that loot share.....
---
Im just very unlucky then. I must’ve done armory atleast 20 times the last few days, and I’ve only seen shoulders and helms.
---
From major cities in AUS you’ll get 180-220ms on NA servers. If you tether off your cellphone with no wifi you’ll get 240. It’s completely playable!
---
Oceanic servers you’ll have 15ms though
---
If you undercut by 1 copper on the ah, nobody panics because it's 'all part of the plan'. But bring down the price by 40 silver and everyone loses their minds!
---

Hey Bobble !! so i was playing today and one of my friends pm me and say that saw me on r/Classicwow i was ''What???'' I will remember this day forever, before we go for this run we actually have a conversation about Drop rate % and things like that, and BOOOM HoJ dropped. We managed to kill the boss but the adds after and the shock to see the items dropped made me freeze and i die to the mobs eventually. My heart was like a train in the roll time, when i saw the rolls 3 and 5 i just freak out and type OOOOOOOOOOO and leave it my chair like i was like drank 1000 redbulls, i could yell at the game, because i was yelling in real life lol.
---
After you said that if you gonna know this will happen would you give me 500 gold for the HoJ I would probably accept haha
---
I hope you have more lucky and soon get this item, you deserve man, keep up 
---

You got to DM north, go through the doors to the left of the first guard (in the grassy square thing), run all the way to the library, pick up the quest inside there for the water, you can do this SOLO. 
---
Next get a group for DM east, make sure they kill Hydrospawn (water elemental boss), pick up water from looting him, run back to DM north to where you picked up the quest. 
---
Hey presto
---
Edit: You need the Crescent key from the goblin you chase in DM east to access this.
---
If you can solo a devilsaur you're a high enough level to have no other reason to be in un goro
---
/cast [nomod,@mouseover,noharm,nodead] *spell you wish to cast*  
---
I think this works? Give it a shot. It should cast heal on your mouseover target, but if you don't have one, then it will cast on your target as long as they are not an enemy and not dead.
---
Man are they going to be pissed if they ever make it to thorium
---
You shouldn't have apologized. Guy/Gal was a tool.
---
or PhilipSoloTV....
---
yes, except if you're casting anything other than a nature swiftness heal, you're going to get bonked hard
---
Exactly this, I get so many ppl ask me why i don’t spam rejuv. 
---
Back to the topic tho, I can’t speak for priest/shammies, but druids can fully hold their own come end game heals, but most importantly you bring utility and support to the raid. You won’t be topping the heal meters, but the effect you have out weights that. There’s also a spec called HotW/NS (1/29/21) that lets u do everything come endgame: pvp/heal/tank/dps, although not fully optimized for each role. 
---
Hope this helps
---
I don't know the answer to this, but if you play around on www.sixtyupgrades.com, I think you can see how spell crit and spell damage compare in the preset equivalency points.
---
That is exactly what I was thinking.  Thank you
---
You’ll get spell pushback from the mobs hitting you and it’ll generally be a health loss.  Try using regrowth+rejuvenate before the pull instead.
---
Arcane Frost is the main raid spec.  Arcane Fire is a burst focused PvP spec.
---
If you actually mean an Arcane build that uses AM then no.  You could technically use AM on clearcasting procs to draw out your mana on long fights in PvE but there are no long fights right now(saw someone mention this in another topic earlier today).  In PvP they can cast on people trying to los and it will continue to channel otherwise sometimes people take Improved AM to deal with knockback in PvP.
---
The god damn grugs

Typical liberal gamer.
---
SKARM TANK needs to be better known. look him up on the youtubes.
---
Most Shields have integeated bottle holder so you can take a quick sip.
---
Likely just bad luck.
---
Can confirm in vanilla it required diff riding skills. My gnome warrior was rank 13 and exalted with darnassus SW and if so I could pick a mount depending on mood.
---
Decent amount. Especially on one faction (cough, horde, cough) dominated servers. We have seen before on Kronos what happens when one faction dominates a pvp server and they can't get bgs fast enough (or not at all in case of Classic). Some servers will be quite literally unplayable for one faction.
---
Killing low lvls doesn't count as honor (maybe just as kill but being a little scout with hundreds of kills is not that cool) it will probably be slightly harder to play but I don't think that much to push people to quit..
---
It's easier that people (like me) will quit due to the impossibility to spend enough time raiding and WPVP will not be funny enough to keep playing..
---
That’s exactly how it went down. And I would’ve spent that 500g in a heartbeat. Congrats on your HoJ!
---
You deserve the gold medal.

kk thanks! I'll work with him.

Obviously healers are the only ones who can’t get threat since they don’t attack. You can trust me I did naxx in vanilla
---
If your alliance you might want to go on a oceanic server ... we alliance on kirtonos are doomed lol
---
esfand the #2 paladin on the list there is the GM of his own meme guild and prios himself all the gear
---
his dps still sucks
---
Y’all are a bunch of pussys because someone says shut the fuck up and clear comms during a hardcore raiding guild sesh makes them a piece of shit lol. 
---
Have fun with your 3 hour MC clears
---
To answer your question it was almost 2am when we formed the train  and I had just smoked before doing so. And since I work nights it just seemed like something to do until I got tired enough for bed
---
Hey friend, I appreciate the concern, but I'd like to share with you what this experience has taught me.  That is, It is **way** more satisfying for the community to self-police than to have Blizzard moderate.  I actually got to participate in this guy's punishment, and now everyone knows him and what he stands for.  On top of that, he still gets to play the game as a known villain, but he probably won't be very successful in ganking/camping people anymore.  Best case scenario, he realizes the error of his ways and reforms.  I hope that happens.
---
It pisses me off that crap posts like losing a roll or posting chat box of someone being salty gets more upvotes that this. This sub is full of dramatic babies who want to cry about everything. THIS IS GOOD OC!
---
You see this location has a reference to spider webs irl
---
Ditto this guys statement. Had a BoE Skullfire Shield drop in UBRS and I wanted it as a Warr tank. Everyone rolled need, a hunter won and said I could have it for 500 gold. Told him I'm good and kept right on tanking. Unless you set up BoE rules you can't get made when everyone rolls need on a BoE.
---
bcs for some reason ppl in classic dont all roll need zzz
---
I did it at 60 and would recommend doing so. At 60, you can make more gold per hour than at lower levels, and you will have better gear and damage. Everything is easier.
---
As a warlock, with probably mediocre gear, your best option is solo Mara farming. It's pretty easy to make upwards of 40g per hour once you get used to it, and can make more with better gear. Check out some YouTube videos of it, there are tons of them. Mara solo princess/goblin farms (sometimes adding rotgrip).
---
I think all the mages had decursive installed by the time they got to Naxx...
---
The rock Elementals (not necessarily the lesser version) in Badlands drop a good amount of grey items that vendor well.
---
There wasn’t too much competition on my server, but mileage may vary
---
It's like telling the tank they have to compete with every other warrior/pally who wants off-spec gear. The amount of competition may not be more than other classes have for their items but it is far more than the tank is probably used to. Our experiences anchor our expectations and druids just aren't that common.
---
It is very much immediately obvious by the simple fact that this guy is killing Devilsaurs. The likelihood is very high, and basically guaranteed if he's 60. Not only that, but the guy is refusing to loot because you're there. I'm seriously concerned about your deductive reasoning skills if you have any hope left at all for the guy not being a skinner at that point.

If you will be your guild's main tank, I think you need to be a warrior.  If you are duo'ing with a friend, leveling a warrior is not that bad.
---
Blessing of Freedom is such a beautiful thing.
---
Is there some weird psychological factor for creating groups with "lfm" compared to "lfg"?
---
I'll be looking for a group as a warrior and say "tank lfg uldaman" or something and get no responses. If I switch to "lf4m", which means the same exact damn thing, and I can fill a party a lot more quickly.
---
the warrior tank list is a little off.
---
My, goodness learn, the proper use of a, comma.
---
there's 404 comments on this so I'm not sure if anyone said this but...
---
Two people can level mining skill on one node! It's not like herbalism where one person can pick it and whoever starts first gets it.
---
So you weren't even stopping him from progressing his mining skill if you both hit the node every time! He's bitter about losing a few copper and a stone every time he hits an ore and you do too..
---
Also, misused periods, making one sentence into two.
---
You can't compare the top rets/boomkins to the trash fury warriors/mages.
---
How do you think the average mage compares to the average ret?
---
I did a variation of this in SM arm, 3 warriors and 2 Paladins. Needless to say but the few runs we did were super quick.
---
Yea I mean his guild is very good despite him playing the meme spec so it ends up not mattering too much since most of the people there are there to play with him on stream. It’s really one of the only cases I can think of where playing ret isn’t a huge drawback to your guild.
---
It tells you when someone ignores you?

2hander tanking is viable until ony and mc. I’ve done it all. There’s a few nasty fights (baron rivendare, general drakkish, emperor when not throne kiting) that come to mind where you need a stoneshield potion or a shield to not die to crits but otherwise keep up demo shout and tclap and make sure you’re wearing plate. U only need 4k armor and 4k hp to tank 5mans. 
---
The issue is getting the gear to be hit capped... aka lionheart, blackstone, and the UBRS pieces. What 2hander do you plan to use?
---
Because I'd rather be in a guild with people who I like that clear shit smoothly and quickly. So I am comfortable respeccing arms when I'm not raiding. Same with my healing friends. This is what it requires for us to be able to raid with all of us friends/ex guildies. If we all played our fun specs we'd have about three healers, no tanks, 6 arms warriors, and 10 dps shaman. No boss is dying that way. And because we raid one night a week for a few hours max.
---
You gonna get hit hard out of bear form. Very hard.
---
Avengers Endgame
---
yes and you'll get the heal threat also
---
I saw that engineering was a recommended profession for warriors, but went mining/skinning while leveling. If I have multiple characters, does it really matter who does what? I'd rather keep the skinning skill I've built up.
