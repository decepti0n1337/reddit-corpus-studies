Please elaborate!

The RP-PvP server I was on was a ton of fun.
---

---
Our all Dwarf guild was part of an alliance of guilds who were friends in real life with the largest Horde guilds/alliances.
---
This led to the guild leaders building up mild RP stories/adventures during the week and led to large scale battles on the weekends.  
---
Nothing too scripted, mostly just a general time and place/zone.   The rest of it was up to us.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
We would just do the easier raids and never bothered with AQ/Naxx.  We had a rule you weren't allowed to read any boss mechanics in raids. Had to learn it ourselves.  Also we had to be drunk.
---
Remember the pvp trinket doesn't necessarily get you out of stuns in Vanilla.  Each class has a different list of incapacitations that their trinket works on.  On a recent private server I was reminded of this when I played an undead warlock.  I had 2 fear breaks (WotF and pvp trinket) and ZERO stun breaks.  The warlock pvp trinket doesn't get rid of stuns, not sure about the hunter one in Vanilla.
---
with a proper skill - 5 mages would rape anyone i believe. blanket cs and insane burst single target or aoe. deleting ppl. if opponent try to do anything fishy or burst - just block, absolute uncoutarable immunity in vanilla. 
---
against paladins bubbles just wait it in blocks. then cs and rape. 
---
against shamans only trouble is killing groundings, in case they all grouped you can just blink in spam novas and aoes. mage armor+dampen magic, you won't really burst them all with just 5 instant chain lighting+shock, and its all the damage shamans have, forget about casting anything, they just block, not to mention they can block instant burst aswell. and no way it'd be so insync so good mage just react on being bursted and block. you can also see what they target and mages are quite tanky to magic as i said.
---
basically with a proper play and skill mages would rape anyone.
---
I agree with this. I PvP'ed a lot in Vanilla and never was engi. People on here make it sound like you will have zero fun and get roflstomped to oblivion if you don't take engi. That's super not the case. Not everyone is going to be a High Warlord. The ones that do go for it *should* be making the sacrifices like taking engi and the like, as they are dedicated players. The amount of hardcore players is going to be higher in classic than it was in vanilla due to it being an older game, but there's still going to be plenty of casuals.
---
&gt; you can cc a mob in a dungeon
---
No you can't ;(
---
The saving grace is that SL spec is completely unviable in PVE raiding, so most warlocks you run up against will be SM/Ruin or DS/Ruin.
---
Ultimately rogues, I think. Purely because they have 5 of every CC ability plus Preparation gives them resets on everything as well. 10 Blinds, 10 Cold Bloods, 10 Sprints, 10 Vanishes. If they were organized enough they could sap 2-3 and burst the remainders, reset and repeat. Even if they didn't rely on Ambush chains they could all have 2 100% Backstab crits each (no combo point build up needed).
---
Mages, Locks, and Shamans could spam AoE to cancel the openers but I think once the fight gets started they'll all fall due to the amount of Gouges and Kicks. Mages' Ice Blocks will probably be forced on Saps or Blinds, Locks are open to CC with Blinds while pets are killed (20 seconds worth of Blind each). Shaman totems could prevent some saps but even if just 2 Shamans get sapped in the opener that leaves extra CC for the ones that didn't get sapped, the Rogues would probably follow up with Gouges to stop the mass of instant Chain Lightenings.
---
Priests can't break Blind or Sap. Warriors can't break Blind. Hunters might do well if they're dwarves (Stoneform). Paladins have no range so rogues could reset infinitely, forcing bubbles then sapping and bursting. Druids would probably be the only counter to the rogue group due to poison dispel, FF blocking restealthing, bear tanking, and travel form kiting.
---
Thanks for the detailed response üëç
---
Adjusted album and photo captions to be less angry. Sorry. I truly am hopeful that Classic turns out well.
---
#authentic
---
Dungeons are considered indoors, so entangling roots are not castable there
---
I came here to say Strath. Barron runs at 60 for the mount.
---
Sounds fun
---
Hell yea,  looking forward to this and Strathholm so much
---
I think they designed it with the idea that raid / party groups didn't have to min-max everything to the extreme to beat the content, so it was ok to have players in less than optimal classes or builds.  It's only when speed running or the race to a server first kill came into fashion that this extra focus on optimal raid setup became the norm for the elite guilds. 
---
I was part of a guild that competed for all server firsts and got about half of them,  up to Cthun and we always had suboptimal classes in our line ups.  We gave loot to the wrong guy, like thunderfury to a rogue instead of the tank.   I also think we played with less information like dps charts  etc for most of vanilla.   We did have those tools in the end, in AQ and Naxx but that was only for the last few months. 
---
Yeah, that could be fun.
---
This is in my desktop wallpaper folder now.
---
I remember doing this as well.
---
Got a message from a GM the 2nd or 3rd time and they told me they would ban me if I kept it up :(
---
I never bought the whole "flying was a mistake" nonsense, tbh. If anything, I felt that their attempt to curb it in Mists onward was the mistake, and a misguided one at that. Between that, removal of talent trees, very low dungeon count and dungeon exp, forced daily grinds for faction rep, and nerfing the power of crafting... it all came across as a simultaneous dumbing down of the game and a regression of what made MMOs interesting in the first place.
---
In optimized gameplay:
---
T1: Hunters use full set, tank warriors might use some depending on threat requirements, Shamans can use it if they get the entire set, rogues I think 5/8 is the best but can't replace devilsaur and cadavous iirc.
---
T2: Priests can use full set. Tank warrior can (but again depends on threat), hunters will use full set, sword rogues will use full set.
---
T2.5(AQ): Tanks will use parts of it for threat, rogues will use lots of it, I don't think others do iirc. 
---
T3 is pretty much amazing for all classes.
---
Blessing of judgment was a thing in vanilla wasn‚Äôt it? Except it was stronger than it is today. 
---
Then you start tossing out blinds from stealth and focus the one that isn‚Äôt.
---
This. Basically before they turned it into a bloody Tim Burton theme park in Cata.
---
Oh, I struck a cord, I like that.
---
well, it certainly USED to be, back in the days when games were made for gamers and not every teenager was a gamer by default.  The smartphone (angry birds etc)  made gaming more mainstream, so every kid became a gamer, but that also made it much more casual, and as a result complex games like mmorpg are also made more casual, because that's where the most money is. 
---
Cata made two major mistakes. They nerfed talent trees to force out the hybrid builds, and they introduced Raid Finder in a form that gave away a ton of loot which was stronger than heroic dungeons for little to no effort on the player's part. If the \*only\* thing RF did was help you assemble the raid, without the dumbed down versions or gear, it would have been okay.
---
Rogues could each take a mage/lock 1v1. I don‚Äôt understand why everyone is suggesting blowing up one person as the only start. Rogues were crazy good at 1v1. They‚Äôd all lock down their opponent and win that 1v1.
---
You‚Äôd think that someone who was brought back would know just how horrifying the abyss could be.
---
Of of the same class 
---
100% disagree, actually pretty surprised you got upvoted. having a mary sue warchief on horde was really bad for the narrative. garrosh was objectively a better character in wow
---
awwww, what an adorable fragile little soul you are!
---
&gt; Hence the automated reporting system sadly
---
&gt; And the whole loot trading nonsense.
---
Yep. Both of these are guaranteed now that we know the option of hiring more GMs is out the window. Feel sorry for people who won't play because of those. But Im definitely still in. I feel lucky honestly. Could have been worse.
---
Yes, and with even less GMs and customer support, Right Click Report and Loot Trading are here to stay.
---
Or they could each 1v1 someone and stunlock/cc kill them. Easier than trying to line up a one shot. 
---
BC without flying and resilience = Vanilla.
---
You're right. I spoke too soon‚Ä¶ He was the reason the Horde survived at all. One of the founding fathers too. Warcraft 3 Thrall is a badass. I'm talking about his actions in Vanilla. What are his achievements here? Well he helped us the player to cleanse Ragefire Chasm of Warlocks. He wanted to make peace with Magni, which is cool. But he didn't really do anything. You can write that up as Vanilla not being story-heavy, which would be true. But compare his throneroom to that of Stormwind's. The most exciting thing that happened in that room is the conversation he has with Vol'Jin and Garrosh before Cataclysm. (Which is one of my favourite moments in the game.)
---
The ONLY chance rogues have is if potions and Engineering is not allowed. I still don't think 5 rogues could take on certain other 5 man class groups ... and forget about it if they are Orc.
---
Yeah, I know. I was there. I was beta testing runescape 2 during late 03 to early 04.
---
5 rogues vs 5 cat druids.
---
I'll let you know when one finally unstealths.
---
They are top DPS from pre-raid BiS to endgame though. 
---
Personal loot doesn't change the community. It just means you won't get master loot ninja'd.
---
Reagents never bothered me. Idk why people get so bent out of shape about them. Just buy them before you go anywhere.
---
Oh yeah for sure, I love MadSeason and watch most of this videos.  His 4? part series about interesting items he has from vanilla is AWESOME stuff.
---
Hello, how was your 12th birthday?
---
Paladins can't do enough damage to Shamans. Shamans purge their seals which means no Judgements.
---
They really should have made it 10% spirit increase to make it worthwhile
---
you left out class balance and having more than a handful viable specs.
---
strictly speaking of hunters here yes. and hunter trinket removes stuns, slows and immobilizes 
---
The only specs that aren‚Äôt viable are ret and Moonkin. Small price to pay in my opinion.
---
also you can start by fuckign with them with distract until one of them slips, then toss the blinds and blow someone up....you might even get two out of that if you can get someone to misstep just right with a distract
---
Destruction for Leveling? Is that a joke?
---
Do u even wall jump bro? /s
---
What's wrong with azeroth reforging?
---
Yes
---
I remember my rogue lockpicking this at 300 skill.
---
please, do tell me about how paladins and druids are raid viable tanks, or how hybrid classes have DPS specs that are actually worthwhile to have in PvE.
---
Your logic again.
---
In vanilla they can talent for full uptime immunity from snares but even with +10% run talents and stacking run buffs a paladin can't run as fast as Ghost Wolf. GW can't break snares however like druid so is a limited escape and likely only Enhancement spec'd Shamans can use it as such other than an opening advantage.
---
I don‚Äôt think justice counts as a snare though. It just doesn‚Äôt let you move faster than base move speed. It‚Äôs not actually a slow. 
---
46% of people think this is true 
---

---
No severance pay, just a phone. 
---
Instead you have the Rammstein necklace to farm. Although I believe it's more fun to farm Strath UD than BRD. And you get some good rep with AD which will make your Naxx attunement cheaper. 
---
Thrall&gt;boy king
---
Shamans with AoE Poison cures and snares, yeah 5 rouges would be fucked.
---
This.
---
Since that's such a specific thing, no.
---
That's probably the only exception of me not attacking a dwarf or nelf hunter on sight.
---
They will get an automatic response that says they won't do anything about it. Real people problably won't even read those tickets.
---
I only remember the paladin guide using private server nonsense with the /sit for reckoning stacks tactic. That doesn't invalidate all the work he's done for every class.
---
Indeed, by that logic I would be SAVING the lives of countless gnomes or F Nelf trannies in stormwind or Ironforge.
---
I can't simply have a thought like that on my conscience.
---
One of the original devs said in a classicast interview that big layoffs happened after vanilla wow was done. They don¬¥t kick people out while they work on a product.
---
It was 50g max. Azerite just keeps going up every time.
---
Lol while it's true the tech sector went down, blizzard went way more down than everyone else
---
Actually torn now between Rogue and Priest of all things, for quite different reasons.
---
Rogues have a stronger RPG element. Lockpicking, pickpocketing, poisons etc are all cool but not as intrusive as pet management or soul shards etc. Rogues seem like they'd suit a solo player, as I would plan to mostly be. Rogues feel like they have a stronger connection to gear. Getting a new sword is awesome whereas a new staff for my priest probably won't feel as nice. My reservations come from their poor levelling experience, limited roles and how popular they will be.
---
Priest is a smooth class, easy to level and 40+ gets shadow form which is a cool ability. I like being useful, I have been a main tank in retail for ages so healing seems like an alternate take that allows me to get groups and make the difference between success and failure. Priest also has its own cool elements like buffing, mind control and so on. My main reservations with priest are somewhat restricted profession options, you kinda need tailoring and their sologame seems poor at level 60.
---
About 90% of Blizzard is not part of development teams.  There are many other departments, such as legal, esports, marketing, PR, etc.
---
Blows my mind why they just won't kill loot trading, and have no gm support for it.  I haven't heard a single person actually want loot trading, seems like most people are happy with just dealing with their own loot mistakes than have something detrimental in the game
---
Gank lowbies nonstop as revenge for the 5000ganks I recieved on private server.

---
Classic is the only thing they have in the pipeline that might help turn this mess around. 
---
I wouldn't mind if they reduced the gold cap for respec costs (perhaps a 20g cap?) but actual dual-spec would be too far imo
---
AFAIK people who were on HOTS had been distributed around to other teams in the company, unless they decided to quit.
---
But 5 Rogues cant win against hunters. there detect stealth units.
---
hunters mark and the rest is a fast finish. 
---
if the Rogues have cd is same there can do nothing. 5 traps and pets are a lot.
---
5 shamans and 5 hunters would be strongest 5 man Groups 
---
Nobody is going to beat 5 Pallies. They are unkillable. 5 Bubbles, 5 Lay on Hands, 5 BoP... yeah good luck killing that. They can dispell everything, heal, 5 Stuns, a ridiculous amount of Buffs... 
---
This is the content I come here to read.
---
Didn‚Äôt care for a warmongering douche being warchief.  Those are just my 2 cents.  Thrall‚Äôs a cool guy, eh fights injustice and doesn‚Äôt afraid of anything.
---
(The irony of wanting a pacifist ‚Äúwar‚Äùchief is not lost on me)
---
But it's not a 1v1. Locks would win no question. There's a reason rogues are trash in team fights like premade v prepare ab.  
---
Wow. thank you for making this. That was a trip down memory lane just seeing some of the guild names that I remember  from running around town, even if none of the players were personal acquaintances (yet) haha
---
Tought rogue swords was going for T2 8/8 but didn't see any comment on the post so maybe I'm wrong 
---
If we‚Äôre under the impression that this is in an arena style fight, rogues would win. It‚Äôs not a BG. They could easily CC each warlock one at s time and kill them. This is vanilla we‚Äôre talking about. It‚Äôs not a bg; there is no goal they need to work towards. 
---
Prot warriors should go for TPS gear, survival just as much as necessary. they might still use 8/8 in some cases, but you really miss out on a lot of Threat if you go below hitcap etc (which is why Band of Accueia is usually reserved for tanks).
---
Shamans can use 8/8 T1, Priests can use 8/8 T2, afaik Rogues can use 8/8 T2, Hunters have pretty good sets, and T3 is totally awesome for many people in a raid (note: not every player of the same class, even of the same specc has the same role to fill in the raid, e.g. MT heal vs Raidheal, MT vs OT etc.)
---
Dev-proposed changes need 75% voter approval, but it's not a hard-coded system. The devs occasionally make unilateral changes "for integrity of the game" and occasionally take liberties with how they enact polled changes.
---
In his rogue guide he was talking about front stabbing.  He also doesn't really do all his guides, he gets popular private server folks to help him out which is why he has weird private server shit in the game
---
Donjon Pepega
---
One factor could be the players name. We all know those moments where you decided to kill someone because they had a stupid name 
---
Haha you probably caused your raid to wipe if you were exploring while everyone else was waiting at the boss
---
5 mages
---
WAKE THE FUCK UP
---
WE CAN SHEEP EVERYONE ELSE AND FUCK YOU IN THE MOUTH
---
Not really, I did it for the loot.
---
"Go slay this dragon for the Horde!" - Thrall 
---
"Meh, leveling fishing" - Me
---
vs 
---
"Go slay this dragon for the Horde and bring me it's head and I will reward you with a trinket" - Thrall
---
"Leeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeroooooooooooy Jenkins" - Me
---
&gt; Blink
---
STOP THAT
---
It also improves the experience by letting you buy them as a different class and hand them off to your friends as a thank you, or cover someone who forgot them and stuff like that.
---
You know... community building things. This is one of the small touch things that wow has lost over the years. Most things are meaningless now. I suspect a lot of people would reply "just give them a little gold then instead wtf" but thats exactly my point. For what? the money would be meaningless with no little things like this to buy and trade
---
I am surprised there is even one person that wants to play Cataclysm again. Might as well play BFA if you want streamlined WOW. TBC and WotLK will probably happen if Classic is a success.
---
One of my favorite parts of the entire game
---
I played on The Venture Company from vanilla through WotLK.  As someone who first got into Warcraft when I bought the first game with allowance/lawnmower money in '94, RP-PvP felt like the most authentic way to experience the Azeroth I grew up with.
---
Roleplaying opportunities were readily available if you sought them out, and especially in vanilla you would routinely find partners to group with who would RP.  While there were hardcore RP guilds, it was easy to keep it on a casual "/s-only" so it didn't get too intense or burdensome.  The world PVP felt really connected to the grassroots RP as well.
---
I think in general, you'll find a more mature type of player on an RP-type server, which makes the community experience dramatically better. And I really did love world PVP (getting camped and all), both for the authentic feel of being in Azeroth and sense of increased difficulty in leveling.  It was a tough balance to maintain, and doesn't really exist anymore in retail WoW.  I'm looking forward to Classic specifically to relive that experience.
---
If you're thinking hard about RP-PvP at all, it means it's probably your niche.  It's not for everyone, but for the people who find value in it, it is amazing when it clicks.
---
Would absolutely love that. They could just add some portals or stairs to places that need it like the elemental plateau in nagrand.
---
Early TBC before everyone could fly was some of the best world pvp there was because of dailies and farming areas like ele plateau.
---
Once people started actually being able to afford flying mounts though it all died. Getting ganked? No problem. Rez behind a tree and hold spacebar. The world is no longer dangerous and your mischief has no consequence.
---
Before flying if you bit off more than you could chew you might get graveyard camped until you had to log onto a different character lol
---
Really? I have the name Leeroy on my old account
---
US or EU?
---
Nah, just one of the few people here apparently honest enough to admit they don't need to be an asshole to make a video game feel social.
---
never played on an RP-PvP server, however, I remember a particular one that was in the same battlegroup as mine back in TBC days, because it's alliance players stood out so much... and they were fucking terrifying.
---
*The Venture Co-EU*. I have never seen pvp players so organized and playing their classes just flawlessly. in a random bg, if there were 2-3 players from TVC, they basically obliterated everyone.
---
so... no idea about how mellower RP-PvP servers tend to be, but those fuckers sure as hell weren't.
---
I consider tbc to be the pinnacle of wow and although I enjoyed vanilla I will be playing classic with the expectation of a tbc server. 
---
Yeah reading through all of the bullet points in the blue post announcement back in november... Loot Trading is literally the only non-vanilla thing in there.
---
And their missions statement at the top says PRIORITY #1 is to provide an authentic experience.
---
Absolutely ridiculous. This will inject modern BS into a classic game that we all know and love. I hope they reconsider.
---
I stopped playing right after hitting 85 in cataclysm, but from what I remember, many of the zones changed a lot. Entire quest chains were eliminated, and new chains created. It might feel like a brand new experience for you. The Barrens was split into two, Silithus changed significantly, Stormwind was expanded to include a harbor (maybe this was WotLK), etc. I'm sure there are many more changes, but I didn't make it very far into cataclysm; I was already on my way out in WotLK, and I think the phasing in Cata is what finally did it for me. 
---
As for the graphics, I don't think there's a firm answer. From what I've read around here, the textures are supposedly supposed to be better. Personally, I hope they give us at least an option to toggle on the new graphics. They look a lot sharper from what I have seen.
---
I‚Äôd try to determine the best way to get a good view in said enemy capital city.  Would definitely offer assistance if the hunter stumbled during said attempt. 
---
Reason, I never got to see it when i played WoW back in Vanilla. Not sure if the hunters on my server weren‚Äôt good enough or just no one cared enough to try. Regardless i want to see this at least once during WoW Classic‚Äôs lifespan.
---
Maybe every ~6 months they could have a content patch. In that patch, there'd be a low level dungeon that fills a gap or entirely replaces Gnomeregan (kidding), and a raid that is about half a tier higher than the highest tier.
---
The problem is what to do about the PvP disparity? Pretty much any solution would compromise the integrity of the game. You could maybe match people in BGs with people who have similar iLevels, but that might make queues longer. You could scale them down, but that feels too bland and like retail. You could put them in different brackets, but how do you specify who goes in what brackets? You could lead them toward a different queue that gives better rewards, but then it just makes the treadmill longer (the same way that adding a raid onto the end does)
---
Frankly I think the only way to do it is to add content in the middle, and keep Naxx as the ultimate end of the vanilla WoW content (in terms of character power)
---
Savix just got a 30 day ban because the players he was up against in an RBG mass-reported him.
---
Maybe once you hit level 60, it automatically creates a copy of your character on the TBC server. It would also sync your character's achievements and gear and gold and such, but as soon as you stepped through the dark portal, that connection is severed and you no longer can make progress on your vanilla toon that would transfer over to the TBC server. That way you can keep your vanilla progress, while also feeling like you're transferring the same character instead of a fresh 60 in greens with the same class and name as your old character
---
What an awesome tool, ty! How long will it take until my Information is visible? Can‚Äòt see it after entering my details and filtering accordingly on the finder. The friend finder seems pretty slow curently, I hope you can fix that. Maybe just show results after entering region and server?
---
Mr. T must be 75 by now. 
---
Questing, leveling, PVP and Raids/dungeons are significantly different. 
---
Questing is more rewarding, but more difficult and slow.
---
Leveling takes a long time. You also won‚Äôt make a whole lot of money doing it.  Definitely more rewarding.
---
PvP in imbalanced all around, creating an interesting dynamic. 
---
Dungeons are more difficult. Cc and planning required
---
[removed]
---
Fuck it I'll answer since this guy seems to be living under a rock.
---
&gt;is it going to be free?
---
No, it will be tied into the normal sub.  ~$15 USD per month. You won't need to purchase the most recent expansion like retail.
---
&gt;How are you guys playing it?
---
We're not. Any game footage or content you see is from actual Vanilla 14 years ago, the Demo from blizzcon last November, or private servers that are not hosted by Blizzard and as such can't be openly discussed here on this subreddit.
---
&gt;can i download somehow the classic game just for quests?
---
Technically yes, you can setup your own private server, or play one that currently exists. I cannot tell you how to do either here. The Demo for Classic WoW is over and was limited in scope compared to what you want to do.
---
&gt;Im literally only interested in doing the Lore and quests, are they going to be the same?
---
Yes, 1:1
---
&gt;im googling some servers classic, and i find private servers, is there any i can login and just do some quests, no other people involved ,like vs player, dungeons etc, i really have no interest hitting max levels, and most of these servers saying "instant max level". Is it even worth it to download some classic wow, i guess no?
---
I can't tell you any information about these servers here, and the last part is for you to decide on your own.
---
I'll just leave this here

I eventually moved to an RP-PVP server from PvP, it felt like a better community.  Still had the rogues sniping AH's and usual PvP fun but it wasn't the same 'edginess'.  Still had the hardcore guilds pushing for raid kills, but also more quirky guilds that roll pure Druids etc.
---
I'm not an RPer at all but the world felt more alive having those players around - if it came down to playing along I'd just pretend to be a mute Gnome and use emotes :)  
---
Or roll and Undead without a jaw - perfect excuse.
---
Compared to PvE vs PvP I think it's the best of both worlds, and the population was totally fine.
---
all this talk and demand for "progressive pve" guilds, why not join a regressive guild?
---
Some people, I tell ya'
---
I cant remember which dungeon it is, but I think its a lvl 20-30ish dungeon, near undercity or tristfall glades in like a big wooden mansion. Thats the dungeon im waiting for.
---
Do you plan on doing RP?
---
Do you just want to world pvp against shitters who don't pvp often?
---
Do you just want a lower population pvp server with easier targets?
---
If any of the above three questions is 'Yes', then go PVP-RP.
---
Awesome! Just bought a 12x18
---
This is like asking why do I need a sword in an RPG when I can cook food as a side profession just as well with a knife.
---
You're not wrong.
---
That is absolutely ridiculous....Im hoping with all my being this same system of reporting doesn‚Äôt make it into live WoW Classic. Why give so many anonymous people such ridiculous power? Seems like a good way to ruin virtually anything.
---
You can't get ganked by players that are dead.
---
Makes friends, level in small groups.
---
Dungeon was one of my favorites but the loot kinda sucked! A lot of times bosses didn‚Äôt even drop any!
---
No need to be a dick, the only thing i understand in that reply was "15 USD per month". 
---
Considering in the entire lifespan of WoW, I've probably only put in less than 10 tickets and only one of those was about a piece of gear. I don't really care about the new automated systems.
---
well said.
---
There's actually something super cool about lava runs when you're only interested in the last few bosses.  The designed that dungeon so well.  It's like a mini game sneaking past mobs and taking shortcuts. 
---
I lost all my wall walking screenshots and vanilla screenshots. I'd love to have that hard drive back.

I just bought a 12x18

Those shitting on OP probably don't realize that there is no cooldown posted on the talent tooltips on classicdb etc.
---
Yup - its already bad enough on... certain... servers.

All of the people who think this has 0% chance of being abused have not seen how things are when 2019 folk play our beloved 2000s game. The devilsaur mafia alone is enough evidence of the kind of large coordinated toxicity we could see. There is no reason to add extra ways, especially when its not even blizzlike on top of being abusable. In fact I wouldnt mind if they made some nonblizzlike changes that actually PREVENT griefing instead of add extra ways to do it lol.
---
And dont get me wrong. I actually love all the trolling and griefing in classic and its part of what made world pvp great since you could actually get camped (instead of just flying away like you can now) but theres no reason to add extra unblizzlike things that ALSO can be abused lol
---
Plan on your first character being broke for a long time, unless you are very lucky.  
---
Yup - huge problem already on other ... example.. servers during UBRS runs for dalrends set and truestrike shoulders. The people who are advocating for this have not seen the current climate that already exists even WITHOUT the extra non-blizzlike ways to get away with it.
---
From what I have seen of people invited to test the early sets, things have changed.  Graphics are a little bit updated and so are some animations, but everyone has said they aren't game-breaking from the original.
---
I dont think he was being a dick at all. A simple search on this sub wouldve given you all the answers you were looking for. At least he replied.

The first time is intense as fuck when you always think you'll pull half the instance or die in the lava. Great fun!

If you are leaning PvP I would say definitely go Orc. The stun resist is a massive benefit. An easier way to think of it would be rather than 30% stun resist it could read:
---
"All opponents have a 30% chance to miss fight ending finisher moves" or something like that.
---
Because as long as you can keep moving and not get stunned you will be fine. Rogues often spend 5 combo points (Takes a min to build up) on their big 5 point stun, and you will just competely get to ignore 1/3 of those..
---
and its not just rogues. Warrior's intercept charge (game changing charge to catch up to you in combat) can be resisted, Priests blackout procs (chance on dmg to stun) can also be resisted - paladins hammer of justice.. etc. The list goes on and getting to just ignore 1/3 of all stuns is absolutely insane for pvp. Most close 1v1 matches are decided by small rng things like that, resisting 1 critical spell, critting 1 critical hit.. so a flat 1/3 denial to your opponent is HUGE. Lol probably repeated myself a few times but yeah thats how big the racial is.
---
I would never heal a troll or a trolls pet.
---
It's a good leveling spec. You don't go into destro until 40, and the destro talents will help you in lvl 45+ dungeons. You have pretty much all you need from Afflic at that point.
---

---
Im searching, nothing was clear at all to me.
---
wow, thank you again for your support! :)
---
Sometimes people troll. He wasn‚Äôt being rude. I can see how you thought that tho
---
It‚Äôs 25%, but yea it‚Äôs still insanely good for PvP.
---
Well you have to remember, vanilla was created with having the least amount of data to compute. This came down to every bag slot available and so on. They were very keen on the amount of data servers had to process, hence the limitations. This was stated in the Jon staats and Mark Kern classic cast.  
---
  
---
Now look at the dev watercooler back in summer and they're minimizing the data even further with the data/string tables. I would go as far to say that classic *may run smoother than pservers.  
---
Just something to think about.
---
8/8 T1 is so good for hunters that it's debatably even better than 8/8 T2 in some circumstances and easily better than 7/8 T2. R12/13 gear has potential early on especially for horde hunters who lack BoK. T2.5 is mostly for pvp but combined with some other items it might be better than T1 or T2 for pve as long as you have some other 8/8 T2 hunters in the raid for that awesome set bonus debuff.
---
There is also a 5% flat resist separate from the racial- not sure if it is additive or multiplicative though. Otherwise no one would ever resist a stun other than orcs
---
Ok, this time i will actually read the quests. And get the full story
---
Will be a new experience of vanilla 
---
If you remove the limit, you have to rebalance all raids, that would be massive work. They want to recreate classic, how it was. The debuff limit was not a bug, it was a technical limitation. 
---
This article has some neat side-by-side comparisons:
---
http://www.gamesradar.com/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm-comparison-screens/
---
Some zones were just given a light touch-up, some were completely remade (Thousand Needles comes to mind).  Quests were significantly changed/deleted/added regardless of the zone's physical transformation though.
---
Orc has that amazing stun resist and pet damage. Troll has a weapon skill bonus and beserking. 
---
In reality, the pet damage buff won't be noticeable, and the +ws will only be nice while you're using Rhok'delar because more or less all the best bows aside from that are xbows (and ranged ws doesn't mean as much as melee ws because glancing blows aren't a thing for ranged).
---
In a nutshell, I'd maybe recommend Orc, but they are very even overall, so if one of them is better for you aesthetically then probably go for that.
---
Right but it‚Äôs a little misleading to talk about the racial specifically and say 30%. As you said, everyone has the 5% flat resist.
---
I would go with Orc unless you significantly prefer the look of trolls.  
---
Yup you are correct-- and depending on your spec there might be some stun resist in there too, maybe survival tree? I have never played a hunter myself haha
---
Meh. I mean class balance fluctuated so much in beta and during classic, and chief design principles seem to have also varied quite a bit at different points, that it's kinda hard to say.
---
To be fair, one of the original WoW devs said that the reason hybrid classes were often bad is they just didn't have the time, and he regrets not making them more viable. The state of class design in vanilla is entirely a matter of contingency.
---
Arcanite is gold. Or something like that.
---
BC was garbage from a lore perspective, and dull aesthetically. As someone that loved WC3, that expansion ruined the game for me.
---
I rolled an alt on Venture Co when it launched. Really liked that server. Very cool!
---
* No initial purchase required, $15/mo for the sub and that's it.
---
* Yes, anyone playing Vanilla right now is playing on a private server. This sub is against discussion of private servers, so I can't recommend whether you should play or not you should play on one, but Classic should be out sometime during Summer 2019.
---
* Azeroth quests mostly remained the same from Vanilla up until the launch of Cata. A couple quest hubs were added in BC.
---
* There are no map markers for quest objectives unless you install an add-on.
---
So yeah, I'd recommend trying Classic and rolling on a low/medium population PvE or RPPvE realm. You'll be able to quest all you want without being bothered.
---
Thank You
---
I've no time for games.
---
After the shattering the Barrens was split into two zones with the Deathwing laser trench running through the middle.
---
1k Needles wasn't a water reservoir. 
---
STV was only one glorious zone.
---
Stonetalon Mountains, Ashenvale, Badlands, Darkshore and Felwood are recognizable but definitely touched by the the effects of the Shattering.  
---
Azshara was a level 50+ zone no one really went to except to kill Azuregos, drown while killing Maws and getting aqual essences to unlock Majordomo.  After the shattering it basically became a level 10+ goblin amusement park.
---
Orgrimmar was the most significantly affected capital.
---
Mulgore got sealed up like Jurassic Park.
---
i cant wait to run a full brd run with level 52 players and whipe for 6 hours only for one guy to leav before last boss
---
Are you okay? 
---
Because removing the debuff limit is essentially rebalancing the classes, and not necessarily in a good way.
---
5 rogues would get countered by:  
---
5 hunters  
---
5 pallies  
---
5 mages  
---
(probably) 5 locks  
---
I'm not sure if there would be a stable unbeatable one, it might come down to a small rock-paper-scissors core.
---
There's a lot of cool lore even in the starting zones, I highly recommend it!
---
It's everything, but the lack of haste as an attribute prevents even that small amount from mattering- you can't meaningfully stack spirit or anything.  It's just a nice perk if you are a priest, and it gives you an extra hit point and a couple mana points here and there while grinding.
---
Orc!! Back in the day I had a twinkled out Orc hunter and it was tremendous! Tons of fun, highly recommend. Orc hunter animations are surprisingly agile and fluid.
---
Priest and Warrior have talents for Stun resistance.
---
The reagent granted meaning to a buff you gave to someone else.  Removing it turned it into just another button.  
---
I don't care either way, but there's plenty of reason for these to have inventory pressure on them.
---
Cataclysm was the worst thing that ever happened to me... sniff.
---
I‚Äôm Alliance, and even I will shut this down so fast.  
---
As a non-RPer:  
---
The downside of RP servers is the random people looking to RP with your.  The upside is that you can casually chat in character about a quest or why you are in a zone or whatever, and that's acceptable because of the soft assumed RP of the server- it provides a common language that other servers replace with memes or worse.  
---
Basically, if you can tolerate the RPers at all, roll RP servers.  If you don't want to, then don't.  
---
Obviously that advice is to OP, not any RPers- those guys definitely want RP servers, etc.
---
Everything about Garrosh was cringeworthy, even back in BC. 
---
Lmao. Why am I self conscious? And I never shamed anybody? This comment is hilarious. I was just wondering why OP phrased it in a way that made it seem like it was weird. 
---
Also, I think you may be projecting. Most people self insert during character creation. It‚Äôs the people that play as girl characters that get self conscious when the self inserters assume they‚Äôre also self inserting. 
---
Also the kind of person who wants loot trading because they havent seen what happens with a real economy and limited supplies of devilsaurs, or the lengths people will go to to get their guildie's alts a dal rends set lol
---
This is what I‚Äôm hyped for
---
Even worse than that is
---
Other warrior rolls a 4
---
You roll a 5
---
Other warriors friend then reactively rolls a 73 
---
because Loot Trading is a thing even though blizzard says their 1st priority is an "authentic experience"... lol
---
Sure it'll take time if there aren't enough support staff around but sooner or later they'll get banned. If you want to throw away hundreds of hours and get your account permanently banned just so you can revoke the chat privileges from rival players for a couple of days I personally think that's a very high price to pay.
---
its additive, so people just say 30%
---
PvE troll
---
PvP Orc
---
People who want to play as a giant Minotaur, Tauren. 
---
Same, i would love if it were an OPTION to xfer to a higher xpac but not mandatory. I would love the idea to just keep my characters sitting there and ready to go, and join some other different guild a year or two down the road as new guilds rise and fall with new generations of people. This would allow for life to get in the way and have an aura of permanence that wow is missing these days since you always know a new expansion is being worked on before one is even released. Would gladly pay 15 a month for life to keep my little time capsule.
---
A mate of mine played but never got high enough level in vanilla to see this dungeon among others. I can‚Äôt wait to play this through with him for the first time! He never did any 60 content so doing full brd/scholo/brs is on our list of mandatory vanilla experiences. 
---
Hi, /u/skribsbb
---
Was their post specific to sharding outside of starting zones?  I thought it was anti-sharding in the game in general. (Which I know Blizzard is not doing per the Q&amp;A so this meme is a bit outdated at worst.)
---
The only homogenization of classes has been about buffs. Read that three times and you will understand that you are, in fact, delusional. My class lost like half of the skills and spells since vanilla. Some guy loaded an old save in the current game and half the abilities were now empty squares in the interface. The "only" homogenization. 
---
there's a huge market for vendoring the nightscape tunics for the first month or two on private server releases.  Especially when most people don't have enough gold to think about buying enchanting mats for anything resembling a profit over vendoring.
---
A little nitpick, but best ammo are from dungeons (arrows LBRS, ((Doomshot)) and bullets are Strat living Cannon master ((Miniature Cannon Balls))
---
Yes to first, second question is that engineering+whatever generally, having access to making your own ammo is an incredible quality of life and since it's vanilla, engineering in itself is just best profession overall
---
&gt;Let's get rid of the main gold sink in the game.
---
Riding, that would be aids.  Everyone would roll shamans, drood and hunters.
---
Night elf female for bow, tauren male for melee I think
---
you would be correct. its been like 14 years lol
---
The real travesty here is the clicking in pvp!!!! lol Not the pserver footage haha
---
I'm all for this so long as I get my celestial defender and death's demise title.
---
3 HOUR SCHOLOMANCE!
---
6 hour BRD....
---
Can't wait.
---
An unpopular opinion on this sub.
---
Is Naxx loot all that much better than C'thun loot? 
---
According to this dwarf rogues only have 80 base agility vs gnome rogue having 130. Thats a 50 point difference and is massive. I have a feeling it's incorrect though
---
"Paladins can't do enough damage to Shamans."
---
What about 5 paladins with 300 eng deathrays net-omatics and arcane bombs?
---
Can see shammies doing nothing but evaporate

---
Yeah, downvote my comments, thats exactly the right thing to do when someone asks a question. Have a nice day everyone. 
---
I‚Äôve played on many different kinds of servers.  I always found the overall communities to be more friendly and mature in RP and RP-PvP servers.  
---
In Classic we will have the option to use updated Water, Shadows, and Foliage Density. Classic has some slightly higher rez textures but that isn't noticeable unless you look side by side.
---
But you seem to be asking how much Cataclysm changed the old world. They wanted to revamp the experience and allow flying, so they had to change many areas just because they weren't designed with flying in mind (stormwind, orgrimmar) and they decided itd be better to update them entirely to further the story. Graphically they updated most textures in Cataclysm (the same textures, higher res, I think they just repackaged all the textures they made years before) which isn't noticeable but does help when you notice it. 
---
They used the idea of a cataclysmic event (pun intended) to change the questing path significantly, splitting the barrens and routing you through stonetalons before southern barrens for example. This was to streamline the experience.
---
Back to the environment, the old world was built for a low view distance, a world of mystery and adventure. The game nowadays is about scale, epicness, a STORY instead of an adventure, which I hope makes sense. This is why I love and play both individually, neither are perfect and I sure as heck have problems with the game now, but I still love it.
---
Why every comment gets downvoted? Jeez... im done
---
\&gt; see arena asuming for not running away 5v5 combat ie 5 friends ganking together gear/proffessions irregardless

Kind of a moot comparison, don‚Äôt you think?
---
Thrall&gt;Quilboar mob
---
‚ÄúWell... yeah...‚Äù
---
And did you pause to think about the new spells added to the game as well? Honestly, don't take my word for it. Check out https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/class-guides. Basic guides on how to play every spec in the game atm. You won't be able to find two specs that are more similar than vanilla warlock and mage. 
---
This isn't even debatable. Either you want to look at the information available and you realise that you're wrong, or you keep covering your eyes and ears and pretend like vanilla gameplay wasn't complete trash compared to later expansions. 
---
You can argue that vanilla is the best iteration of wow from a lot of perspective, but the actual mechanics involved in playing the game isn't a valid argument. I can't take seriously anyone who pretends that spamming one button in raids is good gameplay. 
---
I agree 100%, the hivemind disagrees, so you are getting downvoted. People want to justify their shitty insensitive actions to themselves.
---
excellent, thanks
---
&gt;- is it going to be free? Like if I gave them money before for the old content -  didnt i paid for the classic ones? I think im missing the latest 2 expansions, but my old expansions should cover it?
---
$15 a month. It'll be its own server, basically it's own new thing starting from scratch, but you won't have to pay $40 for a base game like you had two 15 years ago. Just pay $15 for a WoW subscription and it'll cover current WoW except for the newest expansion (we refer to this as 'retail' WoW), and it'll also cover you for Classic WoW coming out this summer. 
---
&gt;- If no, is it gonna be a monthly fee? 
---
$15, that's it 
---
&gt;- How you guys playing it? As from what i found on the internet, the game is not done yet,  and i just browsed this subreddit and seems like you are playing it, but how? 
---
Many people are playing private servers. These servers are unstable and sometimes a little shady, but people who really want their fix of old school WoW have been playing on these kinds of serves for several years now. Not everyone plays on these private servers but there's definitely more than a few who do. 
---
&gt; - can i download somehow the classic game just for the quests?
---
I don't quite know what this means and what you're asking
---
&gt;- Im literally only interested in doing the Lore and the quests, are they going to be the same? 
---
It'll be a carbon copy of original WoW, or I should say, *it'll be as close as feasibly possible*. The goal seems to be for them to make as few changes as possible, with small exceptions like the report system, the launcher for the game itself, etc., But the *goal* is to make it almost like an exact copy. 
---
&gt;- im googling some servers classic, and i find private servers, is there any i can login and just do some quests, no other people involved ,like vs player, dungeons etc, i really have no interest hitting max levels, and most of these servers saying "instant max level". Is it even worth it to download some classic wow, i guess no?
---
You can join these private servers if you want, but there is no single player version where you can hop in by yourself, that I'm aware of. 
---
&gt;I remember when the game came ( i was around 12-13 yo ) i was amazed how big are the zones and how many times i was completely lost, either cuz i decided to go nowhere to see "the end", or being lost cuz i didnt read or didnt understood what to do in some quest. After some expansions when i tried the game cuz ordered some expansions ( cuz yeah, "loyality" and fangirl  to the old blizzard ), there was a radar marker showing the quests ( where to go, etc ) - i hope they dont add this, i would love to get lost again &lt;3
---
Don't worry, they won't have the markers and hand-holding that the current version of retail WoW has. It'll be like starting original WoW all over again (or at least it will *almost* feel like it. It'll be very very similar at least)
---
Yeah, I understand.  I mean, I played several MMOs before and after WoW and of course including WoW itself for an extremely long time, so I was able to see exactly how WoW single-handedly changed the entire genre.  It's funny that as "broken" as Classic WoW was, it was still a ton better than the MMORPGs I played before it where gameplay and especially class design felt like complete "dartboard style" as I call it.
---
Then again, in those MMORPGs, levelling was practically the only thing to do, so as long as you could kill basic monsters of an appropriate level, balance technically didn't really matter.  It was only with organized raiding and dungeons replacing levelling as "the thing to do" that balance suddenly mattered for a lot of personal and social dynamic reasons.
---
Personally, I'm okay with raiding being "the thing" because to me it feels like it works off skill (relative to each time period's raids), but when I think back to Ragnarok Online days, I certainly understand some of the good parts of MMOs that have been lost.  It's a shame that these old and new designs and what they bring feel somewhat mutually exclusive.
---
So although to me raids and dungeons have always been the virtually exclusive focus of WoW even since Classic days (fair to disagree), I would have to agree that TBC and Wrath had a nice balance.  In particular, I think Wrath stuff being undertuned, intentional or not, did a lot to make the community feel better.
---
It's weird that someone like me would be interested in Classic WoW, but I just want to see for myself how this period in MMORPG history works in 2019 on a grander scale than some private server.
---
The mellowness made the play better sometimes.  You could actually learn good group mechanics because you weren't screaming and fighting with each other all the time because you had more reasonable and patient players.
---
What I'd like to see:
---
1) The strength of gear should be directly proportional to the difficulty of obtaining said gear. If you want gear that is as strong as Naxx gear you need to do something as hard as Naxx. Introduce alternative gearing methods instead of just catch up mechanics.
---
2) Difficulty should scale faster than loot. Doing a tier x+1 raid in tier x gear should be harder than doing a tier x raid in tier x-1 gear. You can't just rely on getting better gear to get better gear. You also need to get better as a player.
---
This needs to be stated before any report is done. Specifically that your entire account is at risk for false accusations.
---
A bit of internet history here. 10/10 would frost shock again 
---
You call other people dicks simply because you don't understand their replies to your questions. And you're bitching about people downvoting your comments for that. Yeah, you're totally not a dick.
---
"Fuck it I'll answer since this guy seems to be living under a rock." 
---
I don't actually think it should have to be stated. If you behave like a complete asshole you should expect serious consequences, and if you don't you're a moron. 
---
This man answered, individually, all of your questions. Then you act like a prick to him for it? Man you suck.
---
Thrall or Vol'Jin, both are badass 
---
Like how we met before in another friend, people in this sub seem to not understand the other end of the stick ie Right-click report = bad overall. I hope you're right and these assholes do get counter-banned. My main worry is not enough GMs to review the reports. This is why I suggest the statement before reporting to help reduce assholes but I know what you mean
---
I would love to be in one of these guilds. 
---
Thanks, seems like im gonna wait the official start of the game, then i`ll decide if i invest time or not, the private servers does not seem a viable option for  quests.
---
Roots are a 30 yard range.
---
Who the fuck is talking about retail?
---
I wouldn't play that garbage if Blizzard paid ME.
---
The gnomish mind control cap doesn't work like priest mind control. While priest mind control gives you direct control of the enemy target, the gnomish mind control cap turns the target into a pet you give commands to, much like a hunter or warlock. You could order them to attack a mob while you run in the opposite direction, at least.
---
if you make eye contact with a warrior and start casting entangling roots, you're already fucked. hit moonfire, since they can't charge in combat, *then* you can do entangling roots.
---
Id say, overall, i prefer BRD, but if your talking lava-emperor runs, yeah Strath is way better, with or without the reputation. Plus, something like a necklace is way less mandatory than Hand of Justice. that trinket is bonkers.
---
talented they go up to 36, im closer
---
yes, i def. understand words like ritail, sub, 1:1, demo, etc.  And i said no need to be a dick, because he said fuck, and he said i lived under a rock. Not cuz of my answers, i dont even think a single person would think i said that cuz of his answers, nevermind that were totally unclear, it was about his first sentence that said fuck you and that i live under a rock. 
---
At this point, I'm close to giving up hope for Classic.
---
Loot trading is garbage, and will fundamentally change how PUGs work. Unfortunately, automated muting, kicking and banning is FAR worse.
---
It saddens me that they can't see how hugely detrimental to the game both of these things are.
---
If you are wondering why there is downovotes: You said you had searched yourself but you post a picture of the forums, the questions you asked have mostly been answered in other posts, making your post seem lazy.

For the last couple of xpacs (playing on and off) I've played MW monk. I really like the idea of being the reason people don't die and being able to save random noobs from being owned by NPCs. 
---
But at the same time, undead frost mages REALLY call to me. I had a mage on my first trial account 13-some-odd years ago and got him to level 16 and felt bad ass having frost nova. I'm really stuck between healing (probably undead priest, maybe shaman, or MAYBE holy paladin). 
---
Any thoughts on mage vs priest (healing specs)?
---
Why would you care if you are playing casually? Pick what looks good
---
Not to mention, warriors can get another 15% resist, giving you a whopping 45% stun resist as a PVP orc warr
---
Even if there isn't a statement, once the first handful of people who get together to abuse the system get permabanned it'll cease really fucking fast.

I have a strong desire to include the collection of quests needed for dungeons through out my leveling guides.  This is on my list of things to work on.
---
There's a difference between viable and optimal. People really need to learn this.
---
Yep, its a roleplaying element. Its always been weird to me how so many people fight the RP in RPG's lol.
---
You need 10 points in prot for it, who‚Äôs going to skip MS or Enrage for a PvP spec? :/
---
lmao, Dual spec is not a huge change because you still will have to pay 50g to get that 3rd spec when you eventually need it lmao, it just saves paladins and warriors having to mindlessly farm for 6 hours a week just to go raid for 2 hours 
---
You can go 31/5/15. Although it's only 9% stun resist. Pretty good OT / PvP build I hear
---
Warlock for sure, very good 1v1 class. Can farm gold easily and can find groups easily. People love Warlocks. Enhancement Shamans are a meme at 60. Warrior is good too but requires a lot of time and dedication to thrive
---
gamechanging kek, saving 6 hours of farming every week is not game changing lmfao 
---
How bizarre. I wonder why that happens. Maybe when you take a portal they just give your char invisibility and like 20000000% run speed and cover it with a loading screen or something. Hilarious though.
---
Or know what you‚Äôre doing.
---
Bloodcraze/Enrage/Piercing Howl is a lot to give up. I feel like there‚Äôs too many ways to make gold to have to dip into two facets for your spec, but to each his own!
---
I did a big with 9 other mages. It was crazy. Way too op.
---
This was the first step towards retail. Just talk g the vanilla out of vanilla
---
Nah, Id rather have GMs handle it like classic. I don't want a misclick misassigned loot to be a permanent unfixable mistake for a game Im paying monthly for. Give me the customer service/solution Im paying for.
---
I support removing loot trading and putting it as it was in real vanilla with GM's. Thats #nochanges. But I do not support not having any GM support for looting at all. F that.

For PvE a warlock or a warrior will find an easier time finding a group, but shamans are fun too, especially in PvP. I think you should choose shaman though because that was your 1st choice and you did not want to farm soul shards.
---
lmao, retail and small QoL fixes are two very different things kid, 
---
We have to come to a compromise though.  Theres no way it will be handled like it was in vanilla, they arent putting the money into it
---
Is it? Everything recent with Thrall (Legion Shaman quests) has him bald with his Cata robes. 
---
I always wanted a gnome priest but we'll never have that in classic and thats ok i guess
---
wheres my orc priest blizzart its a small change i promise
---
Auto-dismount - cast a spell from mount instead of having to hit dismount button first    
---
Auto-downrank buffs - see lowbie and can actually buff them instead of forcing you to search through spell book  
---
2.0 Character panel - see spell damage/hit/crit in game instead of having to rely on addons  
---
AoE loot - just saving our mouses  
---
shoutout to the quiet lurkers filled with downvoting rage downvoting everyones comments lmao 
---
I've said it 100 times: Ret Paladins needed Crusader Strike as their 31 point talent.
---
They play like a class that Blizzard couldn't be bothered to finish.
---
don't give up hope! if enough people wanted it they might do it
---
what are PvPers asking to be changed?
---
undead have 5 second fear ward friend , orcs could have some other racial like a call of the elements small resistance buff or something, 
---
What is with people on the internet calling people that they do not know ‚Äúkid‚Äù? Is that a Neckbeard thing? Is it supposed to be some sort of snappy insult? Shit, at a few months shy of 41 and with the vertebra of a man older than Methuselah I‚Äôd fuckin‚Äô LOVE to be a kid again. 
---
The point of Classic is having the game rolled back to, almost completely, its first live release as it was almost 15 years ago. Personally I think that there‚Äôs nothing wrong with QoL improvements but the majority of people who are excited about Classic do not want those improvements, either because they feel that the game was harder back then (and God yes it was, and WoW was still the easiest MMORPG out back then!) or because it‚Äôs more realistic. Having to buy arrows was annoying as crap, but no one has a bow that shoots an unending supply of missiles. I wish that there were mags for my AR that never ran out of rounds! 
---
I‚Äôm excited for Classic because I did not start playing until The Burning Crusade and I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing the game as it was mostly originally envisioned. I think that will be fun, but because I do not wear the Nostalgia Glasses I think it‚Äôll probably lose its appeal after the 50th time I‚Äôve run through Molten Core and I think that it will be the same for most people, though I‚Äôm sure that there will be people who will love it and never grow tired of it. 
---
Since I started playing during TBC I remember things like Weapon Skills, purchasing arrows and running out of space in my bags way, way too quickly, and having to feed a Hunter pet so it didn‚Äôt start to hate you and bolt on you. While those things make sense they were not, at least to me, at all missed when they were removed from the game. 
---
So my point is that I can both agree with you and with the purists that want Classic to be as Vanilla as vanilla-ly possible, and that I just wasted three minutes of your time while you read this. You‚Äôll never get those three minutes back. I hope you enjoyed them. 
---
Pick aesthetics, especially if you're going casual. At the end of the day you'll have to look at that character for over a hundred hours before you even hit level cap. Don't pick a race which you dislike the animations or sounds they make (my personal pet peeve with orcs is the damn grunts they make with every damage taken or melee attack, can't stand it).
---
If you don't care about aesthetics go orc, stun resist is broken in PVP, and troll's bonuses in PVE are minimal anyways.
---
Exactly.
---
The problem is that Blizzard is so far up their own ass that they literally cannot hear feedback at all. No matter how sensible or obvious, it will be instantly disregarded because it didn't come from within Actiblizzion.
---
I always thought lvl 60's can give out max lvl buffs to lowbies, didn't realize that was a thing,  2.0 panel would be rad for calculating itemization, totally agree on auto dismount and aoe loot, as well as shared quest items ( stuff like Sidas ooz covered bag was shared, why not make everything shared lmao. these are great suggestions, shame we're getting downvoted 
---
Just because someone doesn't necessarily agree with your view points doesnt mean they're filled with rage. You sound very toxic and afraid of other opinions
---
I'm pretty sure all Justice does is prevent mobs from fleeing when they get to low health. The tooltip mentions nothing about forcing 100% movespeed (I know what you're talking about, but I don't remember it during vanilla).
---
except the "purists" don't want it to be vanilla , they want to start at 1.12 where warriors are brokenly high dps and all the fun things like savory deviate delight are taken away, as well as needing torches for dark nights and other EARLY vanilla things, (skinning sheep for wool) etc   
---
like i had stated in the post PROVE WHY small QoL changes like auto loot will make vanilla not vanilla instead people just cry out hurr go play retail as their only retort, 
---
I remember similar glitch in wotlk. It involved a DK gripping someone on a boat or something like that.
---
Also I think I‚Äôve seen something similar with failed flight path!! In both glitches you would fly through the zone in a similar manner!
---
Anyway nice video, great music! Brings back memories.
---
can you give an example as to how a very minor QoL fix would break the game? instead of calling me toxic? give me your opinion lmao dont just insult me  "downvoting rage =/= anger/rage" 
---
Guys! Get out here! You have to see this, these resto druids have been dueling since monday!
---
&gt;Magtheridon
---
They haven't retired this server yet? Last time I played retail was in 2010 on there. Holy shit. 
---
Thanks for sharing the screenshots! I remember getting into Hyjal and seeing the remnants of Archimonde, that was epic! Can‚Äôt wait to revisit all of this again this summer. And nice dragon kiting into Org, reminds me almost of the blood plague!
---
Or some people just want vanilla without any changes (or as little changes as possible). There is absolutely no reason to start proving you wrong because, it is your job to prove that those changes don't take away anything from the authentic vanilla experience. It doesn't matter how much some QoL change affects the game or not, some people just don't want them. 
---
You started a thread about a concept you clearly knew was unpopular and here you sarcastically mock the people for whom it's unpopular. 
---
Did you think you were going to control people with your pre-emptive "I'm sure I'm gonna get downvoted" thing? You weren't. You're getting downvoted for your bad ideas and immature demeanor. 
---
If you haven't played warlock before you should try it out to see if you enjoy the playstyle because it's not for everyone. If you have and enjoy it, then I'd say warlock is the obvious choice. Warriors only have a massive presence in pvp when they have gear consumables trinkets and a healer, shaman will be healing in raids.
---
Hunters aren't really any more boring end-game than they are at the beginning. The further you progress, the bigger your aimed shot crits get which is always fun, especially in pvp \^^
---
Hunters will still get invited to groups end-game even though they might not be the #1 priority unless they need a hunter for feign death pulling or something else hunter-specific, and I don't think you'll have a hard time finding a guild as a hunter unless you want to join a super hardcore guild where there are usually fewer hunter spots.
---
Hunters are some of the best gold farmers end-game. The best way is probably farming Dire Maul: Tribute using engineering to open the door and enchanting to disenchant the blues that sell for less than the item you would get from disenchanting it. You can also farm devilsaurs in un'goro or farm Maraudon although DMN is much better g/hr than Maraudon, but you don't need any specific professions.
---
I'm gonna be that Druid + warstomp
---
Downvoted because you suck at bringing ideas to the table. Too many at once with no justification to be seen.
---
My thoughts are that they're completely different experiences. I'd say try to decide which aspect appeals to you the most and then base your class choice on that. There's a huge amount of gratification that comes from being a healer in vanilla. You can give buffs to random players you see in the wild just to give them an extra edge, and you're a valued member of any dungeon group. I've traditionally played Tank and physical DPS classes since the start of WoW but I'm seriously considering rolling a priest in Classic.
---
Mages are also very valuable but more for their control abilities than support functionality.
---
lmao bring your ideas to the comment thread instead of just doing exactly as I predicted a majority of this sub would (mindlessly downvote) 
---
The question I would ask to help you pick is what do you mean by solo play when you mention the priest? Do you mean world pvp while farming, battleground queuing, no groupstuff?
---
If that is what you mean then shadow is one of the top pvp specs for 1v1 duels and that might fit you well. If you dont plan on raiding and only doing occasional 5mans you could always heal too without respeccing.
---
Rogue is awesome too though and you can't beat the ability to choose your battles and hide your AFKs with stealth haha. I'm similarly torn even just writing this reply since they are two very strong classes haha
---
There is no stupid questions, just stupid assholes who can't give proper answer.
---
lmao and yet you bring nothing to the comment thread lmao "control people" wtf   
---
asking people to give examples as to how minor QoL changes breaks the game instead of mindlessly downvoting is not sarcastically mocking people get off your high horse 
---
I felt like raiding was "the thing" in TBC and WotLK.  But you still had the similar leveling experience as you had back in Classic.  Especially in TBC you had to level through basically unedited Vanilla content.  
---
I actually think that the old "dartboard" design could still work.  My philosophy if I were designing a game, would be this for class balance:
---
1) Each specialization must have a place where it's useful
---
2) Each class must have a specialization that's useful in each place
---
3) Support classes and pure classes should have similar output in solo, but the support class should provide more benefit to the pure class in a group
---
This way, you have benefit from mixing and matching classes instead of just "get whoever brings the best damage".  You also have a lot more freedom with how you build for solo, even if you're more limited in PvP and raiding.
---
Multiple tracking would significantly effect gameplay, track hidden gives a bonus to stealth detection while active. Not only that but having a full radar instead of a limited radar absolutely changes how ganking would play out.
---
Unless you meant like herbs/ores/treasure, which still would effect competition for these things.
---
Human Hunter - definitely a rather weak combo for hunter but it would cause the need for hunter trainers in stormwind/goldshire which would effect launch (Nelfs and Dwarves being able to reasonably do Elwynn). Certainly not gamebreaking but does effect gameplay. Obvious effects for horde rogues/druids. 
---
Gnome Priest - effects gameplay for horde mages in particular (shatter (yes i know they can dispel)) every class with a slow/root affected as well, not saying its a good choice but inevitably if you give the option some will take it
---
Orc Mage - even with blink removing stuns this is impactful (rng stuns, short stuns like charge), honestly doesn't sound like I would personally play orc over ud mage but in premades with 3 priests for fear dispels it wouldn't surprise me if orc could be better
---
Dual spec - changes wpvp dramatically, very few if anyone would run around in their pve specs
---
Trackable (mailbox, innkeeper, repair etc...) - pretty inconsequential, might very slightly change social dynamics (for people who are bad at googling)
---
3+ stable slots - Niche pets would become more relevant, I could see something like a scorpion being pulled out if a hunter is having particular trouble with a paladin (for the rng cleanse on viper)
---
15m+ buffs - likelyhood of encountering a non-paladin with the buff becomes higher in pvp (unsurprisingly bad for horde), very niche effects like lower downtime too
---
My take: Only Trackable mailboxes (etc...) actually niche enough for me to not care
---
Warlock is pretty sick
---
I disagree. I would've 100% chosen horde but all my friends and family played alliance so I've had to stare at boring humans/nelfs/gnomes etc for the past 15ish years. Totally worth it. There are so many more factors to race selection than which one you like the look of.
---
RFK, RFD, ZF, ZG, AQ20 are outdoors.
---
Iirc it was "in the game" alpha /beta and they removed it. 
---
You're right, make it 20 or 30 a month and get rid of the cash shop. 
---
How many fucking hours of entertainment do you expect per dollar spent? At 15 a month it is the best bang for your buck you're going to get. Say you don't play much avg 2 hours a day thats 700 hours of entertainment for your 240 dollars. 
---
I keep seeing people mentioning vendoring leather. Won't there be a market for leather on the AH? Are we anticipating such a massive oversupply of leather from the wave of people levelling up that vendoring will be the most profitable? Back in vanilla I took skinning but I made some money selling the leather to players. Just wondering what the thought process is behind vendoring it instead. Forgive my ignorance!
---
Switched from ally to horde cause of friends, because of this video, my first 60 was a troll shaman. I regret nothing and will be doing it again come classic
---
vagash
---
Yep. That's the saddest thing about it. They new melee specs needed an instant attack to feel right, which is why every single spec has one... Except Ret paladins.
---
Their reasoning was that they wanted Paladins to feel "different", and they certainly achieved that by making the only melee dps spec that feels like waiting for a bus.
---
It's missing that vital interaction where you hit a button and get the instant gratification of seeing the big hit, which even Shaman (who have 2 caster specs) have with Stormstrike.
---
So aggressive.
---
Have you actually read 1984? If not, I strongly suggest you do so.
---
Oh, so that's what the flavor text in Hearthstone is all about.
---
Rogues trying to all ambush a single mage would get absolutely obliterated by 5 Mages AoEing. 5 CoC and 5 Blastwaves alone would kill the entire rogue team.
---
Shadowfang Keep?
---
I think lag won tbh
---
how was 1.1 the first step towards retail? 
---
I just get this dark feeling that Athene or a few others will somehow use a leveling exploit and hit 60 within a day due to some shitty bug from legion moving to classic.
---
Why would it? There are like 20 people working on it anyways.
---
People want Classic because its Vanilla. Changing shit is stupid and antithetical to the point of releasing Classic in the first place. Also your comments are insufferable and you should feel bad
---
Small QoL fixes TM
---
I never really got what blizzard was doing with Pallys.  One of the more iconic lore based class holy warriors, and they basically turned them into healing bots.  They should have 2 trees: Ret and Prot, with Prot being based around tanking with 2h.  Zero heals for pallys outside of LoH.  Everyone I knew who rolled a pally in the first few months of wow though they were going to be holy tanking warriors.  They tried to tank everything and were garbage at it.
---
requiring light sources was never a feature in the game. a vanilla designer even said on his stream it was never even an IDEA to begin with, they just wanted night to change the mood. not impact gameplay
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I want the game made and I want it made right, but I‚Äôm more pissed about the workers being laid off.
---
Orcs are better unless your pure PvE.
---
Nets just snare them and arcane bombs only work on beasts
---
???
---
Well for some people there is no need to bring any new ideas to the table, the ideas are already there... You know... In a vanilla.... The game some of us want...
---
I justified my actions in my second sentence. Learn to justify your opinions: provide reasoning behind why you think a change would be beneficial. If you do that then people will be receptive and engage in discussion.
---
Vanilla and small QoL fixes are also two very different things kid.
---
Are you?
---
2. Engineering can be very good for money making since you can farm DM Tribute, and sappers are good :=)
---
Also not correct, at least from my priv server experience. It is your pet, but you cant order it to do anything, it just follows you
---
If you have a slower paced play style rp servers might definetely be your thing. The really hard core types are going for non rp servers. 
---
Don't worry about rp. You don't have to rp if you are not interested. Just make sure your character has a lore friendly name.
---
So nothing like backstabber, xxshadowhuntaxx etc.
---
Also you shouldn't interupt players who are rping if you don't rp yourself. 
---
That's all.
---
This is something interesting to think about, never thought about a leveling bug particularly.  I feel like almost every expansion has had someone find a way to cheat the leveling process though. Once a bug like this was discovered im sure it would entice people to try new and unique things looking for more bugs as you implied. That   I am looking forward to.
---
Frankly if you think these are "Small QoL fixes" maybe just play retail.
---
What do you even mean? Respeccing is literally the biggest money sink in the game.
---
Alterac Valley
---
Resting at an inn is all I can think of. 
---
Or camping a chest/rare npc and having a slim chance of it being there when you come back from your AFK.
---
Your definition of game breaking is weird, what does it mean even?
---
And atleast one of these "small QoL fixes" are not small, while i would not define it as game breaking it does bring with it a clear distinction compared to vanilla, and solely for a "small QoL fix"
---
Dual spec = Shift the role balance between dps/healer/tank heavily and also makes the shift inbetween pvp and pve far more versatile
---
It takes some of the "speciality" out of your role now all priests are both holy and shadow or holy instead of being a holy priest, now most have a pvp spec lying around making the pvp scene very differently. If you raid you will be smashing bgs even harder then before since now you dont have to spend 50g every time. There wont be any holy priest, just priests.
---
&gt;Multiple tracking at once, (Literally causes NO HARM)
---
Like tracking herbs and mining at the same time?
---
&gt;Longer than 15 min buffs (still use reagents just longer than 5-15 mins
---
Which ones? And why? It makes sense that not all buffs have a super long timer or the exact same minute they all wear of. 
---
Raging at people is not a good way to start a discussion.
---
For PvP Orc
---
For PvE Troll
---
But both work in any situation.
---
nothing was ever the same again...
---
Definitely not fishing because the devs didn't realize until TBC that people like communal fishing. What a revolutionary idea. Social fishing.
---
Welp, not in Vanilla, the game where everyone's cast and splash sounds are audible to everyone at pretty much the same volume level, making fishing a lonesome trade.
---
&gt; AoE loot - please save our mouses
---
I really really never liked AoE loot, how can you loot several corpses at the same time? Its already hard enough to accept that boars dont always have a heart, lung, liver etc. 
---
But the others I can really get behind, for exmaple: I used to have several marks of the wild ranks and it was just a fuzz, why would my character not automaticly chose the strongest possible buff?
---
&gt;Shared quest items - I want to play Classic with others in my party. Without this anyone that cares about efficiency is forced to play solo and view every 'friendly' character as an enemy that slows you down, not a welcome ally in questing
---
This so much, its almost a exp trap staying arund and trying to grind some quests out. I'm going to try to have a list for the worst of them as I'm playing 100% of ingame time with someone else. I cant imagine when theres 3+ in your party.
---
Oh please, don't ruin my game called World of Warcraft because you have a expansion launching. Don't make it in tune with a fucking lich king incoming that controlls fucking undead, just let me rush my ass over to my trainer so i can be complete with the game allready.
---
The hypocrisy in your comment is fucking insane LOL
---
Ahaha, I love love *love* threads like these because they're such moron bait.
---
You really get to see who the knee-jerk adolescents are. Learn to read people!
---
&gt;Little afraid that farming shards could get old fast though..
---
Only if you never do it. Worst case scenario you'll make sure to end all raid trash with a soul drain
---
If you went overboard like me its quite a lot of fun. I'm not sure how many i summoned once but I can still feel the boyish awesomeness when the raid leader and someone commented on ventrilo for the time i saved for summong so many. 
---
Also its kind of easy to destroy them if you need backspace or use them with shadowburn so its easier to farm too many then too few. Its really disappointing to whisper a warlock for a summon and they go "no shards", especially when the raid is starting soon and you really wanted to smash the dps meters and dont want to miss dm buffs.
---
I‚Äôll only focus on one of these things you have listed. I also have to state first, if i had it my way Classic WoW would be completely No-Changes down to patch progression. However i will be happy (for the most part) with whatever we get. So I definitely dont agree with any of your proposed changes.
---
To my point, Duel Specs....This changed the game far more dramatically than most realized. 
---
First off, your play style choice isn‚Äôt as permanent. Granted plenty of people farmed gold to change every week, i also knew people that refused to waste the gold and became pure masters of said spec. Duel Specs also made roles less defined in raids. This is because when duel specs came out you would constantly have people flip-flopping main specs because they would get frustrated or could not remain decisive.
---
Second, it made people farrrrrr more entitled to lie about off spec for rolls or just generally feel more entitled to off spec loot (Had a couple nasty rl friends that were like this when duel spec became a thing.) 
---
Finally, spec mastery. I kinda touched on this in the first point actually. What I mean is when duel spec came out i feel like most people were suddenly ‚Äúalright‚Äù at two specs and master of none. 
---
Which one is that?
---
Playing the AH all day is the first thing that comes to my mind.
---
Did someone list a bunch of rune cloth and missed a 0? Well you now can profit off their mistake. 
---
I guess staying on D in a tower is mostly afk until enemies show up
---
Kuz in beta it was more rp oriented /s
---
At an old job I had I found the most productive thing i could do while at work was to farm humanoid enemies in whatever zone i was leveling in at the time. Got xp, cloth, gold, boe greens/blues/purples, and a surprising amount of recipes. 
---
Frost Shock.
---
The flavor text is, "FROST SHOCK!"
---
Woosh 
---
Ahahaha well that makes sense 
---
A.k.a.: ‚ÄúLol, I was actually just trolling!‚Äù
---
There's a big difference between Cata and anything from Mists onward.
---
[the numbers dont lie](https://youtu.be/WFoC3TR5rzI)
---
Hi, /u/FormalSwordfish
---
imagine having hope for classic at all LUL
---
You mean group buff fam. ;)
---
old school runescape also has decent developers you knob
---
Have they even announced servers for classic? Pretty sure they haven‚Äôt. 
---
If you‚Äôre playing day 1, then balance / ratios and population doesn‚Äôt matter. Find the server your favorite guild or streamers are going to be playing on, and play there. 
---
Buddy do I got news for you...
---
Zinzilver still has few quality videos of vanilla raiding in YT.
---
Madseasonshow is by far my personal favourite of recent nostalgia stuff.
---
Yeah, by "dartboard" I meant how the devs in the Korean MMOs would design these crazy classes with all kinds of crazy buffs and debuff or other things. For example, in RO, you had a Merchant class that could literally spend a little bit of money to do a massive melee hit, and Alchemist, one of its promoted classes, could create a homunculus (a pet class at the time was amazing) and throw potions for healing or damage all using materials gathered from monsters.  The Bard/Dancer classes, promoted from Archer and gender-locked, could cause all sorts of buffs and debuffs that were actually useful even in PVE such as gradual regen, attack speed slowing, silencing, etc.
---
However, in WoW raids, mobs would have to be immune to stuns or other wacky debuff or they'd feel trivalized even for their time.  That's the thing about dartboard design: When you don't have to care about balance, you have freedom to do whatever without much consequence as long as it's funny enough for the players.
---
What you propose does sound good on paper, and sometimes I wish WoW and other games committed more to that, but there are a couple significant problems from that concept.  One is you're practically **required** to take 5 different classes just for their one unique buff/debuff/skill.  Another problem is really with Support classes in general because the "Pure" classes then have to be tuned around being with Support or else they're overpowered with the Support, which then makes those players feel weak any time they don't have a Support class.  You could make the Support low so it doesn't fluctuate so much, but then the Support player feels weak or meaningless.  In a game that's just about levelling, however, it doesn't really break the game to have Support classes that allow you kill monsters faster or take on a higher-level monster, so that's why I feel like that design only works in those old, open-world games.
---
However, all that might not be the end of the world and totally game-breaking design if the game is designed appropriately to make all players happy.  The reason I hated Classic and it was a nightmare for me much of the time is because I levelled as Rogue and then Feral Druid and loved it, and it went totally fine.  Then all of a sudden I'm just shoved into a pigeonholed corner by the community with no warning and inexplicable contempt.  The game just suddenly changes because the devs were too stupid, or had too small of a team, to support their own game appropriately at the time.
---
I work from home so I will literally be doing this all day. It depends. I have big chunks of free time during the workday so for me its raw leveling and doing tradeskills mainly. 
---
Tradeskills in particular are seen as huge time sinks when you are leveling your character; But I count it as neutral time if I get to farm cloth and do my tailoring/enchanting leveling while I work.
---
I‚Äôm real torn on this and what kind of experience I‚Äôd have the most fun doing.. I haven‚Äôt touched private servers and obviously it‚Äôs been like 10+ years since classic.  As much as I like the idea of taking my time leveling being part of a top server raiding guild as quickly as possible sounds the most fun to me.  I can always take my time with an alt.
---
What rs3 players are you talking about lmao. Maybe the 3 people that actually still play rs3 said that, sure, but i can guaran-fucking-tee you that when eoc was first coming out there was riots literally every day for a month because people fucking hated it lmao. Nobody at the time wanted it, hence why osrs has a much higher population.
---
Having decent devs that actually add real content to the game and not mtx trash every week also helps alot. 
---
this is literally why eoc exists. 
---
Scholomance was easily my favourite dungeon. It was so easy to accidentally pull an extra group, and with the mix of humanoids and undead, there was a lot of CC to be done between a Mage and Priest in the group. Clearing trash could easily turn hectic, and that made it fun.
---
Oh, and [this ring](https://classicdb.ch/?item=22433). If I can get this to drop again, I'll be happy.
---
1. most of players were Alliance back then. Which means more downvotes than upvotes
---
2. and since you are horde, most of the players would put you in the place of the criminal, not of the victim. You are well-known for that randomly sapping people in Stranglethorn Vale for no reason.
---
21/30/0 with martyrdom, uninterruptible healing and the talent to make you auto heal when crit?
---
Let me start off by saying I haven't played priest in vanilla, but I'm gonna when classic hits. I have the same question as you do, and I have thought about it a bit. So these are my thoughts.
---
Disc is best for PvP. Priest PvE healing should be VERY doable as disc. I've healed as shaman and druid - both of which are absolutely fine. However I always envied priests as they have arguably more utility in their base kit and most notably fade. So in my mind priests base kit is better suited to PvE healing anyway.
---
As for talents, there are a couple that I think are crucial for healing. Holy: Divine Fury and Improved Healing. Disc: I guess every priest build is going to have at least 11 points in disc.
---
The remaining points can be spent in deep Disc for all round PvP / PvE healing. Or in deep Holy for more PvE focus. If your gear allows it, you can get blackout + silence in shadow for more aggresive PvP support (at the cost of some healing power). Another option is smite spec (~32/19/0) which will give you more holy dmg at the xost of Improved Healing. Like I wrote earlier, coming from shaman / druid, I feel it can be fine to sacrifice some healing efficiency talents in order to get more PvP or overal utility.
---
So that might be a lot of opinion for someone who never actually played a lvl 60 priest. I am very interested in more experienced players' take on this 
---
Can you link the build? 
---
mine too, and I hated when he was refusing to spawn, because he was hidden somewhere in the world. I remember that I decided to hold on that quest for some time, and get some horde elders. And, in orgrimmar, instead of getting an elder, I got that \[Elune's blessing\].... of course, I forgot the elder. And when I found that out, it was too late...
---
Thanks for your input. You are right about the base kit. 
---
Can you link your build? 
---
By solo I mean I plan to play by myself mostly. May join a guild but not looking to go out of my way and do group content. 
---
I've always suggested that we all pick the first 3-5 realms from top to bottom when the game launches. This was we can be certain that *most* of us here will congregate between the US/EU realms and have a higher chance of running across each other. I mean why not?
---
Paladin is the clear choice because Horde is scum
---
I actually found the agro seal an judgement to be nice for tanking smaller groups. the aoe agro was definitly not as good at when it got changed to the agro buff,though.
---
for completness I can only speak about the leveling phase as I was not tanking 60s inis, because of my absolute trash equip vs actuall "good" (for that time) equipped tanks. Good old strat *raids*
---
Check out the bottom end of [this list for the higher population realms and check wowwiki for lore about their names](https://web.archive.org/web/20080804073151/http://www.warcraftrealms.com/eu_realmstats.php?sort=Total&amp;PHPSESSID=60d1dbaba3b539bad340045173eca569).
---
For general hordiness Frostwolf is likely to be a good pick for pvp-realm players, it's named after the clan of orcs that did not drink Manaroths blood during wc3 and went uncorrupted. For a pve-realm doomhammer is popular which is the surname of Thrall's mentor and the weapon he was given by him.
---
and here is my character I created shortly before cataclysm:
---
[http://www.warcraftrealms.com/charsheet/130268112](http://www.warcraftrealms.com/charsheet/130268112)
---
I remember that guild, was really good one. Unlike previous ones I've been getting in vanilla, that kept getting drama's or falling apart... this one was quite good, no dramas even after wiping the first cataclysm boss 30 times and then disbanding raid, there was still no drama and no mass quit.
---
Now, today, I've just noticed that it was actually "the Artic fox", not Arctic...
---
and, on that character, I remember. Shortly before patch 4.0, I was leveling on that 5x range, and did Blackrock Depths or Spire or something. When I didn't need an item, I used to click Pass. But, an item named \[Greed\] dropped, so I clicked Greed, and rolled 99, winning it and gaining the \[Greedy\] achievement.
---
And, I guess the item still sits somewhere in his bank... though I've lost that account, unfortunately............
---
See, this is the only true answer!
---
Good luck champ, hope u didnt buy 2d ago. At least wait untill the layoff shitstorm has crashed the price further
---
Definitely read The Legend of Stalvan in Duskwood. A very succinct yet unnerving yarn.
---
For most people trying to level decently fast, it should take about a week of play time, but depends greatly on your class and game knowledge.
---
As for raids, no word yet, but MC was open on launch. I personally hope blizz waits a little bit so I can enjoy leveling without falling behind.
---
Top comment this month. I salute you
---
People who power levels that fast don't really like WoW's essence, take time to level, it is by far the best from Vanilla 
---
Something I noticed during WoW's original run was that servers named after popular characters (arthas, illidan, etc) were *immediately* overpopulated with a huge queue to get in.
---
I played on Silvermoon (US), for no reason in particular other than it was the one I happened to click on.
---
I'd go with this [spec](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGsMboZfVtoc0ax). You can't get both Power Infusion and Spirit of Redemption, and Spirit of Redemption is much better for group PvP. The only significant weakness of this build in PvE is that it doesn't have inspiration or the bonus crit to proc it so it is somewhat weak on tank healing. No problem, just get assigned to raid heal most of the time. If you use prayer of healing much at your content level you can swap points into the improved talent.
---
I actually greatly prefer the way paladins are to some generic spam 1 class
---
\&gt;Cast frost bolt
---
\&gt;cast shadow bolt
---
\&gt;cast crusader strike
---
Thank god your not a developer
---
You‚Äôre*
---
Ugh why do you people push class homogeny so hard
---
Why not just play retail wow where every single class is 100% indecipherable from each other?
---
\&gt;This class is missing something every other class has
---
\&gt;Why not make it and give every class this abililty
---
Now your battle for azeroth
---
I make more money than you\*
---
No then he would just stance switch and intercept.
---
The correct solution is moonfire to prevent charge, feral charge to make him unable to move and get away a little and then root.
---
This is classic wow, rogues do not run from druids.
---
https://i.imgur.com/HMrkEno.png
---
This might help. The numbers in the bottom right quadrant are the number of days you'll need to hit 60 based on your **Played to 60** and **Hours per day** data.  
---
Actually there is word. Raids will be available on day 1 as was described in the Classic WoW panel.  
---
People who power level like whatever they like. Vanilla was never about pidgeon holing everyone in to the same mindset. It was about allowing many different types of players to exist in the same world. You have no right as a player to say that I don't like WoW's "essence" just because my play style doesn't match your own.  
---
OH MAN I CAN'T WAIT TO GET BACK TO SCHOLOMANCE  
---
\*55 minutes into the first run that hasn't even opened the gate yet\*  
---
oh god I never want to come back here again
---
This is a great example of why the Classic servers should be named after the Bronze Dragonflight: There will be no faction influence via server name and thus it will help avoid faction imbalance.  
---
Maybe [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent)
---
The only thing I could ever accept AFTER Naxx would be a level 60 version of Karazhan. Mainly because it makes sense with Atiesh and because the raid is already in Azeroth.  
---
I would only like if there are very few upgrades in there though. Maybe some really good offspec items for classes like feral druid, ret paladin, moonkin druid, etc.  
---
Time wont be issue but I like to be good in solo.. So it's Warlock vs Shaman for me now üòÅ Warlocks most likely thanks 
---
I like the idea of shaman in PVP but they don't really excel in other aspects of the game expect resto. So this time around gonna rolm Watlock most likely 
---
Pretty sure playing on streamer servers or - if there will be any - mainly hardcore servers might not be the best experience for most people. But yeah, they haven't released them.
---
Assuming there will be cross-continent sharding? Huh?
---
This. While I find cool having the server named with my favourite characters on a faction I will play, there might be a faction imbalance.
---
Can‚Äôt wait to kill your warchiefüòò
---
Quality picture, gj op
---
That's an amazing list you found there, buddy. Will check that out. Though I have to agree with u/Sawyermblack that picking a server named with a name appealing to one of the faction more than the other may not be the best thing. But hell, looking at the list, there are some enormous faction rations, like with Silvermoon 5,8 Alliance to 1 Horde...
---
5 warriors OR 5 warlocks would be equally difficult.
---
July 16th.
---
See demo hints.
---
Another comment. How are the numbers in the list so high? Wasn't there a 3K cap?
---
I'd go with RP-PvP just becuase I fear blizzard activision will introduce sharding into Vanilla, RP servers tend to get escape that
---
weird flex but ok
---
iirc Ret Pallys weren't given much love in vanilla due to lack of feedback. Ret simply wasn't being played so it got pushed to the back burner in favor of more popular specs due to lack of time. Kevin Jordan went into it a bit on Classicast.
---
Did any class have aoe abilities?
---
Petty gets petty

&gt; martyrdom
---
[This is](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGcV0oZf0tIc0Vx) the old old 21/30/0 specc, although I've seen posts on here recently about renew actually being trash, someone did the math
---
Shaman is the clear choice because Alliance is lame
---
Nothing is more lame than living in a hut in the middle of a barren wasteland
---
Soon‚Ñ¢
---
Sorry struggling to on mobile
---
Nothing is more lame than being a bland, uninspired faction that rarely ever has internal conflicts and is too afraid to get its hands dirty
---
Its this thread again
---
You just described a civilized culture 
---
I just described something that's really boring in the context of Warcraft
---
There are many guesses!
---
Also please spell check!
---
13 points in disc is required in virtually every build to get 15% mana regen. As most priest gear is heavy spirit it becomes a no brainer.
---
Arthas... the best character in Warcraft 
---
Blesses recovery is more important than spell warding. Against a rogue it is a constant trickle of health.
---
Because these are for single-target buffs. Having to spend money every single time you want to buff one single person is ridiculous. With the group buffs its fine because you cast it once every 30 minutes or whenever there's a wipe, and you don't need to cast it on every single person.
---
*No game rules forever, my son...*
---
3k is the number of concurrent players. Those figures will be unique characters seen, likely at level 40+. Which is a good indicator of how active a realm is.
---
*begets
---
As long as it's completely different from TBC kara i'd be fine with that.
---
[This would be more accurate]|(https://lollinks.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/thrall.jpg)
---
It's active characters, not concurrent players. From the page:
---
&gt; The data is limited to only characters level 10 and up that have been seen in the previous 30 days.
---
Grim Batol! We have no Aq40-Naxx level 20man raid.
---
Says something that is a fact.
---
Posts evidence.
---
Gets downvoted.
---
This community is pathethic.
---
He also took out the biggest threat perceived on Kalimdor before AQ.
---
He ordered the horde to go kill Onyxia, because she was too close to Orgrimmar and the different races of the horde.
---
Ok, but that must mean that the profit calculation of 4s21 per tunic, as given above is not true.
---
A quick check learns that vendor price for thick leather is 3s. so a tunic in raw materials would vendor for 7x3+ 2x5 = 31 silver, and the completed product sells for almost 60 silver.  That is indeed a fair margin and a reason to buy up leather that would be vendored by leveling skinners.
---
Yeah they returned for about a week before they realized that the game is shit and left

How often do hunters find themselves doing melee damage?
---
Do you mean - did any not have aoe? I think they all have some form of aoe. Priest is quite bad for aoe you have to spec Holy Nova.
---
Does the version of vanilla we are getting have a mass loot option or do we loot each dead mob individually?
---
All my friends stood in fire and died. I hope they don't come back. BTW looking for new friends.
---
First off you aren't the first person to bring this up nor will you be the last. Second, one of the items you listed Blizzard has already stated is a hard no. Third, it isn't our job to convince you have already made up your mind to change. It is your job to convince others. Fourth the whole point of these servers are to recreate what was (1.12), not what could have been. So because of that logic any change that isn't a required is game breaking because they break that core concept. This is not classic+ nor is it classic remake. It is to be here is 1.12 as a moment in history but we would rather you play BfA. 
---
I never played Horde. Is getting to Molten Core a bit of a nightmare for this faction - in terms of journey time?
---
New lore is so... complacent? It doesn‚Äôt seem to mesh anymore. 
---
‚ÄúNo king rules forever my son. ‚Äú
---
Oh, they shit across the lore in BC.  Changing the history of WoW forever. 
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure the ilvl of 100 was placeholder ilvl until they could find what it actually would be implemented as.
---
Dunning-Kruger is that you? 
---
Anyone else not played retail for a very long time and massively excited for Classic?
---
Is anyone really arguing it will be. If they are that's a minority. People want to play it because it feels like a real world. You recognize people from both factions. Everyone is grounded so there is always danger. Basically every zone in the game is active. Classes had completely different playstyles. They are just two different games and it's a matter of opinion. Obviously McConnel likes the direction Wow has taken. They aren't making these servers for people like him.
---
What's the name of the first song?
---
Nobody knows if the raids will be open on release, but I would say it would be a good assumption.
---
Getting to lvl. 60 is somewhere between 5 and 15 days of /played where both ends are extremes, normal first time is probably 10 days. If all you do is grind mobs and quests it is faster than dungoens and dieing to PvP in STV. Now assuming 12h play per day and 10days of /played, that's 20 days to max level.
---
Do not forget transmog and blizzard pet\\mount shop, just cosmetics bro, wouldn't affect your gameplay. 
---
Are many people really arguing it will be? If they are that's a minority. People want to play it because it feels like a real world. You recognize people from both factions. People aren't just a random person who might as well be an NPC and you don't even bother to look at their name because you will probably never see or talk to them again. Everyone is grounded so there is always danger. Basically every zone in the game is active. Classes had completely different playstyles. They are just two different games and it's a matter of opinion. Obviously McConnel likes the direction Wow has taken. They aren't making these servers for people like him.
---
Their stock is still worth more now than it ever was when wow Was at it highest sub Numbers in wotlk - blizzard/activision Hasnt really lost anything
---
What you do in the back alley is your business.
---
‚ÄùBla bla bla, Wotlk wasnt great, it sucked, bla bla bla‚Äù 
---
Nonsense. 
---
Trade stock options
---
Don't belittle other people's play style. 
---
I don't know why people feel such a need to power level. I'd like to be 60 by the Christmas holidays realistically.
---
I think 5 locks as well. That or rogues.
---
Anyone is free to do wathever they prefer, I don't really care if they play 20h per day just to hit 60 in 1 week, but I'm sorry to disagree, I'd rather have a healthier playstyle. 
---
When the game is going to get released?
---
You can 15 man MC with the right 15 people in the right gear. It is going to be a slaughter if 40 tryhards get together.
---
Terrible idea, you miss out on all the rep. 
---
This was such a non-issue that I forgot it even existed. The reagents were dirt cheap.
---
I like how people always point out that Wotlk was the beginning of the end
---
I'm always thinking 'bitch it was also the peak of greatness
---
Easy, do you want to be grouped up with a bunch of dwarfs and gnomes
---
Or do you want to slay them
---
This sort of makes me hopeful for content past Naxxramas. I'm unsure if that's a popular opinion with the #nochanges crowd, but I'd want nothing more than a OSRS-style approach.
---
By that logic Classic is gonna fail chief :^)
---
Ret pallys just sucked dps wise until TBC when they got Seal of Blood (Horde only, Alliance ret still sucked). They were fun in PVP though at 60 with Hand of Justice.
---
"Wah retail wow wah" 
---
? The releasedate is slated for next summer.
---
How is paladin 1v1?
---
How was faction balance?
---
Every game will die eventually lol. If classic is amazing for 2 years has it failed?
---
Funnily enough the post is trying to take a shit on BFA compared to classic (Note the corners)... It's just a really, really shit meme all round.
---
The non-smoker, who always has a smoke. 
---
No mass loot
---
Yes, and A Brave New World as well. Comparing WowHead maybe, possibly using my Google search history for advertising influence to a police state is a little ridiculous though.
---
"No my son only the light of Classic WOW before you..."
---
Hard pass. Too major of a change. 
---
Careful. Some people seem to think that Classic will be the only game for the rest of their life.
---
&gt; RP-PvP felt like the most authentic way to experience the Azeroth I grew up with.
---
It's the first time in years I've heard someone echoing the same sentiment that some level of RPing was the organic choice for OG Warcraft fans, but I remember it was commonplace back then.
---
I played on a non RP PVP server in EU and every second guild had an explicit "RP is not mandatory but welcome" disclaimer on their recruitment posts. I don't believe that's a thing anymore.
---
I hope that doesn't mean that tokens are in the game because at that moment I'm out. I assume tokens generate a lot of additional money for Blizz and if you ask an accountant, he for sure would vote to implement it in Classic...
---
Flip a coin
---
Rogues have an aoe that hits only 1 extra target on a 2min CD
---
I think they were using a theoretical 'purchase price' for the leather and not the vendor price.  Basically a why you should just turn your own leather into it and not waste too much time buying stacks of thick leather for more than 1 gold
---
no inner focus unironically picking blessed recovery I hope you are joking.
---
Caverns of Time are also in Azeroth and would fit pretty nicely to the "time rewind" theme of classic, so why not a remade Hyjal raid as well?
---
Many people also pointed at grim batol being a good addition to classic. And why not add new content after a certain time for us to explore? I think that would be pretty great.
---
Imagine for a moment you have an awesome personal Chef, perhaps the best in the world. He decides one day to start also offering his services teaching Piano. You don't much care for Piano but whatever he does in his own time is fine. At first there is no change, but after a couple of months instead of cooking your steaks to perfection every time he burns a few. No big deal right? Fast forward 18 months later and you realize you are paying a guy to microwave gas station burritos and they can't be bothered to even acknowledge your complaints most of the time, but if he does actually listen all you get is some hand-waving apology and a frozen pizza. You might start think that if the guy wasn't teaching Piano 60 hours a week he could manage something better than a can of tomato soup and burnt grilled cheese. You might start to be a little upset that this awesome chef has let the quality of his work regress to amateur levels. You might even start to detest Pianos as irrational as that sounds. The one thing you know for sure is you really want a steak and this guy can make them better than anyone else in the world but he won't and the only reason you can see for that is because he is spending all of his time teaching shitstains how to pound out clair de lune.
---
no the class should never have been dps focused. Paladins in warcraft 3 were nothing but holy paladins with mediocre dps, it's how it should be in wow as well
---
Single target buffs never cost reagents
---
but they didn't cost a reagent, wherever you got the pic from is incorrect because you learned power word fortitude early on in the game, same with mark of the wild and arcane intellect. Only the group-wide buffs and greater blessings cost reagents
---
sure. stopped after wotlk. played a few days in cata and mop, but never found back to it. i am f'ing hyped for classic
---
Alliance tends to be more dominant in vanilla because of better racials and because they have paladins. 
---
MC will be cleared within 7 days of Classic release. 
---
I‚Äôll be fully geared and raid logging by then. 
---
Kargoz makes very informative and detailed guide videos.
---
These changes would entirely ruin Classic. 
---
Paladin is better in both pve and pvp. A lot of people who roll enhance shaman for pvp are in a for a nasty reality check. 
---
Same üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Aw man, I miss those days haha
---
That comparison doesn't make any sense at all. OP was suggesting the Chef wasn't going to do any more dishes in the future. This is a NOTORIOUSLY slow chef and takes forever to come up with new dishes. Him offering piano lessons on the side doesn't mean he's not making new dishes in the kitchen. 
---
Let me throw one more in there. Elemental shaman. Much better in PvP compared to enhacement and a really easy time raiding as resto. You can also always get OS enha gear and simply switch up your talent spec every once in a while.
---
There are 2 solid resto specs floating around. One is built with some PvP ele power baked in, and another one, much better for raiding, that goes down the enha tree to grab 2H specialization and improved totems.
---
Some people think Classic isn't worth releasing on its own and will die, so it needs expansions like flying mount TBC and WotLK.
---
No word yet on what happens when WotLK dies, no one thinks that far.
---
Hopefully the community doesn't kill Vanilla WoW a second time.
---
Just nuke the spectre damnit!
---
Reagents for single target spells would have changed your opinion on that pretty quickly I am going to wager.
---
Isn‚Äôt it canonically the Alliance that does that? She‚Äôs heavily involved in the Varian Wrynn storyline.
---
Hahaha. Yeah sure. 
---
I like to roleplay that my character is good at what they do, and that they're beyond needing a focusing object or reagent to cast a single target buff. Leaving the foci for the group buffs makes more sense to me.
---
Looks pretty similar to how I remember thottbot looked back in the day. So yeah, it's probably intended
---
berzerker stance -&gt; blood rage is two globals, longer than it takes you to entangle, since he has to react to that too.
---
even if the warrior already has rage by some miracle, I'd rather have him waste his intercept cooldown on somebody he can't lock down (and who will root him with nature's grasp), so he'll become prime pickings for everyone. 
---
You would do well with either class then, both are strong. Priests have a much easier leveling experience and are about on par for 1v1 dueling so I'd say it would be a good choice since that was your only downside in the post about priests
---
Those items still show up on regular wowhead, is it perhaps old relics from the game files? 
---
Nah you are wrong, you have always been able to be traded any item under Master Loot last expansion and now still you don't have to be able to equip an item to be traded it.   
---
This is b/s
---
&gt; The only thing I could ever accept AFTER Naxx
---
What does that entail if they do make post-Naxx content you don't 'accept'? Nobody will skip classic because some new raid is added.
---
Actually the way it worked in retail was you could roll for anything you could technically wear. Plate-wearers could roll for cloth, leather, mail and plate. Leather-wearers could only roll for leather and cloth, and so on.
---
  The former examples show up on regular wowhead, I'd have to assume thats just legacy stuff, especially when it has very low numbered ids. 
---
But the latter examples are interesting. I can't imagine them designing gear for post naxx content when that should be years away. It seems kinda hasty, even if we agree that post-naxx content is 100% inevitable. 
---
Dude, you are acting extremely immature. Why would everyone who disagrees with you be raging? Personally, I downvoted your replies because of your childish behavior.
---
While I do not 100% agree with the #nochanges crowd and I am an advocate for smart changes that do not break the vanilla feel, I dislike the way you behaved yourself here.
---
Adding flying mount TBC which kills the entire two classic continents, and "officially changes camp".
---
The community killed Vanilla WoW once already. Here's hoping they don't kill it a second time.
---
I hate it. It‚Äôs supposed to be used against bullying harassment etc. but the possibilities of exploiting it is huge. But my gripe is this... if someone is trolling you just do a /ignore? That‚Äôs literally what the system is there for. What, if someone in Trade chat spams anal memes? If you don‚Äôt like it use the ignore button and you‚Äôll never see that shit again. Trade chat can get political every now and then. Do people just report different opinions? It‚Äôs a scary system.
---
That's a change I wouldn't mind being implemented tbh.
---
I'd love to see new raids but not Tier 4 as the gear would be too overpowered. A very hard 20-man would be pretty nice so 20-man guilds could be a legitimate thing.
---
No, but it could destroy the Classic community if the game stops being Classic. 
---
Were the rank 11 spell tomes that you see on some pservers in the game in 1.12
---
Full T2 for priests is definitely not bad but I really only think it's worth it if you have the class trinket from ZG with it to get the most benefit out of the 8-set bonus.
---
Otherwise there are some incredibly strong offset pieces you don't want to pass up (Boots of Pure Thought and Truefaith Vestments come to mind).
---
That's a sad assumption, you have no idea what he is doing irl. If money is the thing you choose to brag about in a subreddit for games it makes you come over as rather insecure.
---
Yeah, that's my only concern with the possibility of new content - power creep. Not sure how that could be handled in terms of rewards, gear that's better than AQ but worse than Naxxramas? 'Cosmetic' rewards that are just for bragging rights, etc?
---
Most people will be though. 
---
Im thinking of going arms to 60 (and then prot) but still be tanking dungeons through the leveling. How important is having tank gear during the pre-60 dungeons? Or is having a 1h &amp; shield enough if you manage your pulls etc? Hoping this question was simple enough 
---
I had calls on apple for earnings call when it shot up 10% that week
---
Yea im super insecure about 10% on a weekly call and 400% returns 
---
That's what Game were for, back when Blizzard was willing to pay employees for a good game experience, before Activision Blizzard cost cutting ethos.
---
They've already tipped their hand with the loot sharing thing. They do not want to spend the money needed to employ GMs.
---
There will more than likely be right click report. It's going to be a nasty surprise for those who don't realize just how badly it will hurt Classic.
---
If enough people right click report you for messing with IF, you will get auto banned. Even if you successfully appeal and get a human to review and upturn it, the damage is still done because you got kicked for however long it took for the review to fall through.
---
One of the strongest classes.  They have some bad matchups like anyone else but generally very strong tools.
---
Shit post or not, I think you're reading it wrong. 
---
My interpretarion: BFA, son of vanilla says that it only sees darkness to its father. Probably because of all the negativity associated with BFA. Also it does not have anything to do with wrath.
---
Tank gear is not at all important pre 60 or even really at 60 until you get into raids.  Arms will work great as a tank for leveling with just fps gear.
---
Absolutely, especially from retail minded players.
---
Just yesterday a party of lvl 60 rogues were camping the flight master in gromgol. People were absolutely furious. We're talking hours of no flightmaster where most hardcore players set their hearth.
---
Can you imagine how many reports those rogues would get? Enough to trigger the automated ban.
---
Savix just got a 30 day ban because he got mass reported by an RBG premade. Why would anyone the no Classic will turn out any different, considering the state of retail? (And similar situations in other Activision Blizzard games like HotS)
---
They came out with AQ. All private servers have them and so will Classic. 
---
Depends on what you mean by fully geared. And depends if you want to have a rapid advancement through raids, if so, you will have to farm countless hours for golds and flasks and everything raid related.
---
Also, you'll have to find 39 other people fully geared. 
---
Not a nightmare but alliance definitely has the advantage during the first 2 raid tiers in terms of travel time. 
---
Alliance has the upper hand in all aspects of vanilla wow though. There‚Äôs a reason it‚Äôs called the easy mode faction. 
---
Not gonna happen. The mess will hurt Classic, not Classic helping the mess.
---
We'll be lucky if Classic isn't DoA.
---
No, classic is like uchiha madara.
---
Mass loot is a pretty big change. It would make gold farming much simpler and ruin the economy. 
---
Almost every class has aoe
---
Wash my car
---
So you got lucky with stocks and you think that gives you bragging rights? You should try games with lootboxes then, it might suit you. It would remove one more elitist from my community as well, that's what I'd call a win-win.
---
And if grammar Nazism is your way to go, check your punctuation on the way out, thanks.
---
Stock options
---
Ergo If im wrong I lose everything. If I bought stocks Id get a 10% return
---
I bought weekly calls and got 400%
---
My ego is so high right now I need to be drug tested. Ahahaha
---
Listen you poor little child, I am the CEO of multinational investment firm. Puny day traders like yourself are slime on the bottom of my boot. Go wash my yacht.  While you‚Äôre at it, learn to not be a douche. 
---
Fully geared means you have the current raids (MC &amp; Ony) on farm status. MC and Ony can be cleared in green gear the first time. 
---
The community didn‚Äôt kill Classic wow, Blizzard did when they released TBC. Rest assured that Blizzard isn‚Äôt taking away Classic WoW this time, as they said in the announcement: it‚Äôs here to stay. 
---
If they re-release TBC, any problems it has will be tied to itself, since they‚Äôre not going to force anybody to update. That would defeat the whole purpose.
---
And I dont know people can drag the leveling part out like that. 
---
Id rather be 60 fast, getting geared ahead of everyone else, have prof maxed out so Im the one getting all the money, have a raidspot that cant be touched and all my logged time goes to raiding and consumables. 
---
Name your firm and lets conpare return rate
---
I had EA calls frrom december 21st and apple calls frkm the day before earnings
---
You didnt come close to my net gain you fucking loser
---
I bought EA calls at 73 ITS ABOUT TO HIT 100 dollars a share you piece of shit
---
Tell me about your fucking negative return rate like every other hedge fund
---
Pussy
---
Which will be very easy. 
---
Most people who are very excited for Classic wont be taking 6 months to reach 60. 
---
Get a hunter and you're fine. 
---
I'm thinking something like this for all-round PvP and PvE healer
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGsMiqobxtcc
---
This for offensive healer, once my PvE gear is better
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bx0GoZfzthcZVMGpczo
---
What do you think?
---
"normal first time in 10 days" u do know that the average lvl 60 is 12-14 /played right? extreme is 25+ (if u go watch videos of vanilla back in the day of REAL noobs) it could take them up to 50 days 
---
(example here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOj396mPWoQ) 
---
Now i don't exspect anyone to be that bad and if people download quest addons &amp; dont mind grinding when there is no quest 6-9 days should be where most end up, but for people that try not to grind/lvl professions/use ah a lot/do a lot of dungeons/dont download addons 12-14 days should be exspected.
---
Let me introduce you to my feelings right now: https://youtu.be/eGTrWlzK3Ho
---
Mage, by far.
---
Top pve class
---
Top pvp class
---
Top solo class
---
Top gold farming class
---
Top QoL class (portals, food, mana gem)
---
No thank you. 
---
To me the leveling is the worst of WoW. Doing the same shit against another type of mob for hours and hours. Collect 10 batshit (guano), collect 10 foxtails, collect 10 hoves and so on and on and on. 
---
To me WoW is about getting together and raiding, wpvp, battleground and the other stuff you do when you are maxed level. 
---
I'll return for classic, possibly meander a bit in TBC, but likely quit long before wotkl. Same as last. 
---
You could also just decide to be a good PVE healer and a not optimal PVP healer. 
---
what are your opinions on [Blight](http://classicdb.ch/?item=7959#created-by) when leveling? [Executioner's Cleaver](https://classicdb.ch/?item=13018), while obviously better, isn't always available, plus is tends to cost an arm and a leg. this polearm, while way faster, seems like a reasonable alternative, especially given how shitty dungeon drops are at that level range.
---
is the faster speed that much of a problem?
---
That would be awesome! I've seen couple articles floating around that do that sort of thing for a particular dungeon, and it's awesome. That way I can still try to do every dungeon, but I'm at least being very efficient with the times I do them.
---
I'd like to see more diversity in gear, not stronger loot.
---
Melee is a last resort option.
---
Ideally when someone gets close you hit them with a wingclip then spam your raptor and mogoose strike macro button whilst moving away, hopefully you'll crit and do a decent chunk of damage.
---
Once you're far enough you hit them with a scatter shot then while they're dazed you move further away then hit them with a concussive shot and resume your normal kiting maneuvers.
---
Not sure why you are getting downvoted. You would eventually win simply through attrition. 
---
Pretty much this. They're also not gear dependent either.
---
Hate to be nit-picky but the Frostwolves weren't present in Kalimdor when the Warsong drank upon the blood of Mannoroth in WC3. They had already established themselves in the Alterac Mountains during Warcraft 1.
---
Frostwolves did not partake in drinking the blood initially in Outland before the first war and when the Warsong clan drank the blood in Kalimdor in order to kill Cenarius in WC3 was the second time they had drank the blood.
---
Mage, Hunter, lock, or Druid. All are efficient levelers, all are good in PvP, especially wPvP. All are needed for endgame stuff (probably the mage or lock the most, but it‚Äôs not like raids don‚Äôt need a hunter or a Druid). 
---
How is it possible to be this dumb? It's literally in the patch notes for 1.1.1.
---
  [**Patch 1.1.1**](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_1.1.1) **(2004-11-17):** Reagent requirements have been removed.  
---
You're justifying this with PvP server rules, but as I said, imo those don't mean shit when there's a matter of basic human decency at hand. 
---
The point of doing stuff like this is not to create a legendary memorial of some kind, it's to help the grieving friends and relatives cope with the loss. 
---
Buffs are still prohibitively expensive to cast so it's not really "just another button." You  can buff someone without a cost to yourself in time spent drinking.
---
Try reading the patch notes?? In an age of fake news you can at least bother to look things up before spouting off nonsense.
---
* üì∑ [**Patch 1.1.1**](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_1.1.1) **(2004-11-17):** Reagent requirements have been removed.

Bubble -&gt; 5x Sapper Charge -&gt; Hammer of Wrath.
---
That‚Äôs fair enough. There‚Äôs just a lot of people who think you can‚Äôt cry about this when you know what you‚Äôre getting yourself Into, especially when this type of play is encouraged and partly what the server is there for. All human decency is gone at that point to people. Especially since they had the chance to have the funeral in a main city.
---
Many people already mentioned the pure environmental changes, but I'd just like to point out, in particular, the changes in terms of quest design. Quest design started to become more hub-centric from TBC onward really. TBC quest hubs didn't require you to backtrack like you did in Classic. You could safely start in a zone and end the zone in one swing. However, the hubs were still spread out, so it was still alright.
---
Come Cataclysm it essentially turned into some sort of calculated formula though. Hyjal is the epitome of this, with the entire zone just being a sequence of hubs that each give you ~3 quests at a time and upon completion tell you to go to the next hub. Luckily not every Cataclysm zone was as atrocious as that, something like Deepholm still carried some of the sporadic questing patterns of old, but backtracking is something that never returned after vanilla.
---
So expanding on vanilla quests, they're very different in terms of layout and quantity. Hubs still exist, but a lot of quests are found outside of hubs, and you really need all the quests you can get to level up properly. Even if you take all the quests in a zone however, before long you'll find that the zone has significantly outlevel'd you. This starts from around level 15-20, depending a bit on the zone. You will do a handful of quests in a zone, then move to a different one and do some quests there. A few levels later, you return to the earlier zone and wrap up the quests.
---
To summarise it, quest design in Classic is non-linear. Returning once to a zone is standard, and some particularly big zones like STV you can expect to return to 3 or even 4 times before you complete the zone. Honestly it's nice to return to a zone at a later level and get to do the stuff you could not before.
---
Can be cleared in greens?
---
Yes, CAN be cleared in greens, in theory. In reality? No, IT CANNOT. The guilds who will clear MC and Ony will have their members in pre-raid BiS on at least half the slots. The other half will still be mainly blues. They will HAVE TO use flasks (to make up for gear) and loads of consumables.
---
Due to the FACT that gold is going to be damn hard to get in the first couple months, most guilds won't afford flasks.
---
What you are talking about is plain stupidity. On your way to 60, YOU WILL HAVE PLENTY OF BLUE GEAR. I can bet any amount of money that NO GUILD is able to clear MC in greens and without flasks and world buffs.
---
The tanks will DIE so fast, it wouldn't even be fun to watch. The healers will run OOM in less than a minute. It is mathematically IMPOSSIBLE to do it in greens.
---
I'm not the one foaming at the mouth because someone made fun of retail =)
---
Only the tank needs certain key items from dungeons and some fire resistance. Rest of the raid can pretty much go in greens. MC will be cleared before the 2nd server reset by most hardcore guilds. There‚Äôs guilds planning to clear MC within the first week of Classic release. 
---
After 50 runs of your item not dropping you will have different opinion.
---
You can always go back later. They aren‚Äôt hard quests to do. The point is to get away from the crowd.
---
You're right. In fact let's go even further, why is EVERY class able to deal damage? I say we take weapons off of every class except Warrior so only they can deal damage.
---
You're against an ideal because of a cherry-picked and heavily patched example. Maybe you need to take a step back and think.
---
Maybe the solution is adding an entirely new ability that no other class has, but you completely stop all discussion because RETAIL BAD. VANILLA GOOD.
---
Vanilla was great.  BC was great.  WotLK was great.  All 3 were different, but all 3 were great.
---
Cataclysm destroyed the game.   LITERALLY destroyed the game.  Broke my heart that they decimated the old world to implement flying.  
---
I liked the zones in MoP.  They were gorgeous!  Didn‚Äôt like much else.  
---
WoD.  One word: Garrisons. 
---
Legion:  bought the game.  Hated the ‚Äúeveryone gets to kill the same exact Rare mobs once for credit‚Äù design.  Leveled my main to max, then said ‚Äúmeh‚Äù and unsubscribed.  
---
BfA:  Haven‚Äôt bothered at all.  
---
Classic: going to play the shit out of it!  
---
Thank you!
---
I actually like rhe idea of a class that deals no damage. A full utility support class? Sounds DOPE. Far more interesting than a press 1 rotational class
---
You never bought that nearly removing player to player interaction while traveling through the world and removing common chokepoints for PvP was a mistake?
---
Makes sense why you're not really a Vanilla fan.
---
For me, there has never been any game like pre-Cata Wow.  While I‚Äôll get bored after a couple of years, I know I‚Äôll always go back to Classic.  If they drop BC 2 years later, I‚Äôll play that too, then maybe even WotLK again.   
---
'Made fun' is being generous.
---
He said you'd get reported for going in Alliance zones as Horde, which is moronic.
---
I didn't, but you didn't even read what I wrote so...probably just stop.  You have zero clue what you are talking about.
---
Shadow priests should be there primarily for shadow weaving since we'll have the 16 debuff slot limit. You dont need 2 though. Tell your locks to learn to manage their life tap w/ potions, as well as to only do it when incoming damage to the tanks and group is at a lull, and if they must during this time, they can rely on pots.
---
I think the notion of rolling on an RP server with no desire to RP as being a cruel joke.  I'm not going to tell you what to do, but if I walked by you on a wooded road and interacted with you IC and you responded with "I'm not really into that kind of thing" it's upsetting.  
---
It's like having a player on your call of duty squad that isn't really into PvP.  It's frustrating for everyone.
---
I think it would be cool to have sets for offspecs, maybe some different stat allocation and different set bonuses while keeping the same ilvl but also a different cosmetic look. Some of the t3 sets are pretty goofy and the thought of that being the end game goal is a bit sad :(
---
As long as Activision keeps their greedy hands out of it I‚Äôm sure they could add some horizontal content.  God help us if it‚Äôs successful and they decide to strap the milking machine to it though.  
---
Thanks, something like this? Moved the Spriest to the tank group, should be where the healing get the most value, and replaced the 2nd spriest with a holy

---
Hopefully no matter what Activision Blizzard decide to do, Vanilla WoW will indeed be preserved in Classic or any other means.
---
The issue with server progression is what we've seen in pservers. When a server is progressed a patch (with optional transfers, meaning you can stay on the Vanilla server) the remaining Vanilla server invariably dies.
---
I've personally went through the death of a server like this, and it's just like what happened in retail. People stop raiding the moment TBC is announced, even before it comes out.
---
If Activision Blizzard decides to go one way or another, I hope they manage to preserve Vanilla no matter what they do.
---
DM doesn't invalidate MC. I'm a caster gear officer in a Naxx progressing guild and the general understanding is very superficial and lacking when it comes to itemization.
---
While many DM pieces are better in terms of raw SP and is actually better for raiding MC (ironically), much gear from MC is better for wpvp and general solo PvE, and especially AoE farming, which mages and warlocks will do a lot of.
---
So even if my warlocks have felcloth hood/shoulders, amplifying cloak, and so on, they still want to get T1 from MC because it will help them farm consumes and gold.
---
I am not talking on a forum full of "avarage players" am I? OP wants to play 12h/day and rush 60....  
---
Looks pretty good actually. But I‚Äôd drop 2 warlocks and 1 shadow priest for 3 additional melee just because of how much easier the content is when you stack melee. Fury damage is ridiculous in MC and BWL. 
---
Is doing solo content with disc/holy spec priest an absolute nightmare? (lvling, questing, grinding)
---
You're doing the exactly same thing again. 
---
What's so hard about not PvPing for just a little while and just in a very specific area to respect the grieving. 
---
&gt; The human decency doesn‚Äôt mean anything
---
Well that's where I disagree. Certain values matter anywhere and anytime, like respect for the dead and the grieving. That's at least how I was raised. 
---
The first half of Karazhan, everything before the Curator, was *extremely* vanilla. If I recall correctly it didn't use *any* TBC models. But from the Curator onwards they switched to using TBC models and they switched *hard*. Arcane Guardians, Nether Dragons, Ethereals, Eredar, Fleshbeasts, etc. If Karazhan made it into Classic I could see them leaving the first half as is but making an entirely new second half.
---
How do you get them?
---
WotLK was great, but it had serious problems, and didn't fix any issues most people see with BC. For example, heroics were only even slightly difficult for 1 week, and even then they were pretty easy compared to BC, so there was no difficult 5 mans. It's best raid lasted the shortest, and got overshadowed by a 1 room raid because it had more *gearscore*. And then LFG, which is a great tool for the older content that is impossible to find a group for, but as far as the current content is concerned, it really should never have been there.
---
BC had "issues" like flying and dailies (both of which I enjoy), yet Wrath kept those issues and reaaally added some hazards to the game philosophy that seem to compound with every xpac.
---
... I'm still gonna play the shit out of it when it launches, though...
---
Both factions have their reasons to kill, however different. 
---
Horde's storyline is pretty much to gain trust with Emberstrife, killing Drakkisath to imbue the amulet made by Emberstrife to then go kill Onyxia. 
---
Thrall isnt the one doing appeasement, hes fighting off enemies relentlessly who directly oppose the horde's will to be free. Northwatch gets burned down by the horde, the Kul Tiras get fought off. And in the same wake he tells the member of the horde to kill Onyxia, because shes encroaching on Durotar and Orgrimmar. She's far too close to not be a threat, hence she must die.
---
Aren't the current occupants of Grim Batol just some red dragons and dead orcs? I wonder what sort of raid could be made from that.
---
hmm, the "Dawn" ones don't. And they already have full sets...+
---
Maybe some leftovers from 1.4 DB? Or... a teaser?
---
I though Orcs took it over similar to BRM and pushed the dragons out or enslaved them.
---
Could be completely wrong!
---
Yeah, the rare mechanic sounded fun when they announced it before WoD, but it lost it's appeal *so* fast. "oh boy, 30 garrison resources..." and then that creature is just a nuisance after it's been used.
---
this is a pretty good video on what happend [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGp35Asro0g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGp35Asro0g)
---
&gt; Karazhan
---
hmm, can it be related to the "Rising Dawn" and other "Shiny Dawn" sets?
---
Yeah he is making fun of the right click report thing.  It's funny, and you're a sensitive little wuss if you take offense of someone making fun of a damn video game for christ sake.
---
&gt;You're doing the exactly same thing again.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;What's so hard about not PvPing for just a little while and just in a very specific area to respect the grieving.
---
What's so hard about doing it, in a place where barely any PvP happen? - What you're doing right now, to me, is the exact same thing as if I booted up a random CS:GO game and I suddenly have to not shoot the enemy team, because they're having a funeral. I get that WoW is a more social game, but the point still stands. Some people play the game in a competitive way, just like CS:GO. And boot it up to PvP.
---
&gt; Well that's where I disagree. Certain values matter anywhere and  anytime, like respect for the dead and the grieving. That's at least how  I was raised. 
---
I think a lot of people have respect for anybody being dead, just a little less over a video-game, and even less when you choose to have a funeral in one of the most contested PvP areas, and even less when you choose to do it on a PvP server, which encourage this shit.
---
QoL is for losers and cry babies that want instant gratification.
---
PROVE ME WRONG
---
Despite the issues it presents, copies are a better choice than transfers for the health of Classic, so people can still hop on whenever they feel like it and play the toon they've invested time in. 
---
But regardless of how they do it, Blizzard will have to merge servers at *some point*. Maybe it's after Naxx has been out for a while, hopefully not before, and by then it would make sense to launch BC anyways. 
---
I know merges are a dirty word to the Classic Community, but if it's that or playing on a dead realm, there isn't really a choice.
---
Im saying its probably past any return classic can bring, especially with new developments. But different opinions = lack of knowledge eh? Ok boss....
---
I remember using it on people with mounts and being able to run with them. Unless I‚Äôm completely misremembering that. 
---
You might need 3-4 locks for the curses and Garr adds. 
---
Could be Argent Dawn related step up gear similar to ZG and AQ20. Rising = growing = becoming more powerful.  
---
It's all too risky though. Blizzard would never bet Classic‚Äôs success like this.
---
Yeah...."dope". In a game about killing monsters to level up. Good thing you're not a dev right?
---
AQ20 iirc
---
3 is plenty for that. Going with 7 locks &amp; Spriests you‚Äôre arbitrarily lowering the raids damage. 
---
so many whiners on reddit "buuhuu i give up on classic buhuu" just wait and lets see before you cry about things you dont know anything about yet.
---
Let me start by saying I main priest and love priestels entirely. I play with the talent ALL DAY sometimes.   
---
Here is my 56-60 pvp/dungeon build (I guess you can do MC/ony with it too). 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMrsAioobxtcc
---
   
---
Keep note matyrdom &amp; healing focus are most important.   
---
Imp inner fire for armor and having high armor is important for high survivability.  
---
 Improved healing &amp; mental agility for pve Mana conservation.   
---
Imp Mana burn to zap Mana faster off people.  
---
Holy Nova rank 1 to reveal rogues.  
---
And of course 5/5 unbreakable will to resist.   
---
Now I'm going troll so I might also go this build for shadowguard blackouts &amp; pve: 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGsAboZbxtccZV 
---
When ever someone hits me with a spell or attack, they will have a 10% chance to be stunned. Stack armor with this build and you will not drop fast on the field.  
---
I have tons of other custom builds made, if you need just holla.
---
I'm definitely for more gear diversity (I think it's almost required) and I think they should be extremely careful when implementing stronger gear but I'm not opposed to introducing new extremely difficult content that rewards marginal upgrades. Definitely not an entire raid's worth of content and marginal upgrades but a few sprinkled in here or there for the top percent of raiders.
---
For example, they could introduce a new raid that is at Naxx difficulty and gives Naxx-level rewards but then a single boss in the raid also comes with an Ulduar-style hardmode that gives slightly better than Naxx-level rewards. The loot is extremely difficult to obtain and only a slight upgrade over the easier alternative so it's bragging rights more than anything.
---
&gt; What you're doing right now, to me, is the exact same thing as if I booted up a random CS:GO game and I suddenly have to not shoot the enemy team, because they're having a funeral. I get that WoW is a more social game, but the point still stands.
---
The point doesn't stand, because that comparison is utter rubbish. Not only are those situations not even remotely comparable, the funeral ganking has also nothing to do with competition, its was done purely to "troll" the grieving players. 
---
&gt; I think a lot of people have respect for anybody being dead, just a little less when you choose to have a funeral in one of the most contested PvP areas, and even less when you choose to do it on a PvP server, which encourage this shit.
---
Once again justifying this shit with PvP server rules. 
---
Obviously those guys don't have any respect. An important part of showing respect is that sometimes you refrain from doing things that might be technically allowed and fun for you to do if it's a matter of human decency. 
---
The spriest is also a solid choice putting him into the WL group. In vanilla warlocks ditch int gear and go with as much +sp as possible. WLs life tap A LOT and I mean A LOT. Having constant heals on 4 casters who are constantly below 100% health will make healers lives easier by quite a notch.
---
I don't think we know until the beta. Since they're updating the engine this is something we might see, but if they stick to a no changes classic it won't be available.
---
I don't know why you would miss meditation. This is the standard tri-spec, annoying priest build:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMrsZbhtZEMrz0uo 
---
With this build you have the most important stuff. Mana Regen in disc tree, holy Nova for rogues, silence and ve in shadow.  
---
I'm only going blackout cause of troll shadowguard, but basically this build makes you super annoying and hard to kill. It is suggested only with higher gear, at least T1 equivalent
---
Reserve them in AQ20 runs or buy from AH for 1k gold. 
---
If you're actually able to farm enough gold to earn that reputation on a server, you've kinda earned the right to 'sell' gold imo.
---
They did make it 10%, in tbc. 
---
Oh, never played human. Oof. 
---
Which is completely fine in AV and to some degree AB. 
---
&gt; Argent Dawn related step up gear similar to ZG and AQ20. Rising = growing = becoming more powerful.
---
&gt; 
---
You mean adding something between 1.10 and 1.11?
---
My bet is on no. Also, "Rising", "Brilliant", "Shiny" could refer to sunrise. Guess, when you wake up from some quite greenish Dream?
---
I imagine it will be the same way. People can‚Äôt just make new characters to come bitch at you if you kill them. 
---
Grim Batol, Emerald Dream and Karazhan (with Crypts), to name a few, would be great for some post-Naxx raids. 
---
But it is VITAL that these raids do NOT offer higher ilvl than Naxx, only sideways upgrades. Maybe a few "offspec" items. But nothing obviously better.
---
How much gold is it worth though in classic? How long will it take someone to farm that much gold? I don‚Äôt see it as sustainable.
---
I think you desperately want it to be the Emerald Dream so you'll make the connection no matter what the sets are called.
---
Warlock DPS is abyssmal on early stage content due to the lack of proper +hit and SPD gear. 
---
You just kind of have to accept it for the time being until they manage to get a good amount of BWL and ZG gear. 
---
The reason why would you want a shadow priest in the raid is because RL's girlfriend wants to play one, not because it is really needed in any way, you'd rather want a holy priest in hybrid spec stacking Shadow Weaving for the warlocks, assuming that you have a good amount of them.
---
Generally horde is melee-dps oriented faction, so stacking more melees is reasonable.
---
Some time prior to vanilla some orcs took over Grim Batol and enslaved a bunch of red dragons including Alexstrasza but shortly before vanilla Alexstrasza broke free and killed all the orcs that didn't escape.
---
&gt;The point doesn't stand, because that comparison is utter rubbish. Not only are those situations not even remotely comparable, the funeral ganking has also nothing to do with competition, its was done purely to "troll" the grieving players.
---
It's rubbish, because you're not of that opinion. They're completely comparable, because they're both games which have set rules and people play within them. The games are booted up by people just wanting to play the game and suddenly they have to restrict their gameplay, because some people want to hold a funeral.
---
Also, there's absolutely no evidence, that the sheer honor they get from out in the world HKs weren't a factor as well. And I know for a fact, it's a factor for many people.
---
&gt;Once again justifying this shit with PvP server rules.
---
Yeah, and the server rules are usually enough for most people. That, paired with the fact you chose to have a funeral in in a shitty place, demanding people stop whatever they're doing, so you can have your funeral. 
---
&gt;Obviously  those guys don't have any respect. An important part of showing respect  is that sometimes you refrain from doing things that might be  technically allowed and fun for you to do if it's a matter of human  decency.
---
They can have plenty of respect, but there's definitely a sweet spot of what is okay and what isn't. You can't have funerals everywhere and demand people stop whatever they're doing, and if they don't, they don't respect the dead. Where I'm from, funerals are usually held in churches and/or in private places/areas, partly because you're not supposed to have it a place where strangers show up, or where it can bother other people.
---
Winterspring on a PvP server isn't your safe space.
---
Yes in the early years. But somewhere down the road your gear options were restricted with the group loot option, at least in LFD.
---
Some people have real lives as well.
---
Yeah under Master Loot ofc. I‚Äôm talking about PuGs, using Group Loot and the like.
---
Ahh, explains all the dragons outside
---
There usually are mediators, a member of top guild who would accept gold and wait for other guy to receive a wow token before sending the gold to buyer. For small 5-10% cut, this way anyone could easily sell gold for WoW tokens. 
---
Lol no one cares. It was taken out so early very few people ever had to deal with it. 
---
I mean, they just haven‚Äôt said anything else since BlizzCon. It doesn‚Äôt mean they haven‚Äôt heard feedback. They don‚Äôt tell us about stuff when they decide it. They wait for water coolers. They could still change it.
---
Maybe have a master looter who pays attention? Or maybe pay attention to what buttons you push. If you are in a group with someone who does it they are either a lying ninja or too impatient to make sure they don‚Äôt hit need. Just don‚Äôt run with people who don‚Äôt know how to loot.
---
That doesn't mean anyone has earned the right to buy gold.
---
I don‚Äôt see why you wouldn‚Äôt want more content after naxx. Not like right away but I would love to see classic wow live as long as possible and if naxx is where all progression stops then eventually people will get bored. I much rather see new content made for classic wow than have a remake for multiple expansions.  It could fail terribly. Or it could keep the game alive much longer and give new experiences to people who love vanilla either way it wouldn‚Äôt be rushed only after an appropriate amount of time would I want new content like that.
---
Yeah, that makes sense. I guess I'll drop force of will for disc and pick up meditation for tri spec. Imma roll troll too btw and was considering disc with blacloit aswell.  In your opinion, how good is shadow weaving in healer tri spec?
---
Clan Battlehammer on Emerald Dream? 
---
I mean the community and the in game systems is what makes vanilla vanilla. Adding a new raid (NOT DUNGEONS) post naxx I don‚Äôt think would destroy anything. I think it could only add more life to classic wow. I wouldn‚Äôt want it to come out quickly but maybe after a couple years
---
It's worth it just to get to silence/ve, better than anything else on the way. The key point is Nova, meditation and silence. Silence &amp; blackout can cause a lot of trouble for enemies.
---
So I've heard, never played melee though. 
---
Yeah when u open the site u have to wait couple mins before u can use it.
---
enh shamans can easily get into all 5mans or ubrses. they are rather pretty good.
---
pve wise only trouble is raids. though get your nightfall and you can pug 1tier raids and 20 mans at least.
---
warlocks suck in bgs without a top gear or a group. and until you get a gear you are very underwhelming to play. and first tier which will be first monthes gonna be sucky. melees train and rape, you got no escape at all. warlock is favorite target for warriors.
---
if you want to play that type of shit, play a mage much better for that, and more chaotic aswell i'd say. guess you are fixated on Orc/taurens. 
---
no
---
You. Are. Doing. It. Again.
---
Ignoring decency crying "muh PvP on a PvP server". 
---
Literally doesn't matter that it's a PvP server and that it's not in safe zone. If you're a decent human being you let others cope in peace with their horrible loss as they see fit. 
---
$6 gets you 100g on private servers from 3rd party sellers.  My best guess is a wow token should be good for around 200g once things settle down.  
---
So you are saying that you want the easier game, again. BFA is the other way mate.
---
Here come the chinese goldfarmers.
---
‚ÄúJust a small change nothing big‚Äù 
---
&gt;Blizzrad against china farmers
---
Why are they always china farmers?  I've known Canadians, Norwegians, and Americans who've sold gold. 
---
I believe a lot of people will take up skinning that plus you don't have to hunt for nodes for it makes for a huge surplus. Sure you could probably sell some for more than vendor price but that takes time dealing with the ah while leveling. I think around 40 to 50 the leather is worth selling to players. 
---
I know. I used to play a priest back then. Never bothered me to carry a bunch of candles. Was part of the game and was just part of raid/dungeon prep.
---
I want classic wow to have content after naxx. I do not want catch up mechanics, I do not want bc or wotlk, I don‚Äôt want gear vendors outside of the pvp vendors, I want classic to live as long as possible and I think the only way for that to happen is to add new content to it....eventually. :).  So I agree 
---
&gt; Loot trading is garbage, and will fundamentally change how PUGs work.
---
I don't think so. Unless the overwhelming majority of Classic players turn out to be huge assholes. I don't think that's the case. I think loot trading abuse will be a rarity, just like "normal" ninja looting. And just like normal ninjaing it will be detected and called out, so loot trading abusers can be blacklisted. 
---
What are you even doing on this sub then if you don't care for Classic at all? 
---
Yeah but you have to farm that... gold sellers have several farmers. In this case it‚Äôs just you. I don‚Äôt think it will be widespread solely due to how much time one person would have to put in to it. If they started charging real money then blizzard would pit a stop to it fast.
---
I would bet Blizzard gates the opening of Ony/MC for at least the first 3, maybe 4 weeks after release. I can only imagine the bitching if they had them open from day 1 and server/queue issues allow some people a huge head start over others.
---
if $6 gets you 100g now it would be +- 333g for a Token since a token is worth $20. 
---
I would 100% main the bard
---
The end game of Vanilla wasn‚Äôt about raids, like it is today.  If you think it is, you will be disappointed because the raid mechanics were so much simpler and more about coordinating 40 people and preparing for raids - like farming mats for conumeables, farming resist gear for guildies and farming (building)  your own reputation to be able to be in the raid group.   
---
The end game of Vanilla is the journey through the world, not getting to the raids.  
---
Don‚Äôt miss out in the incredible journey that Vanilla has to offer or you will miss out on what the game has to offer the most:  an amazing, living world filled with potential friends to experience the journey together.   
---
Vanilla isn‚Äôt about gear or raids, literally.  You can get to 60 while still wearing a few greens.   It‚Äôs about losing track of time, about making new relationships and experiences  and carefully making it through quests and dungeons with the help of others - not about ‚Äúgogogo‚Äù and doing it as fast as possible on your own, like it is today.   
---
I would have to go back and verify patch notes to be certain, but I'm fairly confident that faction restrictions (per single account) were not removed until sometime in Wrath, patch 3.2 maybe? Meaning that yes, during the entire life of OG vanilla, players were restricted to one faction per server/realm, per account. If you wanted to play both factions using one account, you had to do so via different servers/realms. If you purchased a second account, doubling your monthly subscription fee, only then could you have both factions on the same realm.
---
For the Classic re-release, this is how it should be.
---
Level 44?? You were almost there!
---
&gt;You. Are. Doing. It. Again.
---
Because I shouldn't have to explain it any differently, or come up with any other reason. People usually respect the dead. They just don't want to be bothered by funerals in a fucking video-game, having to stop whatever the fuck they booted up the game to do. Take your funeral somewhere private if you don't want people to show up.
---
&gt; Ignoring decency crying "muh PvP on a PvP server". 
---
Making a funeral in a game where it's about killing each other, expecting people not to do so. What could possibly go wrong. 
---
&gt; Literally doesn't matter that it's a PvP server and that it's not in  safe zone. If you're a decent human being you let others cope in peace  with their horrible loss as they see fit. 
---
Apparently, to a lot of people, you don't, when the funeral is in a shitty location where people show up to do other things. The world doesn't revolve around funerals being held in shitty places. People still have their Ekos, Lotus' and HKs to farm. People still boot up the game to PvP. You might as well have held a funeral outside a supermarket and cry about people going there to buy groceries. 
---
But that's the beauty of it. We can disagree and it'll still happen in Vanilla, without any of us getting banned. Actions result in people excluding you from their community, or welcomes you. 
---
‚ÄúIf someone is trolling you just do a /ignore‚Äù
---
Exactly this, this is/was an the most effective method to filter anyone i found to be a pest. It worked when i was 15 will work now at almost 30 years old, its pretty fail-proof even across different generations of the player base. Why would i want to report someone and have them muted for what, 24 hours? When ignore is a permanent, editable way to do so to your liking. This is coming from someone thats played almost every expansion and never even received a warning, yet alone mute.
---
I believe it's easier to farm retail to buy a token than it is to farm classic to trade gold, even if you're not interested in retail, also there's no risk of being scammed.
---
We use addons like crazy in pservers and its just as fun. The thing about addons is it‚Äôs a players preference. QoL changes aren‚Äôt shoved down a players throat.
---
Wrath's biggest sins that weren't also BC sins were LFD and the massive boost to welfare/catch-up gear. Tier 9 and 10 could be bought for heroic badges, which made lower tiers and dungeon gear irrelevant. Naxxramas and heroics got downgraded to badge farm mode, and Ulduar became irrelevant for most players. That was the beginning of the clusterfuck that is retail now with only the current patch being what matters and a single expansion covering 375 item levels.
---
Not on my server.
---
TBF, Gearscore was a problem that the community introduced, not Blizzard. I also remember the ICC 5-mans being a decent challenge too. Not so much the other heroics. Everyone felt overgeared in those.
---
If I make a Priest and go tailoring, what should my 2nd profession be? Maybe mining for transitioning to engineering. Maybe herbing to transition to alchemy? Maybe skinning for vendor and decide later? 
---
you can easily get that in a day
---
What's WITH the random CAPITALIZATION?
---
As others have said, if you're playing casually, then just pick what you think looks better. It's your character and you're going to have to stare at it all the time. And by "casually" I mean...you're probably never going past rank 8 in PvP and you will do your share of UBRS/ZG/AQ20, but probably not much else.
---
If you think you will raid 40-mans, then I would go Orc. Once BWL is released, and from that point to the end of the game, you will only ever use Crossbows (so the Troll racial for +WS to BOWS no longer applies). While Berserking is nice, you have to be incredibly precise with it as while active it will change your skill rotation. More often than not, as an Orc, I found myself resisting AoE stuns from various trash mobs which allowed me to keep dpsing, while the Troll hunters had to wait out those stuns, doing no damage. I always thought this felt superior to having 5% extra damage to beasts. If you git gud with your pet micro, your pet can stay alive and the bonus damage that your pet does from the Orc racial is nice too.
---
&gt;gold sellers have several farmers
---
Same people, multiboxers grinding instances using gold into wow token to supplement their 5 subscriptions can easily pull 200g/hour.
---
The only time in vanilla I recall lots of people mass respecing all the time was in the PreBC patch. Before that, a respec was rare. 
---
A token costs $20, it's value is a $15 subscription.
---
&gt; What are the downsides to allowing someone to create characters of both factions on a PVP server?
---
Spying, trolling, insulting. You could still do that back in the day with two accounts, it was just costly and therefore not that many people did it. Definitely should not be in the game because it will surely be abused. 
---
Nope, but it's a little slow. It's a nice boost when you can go shadow form.
---
I would love to play priest but I'm worried that it won't appeal to me after 400+ days /played maining mage heh ;) 
---
Duel spec is a huge change. From the warrior perspective it would mean that you can get all the tanks you want in full prot and all the dps fury you want all the time. That is a massive change from having to choose your role in a mindful and specific way. I'm sure its the same way for nearly every class. If you can't see how this would massively change the perspective of classic I'm not sure how one could lay it out more clearly.   
---
A tank chose to be a tank, knowing full well the consequences and delights of such a choice. A healer the same. They scarified part of their game play to help their guild, help their party. This helps weave the texture of community that has been eroded over time. If a player can do everything at a whim then they don't need anyone else, and vanilla was all about your guild. All about your raid. I hate BFA not so much for its mechanics and play but because no one fucking talks. Its miserable to do dungeons with people who say nothing and whom I'll never see again. 
---
Happened to me in bc on a flight path using far sight or something on my shaman
---
Reserve? 
---
Yeah Gearscore wasnt a Blizzard thing until they just went straight to ILVL in Cata. But the inherent issue that caused Gearscore to happen, is making every piece of armor tied perfectly to item level. As in, Naxx is X stats at 100%, Ulduar, is X stats at 120%, and so on, instead of having some of the more weirdly configured stats in Vanilla and even BC to an extent.
---
Yeah I had some fun in the ICC dungeons. Compared to the loot they dropped, they still weren't comparable to BC heroics, but they were harder than Vanilla's 5 mans, which is nice.
---
most calculations are wrong because people forget the vanilla feeling to become camped half a day. or when some other killing your quest mobs.
---
same problem 60 without gold is no really 60.
---
the normal player will need 3-6 months to get raid ready and LVL 60
---
Goldfarm for enchants and pots 2000 Gold including Epic mount and Professions.
---
and the complete T0 set or similar items.
---
Then many people need the keys for dungeons and the prequest for Ony, BWL, MC
---
Even when Someone is the first LVV60 on server there dont find groups who helps him in Dungeons because there are days away form 60.
---
You make an AQ20 and reserve the books. 
---
Wow fuckin released November 23rd my dude this wasn‚Äôt at launch.  This is beyond irrelevant. 
---
I sure hope it stays that way. 
---
No one started at 1.1 unless they were in beta.  Patch 1.1.1 was November 13th or something and wow released the 23rd. 
---
I‚Äôm glad they aren‚Äôt using beta wow mechanics either  
---
make no sense to go in green. in my vanilla time only blues with enchants and no rogues are allowed for the raid.
---
maybe some groups will try to be the first. but you will not be one of them.
---
This was never in the live game.  You moron. 
---
I think higher ilvl items could work if the improvement was so marginal and the difficulty was so great that the items were trophies more than anything. But such items should definitely be few and far between. They should put far more emphasis on alternatives to existing gear than replacements for existing gear. I'll be happy when there's a set and a Legendary for every spec.
---
I think there are solutions to both of those issues, that aren't too clunky or invasive. Introduce LFD for 1-60 or 1-70 content, because the older worlds are just too empty to form groups from 1 server. However, disable it for Northrend, because there is always a booming relevant population to assemble groups for in Northrend. It solves the issue LFD was created for, yet the main content is still kept as a part of the world, and not an instant portal-across-the-continent-mobile that pairs you with strangers you will never see again.
---
As far as badges, I guess keep Justice for Naxx10/5mans, Make Valor only drop from Naxx 25/Uld 10, Conquest from Uld 25/ToC10 etcetera. It's the same thing as it was, but it keeps Heroic AFK fests away from giving seriously powerful gear.
---
Idk why you got downvoted it was never in the live game this was a beta patch 
---
Man, but simply denying loot trading flat out and increasing the number auto reporting to 100% would be so much better solutions that also don't increase GM numbers.
---
What about something like this:  
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/raid-composition#0ggyvthjvjshhjjsfhjjsccccxFFFwsnpppsyywyq
---
I feel like this build may be more realistic for pugs or early start guilds.
---
How often do you get more than 4-5 shamans in a pug or raid?  
---
8 shamans is a lot and makes it hard for me to pick priest.  
---
My main point is I want to be needed/utilized in a raid and a raid needing 8 shamans makes it tough for me to go priest.  
---
Are their usually many shamans for this? Are all healers needed in general?
---
Your vanilla time is long long over my clueless friend. 
---
It's probably worth it to keep the locks, if you want to have devoted and geared members for when you progress AQ40/Naxx. MC and BWL have their hard moments, but if you're planning on killing Kel'Thuzad, those warlocks shouldnt be a roadblock when they're less powerful.
---
You're comparing what, Ret to Enh for pvp?  Your phrasing is weird, like you're comparing Holy to Enh.  Both healing spec classes are good for pvp and pve. Both melee dps specs aren't great.
---
40 mage
---
Humans only have the advantage if they go combat swords. As a dwarf you can go combat daggers which does more dps anyway and it‚Äôs far easier to get good daggers than swords. 
---
Pvp wise, dwarf is god tier especially for rogues. Being able to remove bleeds, poison and blind is a colossal advantage for a rogue. You‚Äôre highly underestimating the power of stoneform. 
---
Perception is only nice in 1v1 rogue duels because you have to premeditate it. 
---
Wouldn‚Äôt that be very similar to the enhancement stromstrike skill?
---
8 days played is 12-20 days real time days
---
&gt;Is human decent in pvp against Mages/Warriors/Hunters/devouring plague?
---
Yes. I think you're overvaluing race here. Racial abilities are good in their niches, but it's not the deciding factor for 90% of fights. Other things matter a lot more - like, did you get the opener? Are CB and Prep off cd? What about ice block? 
---
&gt;Would a dwarf/gnome be decent in pve with swords/daggers should I choose either of them?
---
Human has the edge in PvE because of sword spec, but all 3 do just fine. The racial amounts to having around 1% hit.
---
&gt;Am I underestimating perception in pvp?
---
Probably, your stealth detection range is bonkers with perception up, but it's only useful when you know there's another stealther around.
---
&gt;Am I overestimating stoneform/escape artist?
---
Maybe. They're both good at what they're used for. Remember escape artist won't prevent new snares/slows from being applied, and stoneform is only useful against a handful of classes.
---
&gt;What is more useful in casual wpvp perception/stoneform/escape artist?
---
This is a pretty unanswerable question, because it would mean we'd have to know how you're planning to approach wpvp and what kind of encounters you're going to get in. With stealth, almost all of your wpvp better be initiated by you, so you're going to be picking and choosing your fights.
---
As an undead rogue, I covet escape artist the most for dealing with hunters and mages, but frost reflector is just as good if you can time it correctly.
---
In the end just play what you want because they're all fine.
---
Well. Plus loot acquisition via raids was really slow. 
---
Which imo made it harder for one to solely obsess about raiding. When you can expect to, generally, pick up a piece or two of loot, across 12-16 hours of raiding, it‚Äôs hard for that activity to be the core focus of your gameplay. 
---
When raiding is endless stretches of routine activity punctuated by infrequent rewards, one simply can‚Äôt *live* for loot in the same manner you could in later expansions. 
---
As you mention, in the Vanilla raiding context, your relationships with guild mates are (or at least were, in retail) a bigger motivation to raid than the loot. 
---
So again, less about raiding, more about friendships. 
---
I wonder if there's any way to build off the lore that existed during vanilla in such a way as to make Alexstrasza herself the final boss of Grim Batol. I don't know enough about what lore did and didn't exist at the time to say whether or not such an event could conceivably happen.
---
The turnover rate is sky high in vanilla. By the time you‚Äôre in AQ/Naxx you will have replaced 20% of your core. You can easily adjust your raid composition as you progress through Classic. 
---
you're correct, I wasn't entirely sure when it released in US but we never had to pay reagents for regular buffs in the final version of the game. Aside from things like slow fall and levitate, of course, but that's a different story
---
They get absolutely hammered by mages
---
I was on discord the other day and people argue that it's actually easier to get good swords for raiding? Argument against would be that if everyone is rolling a human rogue then competition would be a lot higher for swords.
---
Obviously, horde players don't have any fancy sword specializations and they are doing just fine on the other side of the pond.  Undead rogues arguably have the worst pve bonuses but everyone plays them.
---
I suppose for me it would be a question if stoneform beats escape artist. Escape artist would help against horde of mages but then I can just spec into improved sprint. 
---
He's got you there. Technically his net worth should be higher than some  EO. That's if the CEO is doing anything for the firm whatsoever.
---
You are required to take those classes, yes.  But for a lot of people, playing the role people don't want (the support class) is appealing.  You generally didn't have trouble finding people to play that role.
---
My favorite expansion was TBC, and this was basically the class design in TBC.  I raided heavily in TBC.
---
The pure player wouldn't feel like an idiot when he gets into a raid and pumps out a ton of DPS because of buffs from the support class.  Players in Vanilla or TBC begged to have support players in their group for just that reason.
---
12 hours at day is not that much
---
Can't you min/max that comp by moving the marks hunters into melee groups ? Or is there a bigger benefit to the resto shamans for them (do they stand close enough for windfury totem?) I haven't played enough horde to know how resto shamans are best used but I agree that there wouldn't likely be 8 resto shamans in most guilds, plus you want at least some variety in healers for poison/curse/magic removal across all raid content.
---
Then the fat bearded dwarf it is then. 
---
Like I said in the previous comment, horde doesn't have fancy sword specialization and they are doing just fine in pve. 
---
I think find treasure racial seals the deal for me.
---
The thing is, eventually unless they add in TBC or new content the game will 1000% start to die out. Look at OSRS for a good example. They implemented the same idea. Classic OSRS no changes etc. After a while the population started to dwindle.
---
They introduced community polling adding in ideas in the spirit of OSRS. Game now has 2x the number of players "retail" runescape has.
---
Dont get me wrong I'm going to play the ever living SHIT out of vanilla. But ultimately adding in either TBC or vanilla spirited content would not only completely reinvigorate the game, but would give all vanilla vets a brand new experience in the spirit of vanilla.
---
Well if you put all the hunters together then they would get agi totem and not WF. I don't understand the point of separating them personally. I just wanna know first-hand experience of the amount of resto shamans in a guild raid/pug
---
It wasn‚Äôt released like this in any version of the game it was 100% beta.  People on here are acting like ‚Äòold  school‚Äô players trying to gate keep but it was only in beta like. 
---
Disclaimer: MC/BWL are easy and you will not have problem with them unless all 40 of you refuse to read about encounters, gear up, consumable, etc. Composition won't hold you back. However, that won't stop us from min/maxing right? There is fun in that too. :)
---
My initial reaction is that you have too many shaman healers. Correct me if I'm wrong, but casters just get mana from totems right? They can swig mana pots and use mana/5 consumables if mana is a problem. One way to not let mana be a problem is to bring more rogues. Their higher dps will end the fight quicker.
---
I'd only bring 4 locks for curses. 1 shadow priest for debuff. You could bring a feral bear tank. They do highest threat per second in game and highest damage after tanking in game. A fury warrior in defense gear will be out damaged by a feral bear in tank gear. Plus, you bring the crit aura and more reliable fairie fire as well.
---
For healers, I'd like more priests and druids. Druids innervate the priests so they can spam with reckless abandon to keep people alive, and druids bring more battle rezes. A high dps fury warrior dies early? Dr. B. Rez. the the rescue.
---
Take everything above with a grain of salt though. It is a 40 man composition so you have room to tinker especially in MC/BWL.
---
One of the original devs talks about the Paladin design... it does make sense(to me at least :) )
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rd-Zt8bueFk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=4977
---
My guess is that they used these items in development, just as easy-to-find placeholders for testing purposes.
---
My first 60 ever playing on vanilla p serv  took me about 10 days having zero idea of quests items etc.
---
I was never into world PvP either. It's pure cancer. If that's what flying did to you (removed your ability to grief lowbies), then good!
---
I was so excited for Cata, but it really was a major letdown.  I thought I wanted it, but I didn't.
---
Only restricted on PvP servers you could have both factions on the same PvE server.
---
not compared to actually having hit and crit
---
What is your guilty pleasure in WoW Classic?
---
Mine is when I'm on a skinner, and I'm following a frost mage who doesn't have skinning.
---
Ah, I can't say. I haven't played on any private server to confirm that. I'm basing this on my vanilla memories from over a decade ago. I could be wrong. At least we agree that it doesn't give direct control like the priest version.
---
This interview hasn't really been seen by a lot of people, but I advice people with questions to watch it [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAKvIx6eQpA&amp;t=](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAKvIx6eQpA&amp;t=)
---
You will obviously not be able to play alliance and horde on the same realm and from what I heard in the video I linked, they will most likely even remove the right-click add friend option on the enemy faction's portrait to avoid cross-faction teamwork and what not as much as possible.
---
Yea I would strongly advise against playing on big streamer's servers. Big faction imbalance and hundreds if not thousands of players playing solely to pander to their favorite streamer. It basically takes over the server.    
---
They probably also didn't care. They had everything on farm anyway and just gave it to their most deserving member. 
---
Holy is actually pretty optimal if you get 5/5 wand spec in disc and 5/5 spirit tap and 2/2 improved shadow word pain in shadow as your first priority. Check out my priest leveling [guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7iieiw/priest_leveling_guide/) for more detail.
---
Well its quite simply really.
---
Dwarf.
---
Master.
---
Race.
---
I loved flying in bc and wrath but if I could go back and remove it forever I would. Ruined world pvp and the sense of exploration. Feel like it was more work for the team to make areas players could possible fly by to not look like crap.
---
As I mentioned, it can be in group PvP as you describe, but does it have any other uses at all?
---
Perfect video for you: https://youtu.be/8YCBd1VZVb4
---
There‚Äôs an even bigger difference between early and late cats. Cats at launch before any nerfs is the best wow was with an expansion.
---
3-4  Marksman Hunter no Survival and no BM. 
---
No Rogues replace it with other dd.
---
3 Hunter rotation with Tranq Shoot is optimal in BWL.
---
I did priest in Vanilla. Leveling and dungeons were fun. World pvp and messing with dudes with Mind Control is superb. Hiding on zepplins and MC dudes off mid flight is great.
---
I hated raiding. No spot for shadow priests really in a raid group. You spend your time looking at 40 green bars get lower. All over the screen. It's hard to even take in the experience properly in the large raids I found.
---
But in dungeons I found it good fun and you're always going to get a group when you type "Holy Preist LFG".
---
Welp. Not a cryptominer for sure haha. A plugin update messed something up, I think we can solve it soon! 
---
Huh. Serious players will hit 60 within a month following release. Playing 8-16 hours every day...
---
I love doing dungeons as a healer, one of my fav features in the game
---
100% I would roll a pally if they had crusader strike. It's such a shame 
---
Exactly, reason being is that Shaman's abilities scale better and better the more you have (i.e. grounding totem, tremor, shocks, chain lighting, chain heal, etc.).
---
Even a enhance shaman which is honestly kinda shit, add an elemental shaman and suddenly that storm strike + Lightning combo can easily global anything.
---
You need 6 warlocks in MC/BWL gear to maintain 100% uptime on Improved Shadow Bolt, this is assuming 1 shadow priest in the comp as well. 
---
I mentioned the use in group PvP, yes. Bit this crowd control is very weak compared to abilities of other classes, both in PvE and PvP, as it breaks on any damage, restricts movement but not actions, can be cast only on one mob at a time, and is not useable in most dungeons and raids in the first place.
---
Good point about the cooldown, but it's not that long given the duration of roots themselves, and I imagine not many fights, especially mob fights, need more than one root per fight anyway. I wonder if roots and grasp count as the same ability? If not, you could at least root two mobs instead of one, making both more useful.
---
The reason why I came up with this question is I noticed the "improved entangling roots" talent in balance tree. It removes the pushback on damage while casting. But since we have the instant cast ability that does the same, I can't imagine any situation in which this talent could be of any use.
---
It‚Äôs also worth considering this when running so few warriors. Unless you don‚Äôt plan to finish Naxx as a goal. If you have aspirations of killing KT, you will need 8 warriors with T2 tank gear and 4 piece T3. 
---
The story was FANTASTIC though. 
---
I had NO IDEA what was coming when I stumbled upon the wrath gate at the end of that quest line. That was INCREDIBLE. And that‚Äôs just one thing. Let alone everything to do with Arthas from the first steps in Northrend to Icecrown Citadel itself.
---
Also, the music was fantastic. 
---
Good luck sheeping with a  3 dead mages and grounding totem.
---
I feel like during vanilla Gnomish Death Ray and Sappers still did damage even with divine shield on, as it was self inflicted damage.
---
Honestly, Raid Finder is when Cata turned. It was a pretty solid expansion for the most part before that happened.
---
Okay, so, in a perfect world - after Naxx has been out for two years give or take, what kind of changes do you think the community would vote in favor of? Horizontal content like a 20 man Kara raid slotted between AQ and Naxx? Or how about  Azshara Crater BG, Grim Batol dungeon/raid, Ironforge Airport. Or would it have to be entirely original content? 
---
You can kind of use it for solo kiting, but since it prevents you from doing anything useful at range, it would be very, very long. The nature's grasp can at least help with gaining distance to heal yourself, instead of keeping distance for no other purpose but wait for a very slow DoT to work its way. I suppose it's good to use on a melee mob that outlevels you and can't heal itself, if you really need to kill it now rather than coming back later when you can kill it much, much faster by conventional means, but I really would prefer the latter.
---
Running up to a node and mining it while someone from the opposing faction is fighting the mobs near it. I don't do it to same faction players but the enemy is fair game. 
---
My cousin and I were druid and Rogue (him). We would often 2v1 in TBC early on in the arena when we hit 70.
---
There were a LOT of matches vs other stealth teams where legit 5 minutes would go by and we couldn't find each other. Forutnately druids came with stealth detection with our cat form imp stealth talent so we ususally got the jump.  And druids with mangle in bear form were op as fuck against melee early on in TBC -- usually an easy win.
---
I can't speak for later on in TBC as my group all quit within the first year of TBC.
---
It locks their maximum movement speed to a certain number, I believe it's 100% aka base movement speed
---
Good point!
---
I'm eager to try classic but I frankly don't know if it will be my jam. I do hope it's successful though. 
---
If it really takes off though, I'm kinda hoping it essentially becomes WoW 2 with its own expansions instead of just getting BC and WoTLK rereleases 
---
Yeah, the story in Wrath was the best it ever was or would be. 
---
I was so disappointed in Cataclysm. At first I was excited, saw it as a WoW 2 where I could make a brand new character and explore a new world again. But the new world sucked and wasn't challenging enough. 
---
Still kinda a dick move even if it's opposing factions.  Also, something that only occurs on a PvE server since on a PvP server you'd likely get a fireball to the ass for pulling a move like that.
---
Useful for raids? Go mage then
---
&gt; Reagents for single target spells would have changed your opinion on that pretty quickly I am going to wager.
---
I dunno, I remember handing out soulstones for rag and having my entire inventory full of shards. I think I would have survived..... But I also played a mage from day 1. And despite not being able to prove it, the single target AI buff never costed a reagent like this patch note claims.
---
I have no proof, but I swear its true.
---
Unless you're an orc rogue (or really any orc) fighting another rogue. Even if you don't get the jump, at any one time your racial stun resist WILL kick in and totally turn the tables. Even worse for the alliance rogue if you get the jump and their desperation stun to escape resists.
---
Dwarf racial is decent against other rogues to get out of bleed/poison to re-stealth or escape, warriors to be able to do the same, or against hunters to sprint an escape.
---
More of a survival tool to get out of a bad situation than an offensive weapon like horde racials (berserking, WOTF, Stun/Blood Fury).
---
Still the best PvP race for alliance.
---
The racials are not that important.
---
You are overthinking this way to hard. 
---
Mage unless you like healing. 
---
You will never have that many shamans.
---
More rogues is always a good idea, especially early content.
---
5 warlocks is overkill
---
2 Shadow Priests are 1 to much.
---
I agree, even made a spreadsheet with data. In the end just went for my Ironforge party team with best looking beard.
---
I think it is absolute madness to spend so much on that garbage weapon and dungeon drop weapons are a better choice.
---
Blight requires lvl 45, and if you are desperate for a new weapon around that level range you should be able to get that 2h axe from the Feralas questchain at the Witch doctor long before lvl 45.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=10652
---
Are you going to be playing super hardcore? If the answer is anything but yes just play what you like the most.
---
This is how I would do it. Making the Enhance shaman the designated nightfall-axe guy, one holy is a shadow weaver, and at least one fury is a go to off tank. This seems like a little better loot split as well with some dagger rogues and a rather even class break down.
---

---
Enchanting is the default pairing skill to go with Tailoring.   Skinning for vendor gold is all well and good but mining is one of those skills you want to pick up from the start since it's such a pain to level.
---
The short answer is there's no right answer.  It's all on how you want to give your character an edge.  Do you want to make extra money, do you want to fill in gaps in your own gear.  Don't think that going a regular pairing such as LW+Skinning, BS+Mining, or Tailor/Enchanting, etc is going to cause you to lose money.  If you do it right you can find niche markets for things in demand.  Every class has them it's just a matter of knowing when the market comes online in the timeline of progression.
---
Shadow is fine after aq40 you just put them in the group of heals and become a mana battery. 
---
Most guilds will have 1 or 0 shadow priests. 
---
To adapt a William Wallace line from the Braveheart movie:  "Every game dies.  Not every game really lives"
---
Mana battery is TBC thing, not vanilla one. 
---
lol, as if they weren't coming anyway.
---
Blight isn't a bad choice. The 40s is a tough place for warriors in general and alot of it has to do with the shortage of good 2hers. I think I used WWaxe well into the 40s. The only thing against polearms is there isn't a bonus specing for them but again, in the 40s that's not too much of a concern. 
---
100% uptime on ISB is not better dps than another fury warrior. They're just too good early on.
---
And what do you do while that warrior is rooted? Roots break on any damage. Gaining distance can be useful. Keeping distance, however, much less so, and is very situational.
---
What's the name of the song playing at the very end of the video? Straight nostalgia.
---
You can almost make the same statement for every tech company when compared to 2008 or 2009
---
you're one of the first guys ive seen from a retail vanilla video that actually used keybinds :D seems like you had a pretty good computer for 2006 as well, nice framerate 
---
Subscription for wow classic need to be separated, most of classic fans will agree. Many will pay more if needed. No touching  points with current expansion needed . If they bound together, i can go to the store get some tokens, sell them in classic wow( thru retail wow ). Most likely will be websites with small fee who can do that for you, or with other methots suggested . Get some epics. Win.
---
It depends on what you mean by ‚Äúeasier.‚Äù A good mainhand sword drops from Onyxia, and she is a pretty easy boss that will probably be farmed weekly by many guilds, but there are a lot more dagger drops in vanilla raiding overall. Plus once Naxx drops you can farm a Naxx trash drop dagger that will basically last you until Naxx boss loot weapons or the dagger off of C‚Äôthun if you can get that.
---
Finally, you will get loot competition for swords from other rogues as well as fury warriors, whereas competition for daggers is rogues only. The main downside to daggers is that solo farming is much much faster and easier with swords. Oh, and the answer is dwarf. Scottish alcoholics beat stunted tech geeks. Oftentimes literally.
---
I've played on both PVP and RP-PVP servers. There isn't a whole lot of difference except for a few things. The community on an RP-PVP server tends to be more mature, both in communication, and in player names. You won't run into players named "iganku" for example. Players actually have to come up with a creative, fantasy player name. 
---
/emotes are also used more frequently, which I find to be a refreshing change from what you'd typically see on a non RP server. 
---
Paladins too!
---
Root had a chance to break on damage, like fear. Use your fucking imagination; /dance while your mate buddy gets a free pyroblast off. Perhaps the warrior was carrying the WSG flag and you‚Äôve now allowed the rest of your team to catch him. Seriously, if you can‚Äôt think of a reason why a 36 yard range 1.5 second cast root is good, I don‚Äôt know wtf you‚Äôve been doing in WoW all these years
---
As a rogue I never got a sword or a good dagger. So I played with claw of the black dragon.
---
Dps wise I was on the same lvl like sword rogues.
---
You might never get any drop. This is classic
---
It was only in TBC that SoJ limited movespeed. R1 SoJ only has the same effect as curse of recklessness (can‚Äôt run away, immune to fear) and R1 is the only rank available in vanilla. 
---
Rank 2 of SoJ, which was only available in TBC, is what limits movespeed to 100%. 
---
R1 (only rank available in vanilla):
---
&gt; Unleashing this Seal's energy will judge an enemy for 10 sec, preventing them from fleeing. 
---
R2 (TBC version):
---
&gt; Unleashing this Seal's energy will judge an enemy for 20sec, preventing them from fleeing and limiting their movement speed.
---
Curious-Why do you emphasize VE and Shadow Weaving in the tri-spec? It seems that without Shadowform, those points would be better spent elsewhere (such as Shadow Reach for Mind Flay CC, or topping off Holy Specialization).
---
I like that you have 5 points in Spirit Tap, that would make this build quite good for grinding as well.
---
For those of you that are curious, McConnell responded

---
Yes, the difference in the fact that it can be used at a distance. But why keep that distance if you can't do anything on that distance anyway? Roots break on any damage. I mean, you can isolate one of the mob/player while you deal with the others, so yes, that can be situationally useful. I guess the thing that bothers me is the "improved entangling roots" talent that is also mostly useful in melee only.
---
I just checked and it was only during TBC that SoJ limited movement speed, it might be memories from the TBC prepatch?
---
Priest holy spec (smite/holy fire) actually has some of the higest DpME spells of the entire class arsenal.  The difference is smite is relatively slow to kill things unless you go deeper into the holy tree for related talents. 
---
@Squillie
---
 Just a word of caution to anyone leveling shadow.  Mind Flay is one of the worst DpME spells for priest.  It looks like it's a good bread and butter spell but it actually doesn't become even remotely mana effecient until you get Rank 5 Mind Flay along with Shadow Weaving+Darkness talents.
---
[http://theskyrimblog.ning.com/group/glitches/forum/topics/hearthfire-an-alchemist-s-dream](http://theskyrimblog.ning.com/group/glitches/forum/topics/hearthfire-an-alchemist-s-dream)
---
This is going to be the best solo grinding/leveling build/pvp build there is as far as I'm concerned.  Feel free to put points into Unbreakable Will instead of Improved PW:S if you pvp heavily or roll on a PvP server.
---
Your build order for talents pre 40 is 5/5 Spirit Tap&gt; 5/5 Wand Spec&gt;2/2 SW:P&gt;3/5 Shadow Focus&gt;5/5 Mind Blast&gt;Mind Flay.  From there the rest is pretty obvious.  
---
\*Ignore Blackout early on.  It looks like a good early talent but actually is better later on.  You shouldn't be relying on randomly proc'd stuns anyways.
---
\*3/5 Shadow Focus is plenty.  No need to go 5/5 unless you're guild is allowing you to raid as shadow.  3/5 will cover natural increased resists for mobs up to 2 levels higher than you.  NEVER fight mobs 3 levels higher period. (This goes for any class, but especially for spellcasters.)  The scaling of resisting spells from 2 -&gt; 3 levels higher is something like 16% natural resist chance by default.
---
\*Mind Blast 5/5 early on.  There's debate on how many points you actually need to put into this for efficient rotations.  My say on this is: if you're playing shadow, watch your rotations, if you start to feel like you can get away with 2/5 or 3/5 mind blast, try it out.  
---
\*Get mind flay, but don't use it early on unless you're preventing an npc from running or killing a player.  It scales better with spellpower gear and with later talents/ranks of the spell.
---
\*Don't get improved vampiric embrace.  Just don't.
---
Mage is definitely a safer bet in every way. 
---
Shadow priests are great in 1v1 and similar pvp situations but not really wanted by premades. They are also viable to some extent in pve if you are super hardcore since you need every consumeable possible all the time for any decent guild to even consider bringing you along. 
---
While mage on the other hand is great in all kind of pvp situations and also requires quite low effort in pve to be succesful by vanilla standards. 
---
Make sure you make some Youtube videos using this tool so it gets high visibility and seen by Blizzard; that's the sole reason I made it.
---
Back in Vanilla I PVP'd as shadow in a premade with high warlords, and also healed end-game raids. I just got used to eating the 50g x 2 respec cost, because I found that I was not happy either in PvP or PvE in less-than-optimal specs.
---
I understand the urge to find a one-size-fits-all spec but 100g is not that much as a level 60 in an end-game guild. Sure, I was never rich, but I was never completely broke, either. Levelling an alt that is fun and good at farming can also help with the costs (Hunter, Rogue, etc.)
---
I had a dream last night that they announced a plan to release up to WotLK after Classic. With an included bonus to have dynamic dungeons and raids that scaled gear and mobs to the average level of your group‚Äôs ILvL. 
---
I was stoked and then sad when I woke up and realized it was just a dream.   
---
Yeah it was this weird, hidden gem where suddenly one of our shamans was obsessed with getting full t1, then upon doing so was doing stellar healing with healing wave and such. Wild.
---
5 druids
---
Come on now, saving 15-30s while looting isn‚Äôt going to make or break the economy, considering it takes forever to drink back to full mana and round up a decent chunk of mobs. 
---
Instance farming DM:T for 150g/h is going to screw over the economy, not aoe looting. 
---
I‚Äôm as nochanges as it gets but you shouldn‚Äôt be spreading nonsense just because you‚Äôre against changes. Use actual arguments instead of ‚Äúhurr hurr breaks the game‚Äù when it very clearly doesn‚Äôt break the game. 
---
i've been looking for this video forever. 
---
I'd have to go find the thread where I talked about it with another who played it out. Talents on the way to silence aren't as important as silence itself, so really you could go any talents you want. The whole point is you want to be a really annoying and evasive healer, which is even more complimented by the blackout + shadowguard.   
---
I might go this build to level with my warrior friend but you are right, might as well go shadowform for pure leveling DPS. However for bg PvP, I do not suggest shadowform as you will be more valuable not having to shift in and out of it to heal. Mana isn't too important as you can drink more in PvP. 
---
Not really. Hearth to Kargath then run over there. It takes 2 mins. Alliance port to Stormwind and run from Thorium Point or from the FP in Burning Steppes after flying there. 
---
Every horde raiding guild puts their hearth in Kargath because it‚Äôs the closest hub to Blackrock Mountain = MC and BWL. 
---
Run AQ20 and get them or buy them on the AH. They usually only have outrageous prices for the first few weeks after AQ20 comes out. After that, the demand plummets since most raiders have them while the supply keeps increasing as people keep running AQ20 for rep/loot. 
---
Stomp melees and lose to casters because they are too slow to even get to them. 
---
Totally a dick move. And yes, in vanilla it was a PVE server. But you asked for guilty pleasure, not examples of my shining morality. 
---
I still don't understand why Legion was so praised. Was it because WoD was so shit?
---
Really just needs a whole melee dps group with a feral OT. 
---
Try going with a power infusion build? and then make good friends with an ele shaman, POM mage, or warlock.
---
[Try something like this?](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVMGsMiaosxt0f)
---
You need 3 warlocks for curses. Lock damage is garbage during MC/BWL because they have 0 spell hit until ZG. You aren‚Äôt running 6 locks for ‚Äú100% uptime on ISB‚Äù unless you really want to meme around. 
---
Enhancement shaman should be talented for improved weapon totems and improved enchancing totems and either put in the rogue/warrior dps group or the hunter group. (usually melee though since they benefit more)
---
Most likely.
---
Little late to the discussion but why do you feel that achievements were bad for the game?
---
You don‚Äôt need 4pc T3 for 4HM. 
---
Yeah if you can find it I'd read it. Very interested in Priest meta.
---
The shadow reach + mind flay seems to fit the bill for the kind of annoying healer you want. A well-timed Shadow Reach flay on a mounted or escaping enemy can mean the difference between him getting away and an easy kill. Plus without a pure shadow build, VE is going to be healing such a pittance, you probably won't even bother casting it in most battles.
---
If you are levelling with someone who expects a healer then that is a conundrum come 40 when Shadowform finally makes sense. Pre-40, the best builds are tri-specs anyway (Spirit Tap, Holy Spec and Wand Spec are all good enough deserve 5 points) so it wouldn't matter. For healing dungeons you can always just roll a bit higher level than recommended and your Shadow spec won't matter at all.
---
I'd be interested to see a warrior and a shadow priest levelling together, actually. The ability of Mind Blast to steal aggro, combined with hamstring and Mind Flay, means that you could potentially kill scores of mobs without having to take any damage. Plus, the warrior can just bandage himself or eat while you drink. When there's a particularly nasty pull, you can switch to holy after dropping half your mana on shadow DPS of course.
---
How many healers do raids generally bring out of 40 people for progression? And for 20 mans, do you just halve the number or are there other considerations? I'll be playing Alliance, but I'm interested in both sides just for academic reasons.
---
Decide if you want to be a healer or damage dealer in PvE. If that doesn't matter, then decide based on your faction. If you like PvP, you will probably want to go for some good racials.
---
Go mage if alliance or priest if horde. Mage on alliance doesn't have to deal with paladins and their blessing of freedom. Priests on horde have superb PvP racials. Undead have a neat dot and priests can fuck all kinds of people (especially rogues) over with their shadowguard and blackout combo.
---
Not much, honestly. Seems like there are some good PvP uses indeed, I didn't really do much PvP. I think a better question would be the use of "improved" talant in the balance tree, not the spell itself.
---
I thought buffing the tanks would be most important. Anyways I'm really just trying to find out how prevalent shamans will be late game as far as raid composition goes
---
I can tell from the way you write that you spend way too much time on the computer.
---
It would probably be beneficial for the game if Ony and MC were locked for the first month.
---
But I don't control what Blizzard does, and it seems both raids will technically be open on day 1.
---
Casters get threat reduction and healers get mana tide from shammies. You want 6+ shammies in an optimal raid comp although you won‚Äôt get that many outside of cutting edge guilds. 
---
The World of Warcraft sub is tied to both retail and Classic.
---
If you buy a token in Retail and use it for your sub, it extends your classic play time.
---
If anything ,this is a clever way for blizzard to still allow people to buy tokens with retail currency to be used on their WoW Sub, without needing to introduce WoW tokens into Classic directly.
---
The spriest shouldn‚Äôt be using VE so just through him in whatever group, doesn‚Äôt matter. 
---
Nature's Grasp vs Improved Entangling Roots are completly different stories. As you mentioned, improved ER really doesn't have a use. Pretty much no one picks that talent. 
---
However, ER still is very useful as a spell. Yes, it can break on damage, but so can fear. Will that stop Warlocks from using fear? No. Because it still works as a form of cc to give you a few seconds to do something.
---
Vanilla is filled with talents that don't make sense. 
---
They have prettttty different play styles. You should just go with which play style you enjoy more.
---
Did you *raid* as a Shadow Priest in Vanilla..? Shadow Priests are not good *or* fun to raid with in Vanilla, IMO. 
---
Much of TBC content was intended for 'Vanilla' before it became its own expansion content.
---
Not surprised to see items like this somewhere in the database.  Hell all of Karazhan and the zone is a place holder with no purpose in vanilla...
---
In PvE situations, extremely rarely. Feign Death is your go-to button to avoid anything getting close to you and losing precious dps time. That ability should be key-bound to a button that is close and that you are very used to pressing.
---
In PvP, you will have numerous situations where you will be doing melee damage. Most melee classes and sometimes cloth-wearing ones will try to get under your guns, in your dead range. At that point, if you are setup the right way, you can delete them pretty easily with your melee attacks, i.e. Raptor Strike, if they are wearing leather and cloth. You can achieve that by wearing the slowest two-handed weapon that has useful stats for you. Arcanite Reaper and Ice Barbed Spear are good examples of that. 
---
Mail and plate wearers have higher armor value, so less melee damage for you. Depending on the fight set-up and your opponent, it is perhaps better to reset the fight with Scatter Shot than trying to apply melee damage.
---
It is important to note that hunter melee damage does not suck and can be a true threat.
---
Yes I plan to go tri-spec til rank 4(?) of mindflay @ lvl 44. Then @ 55 or 56 Respec for healing dungeons.   
---
Yes VE is probably wasting effort, it would moreso be for having one talent offering a unique healing spell aka utility overall. You could def drop it.   
---
I am currently torn between maining shaman or good old priest which I always go, to combo with my warrior friend. Shamans have so much desire in raid it's tough to pick priest. But I absolutely love utility of priest. Mind control, pws, renew, group heal and the talent trees absolutely make me love priests. Not to mention I love healing and having lots of options.   
---
Anyways here's my pre-44 spec before full shadow: 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bA0MsZbZEMbz0h 
---
Definitely a certain sequence to how I prioritize what is first, weaving would be last to be picked. Again, troll priest for blackout procs on PvP server.  
---
I'll try and find the thread
---
Fear/Disorient and Silence/Interrupt with Concentration aura, what gives Stun resistance?
---
I do love healing, but I think I am leaning towards playing a DPS role. And, IMHO, gnomes make such great mages. I'll keep thinking about it, but maybe frost mage it is. 
---
Thank you, I see that now. My bad for lack of experience in PvP and bad wording of the question.
---
Orc Female for shooting animation. Melee, not so much to my liking.
---
Dwarf male feels like a "Shooting Carpet". For melee they can be  "Spinning Lawnmowers" with a long two handed weapon like Ashkandi.
---
Touch√®
---
Again you are wrong, any loot type can be traded just not equipped. 
---
Perception is a proactive CD. Stoneform and Escape artist are reactionary.
---
In BGs, I can see a druid "future flag carrier" heading towards a choke point and pop it or maybe use it in a duel. In world pvp, things can get way messier so I would lean towards reactionary CDs.
---
Just go combat daggers for pve my friend. Human weapon racial is more important for a warrior than a rogue.
---
Alternatively, you will be way more memorable as a gnome/dwarf on your server. There are so many human rogues. The horde will know you well if you kill them as dwarf/gnome though lol.
---
Sounds like u have enough commitment to make elemental shaman work. I always say go with what you want to play, not whats best for other people...
---
No matter how difficult it can be to find groups sometimes, you will not regret it like you would a warlock farming soul shards to summon peoples lazy a$$es.
---
I feel feral Druid is overhyped. The 3% crit aura can not outweigh the index 65 dps that a feral does compared to bringing another war or rogue 
---
Has there been any news since the release date announcement at Blizzcon?
---
Nope, talented they don't have a pushback, ant least that's how it is in vanilla. I didn't pose the question well. I see now that rooting can be useful in PvP. Improved rooting is useless though.
---
that's akin to the well-known PvP tri-spec build,...
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/af4ti2/just_for_fun_let_me_pick_your_classrace_using/edwhn1l?utm_source=reddit-android
---
Found it.
---
In PvE, humans do indeed have the edge over dwarves and gnomes, but not into such an extend to consider dwarves or gnomes meme races. You'll do just fine as any of the races.
---
In PvP, dwarves and gnomes have the edge over dwarves. Being a dwarf or a gnome can save your ass from time to time, whereas being a human doesn't. Either of the two races are fine, because neighter saves you from the ultimate rogue-busters of the horde. Who are they? Orc warriors and troll shadow priests. Orcs due to stun resist and trolls due to blackout shadowguard, which is arguably the most annoying thing ever for rogues. Fortunately for you, though, you can mostly pick your fights and evade these scenarios. It is then to decide which of the two races you like. Both are good against different classes. Dwarves against undead shadow priests and hunters and gnomes against mages and druids. As it was mentioned, escape artist might not be that crucial for a rogue as it is for warriors. 
---
Personally, I would go dwarf. Dwarves offer you advantages in PvP, are cool and good-looking. Gnomes are also good in PvP, but I hate their appearance and you can't really see gear on them. Humans are a bit too generic for me and they don't even give an advantage in PvP. Though if you are planning on doing the AQ black bug grind, then humans have to grind around 2000 less mobs, which is pretty neat.
---
Shadow priests are a good addition to the raid of your top DPSers are all warlocks, like it was for me. You get to do some damage and you will be a useful backup healer if something goes wrong, which it often did in my old raiding guild. 
---
I wonder if it makes any difference if you pick the "nature's reach" talent? Perhaps then you can cast the roots before he charges?
---
Hmm, no Holy Specialization? Those are my second 5 points (after Spirit Tap). An extra 5% crit is huge IMO, not just for healing, but also because Smite is still strongly in the rotation at that point. 
---
I then do Wand Specialization as those talent points will become useful right around lvls 19-20, when you get access to the Gravestone Scepter, which does insane wand damage for its level.
---
The next points are where it gets a little more subjective. In a pure min-maxing build, Shadow Focus is very important next as your level range opens up both against mobs and other players. I haven't done the maths (I'm sure there's a thread on here somewhere about it) but I've always felt 3 points in there is best insurance against resists. But Improved SW:P and, obviously, Blackout demand points as well.
---
The next points are also an important decision point. Are you pure DPS, in which case you probably want to get Improved Mindblast ASAP. Improved Mindblast is very important, in my opinion, but I guess it doesn't matter that much as for a good while Smite is going to be doing somewhat equivalent DPS. But choosing to level up Discipline first to get Inner Focus (very powerful) as well as Meditation is a legit choice as well obviously. Unbreakable Will makes sense for a PvP server, though for a soloing priest I feel like IMP: PW:S isn't a bad alternative considering how often you cast it.
---
And hell yeah, Troll Priest master race.
---
I totally understand the pull between Shaman and Priest. If I were a more skilled multi-tasker, I would be very tempted by Shaman for the reasons you listed. But the fact is, I always choose classes that are straight-forward, and Priest is the epitome of this in Vanilla.
---
Shaman just has so much potential. You can basically tank pre-end game dungeons as well, which must be super fun.
---
I support your decision - don't me wrong - but a lot of people are going to play mages. Unlike a lot of warriors and rogues, many people will also get to 60 as mages. There may be a over-population.
---
On the other hand, mages are a cool class to play for sure and if you genuenly like the appearance of gnomes, then maybe mage is a good option for you. 
---
If you wouldn't play dwarves, undead or trolls, who offer the most fun for priests, then playing a gnome mage may be better, but I don't want to support choosing based on racials. Just tell yourself which races you would choose for each of the classes and then choose the cooler race, if you like both classes.
---
Did you enjoy it? I was geared out as a Shadow Priest (dominated in PvP) but the times I tried to translate it to raids, I found it very lackluster. You run out of mana constantly, their spells just aren't built around efficiency. I found it more fun, personally, to heal raids and save shadow for PvP.
---
But yes Shadow Weaving can be an alluring debuff if your guild has some skilled/geared Warlocks.
---
I sure did. 
---
Oh, you are right! I thought the two talents in the holy tree were stun resist but they were disorient and fear resistance indeed. Thanks!
---
Nice. Did you transition to Shadow from Holy as you geared up? If so, what raid did this happen at?
---
What gear did you value, and what was your rotation?
---
It was loading pretty quickly as of last week, I think a plugin update might have slowed it down. I am working on the site right now. 
---
Mages are the kings of AoE and Warlocks are close second. Other classes have varying degrees of AoE spells. If you want AoE damage in raids or dungeons, you bring either of those classes. They're head and shoulders above the rest.
---
Priests/Paladins have their only AoE locked behind talents. Priests can somewhat aoe farm with their aoe while paladins can aoe farm by reflecting damage to mobs hitting them.
---
Hunters have multi-shot (hits 3 targets), volley and explosive trap. Volley is only useful on 20+ mob packs while explosive trap requires to get in melee and FD+trap.
---
Rogues have the worst AoE, as they only have a cooldown that lets them hit a second target. Extremely strong on 2-3 target fights but worthless in actual AoE fights.
---
Warriors have decent but limited AoE. It's mainly debuffs (thunderclap slows attack speed, demo shout reduces attack power) but they can Whirlwind to hit 4 targets around them and Cleave to hit an additional target with their basic attack. They also have a talent that allows them to hit a nearby secondary target (much like rogues would with their cooldown) but is limited to 5 hits.
---
Shamans have little AoE outside of their totems (one pulses damage every other second, the other does a burst and disappears) as they only have Chain Lightning, which chain hits up to 3 targets.
---
Druids don't have AoE abilities outside of Hurricane (which costs too much mana) and Swipe, which is limited to Bear Form (which means only tanks are going to use it).
---
You spend a few hours per week raiding cutting edge content, which even for a very average player is a tiny portion of your overall time playing the game. If you're planning on playing alot instead of just raid logging, not picking human is definitively smart. The best guilds on the server play with a full roster of highly competent and geared players who spend a massive amount of gold on consumables, while others play with overall decent players but don't stress about the rest because it isn't necessary.
---
The difference in output between these two rosters is tremendous and the better roster will kill bosses twice as fast, which means that they have twice the uptime on cooldowns, which means that even the best players in the worse roster will likely not reach the same average numbers that the worst players in the better roster do. Few bosses last more than a minute so your output doesn't have time to average out in a way that retail players are used to, so even the worst geared player in your raid could win damage done just by getting lycky with crits.
---
Being able to remove blind and poisons on a rogue is gamebreaking. Being able to remove frost novas on a warrior is gamebreaking. Playing human just because it mathematically is the best in raids is a noobtrap and we'll more than likely see the highend private server crowd play dwarf/gnome en masse because it's ten times more fun to plow noobs in the open world than it is to have 5 more weapon skill for a few hours every week.
---
Swords that drop should obviously go to the people playing humans first, but the good ones are rare so the queue is long. Having a couple of warriors that are okay with playing with Axes and rogues who are okay with playing Daggers evens out loot distribution and will definitively not be something you're looked down for. With all the saved DKP/Council Favor you can focus on getting tier or some dope trinket instead.
---
Iunno, man. Princess is level 51. I just don't see downing her with two and a 10 level difference. She hits hard.
---
Yeah, and if you compare gold prices from goldsellers and check how much gold you get for +- ‚Ç¨20 (i'm from EU) compared to the amount of gold you get from buying and then selling a WoW token its on average around the same. So either gold sellers or Blizzard seem to tune the token in retail to give gold according to the buy price of ‚Ç¨20 not the redeem value which the buyer gets. 
---
So i'm guessing sellers in Classic will also "tune" around that number, if they pick the "Redeem" value it will be around 250g Classic gold i reckon. 
---
Just picture him YELLING every other word.
---
I was about 14-15 at the time, so I had no idea what I was doing. I remember having some shadow-specific gear and some pieces of Devout. I started out as a Raid healer (leveled as Shadow) but then respecced back to Shadow. We just did MC and never got much more than halfway.
---
My rotation was SWP first, then Mind Blast and keep doing Mind Flay until Mind Blast was off cooldown, so just the usual Shadow Priest rotation back then.
---
The absolute tryhards will clear MC in the first two weeks without having a raid full of level 60s. Expecting them to take more than two weeks is being disconnected from reality. Consumeables make the fights ridiculously easier and you only need your MT and probs OT to have decent gear. 
---
Nobody is saying that everyone will clear MC in greens, but that the first people to clear MC/Ony will do so in greens because it's possible.
---
&gt; On your way to 60, YOU WILL HAVE PLENTY OF BLUE GEAR
---
Pro tip: the color of the gear doesn't mean jack shit if green items have better stats. Which is why mages use a handful of green +spell power items as their pre-bis.
---
That will be a question though, i feel that Blizzards anti botting techniques are getting pretty good. Atleast i feel that the number of bots has decreased dramaticly in WoW at some point during Legion. From one day to the other at that point in time i was seeing almost no bots anymore. I also think that one of the biggest bot developers closed up shop back then.  
---
What are you planning to roll when Classic comes around?
---
Stratholme with the red burning sky. Oof.
---
The undead crypt of Scholomance.
---
The abandoned castle of Shadowfang Keep, with the moonlit sky shining into the Courtyard.
---
Probably going Priest again actually. I'm currently leveling a Shaman as Enhance on a Private Server and not really feeling it (recently dinged 40). So then I'd rather stick with what I know.
---
Back then I had dreams of becoming the best shadow priest ever, but today I'm more tuned to the idea of staying relaxed and healing the raid, so then  Priests will be a superb choice.
---
But I'd still go Shadow if the guild wants it.
---
Stick with an orc shaman, but go elemental instead.
---
I think they should be bold and retool BC content so that it doesn't just wipe out existing classic content, maybe use some hellfire gear in molten core and have hellfire be so dangerous you want raid gear to easily quest there, have level 60 raids be a source of loot and exp to grind to higher harder dungeons instead of just wiping everything clean every expansion, make it so the expansions are new zones and new dungeons that while adding new levels, dont 100% wipe out literally everything that came before. naxx gear could be useful for raiding end game TBC content if you scale it right but you could maybe do it with 25 people because you are higher level.  
---
People would have incentives to revisit old content that still has good drops, but it would be opened up to more people as increases in level and other gear drops make it more accessible. AFter all only like 5% of people ever stepped foot inside most endgame raids. plus they have several expansions to work with and could retool gear to be on the ilevel curve of wow classic so that the epics in raids are better than blues from dungeons but not everyone raids, maybe the best loot up to 68 is in naxx but you can compete with the blues from outland 5 mans and quests.   
---
you'd have to rescale the entire TBC expansion but they have 2 years before any of it needs to go live and most of it is simple stat adjustments so that its ilevels are inline. rescaling dungeons and boss fights would be harder but could still be done and i think you would get more mileage than just releasing TBC as is in a couple years.   
---
If you want to evolve wow it should be to bring the new content in line with the original philosophy instead of just undoing it all every couple years.
---
Well, I don't mind achievements per se, but it comes with some negative consequences, like "link achiev to inv" when inviting to dungeon group/raid.
---
No, just occasional CM blue posts saying "they are still working"
---
Just quest. 
---
Yes and i hope so
---
Raiding is almost impossible without addons.  As a mage I have no idea who's cursed without recursive.
---
DM was out before most people even saw a raid, or hit 60. Especially true for non-US players, who only had a few weeks between release and DM. Hell, I think Rag wasn't even killed before DM was out. 
---
Also, on the blizzcon announcement, it was stated that the initial plan is to have DM out at release.
---
"and I imagine not many fights, especially mob fights, need more than one root per fight anyway"
---
sweet, summer child
---
In deciding which melee weapon(s) to equip, the impact on actual melee damage should have zero bearing unless the stats that benefit ranged are identical between the two items.
---
I realized that when I first zoned into Mount Hijal at the beginning of Cata and ... there was just something about the colors of the zone that didn‚Äôt set well with me.  Then was when my intuition said something‚Äôs not right here. 
---
&gt; https://classic.wowhead.com/raid-composition#0ggyvthjvjshhjjsfhjjsccccxFFFwsnpppsyywyq
---
On today's vanilla servers, resto shaman in the tank or melee groups usually can just drop mana tide/totem reduction cost talents and have enough points to pick up the Improved windfury totem and get some quality of life enhancement talents on the way. true enhance, actually doing damage, is horrrrrrrrrrible dps!
---
It‚Äôs called, ‚ÄúThe Shaping of the World‚Äù
---
I think eventually we'll have minor stuff for micro transactions. Hairdresser comes to mind.
---
Why are people on this sub so obsessed about this shit? Jesus christ. You'd imagine people who are hyped for a re-release of a 14 year old game would be a bit more mature, but this sub is so childish and pathetic at times
---
I respect your points made about holy specialization, I do plan on gravestone scepter to carry me a lot. This is a situational build purely because it's a troll build AND because I'll be leveling with a warrior. So we plan to dot many mobs at the same time, hopefully chain pulling. Smite could be important, but having a bigger Mana pool thanks to meditation is important for me. More I heal him the more damage we do.  
---
Shadow focus is recommended to get 3, but when you think about it, the third point you only get half it's usuage (mobs +2 lvls above have 5% chance to resist). so if the mob has no shadow resist youre wasting half a talent point and for what? To not miss 1% of hits? I'll take 1% on a 2+ mob, and anything below that will hit not matter what.
---
Cata was the most challenging content at first, that's why people quit.
---
Do you mean the 80-85 stuff? I was mainly referring to the 1-58 stuff. 
---
&gt; horde will know you well if you kill them as dwarf/gnome 
---
lol this is so true.  All of a sudden getting backstabbed by a creature shouting for KHAZ MODAN is a truly life changing scenario.
---
&gt;The end game of Vanilla is the journey through the world, not getting to the raids. 
---
As long as it is horizontal progression. Itemizing the gear for off specs would really help with balance without changing how the class plays fundamentally.
---
What is everyone‚Äôs favorite tier set from vanilla?
---
Should be running ZG alongside hitting up MC. 
---
By the way by "optional transfer" I meant copies.
---
But your Vanilla character loses all its gold so you can't dupe gold.
---
As a lazy dwarf player in the past, I was even struggling running from AH to the bank in IF let alone grind 2000 mobs. Just going to enjoy other riding on their bugs. 
---
Gnomes are quite cool too with their engineering bonus but I like both. Most likely will roll a dwarf because find treasure racial is the hidden gem.
---
That's great, nothing better than playing classic for the first with somebody who explains all the nostalgia around, have fun
---
But it‚Äôs 5 vs. 5 so the mages would just blanket the area with AoE and could rotate drinking endlessly. The rogues never get to open in them. Warlocks could do the same really. 
---
&gt; competition would be a lot higher for swords.
---
It usually is. I played Combat Dagger both on Retail Vanilla and... later, and the usual situation is: Everyone and their mother wants swords. Daggers are rather more niche, and even though some daggers are sought after by hunters as stat sticks (DFB, for example), others have *no* competition outside of Combat Dagger. 
---
I really like Stoneform because it also makes PvE life less of a headache - it removes Diseases (which in Vanilla can be a *real* PITA, frikkin' Silithid Pox/Rabies), it removes Poisons (including Slowing Poisons, which makes it situational better than EA, because it also applies an immunity for a few seconds), *and* it removes Bleeds. Which is really nice in those cases where you need to Vanish, and don't want a damage tick from a Bleed to uncloak you again.
---
That all said, my chosen race-class combo for Vanilla will be a Dwarven Rogue, so I may be a bit based.
---
So many seem to think Vanilla will fail, since they can't utter it without demanding expansions like flying mount TBC and more.
---
All +FP scorch builds. 
---
The jury's still out for me on Shadow Focus. After thinking about it, I agree however that 2 points is the best choice at 60 (it can be well argued that more might be better while levelling since you'll routinely grind mobs that are higher level than you). But this thread (based on research on a private server) makes it look like the extra points could help Fear and Silence land against other priests or paladins, even at 60. However it might just be a private server thing
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/8ws967/lesser_known_fact_about_the_resist_talents/
---
And yeah, I'm surprised that most builds I see posted on here ignore Holy Specialization. +5% crit at level 15 on all heals and smite/holy fire seems like a no brainer to me!
---
Tbh people that think its all nostalgia are full of shit and just being defensive about the astronomically inferior product that is retail.
---
Nobody needs their validation, the numbers speak for themselves.
---
And it's just my preference to save one point on shadow focus for other things. As for early talents, wand &amp; spirit tap are a no brainier. More Mana = more power.  
---
My dwarf priest build DEFINITELY incorporates holy specialization tho. If I go dwarf tho, I will not be Respeccing to shadow at all.   
---
Full on smite dwarf priest!
---
I wouldn't mind in the end. It's just funny how some people see it almost as a deal breaker if wow token is introduced in classic when in reality it might already be a part of it.
---
This is very well explained and I do enjoy dwarfs/gnomes a lot. 
---
Once you put things into time frame of reference, it does sound like rolling a race just for a few raiding hours per week is  a larger meme than rolling something to have quality of life open world perks.
---
I suppose it's time to prepare my engineering gizmos and start leveling that dwarf.
---
You don't see them because they're on other shards.
---
No rogues? Suppression room will be fun.
---
Should it not be the same effort wise? If farmspots are overfarmed etc. I think it would be reflected in token price
---
Not when ZG opens after BWL. Unless you hit 60 9 months after the server launches, you should already be past MC by the time ZG opens up.
---
And if it takes you that long to hit 60, the "optimal" raid comp is the least of your worries.
---
Leveling was never hard, it was simply time consuming, due to reasons, explained by John staats,however the dungeon content can be rivaled only by tbc
---
We're not even talking about the same thing. Get your head into the same subject before saying I'm wrong. :^)
---
Finding good locks (especially on alliance) can be challenging. You want to start collecting them as soon as possible. As long as your tank gets tfury relatively fast it doesn't take long for warlocks to shine. Bloodvine from ZG helps a ton but even before that you can compete with rogues/warriors on long fights like nef/rag if you can get your hands on the good t2 items. Things like bracers of arcane accuracy, band of forced concentration, neltharions tear, staff of shadowflame. These BWL drops are on par with AQ and even naxx items. If you can manage to get these items early, combined with bloodvine, you'll be a real force to be reckoned with matching or even beating your main ignite mages going into AQ and naxx.
---
Still wrong though. 
---
Also no one who plays druid seriously is going to spec down to Nature's Reach in the Balance tree
---
all useless if gov wants anything to do with you  
---
&gt; OP was suggesting the Chef wasn't going to do any more dishes in the future.
---
I suggested the Chef wasn't making perfect steaks anymore and instead was trying to pass off frozen burritos.
---
&gt;Him offering piano lessons on the side doesn't mean he's not making new dishes in the kitchen.
---
Correct, he is still making new dishes but they all suck.
---
Again his dishes have sucked consistently since he started working on the side and they are getting worse over time.
---
&gt; All the biggest Chefs in town are making new dishes AND teaching kids piano.
---
The other chefs were already making frozen burritos in the first place, you couldn't tell the difference.
---
I still think of WoTLK as the epitome of wow. Definitely my best time with it despite people saying it was the beggining of the decline. 
---
I raided everything. Coming back to naxx IN FREAKING NORTHREND was amazing. Sartharion was great. The culling of Stratholme was great. Ulduar is still arguably one of the best raids in the game.
---
ToC despite everyone hating it was one of my favorite times in wow (I played a paladin, so the "Knight" themes were awesome) the dungeon was innovative, and the pvp boss in ToC raid is still one of my favorites.
---
ICC patch is probably my favorite patch of all time. The three dungeons of ICC were freaking amazing. Just cool as fuck design with some very interesting bosses. Quel'delar (the sword you got from the broken hilt) is still one of my favorite weapons in the entire game. Just felt fucking epic wielding it, and that quest is still one of my favorites...ever.
---
ICC itself was amazing, putress is still one of my favorite bosses. Healer boss was also very interesting! I played ret but healed on that one. Loved it.
---
And the Lich King fight.....Still remember the excitement of killing him for the first time after wiping on it so many times. Screamed like a girl on vent. That cinematic is burned in my brain.
---
Vanilla might have hooked me to this game like nothing else, but WoTLK gave me some of my best memories.
---
I'm jealous of being able to play again for the first tim, I miss that real fresh wonder of exploring and doing the dungeons for the first time. I just hope that classic will help recreate even a fraction of those feelings again.
---
I find the people who say it is only nostalgia are also the ones who have never played on a private vanilla server since retail
---
It's your big brotherly duty to make him a heal bitch 
---
Go Gnome or go home. Personally I think that Escape Artist is better than Stoneform for Rogues
---
No Im not projecting anything.  
---
Self insertfuggs are the worst. Its always the worst kind that puts others down.  
---
&gt;It‚Äôs the people that play as girl characters that get self conscious when the self inserters assume they‚Äôre also self inserting  
---
Don't conflict others with your self inserting fugotry  
---
not everyone is a loser that do that  
---
I wondered all those questions myself, then the truth appeared when I accidentally knocked my head against the toilets : I will roll multiple rogues! HAHAHA! 
---
I liked the horde priest warlords regalia (lock and mage as well, but it's what my priest transmogs to when I'm subbed to live) and the rogue t2.5 (also what my UD rogue transmogs to on live). 
---
Hell, the super serious players will be 60 within 2 weeks probably.
---
Could have been; I haven‚Äôt played any private servers pat level 10 or so. I had a paladin 60 and a tour 60 during vanilla. There was a judgement and different seals. Can‚Äôt remember how it all worked. 
---
Man I love this theorycrafting with you but are you sure you aren't meant to be Shaman with your friend's Warrior? So unstoppable!
---
I actually like fishing 
---
But someone told me Patchwerk has 50 different armor so it's a cOmPlEtLeY dIfFeReNt GaMe!
---
Caverns of Time with dungeons or other redesigned events from WoW's future would be a fun twist. 
---
Not disagreeing with that. Loyalty 
---
Honestly probably the most accurate one I've seen yet. Assuming you're playing casually it's safe to assume it will take somewhere between 10-12 days /played. Assuming 4 hours per day more or less (with the occasional long 8 hour day and the occasional skip day) 2-3 months is about how long it takes me from personal experience. good job.
---
How is raid logging anything to brag about?
---
Locked for being irrelevant. Not removed to keep the top comment intact concerning Vanilla Friends.
---
World PvP is not just griefing lowbies... the fact you assume its just that is kinda sad.
---
I mean i reckon Classic will be (a lot) harder to get gold in, just like it was before in Vanilla. In retail it is a lot easier to get gold these days if you put in a little effort. 
---
You're not wrong in the numbers, but I guarantee most of it is nostalgia, including myself. Having not played Vanilla on private servers, so it had been a LONG time since I played it (the original blizzard servers), it was a huge shock to the \[my\] system playing it again. So slow, so boring, so.... vanilla. Not even having the option for auto loot... Ugh.
---
With that said, it was... Different, in a fun way. Having to actually read quests and look (or just, remember) where they were was great. Having to grind 40 Zehvras, Raptors, and Plain Striders... I can pass on that part. I can also pass on being a level 8-9 Hunter trying to solo Echo Isles quests. That shit is near impossible, those Voodoo trolls heal their entire HP and you can't kill them fast enough before they heal back. You actually go OOM kiting them as they heal up, or die due to dead zone. 
---
The upside to that? Forced grouping. Can't deny that's a huge pro for classic, something I've missed.
---
There will be plenty of brand new players to Classic, who never played back in Vanilla or on any private server. Some of them will realize that Classic is the best version (for them). Others will go back to BFA and continue their mount farming and pet battles.
---
Hello David, this seems to be a really important topic as the server you choose is a big deal. I may have good news for you if I understood the context right.
---
So playing on a RP Server does not necessarily means to be into roleplaying. I am playing on RP Servers for years because I also dont like the hardcore, rush to endgame/best gear mindset.
---
RP servers tend to have a majority of players wich in most cases means those players have a pretty busy life and like to play the game as a hobby to relax after a stressful day.
---
So since you're german? I'd like to give you some info about our upcoming guild.
---
Little bit of german following: Wir sind eine familienfreundliche Feierabendgilde, die nach bestem Wissen und mit den verf√ºgbaren Mitteln das Spiel vollumf√§nglich genie√üen will. Unser Ziel ist es eine herausragende Gildenatmosph√§re zu schaffen, in der die Community im absoluten Mittelpunkt steht. Gegenseitige Hilfe und Unterst√ºtzung soll der Grund zum Spielen und an der Freude sein.
---
Unsere Gilde ist bereits stark in Entwicklung. W√ºrde mich freuen von dir zu h√∂ren, wir werden n√§mlich auf jeden Fall auf einem RP-PvP Server spielen.
---
Viele Gr√º√üe
---
Same bro, must have run school 50 times saw my elements helm drop once and lost the roll. 
---
It always comes back to mind control man. So hard to give up. Well and benediction, levitate, Renew, pws.  
---
I am a priest at heart. I don't know how much time I will have for Alts and I do not want to risk NOT playing a priest lol. We'll see tho
---
Then it‚Äôs a stalemate because the rogues wouldn‚Äôt be stupid enough to get close. Hope those mages have a ton of bag space for food. We can do this all day. Rogues were OP in vanilla pre diminishing returns. Without an objective such as a BG rogues would win with their killing power. 
---
That may be true for you but it won't be for a lot of others. I had the exact opposite experience as you - I finally tried a private server a month ago and I was shocked at how much fun I had. It was actually more fun than I remembered, and that's saying a lot.
---
You don't need 2 spriests for VE healing, you don't even need 1. You have 8 resto shamans. You're going to have more aoe/incidental healing than you'll know what to do with. In fact you'd have more than enough with 4 resto shamans and VE still wouldn't be worth the debuff slot.
---
We have gotten to a point where people want immediacy with whatever it is. I cannot wait to go back to having to really work towards something and that is classic wow. Ironman in osrs helped me with that as well. I'm excited. 
---
I think we had 8-10 healers to begin. As we got better could go down one or two. 20 mans usually had 5 or 6. Varies alot because some fights don't need as many so some hybrid types didnt always heal but would if needed. I think MC ideally would have like 3 resto druids, 4 priests, 3 shammy/pally. 
---
Elemenral shaman is insane in pvp
---
No way.
---
Though if we do end up with an OSRS type voting system...then we'll certainly see it eventually.
---
I played a dwarf rogue in vanilla.  Stoneform was really useful.  Being a dwarf was cool too because people knew me as the dwarf rogue.  Most rogues on my server were night elves.  One of my favorite things to do was get naked, sap people, and make them watch me dance.  I will probably roll a dwarf or gnome rogue in classic too.  Just get some hit gear, and you will be fine without the human weapon racials.
---
I legitimately think Classic might fail because it's in current Blizzard's hands. I love Vanilla. I was invited to the alpha and played all the way through to Naxxramas. I probably played every single day Vanilla was live on servers... and then even moved to a variety of private servers years later. I still played retail WoW (until BFA), Overwatch, and other games Blizzard released on the way. They probably will fuck it up based on their recent track record.
---
I'm worried that them porting Vanilla content into the modern WoW architecture is going to be a catastrophic failure because of how their game handles large amounts of players. Retail WoW starts lagging server-wide the moment you get more than 40 people in the same area which is concerning for not only raiding, but world bosses and world content. They compensate on live servers by phasing which makes me think that phasing will be a permanent "solution" to the problem and that I won't see 75%+ of the players on my server because they'll be on another phase. This effects the server economy, gear availability, and world PvP. Can't wait until there's 10 phases of Kazzak/Azuregos/Dragons. Can't wait until people are phase hopping to farm items/materials/reagents. Can't wait until social constructs like the Devilsaur Mafia are invalidated.
---
Blizzard is also integrating their current [Battle.Net](https://Battle.Net) features into Classic including the report/ticket functionality. Back in the day, GMs would tell you to ignore someone instead of banning them except in the most extreme situations.  Getting camped? You're advised to take a break, hearth, fight back, call friends, etc. Modern Blizzard is so wrapped up in combating "toxicity" that they've implemented automated banning systems which knock you offline when multiple people report you. Just wait until another guild/raid competing for a raid boss mass reports your tanks and knocks them offline so that they can steal the boss. Just wait until you're banned for camping Nessingwary's because a bunch of low levels reported you and the automated system hits you with a 72-hour ban. Just wait until you're chat banned for advertising Scholo/Strath/UBRS groups in Trade because a few people right clicked report for spam.
---
**I was excited for Classic, but I no longer trust Blizzard to do it right. I'm anticipating one of the big private server communities being revived 6 months after Classic comes out because Blizzard ends up fucking the whole thing up somehow.**
---
I resubbed to live to scratch the itch, and after 2 months of play i'm bored of it. Felt burnt out with catch up for flying in certain zones. I'm now on a private server and having a blast. Bring on summer!
---
&gt;I suggested the Chef wasn't making perfect steaks anymore and instead was trying to pass off frozen burritos.
---
First all, thats all I was trying to say and prove in my early remark. I'm perfectly fine with people critiquing the Chef, but a lot of people think the piano lessons means the Chef isnt making entree meals anymore, and thats just silly. So I want to make sure we're clear on what I was trying to say on my first reply. 
---
Secondly, I don't think thats true. The Chef's last big dish that came out in 2016 was very highly acclaimed. I'm holding judgement until their next big dish, which they havent announced yet. 
---
&gt;Correct, he is still making new dishes but they all suck.
---
That's something we'll have to criticize the Chef for, I don't think it has anything to do with the piano lessons. Arguably, we could look at the fact the Chef might be working on too many dishes at the same time. 
---
&gt;The other chefs were already making frozen burritos in the first place, you couldn't tell the difference.
---
I don't think thats true either. This Chef isn't the only Chef on the planet that made great steaks before. There are plenty of chefs putting out great steaks. 
---
Btw all human models from caverns of time existed even in wow alpha. 
---
The game system and progressions and balance is also what kept vanilla, vanilla. 
---
Adding a tier has lots of consequences for PVP as well, which is already kinda silly when you get into t3 gear.
---
I'll be a new blood as well. I started in WoD when Legion was out, so it will be nice for me to finally get to experience Classic.
---
&gt;You're not wrong in the numbers, but I guarantee most of it is nostalgia
---
Okay speak for yourself. Ive played on private servers plenty and still love the game exactly as it was.
---
Sure bud 
---
It wasn‚Äôt great, it was the start of the end. 
---
What are you saying? 
---
I didn't think about multi boxers. I still think it's a long shot. You have to have the gold in retail to trade in Classic. There is a lot of work involved. I'm sure some people might do it but I doubt it will ever become a big thing. I hope not anyways.
---
Yeah... a day. Now you gotta do it again every day. I play WoW to do end game content and have fun... not run a gold trading business.
---
What was hard about leveling? 
---
leveling certainly was time consuming, but i think it's unfair to say it was ONLY that and not difficult, as there is very clearly an element of difficulty that is missing from today's game. i've played from cata all the way up to bfa, and i can't say that in any point in the leveling process did i have to worry about my health or mana, figure out which mob to pull so i don't pull a ton more, go oh shit because i'm clearly outnumbered, ect. you just pull giant packs of mobs and steamroll them down, there's zero chance of dying, things like bandages and cooking are pretty much useless outside of max level, the impact of getting a good piece of gear is lost because you feel godlike no matter what, any elite that's not a skull level is soloable, ect. like you can say it's a pretty low bar to set, but i think ''sometimes the things you kill have a chance of killing you'' should be a given tbh
---
Incredible. 
---
It's probably cheap because some pservers have cash shops where you can buy gold. I don't see it becoming a huge thing in classic. I hope not anyways. Also, that price was for your specific server. In Classic they may raise the prices. I expect it to be pretty expensive to start because no one will have gold. Rest assured the gold farmers will be out grinding gold to sell as soon as it launches. If people want to get gold without working for it then they can do that. I love what classic is. I like working for what I have. 
---
Vco - it was heavy horde side by quite a lot.   We had to constantly help clear zones for our leveling members.
---
I love PVP, but also want to be useful for raids.
---
Mage.
---
warrior t2 was the fav that I had. but warrior t3 is sick looking. All the naxx stuff is awesome looking.
---
here‚Äôs the thing, i don‚Äôt think classic would fail for lack of fun or things to, and i also don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs only fun because of nostalgia, as i play on vanilla private servers. if it fails, it‚Äôs because it is in the ‚Äúwrong hands.‚Äù yes blizzard is the mastermind genius behind the game but that was then, and this is now, and activision blizzard has had the worst record lately when it comes to the delivery, or the execution of their product. they don‚Äôt know what their fans want to play anymore because they obviously have a very strict, set-in-stone agenda that is based off of making the most profit. i am hopeful but i would not be surprised if there were many things that show up in the final product that people begged not to happen. they don‚Äôt have to tell us anything they‚Äôre planning to do and obviously if they told us every detail, a lot of people would jump ship before it even sets sail. we will have to wait and see, is all that we can do(:
---
Khazad Zanvarad - Vco
---
Although I did eventually join CB on ED after the population on Vco was dead dead
---
Vco is for fite !
---
That was my home as well
---
Seems like you take serious issue with the slower pacing of the game, which clearly suggests youre in no position to guarentee anything about what is or isnt nostalgia.
---
Probably the single biggest draw of Vanilla is that its not just a poorly disguised instant gratification simulator.
---
Yep
---
I actually don't understand the 'it's just nostalgia' argument at all tbh. I want to clarify that it's *not*, but even *if* it was, what would be wrong with playing it to relive that nostalgia? There's PS2 and Gamecube games that are inferior to the current generation of games, the issue is WoW has changed so much that it's practically another game at this point, players can't go back and play it as they can with other games, hence the need for Classic servers.
---
Honestly, the only thing that retail has over WoW is the art/graphics. My genuine hope for Classic is that it succeeds to the point that major design decisions would be redone with retail. That said, I'm totally abandoning everything when Classic comes out and will be devoting all my free time to it.
---
Retail will NEVER retain what Classic had. LFR will never go away, neither will flying, etc. But my hope is that SOMETHING changes in retail, be it a return to a classic talent tree system and better endgame content.
---
I also hope other mmo games take note of Classics certain pending success.
---
i think a part of it definitely was because wod was so bad, but legion also introduced a lot of cool things that people were genuinely excited for - class halls, artifact weapons and the artifact trees, world quests, the concept of level-scaling zones and the ability to quest where you want, the return of characters like illidan, khadgar, alleria and turalyon, ect... i'm not really sure if some of that will turn out to be bad for the game in the long run, but at the time it definitely felt new, refreshing and enjoyable

I actually remember spying being done quite often with larger guilds having just one person/friend spying for them and giving details over Vent. Albeit it was often the hardcore PvP guilds/servers and the rivalries they had with other guilds..
---
Shit was amazing. Especially once people found the spyand HE was camped kek
---
Your only valid concern is the lag at 40+ ppl in the same area. But that could be due to retail spells and ai. Different game. All your other concerns are hyperbolic and sensationalist and simply wont happen 
---
You have my full dwarven support. The ironforge spirit is strong.
---
Judging by your flair I assume you're going to be horde. If not u can do the SM dungeon chain quest for a good 2hander. [Bonebiter](https://classicdb.ch/?item=6830)
---
You know what, I rolled both a dwarf and a gnome on a private server to see how they look like. 
---
My favourite beard choice on the gnome leaves weird hair lines on the face when wearing a rogue mask. They look like hairy scars. WTF
---
god hyjal sucks so bad please no
---
And everyone sneakily trying to find a replacement with a key for someone not in their role. Then another group comes opens the door and everyone has to run the instance pretending like they weren't just trying to replace each other
---
Varies depending on difficulty of the content and how tryhard your raid is. In Naxx progression around 14 healers should be brought.
---
It's just a nonsensical argument to begin with: "hur durr warcraft 3 was only good because you were younger" kind of bullshit
---
I'm making a casual guild for people just like us!  No attendance or performance requirements, we just try to get on when we can and do what we can.
---
When I left during Cataclysm I played Rift: Planes of Telara for a couple of years.  Bard was an amazing class to play, it channeled music to build combo points and bashed out riffs to expend them for crowd control, group buffs, heals, etc. Mechanically it felt like a cross between Shadowpriest (channelling) Rogue (Combo finishers) and Shaman (totem/motif) twisting.  It was a true hybrid/mezz build that did a little bit of everything and really enhanced a group composition.  WHen Blizzard was cutting the guts out of what made their game good, Trion was doubling down on it and taking it to a new level. 
---
EVERYONE should speak for themselves
---
It's cute how clueless people are about Vanilla then slap a raid composition like this up, haha.
---
Shadow Priest will find their way into raids for some reason, but aren't vital whatsoever in a raid. In fact they should have no place at all in a raid. Go Mage. Far greater use in PvE as well as PvE, where as Shadow Priest you SHOULD be replaced by a Holy Priest that can do your job + a more optimal DPS.
---
I never put anybody down, buddy. I never shamed anybody. You‚Äôre so defensive you can‚Äôt even logically understand my point of view. 
---
You are projecting. Telling me I‚Äôm putting others down while trying to put me down. 
---
But I do think you‚Äôre full of shame. It‚Äôs probably really hard for you to accept. It‚Äôs ok. Even if you‚Äôre trans. 
---
Prostitute 
---
Life for you must be fucking awful if all you do is worry so much about things that are totally out of your control.
---
&gt; Nobody needs their validation, the subscriber numbers throughout the lifetime of wow speaks for itself.
---
That‚Äôs not just down to retail being trash. MMO just aren‚Äôt as popular these days. I do think Vanilla will get a good following even more than retail. I don‚Äôt think we will see 10mil+ players on Vanilla.
---
Just look at what Runescape, another classic "childhood" mmo did. They released 'old school' servers for their game several years ago and it has thousands more active players daily than their 'normal' servers. It's not always nostalgia that drives these things and Runescape is a great example. Their oldschool servers offer a simpler easier to learn game than their current ones.
---
True
---
You do need the 8 warriors tho
---
Says the guy with 2 shadow priest and 5 warlocks in his raid comp
---
So like 6-7 priests, 4-5 pally/shaman, 3 druid is roughly appropriate?
---
You don't need 3 hunters for tranq...
---
Mages are OP in 1.12. This means they will be OP forever in Classic. 
---
FROST MAGE ALL DAY
---
Yup, i don't know if it was like that in every guild but my guild (80+ players) on Nostalrius had around 50% of members that never raided in vanilla WoW before so i expect there will be even more new players on official servers.
---
I don't share your concern, a new 40 man raid should always bring a new tier, period. Classic is a so good game that it simply deserves more horizontal stuff in it, including tiers, even with the risk of trivialising gear from later expansions, in this case TBC.
---
The way I see it, there are only 2 ways of continuing WoW Classic after Naxxramas. Either move to TBC, or start to treat Classic like a stand-alone game and continue to update it with horizontal content.
---
Well, if the next expansion is just as bad as BfA I'll gladly stay with Classic, even after 2 years.
---
I'm more of a Knights of the Dinner Table kind of guy
---
I've noticed a weird trend on this sub during the last few weeks, there's a group of people who consider basically everything as hate on BfA, even when it's not.
---
This may or may not happen, it's a matter of probability. Being pessimistic does nothing for you.
---
I don't event want to remember this stupid cutscene. I love WoW, but goddamn, what they did with the characters from Warcraft is unforgivable. 
---
Wotlk maybe had it's issues, but it's still the best expansion for me by far.
---
All of those examples happen in retail WoW right now. 
---
1.) You can force new phases by clustering large amounts of players in the same area in order to spawn old world bosses, herb/mining nodes, etc and then invite your friends from the other phase.
---
2.) You can currently mass report enemy players in RBGs and they are knocked offline and banned until a GM reviews the reports. Example from well known PvP community member/streamer: [https://twitter.com/SavixIrL/status/1090420219619602434](https://twitter.com/SavixIrL/status/1090420219619602434)
---
3.) You can mass report competing M+/raid selling guilds in trade chat to have them muted. The video example I was going to link of this is no longer available in this thread [https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/an0dxc/blizzard\_has\_dropped\_the\_ball\_on\_the\_new\_report/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/an0dxc/blizzard_has_dropped_the_ball_on_the_new_report/). It was a recording of a person typing in their own guild chat and had 5 guild members report their message which resulted in them being instantly banned and muted. 
---
It's not sensationalist, these are legitimate issues with Blizzard's current WoW client and B.Net.
---
It's not really pessimism. This is how the current WoW client functions and these systems were enabled on the Classic BlizzCon demo.
---
While you might be correct to some degree Blizzards anti botting has gotten pretty good.
---
I decided to test it during the end of WoD with a trial account in the troll starting area. I watched the bot play for one hour and it got a 6 month temp ban for botting. 
---
I'd say it was much easier to die while leveling than in later expansions like Cata.  Accidentally pull another mob or god forbid two mobs and you're done for.    It was also harder in the sense that questing was much less streamlined and you'd end up with a lot of dead ends where you just had to grind for a little while unless you wanted to take a long trip to get to a new zone.  Not saying that leveling was legitimately hard, but harder yes.
---
I saw someone make an excellent point about classic having attainable goals with gear that holds value vs retail being the never ending grind for slightly higher iLevels. Earning loot in vanilla wow is truly satisfying compared to retail. I‚Äôve tried retail for like a month every expac just for the hope it could be better, and never had a reason to care about any of my character‚Äôs gear save for that artifact weapon (but it was absolutely stupid launch day on Legion seeing hundreds of other players next to me doing their artifact being hailed like the 1 true savior of Azeroth or some BS, literally lol‚Äôd)
---
To that point retail trying to force the ‚Äúyou alone are our greatest hero‚Äù idea vs the original trilogy with you being a relative nobody who needs to team up allies to overcome stuff. Vanilla wow handled it way better. 
---
nice, I just realized that the Stoneslayer and The Rockpounder drop from the same boss and according to wowwiki, you have a 20-25% chance to get one of them. though he's an endboss, so I'm wondering, do you know by any chance how hard is it to farm him, with a help of a level 60? I'm guessing you need to kill just about everything in uldaman, which doesn't sound fast.
---
polearms do have a spec btw, though in a really shitty place, almost at the bottom of the arms tree... the only reason I wouldn't be worried about using a polearm is Ice Barbed Spear, since you can get that at level 51 and it's the best leveling weapon.
---
Pretty much, yeah.  
---
this is also my only concern; vanilla as in the old product we know and the few private servers that try to emulate it to their best ability is a great game.
---
vanilla in current blizzard's hands? we literally dont know how it'll be. i'm still hoping it'll be good but i'm not expecting it to be.
---
Imagine being so much of a fan boy that you can't accept when someone has legitimate criticisms of a company's vision. Yikes dude.
---
I think it will. I started playing on a private server and whilst a lot of it was nostalgia there are a few things here and there that I either never experienced or dont remember that give me a spark of "whoa!" And I get that feeling back
---
No one mentioned Holy Nova.  Which is pretty important if you plan to do much Arathi Basin flag defense.
---
I see this argument a lot, and it depends on if one of the players actually plays and cares about retail. Not everyone in classic cares about retail, and judging by bfa‚Äôs performance not even ActiBlizzard or their community gives a shit about the state of retail.  The point is, you‚Äôre not always going to be able to make this exchange, because after a few months when players drop off and classic holds a steady pop, the people who are playing classic regularly probably don‚Äôt care about retail or play it.
---
What‚Äôs classicast 
---
It is a deal breaker.
---
As you said, in the event that Blizzard do indeed fuck up Classic one way or another, we will simply move back to private servers doing a better job at restoring that vanilla experience.
---
Players have nothing to lose from this, except for maybe a couple months of subscription. Private servers have always been around and will always be around. Blizzard has a lot to lose after stirring up all that vanilla hype, if they don't deliver they'll only be promoting private servers even more.
---
I don't really recall much about uldaman honestly.   
---
And I had totally forgotten about polearm spec. HA. 
---
Brilliant, I‚Äôd rather do that anyway as after the expansions it must be so overwhelming in terms of content. Only thing I‚Äôd be disappointed about is not being able to play as a panda haha
---
Someone who knows when to CC a target, and retreat, and assist securing a kill rather than trying to be a in a Rogue 3v1 kill montage every fucking opportunity -- which just means you will die 9/10 and cause grief to your team in BG's.
---
A rogue in large pvp has to be an opportunist to prevent healers in the back from healing, and to turn the tables in a small skirmish to make sure players on your faction stay alive.
---
Fair enough then, maybe it will be like that. I hope it is, genuinely. It might bring live back to it's core for groups/community focused content if Blizzard picks up on that.
---
I really want it to turn out alright too, but the system flaws are so massive right now. Worst case scenario, I'm sure we'll run past each other on Nost 2 :)
---
Slower pacing in terms of class gameplay for sure, not the speed of levelling and such though. Grinding is grinding, there's nothing good about that regardless of pace.
---
By that logic, Ocarina of time, mario 64, goldeneye, perfect dark, mario cart, mario party, and literally and other platinum title on the N64 is also dog shit.
---
These people are idiots who are clinging to retail and don't want their dying game to die out.
---
Its a combination of the sunk cost fallacy and the reason why your good friend stays with her trashy abusive boyfriend because she wants to feel like she never made a mistake in the first place.
---
A big factor of why I'm rolling rogue is due to their awesome looking T2 set... Bloodfang all the way!
---
Question regarding Black Dragonscale Armour for hunters (crafted LW): I never see this mentioned anywhere on pre raid BIS items. Are they competitive or worth obtaining at all? I ask mainly because I think the set looks really cool and it'd be something that can be soloed towards obtaining rather than trying to get into dungeon groups as a lesser desired class and rolling on rogue items.
---
EA is super undervalued since its on a 1 min cd + being a tiny gnome means you'll be harder to target, both are great race choices though, i'd say gnome is better for bgs, dwarf for wpvp
---
Good weapons.
---
Plenty of people are going to play it, especially right around launch. Many will enjoy it for a while for the nostalgia trip but will eventually leave for whatever reason. There will be plenty of people remaining who will continue to play for a long time. Whatever that number is will be enough to keep the game going.
---
There will always be enough of a player base for healthy server populations. I have no doubt about that. However, if the number of subscribers drops drastically, I imagine they would offer transfers and eventually do merges. I‚Äôd rather they not but if they continued to operate at least a handful of each server type; people would still be able to choose between playing on the few high pop servers or play on a lower pop server.
---
I‚Äôm interested to see where this goes. See you all in game!
---
I think paladin has to spec consecrate, besides that one aoe that only hits undead.
---
&gt;Human has the edge in PvE because of sword spec, but all 3 do just fine. The racial amounts to having around 1% hit.
---
Using stats from my tanking spreadsheet, so it's not taking the DW hit penalty into account, but for a sword and board tank, here's what the impact of weapon skill looks like:
---
300 weapon skill vs level 63 mob (bosses)
---
9% chance to miss, 5.6% chance to be blocked, dodged or parried. 30% damage reduction from glancing blows.  Glancing blows account for 40% of all white hits.  Can't speak to rogues, but for a tank, that's a sizeable portion of your damage.  In fact, threat generated from white hits worked out to about \*half\* of the threat I generated, although that obviously varies depending on what weapon and shield you're using.
---
305 weapon skill vs level 63 mob
---
6% chance to miss, 5.4% to be blocked, dodged or parried.  So 3.6% for tanks (less for DPS as they don't get blocked or parried if they're positioned properly).  Also the damage reduction from glancing blows goes from 30% down to 15% (3% per weapon skill at a linear rate until 310 WS).  Like I said, for a tank, white hits are important, so 15% of 40% glancing is 6% more white hit damage, or 3% more total threat generated on top of 3.6% extra hit.  Hitting 305 weapon skill is a very sizable increase to damage.
---
There's a reason that items with WS like Mugger's Belt and Edgemaster's Handguards are so coveted, and that is because weapon skill is insane.  Now, after 305, it loses value (it's still good to have more, but in terms of stat weight, it's value drops significantly due to the change in the formula for calculating hits).  So from 305 to 310, for example, you reduce misses from 6% to 5.5% and dodges from 5.4% to 5.2%, for a total of .7% more hit and another 15% knocked off the DR from glancing (from 15% down to 0%.  You still glance 40% of your white hits, but there's no damage reduction, it just means those attacks can't crit because they're glances).  AFAIK, there isn't an item that rogues can use that increases WS for swords (Mugger's Belt and Death's Sting are for daggers, Expert Goldminer's Helmet is for Axes, Edgemaster's Handguards are mail-type and can't be worn), so there's never a point where your gear would negate the desire for racial WS.
---
I had to shake my head at the reply lower down in this thread where someone says that top players aren't going to min-max racials for raids because it's a "noobtrap".  Top players are going to be competing for fastest clear times and will want every advantage they can have for that.  If you're willing to flask for MC every week in order to improve clear times, you're willing to roll a human.
---
what a completely hilariously inefficient way to get to your portal destination. I love it!
---
that's not bad, though having a 60 friend also makes [Ravager](https://classicdb.ch/?item=7717) piss easy to get, which afaik is better for leveling.
---
Dwarves are ugly. Roll human for that alone.
---
In your opinions, do you think instanced farming will be nerfed, and if so how long will to take them to nerf it?
---
You doubt people's ability and willingness to pretend to have played before everyone else!
---
Well it was less than 10 level difference. We were roughly 42. I wouldn't say we were higher than 44 though. We kited her for a long time... 
---
Because Kara was originally designed to be in Vanilla and they cut it
---
Yeah that's about right for a good balance of having all the buffs and loot distribution. Probably should only roll 2 druids and kick paladins down to 3-4. Shaman you ideally want 8 because the utility from totems is crazy, so horde would be like 8 shaman, 4 priest, 2 druid.
---
It‚Äôs still Sunday here
---
What weapon types are human warriors able to equip from the start(without needing to visit the weapon master)? Sword and mace? Probably not axe but how about bow/gun/thrown?
---
If that isn't what you wanted to do, you wouldn't need it, because duels, BGs, and arenas let you engage in plenty of fair PvP.
---
They are good items but do not compete with the other options.  1% hit and 2% crit for 3 pieces when devilsaur gives 2% hit / 2% crit in 2 pieces.  For shoulders the truestrike attack power / 2% hit are amazing and with the 2% crit mail chest they simply outclass black dragonscale.  However private servers do not stack resist in mc and it's not known whether the formulas are incorrect or if resist wasn't really needed after all given all the fire protection potions instead.
---
+1
---
While leveling they melee most mobs cycling range shot melee if played correctly.  At 60 melee is typically used to raptor strike wing clip together.
---
2016 was the frozen pizza, an upgrade to the burnt microwave burrito that was WoD. Legion was the best expansion since wotlk hands down, but still not as good as TBC or WOTLK. Cataclysm and MOP were burnt steaks. They were steaks still, just not as good as the first three. Coincidentally hearthstone (available on mobile) development started in 2008 the same year they released wotlk (remember how shitty ToC was?).
---
No company has ever made a game that touched blizzards original quality. WoW was (is still amazingly) far ahead of it's competition, people STILL play d2 19 years later. The point is, people expect more from Blizzard and garbage like CoD XLV and MADDEN 2055 is what we expect from their competition.
---
I like analogies because they allow you to express things without getting too bogged down in semantics and make it easy to express ideas, but at the same time they are imperfect.
---
Blizzard has had declining quality for years and while there are many things to point towards some of the most obvious are spreading it's top talent around too many IP's (and running them off) and spreading into mobile is really just the straw that broke the camels back as they say. 
---
'goldeneye'
---
/i triggered i/
---
Warcraft 2 was a good game
---
Grenades, Frost reflector, Rocket helm and free action potions count mage pretty well.  You also have scatter shot to gain some distance.  Yes mages make it hard but you eat them alive if you notice them at the start or can get back to range.
---
People still play Super Mario Bros 3, they still play A Link to the Past.  I break those games out about once a year, myself.  I imagine I'll do that with WoW Classic for as long as it exists too.
---
I always maintain that courtesy when ganking. It's just a gentleman's code of honour. I might be a literal backstabbing rogue, but I'm not a monster.
---
I have nothing to say
---
300-400 DPS 
---
But whining about it the way you are isn't going to change the outcome of the game. All it does is bring everyone down when we just want to be excited for release. I mean jesus just wait until you actually have something to complain about. You're crying over milk that's still in the glass.
---
Grinding is good.
---
Anything on OwnedCore is gonna get your account in trouble if caught.         
---
You'll either get rolled back or straight up banned.       
---
So your first point IS sensationalist, but the other two are valid concerns.          
---
Since it's unlikely that they'll get rid of the reporting system, a way harsher punishment for false reports could help and restricting trial accounts as much as is needed could be good.
---

---
Watch this dude and you will see what a great rogue is capable of.
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter if they play retail they can still use the retail gold to buy WoW tokens and use that as game time.
---
Question is if they want to trade their WoW gold for game time. 
---
That's not classic at all lol I'd quit immediately 
---
One feral druid wont hurt anyone. There‚Äôs also one MAJOR thing a lot of people aren‚Äôt taking into account. If you take too many of one class or even too many people that need the same gear, half of your raid will be gimped come next tier. I dont know where people are getting the idea that gear is always useful when it drops (pally gear for horde/shaman gear for ally) or that the right pieces will drop for your raid to continue gearing. Some times rng just doesn‚Äôt cooperate like that.  If you have 18-20 warriors/rogues, where the hell are they going to get that man sets of weapons?  
---
Fair enough. At the end of the day both are good so pick what you like
---
I think that logic can *sometimes* be valid. In the case of Goldeneye, it's so hard to go back to using one joystick for movement, and needing to stop / hold R to aim up or down. I feel like modern shooters are a straight upgrade, as that mechanic didn't add anything to the game. The main point of shooter games is shooting, and modern shooters are more fun to shoot in... if that makes sense.
---
But the main point of MMOs is the Online part, AKA interacting with other players. The changes made to WoW since release have made that less meaningful, definitely not a straight upgrade.
---
Every minute of vanilla feels like an adventure of me. Ironically 5 hours of 110-120 feels like a huge chore compared to the 200 hours from 1-60. Id say the rate of exp and the level pacing is near flawless in Vanilla.
---
selling and farming is not the same  
---
if you're from the first world country its not worth your time to farm gold unless you're doing some multiple account script botting stuff or pshing people  
---
1v1 is about calculating your DR and being ready to counter every possible ability after (if) stuns wear off using cooldowns/engineering/potions/trinkets/off-hand, but also being ready to counter the counter to that ;). Unexpected counters like terrain usage and clever stealth reset are what makes a great rogue - watch some pvp videos to get some ideas.
---
In group PvP you aren't as strong so your main role is CC - especially on healers and classes that can control the fight.
---
PvE is about knowing the fights inside and out so you can time your abilities and potions/trinkets to the speed the raid is going. Also SS and evisc after a MH swing (especially horde) - most people still don't know this...
---
Yup enjoying retail Vanilla and Vanilla private servers must be due to nostalgia.
---
It can never because Vanilla was just great the way it was.
---
And from we've seen so far, sharding loot trading and right click report are all absolutely terrible systems that should never make it to Classic. I absolutely cannot wait for the all the retail kids spamming "you need?" when I obtain a piece of gear because of loot trading.
---
Blizzard has only 1 chance to do this right or else Vanilla private servers will be more popular than ever.
---
I agree, that's why I said a remade Hyjal raid ... as in, remake it so it's fun this time
---
it spreads viable awarness for the concern that could help blizzard make good changes. 
---
I literally logged into a private server with the 'it must be nostalgia' mindset after being disappointed by retail for a long time.
---
That was 5 years ago and I've hardly taken a break because I love this version of the game. Guess those guys who say that just haven't tried it :)
---
Blizzard knows our concerns. They will either care, or they will not care. Expressing them on this subreddit over and over will not actually make them care any more or less. These people are just the annoying 'keyboard activists' of the gaming world.
---
That's a funny way to spell Broxigar
---
Dude, only losers played like that. All pros played with the yellow buttons as wasd and aiming with the stick. 
---
The point of shaman is that it's a utility class.  The sum of the parts is greater than each person individually.  Yes, enchancement shaman in vanilla didn't do "gud dps".  The point was that they were there to buff the others,  and to be perfectly honest.  It's about having fun.  As long as your class is boosting the 4 other people in your group.  It makes up for the shaman going enhancement.  
---
Not to mention but it's about having fun.  Unless you're in a super hard-core min-max guild that requires everyone to have alchemy alts and everyone have enchanting/engineering as their two raiding professions so your guild can be server first Naxx clear, then yea.  They probably won't take an enhancement shaman.
---
The amount of people looking for that type of guild, not to mention the actual # of guilds that will \*actually\* close on their goal of being "super hardcore" are few and far between
---
I'm pretty biased towards Dwarves across the board due to the lore and Stoneform is pretty fantastic.
---
Easily the best rogue for inner-city assassinations when you absolutely need to be invisible **right now**.
---
&gt; find treasure racial is the hidden gem 
---
Really? How is that? 
---
I can understand that. It just felt the same as BFA does now. Cool for a month, then bleh. Class halls were nice, but I didn't care for the artifacts. They lose their charm when everyone has one. I mean, it's the god damn Ashbringer! Then you see 100 other pallies carrying it as well... Not to mention the AP grind was horrible. 
---
World quests are another thing I despise, they seem like busy work. Zone scaling is a a double edged sword for me. For low levels, it's cool that we could finally finish the quest chains in the different zones. But I felt that once you reached max level though,  having all the mobs also scale to 110 (or 120 as it is now) reduced the feeling of being a powerful figure. It's like, why are these mobs that I fought 10 levels ago still just as powerful as when I was level 100? As for Lore, I haven't cared since WOTLK lol.
---
Calling someone a fanboy for simply complaining that you're crying over pre-spilt milk is pretty much the Godwin's Law of gaming.    
---
Seriously, how thin skinned, and infantile do you have to be to just call any dissenting opinion "fanboy!"  Just because someone disagrees with you, even rudely or vehmently. Doesn't mean they are a fanboy.  All you did just now by calling him that was completely invalidate your opinion because it proves you don't actually have any logic in this: you're just thinking with emotions instead.
---
Engineering. 
---
There are lots of reasons that retail wow has so much lag when there are more than 40 people around, the biggest reasons are to do with the incredible amount of spells, abilities, addons and logging that happens in modern WoW, and the fact that the server architecture is designed around sharding these days, not having everyone in the same world. There is no way that the power of modern servers would struggle to run vanilla wow with 100 vs 100 battles. We already know that Classic won't be using the modern WoW server architecture since they've said they won't seriously be using sharding, the only part of modern WoW they're using is the client.
---
Imo it should be banned because:
---
a) PvP would be awful
---
b) Gold farmers ruining the economy
---
But this is Activision Blizzard so... more $$$ for them I guess
---
I respect you on a fundamental level
---
oh no, i totally agree! like i said, even if some things seemed fun at the time, they can still be damaging for the long term health of the game, i'm noticing that a lot of additions to wow have been like that haha
---
like you said the ap grind did suck and is only worse in bfa because now you can't even fully use gear without grinding that stuff out, it's. bad. and even if i did think stuff like the ashbringer was super cool at first and was totally prepared to level a pally for it, def think it was cooler and worked better as its own thing and not something everybody had. not to mention the ap systems just encourage blizzard to keep pruning bc they can take the rent-a-class system for the current expansion and go ''see? it's fixed''
---
as for zone scaling - can't agree more with all of those points, i really do miss that sense of progression. having the opportunity to choose where you quest and what order you go in is also really good if you just fucking hate a certain zone or something, but also means stories have to be much much more self contained because they can't, say, hint at something in one zone and have it fully revealed or elaborated on in future zones like they could in the past
---
I think you don't speak English and want multiboxers banned to prevent them from doing the Lord's work camping China farmers. Ni hao amigo, can't wait to camp and spam report you and your ilk in tyrs hand. 
---
Let's not forget Mythic+. I think that was the true genius of Legion. Lore, as you mentioned, was pretty cool, level scaling was great (especially as someone who likes story and leveling), but Mythic+ really was my absolute favorite thing about Legion. Honestly, I didn't like the gameplay of most the classes, but the Mythic+ and level scaling really kept me interested despite that. I think Blizzard has been criminally under-praised for that design (from what I've seen anyways, I don't scour the boards so maybe they've received due praise).
---
Warcraft two was one of my first PC games. Addiction is strong. 
---
&gt;And then LFG, which is a great tool for the older content that is impossible to find a group for, but as far as the current content is concerned, it really should never have been there.
---
That's a really good way to explain the problem with LFD. Current expansion should be old-school LFG Chat (maybe make it expansion wide i.e. if you were in a legion zone, you would see LFG chat. Or possible make it level restricted). Maybe they'll look into issues with LFD at some point, but I doubt it.
---
The same difference between most other PvP environments - reaction speed (how fast you can process information and react to it), real time decision making (how well you can process information and how consistently  you make the best decisions), awareness (how much information you can process simultaneously), and general knowledge of mechanics/the game itself (abuses, class abilities, items, counters, environment details etc).
---
totally! i'm not a big fan of timer based stuff/the feeling of needing to rush so i don't do them much, but i will say a big problem for me was feeling like dungeons were irrelevant after the first week or so of an expansion and i'm still glad that they found a solid way to fix it
---
&gt;they still weren't comparable to BC heroics,
---
Except Halls of Reflection. Week 1 before anyone learned the strats of hiding behind the walls, that shit was near impossible. That first room was absolutely insane, but it was so fucking fun. It was a bit easier with full non-LFD, but it was definitely hard. I don't remember BC heroics being that crazy except for maybe shattered halls and shadow labs.
---
hey, you're the guy that wrote that awesome and informative guide! very nice!
---
if you're ever planning on updating it, two things I'd like to add:
---
- since you shouldn't be going for mind flay anyway, 3/5 shadow focus isn't required, 2/5 should be plenty enough. you're only losing 1% hit chance against enemies 2 levels higher, but that shouldn't come up all that often.
---
- for rotation, I'm personally on the side of holy fire -&gt; SW:P -&gt; (mind blast -&gt;) wand, holy fire allows bigger frontload damage, and if there isn't all that much time between mobs, 3 sec cast time let's you have better regen. iirc there's little need for PW:S that way, maybe only a renew now and then.
---
otherwise, rock on, yours is one of the most well thought-out guides I've ever had the pleasure of reading.
---
Yeah. The way Classic took across the world for just one quest is easily one of my favorite aspects of the game. Remember this quest?
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=3844/its-a-secret-to-everybody#guides
---
Should multiboxing be banned? Yes.
---
Will it be banned? No.
---
Blizzard would rather profit from these cash cows, than do something which improves the game for everyone else.
---
classic wont fail, actiblizz will
---
I dont think classic will fail because it's just nostalgia. I fear classic will fail because Activision will ruin it
---
I've seen very few people saying classic will fail. It certainly isn't a popular opinion... so, I guess congratulations?
---
Many other games have already proven that there is an audience for a "classic" adventure. What remains to be seen is how the population remains long term with content stagnation. Might just be an actual churn of people with no realized die offs, might be the same core people who want to level and gear a ton of alts - we'll see!
---
Ye I'm not native English speaker, but i can understand that you just posted and totally disappointed with it. 
---
Btw why do you think that i will take a step to the Tyrs hand? 
---
Yeah I remember a lot of fun times from Halls of Reflection. The ICC Heroic has some great fights.
---
&gt; Introduce LFD for 1-60 or 1-70 content, because the older worlds are just too empty to form groups from 1 server.
---
I respectfully disagree. I levelled in BC and wotlk and you could still form groups. It wasn't instant but some of the people I ran with I formed genuine friendships with. I think taking that away for the sake of convenience is a mistake.
---
whoops, well TIL I was a scrub in the 90s
---
Back in Vanilla our raid dosent have rogues. i think this will come back with classic in the first time.
---
an example for great is the name you get from enemys.
---
example:
---
on the way from kargath to molten core there was one enemy ally warrior. he charged and people dying on the mount. he solo kills 3-4  of us and we hated it, this is great a masterpiece.
---
rogue is rogue even the good ones will not get great names or honor i think.
---
&gt;if you're from the first world country its not worth your time to farm gold unless you're doing some multiple account script botting stuff
---
That hunter/mage you see humping earth elementals in Badlands or Arathi isn't selling gold, they're just a poor kid trying to pay for 100 speed riding.  No one solo farms in wow to sell gold or at least not for long it is incredibly inefficient and disruptable.  It's always multibox instance grinding.
---
And lets not forget the wipes 
---
druid is all about kiting, keeping range, +6 yards on spells is absolute.  ur specing past natures reach anyway so of course u might as well pick it up
---
Even if you do a good job healing there will be a few dumbasses that yell at you.  People will stand in fires and aoe, break cc pull Agro. 
---
First of all, I think I win this debate because you broke the analogy!
---
In all seriousness, I was talking about Overwatch. In OP's talk he was referring to games as a whole, not just WoW expansions.
---
There is a giant circlejerk that think, that Blizzard isn't making AAA games anymore, and thats what i was trying to get at.
---
To me, Legion was better than Wrath, just because they explored way more ideas than Wrath did. 
---
&gt;No company has ever made a game that touched blizzards original quality. 
---
I think you're putting the studio on a pedestal here. There are tons of communities for old games. Thats nothing new. 
---
&gt;Coincidentally hearthstone (available on mobile) development started in 2008 the same year they released wotlk (remember how shitty ToC was?).
---
That's a giant stretch. If you're going to make that argument, I think a stronger one is how a bunch of core WoW developers went to work on Titan in 2007. And thats inevitable in game development, as the studio grows, and there arises the need to have a broad portfolio for the next thing.
---
If that didn't happen, we would have never have gotten WoW.
---
&gt;No company has ever made a game that touched blizzards original quality. WoW was (is still amazingly) far ahead of it's competition, people STILL play d2 19 years later. 
---
We're talking about 2 different studios here. Blizzard did not make D2, Blizzard North did. This is like, the Chef's 2nd restaurant that was operated by a different chef, and that restaurant closed down in 2005.
---
&gt;Blizzard has had declining quality for years and while there are many things to point towards some of the most obvious are spreading it's top talent around too many IP's (and running them off) 
---
 I don't think it is a decline of quality. WoW expansions fluctuate, thats for sure.  But Overwatch was fantastic, Starcraft II is/was great. 
---
&gt;spreading into mobile is really just the straw that broke the camels back as they say.
---
I don't see how that is when its an outsourced game. 
---
ofc
---
This is literally a thread about building an ideal raid composition, not which meme specs can make it into casual raiding
---
natures reach increases their range by 20%. i would also argue that improved roots is also worth getting, to ensure u can get distance
---
The thing about vanilla is that it was usually quite clear why the group wiped. There was no single role that people would always default to for blame. If the tank died and mobs were being properly CC'd, it was probably the healer's lack of performance. If a DPS pulled agro and died, we all saw it. If a tank pulled too many mobs, it was obvious.  
---
I think you'll be just fine as a healer in Classic. Healing was pretty straight forward for the most part. Find some dps friends who know the meaning of CC, and a tank friend who is dedicated to gearing as a tank, and you'll never have a problem in any 5 man dungeon.  
---
In instances while leveling up to 60, this is no problem for me. But in serious raids with ventrilo I dont want this to happen  :) 
---
uh no, u do it once every 30 days, thats how long a token gives u
---
Isn't classic just going to be included as part of retail subscription?
---
In what way, would it even be *possible* that it "fails" at that point?
---
&gt;No one solo farms in wow to sell gold or at least not for long it is incredibly inefficient and disruptable  
---
Chinese do. Or at least used to. I don't know how it is today.  
---
Blizzard has stood by multiboxers since vanilla that's not changing.
---
Thanks for a long answer. So long as i know the strat, have appropriate gear and learn my class I should be able to do it then
---
The ones in the most populated cities.  Thrall and Magni.
---
Play what you wanna play man. If you take the time to get good at a healer class you will get good at it. 
---
Healers get blamed often because DPS just have to button mash and stay out of the fire, and if they don‚Äôt realize they‚Äôre standing in the fire, it‚Äôs your fault they died because you ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt heal them enough‚Äù or some other BS. Chances are your group fucked it up and you were the scape goat. 
---
When classic comes around pick a class you like, watch/read some guides, and find some groups to heal as you level. You start with a pretty limited tool kit, and it expands gradually which makes it a lot easier to grasp. 
---
Also, retail can be pretty toxic. Actual vanilla was pretty chill, and private servers of vanilla are somewhere in the middle. Don‚Äôt get discouraged and pick something else because of a bad experience. 
---
Tranq works better with 3, back in vanilla i was tier 2 Hunter. we cleared all. is more relaxed with 3 Hunters and more fun, even for kiting. And some of us hunter always in the top 10 of dd.
---
same if one hunter cannot raid one day. it's better to have hunters in reserve.
---
Honestly you're the only one who can answer this question. Whether you're from Serbia or Norway doesn't really matter. What matters is how impactful $15 is to you. If it's far too much to part with, then maybe WoW isn't worth it.  
---
The amount that you can afford, no matter which country, is a relative problem that only you know the answer to.  
---
I live in a fairly wealthy country and there was a period where I couldn't afford the sub fee at all. It all just varies based on your life situation.  
---
Why SS and evisc after mainland. I get the WF part, but not the reason why it's helpful for alliance.
---
Leveling is hard in Vanilla/BC compared to Wrath and Cata. Hard as in you can die if you make a mistake. In Wrath and on, virtually any class has a wide enough kit and enough heirlooms to solo elites without breaking a sweat. It was tedious, but as a game, it was leaps more challenging in the older game. 
---
I also don‚Äôt know anyone that quit because Cata was too challenging. The dungeon nerfs happened before the mass exodus that lead to the steady decline that continues today. Raids were fun and challenging, though. 
---
Because you can find treasure of course, those handy chests and crates full of snacks and vendor bargains.
---
Yes, i undestand that and i am willing to spend for atleast 2 months of game time. I'm just asking if its actually hard to get that wow token.
---
If you choose to only kill greens on a PVE server then nothing. But, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll find if you reexperience it, when you are out in the open world there is a lot that can kill you. Tight spaces make me feel claustrophobic and endangered in the old game, whereas tightly clumped mobs in the modern game just means more creatures I can 1 shot with a single DoT for easier xp.
---
yep, yellow buttons were basically the other analog stick.
---
People will get mad if you keep making the same mistake/don‚Äôt listen to advice on how to avoid said mistake. Thing is, everyone will make those mistakes from time to time, tanks will do a bad pull, dps will stand on fire or ass pull, healers will heal the wrong person or lose focus. The point is to never think you‚Äôre perfect and always try to improve. 
---
If someone yells at you for no good reason, just put them on your ignore list and move on :) it‚Äôs most likely them that are the problem. 
---
You‚Äôll be fine, play what you want to play. This game works better when players build each other up, not tear them down! 
---
Same idea as wind fury, but less frequent, and thus less important. Sword specialization in the combat tree gives you a 5% chance to get an extra swing on any attack. If you have hand of justice it‚Äôs another 2%, making it even more important. 
---
Huh. So I assume you won't have herb or mining during leveling, right?
---
I would personally say its not worth it at all to get into retail wow.
---
I won't comment on private servers other than try it for yourself if you're looking for Vanilla gameplay.
---
Well we also have the new situation, of having the older games preserved in their own state. So if thats how people want to play it, the older game is there. But I have very different memories of trying to form a group for any 1-60 dungeon pre 3.3. Even as a tank, it took so long to find 4 people interested when only 30% of the population was involved in 1-60.
---
Oh duh sword spec and HOJ. Ok I haven't played PS so I'm a little rusty.
---
To be fair you‚Äôre partially conflating what the retail experience was like compared to mega servers like Nost (10k population daily or whatever). 
---
Wait, so if you do it after the MH attack rather than, what difference does that make? Doesn't sword spec and HOJs extra swing get procced off OH?
---
Well, what's our definition of "fail"?
---
It definitely won't be anything like it used to be. It won't take over retail. 
---
We also stand to lose time. Idk about you man but I‚Äôve got about one last 1-60 leveling and pre raid gearing left in me. If Blizzard fucks this up I might be over WoW. 
---
That‚Äôs probably a better question to ask on /r/wow
---
Thrall is slightly easier due to the backdoor. Easiest to kill is night elf in darnassus. No alliance there to defend her.
---
hardest is magni, no backdoor, well protected and the entire alliance population is there.  Stormwind is about on the same level as thrall due to it being easier to get to, but due to the tram, you are on a pretty hard timer to kill him before the entire population of ironforge walks over.
---
I love Vanilla.  I‚Äôm so looking forward Classic, and I can‚Äôt wait to play the hell out of that grindy, imbalanced, wonderful game again.  
---
A lot of people who played WoW with me back in the day aren‚Äôt currently planning on playing Classic, but several are.  And I‚Äôm sure that other friends will start playing for the first time and experience the fun of grouping up to overcome Elites, pvp, sharing, and drama.  
---
I‚Äôm not trying to force my old WoW friends to play again.  I‚Äôm actually looking forward to making NEW friends in Classic.  
---
It was definitely the fucking Dwarf.  Your route to him was either through tram, which meant going through Stormwind giving ample notice.  Or running into Iron Forge past the AH with the entire alliance population just chilling there.
---
Thrall there was at least kind of a back door from the Barrens/Azshara/Ashenvale entrance into Orgrimmar. 
---
Absolutely! For me Arthas is one of the deepest and most compelling stories in Warcraft lore. I love the book, I love Warcraft III, and I loved WotLK. 
---
I find that raid leaders vary, but the good ones tend to keep it cool. With 40 people to manage there's always something to yell about, there's better ways to direct the group. Otherwise they will be screaming all night.
---
being a healer and having fun at the same time requires a certain... disposition. especially if you're playing a priest, since that class was basically built for fucking with everyone.
---
as long as you've learned how to do your thing and are generally good at keeping people alive, don't worry about all the crying. when it comes to dealing with dickheads, [see this thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/aocjmu/lets_get_prepared_to_blame_the_healer/)
---
take note, however! as fun as priests are, they are the prime target in pvp situations, especially healers, since a good priest can fuck even your best laid plans up in a few clicks.
---
The only kind of benefit the Horde had was the alliance population was split between IF and SW.
---
A druid caught out in the open can easily be killed by a rogue, but a druid in a duel with one is a completely different story.
---
Does Bolvar count? Watched quite a few wipes on Draka back in the day, never seen him down first hand. 
---
a half year later even twinks are allowed. but at first we have no rogues but a lot off-tanks and otter dd¬¥s
---
Yeah. While I think the sub numbers are important to think about, context is important. At WoW's height in sub numbers, there was no other genre of multiplayer online game that was booming or particularly present other than MMO's, and specifically MMO RPG's at that.
---
But then you have LoL, HoN, and later Dota 2 show up and MOBA's get to be really big. Younger players start playing these a lot.
---
Now a few more years down the line, the MOBA's are still popular but now the Battle Royale Shooters are huge and young players are pouring into these games. MOBA's are second fiddle, and MMO's seem to be left behind as something people no longer play.
---
BFA isn't very good, sure, and the sub numbers are down for plenty of reasons, but let's not ignore the context of gaming in general and the trends going on there.
---
I might be the only one on this board that would be down for Retail art/animations/graphics/etc and Vanilla everything else üòÜ 
---
in pvp, a good blind macro makes a world of difference, something that tells others not to hit that motherfucker.
---
&gt;If that isn't what you wanted to do, you wouldn't need it
---
Don't assume you know what I or anyone else finds fun. Meaningful PvP in Azeroth that occurs around important resources, while fighting World Bosses, or near instances is part of what makes Vanilla so compelling.
---
It isn't about the ability to gank low levels- it's about the ability to interact with the opposite faction in a meaningful and competitive way that isn't for points.
---
Fact is, it might be in Blackrock Mountian for the enjoyment of killing the opposite faction- it might be in Un'goro to kill someone contesting devilsaur spawns while you're farming gold, or it might be on a hill in blasted lands right after Kazzak spawns.
---
There will be assholes. You need to remember however in classic servers will have a limit amount of players. This generally leads to players been more likely to help you then flame you as they'd prefer to have priest they can group with. Won't always be the case but from playing private servers that's how i've notice it
---
1 handed axe, mace, sword
---
Retail is a waste in terms of everything, and for all that is holy don't become a gold farmer for Blizzard.
---
Yeah it's not classic, he said wrath if you read it again.
---
You know you can mute any sound in the game right? Muting the elemental as a mage is a must. 
---
Thrall is quite a lot easier due to the backdoor, actually. Alliance can use the entrance into the building as a natural chokepoint and disallow Horde from getting in afterwards. Most of the NPC's around Thrall are also pretty whatever.
---
Sylvanas is pretty notable on the other hand. She's crowded with all sorts of annoying NPC's. The war masters themselves are decently strong, and other BG related NPC's will continuously flood the throne room with guards. On top of that Varimathras and Sylvanas actually have abilities of note, unlike Thrall and Vol'jin. If UC was constantly filled with as much people as Orgrimmar, it'd be the hardest city to down for sure.
---
I've run into quite a few players in thier early teens on vanilla pservers waiting for classic to launch and learning the game. Very refreshing to see. 
---
&gt;Maybe herbing to transition to alchemy
---
Bingo
---
Send your greens to a level 5 bank alt with enchanting to disenchant.  Most of what you're going to be making leveling tailoring cheaply is going to be white anyways.
---
I‚Äôm not even sure what your trying to say exactly but I have to say there are many rogues if good enough are know.  
---
One side note: be prepared at lower levels for people to try and run a dungeon like it is retail (no stopping, no cc, not caring about the healers Mana). Once you get to mid range and higher that should stop since people will realize it's different.
---
Your issue is you thought this was a debate. It wasn't. It was me trying to helpfully explain that most people think blizzard is now garbage and why so many people feel that way. You disagree, that is fine. You are welcome to your opinion. Have a great day. 
---
Sorry what I meant was you press your attack when the MH swing timer resets (0.0/2.7), not lands, wether thats normally or from an extra attack proc from either weapon.
---
Offhand damage is negligible. 
---
Right but why does it help? Do SS and Evisc reset the swing timer?
---
i actually didn't play in vanilla proper! i've been playing on a private server (tho holding off now to be refreshed for summer) and looking forward to doing that quest on classic :D
---
&gt; The feeling of helping people is great.
---
It's why I rolled Priest back in 2005. It's not even just in raids and dungeons, people often appreciate your Fort buffs (there was an addon that automatically chose the right rank for the targeted player, because that's not an automatic thing in Vanilla); With players being relatively weak compared to mobs in Vanilla, you'll even get to save some asses outdoors.
---
Mind, you, there always are some ungrateful bastards that won't even pick greyed-out mobs off of you that the heal you threw them (and that probably saved them a trip from the graveyard) aggroed onto you.
---
Concerning "proper" group play: Vanilla is great in that you generally have a good survey of the battle you're fighting - especially as healer. It's usually pretty clear who pulled another group of mobs, or if a runner didn't get hunted down. Even in cases where the healer is blamed (as said, there always will be right bastards in any game), you usually can pinpoint the actual reason for a wipe. In most groups, you'll have enough people with a good understanding of the game mechanics to corroborate what *actually* happened.
---
Best of all, however, is that full-blooded healers usually are pretty rare, and Vanilla does not have a random group finder. This means that over time, you can build a name for yourself, and a blacklist for the bastards. 
---
Quite honestly, I payed and enjoyed my healing priest in Vanilla and BC, but from WotLK onwards, the RDF soured me completely on the role.

I'm not sure why you're being down-voted but this is exactly what's going to happen, so long as you're providing the tanks and healers for the raid.  If you're a dps forming a AQ20 pug and you try to reserve anything with out supplying the tanks/healers some tank's going to tell you to piss off and offer to reform the group without you.
---
&gt;Your issue is you thought this was a debate. It wasn't.
---
I was joking about the debate. 
---
Thanks for taking the time to explain that to me. Ultimately I think a lot of those expectations are unrealistic/unreasonable.  You have a great day, too!
---
You seem to have some kind of vendetta against rogues (or you're just trolling). Rogues are pretty consistently the second highest dps class after fury warriors, and a full naxx seal fate rogue might be top top dps.
---
Just remember the gear side of things if you feel angry at someone. There is a difference between fucking up and just not having big enough numbers.

I‚Äôve been healing as a main since Vanilla.  Yes, some fools will blame you for their death, even when they don‚Äôt move out of the fire.  Or, if you aren‚Äôt as good as the other players, they may be unreasonably rude.  
---
But as a healer, you‚Äôll be in great demand, so you‚Äôll be able to pick whom you group with.

Classic won't fail because it's just nostalgia. Implemened correctly Classic is a timeless master-piece. Classic will fail tho because Activision will fuck it up.
---
A bit off topic but how fast do the guilds normal get the first clear on private servers? Is it just a case of waiting for warriors or can a faster leveling class like druids tank well enough to get through MC?

This guy brings up some good reasons to avoid playing on streamer servers: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ev-cy000SaM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ev-cy000SaM)

It might be fun for a day or two, but playing on streamer servers might ruin your experience in the long run.

POCKET SAND %T SHA SHA SHA

This has a lot of truth to it.  Priest is a hybrid and if you're only going to be shadow and have no interest in popping out and healing players when needed and have a sense of responsibility as a support player then I wouldn't go anywhere near the class.
---
Classes aren't specs, you need to zoom back out and look at the classes as a whole OP.
---
&gt; Alliance has the upper hand in all aspects of vanilla wow though. 
---
Horde have the conveniently placed dungeons.  Running WC, SFK, SM at the appropriate level is aids for the Alliance.  Even RFD/RFK is kind of annoying compared to the Horde's route.
---
When I played BfA on launch I got randomly kicked from time to time when we got close to the final boss. The so called "community" is just pure cancer if you don't play with people you know, or people from your large social guild for example. That's the difference between classic and retail, in classic you will spend probably 2-3 hours together and people won't (95% of the times) act like assholes simply because nobody wants to return to the major cities and start looking for another healer.. which could take an hour+ on a bad day.
---
Not to mention that it's pretty normal to wipe in classic and people don't mind it as much.
---
It can proc an extra attack from WF/sword spec/HoJ/Ironfoe/Thrash Blade, which resets the swing timer (I think for both weps but definitely for MH)
---
Ok that makes sense. So SS and Evisc do not reset the swing timer right?
---
you can put most post-cata old world zones into one of three categories:
---
1) not really changed looks-wise. applies to zones like feralas, duskwood, elwynn forest, ect.
---
2) only partially changed looks-wise. eg, desolace is the same except for the lush forest in the middle, ashenvale is the same except for the giant raging volcano, westfall's got that tornado in the middle of it, ect. 
---
3) totally changed looks-wise. thousand needles wasn't always flooded and is the biggest example of this i think
---
other things to note is that in vanilla not every zone had its own unique soundtrack - there were a lot of themes for certain environments that were then applied to multiple zones. cataclysm gave a lot of zones their own unique theme and going to a different theme can totally change the vibe of the zone. for example, the music in vanilla darkshore heavily contributes to a more creepy and ominous atmosphere, whereas the music in cata darkshore is very sad and they feel totally different. 
---
a lot of quest chains you may be familiar with are also still there in vanilla, they've just been compressed in cata. for example, if you've ever done the legend of stalvan questline in duskwood, the information you get is the same, but instead of picking up the pages in various worgen camps around duskwood you go to many different zones - have to go pick up a letter delivered to stalvan while he was in goldshire? then you go to goldshire, ect ect. 
---
really glad you're giving classic a shot, enjoy it :D
---
All just fancy ways of saying, "I want to grief people while they're busy doing other shit."
---
They CAN reset it the same as any weapon attack, it's only if you get an extra attack proc, which resets the timer back to 0.0
---
Yeah, I mean, sans proc, abilities do not reset the timer on their own. Thanks for the clarification.
---
I agree about the timers haha. I know they have to do something to probably eliminate some fishy comps trivializing content... but timers just added unnecessary stress imo. Would love to see added mechanics, etc. as means to increase difficulty rather than just saying "You better pray you can chain pull fast enough!" Granted there's positives about timers, but I pretty much agree with you that it wasn't great for me either. But yeah, not having content be irrelevant after two weeks was super refreshing.
---
yep :)
---
The idea is that if u press SS at 2.6/2.7 MH timer and get an extra attack proc, it's basically a wasted proc.
