My personal plan is to leave my characters at lvl 60 no matter what happens. I want full tier 3 Druid and t2 rogue. And 5 years from now if I want to log in and pvp I can.

Unless you’re a wannabe tryhard who thinks WoW is the most important thing on earth... guilds are not hard to get into to see all the content.
---
Ep
---
It had been working relatively correctly until this morning.
---
Wrong. 
---

---
Agi&gt; str at lower levels.
---
Nope.
---
From 52-54+ do dungeons till 60. Its slower at times, but you need to do brd alot of times anyway for your attunements and bis gear. Add the tanks from dungeonruns to your friendlist (or find a guildgroup, or fun dungeongroup) so you can gear and levelup through dungeons together (even better if you can find a solid group and join voicechat together!). Might even result in a suitable guild if you find a fun group of likeminded people during the dungeonruns!
---
Dont forget about you raid talentspec tho.. if youre tanking to level but want to heal/dps at 60 you kinda need to gather gear for that along the way (some quests offer trinkets that force u to choose for your 60 spec!).
---
Gold and professions meh, that epic mount and goldfarming is something to kill time in between raids and more efficient at 60. Dont feel bothered to get your epic mount too fast.
---
Why does it surprise you that when something was new it wasn't as researched as it is 15 years later?
---
Maul can use counter weight
---
Transfer outs are nearly open 24/7, but only to two other OCE pvp servers
---
DS/ruin is a million times better DPS. And the longer the game goes as gear increases it just becomes better. DOTS can't crit in vanilla, remember this.
---
It's almost like this guy doesn't know Paladins can hold threat on 10+ mobs and do 50DPS per mob.
---
That housing content wouldn't tie up people indefinitely. They tried it in retail and it was a fiasco. New content will kill wow classic. Private servers kept people playing vanilla for over 10 years. The only solution is to implement pvp, release the rest of the raids and tweak the endgame to be harder. Whoever likes it will keep making alts and trying different things , the rest will move on.
---
i bet blizzard thinks people won't even resub for pvp
---
Ironforge looks the same, at the same time just between the bank and the AH. (Also play on Arugal)
---
All of the following were complete unknowns until classic wow. This means that they were either 1.12 remnants that private servers never got right, unique 1.13 mechanics, or things previously uninvestigated.
---
- Paladin SotC/SoR seal twisting (as opposed to SoC/SoR)
---
- Paladin weapon twisting
---
- Paladin Greater Blessing spam tps
---
- Warrior Slam-WF interaction
---
- Warrior Heroic Strike offhand interaction (previously discovered during retail wotlk and fixed back then, but never on 1.12)
---
- Druid instant powershifting (as opposed to taking two button presses on 1.12)
---
- Buff slot mechanics (mostly a negative)
---
- A bunch of threat-related crap that I don't really understand. But the warrior discord guys did a ton of interesting testing on this.
---
- And lastly there's the fantastic mess that is instant attack procs( Reckoning/Windfury/HoJ/Sword Spec/Thrash Blade).
---
An example of new gameplay, both related to the last point, is paladins manually managing their white hits (as opposed to autoattack) to effectively triple their attack speed in a 1v1 scenario. Another is warriors instantly Cleaving by proccing WF with a Hamstring, bypassing their swing timer.
---
What's Shaman like to level and endgame? I have no experience as my main is on alliance but am considering making a Tauren Shaman on another realm.
---
My worries are that its a Hybrid spec so you're gonna struggle between doing damage and healing, which is your good role. How does that work in endgame for making money, PvP, raiding etc. Is there much stigma with being a ele/ench scrub like ret paladins got?
---
Default name plates.
---
Yeah I agree. What if instead if was a BoE that another member actually needed, but I could sell on the AH for 10 gold? Can I need that? With this logic, I am entitled to roll for that.
---
Just to make it clear, I wouldn't, it's just a little frustrating seeing the double standard the community has set where we set need before greed, unless it's over an arbitrary gold amount.
---
not unless you're on an overpopulated server
---
Wait what?
---
Drop tailor make money with herb and get engineering
---
I know this bud. I doubt highly that the healer was pulling threat off me.
---
Did you really buy into the people who said classic was a harder game? Gameplay wise live is harder, classic is about the D&amp;D experience and better social interactions.
---
Same on EN, all PvE servers layered.
---
Full prebis would be 412 shadow damage...
---
6+2 is better than BiS but as soon as you break up the set bonus with one new piece your dps goes way down.
---
With the new level squish for shadowlands, wouldn't be surprised to see an option to move your classic character to retail in the future, dropping them down to 50.
---
For melee dps, the haste one isnt that much worse
---
Can u explain this for my dumbass lol
---
Farm your BiS gear to 60... if that means do a quest or chain to get it... do that... if that means grinding hundreds of demons or DM for demonic runes to make robe of the void. Do it. just dont bother rushing to 60 as fast as possible. Get your BiS gear and the levels will come on their own. 
---
If you somehow get a lot of it before you hit 60 and are happy with where you are at then spam scholo to rush to 60
---
This.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Honestly I wouldn't go for shadowcraft, rogues get tier pieces quite frequently and just a piece or two is going to completely nullify all the hard work you put into prebissing shadowcraft. Just get the prebis for individual pieces, need on the shadowcraft if it drops.
---
I’m not a warlock but as a healer I can tell you it’s not locks dying in mc, unless they do some stupid life taps, it’s mostly melee that dies a lot in mc.  I really don’t think having damage reduction talents will help much.  But doing really really bad dps will certainly hurt.
---
Perhaps not BIS issue more of a tangent. The point stands that TBC added a lot of QOL that to me makes current classic not feasible due to time constraints. It's  still fun to level and play a simpler game but endgame isnt feasible. 30mins to find a group. 30mins for everyone to gather then 1-3hours inside without wipes. Wish I was still in college but alas that's not the case. 
---
We all have different opinions. I'm pro dungeonfinder. Maybe  I'll shelf my priest and level my mage. Maybe I'll try retail (I have several 85's). Maybe I'll make my wife happy and quit.
---
Have fun!
---
Wildheart is BiS.
---
what raid frames is that?
---
LoS / range. Would you take any other 1v4 fight?
---
According to blizzard the servercap is unaffected by layering, so it shouldn't result in more queues.
---
Gratz for being a shining example of the toxic community within Classic.
---
"you apparently don't even know how logging works"
---
I know enough that I can read a log without relying on the fight being "parsed" to know who is dispelling or not in my raid...**competent raid leaders livelog**.
---
When you learn half as much as you think you do, you'll realize that players can game parses and that you'll need to learn how to interpret those data in the logs rather than simply relying on an algorithmic ranking system telling you if the members on your raid team did their jobs or not.
---
RIP alliance.
---
If this is true, then yea my comment is a little of base. Didn't know there is a long history of this specific player doing shit like this.
---

I fucking hate the word primo. Reminds me of this nerd ass Paladin from WotLK that was telling me how he was a primo healer and yada yada... he sucked.
---
Edit: also if you are Denialz from Fight Club in Baelgun back in Wrath... up yours nerd.
---
This is not true..undead females do mad flips for their combat animations.  Which is cooler.
---
No ur fine fuk sake
---
Don't really need it. Content is too easy. Just stack all +healing blue gear and get as much mana/5 where it makes sense and down rank your heals. I have zero mana issues on current content and I doubt I will in bwl either. You'll have way more +healing in blue cloth gear than you will in t1 shaman gear.
---
It's not bad though. But it's not game breaking to get t1 set bonus. It's really only a pvp set if you ask me.
---
He has us there in spirit.
---
fear ward for nef is the only reason
---
So maybe you can go to the caverns of time and enter a portal that takes you instanced expansion universes. Wanna play MoP? Jump in a portal. Back to BC? Jump in a portal. Your same character can enter any of these universes but their skills and inventory are left at the door when they jump to another expansion. With this type of play model, the developers can give the player base access to any expansion they wish to play without fear of dividing their player base. They can add content for classic players in the form of an “alternate timeline” that you can choose to participate in or not. Idk I’m kind of drunk but it seems like an idea.
---
Juicy as fuark
---
Keep it up!
---
The content's so trivial it doesn't matter though
---
Depends how you play
---
If you only use mount on the way to dungeons/raids, then you spend more time using the helm than the mount
---
4 mins on epic mount = 5 mins on normal mount
---
If you can farm 50g per hour (which might be high for some), then it would take 18 hours of farming for epic mount. Which means you have to spend 72 hours riding on epic mount to make up for the time spend on getting it
---
And if you can farm 40g per hour it’s 90 hours!
---
So if you don’t plan on pvping much or farming mats, then I would argue it’s worth considering if you need it
---
Bye Felika
---
TBC and after that WOTLK. The Three Holy Eras of WoW. Everything went downhill after that.
---
Serious question, really not trying to be a dick.  But how do you not already have that done as a guild when pug mc raids kill rag easily?
---
Your rage trickles down out of combat. You can use Bloodrage to stay in combat for longer, though.
---
As for what Tactical Mastery does; normally you lose all rage when switching stances. Tactical Mastery basically just changes the maximum rage you can carry over from stance to stance by 5 per point. So if you have 50 rage in Battle Stance and switch to Defensive, you'll have 25 rage instead of 0.

---
ITT Bad players dont understand 2 hand tanking. 
---
Macro your weapon swaps and jump back to shield when you arent bursting. Charge &gt; Sweeping strikes &gt; Zerker rage &gt; Whirlwind and then to defensive stance gives you a solid threat lead on the pack and doesn't incur too much extra damage. 
---
Be aware that you generate considerably less threat outside of defensive stance, its 130% of damage instead of 80, id recommend speccing defiance in the prot tree if you haven't, that pushes you to 149.5% also worth mentioning that you dont necessarily need improved shield block tanking outside of a raid so dont feel totally locked to it for dungeons, you likely wont have enough rage to use it regularly and its potentially six points that can go elsewhere.
---
As for tanking difficulty that depends a lot on your DPS, if they're all split firing it doesn't matter how good you are the pack will be running amok. Personally I find skull to my mouse so I can live target shift.
---
ill show u some meat u cant skip

Lol the OP is making himself look like an 8 year old who didn’t get his way, this thread is hilarious
---
I can't wait to feast on all these squishy bis aoe spam mages oh boy

Thanks.
---
Yeah I agree with you on those points
---
I have a lock and priest both at level 40. I could feasibly only get one to 60 by thr time pvp releases.  Which will have an easier time finding groups and raids and grtting fully geared? I enjoy playing both about the same.
---
You play at peak hours on a full server. 
---
Mystery solved, let’s go back to all those people exploiting every single valuable Matt possible. Yea, I like seeing everyone’s bank alt full to the brim with exploited loot.

Are hunters screwed end-game wise when Naxx comes around? I'm leaning hunter over warlock, but Warlocks seem to be top DPS when Naxx comes around and Hunters seem to be at the bottom. Some people even say that you don't need hunters for Naxx so it'll be hard to find raids for it.
---
Shoulder she be "General Trades Goods Goods"
---
So here's the main issue with what you said, and I get where you're coming from, not every guild is able to put in the same amount of time effort.
---
But your guild is FAR behind the curve of power that most folks that raid are on.  THAT'S OKAY! Like you said, your lifestyle doesn't support it as much as you'd like it to.
---
But with that in mind, you shouldn't make statements that are just objectively wrong in the grand scheme of raiding.
---
Healing isn't an issue in MC.  Unavoidable damage isn't an issue in MC.
---
Hell, there are very few actual issues in MC.  This is retail LFR level raiding compared to how it used to be.
---
Don't suggest something that is so niche as the best option when it really only applies to severely behind players. That's silly.
---
No one says a suv is the best racecar because they have to carry their kids to soccer as well.
---
I mean it was the same back in vanilla.  People were well aware of what dropped where for the most part.  Thottbot already had all that there.
---
Sure it’s more pervasive now and the builds are more cookie cutter since a lot more research has gone in to what makes a good build.  But certainly people back then would not want to run dungeons that didn’t drop anything they were interested in unless helping guild ones/friends etc.
---
Grats guys! Wish I could’ve joined you
---
i just think 1-12 for keybinds works best cause i got a razer naga
---
the SV SX ST i think would be werid
---
Personally I would not base my class purely on Naxx unless you already have a pserver guild that is heavily min maxing.
---
Would like to see you figure out how to solo farm this boss  without seeing this video on a shadow priest
---
hemo with big slow swords
---
I have the 4 set shadow missing head and chest piece and using the 2 set devilsaur, should I stick with this instead of splitting it up for truestrikes? And was wondering do I wear the head and chest piece?
---
Doesn't seem to work?
---
How they get put on ignore instantly LOL, this and anyone that dares admit they play retail
---
If you want to raid, you’ll most likely have to specc resto. There are one off enh shammys in some raids who have nightfall but in general it’s resto. This also makes solofarming a royal pain in the ass. Shaman is a support class that shines in groups. Battlegrounds is more fun though since elemental is very strong with good reach and crazy lightning bolt into chain lightning combos.
---
Sounds like something a teenager would say so I'm pretty sure I'm nailing it.
---
You can sim gear to a single digit dps upgrade in retail in 2 minutes...

---
I think you mean the virgin jawline vs the chad negative canthal tilt.
---
I've been healing since lvl 1 and haven't ever respecced but that's cause I love resto a lot. I think if you like healing you are pretty much the fav. type of healer for people to have (esp. for warriors and rogues due to windfury totem mainly). Endgame healing is good because groups always have a spot for me to join and there isnt much loot competition. Drawbacks are leveling goes a bit slower, you aren't very hard to kill in pvp, and if you don't like healing then well you will be quite bored doing resto for all of your 60 lvls....
---
I can't really speak for enh/elemental. I rarely see elemental that's for sure, enhancement seemed really popular up till around lvl 50 where now I don't see as many at all at 60. I think their dps is pretty strong though (enh that is) so they are plenty viable I would believe. Elemental not sure, not sure... But you may get shit for being a dps when you "could" heal, so that's the risk of endgame dps, when really you shouldn't be given shit of course for just having a preference for one spec over the other.
---
You need stamina in bwl. Tier provides it and some resistance
---
How is that constantly moving bar not incredibly annoying

This is like reading a boomer’s Facebook.

I think people are quick to forget PSservers have kept classic rolling for fifteen years. They don’t have to keep adding on to keep people playing. Ultimately the population will dip and maybe there only ends up being a server or two, but the audience for it probably isn’t going away. 
---
I think if nothing else, I’d like to see them do full server resets eventually. Just to keep things fresh.
---
The worst part is I lose my tribute buffs.
---
Go for BiS, the 4 piece set bonus is not good enough to care.
---
Both would be fine in my opinion, my server seems to have a bunch of healers around but hey can't hurt to be able to heal or dps. Locks are underplayed though and needed for banishes on mc too.
---
Hahahaha awesome
---
Is that not just for retail?
---
Or you can wait for a horde to summon him, use aspect of the cheetah and distracting shot to kite Echeyakee with you into the sunset and tame it when you've lost the horde
---
They're suggesting you get TSM as an AH addon instead. I don't use Auctionator, so I'm unaware if it keeps inventory but, as bakagir suggests, TSM does and you can pull that info up by simply typing the command /tsm. I know this wasn't much help, sorry.
---
And I don't only use my most +shadow damage set so that I can survive easier. I have replaced shadow wrath gear with either T1 or optional pre-raid bis like deadwalker mantle or robes of the royal crown. No way would I get 3.6k hp in a set that gives 412 shadow damage.
---
Please share some insights to us warlock learners. Your specc, your damage rotation at different sorts of mob packs etc.
---
If everyone in your guild makes that decision you have 25 players doing 3% less damage, which is a shit ton of damage.
---
You wanna help your healers?  Kill the boss 45 seconds faster.
---
People won’t be raiding cities post-honour system launch.  Too many dishonourable kills.
---
damn players were truly in a sorry state back then if they're worse than a 5 year old.
---
It should be, probably the scummiest thing to do in game.
---
sounds like you're mad because he makes gold
---
from my experience in MC so far lock loot drops like crazy and they get geared quick cause there aren't too many in runs. i don't think it's even that people don't want locks, there just aren't that many. priests would be wanted for heals but there are more open spots for dps than there are for heals so idk how easy it is to get into a guild, though you'd be more wanted for raid pugs i think.
---
This is why i hope stadia succeeds. You can have an mmo on a cloud server. With nothing stored locally nothing can be datamined and the discovery experience in mmos could make a comeback. Forcing people to try different things and explore again rather then have everythijg mapped oit for you in a week.
---
so should I break my 4 piece if I get truestrikes?
---
Nochanges
---
"Fucking healer cant heal"
---
It’s kind of a pain to set up, and doesn’t always do what’s it’s told when you enable and disable it.
---
I’ve thought of this as well and totally vouch for it. There are ADDONS that do this tho.
---
BWL will be a joke. Everyone will be geared to the teeth by the time it releases. Hell, the gear we have now would be enough to clear it. 1.12 pre raid bis gear is OP as hell.
---
AQ &amp; naxx will have a few challenges however.
---
Yea this addon.
---
Wowhead lets you filter by Phase as  well.
---
Then why are you Dinklage the gnome and not Dinklage the dwarf? I mean Peter Dinklage has dwarfism, and is definitely not a gnome.
---
Drain does more dps than wands after like 38 when you spec into it, so it’s a mana positive spell that does more dps than my auto attack.
---
I think you are spot on, and it allows them to find a way to link classic into the greater content pushes. That way, classic doesn’t necessarily orphan players long term. I am cautiously optimistic.
---
I though this was not in classic. I do not know why it works but it does.
---
It might be related to the broker everything addon performing a command that opens it, but it works.
---
But it's not another debuff slot since it doesn't have priority over the other 16 so it won't overwrite existing ones.
---
Judging from how you responded when they didn't help, I'm sure the call for help wasn't very inviting
---
Afaik you can enter UD side, open the gate and there's a spot on the left (basically you stand a tiny but under/inside the gate) where you can summon Eye of Kilrog and get it through the gate wthout you aggroing the mob group.
---
100g really can be farmed in a few hours. Farm some herbs or mining. 
---
Even just some elementals or Welps for their fire sacs. 
---
You could even fish and make 100g in no time.

Main issue is that the 1.12 pre-raid bis gear from dungeons is just way too good. We didn't have access to that back in the day for most of vanilla's cycle.
---
Or my ...top ten speedclear guild..?
---
the only difference is pvp.  fear ward is amazing in pvp, shadowmeld is a meme
---
If u wanna raid all resets u still need to do a raidnight with only onxia once in a while since it resets every 5 days instead of 7. And for this raid its normal to skip the respecc
---
90% of the time when you group in end game there is going to be at least one ass hole who ruins or kills the vibe. Your honestly having the most fun right now instead of getting scammed by all the 60s. (Mostly healers) tanks get away with just about anything g in this game
---
58 Holy paladin here. I have a question about looting cloth items.
---
Often I am in groups with casters, and a cloth item will drop which is extremely useful to me because of spell power and/or intellect &amp; spirit.
---
However because I am privileged to wear non-cloth items, should I be leaving these items to the casters who can only wear cloth?
---
I don’t have an encyclopaedic knowledge of what is BiS for each class but I imagine that comes into play into this decision.
---
I guess I'm a boomer at heart.
---
Repent, zoomer!
---
First answer is play what's fun. If the class isn't fun then it isn't for you.
---
Second to that, what role do you want? If you're going to raid, you need to pick tank, dps, or heals. If you're obsessed with min/maxing and want to be top dps or whatever, check out the tier lists at wowhead. Keep in mind those will change or move as the game phases roll out, but they should give you an idea. They are also very skill dependent- back when I played vanilla on retail, there would frequently be heavy dps outliers- hunters that topped dps charts in Naxx (when they supposedly weren't supposed to), and rogues that would beat out frost mages in MC. Skill, and 'feel for the class' matters more than whichever class is supposedly top tier. For PVP, I really like lock, hunter, or shadow priest.
---
As far as feeling lonely, that's all about the community you find. Horde or Alliance, the game is more fun when played with friends, period. There isn't a right or wrong answer, it's just who you find.
---
does the guild chat tab with chat history work? miss that feature from retail
---
This entire sub reads like a boomer's Facebook.
---
We literally have had 12+ Earthfury Bracers drop for our guild the past month.. So much so that every off spec shaman has one and now they get auctioned lol.
---
Oh and the drop for Benidiction has only dropped once out of the 6 or 7 times we've killed Domo. (which is 50% drop, we're at 15% drop rate)  So RNG be pretty wild like that
---
Well nothing is objectively "hard", it is moreso of a time investment. Like if you have been chasing your bis list and have 25+ days played at this point I would assume you had it even if you are a garbage tier player.
---
Yep, this works and so does voice chat, you can actually use Blizzard Group Chat to talk to the enemy faction on PVP realms by using a console command that sends them an invite to the chat lol
---
Yea was Omw to strat and damn near walked over a black lotus.. 60g in the matter of a few seconds. Most herbs are going up in price atm too.
---
We're also on Yojamba &lt;We Are Farmers&gt; and we downed Rag last night! Our tank died 3 times and the last 1% was evasion tanked, but we got there!
---
Edit: Got him on 2nd attempt, first attempt he got to - 9hp as he submerged for 2nd time, and we pretty much wiped there
---
Casual guild.  
---
The guild consists of lot of players who only hit 60 the past 2 week.  
---
Lack the numbers to do a full guild run so we have to PUG a lot. And those who we PUG, with some noticeable exceptions, are lacking (to put it kindly).  
---
A lot of the early 60s help the new 60s to farm, and this can slow down progression a bit.
---
Boom
---
Is there not realm forums or LFG forums on battle.net?
---
This is awesome.  Have you had any issues with high level alliance camping you?
---
It can... if you were a dwarf.
---
I've been laughing about this reply for 2 hours. Solid work
---
I wouldn't worry about dungeons, unless you're tanking it's pretty easy
---
PuG are usually over geared for the content they do, with specific (read ; leaders friends) being at the right gear level or under to start MC.
---
Some guilds would rather take 20 under geared people from guild deaths than pug more people from outside. 
---
Some people even if they're 60 haven't had time to grind out their Pre-BiS.
---
Some people just aren't that good at playing the game.
---
There's nothing wrong with guilds still progressing through content. They're allowed to be slower than pugs.
---
At this stage in a release cycle I'd reccomend getting your gear set up in a spreadsheet. As people say 4 piece isnt worth much here but there will be a lot of breakpoints you come across moving forward.
---
Personally the biggest thing to me was always knowing how impactful an upgrade would be. Sometimes your optimal is so fractionally better than where you are that its delusional to chase it.
---
For reference I once realised that I was stressing about an upgrade that was going to yield less than 5dps on a theoretical maximum that was just shy of 20,000. Mathematically optimal isnt necessarily related to sensible.
---
That's just an idiot person. The same kind of person who tries to tank on their warrior and charges in with 30% HP and the healer OOM. The same kind of person who tries to heal with their priest and MCs mobs. That's not a fault with the class. It's a fault with the person.
---
Still not a good reason. If they're requesting a holy spec they are allowed to do that and you probably don't want to be in their group anyway. I leveled a shadow and healed dungeons, but if a group demanded holy spec I just found a different group.
---
In raid, if you're holding back the raid because you want to heal as shadow, you're an ass
---
As a rogue I’m triggered, rogues don’t pull anything we’re too squishy. We will however pull aggro off a tank cuz we go balls to the wall before the tank has established enough threat.
---
Are you us in an alternative reality where we chose to play Horde?
---
We just did our first Rag kill tonight too!

Don't wait on time. Wait on sunders if it's a warrior tank. One should be fine. Two is safe. For druids probably a slow count to three is fine. For pally tanks... get a class that can actually tank I guess since they don't have a taunt ability. Taunts are a requirement to tank 5 mans IMO.
---
As mentioned get a threat meter.
---
Few things here..
---
As you play more, you will discover there barely is any plate (and mail) healing gear. That means if you want the best items, you have to roll on pieces regardless of armor type. For a paladin, that simply means you have access to more options which makes it arguably easier to gear. 
---
About the stats part, while spell power is nice, what you really want is bonus healing. This is because the bonus healing has bigger numbers compared to spell damage. (For instance a damage gear could have 30 but a healing equivalent would have 50, just random numbers to illustrate). So, if a caster needs an item that has actual spell power, you should probably let them have it. Gren items with the suffix "of healing" are most probably better than whatever item just dropped. These green items "of healing" go for a few golds each but you can usually get some pretty cheap to jump-start your healing career!
---
Have fun playing paladin, i hope this helped
---
Spirit is very bad for paladins
---
You don’t have to go prot till 50ish at earliest
---
I'm having the same thoughts. It sucks, but not surprising the least (it would be if it wasn't like this). 10-ish years ago I loved raiding but now I'm working on my first alt the most. We cleared out almost the entire MC on the first go, it was kinda disappointing really. i knew this'll prolly happen, but still. The main thing that keeps my attention is more the community around me than the content.
---
Correct. Currently raiding with 9/31/11 and keeping up with the SM Ruin boys. I also like the flatter, less spiky damage. Hardly pulling any aggro compared to with Ruin
---
Oh you mean any twinking gear from a guide or any engineering pvp reagent or any raid/pvp consumable made by alchemy including herbs to make them? Or do you mean rare pets such as hyacinth macaw or oozeling? Or perhaps big time money making recipes such as transmute undeath to water?
---
pfft
---
It looks great but it plays like shit. It's camp or die in nearly every game...
---
Why did you try to heal without wanting to use anything to make your heal efficient? Doesnt really make sense. 
---
For the war you mainly just need a macro to swap weaps on the rest are normal binds. And you level as arms usually, and it works for tanking too you don't need prot to tank dungeons.
---
You know what you did.
---
My eye is twitching thinking about pugs in the supression room
---
I am leveling an undead priest, which professions should I take? Currently, I have clothing and skinning. Should I change one?
---
For the horde loktar ogar
---
It doesn’t help that nobody wants felheart either since it’s awful. It’s a good pvp set, but it’s garbage for raiding.
---
He shall receive a promotion and a monthly stipend of 400 rubles.
---
That shit skill is an AoE Searing pain.  Even if the tank took 50% of a mob's health, 2 ticks of Hellfire and you already pulled it.
---
Just   
---
/use [mod:shift] Rapid Fire;Hunter's Mark   
---
will work.
---
All undead rogues are actually playing from Hell. That’s the sound of tortured souls.
---
2nd hand embarrassed
---
Depends what you mean with "good". Overhealing(excluding HOTs) is a good way to measure the best mechanical healer.
---
Which you can say isn't very important in classic though with all the consumables and the content being a faceroll making mana a non issue.
---
So maybe you are right, topping both meters and using a hefty amount of consumables might actually be the "best" healers in classic.
---
He's an idiot, I pmed asking what up and he basically said shaman &gt; pally gtfo, typical 13 year old
---
In my opinion it's bad form to jump ahead of the people who have been working towards a particular spawn like that. 
---
But either way, even by the laws of first come first serve, all you did was beat them at their own game instead of getting fucked in the ass by respawns.
---
I think the UI complete with random bleeps just gave me cancer
---
The reason affliction suffers isn't min-max bullshit, it's that bosses have only 16 debuff slots. Having a single affliction lock eat up 4 of those will make everything more difficult and slower for 39 other people.
---
As to the argument about keepinh dark pact at 60...that's their choice but I'd say it offers no great advantage but comes with significant drawback in group play. Their choice though.
---
Ok sure, but it was still voted to the front page.
---
If you get teleported to IF it’s because you’re instance locked.
---
Kill rag before he spawns sons.
---
Is that the necklace you wore when vanilla first came out?.. I think it was out of style already then too though... haha jk bro! Good luck on the stream
---
Macros are probably a bigger deal for warriors than many classes because of the stance restrictions on so many abilities. 
---
Changing stances is on a different GCD than the normal GCD so you can change stances and use an ability at the same time. Macros are great for this. 
---
Examples: 
---
-	Battle Stance + Charge
---
-	Defensive Stance + Taunt
---
-	Berserker Stance + Pummel
---
-	Berserker Stance + Intercept 
---
-	Berserker Stance + Whirlwind
---
The list goes on and on and on....
---
I also recommend Arms for leveling because of being able to get Tactical Mastery early which makes switching stance save 25 rage. Normally changing stances makes you lose all your rage.
---
hahaha thanks bro
---
I love you
---
Well no shit it won’t work in Scholo. Demo spam is not for sustain threat on mobs with a large health pool. It’s for holding threat on nonelite mobs that hit like a wet noodle which is what I eluded to in my comment about the AoE dungeon meta. Unless it was the whelp room, then you should be fine demo/AoE to hold agro. 
---
Additionally, I use threat plates which turn red or yellow when I lose or am about to lose agro. They change color based on current target. In my dire maul north example, they stay blue the whole time and beat on me the whole time. That’s with a raid specced mage and lock without imp blizzard or using a nova and the lock hell-firing after 5 sec. So not, it’s not mobs dying in the blizzard targeting the mage. 
---
Think of it like this. If I pull 40 mobs and the healer heals me for 4,000 health over the course of that pull that means I need 100 threat per mob to hold threat or 3 demo shouts.
---
Where the fuck are you finding 5 man groups who are vetting gear lmao. I've never even seen a MC/Ony PUG with gear vetting.
---
The 95% of the community does not give a shit about you being in BiS.
---
We're not all mages and hunters you know.
---
We're in a day and age where you get looked at funny for wanting basic privacy, clearly you must be hiding something.
---
I also use an ultrawide to play WoW, you can just crop the sides (like a picture on a phone) so it renders in a format usable for sharing. The real content is all in the middle within 1920 pixels anyways so there's no real reason to include the entire screen.
---
Your chat and quest log wont show up since they're on the far right and left but you're health and frames are perfectly setup for cropping and not loosing anything important.
---
Oh yeah, and it works great for streaming too, especially since OBS lets you choose your composition to be 1080p and you can just set the ultrawide to purposely go out of the frame making for almost a seemless transition from ultrawide to normal aspect for viewers (all while you still get to play in your favorite res).
---
[Here is a picture of what i'm trying to explain, easy 1080p for all.](https://i.imgur.com/aI6NfBb.png)
---
**Edit,** i'm an idiot. I see your twitch and that's exactly why you've set it all up like that.. Haha well shit. Well if you're wondering how to post-edit already recorded ultrawide footage then you can use something like Sony Vegas (it works just like OBS, except with videos you can set "project" settings to be 1080p and overcrop the ultrawide footage from there.)
---
&gt; half of what you cried about was players doing something because of knowledge on XP
---
Reading not your strong suit? I brought up 10 man aoe farming using demo shout exploit and didn’t even go into detail about it. There’s 10+ things that have to do with Blizzard changing the game. 
---
&gt; lol bro what do you expect when you’re in a major city and people are everywhere
---
This has to do with the server tick rate, which is incredibly low. Standard tick rate for a modern MMO is at least 20, Classic WoW has 2.5. I don’t have lag problems ever, this has to do with spell batching and tick rate.
---
&gt; it doesn’t sound like you’re enjoying the game
---
Classic is classic, the game itself is phenomenal. This artificial lag makes hunters unplayable and every other class feel straight up bad to play in PvP. If you’re not PvPing, you’re either raid logging, gold farming or leveling an alt. The game is meant for world PvP otherwise the content dries up quickly. The batching is the issue.
---
I can see myself in there lol. Both layers looked like this....
---
I wasn't talking to or about you, but OK.  If you want to pay 100g a week to shave a few minutes off your time, that's great.  A guild that forces contributing members to be a cookie cutter spec in order to roll on loot regardless of their performance (in the most basic faceroll raid ever made btw) is a trash guild.
---
It's an MMO, everyone expects you to do your homework before you play. You can't just organically learn everything as we would did 15 years ago.
---
Also, let's look at the flip side. When people don't do their  homework beforehand, it can hamper the more experienced. Add this expectation to do said homwork and you have those experienced players who get pissed at players not knowing what is what.
---
I always scoff at that "Y u care how they play!?" It's an MMO... the way people play WILL hamper or help your own play.
---
The person you responded to will have to find a guild of people with no experience to avoid those with experience.
---
You're the type who would bitch at someone for not having pre-raid BiS, but shit on someone because their gear is overkill.
---
Aww man the feels! The week before this we actually got rag to 3%!! And we just couldn’t finish him. 
---
Haha love all the close call make or break moments.
---
keep it up
---
I'd say it's more than an edge, you have a huge instant heal, a 10 minute long 30 second CD fear ward, and you can break blind. 15 year old animations and you can edit your own character model if you really felt like looking at a dwarf in dragon simulator was that terrible.
---
Absolutely. You’re going to want to at least get some decent dungeon gear though if you don’t wanna get one hit.
---
[deleted]
---
You don’t seem very motivated to follow your own advice. I don’t see why others should bother if you don’t.
---
&gt; pug mc raids kill rag easily?
---
Seems like a bit of an exaggeration. I dare you to skip your guild MC next week and LFM a PUG from scratch and see how easy 10/10 is.
---
By changed I did not mean it no longer means the other but now has more meanings.  Many words have multiple definition.  By changed I meant it has a new meaning not that the old meaning is void.
---
Haha hell yeah my dude! Killer work!
---
I have this macro'd so I say it every time I close her trade window.
---
I have another for Felicia in Undercity, as well.
---
ClassicLFG Add-on lol
---
This might be a nice dps increase for the warlock but it'll lower the raid wide dps since shadowburn has higher prio than a lot of debuffs and will push them off, especially winter's chill.
---
It's scrolling text or soemthing. There is an entire tab to it.
---
proud of u
---
To be frank the game already reached that point 15 years ago.
---
Near the end of Vanilla people already had shit sorted.
---
That’s not possible. TSM can’t show you from before it was installed.
---
;)
---
Umm. Then don't follow any guides and just play? It is a 15 year old game. Even games less than a year old will be researched. Play it your way.
---
I play horde.
---
If you read, that's not what I was asking.  I know what happens when you leave a party, since the ID ownership is tied to the group owner.  Wanted to know what happens if you essentially leave an instance you are the owner of, without resetting it.
---
Lol the joke is that everyone who is "old" is a boomer, and everyone who is "young" is a millennial. Obviously actual boomers are well into their senior years and don't have 1 year old children, you weren't smart for pointing that out and the condescending "Stay in school kids" remark just makes it funnier that you didn't get it
---
I've played since vanilla, and more specifically I played a frost mage &amp; did a hell of a lot of PVP in TBC. The significance of that is something called a "shatter combo" which was a frost mage's bread &amp; butter, and it revolved entirely around batching. The server consistently "batches" (groups) actions together in waves 5 times a second (every 200 ms). If you run over a freezing trap at the correct time, you can avoid being frozen, because with the right degree of luck - you can run through the hitbox of the trap within that 200 ms window. With spells its the same thing. If I sheep you, there is still a window in which you can preform actions before the sheep has actually taken effect. This window is 200 MS. Since you're the one making the post about batching being too long at 400 MS, there is something called "the burden of proof lies with the accuser" nothing I have witnessed or seen shows it being anywhere CLOSE to 400 ms. And in the example you gave of only having 6/10th of a second to interrupt a 1s cast, that just is completly untrue. So unless you can provide a source saying otherwise.... or maybe just do a little more pvp :)
---
Everything went downhill with the launch of wrath. Wrath has far more in common with RETAIL then it does with classic
---
Yea but the higher ranks will take a while :$ would search for a good weapon if you don’t want to grind months long 15h a day
---
Yeah, just buy the bars/stones from the auction house.
---
Not what my bars looked like
---
I've also gotten songflower with groups atleast 6 times already, which also relies on batching to have multiple people get it at the same time, I'm pretty confident you haven't even attempted that yet.
---
Tailoring is definitely a recommended, in the sense that you want to get it to 300 for your truefaith vestments. (it's BIS for a long time).
---
The question is whether you want to level tailoring as you go, or pick it up at level 60 as you don't really need it until level 60. Not taking it now means you can take 2 gathering professions, or maybe something like enchanting for disenchanting gear to make a bit more bank. Skinning, Herbalism, Mining are all good money makers while levelling.
---
I myself prefer levelling professions as I level, because I enjoy it as a distraction and break from the grind.
---
But it's up to you if you prefer to level tailoring as you level, or if you want to min/max and gather as you go.
---
No just you. You just ranted about shit everyone knows about but tried to make it sound like a bigger deal than it is. You just sound miserable and should quit, that would be lovely.
---
What are you even taking damage from in MC? You want to prioritize DPS not survivability. Never thought I'd read the words that "SL is the best raiding spec"
---
You mean trying to sap from the front and breaking their own stealth over and over?
---
No it's weird and I hate it. It makes insta casts like power word shield feel clunky at times.
---
*another time*
---
Ok time to play again!
---
The campers gone. *new ganker appears*
---
Time to play another time!
---
you could probably try farming the cloth for tailoring as well. it's a solo thing too.
---
Also, maybe do some herb. farming as well if you are going to drop it.
---
Maybe level a hunter/lock as that's relatively easy.
---
Wait how? I like helping out lowbies I pass whether they're horde or alliance so being able to buff guys of the opposite faction would be sick.
---
Lol he's probably a McConnell fanboy
---
I didn't even remember that you can dismiss this way until this post. Dismiss pet is a spell after all.
---
P2 gonna be a lag fest day 1 for sure, and if you rolled a herod or faerlina like server you may not have fun at the start. But ima have fun on kromcrush gettin some pvp in
---
An opinion about a fact is literally useless. It doesn't change the fact. It's nothing to discuss even
---
Surprisingly enough, I do this for streaming but for video's they always come out like this even if I set it to 1920x1080p. I might have to start editing the videos to just include the center picture. Appreciate the tips fellow ultrawide user!
---
Yes you are.
---
this set bonus seems so powerful compared to druids...
---
Lol, exposing yourself as a bad player that isn’t good enough to see how bad the batching is. Later.
---
You can get invited to raids at 57, and take all the gear from the 60s.
---
Pugs are A-ok with that, 100%
---
You can drop some defensive debuffs to give more warlocks corruption
---
&gt; bandwagon phrases
---
Not sure you even know what that means, name one.
---
This fight will seem very hard if you do not utilize the pike in the tribute pile. You may use it once every 30 seconds to eliminate an ogre from the fight. Eventually, after about 10 ogres, Urok Doomhowl will show up, and you can kill him.
---
If you gave me a week to come up with the ugliest health/mana bars I could, I would still fall miles short of what OP has done here. That's impressively awful.
---
Yeah I wasn't being serious I followed it up with an "xD" I just figured after 2 hours SOMEONE would help. It's all good though it's not a big deal, I think a couple people who've comment thought I was being serious. Error on my part I'm sure, just bad wording.
---
can’t believe these are still coming
---
Yeah man, I’ve trolled you at least 3 or more times with that on separate occasions. Once in Wetlands, once in SM cath, then ZF. Left Skeram with my guild a few days after that ZF run.
---
&gt; but do you believe Blizzard wouldn't love people to at least play BOTH Retail and Classic?
---
And now you're moving the goalposts.
---
The original argument was that Blizzard intends for people to play classic and then "switch to retail". Which makes no sense at all; developing an entirely separate version of the game in order to attract customers to the original is insanely dumb and wasteful, and people are playing Classic specifically to AVOID retail in the first place.
---
Yeah, an addon makes it super easy and eliminates targeting them.  You can heal just as fast with your method but you are probably a little restricted on your movement while healing.  Get vuhdo or healbot and you can assign all your heals/decurses and stuff to just left click/ right click/scroll up etc. on mouse over.  You can always keep your target on the boss this way and with target of target on you can see if he switches target and you are ready then to heal that new target.
---
&gt; MC is in it’s dumbed down nerfed to all hell state.
---
Tell me where in the official patch notes does it document an MC nerf, thanks.
---
Gottem, now what? What server are you on hmm?
---
Any chance you happened to press Ctrl + V?
---
Owned again. 😂😂😂 Nice brain cell activity.
---
For just leveling, I’m still changing stances a fair bit. 
---
My typical pull, while solo, is like this:
---
Berserker Stance &gt; Berserker Rage (increases rage I get from taking damage) &gt; Battle Stance &gt; Charge (generates rage) &gt; Mortal Strike (at low levels you’d Rend and/or Sunder Armor). 
---
If the mob casts it will cast, I will switch back to Berserker to interrupt with Pummel. If the mob is living a long time or kiting me I might go back to Battle Stance to Rend. Thunderclap is Battle Stance only too, so if I feel I need that, I need to switch. Whirlwind is Berserker only, so if there are many mobs I have to switch back to Berserker Stance. Berserker Stance makes me take 10% more damage though, so I might not want to stay in Berseker. Sweeping Strikes is awesome for AOE pulls but is Battle Stance only. 
---
So yeah... this might be a lot to absorb as a new warrior. But hopefully that helps a little. There are tank scenarios where quick swapping of stances helps too.
---
No dont go brd at 51 unless ur healer and even then just why.. wait till ur atleast 54 id say. Do ST and mara from 50-54 and then go brd
---
yep
---
Becuase DKP rewards attendance and literally nothing else. The entire system is geared towards people who don't like raiding - people that are there only for the loot. They don't want holistic PvE progression for their guild, they just want that one guaranteed BiS piece after a certain number of raids.
---
Yes I was just relating to me having no downtime during casts on different people.
---
. (Start)Cast heal on tank and then target dps and spam click heal while the heal is still going off to heal dps right after. No downtime. 
---
Sorry for he bad wording my man. 
---
WAIT, your saying even with mouse over macros this is not possible to switch witch target your spell heals?!? I thought that was the point of them so I just thought it was super frustrating and left it lol
---
Want shorter queues? Roll alliance :3
---
I wouldn't
---
I do find this funny!
---
Pro tip, thanks man. Will try it out, sounds awesome.
---
Ahh okay thank you!
---
So I have this macro:
---
#showtooltip Defensive Stance
---
/equip Windstorm Hammer
---
/equip Heart of Agamaggan
---
/cast Defensive Stance
---
/cast Bloodrage
---
/cast Shield Bash
---
which works perfectly fine, it casts bloodrage then shield bashes. I want to do the same thing with Pummel and Berserker stance but the macro isn't working. Anyone have any ideas?
---
&gt;The entire experience feels formulaic and trite. Everyone seems to overgear everything. There's barely any challenge at all. Hell, at least retail has mythic content. In classic its just a bunch of people with a bunch of BiS gear slaughtering the content with ease.
---
Raid content is pretty easy at any level of classic or retail. MC and Ony is really just prep for PvP. Good luck getting HWL with ease.
---
Also, more min/maxing means less time wasted in raid. If you need two raid nights to clear MC and Ony, that's fine, but some people have other stuff they want to do.
---
Just put on a shield, if you are having trouble with aggro you are either not in def stance or not utilizing your threat generating abilities. 2h tank is a thing when you are overgeared and know what you are doing with atleast a competent healer if not a premade party. It is not meant to be done by newbies running pugs.
---
He does get it but dismisses the nonsense and tells someone who probably is still in high school to stay in school.  Not that hard to follow.
---
I'm at level 58 on Alliance and running out of quests to do to finish getting to 60. Seems like all the PUGs I see recruiting for scholo, BRD, etc. only want you to join if you're level 60 already. What dungeons can I run from 58.5 -&gt; 60 to finish leveling that people will actually let me join?
---
Even still 3 spawn ever so many seconds. It’s a tough tough fight and the ogres hit so hard
---
Yikes, you need therapy. Never seen one this delusional and triggered.
---
Wait but doesn't your health and mana reset to full as soon as you level up?
---
or did you die and level at such an exact moment that you never got the health returned?
---
That was epic either way lol.
---
Definitely helps a lot in explaining it.. makes me even more scared to play warrior now though so I kinda wish you just left me alone 😁😉
---
For real tho, thanks
---
See ya in naxx ;) Also no one is going 100% afli, gotta get Ruin.
---
Agreed, wrath was the beginning of the end
---
Wont tell me the server you play on?
---
Advise:  Get a warrior to 20 and tank a dungeon 5-10 times to see if you like the class.
---
Imo, WoW Classic Warrior is the worst tank I've ever played in 20 years of gaming and ive played 20+ mmorpg games.
---
Same, not really hard to beat the average.
---
The one that isn't Holy or Dicipline.
---
DMN trash is much harder than any of the other dungeons.  
---
If you don't CC on the 4 pulls or deal with the fearing mobs properly you will wipe unless you are raid BIS.
---
Other dungeons it's much easier to salvage bad or double pulls.
---
Remember that horde guy that just walked past you and went on his way to farm/quest? Now he has a reason to kill you. You will he hunted, dungeon entrances will be camped, you will corpse run a lot. Flight masters will be camped, prepare to die as soon as you arrive to eastern and western plague lands.
---
Yo man! I don’t like spammers either. I got quite a lot of viewers tonight though and they were entertained for the most part. Like the other person said this is the first stream post I’ve posted here since joining a couple of months ago. You can’t expect someone to never advertise something they’re trying to grow. Spamming I agree is crossing the line between being honest and just advertising your entertainment and being a polluter and flooding the forum. Anyways I understand your opinion but I think I’m being reasonable. Otherwise just ignore the post, downvote if you’d like and look for content you want to see and upvote that.

Let people enjoy their lives how they want to lol

Can you make a video?
---
How’d did u 3 man the bond pile Urok?
---
Wouldn't the fact more people know the fights because it was in WOTLK make a difference or are the gear requirements still very strict that it won't matter?
---
Yo why is dwarf priest good?
---
Agreed - I’m a WoW noob and wish there was a server that was dedicated to new players.
---
I got screamed at for Needing on a blue sword in Maradaun the other day because it’s apparently BIS for mages. I’m a rogue and the dps on that sword was WAY higher than the dagger I had equipped, so I thought needing was a no-brainer despite 1% spell crit not being useful to me.
---
I have absolutely no idea why the BIS mage item would be a level ~45 sword(!) that has high dps - afaik mages don’t melee - but apparently everyone knows all the BIS’s and if you don’t you’re an ahole.
---
I tried to apologize to him after other group members explained it to me, but he had left the group and blocked me. Sucks cuz we couldn’t finish the dungeon run with 4 so had to disband before killing princess.

Reminder that the community ***very specifically*** asked for
---
And I quote
---
NO CHANGES
---
You asked for this. You voted for this by playing classic. Bringing this up 2 weeks before it goes live, and after classic launched, is way too God damn late.
---
It's kinda funny, as an oceanic player I never ever noticed this spell batching back in Vanilla. It was mostly imperceptible, either the lag ate that time window up or we chalked any spell batching shenanigans up as just lag. 
---
Now that we have ACTUAL oceanic servers we are playing at 11 ms as opposed to the 400 ms on a good day. So this spell batching was inperceptible, but in classic now I can see it.
---
Im also noticing somtimes if im casting really fast, it feels like sometimes the next cast feels like it's halving the cast time. Like there's a spell haste proc but not really. Not sure if that's spell batching or just playing with sub triple digit ms.
---
cringe
---
Let me break it down since you’re missing the point. First I have an addon that shows when a target change happens in real time. I can see when agro is lost. 
---
Berserker rage -&gt; Battle stance -&gt; Charge -&gt; Defensive stance -&gt; Bloodrage -&gt; demoshout &gt; excess rage cleave/tab melee. 
---
Each demo shout causes 55 (43 * 1.25 multiplier) threat with defiance and defensive stance. You do that 5 times which equals 275 threat. At which point your dps starts to AoE. By the time this is complete you’ll have had 3 swings or cleave go out which means at least 5-6 mobs have &gt;500 threat combined ignoring the threat effect of Brage/zrage. You continue this and don’t lose agro because the dps AoE ticks can’t  overcome the threat lead by the time the mobs die. 
---
Say you have 2 AoE dps, each mob has 1200 health. Each hellfire tics for 150 and each blizzard tics for 170. (I don’t know the exact damage value). This means it would take the lock 6 tics to overcome your initial threat lead, because you’ll get another 3 demos off (bringing your lead to 655) in that time along with more cleaves/autos. Add into that the 25-40 threat per block from the shield spike, which at 18.37% block is pretty often. 
---
It is true if the mob had more health I would lose agro with this method, but I’m mathematically causing just barely enough threat to hold agro on everything.
---
Wait, what? How does he prove your point in any way?
---
Your first point was that it was boring that all players minmaxed and looked exactly the same.
---
Then you pivoted to it being about people being sidelined in raids for having slighly worse than BiS gear, by a tiny margin, which you now have conceded to be false.
---
Now you are instead arguing that you won't be able to join the top guilds when you are running around in barely preraid BiS gear.
---
I'm genuinely trying to understand - What is your point here? What's the goal? How would you go about measuring the "experience" that you value so much, and how would the guilds know? Again, I am genuinely curious here.
---
Everyone ive seen who says he inspired them has been a deadbeat. Not one of them has actually achieved anything in life. 
---
Loser inspired other losers. Yeah dont give a shit. He was an idiot. Imagine dying to something so pathetic.
---
I would out DPS a affliction warlock as deep frost spec. And not respeccing every week for raid doesn’t make you bad, it makes you dumb cuz it’s a waste of gold. Unless your guild requires you to respec or you want to do more damage it’s not necessary. None of our mages respec for raid and we full clear each week in under 3 hours no problem.
---
Gear and consumes and management of those consumes is what puts you ahead in naxx.
---
Am a tank on whitemain alliance. I do whatever dungeon I want, when I want. I just spam /4 for a few mins. Don't try to join a group, make one yourself. I don't think I've ever spent much more then 5 mins looking. I don't know what else to tell you.
---
The challenge is things like hoping 40 people will show up for raid, or explaining to the warlocks why they shouldn’t roll need on +healing gear.
---
I solo grind whole levels IN one spot too and stay away from cleave grips 🤪
---
Make it where.  Stop talking like an idiot..fucking hell
---
It's geared towards getting people to show up for raid and on time. I don't care if you're the best mage in the world, someone else who is present is doing more damage than you are when you didn't log in.    
---
   
---
&gt;They don't want holistic PvE progression for their guild, they just want that one guaranteed BiS piece after a certain number of raids.  
---
You have to kill bosses to get their loot. They can't get the best pieces if they aren't killing all the bosses. Frankly I don't give a shit what someone's "motivation" is, I just want them there and on time.
---
Holy fuck this is awesome. What is the level 6 meta like? I was thinking warlock would be awesome but you don't get fear till level 8.
---
Yes 100%. I did it in vanilla while leveling up as well. I was max reputation for all BGs before hitting 60 and managed to get to rank 11(?) before BC came out. I was definitely late to the party in vanilla but i was able to hold my own against the Nax and AQ geared people (feral Druid)
---
I never once did a raid or any dungeon past ZF. 100% pvp gear from reputation rewards and rank rewards the entire way to 60.
---
I really don’t understand what you mean by bad in dungeons? I feel like I could do any dungeon with 0 points spent. If you don’t care about topping the meter, see if you can be the winter’s chill mage for balanced raid/farm/pvp.
---
You definitely won’t get high overlord even if you get rank 14...
---
So he needs to stay in school because the other guy didn't like the joke he made and considers it "nonsense"?
---
Lmao sounds like he needs to get the fuck over himself then
---
Smh
---
Lots of farming and world buffs, the other thing will be when is naxx coming out? I wouldn't be surprised if the classic playerbase died off quite a bit before naxx
---
Krol and Assassination Blade tmk for swords are both fine.
---
did you fall for the warrior staff meme?
---
Do the server a favor and join one that is alliance heavy.
---
I had a lvl 60 horde character one shot me at the exact moment my hearthstone finished casting. My ghost was in Ironforge (my hearth) and my corpse was in Arathi where I got ganked.
---
&gt;What are your thoughts on Phase 2?
---
I can't wait for the bloodbath. 
---
I don't play WoW to beat some trivial PvE encounters that have been farmed for 10+ years, I'm here to struggle fighting against the biggest and best nerds WoW has to offer.
---
I didn't actually read your post because I don't have to. The fact that you're asking the question at all means yes, you did make a mistake by rolling on a pvp. It's not for you.
---
On a PvP server, definitely the Rogue.
---
For PvE, probably the mage if you do it really efficiently... But it would be a pretty mind numbing grind.
---
Thanks for your input - I’m glad I informed you of the vendor price, but if you think I get mad over things on the internet you’re as naive as you sound
---
Any counters to the dick level 60 mage Frostafari on Kromcrush sitting where guards can’t get to him in Gadgetzan? 
---
He’s been killing people passing by for hours daily, and not a single 60 Alliance does anything.
---
This is an absolute LIE LMFAO.
---
This is hilarious. If actually did this it would mean you found a way to rebug demo shout, which you didn't because it's fixed.

Thanks for your input hours after this post was made, very constructive mantis, I’m sorry if I ruined your attempts to gouge bud

made a new rogue and got to 60 in three days? again?
---
now hes posting the same question hourly.
---
Sorry to tell people about another one of your super smart money making secrets :,(
---
the way demo shout was bugged was it was multiplying the threat (43 * 1.25* the number of targets). Now it’s just a flat 43*1.25
---
All the theorycrafting has reported this. Ever read the forums or the fight club theorycrafting discord?
---
I mean, I've been playing vanilla for the past 10 years on private servers... Probably going to keep playing classic for the next 30 years or so.
---
*sigh* What am I doing with my life...
---
When it resets, you can start it again after you abandon it. Maybe try logging after you abandon it
---
Thank you for complimenting the size of my brain though it means a lot I love being recognized for my talents
---
That’s hilarious hhahahaa
---
As a warrior trying to grind out my first 1k gold, I'm buying lionheart first. It's BiS for all foreseeable content, and it's a good feeling to have that squared away. As a dps warrior, I'm tired of wearing leather in nearly as many slots as rogues. I'm so damn squishy. Any slot where I can go plate and not lose any dps I absolutely will at any cost. Lionheart all day every day.
---
The only time I would recommend going mount first is if your gold income is primarily from farming ore/herb nodes. A faster mount will increase your farm rate in that context.
---
&gt;This has to do with the server tick rate, which is incredibly low. Standard tick rate for a modern MMO is at least 20, Classic WoW has 2.5. I don’t have lag problems ever, this has to do with spell batching and tick rate.
---
No it has nothing to do with tick rate. Tick rate is simply the rate at which you get updates from the server. The server could be processing events as soon as they are received and could still have a low tick rate. Tick rate and spell batching are separate issues. The issue with other players rubberbanding in cities is due to server capacity limitations, ie the server isn't giving accurate updates because it is overloaded. Increasing the tick rate without using better hardware would only make the rubberbanding worse.
---
&gt;Classic is classic, the game itself is phenomenal. This artificial lag makes hunters unplayable and every other class feel straight up bad to play in PvP. If you’re not PvPing, you’re either raid logging, gold farming or leveling an alt. The game is meant for world PvP otherwise the content dries up quickly. The batching is the issue.
---
And the spell batching is as it is because that was part of the PVP game during vanilla and mastering it was what good PVPers did.
---
i abandon and am restarting, hopefully not a fail, so much time wasted doing it twice
---
I would look into submitting a ticket and getting that sub-optimal choice fixed.
---
I bought stuff for gold also.  We're like twins.
---
Tab sunder = carpal tunnel, I agree I had a warrior and rogue tank in RIFt. Rogue tanking was the most fun I’ve had.
---
4 mins on the epic mount is actually about 6 mins and 40 seconds on a regular mount
---
Yeah, cause looking at raid kills from vanilla and everyone looks different there right?
---
your turn for a source on 400.

---
You are so incorrect about spell batching that it hurts. They had to recreate the 200ms window that existed in vanilla WoW due to bad servers by implementing spell batching because there are unique vanilla mechanics that existed because of spell batching, famously things like vanishing spells, both warriors charging eachother at the same time, or two mages polying eachother at the same time....You gotta chill at some point babe, and realize that no one is a bootlicker, they just arent whiny ass bitches like you.

---
Are you friendly to the Frostmane trolls in the area? I imagine a gnome must attack you first to be flagged for pvp.
---
&gt;Let me break it down since you’re missing the point. First I have an addon that shows when a target change happens in real time. I can see when agro is lost. 
---
Considering it's been pointed out to you by multiple people this doesn't work, it's you that isn't getting this...
---
&gt;Berserker rage -&gt; Battle stance -&gt; Charge -&gt; Defensive stance -&gt; Bloodrage -&gt; demoshout &gt;excess rage cleave/tab melee. 
---
Straight up, if you're using a slow wep, 
---
Charge &gt; zerker/zerker &gt; whirlwind &gt; dstance &gt; demo.
---
Way better at snap threat, 
---
&gt;Each demo shout causes 55 (43 * 1.25 multiplier) threat with defiance and defensive stance. You do that 5 times which equals 275 threat. At which point your dps starts to AoE. By the time this is complete you’ll have had 3 swings or cleave go out which means at least 5-6 mobs have &gt;500 threat combined ignoring the threat effect of Brage/zrage. You continue this and don’t lose agro because the dps AoE ticks can’t  overcome the threat lead by the time the mobs die. 
---
5 uses of demo shout is 7.5 seconds. Mobs hit for atleast 50dmg per swing roughly every gcd,  you're saying 6 x 50avg = 300 x 5 = 1500 that you need to be healed for. And you just spent 8 seconds doing nothing.
---
Dps waiting to AoE? What is this vanilla? Lmao. Sheltered life is sheltered.
---
&gt;Say you have 2 AoE dps, each mob has 1200 health. Each hellfire tics for 150 and each blizzard tics for 170. (I don’t know the exact damage value). This means it would take the lock 6 tics to overcome your initial threat lead, because you’ll get another 3 demos off (bringing your lead to 655) in that time along with more cleaves/autos. Add into that the 25-40 threat per block from the shield spike, which at 18.37% block is pretty often. 
---
Non elites mobs have minimum 4k hp. 
---
Blizzard ticks for 99 per hit at like level 45. Blizzard also doesn't usually pull threat. It's when CoChits for 800 crits for 1500 that you'll lose any semblance of threat you demo'd into the mob.
---
&gt;It is true if the mob had more health I would lose agro with this method, but I’m mathematically causing just barely enough threat to hold agro on everything.
---
Which is why you're wrong. Because the question has never been "how do i hold  aggro on 10 non-elites for 2 seconds"
---
It was about managing AoE threat. Why the fuck would someone ask about pulls that are 1% of your AoE tanking experiences in classic.
---
Hm, maybe in a future content, Blizzard can find a way to introduced the exclusive class to the other faction.
---
SS &gt; Whirlwind is two globals and will get solid threat on four mobs. To sunder them all requires four globals even if you have the rage which you probably won't. I don't believe you are regularly running with DPS that wait four globals before dropping AOE on a four mob pack.
---
I played a lock all though BC. My damage was only limited by the tank's threat. In 5 mans my guild made me take off my robe and pants because my crit was just too high, so even if I saw an SB crit and stopped firing, 2-3 more were in the air and they'd often crit too. So I was my guild's famous naked warlock.
---
So why's it called OMEGA? Your comment comes off as you begging for someone to ask lol.
---
I think this is the biggest advantage for classic+ in the ‘tbc vs classic+‘ debate. If we get tbc, there will be bis guides and everything will be as formulaic as classic upon release. But classic+ has opportunity for new stuff.
---
Also always thought ribcage but I can see spider too.
---
&gt;Been tanking a long time now.
---
So have I.
---
&gt;Was doing 2 hand up until a halfway mark in BRD where the second half of the dungeon I'd need a shield or heals couldn't keep me up.
---
You were running with bad healers.
---
&gt;Actually have way more aggro now than I did using a 2 hander...
---
You don't know how to 2 hand tank then. Prot cannot produce more threat in the initial few globals than 2 hand Arms. There was a reason the old rule was "wait for three sunders".
---
&gt;and yes, I knew how to open up and pull a good rotation.
---
What was it then?
---
&gt;Never have a problem with dps in a pack... they may pick up a few non elite stragglers, but tab sunders / shouts / with the right talents have you on top.
---
And if you did 2 hand tanking correctly you'd not have to do that. A shout is also not getting aggro back except maybe from a healer doing a light heal. 
---
&gt;The comment is correct above you about waiting to be overgeared before going back to two weapons or a two hander and fury spec.
---
Nope. The extra mitigation from a shield simply does not matter in dungeons unless the healer is going OOM 80% through the fight. And the main reason healers OOM is having to heal DPS who've pulled off the tank. Any good 2h tank has a macro that switches to 1h/shield and has all their shield based abilities macro'd to switch to a shield when pressed anyway. If incoming damage is going to be high they just press their swap macro after grabbing initial threat with a 2 hander.
---
Also even if you were right about it being due to people being overgeared then that is a description of end game dungeon farming. If you are 60 and running UBRS/scholo/strath then you can expect most people to at least be in partial pre-raid BIS. Which means the tank needs a high threat build like 2h Arms.
---
abandon and redo work...idk why they didnt fix this bug saw same problem on a 2006 post on wowhead
---
Anything more than 1 mob where players use an ***Area of Effect*** ability is an AoE pull.
---
No shit healing is split. So is demo shout. So unless somehow you take less than 50dmg per gcd per mob. Demo spam isn't going to work.
---
Not a single person wants to know how to tank non-elites, the dps can tank them themselves ffs.
---
My first guild ever did blind bidding and it was the *absolute worst* because I would consistently get outbid by 1-3 points by the loot master's buddies. Didn't take long to figure out wtf was going on.
---
Sort of. There's a base no RNG list, a list of Essences, a list of Azerite powers you want sure and a list of stat weighs.  
---
Then you have War/Titanforging, sockets being rng, and so on. Then you gotta run it through the simulator to see what's best. It's less RNG now since Azerite cannot forge or get sockets and weapons cannot Titanforge but still, you have a pretty good idea what your bis is but if any of that RNG gets rolled, sim it.
---
wristguards of stability?
---
Threat issues didn’t exist in Vanilla?
---
Demoshout isn’t split ya idjit. Battleshout is. It’s flat threat to everything hit. See the 2nd most upvoted comment on this thread or fight club for confirmation.
---
My original comment was &gt;6 packs. So why the fuck were you arguing with me in the first place about it then? 
---
AOE is for packs of &gt;5 or your just wasting mana.
---
Is that unusual? I am new to WoW and was given a screenshot to draw this persons character from
---
&gt;Every single top Vanilla PvPer says the batching is horribly inaccurate.
---
It is. But not because it exists.
---
&gt;You clearly didn’t play Vanilla back in 2004-2007.
---
I did. Which is why I actually want to play something as close to vanilla as possible and not just vanilla themed retail like you do.
---
Ah yes comical
---
Honestly, I regret not rolling on it. But friends didn't want to roll on it because of being "rp". I guess  they are vetter off without us.
---
So you are a liar? As you just made another reply to me claiming the issue was the batching isn't accurate. Batching and low tick rate was the vanilla experience. If you want to be a vanilla purist you complain about how well classic is emulating vanilla batching but not that exists.
---
Is it just me or does this resemble Thanos just a bit?
---
tbh im jealous of his ability to do things like this without feeling humiliated
---
Oh, now you’re saying I don’t like the existence of spell batching, and not that it’s wildly inaccurate. 
---
Another one bites the dust.
---
I was wrong...my bad, remembered it incorrectly, TY for letting me know though, glad to know I was wrong actually haha
---
My guild has GuildnameDPS, GuildnameTank, GuildnameHealer as role channels to communicate role-specific stuff in raids
---
The boss then proceeds to die so quickly healers spend less mana anyway.
---
What you said doesn't make any sense, there's no connection between begin good at the game and not taking damage as a tank. Tanking is about staying alive and keeping aggro while the boss dies as fast as possible, it always has been.
---
Sounds great to miss that part.
---
Sure but thats because of titanforging. But you kneo your bis list and you know the best version of those items will be the BiS regardless of other items titanforging. Problem is that you probably will get other items titanforged in some slots. Doesnt change the fact that if your BiS item also titanforgen then its bis. People in retail are alos chasing specific pieces for every slot. Doesnt mean they will equip the base version sure, but it still means that that item with item level X is better than any other item with itemlevel X. You wont be chasing other items in hopes that they titanforge and be better than your bis ring that you have. Instead you keep chasing the same ring in hopes that it titanforges.
---
What class are you?
---
Tauren war, full sm gear with ravager
---
Yes, I’m aware because of this post and others that the majority of players are bootlicking sycophants and terrible PvPers. Spell batching will remain as it is, for the entirety of the game (not much longer with the accelerated timeline). Hopefully they care about PvP when PvP has relevance in TBC/WotLK.
---
STV/Feralas/Tanaris/Hinterlands
---
No one area will get you the levels you need, you will have to chop and change areas doing quests as they come to you, otherwise just farm mobs
---
Decolace, finish stv, grind sm cath till 43 then hop in zf, arathi highlands, alterac mountains, dust wallow marsh... lots of options dude
---
Get to 60 before Phase 2
---
Made me lol pretty hard.
---
No my wife is looking at me like “Succession isn’t that funny”.
---
Why would you disable this? Its usefull to know if a priest is PI or holy, or if a war tank is fury or prot.
---
&gt;It's also 55 rage split between two stance.
---
Charge+bloodrage and initial weapon hit gets you enough to SS, stance change is on its own cooldown, then mob hits should give you enough rage for whirlwind.
---
&gt;Prot spec can still use WW. 
---
You saying that tells me you don't actually understand how SS &gt; whirlwind/cleave works. The hits from whirlwind/cleave trigger SS hits. Nothing beats that for snap threat on four to six mobs. If the incoming damage as high you can then swap to 1h/shield and keep cleave/revenge up to maintain the aggro easily.
---
People are way over reacting. Will you get ganked more than you do now while leveling? Probably. Will it make leveling unbearable? Unlikely. It’ll probably be pretty bad right when Phase 2 drops but I’m guessing after a couple weeks it’ll settle.
---
I leveled in vanilla during the time where the honor system was released and before BGs. I fondly remembered the gank squads I ran into. But I was able to still level to 60 just fine. You’re on a PVP server, the possibility of getting ganked is something you signed up for.
---
Yes please

I dont disagree with the core of what your saying but the only thing keeping bots like this one safe is security by obscurity.  As soon as a human views their actions they are outed.  All my idea wld do is prevent them hiding amoungst the masses really.
---
It depends. One of the things that classic brought is a new start and a fresh economy. Unlike expansions where gold carry over. If blizzard had servers that would open fresh in batches like every 6-12 months it would last very long as can be seen in the private server scene
---
If you want that little gnomes soul you gotta pay the troll toll.
---
My hunter is only in his 40s but I've used a bow as fast as 1.9 and it wasnt bad. Just keep upgrading your quiver so you can carry more arrows around.
---
I really wonder how Blizz is going to balance phase 2. Back in Vanilla, you generally behave because if you camped someone too much they'll call general chat to help them sort you out. But on servers with severe faction imbalance like Skeram, Alliance has nobody to call on. 
---
Maybe the remaining Alliance transferring off the server will finally make the toxic horde campers realise that they caused their own server's death.
---
Mate, being DS/Ruin and just sacrificing the Voidhunter for dungeons and farming is the most relaxing thing ever. I love autopiloting.

Nah.  That's nowhere near as bad as old healbot and 1 button DPS rotation macros lol

What's super sad is that you are ignoring the incredibly positive influence Zyzz had on many young men riddled with self-esteem and confidence issues and instead focusing on his use of drugs, as though using drugs makes you an instant idiot and someone who should be disregarded as such. Get the stick out of your ass.

Came across a level 18 prot warrior grinding gators in Loch Modan, constantly dying.

Came across him like 5 days later, at level 21. Still constantly dying.

Although certain aspects of the game are drilled into players heads through guides and YouTube videos, like BiS gear and farming items like Devilsaur Leather, or elemental Fire, these are aspects of the game that get very much attention but for the most part aren’t that important. I think that you should just play the game, get whatever gear is an upgrade for you, and you’ll still be fine. What I do to make money is simply focus on a few items on the auction house and have an average price that I always buyout below... let’s say youre buying thorium bars and you buy anything below 30silver, then when the price goes up you sell at 40 silver. You’ll always make money because you’ve chosen an item that’s a necessity/ in high demand for many players, and once you’ve established a large enough inventory you’ll have a constant money flow greater than the initial investment over time
---
Hey guys, so I am a 60 hunter and would like to know what are some of the best mobs to grind at 60 for gold towards my epic mount? Got a few TV shows to catch up on so would love to just grind mobs while I do that! Thanks guys
---
So many tryhard comments in this thread.
---
I know exactly how it works I played it from 40 &gt; 55.
---
It doesn't invalidate prot. You're trying to say it's this or nothing. I literally said you're 100% fine as prot holding aggro.
---
What you don't seem to understand is in the time it takes you to build rage for WW you could easily already lose 2 mobs. You charge zerker / zerker WW, you have 4 mobs on you and on your zerker rage straight away. Then you're tab sundering / cleaving as per usual, you just take way less initial damage.
---
What professions do you have?
---
idiot - fine
---
dipshit - OOFIES BIG CRINGE XD
---
Details has a threat plugin.
---
Okay?
---
lol wtf have you done any MC?
---
FYI - you conjure water = 2* (level you are - level you got new rank).
---
So if I just got new water, I can conjure like 10 per mana bar. If I got it a few levels ago, I’ll fill your inventory if you want off 2 bars.
---
That’s why sometimes we seem super generous or stingy.
---
Ahhh, yea it is. It used to be combined threat, aka, why AoE leveling worked. And now it's not. So the threat that you're using yo calculate is split between the mobs it hits.
---
Sure you can demo 6 mobs for 500 threat, but it's not 500 threat per mob. Same as healing it's not 1500 threat per mob, it's split.
---
So if you're doing a total of 500threat but you're losing 1000 hp, you're behind the 8ball.
---
Blizzard is dps efficient at 3 mobs.
---
Yeah same boat, also interested in some good mindless farms for epic mount money.
---
Because that’s where she came from...  That’s what the kids are calling it these days right?
---
You should only expect a hot right before or after healing the tank though, so the healer can keep the 5 second rule as much as possible. There is a cost to dropping heals, even hots, w/o clustering them and timing them all.
---
I blame Blizzard more than anyone on the Horde side.

If you were actually good enough to farm all that gold and blow it on dungeon runs of all things, you probably wouldn’t be in a situation where you need to buy dungeon runs in the first place. At least don’t make your post scream “I bought all of my gold” if you need to ask these questions.
---
Well you dont with that kind of deficit. But even on horde dominated servers some alliances crew will be very hard to take on. Basically you can negate a bit of the downside by being the dominant faction, but even then youll be food for any serious guy on the weaker one.
---
There is a war going on, you must fight
---
DPS wasn’t nearly as high as it currently is. Also each pull had CC and Tanks weren’t really expected to have more than 2 mobs at once.
---
I have a 60 Warrior and tanked from lvl 18 wailing caverns onwards. Dungeons usually do fill up right away, I just post LF 1heals/3dps WC (for example) and then update it and post again as people join to show that the group is actually forming. Go arms for tactical mastery and use 2handed weapons, you can tank very well and be top Dps most of the time. I had a 1h and shield for the odd hard hitting boss but otherwise only used 2h. I’ve always used stance dance macros 
---
Battle stance-charge 
---
Battle stance - execute 
---
Battle stance - mocking blow 
---
Battle stance -thunderclap 
---
Defensive stance - taunt 
---
Berserker stance - whirlwind 
---
Etc
---
From my experience fury isn’t good until endgame when you have a lot of hit% gear. And playing warrior without tactical mastery is just not very fun in my opinion. Any more questions go ahead, feel like I know the ins and outs
---
My guildy just recently got banned for huge amounts of gold trading and the guy didn’t pay him back they’re both banned for 6 weeks watch out bruh
---
Download "Details!" It's similar to recount as a damage meter, but has threat meter as well.

I use the threat meter plugin from it, and use recount as the damage meter cos I can't seem to use details very well for the damage meter side of things

To be fair, that’s like every dps’s secondary role, pull threat from the healer and tank/kite it.
---
I’m always keeping an eye on the healer to Frost Nova, pull threat.

---
A typical mouseover macro would look like this:
---
    #showtooltip
---
    /cast [@mouseover,help][] Heal
---
This type of mouseover macro works as follows:
---
-	if you have a friendly unit under your mouse, cast Heal at them
---
-	if you don’t have a friendly mouseover, use normal casting rules, which would either heal your target, if they are friendly, or heal you if your target isn’t friendly or if you don’t have one. 
---
Important note, you can mouseover the player in the game world, name plate, or their unit frame in your party or raid frames. Obviously, party/raid frames would be the way to go 99% of the time.

Maybe it’s a gear thing. I’m definitely not losing agro to healers with demo shout on those big packs, and I’ve had my healers remark I take 0 damage. I think I’m at 45% avoidance or something absurd at this point and still not having threat issues. 
---
Blizzard damage is efficient at 3 mobs, but having the mage drink every pull isn’t. The group would collectively move faster if you either single target on 3 mob packs, or pull 6 to squeeze out the most efficiency out of your mage.
---
&gt; That in reality will make zero different compared to spending time mastering game mechanics and becoming a better player.
---
yeah that's just...not true lmao
---
Ehhhh I'd say it's the healer's job to prevent the group from wiping.
---
Some DPS are key to keep alive. Mages on aoe pulls, melee DPS in extended fights/panic pulls. There are times where letting the tank die is actually the best course of events (usually deep prot tanks who can't contribute to dps while a warrior DPS will hold aggro well enough but do x3 the damage).
---
Very situational, depending on gearing/skill/class of the group honestly.
---
&gt;It doesn't invalidate prot. 
---
I didn't say it did.
---
&gt;You're trying to say it's this or nothing.
---
No. That was the person I first replied to that said you had to out gear content to do 2 hand Arms or Fury tanking and didn't even know how the defensive stance threat bonus more than makes up for the DPS decrease.
---
&gt;I literally said you're 100% fine as prot holding aggro.
---
Yes, and I said nothing beats 2 hand arms for initial aggro on the typical dungeon pack. If you are playing with DPS who wait long enough for prot to grab aggro then you won't have an issue. However in my experience the typical pug players start DPSing before the tank has even finished their first global. 2 hand arms also has the bonus of actually dealing damage instead of potential damage in the form of sunders.
---
&gt;What you don't seem to understand is in the time it takes you to build rage for WW you could easily already lose 2 mobs.
---
If the DPS are going AOE that earlier than prot doesn't stand a chance either. SS &gt; whirlwind will also snap aggro back even if the DPS grabbed it with their first AOE.
---
&gt;You charge zerker / zerker WW, you have 4 mobs on you and on your zerker rage straight away. Then you're tab sundering / cleaving as per usual, you just take way less initial damage.
---
Less damage means less rage, which means less threat. There isn't a single-pack pull in a dungeon where a warrior tank will die in three globals so the time spent using a 2 hander to SS&gt;whirlwind isn't an issue. Idiot DPS warriors trying to tank die because they are wearing too much leather and pull too much.
---
Do you play on a pvp server? If so, I think it's going to be paramount to have an epic mount by phase 2. Otherwise you might just be chased down constantly. 
---
If you play on pve, then helm is prob fine to get first.
---
Healers/tanks can run dungeons for quite a bit of passive gold.  I bought my epic mount on my druid purely through grinding pre-bis. Every other class has ways to farm very efficiently inside of dungeons.
---
Nah I never used a staff
---
U really think a GM would do that?
---
I was doing less damage because I'm stupid. I stared at my gear, hovered over it to make sure something weird didn't happen, but I never hovered over my dagger, cuz, well, dagger.
---
It was my skinning dagger instead of my Hypnotic Blade.  derp.
---

Since I hit 52 I have kept my flag on 24/7 on a PvE server.  I get attacked by people who want to PvP and I get essentially the same experience as I would on a PvP server except generally tamer.  I almost never picked any fights when I was on a PvP server anyway.
---
Pretty sure you’re not supposed to shadowburn bosses until the last hit.. I’ve looked at too parses for warlocks and they aren’t using SB more than once or twice on a fight
---
6% for boss mobs, 5.5% for dungeon bosses, 5% for 61 mobs, 4.5% for 60 mobs
---
Weapon skill mostly just prevents the boss levels from jumping by 3%. You still want most of your hit in dungeons.
---
&gt;No. That was the person I first replied to that said you had to out gear content to do 2 hand Arms or Fury tanking and didn't even know how the defensive stance threat bonus more than makes up for the DPS decrease.
---
If you're a normal person you do. Average healers are that good.
---
&gt;Yes, and I said nothing beats 2 hand arms for initial aggro on the typical dungeon pack. If you are playing with DPS who wait long enough for prot to grab aggro then you won't have an issue. However in my experience the typical pug players start DPSing before the tank has even finished their first global. 2 hand arms also has the bonus of actually dealing damage instead of potential damage in the form of sunders.
---
Initial threat doesn't really mean much if you can only do it once a minute.
---
&gt;If the DPS are going AOE that earlier than prot doesn't stand a chance either. SS &gt; whirlwind will also snap aggro back even if the DPS grabbed it with their first AOE.
---
Never had an issue with threat as prot, even when they are casting blizzard as you charge.
---
&gt;Less damage means less rage, which means less threat. There isn't a single-pack pull in a dungeon where a warrior tank will die in three globals so the time spent using a 2 hander to SS&gt;whirlwind isn't an issue. Idiot DPS warriors trying to tank die because they are wearing too much leather and pull too much.
---
Literally 2nd pull in lbrs without CC when using a 2h you can die in 3 gcd. Hopefully your healer isn't that brain dead, but I can easily happen.
---
And idiot for warriors is why the 2h tank meta is hated so much.
---
It’s simple. A healer heals a warlock as long as they are not compromising the tanks healing for that encounter. Also to take into account is that it’s fine if the warlock is on half health when the engagement ends. That way he can eat+drink it up while you drink yourself. Spending mana to top him off is of no value at the end. 
---
I always try to convince the warlock to be close enough to tank to be able to chain heal him instead as it’s way more efficient.
---
Hurricane is my favorite weapon in the game for Hunters. I used it all the way to 60, and still use it every day as a farming bow. The proc goes off all the time, your individual shots deal less damage, but you shoot a lot faster.
---
It's actually amazing because your pet has more chance to get aggro, and even your big crits are not big enough to pull mobs from your pet. +7 Damage Scope on a fast bow means you get more out the scope, because you're shooting faster. You also feel great using it because you're shooting most of the time, and not waiting.
---
If you have high crit chance, you also get more out of your crits, because you're shooting faster. lol  
---
Just always carry a full quiver of arrows and you're fine. Reload after dungeons and you're never going to run out of arrows.
---
Final thing is that "little" damage matters as much as "big damage" from slow crossbows. If you're farming mobs that are lower level, you're usually overkilling them with a slow crossbow, with Hurricane it's always optimal.
---
I have a feeling that people who complain about the speed never tried it that much.I love it and it's always in my bag. :)Slow Crossbow for Raids and Dungeons.Hurricane for everything else.
---
Right, but you can't count on Titanforging even when farming. It's a whole lotta luck since mythic raid clears are once a week, and your weekly m+ chest is 1 item. Ideally you want titanforge + socket of every item on that base bis list but you're better off winning the lottery than ever seeing it. So you get other, non-bis titanforges and sockets that you have to sim to see if its better. The end result is you have the highest ilvl 3 azerite pieces you can get your hands on with your best combo of traits, and a half set of bis and half set that happens to be better than your bis just because it Titanforged or it came with a socket. So you Sim. Often. Pretty much each time you get a decent piece of gear.  
---
Hell look at every BFA bis loot list. Its all "Here's an ideal list but because of Titanforging, you have to sim higher ilvl pieces than what you have on that"
---
Your two options are felwood and eastern plaguelands. There are more mobs in eastern, but the eles in felwood have a significantly higher drop chance. 8% vs 3% so I went with felwood, water essence went by the fastest so I'd recommend you do the same. But there are much more water eles in eastern so if felwood is too camped you can try there instead.

Dude...c’mon...the game is 15 years old and we used to play it with 20 FPS on pentium 4 processors at best with dial up Internet. 
---
You can’t say it was hard back then and forget the setups we played on compared to today. Imagine doing any of the current retail raids with 20 FPS and how hard that would be...
---
People really need to understand that all of Classic will be a joke for the simple fact that we know everything already and we play at 60+ FPS with awesome PC setups. For the average player,NOTHING in Classic should be hard.
---
Fastest way is via a Warlock summon. Realistic way is to run from Southshore up past Dalaran and then swim (or island hope) to come out just next to Undercity. Run east to SM along the road and hope for the best.
---
Thanks!
---
Dude, my guild wiped on rag last week and are still 9/10 and I’m loving every second of it! It drives me nuts when people think you’re not playing the game unless you are clearing content.
---
We have so many new players in the guild it’s not even funny, and I don’t remember shit from 14 years ago.
---
I watched this episode over and over months before classic dropped. Someone was hosting a 24 hour stream of this on twitch like a week before launch
---
Classic was causal all the way up to twin-emps   
---
Game was never hard, and every vanilla player has been saying this from the start. Not sure where people got the notion that it was ever hard.
---
Gear makes no difference to demo shout?
---
45% avoidance including block? Which is like 40% of the damage at most? 
---
Again this is pointless because no one gives a shit about non elites.
---
Except that unless you are deliberately antagonize me, you can understand what the meaning of "Top esports team  [**...**] play  for fun"
---
BWL won’t be hard either. People will still have no issues beating it. The entirety of Classic will be a joke when people are used to retail mechanics.

Their bombastic presence on the battlefield and in the bedroom;)
---
Focus? maybe not.  
---
But content that has longevity and is always different? That's where pvp shines.
---
res sickness, assuming you have money to repair and swap locations, there are more than 2 zones where you can level from the 20-50 range and not every zone is camped to heck  
---
if you see a roaming elite you dont charge face first, you run around it .
---
You mean that one that's easily bis right up until onyxia/mc weps?
---
run the quest for mirah's song to the end and there's a decent 2H and shield also.
---
It’ll change. You’ll start to see the try-hards decked out in T2/T3 and mix-matching gear from ZG and AQ.
---
There’s just nothing at this point to make us look different from one another.
---
It’s actually 60%-100% I’m at ~100 shield-block (Drillborer+(3) might) But OPs last question was what was the break point for battleshout compared to demo in threat generation. Which was what I was replying to. Demo is more efficient than battle shout at &gt;6 mobs.
---
Plus the increased block means more shield spike threat. 
---
And gear will make a difference in the healer agro.
---
Or maybe your MT is bad?
---
Aka a question that should be answered, " Don't use either tab sundering is higher tps"
---
stop crying having bis gear is way better than a slot machine titan forge that is retail
---
Explain How that will be a disaster?

Cool

Saw someone with 600 runs for savage gladiator chest
---
HEY EVERYBODY COME LOOK AT THIS GUYS DICK! LOOK HOW BIG IT IS! SEE IT FLAPPING AROUND? LOOK AT THIS BIG DICK!
---
Because it’s a mage and 95.69% of them are special.
---
and more health!
---
Savage Gladiator Chest. I ran probably 100 runs of it while I was leveling and plenty more times at 60. After seeing that post that someone said they had done it 600 times I decided to start keeping actual track on a sheet.
---
So far up to 51 runs over 3 days. Seen Gorosh 7 times and no chest drop still.
---
They even hint at releasing phase three early in 2020. Like Holy shit. They should have made slower realms or something, if this was the speed they wanted to set. 99% of my guild doesn't want more content already. The other 1% just quit when they heard world PvP was coming out already.
---
I think it would be interesting for Blizz to realease the expansions tuned for level 60 and revamp the zones in TBC and Wrath for no flying mounts.
---
Edit: Blizz has a unique opprtunity with Classic to explore different design decisions than they made with retail.
---
yes we need phase 2, most people have no content we just clear raids in 2 hours and sit afk in orgrimmar. you had 2 months to level if you couldnt do that sucks to be you..  dont expect the game to cater to casuals
---
So, I've been leveling as Sub dagger Rogue so far and I love it. However, things have started to become harder now that I've hit early 20s, should I switch to swords?
---
It’s not way faster. It’s like a 2-3 week difference.
---
They aren’t basing these things off streamers or complaints or anything else. They said from day one it wouldn’t be slower than it came out in vanilla, and in some occasions might be slightly faster.
---
Where after Westfall? 
---
I'll soon finish with Westfall and I've heard Duskwood will be to PvP oriented once Phase 2 comes in.
---
11 year olds bought this game in 2005 during "phase 2" and got to 60 just fine, jesus christ.
---
There will be people ganking each other, there will be plenty more that just want to level rather than make enemies for a negligible amount of honor pre-60.
---
Everyone calm down.
---
Interesting, my guild destroys MC, no wipes on any bosses including rag but ony destroys us. We one shot MC in 2 hours then took 2 hours of wiping ony to down her
---
I would like to see changes based on player voted polls, much like how old school runescape does.  A bit after naxx or course.
---
I do enjoy the feeling of danger tho with a potential rogue coming out of nowhere, kill me once , ok that was fun, kill me over and over and corpse camp??? Most people dont do that but its certainly annoying.
---
I believe there are plenty of places where they had planned some sort of dungeon/raid that was scrapped with the release of TBC. These places should get casted with renew. And in these places the gear could be similar to power lvls of what is out but be tailored to classes that have gaps in gear. Like resto shamans wear a lot of cloth could get mail upgrades or more leather drops with spell power/int  for boomkins.
---
Some people have played some amount of Wrath-&gt;BFA, and gotten accustomed to threat not being an issue without still being a retail player. The player base was never expected to be Vanilla only players. Just those that prefer it too retail.
---
A lot of people were selling rings for 50g, maul/staff for 70-100g. Occasionally someone would also buy other drops.  
---
Without selling drops to people, its still the most profitable farm once you get it down. Unless mining prices are high in which case the mithril ore/solid stone from maraudon can make that competitive.
---
had the same feelings when OldSchool Runescape came out in 2013
---
But it isn’t more tps on &gt;6 mob packs. Demo is more tps. Sunder is 250-260 threat before threat modifiers. And demo is 43*6 = 258. 
---
I want to say &gt;7 demo would be more tps confidently. 
---
It’s for the same reason on Nefarian for the adds you stick a warrior in a group with 4 hunters/locks and spam battle shout. Because 4+4+1= 9 buffed targets @ 55 threat a pop.
---
I set my expectations at start of run that it probably won't  drop... Also change it up, don't ONLY run that for 7 days straight.
---
Go PvP, go farm gold... Go RP ... Play an ult..Go do something IRL ;)
---
Put it into perspective..Depending on the peice you might replace it the next day in MC or it's not that much of a significant upgrade will anyone but you notice?
---
 Shout out to my warlock guildie friend who beat me on reed and got the OP MC trinket next day... I'll pay you back one day... One day...
---
Edit: phone auto corrects
---
Im a carebear PvE scrub, so shit won't feel any different.
---
Actually no... there might end up being a lot of organized PvP raids, who knows.
---
The horde flight path at felwood post. Mind control people who land from their flight off the cliff - it's res sickness or a 20+ minute corpse run as their ghost spawns in darkshore. Blackrock mountain is obviously straight up evil too. 
---
MCing people into mobs so they take gear damage is always funny. Lurking near the end of any escort or otherwise tough quest.
---
I've bought warden and it was completely unnecessary.  The entire meta is about tps, not mitigation. I'm running pummelers only. That's it.
---
It’s not up for debate that tanks don’t generate threat like in retail. 1 sunder isn’t infinite threat. Taunts can also be resisted.
---
Just think about the fact that at 43, you're about halfway to 60 (I think 45 is halfway). I think no matter how fast you can level the mage, the rogue has so much ground that it's going to be faster.
---
I'd say 2-3 weeks in a time frame of 2 months is way faster yes. Also take a look at the release date of original vanilla and the release date of dire maul. 
---
Well then I don't know who they are basing it off of, because it's not the average player.
---
So there's no way to know where the best year will drop?
---
The good things about Wrath was the zones and the raids. The bad things.. gear tokens, dailies.
---
I’m at 53 with my warrior. I’m seeing a trend here.
---
Of Shadow wrath dropped a few times but it was +20 and not +21.
---
Turtle meat from hillbrad
---
Strider meat darkshore.
---
That does seem like quite the difference to me as well.
---
There really isn’t an instance where you pull &gt;6 elites unless someone fucked up or if you’re running an AoE speed clear. The former is a skill issue, the latter it really doesn’t matter what the tank does as long as people kite properly and the tank keeps them clustered
---
If I had &gt;6 elites because some huntard pulled, I’d  battle stance -&gt; retaliation -&gt; d stance -&gt; challenging shout  -&gt; demo shout once -&gt; whirlwind &gt; shield slam &gt; revenge &gt; sunder.  Cleave dumps as needed. Weave a fear in there if possible if it’s safe. Maybe throw in a t-clap for damage mitigation. 
---
I agree 100% straight demo on 6 elites ain’t gunna work. Never argued it would. Just saying sunder on 10 mobs for example, isn’t going to be higher tps, multiplicative included.
---
yes you are
---
They confirmed paid char transfers will come at some point but haven't said when. So far the only transfers have been the free ones but you weren't able to pick what realm you wanted to go, only the assigned one
---
Isnt the drop rate like 15%? We had 3 drop in the past 3 weeks. We had 2 eye of shadows drop on first farm, 2 on second. The eyes now go for 200g...
---
It's hardly cutting edge people hitting 60 so far though, many casuals have reached it by this point as well.
---
Is it worth doing if keys are 50s each on my server? I would just implement it into my run passed guzzler ? Thanks
---
I don't really think 5% less damage is massively gimped but ok.
---
Kill me
---
\[laughs in stalagg\]
---
What does phase two have to do with your leveling speed.  All it’s doing is adding honor.. there will be a few spots people flock to to world pvp.. just avoid those places and keep leveling... whys everyone so worked up about it. 
---
Personally I can’t wait. Have had all my best in slot for weeks... mostly just log on to farm mats for MC which takes a couple hrs a week.
---
I work 50 hrs a week too.
---
Just curious why you don't find a guild that is raiding and having fun? Not every guild it there is full of ass hats.
---
Is it worth it if keys are 50s each on my server? I would just add it into my run like you. Thanks
---
Which NA server has a good community vibe? Alliance side
---
I’m pretty sure you can raid Karazhan with t3 but yea I agree. I will do the same when(if) they release cata because I stopped playing after wotlk :) but everything till then I love
---
This is why a classic plus in the style of OSRS if ideal. New content that is player approved at nearly every step.
---

---
9% hitcap (6% for 305 skill) is only for yellow attacks (abilities like Sinister Strike) and two-handed weapons.
---
When dual-wielding, your melee swings have a 27% chance (24% with 305 skill) chance to miss. That's why hit past the hitcap is still useful. 
---
Now, rogues get so much +skill and +hit from talents that they only need 1% to reach their soft hitcap, and warriors are ~~ab~~using the heroic strike ~~bug~~ feature, so hit past the yellow hitcap isn't as valuable as it would be, BUT there comes a point where hit starts being valuable again. Once you reach a certain amount of crit, you'll need more hit in order to crit more. Because of the way critical strikes are calculated, you will only crit if your attack doesn't glance or misses through a miss/dodge/parry.
---
If, for example, your attacks have 20% chance to miss, 25% chance to glance and 10% chance to be dodged, your crit cap would be 45%. Even if you had 50% chance to crit, only 45% of your attacks would crit because of this limitation. To overcome it, you'd want more hit in order to reduce your % of misses and thus increase your % of crits. This is specificallly related to your white autoattack swings, of course.
---
Same. Yikes.
---
Rrspawns from vendors vary from items to items, and from vendors to vendors. Might be hard to tell
---
Why not put their character names?! 
---
Or was it not appropriate to write "SlutCrusher88" on a cup?
---
How ever you want to justify knocking off the warcraft brotha.
---
Here’s the deal - some racials are better than others, true - but for the most part they’re small enough that they can be accounted for via other means. I’m a huge advocate of always play what you want and have the racials as an afterthought. 
---
When it comes to Priests, it’s a bit different - not only do you have your core racials but you also get additional Priest skills that are determined by your race. 
---
The strongest of these (IMO) is the instant self-heal - it’s very potent and can easily sway the tide of a close match up in both 1v1 and group PvP.  It will also save your ass in those oh shit PvE moments. This skill is only available to human and dwarf Priests. 
---
The other (and there’s arguments to be made for this being the strongest) is an insta-cast, tiny-mana cost Fear Ward on a 30s cooldown that can be used on yourself or others that lasts 10 minutes (or until it blocks a fear). This is exclusively available to dwarves. Coupled with your core racial being able to remove Blind, this makes for a quite formidable Priest.
---
Shadowmeld is a great skill and can lead to some creative uses - but it’s power lies in waiting for the enemy to come to you, whereas all the others I mentioned you’ll make constant use of in PvP and frequently in PvE.
---
It really depends on what you want out of the class. If you plan on PvPing a lot you’ll eventually regret being a NE.
---
If you have 800g at 55, get the mount. You shouldn't have any issue getting money for the helm after. I have 300g at 60 because I haven't really been farming.

---
I don't know how to break it to you, but he's a troll and you're giving him exactly what he wants.
---
You will not be able to lvl up.
---
I am mostly solo leveling yeah, thanks!
---
You see less 60s around because a large portion of people who have hit 60 already have their BiS (or near enough) and just log in to raid with their guild now. 
---
Really honor should have been in since launch so everyone leveled through it.
---
It's only a couple of weeks quicker than vanilla, I don't think MC was even full cleared at this point of Vanilla though and things are progressing faster and easier right now with all the access to guides, addons, 1.12 talents, 1.12 loot tables etc so it fits time wise.
---
Remember too the main player base that got this off the ground to begin with was the player base from pservers who are going to be the ones pushing for more content the most. I'm not at that point and I play pretty casually but that's just how it is.
---
Most excellent response good sir. 10/10 Horde pvp tokens for you.
---
Thank you for replying.
---
I feel like everyone blames retail players when it's been proven several times over that AoE tanking is still a thing in Classic. The issue is the reluctance/refusal of Vanilla players to adapt, tanks losing aggro isn't a big deal, no one is getting 1-shotted anymore.   
---
What I do notice is how slow some people's reaction are when tanks lose aggro, healers literally sit there and watch the 4 second swing timer of a mob on a DPS and not even start a cast, tanks taking forever to re taunt, this is on single target pulls.   
---
I picked up mage for Classic since I tanked my entire time playing WoW and wanted to do something else, like everyone I thought classic would be like Vanilla but it's not, my memory is wrong and AoE tanking is more than feasible.
---
Oh yea for sure, 60 at this point is pretty normal. I mean I'm a no lifer who hit 60 on week 2 and already have a second 60. I just mean to say that no matter where you are in progression, classic is really popular right now and there are going to be people you can find that you'll be able to raid with no matter how far "behind" you may think you are.
---
killing grey players does not lose a player honor, and does not provide a dishonorable kill. that is only for killing opposing-faction civilian npcs
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Dishonorable_Kill
---
You know that grey hazy thing you run through when you die. That's the shadlowlands.
---
You don't lose honor for ganking someone lower than you.
---
From time to time same thread gets started and it is always the same, not against tos, blizzard allows it. Cheating? How so? I tried dual boxing just to see how it is, and it is fun, pvp'ing i still preffer to solo on my lock vs 2 mages that i leveled. Can you do more stuff when you have more than 1 char, sure, but, how is that cheating? Its still way weaker than say 5 multibox vs 5 man party.
---
I know you'll never see this since I'm blocked and all, but its worth replying for all the other people who seem awfully mad at me for suggesting that the op obviously made a mistake by playing on a pvp server. 
---
The only thing that changes in phase two is that world pvp will now be actively encouraged by game mechanics (honor system) when it wasn't before. 
---
World pvp is the entire point of a pvp server. 
---
The idea that someone would be concerned they may have made a mistake by rolling on a pvp server because phase 2 is coming out is... Well it seems incredibly obvious to me that the answer to the op's question is yes. So get mad if you like, but all I did was answer a Reddit questing earnestly.
---
Sword spec is better than mace spec for pve but I def recommend going maces while leveling bc you can get cheap blue mace upgrades from the AH.
---
early 50s I spent a couple levels grinding. would just leave my char gaining rested near a grind spot, log on for 30-60 minutes and just watch a tv show while i grinding out the rest. Over the course of a week I did 2 levels very easily this way which put me way ahead on how many quests i had that felt reasonable to do. Made the rest of the 50's a cake walk as i could still pick and choose what quests with dungeons thrown in and it was very fun.
---
Thank you.
---
This happened to me in Kargath, legit took me 2 minutes to work out wtf was going on
---
Lights Hope is already a no go zone on Grobbulus and we have 50/50 faction parity. 
---
I find the alliance tend to not want to PvP was much as Horde, in a general sense.
---
You should be running lots of dungeons anyway. If you don't care about leveling speed thats one thing,but you are also kind of complaining about leveling speed.
---
faction imbalance was an issue in vanilla as well. They didn't do anything about it.
---
Level 31 and alliance
---
Thanks for the tips
---
Ravager is the god that gives, and gives plenty.
---
Especially on broken tooth that would suck
---
I tried that and it didnt seem to help.
---
It would say a zone is for level 30-35 for example, you go there and do 5 quests and get to level 31 then the next lot of quests are for level 35 and become too hard to complete.
---
I am thinking I will need to go between several zones
---
I've heard about an addon that tracks which skills you are able to get from trainers, and I'm hoping it will help save me trips back to town. I'm looking for something that will show both class skills and professions
---
I hear Alliance questing gets harder and harder since many of the contested zones are Horde favoured. You should he close to being able to go to STV, but I believe you’re also in the level range for Hillsbrad. You could always grind SM until level 40, as well.
---
My writing is horrible. Sorry :/ did just enough with it to pass classes and become a nurse. Wish I was better tho.
---
I've rolled on a PVP server, thinking that it must be the tr00 vanilla experience because most of the servers are PVP, but as someone who doesn't really like ganking people, really all that's changed is that every couple of hours I get an extra unavoidable death sprinkled on my grind, when some asshole attacks me in an unwinnable matchup. And I can only imagine it's going to get exponentially worse when phase 2 hits.
---
Holy text wall Batman!

Pro tip; Reddit for some reason doesn't do paragraphs properly. If you want to create a paragraph you need to press enter twice.

---
I levelled as deep prot, gimping my own experience so I could tank dungeons for aggravating nerds.
---
Sounds as dumb as it is.
---
Replace deep prot with holy/resto and same.
---
Intentional or otherwise, that's what it was. Heck, a lot of "good for the game even if players bitch about them" mechanics in classic fall under similar circumstances.
---
How is rage generated for Fury (31)/Prot (20) wars?
---
I assume the large/big crits and constant dmg is it. 
---
I'm slowly getting pre-bis gear (and some proper bis gear i.e. edgemasters [im a tauren] and myrmidon's signet [idk if this is good for dps - i think it's great for prot right?]) so i'm still a bit rage starved.
---
Also, for the execute phase, do you just regen rage quite quickly? I find i can do one execute, maybe 2 before the boss is dead. (3 if we are slow).
---
If you’d please provide one example where someone was banned without Blizzard citing some relevant section of the EULA/CoC/etc, that’d be great.
---
Just because a few of you don’t like this and think it should be bannable doesn’t mean it is.
---
I’ve been killing people inside gadget without aggroing the guards (not on roofs, just avoiding pats) and tons of people want me banned. Every GM I’ve spoken to said it was fine, and I also floated this plan to a couple of them and got nothing but green lights.
---
You’re welcome :)
---
Nope, the channel got banned. It was called ClassicHype and was most certainly not official blizz lol.
---
Just grind the grimtotems or gnolls in Feralas.  Then in upper 40s skystormers hippogryphs also in Feralas.  It may be boring but the XP per hour znd gold per hour is great.  You can do this up to 51/52 then look at doing Un'Goro/WPL.
---
considering you can ignore entire mechanics of fights by going ham right at the start, yeah it matters.
---
Which is why its happening heaps now.
---
Bwl doesnt come with p2, so dont worry, its not soon. You have 3 months at least to farm whatever you want til its release.
---
Of course it is. But classic tanking isn't so easy, not every tank is well enough geared/in the right talents to do their job. Even then the best of plans can be ruined by accidental tab target/ass/bad target focus pulls from DPS.
---
Your job, as much as is possible, is to accomodate for other players messing up. Much like all melee DPS should keep an eye on the healer for aggro. If ads keep leashing onto the healer, melee dps should peel them off to help the tank. Healing a tank +1 is far easier than just healing a tank with cast pushback.
---
I don't think anyone would have asked had you not brought it up. Not that weird of a guild name tbh, feels more like you want someone to ask
---
Would it be faster to downrank sw:p on the small ones? The rank you are using seems to be too high.
---
Im gonna use this method, thanks mate!
---
It's diiferent duoing than soloing.  As a duo you kill faster and more efficiently while also killing many more mobs for drop quests.
---
11/0/40 or 10/0/41 with Winter's Chill.
---
Were all gonna make it bro
---
Good luck finding her though
---
It's actually a great stat stick for pvp.
---
Steer clear of me!
---
May god have mercy on your soul because the other faction wont

How do you evade bug after loregrain? The statue right behind him or is it another statue? Ty
---
How? This is the best in slot helm through Naxx. He will wear it every second from now until eternity. He will be on the mount only when he’s outdoors and out of combat.
---
Sounds like you're not enjoying it.
---
So why are you still playing?
---
/wa &gt; new &gt; choose the type you want &gt; trigger tab &gt; type:aura, unit:player, aura type:buff &gt; name: whatever the name of the buff is. i assume its just Felstriker
---
Can someone pixelate blur the sharp part of the sword lmao
---
I dont think you can use bloodrage in berserker stance
---
If you join any hardcore raiding guild
---
And they saw you with an epic mount before you had all crafted and BoE BiS, Your professions maxed out, enchants and consumables ready to go
---
You would be gkicked in a heartbeat.
---
So get your epic mount if you dont care about being in really good guilds that can clear Naxx 40 with ease.
---
As a ex hardcore raider your epic mount isnt something that's required to be the best.
---
Will depend on the balance of your server. Also getting the upper ranks of pvp rank 12.13,14 requires a lot of work. Basically no-lifing for a month, as well as getting kinda lucky. For those people all kills matter. As long as they give some sort of boost, no matter how small (60 killing 48 is lowest they can go), they will go for it. 
---
With that said, I would continue to do what it is you do. But beware of those types of people
---
Sooo don’t play on a pvp server??? You knew this was gonna happen. Go to a pve if you can’t hang with the rest of us
---
The damage lost from a glancing blow can be reduced with weapon skill however
---
Im so bored i dont know what to do anymore. Its to much farming and prepairing for later phases with consumes and everything, and i need new content badly before i stop play for a while, but p2 kinda saves the day a little bit
---
&gt; So you should award someone who shows up to 50% of raids before someone who shows up for 100%? 
---
Loot council takes attendance into consideration...
---
Renew is all we need to blast away forever
---
You don’t get honor for killing lowbies lol. Noones farming stv hahahaha
---
You talk about hit rating
---
And then say your tanks go duel wield...
---
That's a huge contradiction
---
Some raid bosses have fear mechanics. Horde have shaman that can use totems to dispel fear.
---
Every race of priest has unique priest skills, and the Dwarven skill is a fear ward. Necessary for some fights as no other class or race on Alliance side has racials or spells to counter the mechanic.
---
For some classes, weapons is one of the easier things to get. Ice Barbed Spear is a quick pickup in AV. Then farm up to the The Unstoppable Force.
---
Who said that you have to follow an online guide to play this game? Literally play how you want. The only downfall is that if you’re a completionist, you’ll potentially miss out on end game content/gear based on what you’re tryna do. 
---
I played from vanilla to the start of cata, I never did end game content until wotlk and that’s because the game became so popular by that point that irl friends were playing and raiding in that expansion, so I wanted to keep up.
---
Who gives a fuck about bis man, any better piece of gear is an improvement. If you really want to raid and do all that bullshit then you know what is involved and only are catering to your own desires to try and experience it. The ironic thing is you don’t even need bis gear to beat raids, but if you don’t have a raid group with the similar mindset to you (very difficult to find 40 likeminded individuals, probably easier to get bis gear) then you probably won’t be accepted into pugs without bis gear.
---
Bootlickers are bootlickers. Yeah, we've been over this. You worship at the altar of Blizzard and probably have the famous Josh Allen post plastered all over your room. "While a r1 glad might like having niche abilities.. an entry-level PvP'er could be turned off by having to learn so much..."
---
Those were introduced in BC.
---
Thanks! I’ll give this a shot.
---
Actually bis gear in current wow is almost impossible to figure out without simming due to the amount of titanforging/ chance at gemsockets or benthic bs. It is in a terrible state for most classes that you need to pay a service to truly know what piece of gear is better than another.
---
But there has been tons of changes already, or as some would say "compromises". I would have loved if Classic started with a patch way earlier than 1.12.
---
Fair point.
---
I guess I should emphasis that I dont think you can be bad at the game if you played everyday trying to be good at it for 15yrs
---
If had the game for 15yrs and never gone beyond leveling then yes. I would agree with you.
---
So because I don’t want to get killed over and over again by some guy who farms mats 12-6 and once prime time comes around goes to contested zones to farm lower level players just to grief them I shouldn’t play pvp. Okay sorry my bad. Didn’t know pvp was reserved for no lifers only.
---
Well its either dwarf, which looks decent in most gear, or stocky misshapen humans / goofy lanky elves with dumb casting animations.
---
Oh.. so pvp is only okay when you wanna gank. Not okay for others.. I see.
---
No one is “farming” low lvl players.. you get sooooo little honor for killing people lower lvl than you it’s not worth it.
---
LMAO P5 has BG's so it's a huge difference to P2 where all the virgin cucks will camp everywhere relevant.
---
Skill and experience would tend to lean towards people knowing the best gear to use... I dont thing that's a good argument.
---
you've already been banned for RMT before, everyone knows you're doing it again.
---
This is an absolute trash spec that doesn't accomplish anything well.  It's a jack of all shit spec.
---
The only thing it's good for is dueling.  
---
You don't need survival for any world (OR RAID) content that SM/Ruin or DS/ruin can't handle.
---
I’m a Druid and I have it. I absolutely love that thing. So much int, stam, MP5. Benefits me whether I am healing or playing ranged dps, and the stam is amazing in PvP.

Is it more of a dps increase to have curse of shadows up or agony?  Assuming just for 1 warlock in raid
---
No. It’s not. Idk what he meant.
---
This sub has some crazy takes. Its honestly filled with a bunch of casuals / people who have far less time than they used to back in the day,  people who keep bitching about content releases because "most people arent even 60 yet" and people who feel entitled to be able to raid in their solo/ pvp/meme spec under the guise of anti elitism /min maxing. Ive heard some people say that some people come to vanilla cuz theyre not good enough to raid in retail,  it seems there is some truth to that. People playing 3 hrs a week and cant be bothered to raid as a raid spec feel entitled to be able to join good raid guilds and want blizz to hold back the games content so they dont get left behind even when they play minimally.  Even though the real "#trueclassicexperience" was that most people who even raided never got past Vael even when tbc was just weeks away. Just watch people say "b..but most people havent even cleared bwl yet" when aq40 is a couple weeks away,  all the while still determined to raid as their crappy specs because "fuck these min maxers ruining the game". Its absurd.

what abuse of herois strike do you mean? Can you elaborate I'm really interested
---
Each level just takes a bit longer. I had a good time 50-60, finished Feralas, Ungoro, Felwood, Blasted Lands, Burning Steppes, WPL, and ran ST a few times and then BRD a lot. I dinged 60 with most of EPL still to go and then started doing a lot of LBRS, Strath and Scholo and eventually UBRS.
---
Didn’t get any of my BIS items while leveling (RIP) so been doing that for the last few weeks (now have most). It’s taken a lot of dungeon runs for BIS though, more than I would have stomached while leveling.
---
In everything you say, i can tell you are pretty new to classic and not very good with mage yet. I dont agree with anything you say. (I played mage on private server and playing mage now)
---
Probably RP walk around in the cave

Wait. ZF at 58?? Do you still get xp in zf at 58??
---
Westfall is nice
---
Yeah I’m sure some random low tier GM will have any insight on this future implementation. I’d love to hear your brilliant deduction though Oliver.
---
I love the remark “figures” people get salty haha
---
I’ll admit, I laughed out loud.
---
Xloot is the best I've found so far.
---
Private server experience shows that people will indeed farm everyone lvl48-59 often leaving the rankers from the other faction relatively alone.  
---
Or they will sit at flight points in small groups killing everything coming in or trying to go out.  
---
Or they will win-trade with some guild fro. The other faction, outpacing the honor "honest" players can make.
---
Why? Because ranking is all about who gets the most honor on your faction. You actually don't compete with the enemy faction but with the guys from your own faction. Engaging in fights that are not good honor per time, like engaging in mass pvp, or in high pitched duels between equal opponents, is bad honor.
---
Having a honor system without bgs may be interesting for nostalgia sake but many pepole will have their nostalgia goggles punched right into their face.
---
Think im actually going to start downvoting these posts...
---
Anyone else with me? Or am I just being a big prick?
---
I've always played mage and druid and most other classes as alts but never played Hunter, warrior, or shaman. What's a better or more fun alt to play, Hunter or warrior? I'll buy good boe green gear to help so it shouldn't be too bad to level warrior...I also do like tanking and I wanna see how warriors tank compared to bear druid. But I've seen hunters tank with their pets all the time!
---
What overpower add-on do you use?
---
It's always going to be too soon for a lot of people, even if they wait until mid next year to release P2 you'll get people saying that it's too soon

---
Racist.
---
Troll is a pretty good race to do that with.
---
You have this problem for many reasons. PServrs are one. If they never existed, then no one would know about these post vanilla bis lists. Some would theorycraft it, but they wouldn't be so popular. 
---
Two, people are better and more prepared than in vanilla. It's just a shame but its true.
---
And heres the big reason. This isn't vanilla WoW. This is a bastardized version of Legion/Vanilla. We're playing on a patch where everything has been nerfed. True original progression around January 05 was different. Scholo/Strath were done with 10 man raids. UBRS was done with 15 man raids, sometimes more. This patch has nerfed all of that. Remember when you had to race to get the ziggurats down or you were screwed? Or when trash respawned within minutes? That's gone now. 
---
Talents are a big issue too. In January 05 for example, no class had their revamp. Many specs were borderline unplayable. Survival hunter for example had a garbage melee bleed as its 31 point talent. Warriors did AWFUL damage at this point in WoW, yet right now were seeing how they wreck everything. 
---
Then theres the item issue. Go compare items like Banthok's Sash from 05 to now. It was a green if i recall with int and stamina. Now its a BIS caster belt as it's amazing. Were also playing with the MC loot that wasn't here until I believe patch 1.4 and 1.5. In fact the majority of loot that is actually good from MC is from these patches. Before then it was all tier loot and crappy items.
---
All of these things contribute to why the game isn't the same. You're gonna be shocked when you see BWL too. Remember kiting on Razorgore? We used to have hunters kite the dragons and warriors with piercing howl kited the orc melee mobs. Well now youre going to see guilds just straight up DPS every single mob down. A strategy Blizzard never intended to be possible.
---
Druid lives matter!
---
Not even go play retail
---
They have these AMAZING things called... PvE servers! Where you can quest and level in peace without having to worry about being ganked or attacked by people much higher level!
---
If you can't handle world PvP, you shouldn't be playing on a PvP server. Simple as that.
---
Sounds super cool, what Realm?
---
On my server, pre phase 2 announcement it cost me 40 ish gold for 1-250 then 150 ish gold for 1-315. Prices have spiked since phase 2 announcement though. I would do it sooner rather than later tbh.
---
No lol, warrior
---
The first few weeks will be rough
---
OCE rep.
---
No, it is not realistic.
---
Good luck! 
---
I did notice it's a little harder/slower to find groups there now a lot of the no lifers like me have moved on to other things. But if you can tank that's the hardest slot to fill ;)
---
if you know you are going to be replacing it relatively quickly, then just a cheap - effective/useful - enchant is fine. 
---
for you BIS gear, obviously the +8 would be used (if you can afford it). I'm assuming the +8 is the superior one but idk for (and it doesn't matter to answer your question, as the cheaper one will be sufficient).
---
Sorry that's been your experience. Very different from what I've seen with pugs.
---
The gist of it is that when you have a HS queued up, your offhand's attacks are calculated like mainhand attacks, so people have made a macro that cancels HS, with the goal being to have HS queued as much as possible, without actually ever using it.
---
Who pissed in your cornflakes? It's like everyone in this sub thinks classic is the greatest thing on earth and if you like anything else then you're delusional. You can like what you want without pissing all over the shit that other people are excited for
---
Heroic strike turns your next MH auto attack into a yellow attack. So it has the standard 6 or 9 % penalty. So any hit rating above the soft cap is useless for that swing (just like it is for any special ability) 
---
Between when you press Heroic strike and when it actually occurs (your mh swing timer) your offhand attacks also have the special hit chance instead of the white hit chance. 
---
That’s the bug. 
---
If you can keep heroic strike in que full time, you basically need hardly any hit rating. 
---
The exploit is queueing HS and canceling it before it actually spends your rage. Saving that rage allows you to use it again.
---
They do it now because dishonorable kills arent in the game. Once they are introduced they wont be killing people low level less as it negatively impacts honor gains which is what they are farming people for in the first place.

---
Wow thats more i could imagine. Thank you!
---
This is entirely dependent on your server split. I'm assuming you're alliance because your friend is warning you but if you are 48+ your likely going to see very large parties of horde camping flight points and contested towns. Popular farming spots, dungeon entrances, quest turn ins, etc will be a never ending fight for your life just being in the area. My server is at the point where the run from Thorium Point (Searing Gorge) to BRD will average you 4-6 deaths from the time you land until you zone in, assuming you make 0 detours. At basically all hours of the day we have seen horde owning the path up to the entrance of Black Rock mountain, the hallway and lava jump point, the chains and lava ramp, and then random groups up to a large pack at the instance. We are talking 50ish minimum that you need to run through during non peak times and it has been this way for about 2 weeks maybe longer. Right now, these are just bored groups looking to PvP while they wait to form a group for a dungeon or raid. When honor is released, this will likely expand to the point where groups will begin roaming for kills in the zone as it will be difficult for everyone who wants honor to get it from the groups going through. 
---
So while you say you welcome the challenge, I can see why your friend doesn't think you get it. A lot of servers were severely horde dominated based on statistics I've seen in September (haven't seen newer) and it feels like it gets worse every week. Honor may see some servers lose the rest of their alliance population as the game becomes unplayable.
---
Look, i'm not saying it's you, but if all the guilds you joined died...well they were healthy before you joined...
---
again, not pointing fingers, just saying..
---
&lt;jk&gt;
---
Yeah that sucks dude
---
I’m trying to think of a better race to have a better raid comp
---
I’d rather see a Classic+. Alternate timeline kinda deal with continuous updates balanced in the spirit of wow using expansion assets, etc...
---
Like instead of TBC taking us to Outland, a 2nd invasion comes through. Fight it back AQ style, then we can access a couple rebalanced dungeons and a raid through the portal and a very abbreviated “Outlands” hub map. Or even just reskin and rewrite it to fit on Azeroth - like they build the hellfire peninsula dungeon in Blasted Lands, etc....
---
Add Icecrown eventually, but just the good stuff. No extended level cap, no leveling quests - decent gear quests, horizontal (not vertical) progression, and new raids/5 mans for vertical progression - trade skill recipes, gap filler gear, alternate pre BIS gear, rep farming, etc..
---
Doesn’t even have to be the same story or order, mix and match pieces and build something new. Introduce Kul Tiras and stick some reskinned Northrend content/dungeons in it.
---
We pay our sub, we can get periodic updates of rejiggered old content w/o full expand.
---
Have it be Classic and Classic+. You can stay on Classic and past Naxx, it stays the same forever. Or, whenever you want you can take a one way transfer to Classic+.
---
Who?
---
Actually no, I have all my characters on one account and want to separate my mage to another account. So actually I’d be paying more money and not saving any.
---
Fear has already been investigated by Blizzard and is working as intended
---
If you have heroic strike que’d the game calculates your miss chance of white hits as your special attack miss chance. So warriors are queuing HS and cancelling it quickly to increase their auto attack  hit chance
---
.TLDR: your off hand miss chance is reduced to 0 while you have heroic strike que’d (if you have 6%hit @ 305 or 9% @ 300)
---
I don’t really play melee so I used made up numbers for the example, thanks for the info though.
---
*looks at druid T1 set bonus*
---
Well crap.
---
Feats for the set, it's absurdly good
---
What I want to know is who's actually buying it?
---
&gt;It's all about meters and dick-waving. It doesn't matter if you're actually contributing to the success of the raid and the execution of the strategy; how big is your bar on the meter?  
---
Bingo.
---
Roughly 38 for my warrior. Early to mid 30s was quite a slog, but then I went and did a bunch of SM Lib, Arms, and then Cath. I just flew through the levels to 44, then slowed down a decent bit until 46? I then spammed ZF to 52, which was also pretty damn fast.
---
Now I'm stuck in the sense that I'm having to learn how to tank the proper way since everyone tells me 2H tanking just isn't a good idea for BRD on. It's not bad, I'm making progress, but it's certainly a learning curve I have to get over.
---
You can literally still do that now too by giving the tank two GCDs.
---
Embarrassing for me to try make shorter macro and fail so bad. Thank you! :)
---
They also said p1 will be the longest phase. Does that mean p3 in 1 month?
---
....people....why are you downvoting this? He's obviously kidding.
---
That could have been me, I stand by it!
---
Even if you don't really enjoy world PvP, case in which the answer to your question is yes, you should reroll on a PvE server, I doubt it will be that bad.
---
Yes, there will be camping and țes there will be ganking, but first of all the opposing faction can't be anywhere at once and secondly you own faction's 60s should also be around the same contested zones, often fighting for the same camping spots (dungeon entrances)
---
I would love to see TBC and WotLK but keeping it more close to Classic. Never introduce flying, never introduce dungeon finder. And then make tweaks accordingly, like solve problem with zones that have been designed for flying mounts.
---
Of course it would be great to still keep Classic content relevant. Making just new dedicated servers might tear player base too much if there is three different versions of the game.
---
Classic+ idea is my favourite but it can be risky. If content they produce does not feel like Classic, players might move back to private servers. Blizzard is company and from business point of view I am more sure that if they give us more content, it will be TBC and not Classic+ as it's just more risk free way.
---
Where are these turboclowns stanning for dark pact coming from? Shitty talent becomes irrelevant at 60 and arguably is never even relevant in the first place. If the argument is about saving money on food and water (cheap ass idiots) then go Sm/ds and you are a soloing pve god and don’t even need food/water.
---
For context: Hasan is a streamer on Twitch that was responding to a different situation. Afterwards, this new meme format was created. Felt this scenario fit the format well, so was simply meant to bring everyone a laugh.

I’ve done easily 12 runs and only seen one as well. Something seems up.
---
What? Of course you can
---
fear ward racial lasts 10 minutes and is on a 30sec cooldown. it's stupidly powerful in pve and pvp. i play on a pvp server and the amount of times i've sailed right into an instance portal camped by the opposing faction without getting ganked is hilarious. warriors/priests insta fear me but it has no effect, only eats the buff. i love it
---
Hey everyone! Look at this guy! He played on a PServer and does 20 more dps in his raids! I bet his guild clears MC in under an hour! Oh what? Nobody is impressed.
---
Just hit level 50 don't know if I'll make it send help
---
I've just grown attached to my +shadow power greens stop tryin to give me purple +int/stam pieces!
---
shut up dagger ears
---
AoE tanking is a thing? Perhaps with a tank wearing a two hander or going DW fury. Otherwise your tools are demo shout, battle shout, and thunderclap. All of which give garbage threat now.
---
Oh man I’m scared lol. Any word on how far away this is? I’m only level 36 and I’m getting nervous.
---
Never saw the tome at satyr. Saw the big room and endboss tome multiple times in a day
---
Check out cloth prices on your AH and then farm whatever humanoids drop the ones that sell well. Various satyrs in Felwood for example.
---
that would be an example of a very steady reliable and simple method. Elementals that drop some shit that crafters / transmuters need is another.
---
if he gets logged out for inactivity he'll just log in alone at sea with no history as to why haha
---
This person is trolling, this cant be true ;)
---
While I agree, dev blogs would make everything researchable by the time it's out. Obviously that's only if they follow OSRS to the T. If they just voted on general ideas and not full details like gear and stats it'd be nice.
---
Same thing with pre-raid dagger rogues. Can actually do good dps but you get so much threat if you push hard..
---
Yeah it's kind of hilarious how much easier it is for alliance. I learned this back in vanilla actually. My main raid guild was horde in 05. I did tons of content with them up until Naxx. Then we died so half of us rerolled alliance on Altar of Storms. We cleared everything SO much faster and threat was not even an issue thanks to Salvation. 
---
That said, I'd still never trade Windfury as a warrior.
---
I finished thee over this weekend.  Took me quite a while but this worked best.

* Trapped Simone
---
* Kite precious - kill with serpent sting and max rank arcane shot
---
* When Simone catches up just scatter or concussion or silence depending on situation. Keep on pet until dead. 
---
* Simone is a breeze solo - melee her down and keep her wing clipped so that when she starts to cast you can strafe our and silence.  If  I got low on health I would scatter run out and bandage. 
---
Also pot as mana pot early so the cools down is up when u need it. I used 2.  I used mongoose pot and grilled squid. No nature pots. Just keep you aspect of wild up.
---
You don't really get much honor from killing someone ten levels below you, and none at all past a certain point. It will be fine. So there isn't a strong incentive, or any, to gank low levels, besides fun, which people already do. You'll still see the same asshole hunters and rogues ganking lower level people during quests as usual.
---
Use a spellstone for the memes
---
The people who play WoW are generally massive trolls. A significant portion just fucking suck. Have to get used to it and go about your business.
---
Lol cool I was so confused
---
Noob healer shoudlve just played Rdruid and innervated himself or eat between pulls 
---
/s
---
Its rather to slow since most 60s are quitting cause they all done the content there is
---
Ya, they did. Most of the alliance left because they were sick of the imbalance, the problem is horde didn't leave on the same level and it's not going to be fucked come next patch.
---
Ah nice! Now I want one ;(
---
Hardly an exploit. He's just being clever with pathing. 
---
I like this kind of stuff, always interesting to see how this sort of thing is done. Thanks for the vid!
---
Got my last piece yesterday! Week 3
---
Blizzard didn’t want to release classic, private servers popularity forced them to. Not at all surprising this was their response at the time.
---
Aye, can confirm. Got my own 8/8 yesterday, took 3 long weeks! Well worth it
---
Since nobody mentioned it, there is no items from marks of honor. It's rank only (and bg faction rep). It's not like in BC that you "buy" items from honor and marks. So for the first items you need to gain r7 which will take quite some time.
---
All the memes aside. Will it for real even be possible to level? I'm 53 now and if I'm going to be camped and killed every 5 minute it's not even playable. Should I come back in 6 months when bgs are released?
---
If I'm not mistaken by this patch the BG marks were removed which makes getting rep extremely difficult with the factions. Like... VERY difficult. Apart from AV that is.
---
52 Warrior here.
---
I wonder if this anxiety I feel over this phase 2 deal is just because I suck balls at PvP on my warrior. I have a 40 SPriest and 28 Warlock I'm leveling as well, and I'd feel much more comfortable with PvP playing either of those. I'm considering putting the warrior on the back burner for a bit when Phase 2 hits to level those, and perhaps come back when the initial WPvP honor hype dies down or primarily switches to BGs when Phase 3 hits; though I don't actually know how that will all go down.
---
Do they really get HK from 12 levels lower?

Sure if you compare your spec to fire mages it comes up short.  Frequently fire mages are the guys who can theorycraft and optimize without a flawed blueprint like icy veins or a google sheet.

Shoutout from Remulos. The only reason I chose to play PVE was because Arugal was full on release day.

Also didn't Rag have like 4x his current hitpoints at launch, compared to the patch classic is based on? Fucker doesn't even submerge for my guild.

Totally agree and it's insane you got downvoted for saying this. "Well researched game" haha such nerds! Look at any sport being played in the world right now and tell me that isn't heavily researched. Or any other popular game like DOTA or Fortnite where people have things down to a science.
---
The bottom line of Classic is that it's a social game meant for epic group questing and adventure. And it happens to be brilliant at this. It's one of the few games I've ever played that got the old school D&amp;D RPG feeling down perfectly.
---
Problem is to go goblin you either have to level it twice or skip gnomish which just isnt worth it.
---
even if they did bring phase 2 out around xmas or even the new year you still wouldn't be level cap at the rate you are going (it just get's slower)
---
Also, it's phase 2, just some world bosses and the honour system.
---
oh man believe me i know you can be sure im hitting that like button very fast ;)
---
I usually don't post, haven't seen this discussed so thought I'd say something
---
How is it always different? Do Paladins sometimes not have HoJ? lol
---
They still are
---
How bad is phase 2 going to be? I’m a level 36 horde player on rattlegore and I feel like this is going to ruin the game for me. I thought I’d be further along by now when I picked a PvP server but now I think I’m just going to get smashed.
---
so corpse run into the dungeon if you have to. why are you people so fucking dumb?
---
No
---
The vocal minority would have you believe everyone has a geared out level 60 since September or something when it's just not the case at all, most are casual players.
---
wait what
---
You know that as a warrior you can't kill any class other than warrior on your own, right?
---
It's a thing, you aren't pulling the whole instance, but 2-6 is easily possible while leveling using arms. With the standard requirement of 2-3 sec before DPS to start you have time to charge+sweeping strikes, tab rend/thunderclap to build enough aggro to sustain until DPS starts AOE damage. 
---
If the DPS gives you the time to gather/go through initial rotation you guys should be able to aoe down packs and chain pull. The mobs should die fast enough that a decent healer shouldn't oom after 1 pull.
---
Yes, it’s more of a mindless collectathon now with guild drama and time being the obly real hurdles to overcome. 
---
I guess there are a few things left to be tried but chances are that someone else will best you to it and post a video about it before you even had the idea.
---
AoE tanking is a thing? Where? Since the only AoE a warrior has is Demo shout and thunderclap, both of which does fuckall for threat.
---
Sure I can tabtarget and apply sunder armor and shit. But I cant do that without Rage, which I get by being attacked, which I'm not since I didnt get to build aggro.
---
Firemaw is Gehennas but better balanced but also less hardcore. Overall population is negligibly less on Firemaw. Think rerolling on Gehennas now during p2 is a suicide mission. Wont be easy on firemaw but its gonna be doable. Every other server pales in comparison to these 2.
---
monkaGIGA
---
Yea if the healer has to heal themselves it's wasted Mana and bad. All party members should be prepared to pull adds of healer.
---
That's how games are. People find an efficient way to do things, they do it.
---
What do you mean? Phase 2 only introduces wpvp
---
As long as you fill your bags with arrows in addition to your quiver, swapping them in as you use them, you'll be fine.
---
Mage
---
I mean, its partially that, but also the fact that it is well known that horde have better pvp racials and alliance better pve ones.
---
and when the classic mentality attracts the more hardcore people, it is bound to happen.
---
the only thing blizzard could have done is to release BGs alongside P2, but then the nochanges people would scream about it.
---
dont think so, 
---
now that shadorealm is announced bfa will be part of the main game and be worth nothing
---
i think they changed there minds
---
Mom's basement?
---
I feel they can make it so only the one who hits the civilian will get the Dk. Would be more beneficial for the game. Feels like theres only a downside to the group dk no real prevention
---
I think it’s worth to level gnome, build gnome stuff and relearn goblin
---
Congrats from a fellow yojamban whose casual guild will be doing rag for the first time tonight

Gb2retail noob.
---
What sorcery is this? Is this actually a bug? If not I need to find that macro lol
---
It shouldn't "ruin the game". It might be obnoxious. World PVP is a big part of why people picked a PVP server in the first place.
---
If you're really worried about it, just run dungeons to 60, or quest in horde-controlled areas.
---
i never saw even one dropping, fck me
---
Hahahahaha yikes dude
---
Reminded me of a tank from BC who compared one of the etherium dungeons to sticking his dick in a meat grinder. Good times.

It was either shadow labs or Auchenai crypts but can’t member which
---
#TARGETED HARASSMENT
---
This is a given at this point. WSG on Christmas day easy.
---
theres retail for you.
---
Well... feel better now you have got that out of your system?
---
You're too low to be any value to 60s, but you'll have plenty of level 40ish players willing to corpse camp you for the small amount of honour they'll get.
---
At 36 it's at least 2 or 3 days of played time to get back to that level, and if that's what you've achieved since launch then I would guess it's going to take a couple of months for you to get back there on a PvP realm. Either embrace the shadow and take the ganking now so you can hand it out to someone else when you reach 60, or bite the bullet and reroll for a trouble free levelling experience. Your call.
---
I have a warrior main and want to roll an alt to level and gold farm later. I want to pick a ranged class - what is best?
---
I think warriors are more fun, but it's completely subjective. There's no 'more fun, less fun' answer. Hunters are easier to level, if that matters.
---
I am not convinced camping instances or raiding every 50-60 zone will be worthwhile for honor. It’s all speculation at this point.
---
I have a geared up char on a hot PvP server and I am not too worriee about leveling up an alt on another one. 
---
Getting ganked is usually not that bad. Doing the BRM instances will almost certainly involve some corpseruns now but c’est la vie.
---
I definitely spent way too long yelling "For the Horde" from the top of the IF gate while no one was noticing, but this was really a super fun trip!
---
Dailies hell was a plague in TBC too, unfortunately. It was still nothing compared to the isle of gold at tbc endgame and wrath though, for sure. 
---
I actually did enjoy them both at the time, but there was really no excuse for quel'danas nor the argent tournament and everything they paved the way for.
---
There are always multiple slow points on any playthrough. Maybe you are running around handing in things or out of quests and having to mob grind a while. Just keep chugging along, you'll get through it. 
---
I blazed up until 45 on my current toon, but 45-49 have been real slow because I dont like to do dungeons over and over. I'm like 2 bars from 50, when I'll go to ungoro and sunken temple. That's an easy level or two and then plaguelands. Bet ill be 54-55 before I feel it slow down again. At that point I'll just grind preraid bis and work on auunements and gathering mats for the warlock epic mount.
---
Mate it's.lassic you have like 5 keybinds
---
If you wanna pvp you need engi. Its simple as that. If you can make your alt your gold generator that d be the best of both worlds.

Yep, I just quit. I didn't have time to level past 40 so far and it was already terrible with 60s corpse camping lowbies and stopping questing zone wide for hours and even days. I've never seen one 60 from my faction come to defend. Not once. It was fun while it lasted. I hope this doesn't kill server population balance. Neither faction wants that. Be careful what you wish for.

Bit of a formula to it.

I'll say the one thing that ideas surprised the most about raiding was all the extra buffs.  Flasks, elixirs, juju, DM tribute, Ony head, food... the list goes on and on.  I'm enjoying raiding.  I do not, however, know wtf is going on all the time.  I just follow orders, use buffs when I can, and press "chain heal" a bunch.
---
We were supposed to get Vanilla. Instead we got overtuned 1.12 gameplay right from the start. When the game launched classes were broken. Racials weren't working. It wasn't a situation where anyone could  level to 60 in three days. 
---
I would love for Blizzard to bring back the original talent trees but I get that that's a lot to ask. But launching with the most optimized version really devalued the content. Players didn't even need the improved itemization gear Blizzard introduced in Dire Maul to faceroll Molten Core. They could have approximated the original state of classes and added functionality with each phase. Or at the very damn least add a temporary buff to mobs so players didn't just carve through them.
---
That's the problem with JokerD's run. It shouldn't have been possible. They didn't need layering to cheese the game since they were starting Day 1 with the best version of the fastest leveling class. The layering and raid xp bug abuse is just adding insult. The real injury was that Blizzard didn't invest enough resources to protect the integrity of their game. They could be raking in sooooo much more money right now and their shortsightness is going to cost them a lot more subs from people in the minority factions on pvp realms in Phase 2.
---
Why is everyone’s dps so low
---
Wow. So much dumb in this thread
---
Private servers owned by no lifers and funded by virgins have run more stable during large fights in open world. You can pick a battle you want to fight with spell batching, but there should be no reasonable person defending blizzard servers.
---
Yeah you're probably right
---
Other DPS being terrible isn't an excuse for using a subpar spec.
---
*"HELER UUM? WAT? SOUNDS LIKE A HELER PRUBLEM TO ME"*

*"BORK SMASH"*

Rattlegore? If so you jumped after me, got the heads up you were there and bubbled before I jumped.
---
Technically true, but I've seen enough crappy Ony raids to trust people to play above the content.
---
Run the dungeons you enjoy with friends / guildies and greed roll any drops. Complete your T0 set for the pretty town look even if not preBiS. Farm rep. Professions. Make epic mount money. Fish. Stock up on mats for raids. Stock up on mats to sell for raids or for PvP. Explore the map.
---
Etc.
---
I’ll be damned. u/JesusWasaDonger giving me tips about maturity. Nice.
---
Imagine losing a duel to a 5 year old
---
So you ganked lowbies, then got killed by their mains and hid in shadow form until they left, and finally laughed at them in chat? Uhh, Great job...
---
Somebody doesn't know about queuing heroic strike to make offhand hit 100% of the time with just soft hit cap.
---
We also clear mc in under 1.5 hrs from first trash pull to rag dead. I think my guild tanks are competent.
---
I’m level 30 and am constantly getting killed by level 50+ Horde players, so I’m okay with this!
---
Recount is bugged
---
Alliance had a huge advantage in almost every encounter in Vanilla. AQ was when Horde had it a little easier with nature resist totem. After years of not being able to balance the factions they just gave Horde paladins. Sure alliance got Shaman but they didn't give anywhere near the raid support paladins did.
---
Level 48 and I don't think I'm  gonna make it. I thought I was almost done but then a bunch of people told me I'm like just barely past halfway...

If you are an Undead rogue, that's kinda what you signed up for.

How often do you tell the fourth guy from the left to run, Forest, run?

&gt;First off the word is threat.

&gt;People also forgot bosses couldn’t be taunted or that taunt could even miss because that has been out of the game for like 10 years.

That's also another - you say "remember", but for many this is a new game, and there's no reason why a taunt should be resisted or other creatures be immune. So to say "it's retail's fault that made people dumb" isn't really a good reason for it, it just gave very basic different expectations.
---
&gt;People understood this back in vanilla and tbc and it wasn’t a problem.
---
looking at the memes no, it was not the absolute case.
---
It's like everything is reserved.
---
I thought the Shaman Dream was to get Rag's hammer and 1 hot WF proc someone...?
---
Yes, PvP servers will be hell unless you have a large group of people willig to quest with you.
---
The final zones to lvl up to 60 are popular farming spots and kills 50+ give honour to 60s so people lvling will absolutely get ganked. I'm planning to finish lvling mostly in instances but DM and blackrock mountain will still probably be a shitfest to get into
---
Unless you can get rank 11+ gear, no.
---
I play as often as life will allow and I hit 47 a few days ago. Holy shit @ the people with multiple 60s. And holy shit at the stash of items some people have. They are sitting on thousands of gold in twink items. I love this game but I have a lot of work and family shit to do. I wish I could be 13 again :P
---
Never appreciated how amazing this game is til it was gone. Never thought I could have WoW back.
---
Arugal OCE
---
For gold farming, the answer is always mage.
---
This is so perfect.
---
Anyone know of an addon, that allows you to note groups of items for easy bank deposits/retrieval of said item groups?
---
dude brm is already a shitfest to get into with MC raids. CORPSE RUN IN.
---
Its not that bad but yes from 50 on it takes abit longer
---
Having 2-3 warriors using ravager is the new META.
---
GET INTO THE CAR SON, YOU'RE IN FOR A WILD RIDE.

I did it as 52 ret paladin
---
Eye of rend
---
Orc.  To the alliance credit, they aren’t racist. They kill everything pretty indiscriminately on my server.
---
In a scenario with no mage your healer's downing manna biscuits which cost 2.5 gold per stack. Your tank's looking at 1-2g repairs on a perfect run where he never dies. Both of 'em don't farm near as efficiently as you, but they manage.
---
You do you, of course. But a DPS that actually carries their weight? They stand out. They get invited to future runs. Runecloth is friggin' cheap, my dude.
---
Good luck farming your pre-bis set xd
---
Dont want to feel left behind? ReTuRn To ReTaIl
---
Nobody cares about You :)
---
I got the impression it was just a superficial number squish prompted by the fact that there are so many levels where you aren't getting new abilities. I wouldn't be surprised if the expansion after Shadowlands took people to 70.

I mean I'm a very casual player and I hit 60 well over a month ago, along with a level 40, so yes
---
I think I did this to a mage porting outside onyxia's lair earlier... His spell finished casting as I ambushed him and he disappeared then his corpse popped back from out of nowhere lmao.
---
Are you level 60 though
---
As a tank, if the mage got improved blizzard spec, then its fine. The mobs will often be dead before reaching the casters anyways.
---
Name checks out
---
Search for james guide or anything similar, also the addon questie helps a lot. It does take some of the ”magic” of questing and discovering quests away. You could just read the part of lvl 20-30 and get some inspiration for jumping between zones doing only certain quests at a time and not the whole zone. And that way gather a bunch of quests that are active at the same time instead of, and I know this feeling, running around looking for one specific time for a whole playsession.
---
mining/eng sorry forgot to include that

Meh, just do what you want (unless you can't cause your job does it that way or something). I hate snake case with a passion, so all the Python I write uses camel case despite the odious tyranny of PEP8.

On PvP servers you have to suffer through lvl 40-60 to be able to gank other people later. If you don't intend to gank other people, you'll just suffer for nothing. 
---
On a PvE server you'll occasionally meet people with PvP-flag on. That happens actually more often than "honorable" fights on PvP servers. Raids on the cities are still a thing. Duels are still a thing. BGs will work just the same. You won't miss out on anything if you go PvE (except ganking). You'll still get to PvP, but with the people who actually want PvP.
---
I find justice useful with mobs my lvl or higher that flee, preventing them from pulling larger nearby packs.
---
What?
---
Played a ton of vanilla and pvped extensively. Timing of skills in 1v1 was such an important thing. I have more examples of batching screwing all sorts of things up. My favorite maining a hunter is you can perform a raptor strike for damage on people after they hit your trap and still get frozen because they will batch at the same time. All sorts of shit like this exists and it looks like the solution is just to re learn the new pvp meta and timings with batching included, but its definitely anything but vanilla like.
---
As somebody who never played wow before classic, why is it so important to be lvl 60 before phase 2 drops?
---
I'm only lvl 40 and I'm not even concerned about phase 2. Should I be? I figured I would just keep playing as normal and I'll hit 60 in my own time.
---
As a horde player you should be safe on most servers horde has huge number advantage. I am on the same spot as you (level 43) but on the alliance side. If it's really that hart to quest I'll try to focus on instances...If I can't even enter the instances then I don't know...maybe I'll take a break
---
Are we just gonna ignore the raidcomp of 15 healers and 25 dps this guy suggested?
---
Hmm, good to know it still spawns at least. Maybe i've just gotten insanely unlucky.
---
(It doesn't properly show affliction DPS)
---
Quite a saturated area during peak times though. Unfortunately these are the only times I can get on!
---
Its worth it but its expensive.
---
Yeah... no druids or warlocks?  Coming from a warlock and a former druid player back in vanilla... that's not a huge loss. :P  Although if it's anything like my guild, druid and warlock gear is the only thing that drops, so... ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
It will be a bit more killing the first week ir so. I think things will be back to normal after that.
---
End level quest hubs might have more pvp though.
---
I think everyone defines casual/hardcore for themselves somehow
---
Since no one has mentioned it yet... Definitely get natures swiftness over elemental mastery. NS is your only "oh shit" button for group content, and is really helpful for solo pve anyway. Otherwise, i really don't think manatide is that necessary for standard 5 man content
---
Thrash blade mainland / vanquisher offhand. End of story
---
Yeahhhhhh boiii
---
I’m just trying to do a quick Rend run. I work in the morning and I have a small window of time to do it.
---
These window licking ass-goblins that just sit at BRS entrance are just griefing. There’s no gain to it except to make us corpse run for an extra half hour
---
DING
---
DED
---
If you have the time to lvl a toon to 60 and another to 40 in 2 months of classic, you are definitely not casual
---
Proto-Dad Gamer comment. Notice my kid, she is so smart guys, it made it!!!!
---
Or take the longer but safer way by going north through tristfall glade past sfk. It takes longer but the mobs are lower level.
---
Can't be killed if you kill them first.
---
A smart or well-geared guild can usually off-tank 4 adds each while burning down Garr, then take their time pulling the adds off of the OT's one by one.  Little trickier but then you don't have to panic if you lose a lock or two during the chaos of battle.
---
Sweeping strikes + whirlwind +cleave + sunder is NOT the same as
---
Sunder Tab Sunder Tab Sunder Tab Sunder
---
Yeah, it's a combination of it being a game pretty much everyone has completed back in the day, along with a substantial percentage of players having completed it routinely on private servers the last decade too.
---
Potentially unpopular opinion, but I think the best thing they could have done would have been to remove debuff caps while doubling all HP in raids and trippling boss HP. 
---
We were never going to recreate the good old days down to the T. Ragnaros was always going to get instagibbed by the same people who instagibbed him upon every fresh private server reset the last decade.

---
Ok in this situation with this time schedule etc I would’ve rolled on a pve server tbh. PvP takes a lot of spontaneous time commitment
---
Why didn’t you just drop group inside gnomer and get auto-ported?
---
I will personally skip this month. Not necessarily cause of phase 2, but I played since launch and Im full bis on my warrior, I got a bit bored. I won't have wpvp fun with my fury warrior anyway.
---
Ask people that have 4 level 60 already. For them he might be a casual.
---
Oh shit I played on altar of storms too back in the day. Was a Tauren hunter named Prozac in the guild Eye of the Dragon. Didn’t even get through BWL tho lol
---
I had my fun. I played at the same pace I did TBC/Wotlk and there is just less content. Now I am just waiting for more.
---
Well they are dead wrong hahah
---
He's not missing out any more than you're missing a brain.
---
Not to mention curses, which are the best utility warlocks bring!
---
But phantom blade looks so cool on the back :/
---
I agree with this. Although 50-60 takes more cap then 1-50, running BRD for my BiS items leveled me up so fast. By the time I had all the items I wanted (except Savage glad chest) I was high enough to do scholo/strath.
---
Do you still wait on retail for tank to get aggro or prepot and start casting as he tries to go in? It’s not an argument it’s a fact. The threat gens are different so much so that there is no need to wait on retail. Even in fights I have to move the boss I don’t have an issue on my retail tank, dps is free to go as soon as dbm timer it’s zero and should already have precast so their spell goes off at the same time. There is no threat issue on retail what so ever.
---
fdghdfgwre24r23
---
The bloodbath you're describing is _exactly_ what I signed up for.
---
After Naxx has been cleared for a good while, I want to see a “fresh” classic re-release where all the dungeons are fine tuned, gear is improved, and raids are far more difficult (and MAYBE slight changes to talents / classes)
---
But you as a tank WILL get blamed 95% of the time
---
I never yelled at somebody for that or never would. This sub is way more toxic than the game.
---
Yeah. I don't enjoy PvP, but my friends do, so I ended up on a PvP server. I am not looking forward to Phase 2. I just want to quest and farm herbs for my epic mount and run some instances.
---
And I believe it's spelled London, not Landon.
---
Hey it was a bit crazy back then for sure but since we've been raiding and doing all the endgame content you'd actually be surprised how we've changed.
---
last night I had a little check and firemaw was the realm with the largest que nothing was even close. if u want the busiest eu realm go firemaw
---
Rez and go somewhere else?
---
That's a good point but afaik the only sword upgrade would be Vis'kag until P3. I cant expect to get lucky on 3 weapon drops in a row \^\^ i think i'll Keep that axe for a while
---
Stoneform bros unite!
---
I mean if it’s a pally tank bubble him :)
---
You don’t get honor for every kill, it’s like XP. If you are higher lvl than them by too much, nothing.
---
ah yes the google.com machine. thank you
---
56 warrior here. I feel like I need 6 hours playtime per level WITH rested bonus..  won’t make it with a few hours play time each other day.
---
It’s inefficient for ammo but it doesn’t reduce your damage until you get aimed shot. Once you have aimed shot, then faster weapons become worse.
---
Can someone give me a number crunch real quick on the chances grandpa is still alive?
---
Fun fact, it’s their daughter
---
Might be beneficial to go 7-8% hit and use the sword in MH for yellow hits. Considering you will have fewer glancing blows.
---
U might get rage starved though.
---
Female dwarf master race
---
Yeah I've read about that. But I'm wondering how much of a difference it'll make opposing to 9% hit. Do you have any Info on that?
---
get gud
---
God, you sound like such a miserable person. I almost felt sorry for you, but I feel like your in-laws kind of deserve my pity more from the way you’re projecting yourself onto the OP.
---
&gt;I can't wait for the bloodbath. 
---
Fuck yeah.
---
Essence of water from the water eles go for 15-20g each depending on server and are actually quite fun to farm. 
---
One of the best spots for them is in felwood and is like its own mini battleground so usually it'll be you + a member of your faction vs 2 enemy players basically playing king of the hill where the reward is good gold per hour
---
If you're a hunter though might be better just solo dmn tribute runs
---
Hit 40, realized none of the friends I'd rolled on a PvP server to play with were on when I could play, realized I was getting bored with leveling, and quit. I can live with the occasional gank, but corpse running to keep doing something I'm not having fun with in the first place? Nah.
---
What does seal of the earth mean
---
what time you get on?
---
bastrd
---
I think my brother was 7 when I started playing wow (during tbc) and I was a few years older but we shared room and he would watch me play. Eventually he made a little gnome on my account that he loved and it really let him get immersed as a little dude running around the world of WoW adults...
---
anyways fast forward some months and he made it to level 28 and was still super into it, taking his time and having fun. But we had an argument, and I was a cruel son of a bitch. I don't know what it was about, but I went and deleted his character. 
---
It's 12 years later and occasionally it pops into my head and it's like a stab in my heart. I still feel terrible about it.
---
He's like 20 now and still plays WoW, we're not playing together currently but we've leveled to 60 on a pserver together.
---
No summons is rough tho
---
honestly as a mage i make 95% of my gold from dungeons. i have epic mount, freezing band, cainwynn neck, chromatic cloak, arcanist belt that were all bought with gold. thats like 2500g right there. it helps to be a good player tho.
---
If you can play in early morning I suggest water eles in EPL.  I got 3 essences/h as a holy priest farming those.
---
I'm like 95% sure it was a madeup claim, so thanks for raising the obvious questions and ruining it for us.
---
from 53-57 seemed so fast for me. I guess coz i stoped fcking around and only quested.
---
It's...like they're begging to be food!
---
Yep. The guild is dope now. Lots of great people helping each other out, raiding and having fun. Happy to be a member.
---
Second this. U will definitely wont to bounce between locations alot in classic doind half level here, half level there. Qestie will help alot as u will easy see average levels for quest and be will be able to pick best zone rotation for your current level. Also, dont  pickand try to complete all the wide lvl range  quests in bootybay  for example, it ends much faster to do some travel and pick green/yellow quests on another location, thay u can complete without drinking after every mob.
---
p.s.tauren no speak english well:)
---
It's jsut that all sorts of people are this way not just retail people. We had these problems on pservers and most people didn't even play retail, and we had these issues back in the day as well
---
Imagine the feeling when you hit 60 on all 5!
---
warlocks are huge. banish is fantastic in MC and curse of elemental is like 20% dps per mage
---
U can download prat and it will keep lengthy chat logs for backup in these situations, and I usually take screenshots of important rolls in raids too. That being said, it's SM.... It's not exactly the be all and end all of the game, there are thousands of runs to SM every day lol. Just ignore them and move on 😊
---
why brag ?
---
Yea it’s pretty interesting actually. Rogue is great since you already have stealth, backstab, and gouge. I think casters are generally bad since you don’t get any crowd control yet. But actually I kinda think warrior might dominate for this bracket just because of charge— it’s the only distance closing ability available to anyone at this level, and half the time in these fights I am chasing a gnome across the map and hoping I can catch him before he reaches the guards.
---
Yes because so many guilds were killing rag pre-submerge before BWL dropped, clearly they were just more skilled back then
---
It's funny you say that because I have a crackpot theory: Valdhir used to put these up much faster but the comments went from things like yours to "I can't keep up, you're submitting too fast!" (whereupon my theory is that he intentionally slowed down).
---
Obviously a bit crazy because he likely just took a break or found his preferred rhythm.
---
The way I see it, if you’re sick of the slowness, the objective needs to shift.
---
Doing dungeons for gear, farming in a level appropriate zone for gold (and fighting whatever comes at you), or focusing on quests for the fun of the hunt/adventure.
---
These things should spice up the perspective.  Also, going to different zones keeps it spicy and fresh!
---
that was the idea fromvery start. happy I pulled it off.
---
Though even if you get glancing blows up to full damage they can't crit.
---
You're wrong. No way will people have all the turnins ready to open AQ40 the day it's released.
---
Smolderweb!
---
Hahaha you guys just made my day 😅 so mf accurate
---
They were introduced in naxx
---
Ah, okay. Ty.
---
This is how I dinged 60 as well! Also, same profile except mine is a newborn haha
---
It's generally understood that `/roll`s are towards a chest if one is literally right there, common etiquette does not require you to announce a chest for a roll to count. The fact that the priest rolled means he was probably aware of what it was for, and the fact that he never questioned it ("what are we rolling for?") afterward further cements that. By all means, his first roll "counted" and only in his little world does his rule apply.
---
That said, it's common courtesy to announce it if someone doesn't roll, since it's not always obvious to everyone. So I would say it was your bad for looting the chest without asking the warlock to roll first, however giving him the option to roll afterward is a perfectly acceptable way to fix that in my book.
---
I 100% agree, but dont worry about it, just enjoy the game lol. I don't know any of the BIS stuff, and I actually avoid all the online guides (spoilers) and just play through the game. I'm having a good time :) Hope you can too!
---
You really don't get it.
---
Do whatever the fuck you want, this game can be enjoyed in hundreds of different ways.
---
But if you aren't going to push to be 60 over two months after release, you've no right to complain that you're behind the curve of players.
---
60 dungeons, molten core and onyxia will still be run in phase 3. You will even be able to complete BWL with everyone else.  You're just getting arsey because you're realising that classic doesn't have welfare systems.
---
This is exceptional.
---
I think you should just not lose people and kill him before submerge. I am in a pretty casual raising guild for a month or so and I never saw him submerge.
---
Just try using more consunables like greater fire ress pot.
---
I would've taken the delivery fee out of the gold. Bitch I aint paying that 30 copper, you pay for it.
---
Side entrance, its the entrance that requires the key to enter.
---
Usually just RP walking past works. But today I slew four level 3 multi boxing priests just by doing /chicken.
---
I met the wall at 42, started a new char and at around 20 I figured out that fuck no. I'm not gonna run around again with no mount doing the same quests :P so I just powered through and have not looked back since :)
---
Ah, this was alot more fun.
---
I've had 8 year old kids talk better shit then that on xbox. You need more PvP in your life.
---
Once we had a ?? Paladin come through and wreck us, yeah. I think to prevent this I want to organize some kinda of bounty on my head that is only achievable by players 6 and under.
---
For me classic is as good as I remembered it from 2005 when I played vanilla.
---
The only which is annoying is the community and their modern retail behaviour (this and that locked/reserved, spellcleave only, aoe grinding everything etc.)
---
I still play almost daily at least a little bit (on the way getting my 3rd char to 60 now for more twinkraids) and I still enjoy it to run raids with my friends and guild and I still enjoy making 40 people raids and world pvp, taking over certain villages and trying to keep alive...
---
There are still soooo many people (on herod we frequently have queues up to 6k 3-4hours) so I am glad for every person who doesnt like classic and is just playing it because of the hype who leaves now.
---
Its annoying to log in and stay into the game on raiddays several hours prior over smartphone just so you can be part of the raid and the more people leave who arent really into classic, the better it is.
---
90+ dm east 4 boss kills still no book :(
---
Robes of arcana for warlock quest
---
Moonsteel broadsword for that weirdo Jarl on the witch hill in Dustwallow marsh
---
You won the chest roll, end of story.
---
On our first Rag kill RL told us not to use any consumables and not to waste any long CDs as we were just going to go for a test run. Rag died. "Oh, okay then."
---
Is the 'side entrance' inside of the instance? Or is the side entrance actually an instance entrance behind a locked door? Can a rogue picklock it?
---
You don’t need the key urself! It’s enough if atleast one person in the group got the key
---
Phantom blade and skullforge reaver for sheer intimidation value.
---
People overblown the world pvp all the time. So many times I just did things together with hordies and lvl 60s just ran past me while leveling. I died a couple of times while doing every quest in STV.
---
I already planned to join on your original post, then I forgot. Now I'm determined to send you a friend request on my next day off ;)
---
Keep dem troll bredren safe mon!
---
The warning does not pop up for alts.
---
Please, the devs were pressured into that nochanges horseshit by the pservers turds that wanted to exploit the same shit they've been exploiting on every server reset for a decade. There's no 'preserving' anything. Endgame is trivial, PvP servers were ruined 2 weeks in by faction imbalance, Heroic Strike exploit etc etc. The game's already a joke.
---
You have to keep in mind that unlike the caster table which is a 2-roll system, the melee system is a 1-roll. So the fact that glances can't crit doesn't affect your crit chance, unless you're crit capped (which you won't be while leveling).
---
&gt; Of course PvP servers in Classic will be the same. All the spiteful, maladjusted subhumans from pservers have already ruined them.  We've already seen skulls camping roofs in Darkshire, Gadget, Booty etc. Faction imbalance set in mere weeks after launch. Did any of this behaviour change? 
---
So... non pserver players don't gank? Non pserver players would've not looked at racials and balanced the factions 50/50?
---
Momma must be so proud.
---
Well geared guilds actually tank all ads on one tank and burst garr. After that they finish adds with some people and some people continue clearing trash
---
Give pvp a chance it is fun, try to party with your friends and hunt the other factions etc.
---
https://youtu.be/FUsF8weJJWs
---
That is why they need to post the screenshot of the whispered winning bid, with timestamps. Of course that would probably ruin their "Loot council masquerading as DKP" system.
---
Had to join some adventurers in order to vanquish Ragnaros and Onyxia. Worry not my gnome mage is holding &lt;Dwarfpriest&gt; until my return.
---
Man you got destroyed in this exchange.
---
I like ganking, but I still rolled on pve, because I don’t like getting ganked. If you don’t like ganking then it is not the best to play on pvp seerver.
---
Edgemasters with axe is a must for good dps. Every other fury war with 305 weapon skill will beat ur ass even without that axe (while fighting a 63level boss).... 308 is soft cap and is nice to have that. So axe+edgemasters is really a must if u are playing serious. Its not all about hit, but there is more damage from glancing blows. At 307 u will hit for aprox +30% more with glancings, which occur 40% of the time of white attacks.
---
3% hit and +30% more damage from glancings in one item is huge and is bis up to Naxx. Must for non human/orcs PvE warriors and Non-sword human warriors and non-axe orc warriors. If you have sword equipped in MH don´t bother with edgemasters at all. But all and all is nice to have them in bank in case you drop that axe from Ony which is bis for PvE wars atm.

---
Dont downvote if u know shit people and get your edgemasters if you wanna play on serious note. If you are casual dont bother with it. 400g price on my server is a joke and you should get it. I remember paying over 1000g for these on various pservers.

Right.

seriously these posts are so lame

What’s a fun class to play starting with a friend who’s new to the game? As in, which classes have the most fun synergy together? We’ll be playing Ally so Sham’s off the table
---
If they didn’t roll or read the rolls that’s their fault mate, you did nothing wrong
---
Fuck the warlock for not being observant enough that the entire party had rolled, and fuck the priest for trying to ninja loot the necklace by rolling again.
---
so youre just gonna fuckin remind everyone every few weeks?
---
[Yes](https://youtu.be/ZXsQAXx_ao0)
---
You can min/max just fine and not being a raider, I have a hard time committing to certain raid times, real life often gets in the way.
---
But I’ll min/max just the same as a raider, it’s just that my selection of gear is smaller that theirs.

downvote them
---
45% = 100 - (20+25+10) chance for other things to happen. Only 'full' white hits can be crits.
---
so, say you have 50% crit chance:
---
of your 100% chance to hit,
---
20% is miss
---
10% is dodge
---
25% is glancing
---
45% is crit (assuming you have 50% crit tooltip).
---
Until you lower the upper 3 categories, you can't get more effective crit (as opposed to tooltip crit), because it rolls top-down. Easiest way is to gain hit%;
---
15% miss
---
10% dodge
---
25% glance   - These 3 categories add up to 50%.
---
50% crit.
---
**For the stats you gave above, ON WHITE HITS,** 
---
13% miss
---
5% dodge
---
15% glancing (I think; I'd have to check the exact number at 305 skill, its 40% at 300)
---
25.45% crit
---
41.55% regular hit.
---
As you're nowhere near the 'crit cap', this shouldn't be an issue for you. Generally warriors don't run into this as a problem at all, it's usually rogues/hunter's who deck themselves in full Agility gear.
---
I am leveling with my wife. Were lvl 35. I am preparing to die a lot lvl 40💪+ to say the least. We thought about this before we started and are playing Druid Rogue 😂
---
*giggity*
---
Warrior MT for my guild. Battle Shout is 65 threat per friendly unit hit with it, applied to all enemies around you. So for a group of 5 without hunter or warlock pets, that's 325 threat instantly. My normal AoE opener is charge --&gt; def stance --&gt; Bloodrage --&gt; Battle Shout --&gt; Demo Shout --&gt; zerk stance --&gt; zerk rage --&gt; WW --&gt; def stance --&gt; tab target. Works like a charm.
---
It MIGHT not be, because if you look at the addon API you have a LOT of different events to attach to, and it might be possible, but probably not with a simple macro.
---
So that's why that warlock was being an asshole and constantly tagging the elite turtle from me and not letting me group up with him just for the kill
---
When I play I play to complete stuff.
---
I have 100 percent every quest i can find no matter how low the level is.
---
What boss do you need NR totem on in AQ? That’s it, you don’t, because you cover soak groups with hunter.
---
When you had 400 ms of pong in average, 800x600 resolution and a max of 15 FPS during raid, you max your chance to have your tank survive :D
---
Hey neighbor.  The imbalance does fucking suck.  I played on Thunderlord for a while back in the day, which was *heavily* Alliance favored, and it fucking sucked.  It only snowballed over time and the realm completely died.  
---
On a side note, if you played TBC and later, we were in the same battlegroup (I moved to Feathermoon), so there's a small chance you may have brutally murdered me in a BG at some point.
---
But what is your point? You want me to be gender neutral?
---
I see plenty of alliance ganking horde on Kirtonos. I can barely even level in STV.
---
LK
---
Not in tbc
---
If you notice someone hasn’t roll you really should say something. Some people are focused on the fight and don’t realize there’s a roll/chest. That being said I never do rerolls in these scenarios.
---
Some people have lives 🤷‍♂️ not me, but I'm sure some people do.
---
someone give this man a gold
---
You realise rested xp caps at 1.5 levels and takes 10 days to earn. So those 8 levels would have taken you around 50 days to do if you were only using rested xp. Yeah... I call BS.
---
For whatever reason people just ignore the patrols and aggro them at inopportune times in Strath Live. It's nuts. Maybe I've just had bad luck with Strath Live but people keep bodypulling the damn patrols even though I call them.
---
Battle Shout isn't nerfed.
---
I HAVE to go to BRS to obtain late game pre raid BiS gear.
---
You can SKIP STV no problem. 
---
Also, what’s with the jesus names in this thread?
---
Pretty much why I stopped playing. I want to play, not killing 1 mob each minute. Transfer to lower pop? No as all of the 3 eng pve server are full.
---
night elf priests rise up
---
&gt; If the DPS gives you the time
---
Ah, there is the kicker. Yes, if the DPS gives you the time to build threat then of course you can AoE tank. Problem is, as been discussed here, that DPS don't do that. You will not be able to AoE tank if everyone goes ham immediately. You can tab target and use sunder/revenge or even go berserker stance with whirlwind (+sweeping strikes if you have) but since you're not in defensive stance it doesn't generate any extra threat, just from the damage and that will be lost soon, not to mention a 6 second CD on whirlwind before you can do it again. Also, don't use sweeping strikes and rend/thunderclap, much better to just use it with whirlwind. Thunderclap does NO extra threat, can't be used in defensive stance, and deals a measly 10-20 damage for 25(!) rage. The fact that you recommend Thunder Clap for AoE tanking makes me doubtful of your knowledge to be honest.
---
Maybe you are thinking of when tanks could spam Demo shout in the beginning of Classic and get amazing threat? That was a bug and has been changed.
---
Futhermore it's much different in 60's dungeons than leveling. You can tank just fine with arms and 2H when leveling, not as easy in end-game dungeons. Speccing into prot helps a little but if dps goes AoE ham immediately and it's a 3+ pack it's gonna still be a struggle and easiest is to just skull mark one and put Concussion Blow on it and ignore it while you build threat on the others and hope the skull marked one dies fast enough before it can do any real damage..
---
Have you thought about getting + speed to boots?
---
Mate iv master looted a piece of gear to myself and disenchanted it in front of the people who wanted it, not in classic but during wrath, I’m a changed man now I swear! 
---
What you described doesnt make you a ninja looter.
---
For honor! *hands over a sack of gold for win-trade*
---
And despite all the bitching we finish dungeons in a third of the time we did back then, threat issues or not.
---
Not much will change at all when P2 comes out, perhaps for a short while when it just hit
---
Ok.
---
So what if it is? Don’t like it? Reroll or transfer. 
---
Blizzard haven’t fucked up at all. Pvp servers are all like this.
---
From the guy that brought you the great comment 
---
"Holy labia!" in response to a woman
---
I don't really know what my question is here... but is anyone else kind of struggling on OCE servers? I hate horde, not for morality reasons, i just think they're all really ugly and I dont want to spend my play time looking at green people or farm animals. I really don't want to play on a PVP server because frankly i don't play wow to get camped, but i also want to play on a high population server. Every PVP server for OCE is so insanely horde dominated that you can't spend 2 minutes outside a town before you get chain-murdered. But remulos just doesn't feel as... big? I'm considering just rolling a US realm, because remulos feels like a party not enough people showed up to, and arugal/yojamba/felstriker all feel like a really crowded party full of people who want to kill you before you can even get a drink...
---
Engineering for the win!
---
What is the likelihood of implementing battlegrounds along with phase 2?
---
it's still easy to hit 60 if you can find a good group to dungeon with, but in terms of questing and getting rep then it's a lost cause.
---
ZF will be even hard to do, as people will be camping outside of ZF waiting for people to go out and reset to kill them constantly, ZF is very big for this due to it's dungeon entrance is outside and easy  to get to, if you can get over that and can get to brd it won't be too bad, at 57-58 you can get to strat and level up pretty safely
---
overall get your 60 fast, people going out and in of dungeon can be the best place to farm honor, so i don't think you can be safe anywhere
---
How is this a surprise to anyone? It's been 15 years since its release. Classic won't ever be Vanilla, but it's the next best thing.
---
Cap is 5% damage reduction from glancing blows at 308 weapon skill.
---
I'm in Null! New member but  so proud.
---
And he never drops an Eye of Shadow
---
Let me guess: Loot council? :)
---
Thanks man. Thats helpful. Guess ill farm the 400g for edgemasters now :D
---
We did MC one week with only one warlock. Tanked all the Garr adds. It’s a pain in the butt but possible.
---
    #showtooltip Heroic Strike
---
    /startattack
---
    /cast Heroic Strike
---
    /stopcasting
---
First press queues up Heroic Strike, second press stops it if it's queued. Press right after your main hand hit, press again right before it's about to hit.
---
Cleave works the same, so if you're high on threat, just copy the macro and replace Heroic Strike with Cleave and you've got a button to do the same trick, but without the increased threat of HS, when you're sitting high on the threat meter.
---
Every time they had news about reduced layers the queues went up. One time this happened on nerly every eu server at the same time. From no queue to 3k. Coincidence I guess...
---
You’re completely leaving out glancing, the massive reason why 9% hit 300 skill is way worse
---
Could layers be removed at the same time as phase 2 rolls out?
---
Yes. Don't give a fuck what blizzards official position is, it is cheating.
---
It really depends on the level. I’m feral tank and it’s a huge difference to be tanking around level 30-40 and level 60. Pretty much all rage talents are in other trees than the feral one. And mobs also hit harder at 60, giving you all the rage you want.
---
But then again it depends on the dungeon you do and where in the dungeon you are. The start of a dungeon with level 55 mobs gives barely any rage. The end of the dungeon with level 60 mobs gives a ton.
---
Yeah I got to agree with you here.
---
Social aspect has to be big in Classic. I couldn't do MC for 2-3 hours without getting a Thing if it wasn't for the great People I raid with.
---
Having a good time and enjoying ourselves. Get loot and it is a great evening. Don't get loot and it still is!
---
Get yourself a nice guild of People your Age and by P4 you will be best friends :D
---
Hey a friend to join a grp with you. Then log onto an alt and have them invite your alt to the grp. Log back onto your main and have your friend leave the grp. When you're ready to reset simply log out and onto the alt in your grp. Wait 2 mins for leader to switch to your alt and reset the instance. Pesto Pasta you're done.
---
Negative. Van down by the river.
---
Thank you for that, any word if it's actually a bug or not?
---
Oh dude that chest piece is amazing, I kept it into my 50s.
---
its probably like druid gear nobody else need at after few runs u get a full set.
---
People saying silly shit like *Your talents must be real shit if you need to go so far as to hide them...* obviously hasn't played druid in vanilla/classic. Some serious guilds really don't have enough experience with druids to know that HotW + NS is just as good as MG + NS as soon as you get like 3-5 raid pieces. Molten Core is an EASY raid where if you focus like 10% and don't put out overheals like a bafoon you should be able to put out efficient and good heals without falling under 50% mana at the most. All in all, you shouldn't have to play a booring spec that sucks for everything else but raids when you can play a spec that is fun/versatile and just as good. Hide that shit guys :D
---
Unless Blizzard has said otherwise, I'd think their original intention is pretty clear and they will remove layering on the remaining servers.
---
Anything beyond a statement from Blizzard is just pointless speculation.
---
What's your ping like on US servers? If it's not horrible and you're cool with raiding at US times then you can go for it.
---
El's Angling Reborn.
---
No, back in the days was this magical time when everyone waited for the tank to get some threat. Everyone had deep understanding of his class, other classes and the game in general. It is known.
---
Like Classic WoW takes skill LUL
---
The absolute majority couldnt care less. I'd be named Poopdicksandwich if thats what I had to do to play.
---
Its just that reddit has an obsurd obsession with their names.
---
Yet tanks are still as rare as the Andean Condor. Some things never change
---
&gt; but I went and deleted his character.
---
God damn bro...did he ever forgive you for that?
---
That's terrible...
---
https://www.method.gg/raid-history
---
According to this one, in Vanilla, not really.
---
Ok so we almost have the exact same layout on our spells and consumables and we have a guild called Omega on our server too. Was kinda strange.
---
I hate Garr, Baron and Golemagg. They've never dropped any shaman gear, even in our second raid
---
Kerroz is on the way!
---
Yeah the other guy just thinks his damage is because his dick is just so big, not because we are way past the patch for MC... Had they released classic with the same patches as the game progresses there would be no one  being able to one phase rag, the damage just isn’t there.
---
No we use DKP. I have been im every single raid and only spent my points on this set so I was the first to get it 😊
---
why not?
---
Having a look through his post history might give you a clue.
---
Yeah, was considering selling a few Strat Live runs for orbs before I got my epic mount. While I feel the "everyone is there so it's a bit unfair to "reserve" stuff when everyone contributes" I checked the drop list and I didn't need anything at all, only orbs. So taking ONE orb for the run doesn't feel that bad, after all if that's unacceptable I will just go somewhere else and the likelihood of getting another tank is pretty low since they also don't really need anything.
---
As a matter of fact I even saw a group looking for Strat Live run, only tank needed for A LONG time in LFG. Then they suddenly changed it to "tank gets first orb" and I only saw two of those messages and then they were gone.. :P
---
They're losers, don't run dungeons with them later on.
---
Bis is 6%. There are **no complete bis lists** for fury to my knowledge. The best one, fight clubs, is missing of the tiger boes and bds set which sim very well. 
---
People expect you to have a brain and figure out how you’re getting 305 skill and 6 hit by yourself. 
---
An example of why a “bis list” isn’t that useful: phase 1 fury bis technically includes accuria, which you should not have loot priority on because you’d replace quickly.
---
There is no kicker because me and my buddy have done it successfully. I'm not really sure why everyone is going in with the "AHA". As if you got me without me doing anything. Thunderclap is there to initial grab aggro, cause once you have aggro its hard to lose it, of course it's not going to hold against DPS by itself but if your healer needs to throw you a heal early on it will hold aggro against that, constant damage from rend, sweeping, tab, TC, and cleave. All dependent on how many mobs are on you is more than enough to hold aggro. Again DPS not waiting until you grab aggro is dependent on your group dynamics and how well you convey the message. 
---
As for level 60, thats great, I am not jumping into lvl 60 and raid with 2-hand or dual. However Ive ran with DPS who just tank "as-is" with DW, no spec change and maybe throw on a shield when its needed but otherwise tanked with their pure DPS build for late game dungeon like strath and scholo and we did great. My buddy and I aren't there yet since we are just slowly leveling our alts on off hours but I have no doubt it's not going to be much different considering we are mostly levelling through dungeons so we'll be hitting up our PRE-BiS gear as we level.
---
Again, proof of it working is out there and not really hidden. People have been AoE tanking all the way up.
---
Thats funny! What server are you on?
---
Princess huhuran
---
&gt;What
---
Yeah it happened, not to the degree it does now though.
---
Did he say he capped tho
---
The slower the better basically..
---
Don't sweat it for now, use your fun new bow.
---
underrated comment. Made a sitload of money from these. Brains sell really good
---
&gt;You'll still get to PvP, but with the people who actually want PvP.
---
But the best part about pvp server is killing people that dont want to pvp
---
If you level with skinning, and prioritize the levels you need to mob grind on skinnable mobs, then do dungeon runs from late 50's to 60 you can have enough gold for your epic mount by 60. I had over 100g at 40, and was only 100g shy from my epic mount at 60. Of course you can't spend any money at all while leveling but it's doable.
---
Warrior+Paladin as mentioned are good, though bear in mind you will be sharing a lot of the same loot/gear early on.  But you can swap out the paladin for a Priest or any healing class which will make warrior levelling infinitely easier plus you have the added benefit of having a tank/healer for any groups you want to make.
---
Mage+Mage or Mage+Warlock would be pretty good for immense damage and AoE.  Especially good now since spellcleave groups are so popular.
---
Double druid is a great combo but i'd say druid is probably one of the trickier classes to play initially, but great fun and very versatile once you have it down.
---
That's my thinking anyway but there will be lots of good combos
---
Ya they give buffs, people will always want items for these quests.
---
So, what? Once you have Naxx gear you clear the new raids once and stop? Why bother running the new raids with no progression? Certainly wouldn't keep me playing
---
I have a tank, healer and DPS. To be a healer and tank is more of a stress since if you screw up, that might be it, which is rarely the case as DPS. Also, as DPS I can sit and sip a beer and doing a semi poor job, and none will notice, as a tank (at least that's my feeling) I cannot slack.
---
if layers are active when worldbosses arrive it's gonna be a shitshow
---
but our server is far from getting to one layer so I really don't know how they want to release p2 on the 12th
---
A lvl 48 gives exactly the same amount of honour as a lvl 60
---
Talking shit online, you just described youself perfectly. And "running from a fight"... you do realise it's an internet game right? Oh right, you probably think ganking lowbies is very brave. No wonder you have to call yourself smart, it must be a compliment you don't receive.
---
Username checks out.
---
He never said he was 60.
---
No he’s not; shit will go down like that uncle who went over and beat up his nephew for killing him in Wow on their server .
---
Blood will rain-people will take sabbatical.
---
Your family will perish -  fuck it they were just slowing you down you fucking beast
---
I am only 45 myself...I guess I will use the night elf racial even more lol. I don't have much time to play but I think I can get in 2-3 more levels before it hits at least.
---
Happy cakeday! Perhaps pleb wasn't the best word to use but oh well... and not everyone has the time/dedication to play on pvp realms. So, what's your opinion/knowledge on the question at hand?
---
"If you need a trinket like that to help you farm and duel, go home" - An officer about the Barov Peasent Caller.
---
Well you are absolutely right that is the mindset of most poeple, what you do in the game is your decision.
---
Since the dungeons and raids are relatively easy no one needs bis gear to kill the bosses, so do what you enjoy and play to have fun thats ehat its all about
---
Eh I guess it’s just how I play the game then... I straight up will not let it stress me out, and if a group is forcing that on me when I’m tanking I tell them to adjust or I’ll leave. Then I leave if they won’t.
---
I play game specifically to unwind and relax, if I’m stressed out I’m not doing it right.
---
I didn’t read a word you wrote and with that I can still say with 100% conviction that you made a mistake rolling on a PvP server. This is the worst fucking experience of my life god I wish my friends weren’t so gung ho on being some mlg god gamers thinking it’s cool to be on a pvp server. I just wanna hit 60 and jerk my gerk in raids with the boys.
---
No, that was just because he's an asshole.
---
I'd do some dungeons to get some new gear which helps you level + get better gear. This means that going back to quest where you left off you will feel more powerfull towards the mobs and go faster.
---
I personally always try to be 1 level higher than the mobs where I am questing, this does help in kill time and makes it more fun if you don't die because you missed 3 hits in a row for example.
---
Warcraft was literally orcs vs humans. The entire series development is pvp.
---
Are you in my guild? We can kill everything first try but can not kill ragnaros and often wipe at the trash, so a random yesterday told us we were the worst raid group he had in 15 years.
---
You know that spell power didn’t exist during MC? Just a quick example of how much more damage we are doing these days
---
Not a bug, it's a feature
---
Why?
---
How on earth are gear tokens bad?
---
A deterministic way to work towards a specific piece of gear is literally not a bad thing.
---
dwarf is just boneless human
---
horde racials superior for pvp is most of it
---
All those rp names and then theres "Mohawkman"
---
All i can say is get HealComm
---
at this point I honestly doubt he's in the game, haven't seen him once and never saw someone with the +shadow dmg wand
---
Yea sometimes I droppt to 30 fps in og (I have 200 fps Capes most of the time) because of the anmout of players. But I’m also bad with PCs maybe that’s normal
---
So in Vanilla horde has world first for clearing Onyxia, MC, AQ and Naxx, versus Alliance only having world first for BWL. But somehow this doesn't count as Horde having a lot of world firsts?
---
what are the slash commands, google is only turning up the regular group commands
---
You and your friends missed out.
---
People on RP servers have the most ultimate reactions when you gank, kill, or disagree with them.
---
For this reason I have always played on RP servers (Goon Squad) even though I don’t RP myself.
---
I know I’m a cancer, but god it’s so awesome
---
Also the events such as building a raid to kill another city, people putting out real bounties on the forums with gold attached, etc are great
---
That’s her “you must be this big to enter” baguette.
---
If a healer who can't keep up a 2h tank in BRD on big trash packs, triple fire elemental packs or Emperor is bad, I'd like to see your definition of a normal or good healer. Most likely a priest who outgears and/or outlevels the dungeon.
---
I'm fairly convinced the mount doesn't exist at this point anyway.
---
I think it's a blizzard conspiracy.
---
It’s really just revenge for the darn priests taking our shadow dmg gear
---
&gt;  TOEPs 
---
That the Epic Trinket?
---
Love your token shadow priest!
---
I love you both
---
In my opinion, the real end game here is faction PVP. The war between The Alliance and The Horde.
---
I guess you have a valid point when it comes to the PVE content, but for many, PVE is just a means to get gear so they can PVP better. The PVP content will always be challenging, chaotic and unpredictable. That's why it still captivates me at least.
---
Hope you find he joy you're looking for in the game.
---
If they bring back old talent system and remove item equalization on pvp i can go back to retail but i don't see it's happening. Every class feels same at retail and i hate it.
---
Look man, you're the one who's light on gear and experience and insists on solo tanking ubrs. I'd rather two fury prot tanks in an ubrs run than one deep prot warrior with leveling gear. If everyone was going to be undergeared, I'd probably rather two deep prot tanks. Stop acting like one shitty tank is better than two shitty tanks. The reason you can't finish ubrs is bc one undergeared tank shouldn't try to tank a full ubrs run by himself. Get two tanks of whatever variety and two healers and 6 dps. Stop trying to solo tank it if you still are working on getting bis gear. 
---
That's all I said. "I'd rather two fury prot tanks than one undergeared deep prot tank".
---
Finally, the right answer. Been in here for almost 2 weeks now, how are you?
---
I’m not sure give it a try I am curious
---
Some of them are so weird. /Bleed lol
---
I dont see the problem? Dont play the game then?
---
The same can be said for most MOBA games, Counter-strike etc etc etc. Everything gets theorycrafted these days.
---
You don't give men a blue sack of gems. That's unhealthy.
---
Don't get me wrong, they're very useful.  But if I had to go without two classes in MC it would probably Druids and Hunters, with Warlocks a close third.  Trolls are definitely the best race in classic to go with that.
---
On the other hand, I can't wait to see the first crazy fucking guild to clear a 40-Druid or 40-Paladin MC. :)
---
Yeah I did emperor as a 53 paladin.
---
Ever heard of group compilation? Put all your tanks in one group and give them 1 shaman, put a healer in there if group is not full, put all meles in another groups and give them another shamans, and then shamans can buff whoever then want whenever they want. Bloodlust for tank group on pull for good threat +wf. Then wf for melees.
---
Sounds to me like you're shitting on how he plays the game.
---
To be honest i didn’t know “spell crit” was a thing, initially thought it was crit (seeing as, you know, it’s a high dps sword).
---
Even still, my noob brain would have reasoned that a 26 to 35 dps increase for a melee dps class was far more valuable than a 1% spell crit chance for a ranged dps class 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I guess you could say he has a blue sack...
---
Maybe people just dont care enough?I'm playing warrior. I get myself a priest and shaman and just hulksmash stuff. Therefore I simply dont c-a-r-e.
---
If you want to play competitive PvP, you shouldn't play WoW. You seem to be in the wrong genre for that - especially seeing how broken arenas have been since the dawn of TBC.
---
Next you will complain how engineering is pretty much mandatory for PvP.
---
Ok
---
&gt; Phase 2 on pvp servers is going to be a complete shit show and i wouldnt be suprised if half the flight paths are also camped to shit, so you can barely travel anywhere either .
---
This is an exaggeration to say the least...It will be easily avoidable for the most part.
---
Sick Runs !!!
---
I am 60 since a few days, hoped to make lots of gold in DM. I had to learn the run, and my gear is still shit aswell, so ended up dying like 30-40 times, costing me like 100 Gold.
---
I can reliably get up to the Boss now but, for me at least, the run looks way easier then it is. Its quite difficult.
---
The Wolf looks amazing, definitely trying it!!
---
This is just beautiful, both the story and the writing. I feel like, maybe, I finally understand how people feel reading sports columns.
---
If 4-6 hours a day is casual, then I’d hate to see what hardcore is. 
---
6 hours a day would be 42 hours a week. If you’re spending more time playing wow than you would at a full-time job, then you’re not a casual.
---
They were also doing inktober which would have slowed them down
---
the Meta has become more available to the broader audiance of casual plebs though, is what OP is pointing out.
---
You really can't...I mean, being flagged while your enemy isn't is just stupid.
---
&gt; Of course, whether or not one wants that challenge also depends on how much time they have; it's understandable if someone has an hour to play and they don't want to spend a quarter of it corpse running.
---
It's not a challenge. People with more time have better gear. Better gear &gt; skill.
---
^ 100% correct answer.
---
People only get butt hurt with chests when something other than shit is in them and they were too arrogant to roll.
---
Fuck them you are not a ninja.
---
As a hunter at lvl 51, should I stop leveling in the world and start dungeoning for pre-BiS?
---
YOU THOUGHT I WAS JUST A WOLF, BUT IT WAS ME, DIO!!!
---
It tried to ger the horde countdown to classic guild today roll there, they chose firemaw. The 10k+ queues killed the guild and spread the core over three different servers.
---
While at Zandalar was playable and not queued until peak times. Firemaw started getting queues around 12.00.
---
Good warriors will carry **atleast** 3 sets. 
---
- PvE DPS set
---
- Plate/stam heavy World PvP set
---
- Tanking set.

But when my frostbolt crits for 1600 on a random mob you just pulled it's gonna go from me. If my warlock buddy does the same thing you wont be able to taunt them back without a cooldown. Once multiple mobs are out of melee range you wont be able to generate threat on them but if I'm a bad player I'm not stopping. Presence of Mind -&gt; frostbolt is another 800 threat plus 500 from CoC, then blink and another 800 from a third frostbolt and we're only about 8 seconds into the fight. Think you can generate 3.5k+ threat on a target who leaves melee range with the rest of the mobs immediately after the pull in under 8 seconds? And if I'm not the only one doing this can you do it to two people?
---
You can definitely generate AoE threat but if I'm going ham right away with no regard for threat you're probably not going to hold agro against me without focusing my target.
---
Oh wow. Sorry, my bad. Started to play horde only since tbc when belfs were introduced, always just assumed that shamans had it from the begining. Feeling pretty stupid right now indeed.
---
Forget the grind, how would pvp even be fun without a key item, like a good weapon?
---
Swamp of sorrows
---
When you tame a low level pet and has Claw (rank 1)
---
So you need an additional shaman and lose out on a real dps.
---
And I've just hit 52 and was hoping to tank brd till 60 lol
---
What makes me laugh is seeing literally every Warrior/Rogue/Pala/etc wearing Truestrike Shoulders
---
Which region is this?
---
Keep hitting it. Once you get it right, you can make that money back easily. I think I spent about 40g in respec cash + 25g repairs on getting it right. Since then I've made about 250g on it in a couple of hours of casual running.
---
I love being on a PvE server. You still have Battlegrounds and you still have world PvP raids. You just remove the part where someone 5 levels above you keeps ganking you when you're trying to quest
---
Basically anything works so main thing is to play something you both like. Maybe don’t both go healers since it would be painful in endgame as most groups only have 1 healer.
---
There's 1 thing I can promise you, that's is Blizzard Activision is going to do what they can to keep the millions of people playing wow to keep subscribing.
---
Maybe it means TBC or a newer wow classic expansion down a different timeline, who knows but it is in their best interest Nd the best interest of shareholders to keep us playing
---
Lets hope so atleast.
---
Well then there's no way for a tank to die.
---
&gt; If your goal is to get geared, which is essentially the entire point of the game,
---
I don't know about you nor anyone else, but I play the game to have **fun**. Here's the kicker: Fun is subjective and therefore can differ between people. I've already done the whole "rush to raid, clear the content and get geared ASAP" during Vanilla, TBC, Wotlk, and I've also PvP'ed through those periods. Therefore, playing solely to obtain those two things haven't really been what made the game interesting for me this time around. 
---
&gt; you follow gear progression unless you have some fully geared guild carrying you.
---
Fully geared guild? You realize MC can be cleared by non-60's in leveling gear, right? There is absolutely *nothing* in the current content that even remotely requires any significant form of gear. If you were talking about later once BWL (to and extent) and AQ get released you might have a point.
---
I found that the economy varies from server to server, by a lot.
---
I got a Warden staff, asked reddit how much I should sell it for. People said 600g, the staff goes for 300g on my server, maybe 400g.
---
It's not based on population either it seems, our realm is still layered.
---
Make Amani Great Again!
---
Hahaha fuck, i missed that
---
I'd say most semi-casual guilds will clear the majority of AQ40 (except  C'thun). Twin emps and Ouro (might) be trouble aswell.
---
A true classic server had about 2,5k players, so your classic experience on Blackrock is as far from the true classic experience as possible. The WoW is not designed for 70k players...
---
Perfecto, thanks.
---
*tap forehead*
---
Haha, sadly the slowing is due to not enough time to dedicate to the series. Used to manage to sneak in some drawing while at work but lately workload is over the top and I can't anymore.
---
5 weeks dry now, least I got the shoulders...
---
Go DS/Ruin, with something like this: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/25002-2350000142301-52500051020001
---
The "default" guide suggests Improved Voidwalker, but I think it's not needed at all for endgame. When solo farming, stack stamina and sacrifice your VW for the regen buff, you will have very few downtimes. When doing 5-mans, you can still sacrifice Succubus.
---
Damn... people are so defensive about economy, this is useful information but people are busy telling you "achually it's a fair price". 
---
It might be worth it but let's be real, if i can save 4g+ by flying for like 5 mins that's especially good while living.
---
I wish more people posted tips about worthwhile recepies buy with this feedback I'm sure it won't happen.
---
&gt;You'll wipe in BWL don't worry If your guild is packed with people that played 14 years ago
---
This so much, the first 2 bwl bosses are known as the "guildbreakers" and atleast 90% of the guilds now which are currently clearing mc with ease are definitely not ready for it, and the whole wtfzomg nuke top dps meta is not going to make them any easier (actually that would make razorgore easier, but not vael), more than half of the current top dps players that are just unable and unwilling to install and watch a threath meter and which forced the tank meta into less optimal fury specs just to keep up with aggro will have to be filtered out and benched or even kicked for bwl progression, especially vael where you need to have 3-4 tanks always at the top of the threathmeters.
---
The game is known which does produce this but this is always going to happen. The problem is information when vanilla came out moved slowly. It took me months until I heard of thottbot back then and doing certain quests I had to consult guildies and friends who had done it. There was not a mass of info yet and comments to tell you where to go. Now every new game has a wowhead dor the game that has comments within the first week on what to do and where to go. We have people datamining items and people figuring out builds before the content is released. People have a better understanding of how mmos work so that makes it easier to bee line straight to the most efficient gear and builds. Sadly even if classic was released today as a new game all these things would be found out quickly and we woulsnt be too far off from what we are at now. People know too much and information travels too fast to get that 2004 experience.
---
Im glad you are going to enjoy it, but there is nothing wrong with people leveling actually wanting to level. It’s enough of a grind without wasting hours upon hours of getting killed or camped. The amount of bullshit you have to do to skip STV is enough to make anyone want to roll on a PVE server.
---
If these fuckers have played for 15 years you'd assume their social circle is aware. Gaming doesn't make you an outcast.
---
The thing is the horrible people are the only ones who fall for this anyway so you can never lose :D
---
This is actually a good suggestion. The game is what you make of it. 30man MC - Higher challange - Higher reward.
---
Whenever i found myself slightly stuck, i would just start grinding mobs till i found my solution, was easier than to go around looking for the next hub anyway.
---
yes, you don't stop getting hit % just because you are yellow capped
---
the classic rogue discord has a spreadsheet you can use:
---
https://discord.gg/Pkkntws
---
Exactly, it’s my raid chat + guild dps + guildclass channels all bundled together
---
yO tAUnT!
---
It's the name of the quest (in the badlands) iirc
---
That's exactly what I'm talking about. If even the best part looks like a stupid waste of time, it's better to avoid pvp servers altogether :)
---
It was a pain in the ass and NR totem was a big advantage.
---
For your actions, you shall be reborn as a Loa in the afterlife. Gnome and Dwarf blood alike shall be spilled in your name as you grant your followers your blessing. Can you hear the tribe drums yell for the name of Cold'jin of the Frostmane?
---
Casual players hit 60 a couple weeks ago? What?
---
How many hours playing per week would you define as casual?
---
My crew’s probably been averaging like 15/week and we’re all in the 50-53 range.
---
60 a couple weeks ago would be like 3hrs/day every day and would def be more than casual to me.
---
The regular raid frames or other raid frames? I use Luna raid frames and I can customize which buffs I want displayed on each member and where I want em. I use it mostly to see track other peoples HOTS and such to see if people need healing, but I guess it should work for what you want too.
---
My mouse hand is actually worse from playing guitar :p
---
You can do 1-200 for less than 10g
---
I kept reading to see the 13$ joker to be used. You dont disappoint!
---
So anyway, I started blastin'.
---
Why is this the EXACT thing that went through my head? And why is it the first thing I see after looking in the comments?????
---
i told a hunter the day before DM dropped that his BiS trinket drops tomorrow and he still said he would roll on HoJ if it dropped cause it’s better than what he has. 
---
It didn’t drop
---
Yea.
---
No, we aren't. You said 1/3rd. :P
---
Shaman is great for that level, by level 6 you get Earthbind Totem for slowing gnomes and Earth Shock for interrupts, as well as a heal!
---
I have no idea but kind of doubt it, easiest would be to bring a priest to just mind vision over there I guess (or maybe you can't due to gates?).
---
Fucking gankers
---
Maybe you arent as good in PvP as you think, if you complain that much.
---
Try to befriend a tank or find a guild with some. Forming groups as a non tank can take quite some time.
---
Finding a pug tank willing to do a likely 3 hour brd full clear is a rare.
---
Oh, trust me, we are. Try doing a dungeon in only T0 gear and no items with +spell/+heal. That's how we did 5 mans in vanilla.
---
It will sound very smug, but it's basically the same thing as finding something fun to do vs being dependant on someone or something to entertain you. Like seeing a kid sitting in the middle of a toy store saying that he's bored because there's no clown jumping around him putting toys in his hands. Classic has a lot to offer, it just doesn't spoonfeed it to you and if you done only the most basic progression - lvl60, without professions and you done some dungeons and that's it and you're not willing to do more quests, farm stuff, grind skills, do world events and whatnot then sure, you'll be bored, but not because there isn't stuff to do.
---
It’s always sunny in Azeroth.
---
A mount doesn't make your character stronger, it makes him faster out of combat - which has its upsides, but overall it's just a convenience thing.
---
If you want a leg up to get in with a decent guild, then having the helmet is a much better investment than an epic mount.
---
Ultimately, what you want more is what you should pick, power or convenience.
---
Nice but why are you not picking up all the loot from the bugs? The vendor loot stacks up fast while farming these
---
This time pick a dwarf.
---
Hey guys,
---
I decided to roll a hunter, which I never played before. I read some guides about skills and of course taming. I think I need a few levels in game to get used to. My big question is, which pet I should use. My first choice would be something tanky and many mentioned the boar to be OP. Aestheticwise, I would rather have a bear. Is the difference big? (Heard the boar has this Warrior dash, cant remember the Name) So yeah, thats it basically, I wanna know if I can go with a bear instead of a boar. I thought about cats too, but I think for leveling I would rather have tankiness instead of dmg. Also read about the Rike. Some say it's very nice others say it's a noobtrap?
---
Thank you guys for taking the time to read this
---
I would save both, for Mooncloth cd is ok gold, and Herbalism for when you wanna farm some DM
---
Uh. I think you either accidentally a word, or got words order a few out of.
---
Crazy. I havnt ever seen a lot of those
---
&gt; I understand that you don't have very much time to play at all, I imagine your /played is a couple days? Thing is, most people are able to fit in more than 2-3 hours a week
---
Either you are deliberately being misleading, or you are using numbers where you haven't even considered the math. A decent timing to reach 60 is 8 days /played, which results in 192 hours. Now, Classic has been out for ~65 days. Dividing 192 hours by 65 days leaves us with a requirement to play 3 hours **per day** to have reached level 60. And 8 days /played is honestly pretty fast, you aren't going to see any newcomers to the game being able to do anything even remotely close to that without serious help. 
---
That's also assuming something like 0 time spent on alts, not spending too much time on professions, not going out of your way to help others etc. 
---
&gt;  Normally, people who play this sort of game will play a lot more than you. You are not the norm. You're an exception.
---
They will? Do you have anything to support your claim regarding the average playtime of players in Classic WoW?
---
Maybe that's because back then we would not have this amount of DPS going on. I mean, plenty of autoattack hunt, afk mage, dead warrior swimming in lava... etc
---
When Phase 2 hits, they will have to introduce queues if more players try to log in compared to what usually fits in one layer.
---
Cant reset when u are inside the instance tho.. that is why u log out and ask some1/log in to alt and reset. Else u have to run out wich takes longer than the run itself.
---
If you don't want them to tank for you anymore then sure.
---
It's for the five second rule. Very helpful.
---
Okay yes you‘re right. That wasn‘t clear from the question.
---
Good job you be doin mon
---
The method is valid, but it requires quite a presence of mind and takes your focus off of other more important things: Such as your rotation, consumable usage, positioning and not standing in fire. Add to that, most boss fights in MC is currently 30-60 seconds long (Rag being 1min30sec). With the shortness of the fights currently, and the other mentioned reasons, I dont see any point in allocating mental resources to keeping track of your yellow OH swings.
---
It's going to be all out war, carnage of the highest level, cannot wait 😂
---
With Troll hunters?
---
400g... \*cries in Gehennas\*
---
Nothing funny really
---
I hate to say it, it is just history repeating itself.
---
Do you really think that people would not re-roll? It would not have made much difference IMO, because people did very much re-rolled to alliance heavy or horde heavy servers to be part of the advantage side.
---
The transfers didn't help, but if they were going to open it up to paid transfers, it would have happened all the same.
---
I was there earlier this year too, and yes was brutal so much fun tho 😉
---
Are people actually buying flasks? they seem way too expensive, 70 gold for a 2h buff on my server, and there are no hard raids out yet
---
I am a troll and I live in a hole, trolly trolly hole.
---
From a technical standpoint it **is** a bug and it has been confirmed by blizzard. They have also confirmed that they wont be doing anything about it.
---
Uhhh.. yeah, gimme a sec… I’m coming up with thirty-two point three three uh, repeating of course, percentage, of survival.
---
Why don’t you do pugs urself?
---
Shadowlands is no flying?
---
Please don't post crap.
---
Combination of better gear and the average player just knowing much more than they did back then.
---
&gt; So rogue tanking only works on alliance if you have Paladins to BoP the other tank that needs to leave?
---
"Only works" is an exaggeration, i'd say makes it easier. Idk on Horde, I never go to Naxx on horde only Alliance.
---
Jesus, I can see myself doing this if I was playing a rogue wiping an entire raid running together with full world buffs and making them rage.
---
Maybe in phase 5
---
You won't see any measurable net gains to DPS with this method though considering how short fights are currently. Maybe in longer fights in later content.
---
You can look up the population on the servers [here](http://classicrealminfo.com). 
---
I think you can‘t really much do anything about it, because horde players are the majority on most servers, since most people do play horde.
---
The promise was no layering during phase 2.
---
You do earn a decent amount of gold just by running dungeons. Also I dont know exactly how it is with Ele Shamy, but for most classes the best pvp gear comes from raiding early on. Also you will at least need decent stamina blues from all the dungeons for pvp. In the end, I would spend my time in wow in a way that brings me joy. So do you what you like doing.
---
&gt; you haven’t had to worry about threat since ICC 
---
Try "since BC".
---
As a long time rogue, threat became laughable in Wrath. Put tricks of the trade on the tank and then go fucking nuts on the boss, done. Or for AoE do the same and fan of knives. That combined with the tank using their own threat generation abilities and caring about aggro in any serious manner just wasn't a thing.
---
We have queues AND layers right now
---
I‘d love to see Classic+. New raids could have an Progression to not disturb the gear gap further (naxx gear vs fresh lvl 60 is already brutal). Some kind of paragon-level that only works for the new raid or all raids but has no effect on pvp or something like this. 
---
Also I wouldn’t mind if they introduce lvl 60 variants of all the low level dungeons. Scale the items inside to match scholo/strat/ubrs and let have people fun finding the new BiS that isn’t really that much better. But people could have more diversity on 5 man content.
---
Probably extremly insecure. Making a 300 word essay about this makes it even worse.
---
Carrions Birds/Owls are supposed to be the most useful pets for leveling/low level instances because of their "screech" ability which acts like a demoralizing shout (lowers attack power of all nearby enemies) so it will pull aggro from loose mobs. Keep in mind that optimizing your pet is not that big of a deal if you are just taking your time leveling and just having a blast leveling a hunter. All pets are fine, bears are too if you want one!
---
Crit cap in classic wont be as much of a problem as it was on private servers because classic got 3% (or was it 4%?) crit supression on boss targets.
---
Fear ward isn’t necessary for any fight since tanks can stance dance fears. It’s a useful crutch.
---
Did you not understand the point of the comment you were replying to? He/she was worried about the release of the honor grind since, due to him/her likely not being 60 by then, will be a prime target for all the 60's roaming around for honor. Thereby potentially making it rather annoying to obtain the last couple of levels.
---
I don’t know every quest
---
Warlock and druid is also a classic combo: Hots give endless mana for the WL, mass pull with dots, fear and druid can tank the rest.
---
You definitely shouldn't be ashamed of your /played.  10 days played at 53 is considered slow.
---
Kinda racist but ok.
---
Yea because 3 sub level 55's are going to fare better against a group of 60's with raid gear.
---
By themselves +hit pieces make up pre-raid bis in most gear slots. Combined though you do indeed get past cap and you are expected to "figure this out" by yourself and gear for str/crit instead in certain slots if you are past the hitcap.
---
Basically, the bis-lists are for the most part correct, but all items being combined doesnt nessecarily make it a bis-set.
---
Have you looked at isboxer? They have a 7 day free trial.
---
Yeah, rules change in groups.
---
Once I had a mage whine because he was too lazy to give me water and gave it only to the healer. I'm a warlock and I invoked the bloody mage to the entrance... I'll never get how selfish some are.
---
Will you be tanking at all on the rogue?
---
Already suggested below but I'd like to  give another comment on it as it's a really good location.   
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=8602/monstrous-plaguebat](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=8602/monstrous-plaguebat)   Monstrous Plaguebats. Their grey items loot table is very profitable and combined with skinning you get a lot of gold potential depending on your servers leather costs.
---
Seems to be an awful lot of this behavior going about. 
---
I don't approve of loot council as a general practice since it really can go terribly wrong if "by coincidence" all gear is funneled onto people who "happen" to be among the officers and in the loot council - but any decent guild that cares about progress should prioritize their two main (main+off) tanks to increase their survivability and threat generation.
---
&gt; you can take your time leveling to 60, run some fun dungeons and engage in some world pvp and all of that is loads of fun, but you shouldn't be able to clear raids if you do that imo.
---
They shouldn't be able to clear raids? Like at all? Why not? What's stopping anyone from simply doing the raid later on? I don't understand your argument.
---
Longer queues then. 
---
This is what we asked them to do. We wanted Layering to be temporary. 
---
They can't introduce Phase 2 without removing Layering. 
---
If there are more characters on the realm than can fit in one layer, they will need queues.
---
I'm assuming Realm transfers are available from the realm.
---
It’s a DPS check fight right? High enough DPS and you don’t have to worry as much about NR resist, of course. But the totems would help if your DPS is on the edge of viable for the encounter.
---
I would personally ditch rogues before warlocks as Fury warriors basically fill the same niche. Can't think of anything rogues add that warriors do not. They practically use the same gear too.
---
bug-turned-feature then. Sort of the same thing that ended up creating the Tribes series (until Hi-Rez killed the series during Tribes: Ascend)
---
Thrash blade and mirahs song, both come from quests. 5 hit is not bad, if youre a human or orc (which you should be!)
---
To shoot the five year old?
---
Stealth mind-control into lave in black rock mountain is more roguelike than the entire rogue class though.
---
&gt; The average for hitting 60 is probably about 8.5 days.
---
What makes you believe that? The average on private servers was something around 8-9 days. Is that the number you are assuming is directly applicable to Classic as well or are you pulling it out your arse? Because I certainly hope you aren't expecting the average Classic-player to be as fast as the average private-server player, as that would be flat out silly. 
---
&gt; I did it in 7 days on both my 60s. The fact that I almost have a 3rd 60 and I have taken just entire weeks off because of work tells me you guys are slow.
---
Many people haven't taken any time off. Nor do they have more than 21 days /played at this point in time (which you seem to have). Assuming they need 10 days /played (which is more realistic in my opinion), with ~65 days since release, that requires more than 3½ hours of leveling *each* day. That's not necessarily being slow, that's just having other priorities in life.
---
Mp5 always works. Spirit Regen is limited by the 5 second rule (except if you have talents that grant you X% of you spirit regen to continue while casting)
---
They are around 100g on my server and I usually buy them, little else to spend gold on and its fun being much stronger than everyone else who didn't use one.
---
Better help those turtles make it to the ocean.
---
Taz'dingo!
---
That’s not how it use to be, why did they change it?
---
Dammit man!
---
This is amazing.
---
Great crew.
---
You can feel the love.
---
I don’t think black amnesty is in the game yet.
---
I already consider TBC (flying, ugly zones) and Wrath (flying, dungeon finder, annoying dailies) to be moving on the wrong path...  
---
They were still great, but I'm not gonna pretend flying was ever a good idea, nor was dungeon finder.
---
&gt; In classic its just a bunch of people with a bunch of BiS gear slaughtering the content with ease. 
---
That's kinda the charm. Character progress is about a powertrip. Raids start demanding and get easier and easier when people get geared. The enjoyment comes from this "oh look how easy it is for us now, we've mastered this" instead of doing something hard. It's for different tastest. Conversely, I get no enjoyment from clearing a hard boss. Instead it feel frustrating with no pay-off. Different tastes.
---
&gt; Hell, at least retail has mythic content. 
---
And that mythic content is data-mined, dps is simmed and comps are formulaic. It's not really different in that regard just more demanding skillwise.
---
Don't sweat it, the people talking about 8 days /played to 60 are talking about people that have significant experience in the game and/or are using tools to help them (like addons/guides). Well, they might not realize that's the crowd they are talking about, but it is.
---
The level 50 right now is fucking with me. I want to go back to prot Paladin but other than Maraudon, Sunken temple or ZF (all make me puke already) there is nothing I can farm.
---
I love healing but get denied for any BRD run instantly so I need to get to at least 52 before I can start thinking about BRD.
---
Fellow tanks- at what level did you get to tank BRD and how did it go leveling wise?
---
good old' goldshire
---
No, layers phase people into different layers so for example 10k people wont chill in org
---
Even if let's say 100k people log into a sever with layering then 100k ppl are logging in 
---
If they remove layering there will still be 100k people logging in. Removing that wont change anything with queues
---
I’m an orc with deathbringer, I’ve read every guide and what not. I stack 11% hit and can see a drastic change when I dip below 8 with my gear, top dps also.
---
So, being a dps and having that info, what should you do? 
---
Exactly, blink pull and aoe.
---
You are not a ninja looter. They are shitheads.
---
This is probably exactly what will happen.
---
When the realms restart after the Phase 2 upgrade, they will no longer have layers enabled.
---
and all 40 of them have to not be sitting on their thumbs and actually be dpsing, at the same time, for rag to be down in those first 3 minutes as many guilds claim to do
---
This video was just to show how I did it. I did indeed loot those when farming
---
The DPS is higher in some guilds. Right now some people are putting out 500 sustained dps single target while the vast majority are hardly pulling 150. Idk if you're just jaded because of the group you're with, but I think you're vastly overestimating the experience most people are having.
---
You can't reduce the amount of glancing blows.
---
I'm always curious as to how much aggro healing actually generates. Battle shout itself is like 300 aoe threat. Of all the party members I struggle to keep threat from I basically never have issues with the healer - ignoring all the shadow priests who heal while levelling + throw in random mind blasts :P
---
Layers will be gone in a few days and long queues will be back plus free server transfers.
---
sure as a healer or tank it is a viable option, for dps it might be only mages qualifying
---
Rend ay
---
I am just now getting to play WoW for the first time as I just got my first PC this year! All my friends played without me in high school, but now I get to join them (it’s just my bf who I’ve known since hs)! I am not good at typing, and I’ve been struggling to communicate in chat this whole time.. this list is incredibly helpful to a noob like me! Having any kind of short, easy way to communicate is a lifesaver! Thank you for posting this 🙏🏼🤩
---
No it’s Landon. Trust me on this one.
---
&gt; Lets just ignore the fact that 90% of all the bosses were killed first by alliance 
---
Let's be honest here, no one gives a crap who was first to clear some random boss, if it wasn't the end boss. The only arguable exception here is C'thun, given how easy he was after the nerf.
---
&gt; as well as \~70-80% of the top 10 guilds being alliance as well 
---
Ok. But I'm not sure what relevance this strawman has to the discussion. We're not talking about the guilds who came in second or worse (i.e. top 2-10), where talking about the guilds who came in first, i.e. World Firsts.
---
No one ever said that the majority of top guilds weren't alliance. The claim was simply that horde guilds got a lot of world firsts. Those two claims are not mutually exclusive.
---
&gt;because 1 single horde guild managed to pull through by recruiting \~200 people just to farm gold and consumables for their raid 24/7 to get the world first on the 2 final bosses. 
---
If you honestly believe guilds like Retribution or Death &amp; Taxes didn't also farm their asses off, then you are fooling yourself.
---
And as mentioned, Nihilum getting world first on C'thun didn't really have anything to do with farming or anything like that, given how easy he was after the nerf (the only reason Nihilum got WF there was due to the EU getting the patch first).
---
Depends on what else said person has been doing. For example I know a Tailor that grinded the blue dragonkin in Winterspring for the Robes of Winter Night pattern (and Sinew) instead of questing or cleaving instances. Wasn't the most effective xp/hour, but it did pay out pretty handsomely in regards to gold. Others have grinded out 2 non-gathering professions by the time they are 60, or have grinded out several different item-sets (Druids I'm looking at you).
---
Different people, different priorities. Just calling people slow acknowledges nothing of that and implies you hadn't even considered such aspects of the game for such people. Says more about you than the people you were trying to put down.
---
Man, I remember the music that's playing on last boss from the movie The Rock, good times.
---
Haha no it's a kind of odd weapon but it's great for druids, I believe GrinAndBareItAll is saying it kind of like "Finkle's lava dredger... It definitely is a druid!" since that's what lots of druids used for quite a while.
---
They released Dire Maul early for some incomprehensible reason.
---
I think there's a not-unreasonable chance that after a few weeks of P2 they'll rush out WSG and AV as well.
---
To use your example. (The actual numbers are different)
---
When Phase 2 drops, they won't let 100k people log on to the server at once anymore, 50k will log in, and 50k (Who used to go in Layer 2) will be in a queue.
---
The servers can't handle 100k in one Layer
---
Those are all hot garbage. Get a Thrash Blade at 45. Pay 20g for a Mara boost and get the ring as well.
---
Not true, i played private servers, nobody goes out of their way to kill players lower than what you gain honor from. Besided its a PVP game on a PVP server, god forbid if PVP happens.
---
you are doing something wrong
---
Im level 48 on pvp server, Alliance. I don't have time to get to 60 before the release so I'm prime fodder for pvp. If, and its not certain, it becomes unplayable I have other options to go down. Create an alt on RP server, pve on Horde side, gold farm for twinking. I personally don't think it will be that bad apart from BRD and if I have to grind quiet places so be it. I wouldn't stress, we won't know until it happens.
---
&gt;personally do DMT runs
---
is that you joe?
---
5 death is camping? Hahaha people nowdays, maybe should had rolled on a PVE server huh?
---
"Easier for Alliance"
---
"I won't trade WF totem"
---
Sounds like it actually isn't easier for Alliance then.
---
Novice AH question here:
---
When you put something on the goblin AHs (cross-faction), can each faction see the item in their own faction-only AHs? For example, if I put some silk cloth in a goblin AH as an Alliance member - could Horde see that item in Orgrimmar? Or can you only find that item in cross-faction AHs (goblin AH). 
---
Also, are the deposit costs in cross-faction AH more expensive? 
---
Top voted comment about what PvP servers are like is from a guy that doesn't even play on them.
---
what a bunch of nonsense
---
Your*
---
You're literally the worst person on earth. /s
---
It's on a 30 sec cd, but you can't break fear with it, you gotta precast when you expect it to happen.
---
I wish there were good, non audio censored versions on YouTube.
---
The servers can't handle more players in a single layer than they already have. If they don't have extra layers to put people in, they need to go in a queue.
---
They have spent a lot of time since release to figure out how big they can make the layers.
---
&gt;Wanted to know what happens if you essentially leave an instance you are the owner of, without resetting it.
---
Nothing. You could return and it would be the same instance. No reset.
---
reality is you will just be camping an instance somewhere like the rest of the pvp gods
---
I dunno about that 25% drop rate. I've easily killed over 250 of then and got 6 essence of air.
---
By doing the quest lines that lead to weapon and armor smthing, you get the glimmering mithril insignia, I think it's called making you immune to fear for 30 seconds.
---
This is why layering was the case because the sever cant handle many people in one spot or layer 
---
That still has nothing to do with queues
---
Yeah, realm transfers are tricky
---
scrolled past this post saying that in my head, clicked on comments, was pleased its also top comment. Take my updoot
---
Nice job!
---
Yes they do track it LOOOOL, there is LITERALLY addons made to track how many times you killed somebody, so i REPEAT my self, GET YOUR FACTS STRAIGHT. Ive done this on private servers. Also roll on a fukcin PVE server if you dont like PVP on a PVP server. God damn the cry babies are out in droves huh? PVP not out yet and people are already crying, can you be any MORE pathetic?
---
Honestly it's this retardation being spouted from every hilltop for all eternity that's causing some of the problem. Do horde have technically better racials for pvp? Yes. Does it actually effectively matter in 90%+ of world pvp encounters? No. The better player still wins despite racial disparity. Too bad the majority of the pop thinks they're at an immediate, insurmountable disadvantage in pvp by rolling alliance.
---
Respec full fury and have the highest dps in the game.
---
Or: go fury prot and you can do respectable damage just by wearing full dps gear. 
---
Blindly going deep prot without a raid spot isn't going to work. Go buy an axe of the deep woods and a flurry axe. Run some dungeons and get the necessary hit gear, and have the option of being dps or fury prot by mixing the hit gear in with your tanking gear.
---
No, the Priest just wanted the item and was interpreting his rolls to suit himself.
---
He rolled a 9, you don't get rerolls.
---
Lol this is actually lame wtf is this tiktok?
---
i went for the helm asap and i don't regret it, I mean it's bis the whole game u can always farm gold for epic mount.
---
and imo it depends whether u wanna main pvp or pve. Phase two is comming soon so if u wanna pvp go for epic mount and pve go for lionheart i believe u can get better pvp helms cos u dont need all that hit.
---
So... you rolled on a PvP server and you are now having concerns that you might die to other players (PvP)? Why was this okay and not a concern prior to the announcement of the honor system? The server was a PvP server when you rolled on it -- it didn't magically change. You knew the honor system would be added in time... that has never changed. So what's the point of this post?
---
Ooooh, nevermind. I get it. You're one of those guys that wants to have his cake and eat it too. PvP is cool and all when you're grouped up with a 40 man raid running over destroying groups of 2 and 3 people. However, the second the odds aren't stacked insurmountably in your favor PvP isn't something you like.
---
So you're either trolling here or just a big crybaby. You can play on a PvP server and all that comes with it... meaning large raid-sized battles over control over Blackrock Mountain, small skirmishes fighting over quests or tradeskill resources, or what you call "ganking" is actually everyday world PvP That could be anything from looking for people at flight paths to dungeon zoneouts. But take off your tinfoil hat because camping some random level 35 idiot at the zone-in to Scarlet Monastery could quite possibly be the worst way of farming honor that ever existed. Have you even done your research on how the honor system works? ...or you could just play on a PvE server where none of that exists. You **cannot**, however, play on a server where you get to make the rules on when and where you get to PvP and with which opponents. The closest to that you can come is called "dueling". It's popular out in front Orgrimmar. Don't mistake it for real PVP though.
---
So this has to be a troll post, right? Or am I completely misunderstanding you? You say you haven't been frustrated by getting ganked yet... but then you also mention wasting 5 minutes because someone pressed 3 buttons on their keyboard. It clearly frustrates you, probably because you were not the one in control 
---
Take my advice. Reroll on a PvE server. Flight paths and other choke points will probably be heavily contested until BGs are released. But no one is going to go out of their way to camp some level 45 shitter trying to zone out and reset Scarlet Monastery. If you researched the honor system at all you would know that people farming honor are going to be looking for a large number of kills, not chasing down someone 20 levels below them and spending all afternoon sittting on their corpse. Jesus christ. Yeah, take your paranoid, tinfoil hat, conspiracy theory ass to a PvE server. You'll be better off for it. And all the people on your server will thank me for it. Lol @ you crying to random people in SM about PvP happening on a PvP server.   
---
I've done my good deed. This guy will be happy. The other people on his faction will be happy. I'm like a matchmaker.
---
Then let people who enjoy the entire game have their PVP.
---
It's [Robin of Locksley](https://youtu.be/NRIgKTFczas?t=89)
---
I thought about that as well but Deathbringer does so much more damage than Mirah's Song. I can't imagine Mirah's being the better off-hand. 
---
if you consider weapon damage and speed, Deathbringer would be the way to go i think but then again i cant make much use of the racial which would be a big benefit. If i take Brutality Blade for the main-hand i dont have to worry about that und could use gloves for stats but maybe im missing out on potentially DPS by using the "better" main-hand weapon as off-hand.
---
I use the regular raid frames.
---
And soulstones, coe for more mage dps, summons for lazy people. Plus the coolness factor of having warlocks in your raid 😎
---
What server do you play on?
---
The only LGBT I want rights for is LIBERTY-GUNS-BEER-TITTIES. Yeehaw and GOD BLESS AMERICA love grandpa.
---
Gosh, even the “knowledgeable” vanilla players were utterly clueless. I think it’s safe to say that nobody know wtf they were doing in Vanilla, literally nobody.
---
New player here. Can’t decide what server to start on. I would like to play on EU PVE server as undead priest and start my journey from there but I don’t know what option out of the 3 is the best. I’ve heard one of them was heavily influenced by spanish community that doesn’t really speak english. Is it the case or I can pick randomly and be good to go?
---
Yep I fully regret it. I’ve always played WoW on PVE servers and never felt like I was ‘missing out’, but was covinced to go PVP for that ‘authentic’ classic experience this time around. Maybe it’s me but I don’t see the whole ‘rush of not knowing when your next gank is going to come from!’ appeal, I personally don’t see anything fun with waiting for a lvl 60 to stop teabagging my corpse so I could salvage whatever limited playtime I have left every night to do things I initially wanted to do. I’ve just hit lvl 50 as well so it’s going to be especially more brutal with Phase 2 coming.
---
If they offered paid transfers to other servers I’d jump on it, I don’t really have the time or patience to reroll another toon on a new server.
---
yeah, been a constant 42-50 g here, not enough alchemists i guess
---
Arcane is better but unless your raid is seriously strapped for dps you can raid in any spec you want.
---
I mean you dont understand the itemization of the raids and world bossses if you think this is a good idea

&gt;Let's be honest here, no one gives a crap who was first to clear some random boss, if it wasn't the end boss.
---
Yes, we absolutely give a crap about that. Saying that horde had it easier or was better at something just because 1-2 exceptional horde guilds managed to get to the top (in very few selective criterias) among the other \~90% alliance guilds is just an objectively wrong statement.
---
If e.g. rhetorically 9 out of 10 of the top dps fury warriors on alliance were all human using swords/maces, but for some reason simply due to a little more effort or due to insane crit/proc luck during relevant parses, the #1 recorded dps was a gnome warrior, would you then also say "gnomes are better fury dps than humans, cuz the #1 is a gnome and people only care about that"?
---
Maybe just roll on a PVE server

true experience with recount in 2019!

I don't think you are. There are many who feel the way you do.

6/8 shadowcraft plus devilsaur is bis for a long time until you have most T1 pieces.

Work full time. Hit 59 tonight on my main.

Only 2 BiS.
---
I'm a failure.
---
I think you will be surprised, people really do not like losing and when they lose and lose and lose and lose they will simply transfer away or quit. Then underpopulated faction will lose even more because it's losing players constantly, all of a sudden you have an empty faction on one side 
---
i'm guessing most of pro pvp people in this thread including you are playing horde and most of the people worried about this are alliance
---
Are you sure? In the 2nd post he mentioned that the trolls attack him if he gets too close.
---
Fear immunity trinket.
---
Racists
---
I suspect paladins were originally balanced based off the fact that they only had 5 minute single target blessings. So half your time spent inside a fight would just be rebuffing people. Then Blizzard gave them the 15m class-wide blessings so they could actually spend their time and mana in combat healing people, catapulting them way ahead of shamans in usefulness.
---
What the fuck is this depressed cunt on about
---
nope same here ... I always tended to have a char for every role .. right now my wl is 56 for dps .. got my warri on 51 for tanking and a lvl 37 shammy for healing .. all of them have different professions ...
---
I cant see myself  getting bored anytime soon .. even if they wouldnt release phases ..
---
and even IF all my chars are 60 .. there are so many challenges you can set for yourself / and or things to do 
---
people like OP are likely those who have 200+ games in the steamlib but complain they have "nothing to play"
---
I actually was thinking about this today. 
---
I know unless I can get my alt-horde hunter to 55~ in 8 days i'll probably just drop him. Even if it means not playing with the nicest most friendly guild i've ever been apart of
---
I don't want to deal with even more ganking then I already have.
---
I believe the only emote to be removed from the game was one of the male trolls /silly as it was a drug reference.
---
I once was sapped right when I entered a dungeon and was then CC'd inside the dungeon.
---
spell batching giveth and spell batching taketh away.
---
"No no, he's an asshole.. just an asshole that's good at the game." - my friends ;).
---
Why would you farm honor on targets that give no honor? Sick of all the stupid ass posts on this subreddit about how they work 3 jobs and have 5 kids and can spend 20mins a week playing wow and because of that it's releasing too fast.
---
I know of a Dwarfpriest on Pyrewood Village too
---
Anybody who likes spellbatching is mentally challenged.
---
&gt;All they have to do is increase the sever capacity so the server can handle all the people in one layer without crashing
---
It's not that easy. This doesn't take in to account that the world has limited resources. Even with Dynamic respawns, they can't handle 2 or 3 times the number of players the world is designed to support.
---
I believe they said realms that still had many players when phase 2 hit would experience queues.
---
Neither is worth it. Sadly shadowfoot stabber for pvp and barman for pve for MH and bonescraper/distracting for OH unless you re gonna get alcor's.
---
Heartseeker isnt worth it. Enchant shadowfoot stabber with +5 and you re better off.
---
Pre raid daggers are all shit. Even gutgore isn't good but its the best you can get before perdition's blade.
---
Phase two will probably make me drop my 30-something Horde pvp server alt. Even if I don't want to.
---
I don't see the fun in being camped from 48-60 by some honor farming hunter or rogue. 
---
I'll just go back to my "baby" pve server and actually play the game i pay 15/month for.
---
Why would they release content slower than it originally released. That makes literally 0 sense. It shouldn't take like 4 years to go through 2 years of 15 year old content on the final super nerfed patch.
---
Haha, this guy thinks life isn't an illusion.
---
Deathbringer isn't the better main-hand weapon for humans, period. The reason I already stated before. And because off-hand attack damage gets cut in half, the difference between mirah's and deathbringer isn't as big. And this is ignoring the whole weapon skill part.
---
If you want to simulate the theoretical dps between the pieces, go to the Fight Club -discord and use their spreadsheet. You'll see that deathbringer really isn't that great for humans.
---
dwarf is badass tho
---
&gt;originally balanced
---
that's the thing with Classic, it wasn't balanced. They didn't have the tools, time and experience necessary to balance anything.
---
Makes what worse? Give the dude a break. Its a verry social game. Discussing social topics is what we need to do here.
---
Thanks for the help! Seems like you should rarely put items on the neutral AH. Should’ve asked this before I spent nearly 2g on deposit costs in Booty bay lol
---
Specific pieces are still bis. It's just that a less optimal piece can drop elsewhere and titanforge to be better than the base stats of your bis. It's like playing Diablo, grinding out a single dungeon to get that one specific piece to drop, then it also has to titanforge, so like a 1% chance. It'd be like trying to farm an ironfoe or felstriker for every slot
---
random fireballs from fire elementals and ragnaros come to mind... as a consequence i always buff up with fire prot flask for raggy and fire ward+frost shield for these damn fire elementals, which can easily oneshot me with pre raid bis glass cannon gear.
---
The DPS is higher for everyone, because classes and items everyone is wearing got buffed. You can't evade being a lot more effective than you would have been in vanilla. So unless you put in a lot less effort than people did in vanilla, Vael will be a lot easier.
---
Sure there will be guilds unable to get past him, but the same is true for basically any content in the game. In any case Vael won't be the crusher of guilds he was back then. Not even remotely close. So if you still remember him that way, the difference will be rather jarring. Just like killing Ragnaros before first sons in dungeon blues is.
---
Uh, when you're a caster, for example?
---
Ofc it's not easy at all. I was not saying anything against that because our topic was something different :) 
---
Ya it will be hard to handle everyone in one layer especially on full servers.
---
This is why layering was good to separate these huge amount of people into nicely populated layers. 
---
We will see what happens on p2, if they dont increase the capacity on servers the high pop servers will be a lagging shitshow
---
Also I only play every other day or so. I have a real busy life kid. I'm still confident I'm a better player than you, I don't need to put much effort in this game like you have to.
---
Noggenfogger EU
---
For leveling bow speed doesn't really matter honestly. Take whichever has the highest dps listing.
---
You only need to worry about the speed of weapons as a hunter at 50+ if you went the standard BM/MM route. and even then you don't really need to care.
---
This is a ridiculous scenario to try to prove AoE tanking doesn't work. If I joined a group and the tank says "hey we doing AoE pulls here" and me being a mage says "my best DPS option here is to spam frost bolt". There's a player who isn't going to be good in any situation. A mage who push hard on DPS, in fact any DPS pushing hard on the get-go is going to be an issue no matter what, I'm not sure what your point is.
---
This seems to be an ongoing theme, someone brings up how to AoE tank, everyone and their mother brings up the most a "what if" scenario. Let's just look at the bottom line: AoE tanking is a real thing because it's been proven to work in many situations (low-level healer, no tank gear, multiple specs, different compositions). When pulled off it is way more efficient than traditional tanking/groups. Literally everyone's argument vs any form of AoE tanking is "well what if bad player does this", why would you cater to bad players, why not expect better of the players, and even if you want to always consider the worst players then what about your guild runs? Do you still run a full UBRS run vice a 5-man to get the last few pieces? do you still do 5-man BRD arena/anger runs when people are doing 2 and 3 man runs?
---
People are doing AoE tanking, and pulling it off in pugs. We aren't even talking about guild runs. Between Properly executed AoE runs and traditional runs, the AoE run is far more efficient. There will be bad players no matter what, catering it to them makes no sense.
---
We already started the game with nerfed MC so what patch notes do you wanna see?
---
Well, that and a bit of luck. We have 3 hunters in our mainstay raid team: 6/8, 7/8 and 8/8.
---
Warlocks just dropped their second BoE
---
Thrash + Mirah's &gt; Dal Rend &gt; Vis Kag + Brutality.
---
Everything else is a waste of gold and time.
---
You can get a fire resistance buff by mind-controlling priests in LBRS to buff the raid. Takes a while, but is definitely worth it.
---
Many servers are so faction unbalanced that it renders it impossible for the minoirty faction to farm anything.
---
Felpaw village for Timbermaw rep is a good example. On my server the horde controls the area completely, and enforce it too.
---
Yeah this. Sure there will be hotspots for PvP but some people think that when you log in there is already 100 opposite faction players who just corpse tbag and corspe camp you.
---
BGs aren't going to be very fun for the vast majority of shitty geared melees.
---
Check out aux as well. Its my favorite now. More powerful than auctionator and more intuitive than auctioneer and tsm.
---
Agree.
---
Very few people do anything in this game "for fun" this time around.
---
Its all about min maxing. No one wants to run a dungeons once they got their items.
---
Only way to have avoided this would be to redo all items / drops, but that would be a pain in the arse.
---
Its a real shame as it kinda erodes the community and fun aspects.
---
Healing is boring af
---
You dont get it. Yes item X might be your Bis but if item Y rolls a socket or titanforges then titem Y might be better than item X. Doesnt change the fact that if Item X will always be better than item Y if it rolls the same things (aka titanforge or socket). What you need to sim is your current gear, its hard to know what gear in your Inventory is currently the best gear because of all of the RNG, but that doesnt make the item BiS. BiS are specific items and if those specific items titanforge and have sockets they will be BiS regardless of other items titanforging or getting sockets.
---
I give you an example. Imagine like how Lionhearths helm is Bis for Fury warriors in classic and imagina that titanforging is in classes. Now you got your lionhearth helm but t2 helm dropped for you and it titanforged with a socket. Now its better than your lionhearth helm sure but its not BiS. BiS for you is still a lionhearth helm that would titanforge and socket too. BiS means BiS and not what im in your bags is currently best. So you wouldnt out there be farming all kinds of helms hoping that they titanforge and get a socket, making them better than base lionhearth helm. Instead you will be chasing a lionhearth helm that titanforges and has a socket because that helm is BiS.
---
I remember vanilla being exotic as being not only a dwarf priest but a female one at that. Now they're everywhere!
---
The BiS are different although I dont know them because I dont care about pvp. The main difference is that stamina is really nice in PvP and near worthless in PvE.
---
stealing that hahaha
---
Yeah...my action bars are basically already at capacity though.  I’d just like some sort of pop out menu that contains all of these
---
We normally have 2 healers. For the boss hunter just kites him away into the previous room while we deal with ads. When ads die or he's in trouble hunter feigns and tank picks up boss when he comes back. IDK what spec our tanks run but whatever it is they do the tanking well.
---
If phases continue at this speed naxx will be out next August.
---
With some effort, most classes can actually solo many packs in level 60 dungeons. It is not required at all to tank everything, more like just hard hitting mobs and ones trying to rush healer.
---
Yeah. Enchants happen seperate from other on-hits. Stuff like paladin seals, shaman windfury and rogue poisons are also 'chance on hits' that stack with enchants and other effects.
---
If you have a little gold to spend (2-8 on my server) grab the second-highest weapon damage enchant. If you've got more and really wanna stomp some low level content, get fiery weapon. It procs often and 40 damage is a lot in the ~15-20's, which is usually where you can start to pick up rare weapons that'll last a while.
---
Imagine WOTF needed to be cast before the fear to work, could be dispelled, and was only available to priests.
---
FW is not better.
---
This was my thought as well... warrior tanks, pala and priest healers and then mage, warlock, rogue, warriors for dps... sounds pretty damn strong to me hehe
---
Wouldn’t dueling be just as good to find out who is good at pvp?
---
Yes thats what i said. In retail BiS lists still exist, its just unrealistic that you will ever be equipped in BiS gear because other items will just titanforge and be better and you wont be lucky to get your BiS item titanforged for all slots. But still at release there will be a BiS list and if i want a ring i will be chasing that specific ring and hoping that it titanforges, i might never get a titanforged version and be forces to use another one. But its the onw i will be chasing because its BiS
---
Focus more on stamina and int and less on spell power (obviously still grab some). Lots of nice Shadow PvP pieces drop in Scholomance. So that might be worth checking out.
---
There are no lists that I know of, so you'll have to do a little research by yourself.
---
Idk I guess it just depends on the person. I can maintain the fury rotation without even thinking about it much so this adds a mini game, making it a bit more interesting.
---
Man this brings back one of my very, very earliest memories in WoW... trying to climb the Coldridge mountains, getting high up before I fell, precipitously, and landing in one of these camps. I was maybe 6 or 7 at the time, and I ran to my dad saying "I found Horde in Coldridge valley!!!" All these years later and it's finally come true.

The only delusional people in this sub is anyone that thinks anything Blizzard does at this point is anything but garbage. 
---
New Xpac for WoW looks like a shallow cash grab built on nothing but nostalgia. D4 looks like it's trying it's absolute hardest to trick people into thinking it's D2 yet they're going to continue to make it mandatory online for PC players which was the main sticking point of why people hated D3 and what caused so many of its problems. 
---
OW2 is a ""new game"" that's ONLY exclusive feature is the story mode that people have been asking for since OW1 launched and seems to be the only thing set to justify its purchase price rather than simply being a patched in feature. 
---
HotS is fucking dead, like actually dead, and yet they didn't even bother to tell it's eSports scene about it prior to the general public completely fucking them over till the absolute last second 
---
And the general state of their PR being absolute dog shit reassuring everyone that they are a morally bankrupt company top to bottom.
---
Classic is currently the ONLY redeeming quality to take away from them at this point lol
---
I’ve farmed these a lot. The actual drop rate is under 10%, I’d say 5ish %
---
If you hit 1600 frostbolts on random dungeon mobs they will be dead before they reach you..
---
Arenas made the game smaller and pvp to be a smallscale. sure it made pvp easier for a small group, but it took away to much and made arenas obsolete.  
---
And arenas would never work with the honor system. it worked in and after TBC because honor system was removed from the game.
---
Ummmm, the tank fury meta comes from the top pserver guilds and starts with a bwl geared tank to allow for more damage.
---
Yes, I felt that way too and rerolled my lvl 50 horde mage from a 60/40 h:a server to human rogue on a 50/50 server (Ashbriner EU). Honestly, because alliance players are just worse (on average), I was winning pretty much every pvp encounter as a mage, with most of the times allies not even fighting back - it got kinda boring, so I decided to give myself more of a challenge.
---
Thy is happened to me in that yeti cave.  MC’d by an Allie priest who then buffed me.
---
I'm playing on Heartstriker. I don't know what you're talking about. ;)
---
dude ppl under lv60 are subhumans
---
You mean fear ward for onyxia?   WF totem lets us do more damage but salvation does so much for threat it really isn't funny.
---
I've heard around that too from guildies who have farmed them - usually people are saying around 2-5%
---
All of those ally guilds are US, so I think the bigger factor is the +1 day raiding US guilds get.
---
not always man, sometimes it's just that their class counters yours and that's that

i am tanking for me guild, but i am druid not a warrior and i have the option to have hybrid talents so i can be proper dps and tank.  I still feel like there is advantage if being a tank when servers are new and not all people are 60, you can make easy money doing dungeons . you find party basically instantly and i feel it is easier than dpsing in dungeon
---
Cry about what? Assholes not using their abilities and wiping groups because they ninja pull?
---
At least try riding most of the post before going in on people.
---
I said, *as* I was charging in. 
---
Charge &gt; Zerker/Zerker &gt; WW &gt; D-stance &gt; Bloodrage &gt; Tab Sunder &gt; Taunt the one you let get a little away. Cycle Revenge on lowest threat.
---
You had me at the first half.
---
2handed is best done with weapon swap macros so you can switch stance, do a 2hand move, then switch stance back along with your weapon.
---
Looking dope!  
---
Got a pvp pre-BIS list for shamans? I haven't been able to find a proper one...
---
It lasts long enough?
---
Explained in my other comment to you.
---
I mean I've been pugging it for 4 weeks because I've had a scheduling conflict with the guild raid.
---
Never not had a pug kill rag.
---
There's enough alchemists but people refuse to pay meaningful gold for the CD.
---
Shazzrah Alliance, bars go for 55-60, mats for 50-55. I'm not selling 48h CD for 5 gold (or nothing with AH cut).
---
Even a five-year old is better than me at this game
---
the queues never stopped, 2h+ every single day starting around 3pm
---
Thats because all items in retail are literally the same (unfortunatelly). Like every golves of the same itemlevel have the exact same amount of primary stats, stamina and secondary stats. Only which kind of secondary stats change but the amounts are the same. So of course you just have too look at what stats are on the item. Imagine if items in classic were like that. Imagine if every gloves in MC had the same amount of stats on it, wouldnt be hard to figure out what is BiS. The gloves that have in and spellpower woul be BiS for all casters for instance.
---
This is one of my biggest problems with retail, the items are so bland.
---
THE PATCH NOTES FROM VANILLA WHICH SHOW HOW MC WAS NERFED
---
WF is more fun, but alliance is easier.
---
35, 36 have been my bottlenecks. I just step away from the game and come back a few days later.

for a 50 priest, what's better:

---
Why is combat that good for leveling?
---
Why not Subtlety or Assa? Assa i know it's more for lvl 60 or so, Sub tho i don't know enough.
---
As for **Professions**? In my guild they said **DE** \+ **Mining**, why? I can do **DE** with a lvl 5 Alt, isn't wasted on a class i want to lvl up? Mining i'll do for sure since it's a good income of money and i plan to do Engi at 60, still the other profession which should be? mining and?
---
I would throw that cat away which touches the screen like that.
---
unless you are a "crafter" for your guild, there is nothing to gain from blacksmithing. That trinket is not good since as as a warrior you have other means to break fear.   
---
But for FC Druid, that trinket is amazing.
---
WOTF will help more on Onyxia than FW unless you got like 7 dwarf priests and want to buff tons of people. 
---
WF does so much more damage than it really isn't funny. This Horde circlejerking about them having it soooooo hard should not have survived 2005.
---
One day you'll have a proper job and they'll release some classic version of wrath or something and you will be on the other side of the coin.
---
Disagree slightly, WotLk from launch as a whole. 
---
Dungeons in Vanills were hard, to a point levelling dungeons still are. The initial raids can be difficult, if geared poorly for which many of us were the first time around. TBC launch raids were Brutal, even in some pro-bis gear, Gruul was unforgiving and Magtheridon cut out the slack. 
---
Then in WotLK - everyone walked into Naxx, everyone walked into Obsidian Sanctum. The only  vote worthy fight, was Sarth10-3D. It set off the wrong foot, raids should require dedication and preparation.
---
 Gosh, even the “knowledgeable” vanilla players were utterly clueless. I think it’s safe to say that nobody knew what they were doing in Vanilla, literally nobody.
---
It's not only interesting for nostalgic reasons, phase 2 ranking is the only actual "hardcore" content in classic.
---
Wholesome.
---
wahhhh wahhhh wahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh reddit validate me
---
Depends on a server, yes. There are mages unions with an attempt to spamreport any other mage who offers portal service less than 1g as well kek.
---
I don’t know about you but we didn’t play on patches that weren’t even out yet. We are doing so much damage because of talent reworks of patch 1.12 that came out in Naxx. Unless you are some time traveler or started playing at the very end of vanilla, no we did not do this type of damage back then.
---
Everyone knows that, the begger wants to train more then 1 weapon skill which then 50 silver makes sense
---
&gt; Tanks were NEVER designed to hold aggro on 3+ mobs equally as DPS AoE.
---
Tell that to a Prot Paladin.
---
fuck this made me laugh at my lecture class this is awkward
---
Ok, I should have said "Items that are better then leveling or blue dungeon items". The trinket is mandatory, yes, all other items beside the set is vendor trash.
---
yep! I wish Spy would let me add a note for the KoS list, because by the time I’m 60 I’m not gonna remember how half these people made me angry lol
---
This, Riposte is the key talent here.
---
How hard is it to understand that it's not a *HORDE ADVANTAGE* when you solve it with THREE hunters?!
---
Is it possible to disable/remove the Sun/Moon icon (cycles of day) near Minimap?
---
Actually, it does. 😎
---
All MMOs are hardcore. You just have a gamer's perspective.
---
yeah that was my original point, they can't get rid of layering within the next week
---
Started leveling recently but 30-34 as a rogue was terrible, no movement speed, and terribly low dps, lead me to buying 2 maces from ah, and speccing mace. Haven't looked back since and am currently blasting.
---
It will still be BiS for all eternity, so what's the issue here? It doesn't even matter what you do, it's best for dungeons and it's best for raiding - no matter if you have a spot or doing pickup groups.
---
The reason all that crap happened was because of arena and a misguided idea that WoW arenas were an export.
---
I mean they give a shitton of stamina, more than any other blue item
---
Yes, but that's a different case from a population size issue. In fact, since OP posts his own faction capital being overpopulated, his own example is reversed.
---
Are we comparing it to old MMOs are just games in general?
---
I’m surprised you didn’t have to take a break or two to type out a complete sentence! Great job, sport! You’re finally learning!
---
&gt; If you happened to crit shadowbolt a couple a times in a row then rip.
---
No, then: 
---
1. Your tank sucks
---
2. You suck
---
Because either way you shouldn't be so high on threat that one crit will pull aggro.
---
they really have to remove this ridiculous spell batching thing
---
&gt; Why is combat that good for leveling?
---
It provides you with plenty of useful tools that stay useful regardless of the weapon you end up chosing. Hit, OH damage, Riposte, Weapon Skill, Eviscerate Damage, Blade Flurry &amp; Adrenalin Rush - all of those are great to have while leveling. The other trees offer very little in comparison, at least when your entire job is to kill mobs as efficiently as possible. 
---
&gt; As for Professions? In my guild they said DE + Mining, why? I can do DE with a lvl 5 Alt, isn't wasted on a class i want to lvl up? Mining i'll do for sure since it's a good income of money and i plan to do Engi at 60, still the other profession which should be? mining and?
---
your asessment of Enchanting is correct. You can skip the 2nd profession entirely or get Skinning, up to you.
---
No you don’t because as of now tanks are a 4th dps. Shit some tanks pull more damage than the other dps so no there is absolutely no reason to ever wait now on retail.
---
&gt;unless you got like 7 dwarf priests
---
Yep?
---
just hit 51 on my rogue, how many hours a day do you think I’ll need to grind/quest in order to hit 60 before phase 2?
---
I prefer the Hand of Righteousness. 11 int doesn't do much, and MP5 is a stat that only really kicks on once you accumulated a fair chunk of it.
---
You can just go 20/31/0 heal just fine in raids and tank like a beast in 5 mans while also easy lasher farm and if you skill imp.sor in holy and reckoning can also be good in 1v1 wpvp Situations.
---
Or you can go 25/26/0 for a netter pvp expirience
---
It entirely was. And I wasn't even in a elitist guild doing firsts or anything.
---
Well. He is true to his name at least.
---
I have this too , but for Caster / Warlocks in particular:
---
\#showtooltip Shoot  
---
/dismount  
---
/petattack  
---
/cast Shoot
---
Well she doesn't know about it at all right now, I could just send her the link and let her see it now or wait until she streams and show her then
---
&gt; at all
---
Wellllll, there HAVE been times the tank dies and I have to evasion tank the boss or mobs :p
---
Well nothing seemed wrong about it. Exploiting a game mechanic yes. I would consider it more along the lines of like a cheese then a glitch
---
Each dwarf priest is the same as 4 undead.   2 minute cd vs a 30 second cd.  Unless you have 20+ undead it is unlikely to be more useful than a handfull of dwarf priests.
---
Neither side really has it hard, but the alliance perks really do make it easier overall.
---
The most hardcore people yeah. The rest of us are playing normally.
---
Get goblin rocket boots, they don't require engineering or level to wear.
---
I felt so bad because I abandoned my pet that I had since Level 30 and actually named after my dog. Saw a really rare elite boar that is basically impossible to tame without a huuuge time Investment so I had to tame him. :(
---
poor dude misread the tooltip.
---
I farmed them yesterday after I hit level 40 on my rogue, killed around 50 of them and only got 1 flame sac. Accoding to wowhead it should have a drop change of 16% but obviously not for me. I also got 1 wicked claw (that has a 2% drop chance). The flame sac sold for 60 silver on my server, so I will give it another try. I still need 50 gold for my mount so this should be the place to be.
---
Lol, watch it be a 100% non-factor this time.
---
There's an add-on called dismount that will automatically do this for you if you're mounted and try to do anything buff, eat, drink, attack etc. The only Annoying Thing is the first click on whatever you click on just Dismount you so you have to get into the Habit while your mounted of clicking everything twice
---
You can click the person name in kos list, and set reason
---
I'd take the +healing power, MP5 is not really an issue, as there aren't any long dragging fights in 5-mans. It starts to get really useful in raids.
---
Thanks, I'm at 47 and I could probably actually find a group to go with at this level (Theradras herself is only level 51. I actually didn't know that initially, I thought Maraudon was a much higher level). I'd been farming ZF in the hopes of getting that mace, but actually the thrash blade would be a much better replacement.

Awww, did poor diddums get killed by the meanie horde? Try one of these servers:
---
Old Blanchy, Ashkandi, Mankrik, Pagle, Westfall, Windseeker.
---
They sound more what a player of your calibre needs.
---
God forbid people just play to dick around n have fun.
---
i want videos!
---
Thanks, I'm currently at 47 so Mirah's might be a slight ways off, but I can definitely get the Thrash blade!
---
I'm certainly hoping to get Dal Rends.....but damn, everyone wants those :p
---
Going without Hunters will be fun at Magmadar. Even full T3 tanks had a rough time dealing with his enrage back in the days...
---
It does matter when I'm going to get hunted in ungoro crater and winter spring.
---
You're confusing stuff. Our DPS was  consistent with what we have then; the spell power stuff was released earlier than 1.12. In 2005 I had all the SP gear that we see today I already.
---
What is true and that you missed: MC in 1.12 is immensely nerfed.
---
If you click on the little Notepad above where all names are listed it will open up a giant menu that will show all the records of win loss times you encounter the player and even coordinates. There's also a blank space that if you click on it you can add a note for example ganked me while fishing kill this bastard whenever you can
---
No.
---
One Protection Paladin with a penchant for pain placates that particular problem.
---
Unless you're Horde, then ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
We did it yesterday, but wiped once. When we ran back, Urok and 2 mobs where still there. We got him without pulling the adds, then got the adds.
---
We were happy though, because we were expecting to have to redo everything.
---
I use Vanas KoS addon
---
Depends on the skill and knowledge of the group. Usually you are fine without it, but in certain cases it really helps. BRD for example has healers in some packs (Anvilrage Marshal), marking them skull for focus makes killing the packs considerably faster.
---
They use the hunter turtle to tank
---
Except salvation buff doesn't run out when the paladin runs out of mana a minute or two into the fight from totem twisting plus doing anything else.
---
Alliance have to work harder for damage and Horde have to work harder for utility.  The other thing of note that is pretty huge that horde don't really have is Blessing of Wisdom.   Yes shamans can use mana tide, but they are almost never in the caster group unless you are in a raid with 6+ shaman.
---
Too much caffiene sorry
---
I like it but hate that they centered class balance around it.
---
I guess roughly 5-6 hours per Level, depending on your leveling speed.
---
Nah humans can't be horde, dealing with the shame of being alliance isn't worth it.
---
Yep, usually said by people using "clever use of mechanics" to convince themselves they aren't exploiting
---
Nope, there is just far less compared to other expansions. 
---
Because they started with the item/talent rework in place MC/ony are way easier than initial raids in TBC/WotLK for example.
---
&gt; U should always be a dwarf priest on alliance...
---
or alternatively, i can't fucking stand dwarf animations or how they look, so.
---
20 more dps. lol. Actually more like 100-200.
---
They have announced it, so it should be happening.
---
What they are going to do with massively overpopulated realms, I have no idea.
---
I'm assuming your realm is still "Layered"  in the realm list and not "Full". I can't recall you mentioning which realm this is.
---
Sssoooo OP, did you buy your first aid books at the AH?
---
yes I do.  the game keeps it for me if it makes them red they're KOS.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
**&lt;Wanderlust&gt; [Alliance] Nethergarde Keep | English language**
---
**Our Philosophy:**
---
No rush, no mandatory guides. We would like to experience the game to the fullest by taking our time and trying our hands at things our way. (This should be taken as "for the first few times", for fun and flavor. We are not overzealous.)  We know this will take a lot of time but we are fine with it.
---
Progression. Although we should be relaxed and not rush anywhere, we should progress through all content eventually. Wipes on first tries of raids are completely expected but eventually we should learn them and clear them efficiently. The same goes for characters. Anything which works reliably for progression will be fine.
---
**Who are we looking for:**
---
Anyone wishing to experience the whole game in a relaxed but mature atmosphere and who is prepared to take it slow with us. Focus is on reliability, which means that when it comes to raiding, people should show up and perform sufficiently. You don't need to know stuff or be good at the game now, just be willing to improve and get good enough.
---
**Raiding related information:**
---
* We'll start raiding when everyone is ready (within reason).
---
* Likely one 40 man per week, most likely around 19-23 CET. Raid times are up for discussion still. (Plus optional 20 mans when they come out.)
---
* Loot council, for reliable progression as a guild.
---
Anyone interested, message me!
---
They are short so attacks miss them more often.
---
Why can't it be the other way? "You made a conscious decision to burn out on the content in this classic rerelease with finite content instead of playing properly and taking your time. MMOs aren't for you."
---
Nope. Higher ranks increase nothing but your movement speed, which is honestly all it really needs to improve.
---
There are a variety of ways to improve your stealthiness, but, especially early on, MoD is the best option in that regard.
---
I'm not sure if it's worth dumping all five points into. I've seen people argue in favor of 2/5 and 3/5, though, which I feel like should make for a good minimum, seeing as 0/5 makes it dang-near impossible to get as close as within 15 yards of your enemy without being detected, thus making you lose your openener (and, if deep-ish sub, the biggest damage factor in your rotation).
---
Right now if you want more hit +%, you're gonna have to use items that are lackluster in other stats, such as the Truestrike Shoulders missing raw stats or critical strike. Later raid gear will have bunch of other stats that even if you were to exceed the yellow hit cap, you will want to wear them. Items like Chromatic Boots or the AQ40 warrior shoulders for example.
---
Guilds were killing Rag pre-submerge with green crap because the tank on rag figuratively shits aggro and it's not a concern.
---
A single fire ward is enough to survive anything other than living bomb crit or ragnaros.
---
I bet you will get a lot of warlock and druid loot!
---
I don't think sap works in MC or at least I've never seen a raid use sap in MC
---
He isn't, trolls attack him as well. He and his allies are trying to mimic the appearance of the mobs with the blue/green hair so that unsuspecting alliance players think they're mobs or some glorious named rare spawns and accidentally hit them.
---
No, the people who make themselves most deserving of gear should get the most gear.
---
It's so funny to me how everyone is refering to the " nolifers " as this rare unicorn that make up 1% of the playerbase. But If you really want to include everyone how is 60 and got most of his gear by now as a nolifer I think that definition is pretty watered down. 
---
I got my 60 geared and currently leveling an alt ( lvl 48 atm ) I play on Gehennas-EU arguably one of the most populated servers and let me tell you the leveling Zones are pretty much " dead ", at least in comparison to the ammount players on this server. So it seems to me that the "casual players" a far more few and between then the good ol' nolifers.
---
Getting downvoted but it's true. It's important to make real connections and real memories with people.
---
Mages decurse on 3 fights and sheep on Domo. Also a lot of people use the deep frost mage to ice block pull garr
---
546 runs atm, never seen it..
---
Yes, way better System would be only People that actually tag the specific mob to get a DK
---
You will have to do Damange and be fine with Offtanking.
---
hey man, don't under estimate the Night Elf racials, they've come in handy more then once, especially on a PVP server.
---
Shadowmelding to avoid 60s waltzing by, Elune's Grace to RNG-dodge certain mechanics (and also reduce Hunter damage by a pretty decent portion)... and Female NE's also have the best animations and aesthetics of the priests.
---
The content is the world, the levelling, the interactions with people. It's not necessarily the endgame raids.
---
On our server, the two guilds Alliance-side that were deep in BWL had to coordinate our Nefarian attempts because if we both tried it at once the server started shitting its pants and pings went a little nuts.
---
Naturally this led to evil shenanigans while we were going for server firsts.
---
The wisdom is always in the replies of replies
---
This would suck with the current classes being unbalanced.
---
Feel like if you're at the stage where one more shadowbolt crit is going to pull aggro, you shouldn't cast that shadowbolt!
---
My first mc was bugged or something and we never got tranq shot and we still did magmadar without a wipe. Pretty sure no one was in full prebis and we had a couple 58 healers even
---
I don't think that they are. You just think the people you interact with in the game regularly are representative of the larger player base. Most haven't set foot in a raid.
---
Why not both? Classic currently lacks one even compared to vanilla.
---
I am totally going to use /doh on anyone who dies trying to attack me from now on!
---
We tank all adds at once on one tank burst gar and then bomb the adds
---
You have been had.
---
Time to make our own troll  clan
---
You two are pretty damaged if that's the first thing you want to focus on in a fantasy game
---
Haha okay. Let's see how you cope without eating.
---
The problem is unless a dps is actively watching a (working) threathmeter, he wont know if he is above the second, third or fourth tank in the list before its too late. Anyone being above one of the 3-4 tanks at vael will most likely cause a wipe due to his mechanics.
---
Judging from personal experiences raiding with multiple guilds or watching streams, the majority of dps players right now are incapable of doing that fight and still believe its the tanks fault if they pulled aggro.
---
And why wouldn't a loot council be able to take that into account, among other things, when deciding where a piece of loot should go?
---
I run DM regularly and always like to get rid of the doomguard pets ASAP. I have to mark literally every target, because if I mark skull on something else, that dies--understandable, but come on, if I do the pattern like 3x, let me skip the 4th--or if I dont mark anything, all DPS will target individual things. Honestly, I feel like core hound groups have been ridiculously easy because DPS seem to naturally pick individual targets to DPS and will almost never actually focus unless you tell them to.
---
Y its definitely not interesting anymore. Also more toxicity cause of this. I shelved classic for now.
---
That's hillarious!
---
I remember when Arugal was still having multiple hour queues a couple of weeks after launch and Remulos didn't have a queue after about day 3 (or if it did it was maybe 15minutes tops).
---
That's hard core guilds going for speed clears, still not normal even for geared guilds
---
This. Arena should be completely sepperate from the rest of the game. Dueling is much more organic.
---
Arena games just don't fit the theme of WoW imho, and shifting ballance and class design just so Arenas work is not good.
---
If you want to go hardcore and test skill vs other players WoW is the wrong game anyway.
---
This. So much this. More than before, classes started getting more streamlined and far less unique because "every class needs to be able to X and Y" to be somewhat competitive in arena. No, this is not something that should be added in.
---
You've proved that hardcore players are more organised and have more access to information. The rest of us are playing the game pretty much the same.
---
Ofcourse it will be viable for a tiny fraction of the player base, but for most players its simply too advanced.
---
I found it funny at the time? Why else?
---
Quickly, fast enough dps and he isn't an issue
---
&gt;Alliance have to work harder for damage and Horde have to work harder for utility.
---
There you go. None have it easier.
---
Blessing of Wisdom means a ret pal, means a guy not doing any meaningful DPS. Furthermore, you need to hit the boss to profit from it, meaning no mana for healers.
---
Mana tide requires no guy doing shit DPS and profits the healers. You gloss over the fact that Horde healers all get a free Innervate per fight very quickly. This is INSANE for healers.
---
Wisdom judgement does nothing for most DPS classes; potions and demonic runes are enough.
---
Your raid team is a self selecting sample of people.
---
DPS dont like killing nonelites first, unless they are in a group, in which case, they wont even wait until it has gotten to the tank spot. Go run DM E and see how often groups will kill the mini lashers at the end before the big one--meaning the tank has to continue AoE threat on the mini lashers, while DPS is going full on threat on the big lasher.
---
&gt;3-4 tanks per 40 man raid group is a very real bottleneck
---
yep .... :( and even then, when you end up being the 4th or 5th tank in an MC run, you spend most of the time just trying to dps with your tank spec, and even hunters out-dps you (sorry, huntards), and when there's finally a fight where you're required to tank like majordomo or phase 2 ragna, it's for 2 minutes max
---
Felika been my girl since vanilla. I always ran into her before reaching the alchemy shop so I just bought all my vials from her.
---
So you're saying fury tank is not really optimal right now for progression raids? Just what I said.
---
This 100%, the pve shadow unfortunately does not line up with pvp shadow almost at all. The only point of contention I have is swapping the blackout points for spirit tap, and the reasoning behind that is the same reasoning behind impact being banned from raids. 
---
There are many scenarios where you have explicit stun rotations. Some examples are sartura adds, C’Thun large eye tentacles, and Naxx ghoul trash when they enrage. Random stuns are on a different DR from targetted stuns like hoj, but they are on the same DR as kidney. Most stun rotations abuse the different dr’s for a full hoj into kidney for 11 seconds into backup intercepts, concs, or vanish cs’s but the point is that blackout will eat up the DR on your target, which is very very very bad.
---
Is it true the faction balance is horrible on Arugal?
---
In dungeons? None, you just start blasting
---
This is why you roll Tauren for warstomp
---
I use VanasKos addon and write the place where I fought them / some other reason so I remember better who am  i dealing with.
---
One of my favorite addons.
---
Please dont give them any ideas. Literally, blizzard might listen and do this.
---
Unfortunately a lot of the people claiming to enjoy "pvp" are just people looking to ruin the gameplay experience of people not interested in engaging in pvp. This is why there's so much instance portal camping in blackrock mountain: It's a place people are going in large numbers to do something other than pvp, so that makes it a target rich environment.
---
Most of these same players are also the same ones that run away as soon as someone who is actually interested in pvp shows up, because someone actually interested in engaging people who fight back will basically always mop the floor with people who only "pvp".
---
Whenever I hear someone say they love world pvp, but hate battlegrounds, all I hear is "I only enjoy fighting players who aren't interested in fighting back".
---
Yes I use spy and it has several people on it who ganked me while levelling.. When I find one of those persons I gank em till they log out... Because the lowly rogue they ganked now hits like a jackhammer
---
Agreed, that's what I am doing. Bought edgies and almost done gathering the mats for Lionheart helm.
---
Look at that!
---
A goblin who can spell!
---
Is there an addon count all skills/spells you use over a certain time? I am trying to optimize my keybinds, and want to know how frequently I use what.
---
I’ve killed thousands of eles in silithus, the drop rate is about 3% for essences
---
Yep.. also ''Gnomemage'' for warlock
---
Simple fix. They buff the content.
---
Have done 7 MC since lvl 60, have gotten 3 tier1 pieces as druid. our guild is getting like 80% mage loot, its absolutely ridic, our mages got more tier1 than the druids.
---
There's plenty of ways to level still, just do dungeons for example.
---
STV being a shitshow is a huge part of the game, I can't even imagine why anyone would want to neuter their experience so much as to change that.
---
We just have completely different experiences. We were considered pretty hardcore on our server since we cleared all the current content pretty fast and had them on farm but I don't think most of our DPS were bothered to grab world buffs and flasks before every raid. I don't remember any other guild doing that either except for progression

I´m not sure if anyone should give you attention. The post is just to give people some insight that if you keep calm everything will be better. Nothing more, nothing less.

It can usually happen with any human NPC, but for me it was this lad -  [https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=11863/azore-aldamort](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=11863/azore-aldamort)
---
Most bis lists on wowhead are straight wrong... Most guilds are still 8/10...nobody knows how onyxia threat works, ir you eant challenge try clear MC in under 1 hour
---
tank is never UD though
---
Looks like I’d have to be a human for a mage. May just be a Hunter. 5 Hunters could be fun 🤣
---
You're a wholesome dwarf pal. Gratz on the rep. Im on 4k/21 for darna and way less on wintersaber trainers LUL
---
gladiator isn't rank 14 glad took skill not time LOL.  also I quit in wotlk so no I only dominated pvp when pvp was good. sorry not everyone is bad like you.  stay small
---
Yeah blessing is OP for sure.Shamans do have tranquility totem which is 15% reduction good in raids but i  see them being rarely used .And you need one in your group
---
Am I a bad parson for corpse camping someone who's just there to camp people 20+ levels lower than him?
---
I feel like its kind of justified. Might be wrong though...
---
i was arms tanking everything up until I had to tank MC. The metric tons of shit I had to deal with because of that ....
---
&gt; PvP has never been the focus of WoW
---
Pvp is what makes classic great.  Classic without pvp is a completely different game.
---
That’s not Damage done, it is mana gained. Warlocks are obviously on the top because of all the life tapping, you should be, too!
---
I reckon they aren’t on top of the damage meters
---
or grind dungeons
---
You can buy Krol or Zeal if you want. What I listed is drops/quest items.
---
Most Nihilum raiders had low arena rating.
---
Get thrash asap and stick w/ vanguishers for OH till u get anything better until mirah's.
---
You really don't want to be level 48-59 when phase 2 hits.
---
Not everyone was doing it, but a good half easily.

**&lt;Cyrus&gt; | Alliance | Shazzrah**
---
[https://www.cyrus-gaming.com/](https://www.cyrus-gaming.com/)
---
**Introduction**  
---
Cyrus was founded over ten years ago back in early 2009, and has enjoyed success in MMO's such as Warhammer Online, Aion, Rift and World of Warcraft. Originally a PvP guild, over the years we learned to appreciate the joys and drama of raiding - and some of us have even learned to stop standing in the lava. It's not often you get a second go at things in life, so while we might not still fit into the same pair of skinny jeans we did 15 years ago, we are certainly going to take this opportunity by the horns and throw ourselves into some classic old-school guild life!
---
You can read more about our history here: [https://www.cyrus-gaming.com/history/](https://www.cyrus-gaming.com/history/)
---
We are currently running MC every week and recently have started running 2 x 25-man groups for Onyxia.
---
\*\*Raid Schedule (UK Times)\*\*  
---
Monday - PvP Night  
---
Wednesday - 7.20pm to 11pm  
---
Thursday – Dependant on progress  
---
Sunday – 7.20pm to 11pm
---
We will also organise Battlegrounds and World PvP nights.
---
**Member Expectations**  
---
Cyrus is a focused, progression-based guild for mature, skilled and team-orientated players. We have a long-established leadership committed to getting the most out of our members and ensuring everyone is working towards their own and the common goals of the guild.
---
Our raid schedule reflects that of a more grown up / responsible lifestyle, but we still expect members to be highly active, to participate in other guild activities and to ensure they are fully stocked and ready for when it's go time. You’ll need a thick skin, a good sense of humour, the discipline to know when to speak up, when to shut up and the dedication to constantly improve.
---
If this sounds like what you are looking for, don’t hesitate to apply on our website:
---
[https://www.cyrus-gaming.com/apply/](https://www.cyrus-gaming.com/apply/)
---
ywc, yeah just use a 20min timer but it's not crucial to hit every timer since you have 30minutes until you get logged out to character selection and another 30minutes until you're kicked, 20min is just to be sure
---
On my first toon, my dorf hunter I think i got snagged at 40-45. Was too far ahead for any kind of dungeon so that wasn't cool.
---
My warrior alt was a slog from 30-60. The whole thing was so bad it actually killed any interest in leveling my 3rd alt, a horde hunter/ally lock.
---
&gt;It sucks but at least you're getting the coolest looking mount in the game.
---
Wait, can paladins get the Swift Zulian Tiger??
---
ELI5?
---
Yeah taking the time to learn weakauras saves looking for add ons you want later
---
What you described is a great vibrant server full of people enriching other's game experience with their unpredictable player generated content.
---
&gt;But you are a prime example of someone I would not want to play with.
---
Things literally no one has ever said to me after a run LOL.  usually get like 4 kids adding me to their friend list
---
This is amazing
---
Yeah.
---
Nah corpse campers deserve corpse camping.  
---
You are providing a public service.
---
Just don't complain if he calls in reinforcements and they start corpse camping you. Violence begets violence
---
&gt; Yes, we absolutely give a crap about that. Saying that horde had it easier or was better at something just because 1-2 exceptional horde guilds managed to get to the top (in very few selective criterias) among the other \~90% alliance guilds is just an objectively wrong statement. 
---
Again you're arguing strawmen here, no one is claiming that horde had it easier or was better than alliance. But simply that Horde guilds got a lot of WFs.
---
&gt;If e.g. rhetorically 9 out of 10 of the top dps fury warriors on alliance were all human using swords/maces, but for some reason simply due to a little more effort or due to insane crit/proc luck during relevant parses, the #1 recorded dps was a gnome warrior, would you then also say "gnomes are better fury dps than humans, cuz the #1 is a gnome and people only care about that"? 
---
Again with the Strawmen. No one is claiming that the average Alliance guild wasn't better than the average horde guild (as measured by raid progress).
---
The claim was simply that horde has gotten a lot of WFs, which is objectively true.
---
based
---
So why do you come to ask if you already know better? This guy is right in my opinion btw
---
No, that’s cool. He sort of has it coming. I guess lt depends how long you do it.
---
There’s plenty of good players in Classic, they just avoid playing with you.
---
People who complain about corpse camping are usually silly, they probably did something to piss the guy off.  Honour system isn't going to make people corpse camp you any more or less than they do now - as there is significant diminishing returns on the honor given for killing someone you already killed recently.
---
We looked for 2 tanks for our MC pug last week
---
There’s plenty of good players in Classic, they just don’t want to play with you.
---
Get recipe Lionheart Helm on your server, be the only one, charge 100g for crafting it. Profit.
---
BLESSING OF WISDOM, NOT JUDGEMENT.  Mana tide requires not having the shaman in the melee group.  Blessing of wisdom is a free 33 mp/5 for the entire raid.   You don't need a paladin in each caster group to do that.  You need 8 shamans in your raid to do what 3-4 paladins can do for your raid.
---
Yes I KoS big guilds on my server, and various annoying enemy players.
---
Go PVE *if* you prefer a watered down neutered experience over the real thing.
---
Phase 2 is just the honor system. The honor system was out while I leveled in Vanilla, it’s part of the game and won’t drastically affect your leveling experience, although running dungeons will be much more viable since you can’t get pvp killed in dungeons. I play on a PVP server and occasionally while leveling a group of alliance come through and kill me or I have to 1v1 some random douchelord but earning points for killing players won’t change that much... either way you’re gonna get killed sometimes in pvp, although if you quest in low traffic zones you’ll see very little pvp
---
Legit haven't seen them drop in 20 runs. To win them out of 3 ppl w/ a roll of 3..
---
You have a little over one week to do 15 levels, which take about as much playtime as everything you've done so far.
---
I think the raw XP midpoint is 45 but the /played midpoint is a bit lower (since you get more XP for mobs and quests at higher levels anyway) so you're moderately past halfway.
---
You also should not be running out of quests at 45.
---
You are halfway there. What do you think?
---
**11/11 &lt;Senile Chieftains&gt;** | EU Pvp Shazzrah Server, Horde | Casual but serious raiding guild.     
---
**Introduction**  "Senile Chieftains" is made for people who would like to see all the classic raid content (again), but are not able or willing to spend 8 nights a week playing. Of our 4 raids that we will run every week, we only expect you to attend 1 (read our guild-info for some extra rules concerning availability). There are options available for people who would like to raid multiple days.   
---
We are mostly ex raiders who have grown to old to raid to many evenings a week. Back in vanilla we cleared aq40 until the 'twin emperors', but because of the "tbc" release the guild disbanded.     
---
**Expectations from members**   
---
We are looking for experienced and skilled players to realize our goal of clearing all classics raid content. New players are also welcome, but keep in mind that most of our players are now 30 years and older so we will have a more mature guild environment.      
---
**Raid information**    
---
Raiding days are Mon-Thur 20:00 - 23:00 (server time). Once available, we will run organized raids on off days for lower tier content for alts and those who want to complete their tier/bis sets. Loot will be distributed by a loot council aided by a hidden dkp system.    
---
Check [https://www.senilechieftains.com/](https://www.senilechieftains.com/) for more information!
---
I fully believe that kids like you. It´s always people with the same mindset that find together and I´m happy. Cause if you do the children groups I can go with the adults :) so thx
---
Getting Hanked is not a good day.
---
Yeah and adsl is not a 400 ping... adsl is like 20-100 unless you're on the other side of the world.
---
400 ping is worse than average pings you'd get on a dial-up ffs.
---
I used to play a lot of quake 2 on dialup back in the 90s, my ping was usually 120-180.
---
&gt;many smooth and FAST runs
---
I think this right here is where some of the problem OP is talking about is coming from. With a group of good players, as you write, you can go smooth and fast - but when you're in a pug with someone who might have been carried by 4 good players in another run starts thinking that he's awesome and knows how to do this dungeon things can get ugly. People who might have had a very smooth run due to having the luck of being in a good group where things click can grossly overestimate their own ability and just "speed along" being careless and underestimate the difficulty of certain pulls - and if they don't have anyone covering for what they should be doing things can go badly. Some abilities you really want to interrupt, you'll want a team that finishes off runners, minds the pat that's around the corner, etc. 
---
This is just from a healer's perspective, comparing my (admittedly anecdotal) runs through different dungeons between 50-60 and on - lately I find myself leaning more and more towards full or half+ guild runs just because it's more fun and relaxing.
---
It's very easy for a DPS at this stage to overtake you in threat, if a melee DPS goes all out and goes above you, on some bosses they are going to be 1 shot in that 400ms window you have before you can even do anything about it.
---
Your attitude to this seems odd to me, like why fight with your teammates. Boss is gonna be killed within 90s even if you take it easy... is it really worth downing it in 75s but having a few people dead?
---
Yes. It is. Never said it wouldn't.
---
3v3 meta would be a lot of Pom pyro mages.
---
In the jed case, are you sure it just wasn't Briarwood Reed that dropped and you already had it? Unique items will only be rolled for people that already have it if everyone has that item.
---
Im over 30 LOL just because someones good at the game doesn't mean they're a child.  wow isn't a very hard game it's super easy to keep up theres a gcd limiting you from having to do anything too fast.
---
Citation needed because nost did it on a non existent budget compared to blizzard's.
---
Leveling arms was aids compared to fury, especially post 40. If pvp is an issue then yea, arms. Otherwise fury, every time
---
.save
---
But it looks like shit. xD
---
You really want at least one Warlock for Curse of Elements and one Druid for MoW and Faerie fire.
---
It is so odd reading this sub. My experience was nothing like this and 99% of the dungeon runs were awesome.
---
I have a hard time believing that someone would be that insistent on playing the same character after getting ganked that many times. He could have leveled an alt to somewhere between 10-15 in that time.
---
I don´t expect you to understand what I say, neither that you read what I try to tell you. It doesn´t matter how old you are physically. Its a given fact that people with the same mindset find together more easily and you wrote yourself " usually get like 4 kids adding me to their friend list" .. but ofc, you have to mention that you are good at the game. Should I recognize your large epen so that you feel better?
---
I have two stancedancer the warrior and neryu the mage.. I will find them one day
---
In vanilla spell batching was 200 ms now it’s 400+, don’t down play what he’s saying because he’s correct.
---
Warlocks can do pretty comparable damage on rag, and druids can decurse.  Ice block pulling does make garr considerably easier that is true, but it can definitely be done without the mage with a bit more effort.
---
I've literally never seen that mace before, I've been using Maul + Counterweight over Warden lately, but that's a great threat weapon and it even has a bit of armor. 
---
Back to grinding BRD I guess
---
Hey,
---
From what I understand, 'Pyrewood Village' was sort of an unofficial Spanish server, but it could be that most have moved away to a dedicated Spanish server now.
---
Mirage Raceway and Pyrewood Village were the two original PVE servers so they'll both have a decent population. I believe they're both slightly alliance favoured but that shouldn't matter too much on a PVE server.
---
Another option would be Hydraxian Waterlords, slightly smaller pop, but still a good amount of PVE happening (again, more so alliance side) and RP servers always add to the immersion for me.
---
Most guilds I've seen will banish as many ads as they have warlocks for and then nuke garr before clearing the unbanished ads then letting banishes fall off to nuke the next wave of ads. I haven't seen any raids split up to clear other ads while garr ads are still up unless they were trying to speed clear
---
You can also just make an alt, send them to him and then send them back :)
---
If they red, they dead.
---
I am on full hp as a mage with fireward up, standing in the right spot and die to living bomb. What happened?
---
I got stuck in early 50's as well, too high to get any noteworthy exp from ZF and too low for anyone to take me through BRD, once I got 55 I started picking up the pace again.
---
That's because when I play with supposedly decent players they realise they're not as decent as they think. It's like how everybody thinks their gangsta until the real OGs pull up.
---
I agree with you, but your other replies also make you look like an idiot.
---
As buzz lightyear once said "You are a sad, strange little man, and you have my pity. Farewell..."
---
Or that, but this way you don't even have to bother logging on and off multiple times. You can just keep on questing.
---
He did mentioned he played in PvP realms in private servers and it was miserable, that's why he rolled on a pve server
---
Walking slowly instead of running. There's a hotkey to toggle between walking/running. Most players never walk slowly (it's slow after all), so it makes you look like an NPC or a roleplayer.
---
I remember thinking "200 ms is a good ping" up until PvP S3 in BC. 
---
I was used to do arena at 250 - 350 ms.
---
Loc: Vienna, Austria
---
Most of the Argent Dawn NPC's will do this
---
No, it wasn't
---
You're thinking of civilian NPCs which count as dishonourable kills. Any player who is grey to you gives no honor but there is no penalty for killing them. Farming low level players to kickstart wPVP by making them log their main is sometimes used as an excuse by gankers for purging Redridge/Stonetalon etc.
---
Nope, you’re doing your low level faction comrades a service. The best way to deter a corpse camper is to corpse camp them yourself.
---
Thanks! Is that a boss that gets downed in jed/rend runs ? If so it might be worth having a look at. The Cadverous Armour dream is dead for me now ha.
---
Ah very cool! Never played on a RP server.
---
Mate if you're over 30 and acting like a child on forums about issues that do exist, that's just sad, my nephews have better mannerisms than you and they're 9...
---
Pretty much, and they can be used in order to make sure your fish can't get away. At 300/300, you'll still have to use a +100 lure and fishing gear giving +30 (maybe more? can't recall) to fish some areas without fish getting away. If you are Horde, there is a Hinterlands quest rewarding you with a +25 fishing pole - don't make the mistake of selling or sharding this one.
---
everyone know kung-fu in yojamba !
---
care bear blizzard doesnt allow infernal 'griefing'
---
Chess isn't a role playing game, not sure how you would even compare that.
---
Only vs 2+ mobs :)
---
Everybody contributed resources to guild bank for dkp, then we used the consumables made from them.
---
Type 123 if u need lul
---
Not aware of this, but just based on your usual rotations and utility spells used routinely you should get a feel for what your most common and key abilities are.
---
Is the situation for tanks really that bad? It takes like half an hour sometimes but finding a tank happens eventually in peak times.
---
People are exaggerating a bit how much you'll be killed. Unless you're hanging out in Tanaris, or running to BRD or questing in EPL you'll just be ganked slightly more now.
---
Most people pvp in EPL, BRM and Felwood...but Felwood is pretty spread out lots of places to hide.
---
Pretty sure shaman &gt; all at level 6
---
&gt;3 hours per day
---
Anyone playing less than 20 hours a week has no right to be ahead of the curve.  Enjoy the game at your own pace, but don't whinge because your 10 hours / week isn't keeping up with the people who have more time to play.
---
Like I said elsewhere, phase 3 adds one raid, and doesn't make any previous raids obsolete.  Bringing out phase 3 after 4-5 months allows anyone who cares about being BiS to get their gear.
---
A lot of people want to be ahead of the curve, but classic is not a game where many people will achieve that.  If that's not ok with you, play another game.
---
He played on pserver with pvp rules
---
or like me, people are lazy \^\^
---
I'd still say MC would go much more smoothly with mages over warlocks, rogues, druids and hunters. As long as you have warriors to tank and melee dps, and priests and shamans/paladins to heal you're fine in mc. You don't need banish or even tranq shot but dps will make things much smoother
---
This is a sarcastic post right?
---
Just hit lvl 50 on my priest. Am I ok to heal dungeons in shadow spec or will I have a tougher time of it? And at what point should I consider respecting to Holy/disc?
---
wowhead has statistics on #of 60s per realm.
---
You have Coleridge covered and I will keep redridge mtns bulldozed as well. Glory to the Horde!
---
I have seen them 4 times in over 200 runs (trying to get my shoulders and getting a friend of mine his felstriker).
---
Why is flying so bad? As you acknowledge, TBC and WotLK zones were designed with flying in mind. What exactly would a redesign "fix"? Hell, what do you imagine Icecrown would look like without flying? The verticality of WotLK zones in particular makes them stand out.
---
I completely agree on the dungeon finder aspect, though.
---
Huh? I saw a guy selling it for 350ish g for a few days and he wasn't getting a sale (gehennas eu horde)
---
What does playing a role have to do with the game being well-researched?
---
as a night-elf leveling into discipline, i disagree, starshard is a complete MVP in non-shadow leveling.
---
Yeah it is and it takes some of the wonder and flavor out, but of course that was going to happen in such an old game.
---
Imagine calling someone a pussy based on their video game choice lol. You're the nerd in school who deserves to get stuffed into lockers
---
Ha ha ha
---
Water elementals in EPL. If you farm them in the morning you can easily get 3 essences of water/hour.
---
I thought winning a roll with a 59 was a low roll 😂
---
Any dogs in the groups thats chasing u when vanish ? If so they might be the issue
---
The argent dawn is a neutral faction, but he's still a human.   I don't really see an issue with this.
---
Leveling with my RL friend (his first time playing wow). He’s going to play an undead mage...what’s the best class to complement him with? I have a lvl 38 mage and 30 warlock so preferably something new. He doesn’t want to do any dungeons and we’ll only be playing together so don’t think I’ll have to do anything solo.
---
I’m thinking priest (go tailoring and make us gear), rogue, or warrior. Only thing with warrior is if we’re not doing any dungeons feels like I might as well go rogue right?
---
That depends on the class.  Rogues will focus elites for combo points, but most casters will aoe as much was possible.  Warlocks are great for this with dot spreading.
---
It will be for the first couple of patches. Legion got it in 7.2 IIRC, dont remember when it was for BfA but my guess would be 8.2 or 8.1.5.
---
You rarely get kicked/bashed by monsters in leveling. What make starshad gold is that its mana cost is low and damages are very high.
---
power word shield, then Holy fire+shadow word pain then spam starshard (Usually 1 or 2) is surprisingly very fast to kill monsters.
---
Our elderly are probably better at it because we’ve kind of forced them to learn it in Denmark. It’s excruciating to communicate with the public sector if you’re not digital, and unlike young people the elderly actually cared enough to learn.
---
People did that week two, not sure why it's not more widespread.
---
It is for me. As a Warlock I could do BRD, LBRS, or Strat to get BiS items right now. I logon, jump in any of the above groups (which are always going) and sit around fishing for up to an hour. At that point I either have a tank or log off.
---
I'm honestly giving up on some of my items. I feel like I've been 60 for ages now and if I try to spend a whole weekend in LBRS I'll run it twice and see my pants drop 0 times.
---
i said 25gold because i mentioned the travelers backpack
---
I actually think your suggestion is fairly likely. They rushed out Dire Maul for no apparent reason and come next week they're going to have *a lot* of primarily Alliance players up in arms or straight up just deciding not to play until P3.
---
I think the whole "every FP, every quest zone, every zone entrance, camped 24/7" is overblown. Ganking will become more common but people levelling up want to level up, and a lot of 60s will just end up fighting each other.
---
But the first week or two will be rough, because it'll be new and people will over-indulge. On the many realms where the A-H ratio is badly skewed towards H, leaving non-contested territory will be a death sentence in those weeks.
---
I reckon they'll bring at least WSG out early.
---
It does work, because there's more to enjoying a game of chess than discovery.
---
The only reason I play chess is because I enjoy the company of my opponent.
---
The only reason I play Classic is because I enjoy the company of my friends.
---
If you want new and discovery and the unknown, play a different game.
---
Classic IS the chess of RPGs. Everything's already been done, everything is already known, nothing about the game is ever going to change, and it's clearly stood the test of time for those that enjoy it.
---
I actually leveled up Mining to 300 to get my mount. Arcanite Bars were like 100g when the patch hit and even a few days later they still were going for 75g.
---
i can assure you that in vanilla there were  a lot of pvp when honor came out
---
Not PvP but Pyrewood is super active on the Alliance side. Also see a lot of horse in contested zones
---
Druid ? You bring everything he doesn't (tanking, healing, stealth) as well as some CC. For leveling you can't go wrong with druids.
---
Do you want to know the biggest problems of retail and what makes it different from classic?
---
Its not the level or the talent trees. Its the social factor. Everything being cross play ruins the server community.
---
LFR/G and flying ruins the world feeling. Itemization and different difficulties ruin the RPG feel
---
Classic is an mmorpg while retail is an arcade game
---
Retail should stop catering to people who don't have time or don't want to play an mmorpg, maybe then people would consider it again.
---
The issue is dungeons are a bit of a time gamble for me. It takes me long enough to find/start a dungeon party (even as a healer), and then that’s assuming it’s a smooth run. Sometimes they’re not and I end up wasting an evening enduring a bad group run after spending a considerable time getting a group going. 
---
As for skipping quests, I see the rationale there but it just feels wrong that I’m compromising my classic levelling experience by skipping iconic levelling zones like STV and Tanaris because of factors outside my control. Not to mention it drives my completion OCD nuts lol.
---
Stonespine is pretty good tbh
---
&gt;  I can do DE with a lvl 5 Alt
---
There are tonnes of shitty BoP quest rewards you will either DE or vendor, and you can't send them to an alt.
---
They stopped add ons having the ability to read /who ages ago to not show actual populations.
---
Where are you looking at your damage numbers?  Looking at warcraft logs right now and in the top 100 parses around 80 of them are warrior 10 rogue 5ish are warlock and the first mage is at 98.    I imagine mages parse higher on average, but that probably involves guilds that don't one phase rag and the mages get to aoe the fire adds better than anyone else.
---
Skullflame
---
Yes. Im a french canadian and back in vanilla i was on EU servers and really there is no big deal with de distance. The only thing that suck is the 6h delay
---
&gt;half your time spent inside a fight would just be rebuffing people.
---
ALL of their time. Literally 100%.
---
Talk to blizzard customer support, they'll be able to help you out
---
No one compliments my Succubus...sadface
---
I used to raid in a HC guild with a single hunter because everything died so fast, no need to kite anything.
---
Stonespine
---
I was thinking domo/rag mostly with my timings.
---
When you say you have fights down to 30s you mean you have Shazz/Luci/Gehannes down to 30s? I mean yeah fair enough but also none of those are going to one shot you.
---
You can still do whatever you want whenever you want on a pvp server... just gitgud broh
---
Maybe you have better luck as alliance. I’m on the horde side (death to you alliance scum btw) and it’s definitely an issue. Not exactly sure what the ratio divide looks like on skullflame but I assume as with other PvP realms the horde faction is the dominant one. Besides I’m only seeing an issue with there being too much competition from my own faction, I very rarely have to compete with alliance scum for the same mobs.
---
Maybe not cater to those players? Look at this reddit, it literally is a giant validating tool for those people who likes to play as slow as possible. Their reasoning "gotta do it the old slow fashion way cause \*other\* people are bad and if you don't agree to slow down for them, then you are actually the real bad ones".
---
Or back then we were all young and had all the time in the world. Nowadays not so much with jobs and other commitments.

Like a week ago i was in a group to kill nathanos in the plaguelands and apparently he's a quest giver for the whorde. Some filthy undead was finishing quests and he dinged to 60...what better way to welcome him to his 60s then to gank him?
---
It will cost you probably 100+g because you create stuff which is mostly worthless. It cost me less than 50g for tailoring because I could disenchant stuff and get most of my money back.
---
Yeah, more like 3x more powerful.
---
Yea and we actually messed up kinda. Frostmane trolls are green, not blue, with dark blue hair and purple face paint. They are also smaller than Horde trolls
---
we can try to compete for some mobs tonight in searing gorge? just for pvp fun lol
---
Ah yeah I want to be undead, forgot to mention that part (and I know I can run all the way from Mulgore but rather just start UD)
---
On a private server I played on the alliance resorted to levelling by farming trolls in the village between felwood and darkshore.  
---
Dungeon xp is higher in classic so I assume that will be the way for most.
---
And druids have it easier than warriors.
---
Yeah, I got most of my preraid BiS and am now raiding every week. In the meantime I'm leveling fishing and cooking and collecting herbs for my alchemy since last week I got the Major Mana Potion recipe. And then I'm playing dungeons to get some gear sets for my offspecs, since I play a druid. I literally can't wait to get home and play a dungeon and see if my piece will finally drop.
---
And next week is PvP which means I'm gonna have to rank up to get pvp gear. It's gonna be lots of fun. Since launch day I wasn't bored for 1 second. I'm even leveling an alt mage now just for fun and to farm gold.
---
If you're bored, maybe this game isn't for you anymore.
---
people like to talk big shit about potion keybinds until they accidentally drink a major mana for no reason
---
can you mind control someone and .... gather herbs/veins ? now that would be freaky ...   
---
even better if you can get someone to trade them or something similar, i doubt it but worth a try even if it fails
---
That sounds really bad indeed. During peak hours I'm most of the time finding groups within a few minutes (I'm healer, though) and think I haven't spent that much time finding a group since BRD times, when peoples' levels were still spread all over due to different leveling speeds. I don't know, maybe I'm lucky or it's due to a decent number of tanks in guild, but haven't had that bad of an experience. I also don't see tanks prostituting themselves in trade chat, the closest I've seen is a troll warrior who is "LFM Strat Living smooth run, orbs are reserved". Judging by the frequency at which he spams his macro there's plenty of tanks who don't operate on this basis, or who perhaps only reserve one orb (which I would deem acceptable if he's well-geared and prot). 
---
I see many non-mage damage dealers who blame their class choice and seem to be stuck with the same complaint they've harbored since ZF that "all groups just want mages for AoE DPSzz", which I don't believe in for a bit and I don't think you do either (at least you don't complain about it). If I can have another melee except for the tank I have all the more reason to drop Windfury, I might have another team member with access to a low-CD interrupt and some pretty awesome on-demand CC and very high single target damage - I'll sure as hell try to get them into my group. Shame you're not on Bloodfang, I still need some stuff from Scholo and would be happy to run it with you.
---
Yeah, difficulty tuning in Wrath was way too forgiving, and something that should be adjusted if a WoTLK2 was ever going to be a thing.
---
That said Obsidian Sanctum was a joke and should've never existed in the first place, even as filler content it made no sense how easy it was to clear and how little thought was put into it.
---
shamans should always drop a poison cure totem against rogues as blind is a poison
---
I like that, that is new knowledge to me, and something I will be keeping in mind for my future raids. Thank you.
---
So a very common theme will be you go into a zone (lets say 42-45 level zone) for a few quests, then go to another zone (also around 40-45ish) for a few quests, then back to the first for another half or whole level, then back to the 2nd again to finish them off. Then you progress to another zone or two.
---
Right. Mana tide does the same as blessing of wisdom. Your point is still not working. Paladins don't have innervate for everyone in their group.
---
You don't need a shaman in each group either; one in healer groups, one in melee damage groups. That never adds up to 8.
---
Shamans' totems such as WF or Mana Tide have **HUGE** impact that paladins can only dream of. It's only natural that it doesn't affect the whole raid.
---
i really should have. went for +7 stam on the boots cos I figured I wanted to be as beefy as possible. but speed would have been better
---
Well here's the good news, even if bwl were to drop tomorrow you and the 99% of your guild that doesn't want more content can just keep running mc/Randy dungeons just like you can now. Just because there is other shit to do doesn't mean you have to stop doing what you want, I was in a shit guild  in tbc and we were still doing karazhan when other guilds had ssc/the eye on farm.
---
I'm 46 and swiftly running out of quests that are my level or just below. I structure with quests higher than my level as I'm a warrior. Any advice?
---
Funny enough I was planning to head to searing gorge tonight haha. If you see an undead priest called Bigzibbie...erm don’t kill me pls.
---
Skullflame is a trash server with a massive Horde to ally ratio
---
Aren't hunters required to dispel enrages?
---
Lucky you. We're literally disenchanting loot quite often because 1) we get druid loot all the time and 2) all the druids have most of it already.
---
you sure? I've never seen a 19 twink with those, I would assume they would have them if they could wear them
---
It mostly just helps to play the game for hours a day.
---
I think the point he is making is the fact that reddit community is catering to the lowest denominator. You can have great DPS, great heals, great tankign but shitty synergy and it would cause the group to wipe. However the default answer seem to always be "dur hur hur, lets pull one mob at a time and make sure healer is above 90% mana, and the mage better not AoE EVER otherwise its gonna be a bad day".
---
Culture is a big, unwieldy thing.
---
Damn
---
I use Vuhdo for my 'on clicks' (healing, cleansing, short-duration buffs \[ie Blessing of Freedom\]). Then I use Grid2 to take the place of the Blizzard Raid Frame, so that I can still click on players to select them or to right click on them for more options.
---
As for automation. That's not possible, and if by some chance it exists...it's against the ToS/EULA; it's considered botting. Now there may be an addon that functions like PallyPower, and lists all the classes for you to buff ((Reference:  [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/pally-power/screenshots](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/pally-power/screenshots) )) - This is probably the addon you saw:  [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/buffomat](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/buffomat) . It shouldn't be against the ToS because all it does is scan and then tell *you* to click the button. But the interface looks kind of jank. :\\
---
&gt; I would love to see TBC and WotLK but keeping it more close to Classic.  Never introduce flying, never introduce dungeon finder. And then make  tweaks accordingly, like solve problem with zones that have been  designed for flying mounts. 
---
This is the better direction for the players to be suggesting. flying ruined an already failing gameplay style; world pvp through gathering resource competition. in classic people mount from node to node, we will absolutely do the same with flying mounts. this kills all reason to fight over gathering nodes because no one can stop another player after they successfully get on their bird.  
---
&gt; Of course it would be great to still keep Classic content relevant.  Making just new dedicated servers might tear player base too much if  there is three different versions of the game. 
---
Another great point. servers dedicated to specific expansions will produce many unwanted problems. First is what happens if the popular suggestion is chosen where a series of servers are created for the sole purpose of classic characters being copied to. those servers will have empty and dead economies where vanilla resources are higher in value than what's collectable in outland and there won't be enough supply. because the only characters in azeroth will be paladins and shaman. it doesn't matter if people like this idea or not because the actual effects of this cause, which have happened already on many private servers, are net negative.  
---
as you've said this will also pull players away from classic meaning that low population servers will be that much more fragile. we've only seen blizzard trying to intervene for high population servers and should assume they're going to ignore the dying/dead servers like they have in the past 15 years.  
---
&gt; Classic+ idea is my favourite but it can be risky. If content they  produce does not feel like Classic, players might move back to private  servers. Blizzard is company and from business point of view I am more  sure that if they give us more content, it will be TBC and not Classic+  as it's just more risk free way. 
---
kern, while a shakey source of information and personality, has suggested that the team repurpose the content of expansions for classic wow as the assets have already been created. it's worth adding to that classic+ doesn't need to repeat all of the same mistakes as the expansions when bringing the content of those expansions to the classic playerbase.  
---
level 60 can still be the cap while having room for the new talent trees and spells, professions, reputations battlegrounds and arenas. rpg players as a demographic will do whatever is required for them to see their character grow in power. if that were to mean doing quests in a zone to bring their reputation up with a faction to then unlock a dungeon and repeating that series until their unlocking the next raid instance, they'll do it. a level cap of 70 shouldn't be required to kill magtheridon or gruul. level 70 is just a number that, like quantity of health, armor, dodge, and parry, can be adjusted.  
---
ideally burning crusade content will be restructured to bring "new" activities to classic players without creating a tumor of content that characters are funneled into. classic+ should maintain reasons for people to farm felcloth, arcane crystals, black lotus, golden pearls, and elemental essences from zones like winterspring, plaguelands, azshara, etc.
---
UBRS run last night, "LF1M Tank UBRS", so I whisper my bear wants to join. I'll let you guess how many warriors were in this "tank starved" run. The mages caused me to worry (as I have learned to in way too many dungeons), but they were excellent overall, no problems there.
---
The "I have to peek round the corner with the tank and charge ASAP 'cus I need rage" warrior, who promptly gets charged by a veteran and knocked into the whelps below... yeah, it happened more than once.
---
The "It's a core part of my rotation!" hunter, who multishots at the same time as the warrior tries a LOS pull, sends their pet in to aggro another pack and starts complaining about no heals when 5 mobs are on him.
---
(and the hunter barely put out more dps than I did tanking)
---
These 2 made the whole experience hell, I'm glad they died as often as they did, but I am under no illusions that the excessive repair bills they faced will in any way mitigate their awful play, attitude and behaviours.
---
These sorts of runs are the exception, but the risk of a 70 minute run turning into a 3 hour slog is enough to make me seriously think twice about tanking outside of guild runs.
---
Me neither
---
Also suggesting that every single DPS in the raid is somehow threat capped.
---
Rogue, fury war, and I (feral druid) lost these to an enhance shaman that was lvl 58 in greens :(.
---
You shouldn’t need that as a rogue.
---
Yes you can.  
---
The chance for glancing blow is based on your weapon skill vs the target defence skill. And a mob
---
***Trouble [EU-Horde-Razorgore]***  is a community-driven, progression-focused, English-speaking raiding guild. We’ve been playing online games together for upwards of 15 years, and we’ve picked up a whole bunch of great players and good friends along the way. We have a wide array of players from all across Europe, and beyond, with varying different levels of experience.
---
We have players who have reached high heights in both PvE and PvP across various expansions, but also others that have never even played vanilla WoW before. With this in mind, we are creating an inclusive guild where everyone is welcome, as long as they’re enthusiastic and willing to play with us to the best of their ability.
---
***Raiding***
---
We will be raiding two nights a week (all times are in  **Server Time (CET)** ):
---
**Tuesday 8:00-11:30 PM**
---
**Sunday 8:00-11:30 PM**
---
Come Phase 3 (BWL), an additional raid night will be added to revisit older raid tiers.
---
All participants are expected to bring their own consumables. You don’t have to be doing top tier DPS/HPS, but you do need to respect the rest of the guild enough to bring what you need to be functional in a raid.
---
***Loot System***
---
Our loot system is a very simple, closed bid DKP system with partial decay to help deter hoarding. Name a more iconic duo than loot council and drama.
---
When the third raid day is introduced in Phase 3 (BWL), it is worth noting that it will NOT use the DKP system, and all items will be rolled (main-spec priority, as usual) between raiders who want them. The reason for this is that a lot of people in the guild can only raid two days a week, tops, and they should not feel like they have to come to this raid in order to keep up on DKP for the main tier raids.
---
***Classes***
---
Like any other guild, we would prefer the dominant classes with meta specs. However, we do believe that the player comes above the class and spec in a lot of circumstances. If you’re dedicated, positive and willing to listen, those things go an exceptionally long way.
---
With that in mind, we are willing to give most people a shot, with the caveat that those classes and specs with a generally weak performance may find it harder to earn a permanent raid spot. If you are very confident in your ability to play an off-meta spec that isn’t listed below to an acceptable level, feel free to contact us:
---
**Druid**  -  **CLOSED**
---
**Hunter**  -  **CLOSED**
---
**Mage**  -  **CLOSED**
---
**Priest**  -  **CLOSED**
---
**Rogue**  -  **CLOSED**
---
**Shaman**  -  **CLOSED**
---
**Warlock**  -  **CLOSED**
---
**Warrior**  -  **Fury (DPS or Tank), Protection**
---
**Classes that are closed are still welcome to join, but you probably won’t be able to raid with us unless/until we have a huge turnover of people.**
---
***Contact***
---
We’d love to answer any questions you may have. The best way to contact us is by joining our Discord:
---
https://discord.gg/Wj2fMHP
---
You can also talk to an officer directly on Discord by adding an officer to your friends list:

Thanks for your time!
---
Yesterday we literally waited a hour to find a tank for strat. Sometimes I hate classic because you have to wait so long
---
Why is that? i am a horde on skullflame too and popularity seems great to me. I am level 42 atm and in the contested zones there seem to be an even number of horde/alliance.  No experience at 60 though.
---
Can you tell me the link you found to a working grid2? I looked on curseforge, wowinterface, willitclassic and the link they all have doesn’t work with my classic. I even tried to make a new wtf/interface folder with just grid and it still doesn’t work.
---
Much appreciated
---
Level 56 and burned out right now.
---
Next level I can wear robe of the void and bunch of other BiS gear, maybe it gets better.
---
You dont get aimed shot until lvl 51 if you are BM so dont sweat it. You will change the bow before that happens. When you get aimed shot it gets more important to get a slow weapon for huge crits and more optimal timing for clipping.
---
It will drain some more ammo, but if you have a main with gold thats not a issue right?
---
If you’re also going to do PvP then staff is better. And even if you aren’t, for the average player sta and int are going to be worth a fair bit more than the BIS lists rate them.
---
You should be fine, Canada is relatively close so it shouldn't trigger a false positive.
---
You could send a mail to support that you will be playing from a different country for 6 months just in case. Tell them to add a remark to your account in their system or something.
---
On golemagg, everyone from Represent (a Spanish horde guild who create groups just to kill lowbies or ruin farm spots etc, they also Rob devilsaur from their own faction, fantastic bunch of people).
---
Anyone who kills a low alt with a much higher level, or anyone griefing flightpaths all earn a spot on the kill on sight list.
---
you get to 200 without mithril, mithril and thorium are the expensive part
---
on lucifron-ger I spend 55g to level engi 1-200 for me and my friend
---
I’m from the states, currently traveling in multiple countries. 
---
I did got locked out of my account but easily unlocked after putting on a mobile Authenticator. 
---
Currently playing without issues.
---
[see this video ](https://youtu.be/yeaMuGCQhA8)
---
I needed on zf axe Even though i alredy had it and none other needed it so free gold. Turns out the other guy was in a run earlier with me where i got it. So basically i got owned and «blacklisted» blalala. Truth is nobody really cares in lower level dungeon unless you are a complete shitter and new to the game
---
I remember this. Our priests had a "rotation" routine, me being a druid was brought into BWL with sole purpose to inervate the first priest to OOM. Maybe drop a few HOTs here and there while making sure I have enough for Brez, that's it!
---
40 shaman would be mesmerizing
---
I like bis lists because they give me the sense of completion and achievement. When I get an item I am done with it and can focus something else. Where retail there is always a chance for an item to roll with higher stats and I feel burnt out in the end knowing that it is an endless grind.
---
Not sure if you can do Magmadar without tranq shot m8
---
You do get ganked a lot in leveling, though.
---
This is also a very legitimate concern.
---
Yeah even during peak hours my LFG macro seems to fall on deaf ears. I do blame myself though, I leveled to 52 as a warlock, decided I didnt really like it and rerolled. I guess as I was re-levelling the majority of players hit 60 and ran all the necessary dungeons to oblivion. At least that's how I'm seeing it. 
---
Yeah it's funny you touched on the Strat orb tanks as they are the only tanks that seem to be available, which is a problem in itself as a lot of people dont think the tanks deserve anything. (Even if they are fully geared and have no business being there)
---
Haha yeah I'm not too bothered about the whole mage aoe farming groups because theres nothing stopping me from making my own "traditional" group.
---
Well, no, it's located in the badlands
---
The dps increase of choosing one over the other is negligible. It might differ 1-2 dps depending on what other gear you have. I would personally go for MH+OH.
---
Aren’t arrows levwl locked?
---
He is saying that [hunters got aspect of the wild](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20190/aspect-of-the-wild) which is equivalent to [nature resistance totem](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=10601/nature-resistance-totem#see-also-ability). So you use that instead of the totem
---
On Bloodfang? That's crazy, what time was that? My only guess is \~19-22 or something, when many guilds choose to raid. Otherwise I just don't know..
---
If you know your banish target before hand there's no difference. Except you only require 3-5 warlocks to know what they are supposed to do and it's easier to call them out if the mess up rather than having everyone remember to stay or go and if you ever have to pug or bring in a new raider or anything it becomes more confusing
---
No it actually was 16:00~ pm
---
Magmadar is a joke in classic. In mc you dont need hunter
---
Load
---
In Mythic+ communication is key. But in Classic you don’t need to plan much. If you have Mages then you can just mass pull and aoe everything down.
---
You legit ignored the fact that Mana spring totem exists. Mana spring totem has the same twin than Wisdom blessing.
---
And even with that, Mana tide will get your more mana back for most encounters. :D Congratulations, you did the math proving how insane the mana regen from Mana tide is.
---
I needed mithril for 195-200
---
I saw you a couple weeks ago on my dwarf paladin, you waved and helped me kill a few boars. I knew right away you were doing some fun RP stuff and it made me smile
---
He stated he asked the Warlock to go ahead and try his luck with a roll to see if he would have been able to roll higher. He then states that the Priest does it as well and rolls a 99 claiming he deserves the neck. He was being playful and just telling the guy to try rolling to see if it would have rolled higher than him not that it would have mattered.
---
There, hope that explains it.
---
I don’t agree with that sorry. Banish resists and offtanking etc makes this too inconsistent compared to bursting him down and clearing ads then
---
But if i see a mail icon, i need to get rid of it
---
Were not even using tranq anymore. Our tanks barely notice the frenzy
---
Cause I'm burned, I played too much.
---
Gandling is doing fine, it even has ques sometimes still (but at least not constantly). Ally-Horde ratio is around 40-60 ish.
---
This is why I have a 56, 45, and a 29. I am in no rush to get to 60 because Phase 3 is so far away still.
---
In classic you definitely can
---
I'm 204 and did not use mithril or some guide
---
You can always have it up since the buff last 10 mins. If it gets dispelled its not hard to precast it before a fear.
---
Yea I got mine from here:

---
but do NOT click the Download button - scroll down on the page and look in the bottom right corner under "Recent Files" - choose the "r939-classic" file, this is the one you want. I did the mistake of just clicking "Download" and it gave me a version not working whatsoever. Grabbing the one from under Recent Files should do the trick. 
---
Hope that helps!
---
It does work nicely since the tank mostly controls the pace and is the first to go in. If the tank leads, less time needs to be spent typing directions.
---
That said, it is by no means a necessity. On my first run through a dungeon, I'm definitely gonna let someone more experienced run the group.
---
Levitate is only available for the caster in Classic.
---
Didn't know you start counting at 3
---
What did you make to level 195-204?
---
It's not hard to dispell it again.
---
Off with ye!
---
Fair enough. I haven't tried healing raids with the HOTW spec, but could heal Onyxia in a PuG with a 20 Holy / 31 Prot paladin spec and no raid gear. (7 pieces of Pre-Raid BiS, and the rest of the gear is decent pieces)
---
I Assumed Druids could do something similar with decent pre-raid gear.
---
They sit in ur mailbox for 30 days..I rather send them from a twink. Putting them into the ah takes much more time
---
Now priests flash heal non-stop from the start of the fight and still have mana when the boss is downed, a whole 90 seconds later.
---
Running away is what this persons guild told them to do. Not to play on a PvP server because PvE will be unplayable.
---
My solution was to remove ones self from that, and find a group that that encourages you to thrive.
---
skullflame
---
 [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Ammunition](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Ammunition)
---
not really a speedrun guild hahaha we had some pickups for the raid, you are right. Anyways, I was damn happy when he died lol, we have been doing 9/10 2 weeks.
---
I have never once had to "limit" my dps due to threat, once tanks get them they kinda just stay on them. Don't think this has ever been an issue, you just give the tank 2 seconds on the boss then you're good to go in.
---
Guilds clear MC with people under 60 in green gear. Its the perfect raid for guilds like this
---
It's not that we can't but it's def not optimal.
---
a gnomish cloaking device and some target dummys
---
Oh look, it's another one of these let the tank pull/wait for healer mana posts. How original.
---
It takes one click to list them on the AH
---
Ohhh, so the feather still give rep at 60? I was afraif that I'd might started to farm at the wrong spot!
---
So an alt is not as good of an idea as your AH method.
---
yep,
---
Can confirm, do you know if they removed layers?
---
Heartseeker MH, distracting OH.
---
They have your back, yet telling you to give up, leave your server and re-roll on a care-bear server because it will be unplayable.
---
My back ground, I started WoW when Naxx: Necropolis hit. I started on a PvP server. So I was well behind the power and leveling curve. That still did not stop me from playing, nor did it sway me to go to a care-bear server. I stuck it out, joined a guild and did both PvE and PvP. The guild made the experience more enjoyable by supporting a lowbie/newbie.
---
I don't PUG.        
---
Hunter's sit in the Top 5 for BOSSES.   Not so much Trash.   It's a lot easier to DPS Onyxia as a Hunter,  Gar's Adds as a Hunter, Shazzrah, as a Hunter.     I never said they had the Highest DPS.    They're consistently in the top end of dmg for Raid bosses,   They have the best utility set.   They're able to Solo DM Tribute... Who else can do that?     
---
You're blind.    You proved my point.      
---
As a whole, normally if you have a lot of utility,  not dependant on groups,  have good kits you're not the 3rd most effective DPS group.        
---
Rogue's do really well because they're stats get padded heavily against Trash when they can Bladefury and hit 2 at a time.   Hunter's do much better Vs Bosses than Trash.
---
Wow. Congratulations, you've met the dumbest person I've seen for a long while.
---
not a ninja looter, fuck em
---
Priest
---
In vanilla I played on an alliance pve server. Once I got some epic raid gear it was outrageous not being able to use it to fight random people I met (unless they were pvp flagged).
---
By TBC I had rerolled horde pvp.
---
For main hand? Darrowspike is 1.50 speed, which kinda sucks..
---
Report for spamming?
---
You don't get honor from killing gray players and you  get a very reduced amount of honor from killing lower lvls anyway
---
Farm Ogres in Deadwind Pass for runecloth/gold drops/grey weapons.
---
Yep AV was epic scale in a way none of their other battlegrounds were.
---
BRD was the best instance too, due to its epic scale.
---
Does this not work because you can’t walk in/out of live side?
---
You would've still lost with a 2 and 50-50 with a 3 /s
---
&gt; struggle fighting 
---
You mean getting ganked with half life while fighting a mob? (Or doing the same thing, for that matter...)
---
Yeah most pre raid bis is specifically for group pve content. Sp is still good for casters but you do need int and stam as wel.
---
IBS isnt until phase 4 though
---
I hate people who can't just be patient in a dungeon. Once I explain my thought process most people are on board but if you're trying to do "quick" dungeon runs you want it to go smooth. You don't want to be ooming your caster and healers every single pull, you don't want to be popping oh shit cooldowns to survive. Taking an extra 45 seconds to pull mobs is quicker than running back 5 minutes and rebuffing and getting back into it again.
---
It's ALWAYS the DPS who are trying to push and push and push to get stuff done faster and its crazy to me. I absolutely love to DPS in dungeons. You don't have to talk to anyone, don't have to make any decisions. as long as you can DPS a tanks target you're golden. You have no responsbilities other than to follow the tank around and attack who he wants you to attack and if you do that you're well on your road to easy gear.
---
Spent my weekend tanking BRD as 56-58 war, so I feel your pain, brother. Got attuned and killed emperor on 4th run, because first two we were too low, 3rd run, after two hours, priest needed wand w +fire spell damage, so in retaliation mage ninjaed healing mace /facepalm 
---
But overall, it was good. Found couple of new friends, got invited to raiding guild and I can leave full BRD runs to less fortunate tanks :)
---
I tanked through vanilla and let me tell you its a joke now compared to back then, before every pull in vanilla we would plan out how to do it. We would always get at least 2 cc in the group so we could plan every pull and cc two mobs. Every pull ok? So rogue would sap and mage would sheep, if we had a hunter he would trap. So dungeons would easily take 2-3 hours. I have no idea if we sucked bad or the dungeons are just super easy in 1.12.
---
Why would it be the same if Locks have more than one dot they can throw on him?
---
Agreed, for me playing on a pvp server felt like playing on a computer that would randomly bluescreen.
---
Stonespine rise up!
---
"You think I care?" Why yes... Your actions demonstrate a level of caring displayed ONLY by someone who cares.
---
Hit up some of the Pvp videos with skirmishes on the larger Classic servers (Gehennas EU for example) the game grinds to a halt and becomes unplayable.
---
How private servers was able to do this properly and blizzards own servers collapse under the player activity is something I cant answer, but it seems to be the case at least.
---
Check the ranking on Warcraft logs for speed or execution and the top 50 for each is 90% alliance. There’s a reason for that.
---
You got a problem with l unoriginal names?
---
You don't understand. It really wasn't all that possible back then. The classes were reworked and effectively buffed, and Molten Core was nerfed, by 1.12. Of course it wasn't the norm, the classes were weaker in the earlier versions of the game. That's why they needed gear in BWL or higher.
---
Love seeing posts from Windseeker. Best server.
---
Troll Ethnoguild
---
your skill don't matter for shit if you don't have enough rage to use any abilities lol
---
Exactly. Things got out of scale. On Auberdine EU, there's still layering as well, no matter what they say, I've seen yet as recently as yesterday, switching layer after being invited to a raid.
---
And it's shit ! Too many people all over anyway, even with the layering, all farming spots are over-camped to death, even the worst farming spots. Can't even get yellow cristals from un'goro because of all the people trying to get some.
---
Yellow cristals being up to 40s EACH on this server ??? this is definitely not normal, too many people for too few ressources.
---
There still aren't flasks either, because not enough mats to support the so many active raiding guilds there are. Even getting greater fire prot potions is a challenge.
---
I think blizz really got overwhelmed by the success of classic, they expected like so many people claimed on the forums, that it would simply be a nostalgia rush and people would then quit within the first month, hence why choosing to have few servers with lots of layers made sense.
---
They expected the population 1 month after release to be down 4/5th, and be able to simply remove layers and have normal capacity servers, but instead what's happening is that maybe only 1/3rd of players left, and we're left with server pops in the 10 and 20 thousands, and since they have publicly committed to removing layers they just remove as many as technically possible without a care for the impact on the remaining over-populated layers.
---
I don't get anything out of pvp. Playing on a pvp server for me would just feel like having the computer crash all the time preventing you from playing.
---
Kinda bad I think. Most guilds want either zero or one even if they are fairly casual.
---
Which horde hurt you?
---
Those warriors can seriously go fuck themselves. I thought it would be the mages I would hate the most, since they seemed to be proper cunts while levelling up. But no, it’s the asshole dps warriors. These guys HAVE to charge in and spam every single ability they have right off the bat.
---
I haven't had to look for a feature such as this, so can't provide a good answer. I think I might have seen some "Mark role: healer/tank/DPS" function, but I can't swear to it. You can check out [this resource](http://murlocparliament.com/how-2-grid2/) which does a pretty good walkthrough of the different functions and options of Grid2. Lots of text and in-detail description, you just got to scroll or browse until you find what's relevant to you. Seems very nice, based on what I used it for when first setting things up. 
---
We usually distribute our healers a bit throughout the groups (for Prayer of Healing / windfury mainly) but being in a guild, healers know how the healers and tanks are. In a pug that changes from week to week, however, I see how this is a problem. I'd probably just memorize it, or mark the few crucial dispel targets with the marks not used for the adds in the fight. Grid2 does show a mini icon of marks on your raid targets, perhaps that might help? Or ask the raid healer to place all the healers on the topmost position to ease your life, or something similar.
---
Interest yer in a pint?
---
It does beat out both dals based on testing with the buff uptime. And zeal drops more than just in MC, we've seen 2 in Ony just this week. I picked mine up for 100g on blaumeux.
---
Abort/retake whatever the last chain is. If you’re just still in the one where you have to talk to the guy in tanaris you just don’t have the elixir, the quest to get the elixir is just a random repeatable quest so go back to the dwarf in feralas and repeat it
---
You dont need the flask as long as you die and go to the quest guy. The potion just kills you.
---
And then 8 hours, is what I think he means
---
I'm horde on Mirage Raceway and there's plenty of people online all speaking Engish. Occasional Scandinavian but they're always happy to chat in English as well.
---
Did you ask them if they had a fucking stroke?
---
Maybe he wanted to train 5 weps
---
Oh I agree. Its dinky as fuck, but the carry is real. Lol.
---
lucky you. What realm is it ?
---
we also had our first Rag kill last night, congrats :)
---
Imagine bragging about killing a rogue as a mage though.
---
some servers don't have transfers AND still are overpopulated.
---
Have you heard about our lord and savior Cenarius?
---
We have two retridins. One just slightly more damage than me. One does less.
---
Problem is that I tank. Retribution really isn't a very good spec.
---
You sound pretty toxic about this lol, in all honesty its groups like yours that were catered to after BC that made everyone require a completely  separate set of gear to PVP in. Dont get me started on the nerfs that screwed over everyone outside of arenas. Arenas never should have happened in wow.
---
This. It's also 50:50 H:A
---
Sometimes that's the only one. Like there's only 1 PVE french server. And it's overpopulated, for the in-game ressources and quest mobs, we don't have crazy queues though, like maybe 10 minutes every late evenings.
---
wot... im alliance here, and it feels like 55/45
---
What spec do you recommend then? My druid alt is approaching 60 and I was planning on going resto. I have heard moonglow/resto is good, but I have also heart hotw is good for the raw +int.
---
Try searching for established guilds that want to start split raiding, that way you could get a tank spot
---
Assuming you don't have a group with complete beginners and/or are underlvled/undergeared you can pretty much just go balls to the walls.
---
That is precisely it, that soundtrack as stuck with me since I was a kid for some reason
---
By playing after taking a break. When you have a lot of GP you wont get loot period, so why grind EP that will decay anyway? Its easier to just wait for your GP to decay. Every single time I have seen epgp being used this happened. Its simply dkp in worse
---
thanks, you too!
---
Maybe it’s my server but I’ve encountered far too many of these people, these “MLG pro gamers” who are just so much better than everyone else. The “gogogogo”, “tank go faster”, “what are we waiting for?” dumbasses who then take it upon themselves to start pulling when the run is moving at a perfectly fine speed and they are the only ones in a rush. Elitist assholes who think their time is just that much more valuable than everyone else’s.
---
you're perfectly right, don't know why people got to downvote you ...
---
Zandalar Tribes is still alive and doing well!
---
Chances are pretty much zero, unless you know people and find a guild willing to take you along because you're nice. Nobody actively looks for melee DPS, and there are about a bazillion warriors (and rogues) out there, who compete for the same loot but do what you do about twice as well.
---
I had an alt gain rested and when i was close to 150% i'd just dungeon cleave SM 30-44. Never leveled a char so fast
---
TBC and then WOTLK I think.
---
The classic+ idea that people have floated could be cool, but it would be way easier and cheaper for Blizz to just do follow the xpac path from back in the day.
---
Why didn’t they just ride gryphons to Mount Doom?
---
Main damaging attack uses 40 energy vs 60 energy and doesn't require positioning.
---
Combat brings riposte, higher offhand damage, extra hit, blade flurry for two targets, energy rush for oh shit moments.
---
Sub is actually alright for levelling with hemo spec (but you don't get that til 40) but most still use swords so combat swords is still better. Assass is alright but even at 60, combat daggers is better until better gear is obtained.
---
Combat is just faster TTK on most mobs (not waiting for gouge/BS energy (105) vs two SS and more white damage).
---
Why don't I believe any of those first 4 lines?
---
Then they should have rolled on a pve server. I know people with full time jobs who have two lvl 60s by now.
---
Why didn't Frodo just take a horse?
---
As a new hunter, Im a little overwhelmed with all the new abilitys and posibilitys. I heard cat would be the best dps pet, is this true? And what other pets would I need to get in order to get specific abilitys that are important on cats?
---
General feel from playing since day1 here and from a discussion few days ago on the razorgore discord - it might be wrong thats just kinda what people agreed on that it feels like. 
---
Anecdotal as fuck but we were like 10 players all agreeing its close to that. Could be entirely off ofcourse.
---
sorry, I edited in the link, I initially thought of just posting as link and then just forgot the link when I changed my mind to text
---
Now you are just trolling....
---
/startattack is better than cast attack because if you hit your macro twice you stop attacking.
---
Also just download "LETMECAST" it dismounts you, and stands you up from eating when you try an ability
---
Many Warlocks out DPS most DPS
---
I kind of envy you, you can get a feeling of progression WHEN (not if) you finally take him down. Keep working hard and the payoff will feel so much better.
---
Over the course of wow we often had this situation with people of our friend group having more or less time for wow.
---
Just open a chatchannel with your friendgroup, so everybody can always join no matter on what character or guild someone is at the moment.
---
Lmao
---
Lmao how come all the top parses on warcraftlogs use fury tanks?
---
Perhaps on alliance you can hold aggro off a fury warrior, dunno, but on horde you can't if they don't hold back.
---
Fellow horde tank from noggenfogger here. This is my sixth week of raiding. I was able to find a pug for my first two raids and joined the second guild I pugged with. You can look for pugs or create your guild and host pugs. Ony is much simpler, I've been hosting my own pugs. You can whisper Okaylo in game and I might be able to help you if these options doesnt work for you :)
---
I used to play with adsl and my average ms was 1000; on very good days 500 minimum
---
Most allys are like you Lmao
---
I've been maining a fury warrior for some years now (playing pservers for way too long), and I'd have to disagree with you. Tanking is so much more stressing than being a dps imo. 
---
When I'm tanking a dungeon, I am fully 100% focused from start to finish. I'm doing the pulling, I'm doing the marking, I set the pace and I assign cc's. 
---
If we pull more than 2 mobs I am constantly switching targets, following my attack bar addon, having to see when my next hit is, then switch target last second to spread out white hits on all the mobs. 
---
Many dps also don't really give a shit and just start instantly nuking, opening with Cone of Cold before you've gotten one sunder off, which makes it infinately more frustrating. I'm often exhausted after having tanked a few dungeons.
---
This was always going to be the case when they introduced Phase 2. Yet you still rolled on a PvP server. So if it does bother you, then you've only got yourself to blame.
---
You could argue in lower level zones (where 60s wont get any honour) that "fairer" world PvP will be more likely since the 60s will be ganking 51+ zones and that STV ganking might reduce (for example)
---
Sitting at 49, was hoping I'd be 60 before p2 to not get constantly ganked for a few points of "honor". Guess I have one more week to at least get ready for BRD grinds :D
---
Alliance has no convenient fp's
---
If click the mail and don't take the arrows out, the "you have mail" icon disappears and the arrows stay in your mail
---
Not to mention the fact that in epgp marginal items often get de'd instead of equipped (like choker of enlightenment or sorcerous dagger) despite being upgrades for some folks. Nobody wants to spend their EP on marginal upgrades.
---
People hate it and like to see "collusion" where it doesn't exist, but LC is simply the best system. Especially if you use something like RCLC to improve transparency.
---
That's what I said, not having a great weapon is not the biggest of your concerns in pvp when you're playing a caster class. It's a phys DPS issue.
---
Releasing the honour system without a BG system is a terrible, horrible mistake, but you will not suffer so dreadfully that you cannot enjoy the game. 
---
The fact of the matter is that whilst we have had some accurate predictions on the state of this game based on the private servers, there have been predictions that have not come to light. 
---
The only prediction you can rely on is one of logic, will you be ganked more when there is incentive to do so? Yes you will. Beyond this there is no certainty.
---
Noone NEEDS to buy anything, it's nice but it's up to you. Running from zone to zone is a lot nicer on a mount.
---
Maybe take a screenshot, then you can turn it in fast and read it during the corpse run.
---
It's the candy you can buy from halloween vendor (or get 30 of it from a quest), it has a few random effects - turns you into a pirate, skeleton, ghost, or makes you bigger.
---
for me it was the other way around..I often look other rogues, and ask where they got their armor.
---
One got that green one and I went for the quest chain. I would never have picked that quest, if I didnt look it up.
---
Its much more fun the way you experienced it. Gz! There should be less eyeballing others achievements, but thats the way you get it quick and efficient..but less fun
---
I tought it was just 40% movement increase, mybad, so yeah i should get it, but not rush it (im 15 gold short, and lvl 38 rn)
---
Thanks for the clarification man
---
It's absolutely amazing for playing defense in battlegrounds
---
Yeah camping flight points is super hardcore
---
Not at all. Hop into it man, have a great time!
---
Idk about that but currently it's overwhelmingly alliance guilds. like 70/30 ratio
---
Probably the only race that absolutely can't is gnome.

I'm venturing a guess that you a) lift and b) are German. Did I guess right?
---
BTW when are mages going for the fire build ?
---
You don't play alts?
---
I did learn gnomish, leveled to 260 for deathray and so on. Than relearned goblin to 300. got all gadgets and trinkets, cost me round about 300g. (Reflector trinkets r most expensive)
---
I don’t even like the alliance, but this still made me laugh lol
---
I’m heals, (lvling an alt tank) and I agree. everyone has been generally happy to have a group together. The handful, and I mean less than 5, times I’ve had a group that was turning sour from the start. When that happens I typically ask who ever formed the group to replace me and promptly leave. Not worth all the negative energy you can get from a pug group.
---
I don't know much about warlocks but I find it hard to to believe that 16 spell power could ever be better than 1% crit and 9 int.  
---
staff is definitely better
---
Why cant i find dummies like you when selling the rings?
---
I get at most 40g from people.
---
reseted xp takes 6.67 days to cap
---
Thanks guys, I was sure that the movement speed was just 40, not 60 
---
Mybad lol
---
Yup
---
depend of the server and people i'd say.
---
Comfort zone. You have one and you don’t save to stray from it. Fair enough.
---
Finding a tank for scholo isn't easy, but it is much easier than finding one for strat.
---
Do you lose your AFK tag when you get mind controlled?
---
The actual numbers dont matter, what matters is the frequency of upgrades for a group of people and number of people in that group. And that rate is very low in Classic
---
There would be more tanks if everyone would learn threat management.
---
yeah, works fine, get your whole guild to get it so they can assign buffs
---

Every race except gnomes can work as a all X race gold because gnome are the only race without healers.
---
Sometimes you have no choice (all your friends playing on a pvp server) or you are just misinformed (want the real deal, go pvp! / It isn't that bad, almost never happens).
---
Blizzard should probably enable once only, no return pvp-&gt;pve transfers
---
i need to set my chat background to be like yours ... now to find the settings
---
Cat is the highest damage on its own IIRC, but for leveling you might want something tankier and better at holding aggro (owls are a popular choice), and for raids wolves provide a party buff.
---
Dungeons can be tanked by fury specced warriors better than deep prot specced tanks. It really is a non-issue.
---
More than half the realms on EU are still layered.... Phase 2 will be a cluster fuck, especially on Gehennas where I play :-(
---
Getting Mira's song suuuucked
---
Regen is better at this stage imo. I run moonglow
---
No I haven't
---
I think enabling 2-factor Authentication helps with this.
---
Unexpected Danish
---
Leatrix plus has a feature to stand and dismount. Trust me it’s the best
---
I honestly have no idea. I've never played a priest, but that's the biggest one.
---
Dps complains about lack of tanks.
---
Goes absolutely ham with dps the exact nanosecond tank enters combat.
---
"Why won't warriors tank??"
---
Meh, its still a game.
---
If im getting camped i just go smoke a joint on the balcony, relax watch some youtube. If they are still there when i come back i just log an alt.
---
We used fire prot pots on our first run, had one wipe due to some people getting their positions wrong but did it no problem second attempt. Haven't used any consumables since.
---
And horde say fairbanks US is "60/40 max" it always seems more favorable as the dominant faction
---
You can't use wotf on you groups tank though, fear Ward is much better for that alone
---
Mail is 1h sometimes you need stuff right away.

Anyone know a fix to have my chat windows stay in place using Elvui? Ever since I updated, they default to another spot when I load the game or reload UI.

As a devilsaur farmer this is a long list
---
arcanite always costs a ton because of lionheart helms
---
I made it to 60 without doing lbrs, ubrs, strat, or scholo. I wish I’d spent more time doing dungeons from 55-60 instead of just powering through. Now I’m having to go back and farm, which is lame. Look at your pre raid BIS lists and grind those items out for exp when you are able.
---
So why isn't everyone playing a mage then? Don't you think there's something more to it?
---
A server can handle the load. That being said zones cannot when you throw several hundred people in an asmongoldesque pvp battle in a single zone.  When spread out it should be fine. This is why they had layering in the first place because the entire server pop was focused in the few starter zones.
---
morgraine is still layered and at low lvl its like ... 10 people per zone ... its an amazing feeling /s
---
Once the pvp trinket comes out that wont matter
---
I had a run where all the dps already had them so the two pally healers rolled on them.
---
returning instead of sending back sends it instantly.
---
as a mid 20s horde hunter alt in ashenvale i wish i read this a few days ago. why do alliance have two arrow vendors here and horde has 0? i get that there is a lot of imbalance between the two sides but this only screws horde hunters, not the faction as a whole, i don't get it.
---
Lmao I'm a sucker for not reading a sentence fully. Personally I'd just tell everybody that I wanted to raid and that I would be looking for a raiding guild and get everybody to go with you.
---
The ones who are inactive might be annoyed/upset but they're not active enough to really change the outcome. Those that are active should want to stick together so you all apply as a group.
---
hammer is useful for pvp but doesnt affect bosses, crit specialisation actually increases your dps for everything
---
Yeah I see them everywhere no doubt. I’m not saying everyone should go out and roll a mage haha, I could careless what everyone does. In fact I believe people should do what they believe will make them the happiest obviously. I just wanted to share my thoughts about the situation that I see Meme’d about daily!
---
Now way, youd beat my sad pve loving arse lol
---
Ok explain me beating most lvl 60 horde warlocks while I was leveling 55-60 then.
---
Ah yeah, good call.
---
The final boss is 47 - plus it spams adds. It's a tough fight, compared to stuff like SM or RFD.
---
It does reduce the damage for multishot though.
---
On the other hand, fast speed will get more improved aspect of the hawk procs, which is free damage (as in, you don't need to spend mana to get the damage).
---
For leveling, I would just pick whatever has the highest dps and best stats. For endgame I would recommend a slow weapon, as multishot and aimed shot become more important
---
Even then, 40% is still a HUGE increase over 4%, why would you not want it even then?
---
But zombie dragons!!! She would make the PERFECT leader of the horde, she's all about unnecessary spikes

About Us: What up!!! We’re a group of cool people looking for other cool people to come hang out in our guild. Nothing sexual. We are targeting a Nov 5th start date for raiding and need a few more members to fill our spots.  We’ve got a nice community of level 60’s and high 50s currently farming pre-bis and are more than happy to help people gear, however if you’re enjoying the journey and want to take your time we strongly welcome that too! We will also have an active PVP community come phase 2&amp;3. Again, nothing sexual.
---
Feel free to dm with any questions/concerns! I’ll be happy to answer all questions.
---
Man the original WoW manual had so many incorrect things, it was great.
---
Petopia is the place to go to answer all of your questions.  Cat is fine, but highest damage does not mean that it's the best for leveling.  I highly recommend boars because they can charge, dash, are tanky, and most importantly they'll eat basically any food you come across.  As you level you're going to get lots of random food drops, cheese, mushrooms, mystery meat, fruit.... a boar will eat it all.  If you have a more picky pet (basically everything else is a picky eater except for bear), you're going to be spending money on stacks of food to carry around for your pet.
---
In my defence it was pretty early on Monday morning for me.
---
To use not to buy or hold
---
Bear tank with DM buffs, I out-threated everyone, and had 2k more hp.
---
As the priest put it "I love healing bears, they're a giant sack of hp to use big heals on".
---
Dps warriors are loot competition. I tell them when I get into a group that they can either behave, or leave, because I can easily replace them, and will gladly do so to avoid competing for loot.
---
Amazing what that will do to curb bad behavior.
---
I do understand what you mean, but op said nothing about combat daggers, maybe im wrong in assuming thats what he meant. Lets agree that daggers in the game atm is lacking unless youre lucky and get a Perditions. Btw, Heartseeker is 1.7 not 1.8.
---
My worry is that phase 2 hits on the 11th. That means all people who **were** levelling alts will be back on their mains farming that glorious honor. Most 60's that were going to dungeons will be outside farming honour.
---
Going to be an interesting time now the focus shifts from PvE to include PvP as there's now reason to properly do it.
---
A-hole's choice too. Every time I ever get mad at a player of my faction, it turns to be a mage.
---
&gt; turn up and summon for ~30 minutes a couple times a week
---
Couple times a week? Is anyone actually progressing MC on multiple days? I had never raided classic and with youtube video before the raid and a small description over discord we 1 shotted all bosses in about 2/3hours
---
That is racist.
---
Depends on when you want to play. But yeah, during peak times the queue still reaches +1 hr. You said you wanted an active server though.....
---
MoP had the best class design / pvp balance / endgame content and raids ever.
---
Flight Master All right, then. Keep your services.
---
So posting it on the ah and waiting min 2 hours is better?
---
idk how you'd spend an entire quiver worth of arrows in 1 hour
---
You can shadowmeld at top of lumbermill in AB and toss them down to deaths when they try to capture the flag.
---
They die and get repair costs.
---
The mind control will not broke shadowmeld before it's fully casted (used to be like that I remember though in vanilla did this alot)
---
That's a real popular song! Who wants to hear of it fifty times more?
---
I was planning on investing at enchanting and enginering, to do some money (since im probably hiting lvl 60 next year lol). but now im inclined into buying it
---
Because I play a druid, and dryfuk mages with their own Frostbolts for fun. ^^
---
The healer for the healers
---
Nah on a high pop server its easy if u need 0 loot from there.  Your just salty you cant tank :(
---
According to op arrows don't have a deposit amount. I thought that was only enchanting mats but maybe not
---
Is soloing maradon feasible with pre-raid gear?
---
Does seem that way sometimes doesn’t it.
---
Purification doesn't scale with +healing. It is therefore not very good as soon as you are close to preBIS. Its value is helping you when you first start healing at 60 if your healing gear isn't great.
---
If shamans are raid healing (which they should be, and your priests tank healing), there is little benefit to going further than 21 points in resto. Mana tide + imp mana stream offers 20mp/5s. By comparison, chugging a major mana pot offers 75mp/5s, popping a dark rune 50mp/5s. Nightfin soup is 8mp/5s. Consumables blow mana tide out of the water, and I'd rather play a spec that can solo farm and DPS in 5mans and farm a few extra consumables. No fight is long at this point except for Onyxia, which is light on healing so you won't blow through your mana on her anyway. No other class is struggling for mana either.
---
In BWL you will have longer fights, but then if you have t1-level gear your mp/5s will be much higher.
---
You can make an argument for picking up Healing Way when you have t1 8/8 (and therefore can actually compete with priests for tank healing efficiency) but not really before this.
---
Shamans scale far more with gear than they do with talents. Few of their talents offer scaling. The most valuable shaman talents for raid healing are in the first level of the tree.
---
The resto talents beyond 21 points are useful for 5 mans (mainly healing way and healing interruption). But not for raids.
---
I did from vanilla through to cataclysm when I quit. I live in New Zealand. There were no dedicated oceans servers then
---
Your sample data is 50, not "literally thousands." You're literally selecting the top 50. 
---
And that is not how statistics work at all. If you actually sampled the top "literally thousands" and found the % alliance with fast kill times was significantly greater than the total percentage of active alliance raiding guilds, that would be evidence in favor of "alliance has it so much easier." 5% to 95% tells you nothing if 95% of raiding guilds are alliance.
---
Decursive
---
The vast majority is fine, even putting players on ignore the realm population is so large I simply don't come across them again.
---
Just don't do what I've done and be the only druid in MC/Ony raids and get all the T1 and T2 gear "by default", so have an epic healing set that taunts me...
---
We do it the other way, banish 4 adds, kill 4, then kill boss, then kill banished
---
Earthshaker EU

Best decision ever! people still farm but you know the people. This builds a community of helping eachother out.  
---
Just migrate to other servers before P2 is coming out. If you want the classic vibe go to smaller servers.

Earthshaker EU is high on evenings! feels really good and solid. 
---
Horde/Alliance almost 50-50. Alliance better organized than horde in Wpvp
---
That would be possible, yes.
---
HotW is a PvP spec so that doesn't surprise me. It's not really made to be an optimized raid spec.
---
You've got everything in reverse.
---
The OP (and others) can't get raid spots because raids don't need 8 tanks. 
---
As a hybrid, you're not tanking raids, you're tanking dungeons. If anything, hybrids who voluntarily tank are actually helping alleviate the tanking shortage that will arise when all those tanks quit (like OP).
---
And then on my server (Westfall-horde), people are selling it for 150g or less often.
---
Your mileage may vary. 
---
 I used to play a lot of quake 2 on dialup back in the 90s, my ping was usually 450-500. With most people on dialup in the same ballpark of pings.
---
I was one of the first to get broadband internet back then, my ping dropped to 80-100. It was amazing.
---
&gt;Or any other popular game like DOTA or Fortnite where people have things down to a science.
---
But then some random guy comes to the pro scene and builds memehammer on Invoker. And wins The International with it, becoming a millionaire. And next year he does it again.
---
Imagine having no sense of sarcasm
---
I think you're right, but wtof does have the benefit of active use.  I could just use it to eat the first fear, but instead, I can save it for getting feared into whelps.  FW being passive means that there's less control.  I think of all the differences these two skills come out pretty even on this encounter.
---
Had a dps keep spamming for tank to pull more. Kept saying that his friends in RL have no issues pulling the room and go fast. Tank said we can't pull more or we will start wiping. Everyone in the group agreed. The mage said okay bye then. Dropped party and pulled a bunch of mobs.... Ugh

I’ve made sure to make friends with the better tanks I’ve grouped with but most of them have either outlevelled me (I’m a slow leveller) or just aren’t on or available when I am :(

Druids don't care too much about int because their primary heals, rank 3 and rank 4 healing touch spells are so mana efficient. It's all about stacking enough bonus healing to compensate for using level 20-something spells.
---
Do the green quests!

Same my friend, I only played a warlock competitively not any other class because it was the most lenient for having a slow connection. Had no problems getting gladiator but I always wondered how much better I could've played if I had lesser ping.

Level 58 rogue still using thrash blade and vanquisher sword. What good stuff can I get that is not krol blade (can’t afford it)

Is something like assasination blade/ Hanzo sword or julies dagger good for off hand - for poison for example
---
i wanted to join you guys but im EU :(

Fuck yes this.

'We don't need to clear this small pack of 3. Just walk on exactly this line, stand here, don't move, kill any runners instantly and watch out for pats.'
---
Sure. Let's save 1minute by not killing that pack. But then you're at risk of losing 10 minutes to a wipe.
---
But arguing against it sucks. Because then you're 'inefficient' and not a 'good player'.
---
Damn it leroy
---
So much skill involved in finding the correct spot to gank helpless players 24/7 while living off welfare in your mom's basement. Or so I was told.
---
I personally am an advocate of defending ones raidspot with tooth and nail. If you keep your mats and go with suboptimal item options now, your chances to get benched increase. If you get benched you have no chance to get CHT, Perds, gutgore to begin with, therefore in the grand scheme of raiding, Heartseeker now is better to have a high chance to acquire an aforementioned dagger until P3 launches.
---
Once you have an MC dagger, Black Amnesty goes out the window anyways.
---
If you want really high gold potential you should learn to solo farm DM east. However it's far from mindless, and there is a learning curve. But for example yesterday I made like 250g in \~2 hours (I was lucky with arcane crystal drops from the rich veins). I know a guy who got 2 foror's already.
---

Good luck in suppression room then

Literally every warrior in my guild is capable of tanking dungeons as fury or if they feel like it they slap on a shield.Even some healdruids/palas have a tanking set.The tank shortage only exists for obnoxious people without guilds, or people unable to make friends. Oh no, classic is a social game and i need to make friends. The horror! It's one of the reasons classic is such a great game. Either you participate in socializing or you fall behind. It is the most important skill in Classic. It is the difference between farming reed with 4 people you know and everyone having it after a few  runs or having to do 7-10 man groups with randons for days. It's the difference of running 1 dungeon after searching for 2 hours to find a tank locking all the orbs for him or having a friend whos 3-way splitting the locked orbs between his 2 friends who came along. Maybe instead of constantly whining about problems, which only exist if you are unwilling to find solutions, you should work on finding those solutions.

Duskwood, Ashenvale if you are frisky and not afraid of Kalimdor, Wetlands.

Recently a level 1 twink used them while defeating Hogger.

Devilsaur
---
Because the only way for him to afford a mount was to sell the ring
---
Correct is a pretty loose term here. The best we can get is an estimate, the site itself even reinforces that
---
Prot/holy is actualy valuable in a raid if you have enough paladins, to throw Sanc on everyone to reduce damage, and you only lose out on Holy Shock, which is kinda useful but not crucial.
---
Im one of those players. The number of times someone dies or wipes the group to skip a pack that takes 30 seconds to kill, resulting in a 10 min recovery is high enough to make me always make the dungeon 3-5 min longer and save myself the 10-20 mins recovery from wipe(s).
---
Green quests are good depending on when they became green. If it just became green recently you will get full exp.
---
People dont know the situation of spanish servers but holy shit its fucked.   
---
 Blizzard just made a massive "fuck you" to most people and added too many servers or added em way too late.  
---
Seriously, spanish server is never layered, took em at least 1-2 weeks to be created and even then, I wasnt sure if i wanted to play there because most people are going there BECAUSE THEY DONT KNOW ENGLISH, more than anything, which is fucking sad playing there
---
&gt;  and they can even rival them on dps easy
---
A two second browse of warcroftlogs will tell you that no, they can't "easily" rival them on DPS.
---
i don kno mon, dis be seemin kinda racest to mee
---
should have said "All right, then. Keep your gryphons"
---
Nice dude, i am happy for you!
---
Really nice taking a screenshot when you can see that everyone is from the same guild, it makes it even better!
---
the hyenas in wetlands, which other people were farming
---
i've stopped playing since then though, got tired of it all
---
Yeah that's a point I didnt consider. Time to stock up on water/food and park yourself inside a dungeon for the next month haha
---
It really depends if you yourself want to PvP. I personally could care less about it, but I do care about needlessly getting 5-10 min corpse runs. Wasting time in WoW is already built in to many parts of the game, why add more unless you actually enjoy the content (ie. PvP). I rolled PvE and I can just play what I want in the game, PvE, without being inconvenienced.
---
Yeah, actually being able to use aimed shot without clipping is great.  With a faster ranged weapon during dungeons, I'd open with SS, then wait for an auto shot to go off, then weave in a multishot.  If I wait for an auto shot now with my 3.3 sec crossbow before multishotting now, it never goes off because my targetted mob dies before that happens.  So now I'll open with SS then multi-shot (in a guild run with a good tank) and FD immediately after.  Then I can start weaving in aimed shots strategically.  I honestly thought I'd be aimed shotting more, but it seems like more of long-fight ability.
---
You're going to run those dungeons many times anyway, might as well do it while leveling (if you can find groups).
---
If you do all your quests at 60, you'll get a shitload of gold
---
Gear progression is such a hard thing to tackle in the long run. It's the same as power creep in animes like Dragonball, Naruto etc. 
---
What do you do when characters become godlike? Introduce even better gear? Make new stats? Give other incentives?
---
Gear progression can only go so far before it becomes ridiculous statwise. 
---
Guild Wars 2, which basically had no stat progression at all, had fractals which gave resistance gear that made it possible to progress to higher level fractals dungeons. It gave no other stat advantages over others, which also removed incentives to farm it for me personally. Getting those stats and that sick looking gear is what drives most of us.
---
So what is the ultimate solution to a never-ending Classic? Where do we draw the line? Should there be an end to the rainbow or should it go on forever?
---
Since when is a Frost Mage an Ice Mage?
---
Mages, together with warriors, are the most played class. Almost 1/5th of all WoW classic characters are on level 60 are mages.
---
You literally just said you could barely tank the run, but now you are dick-measuring?
---
I am speed! Adadadadada
---
That's exactly it, and the reason classic is, imo, better than retail: the social community.
---
You can just mail your self instead from an alt
---
100 hp to 120 mana

Can you tank ragna with this even though you only have pre-raid bis ? kinda [like this](https://sixtyupgrades.com/set/ctsE2HoWk4ndepU529ohnU)
---
Fun fact, Method also was a troll only guild for a moment. Kek.
---
Where is Ron Bergundy saying he doesn’t believe it?
---
You don't seem to understand how statistics work, or how data sample affects how case here. Let me simplify so that you can get a better understanding of the situation, ignoring how rude you are being while being entirely clueless about what you're being rude about.
---
Imagine that you are able to run a 100 meter dash in 10 seconds in average, while I can do it in 9.99 seconds in average. Both our time are similar, but I am 1% faster. If we were to run 10 races, we would win half each. I am faster but but an amount that is so small that it is not enough to make a difference over only 10 races. If we were to take who was the fastest over 10 races, my 1% advantage would not show up. It could be either of us being the fastest.
---
Now we do 100 races. I am 1% faster and as a result I end up winning 51% of the times. On the top 10 fastest times, we are still split 50/50.
---
No we do it over 10.000 races. I am 1% faster and as a result, I end up winning 51% of the time. On the top 10 fastest times, I have 10 out of 10 of the fastest 100m.
---
This is what you are missing here, and how statistics, especially applied to large numbers work; over a huge sample of races, since I am 1% faster, I will be able to get a better time than what you could do once every 100 races. If we do this over a sample big enough of races, the top 10 of fastest races will be accomplished by only me.
---
The fact that you would miss how simple that truth and spew some arrogant crap on it is baffling. If Alliance guilds had a huge advantage, you would see 0 Horde guild among the top performances because of the huge data sample.
---
Get back to the black board and work on your comprehension of statistics and large numbers.
---
Or worst &lt;3
---
Awful by both of you.
---
Thrash blade is pretty good even at 60. The only real upgrades to it I think outside of raids is krol blade and Dal rends. for an offhand you just want a fast weapon, something like heartseeker would be okay, fel striker if you manage to get it.
---
people with too much money on their hands
---
No, very possible. If you're holy spec with decent gear, you could probably heal all the way through emperor (assuming your tank is good and at least lvl 55-56).
---
Is it really so great for leveling..? Wolf gang for life
---
He actually said it isn't a big split over a large amount of guilds*, at least quote him correctly.
---
Shush. Don't tell him. We have to keep up the act.
---
There are around 50 multibox streamers atm and some run varied setups, you might find viewers but like any stream you will start out small and need to have that **something** to draw in the watchers
---
*would've
---
They had a pony but couldn't take it through Moria.
---
This is like Instagram for Classic now
---
Damn I’m sorry. I think my only real drive to play is to catch my friends at 60..
---
Cute
---
Who read this as Count von Count? :P
---
General rule I follow for dungeon minimums is final boss level -4 for DPS and up to -6 for healers. Anything lower than that for DPS and you're probably not going to be able to do any meaningful damage.
---
&gt;  In battlegrounds, it's not the best. Not the worst. Need to rest between fights.
---
Say what? Please show me another class which can, almost effortlessly, win a 3v1 in PvP. Furthermore, a Mage isn't fully dependent on 10 or 30 min class cooldowns, like rogues.
---
This, but it's fun to see all the doomsayers with their paranoid "opinions".
---
Except provide access to a recipe that is worth a couple thousand gold.
---
Right?? Just feels SO much easier to level with the mage then my other 2. Like literally night and day.
---
That name surely is a blast from the past!
---
Without getting into all the math behind it (there's a fair bit), you want 305 weapon skill, and hit up to 6%, the crit to roughly 35% (raid buffed), then start stacking hit again.
---
And getting that 305 weapon skill is more crucial than anything.
---
Wow,and what are elemental fires going for on your server? 1.5g?
---
Is that the post where we can vent our frustration as tank because god I almost rage quitted a group yesterday. 
---
Strat live side, 2 rogues and an affli demo. Every loss/range pull, they would not care about the marked mobs and each rogue was ambushing one mob, never letting them reached me then running arround. By the time the mobs reached me they had all 3 dots by the demo. The priest was great at healing them, but generating insane amount of threat since he was healing them all the time. It was a nightmare trying to catch that I did not even touched yet (so with no rage) all over the place and having 45s down time for the priest to drink.
---
got that exact robe yesterday, after doing UD like 30 times now. 14% drop chance my ass
---
DKP is a terrible system because it turns the game into a job to earn 'money' to buy 'gear' with. Then of course you just have everyone cheating it 100% of the time.
---
Loot council is at least transparent in that it will show you if the council are shitstains, where as DKP tries to hide it behind math and other bullshit.
---
My server has 2 layers and from 6-10pm we have queues with 1k people
---
You can have multiple stacks of arrows in one mail message from an alt lol
---
Are your weapon skills completely leveled (300/300)? That is the only thing I can think of right now. If you're using a damage meter like details, try checking how much % of yellow hits are missing, that might give us an idea of what's wrong.
---
You farmed FAPs? What are these? :D
---
Ooh I can’t wait to make the guild mates uncomfortable with some of these. /sexy /beg
---
I used to deliberately get punted up to the high ground. However that obviously wouldn't work with level appropriate content
---
Fury/prot can tank all content, though I would say that deep prot is better for Ragnaros particularly, because you are in so much fire resistance gear that your stats suffer, and fury/prot is highly dependent on hit and crit.
---
Can't look at those talent builds (at work) but just google fury/prot and you'll find plenty of info.
---
Glad you got a guild running for all the special needs kids. Real nice of you
---
Daily thread topic as this point.
---
You cant expect people to play a 2004 game with a 2004 mentality. If it's moving too quickly for you, then I'm sure you can always find a nice alterative game to play. Like candy crush saga.
---
&gt; Barmans is generally banned from pve for knocking off nightfall corruptions. 
---
most guilds wont care
---
anyway by the time someone has nightfall then the few dagger rogue probably got an upgrade already
---
you should be good against level 63s and skulls.

around 3g. I've actually been making bank on fire pots just buying the mats and crafting the pots.
---
classic has been my first wow experience. My one friend who has been playing for many years keeps telling me how to spec and stuff for BiS stuff, but I tell him I'm just tryna enjoy this vidya game i dont really mind not raiding and stuff
---
It do be like this
---
Bears are honestly the easiest tank to heal, as long as your healers don't have mana issues.
---
On longer fights or harder hitting fights, where mana starts to become an issue is where the weaknesses of bear tanks start to come into play. But with appropriately geared healers, there are no such fights in classic yet.
---
Same I never have any of these problems at all. I don't have a problem with tanking though and set a pretty fast pace so never feel like I'm struggling to keep up
---
tanking without having a single mob hit you is so frustrating xD .. especially running around trying to collect mobs
---
Interesting, do you have any data supporting that claim?
---
https://www.engadget.com/2007/03/16/samwise-didier-warcraft-icon/

This, put them on  ignore and move on
---
We saved so much money on shoes that we made a guild. ..
---
I didn't see it in the first few posts, but there are (or were) diminishing returns on honor, so that you wouldn't want to kill the same guy for the (i wanna say it was after like 5-6 times?) because they are worth 0 honor.  Maybe for a rogue its low effort to keep killing, but as a priest, I would have to sit and mana up at that point, so I wouldn't spend the effort. 
---
I am making the assumption though that its a few people and not a bunch of groups. You would still be worth honor to the other people. So you maybe dying those 5-6 times each, to those groups.
---
(and also the assumption that diminishing returns will be present in Phase 2)
---
Alliance Windseeker checking in
---
Stop looking at your xp bar and try and enjoy the quest/story lines a bit.
---
Your hit percent doesn't effect a mobs chance to dodge as far as i'm aware. Someone can correct me if i'm wrong but bosses 3 levels above you have a 6.5% chance to dodge you, which can still happen from behind, separately from your chance to hit. 99% chance to hit is the max as well so you're never truly have 100% chance to hit. It's more like you have a 99% chance to hit, and then if you hit the mobs have a 6.5% chance to dodge.
---
Tbh If you take 5h to complete BRD, the 5 member are to blame.... I mean ....yea.
---
&gt;I would say that it’s because the amount of level 60s have gone up. PVP consumes will go down again. Trust me
---
Not according to the private server historical prices. We'll see. :D
---
hah, my friends pretty much gave up too. i got to 47 after playing some more, but the grind and the scarce quests got real boring. at least i got most professions to 300
---
Ah noo, someone already salty they'll get corpse camped in p2 so they have to make up random bullshit to make themselves feel better :))
---
Everybody missing the icon and just talkin' macros... nothing to see here
---
This isn't a. Public service announcement
---
I love LOS pulling and fury warriors charging halfway through so mobs split between the healer trying to save the warrior and the snared charge target. I get zero rage and have to futilely taunt a target at a time and hope I keep aggro with one Maul every few seconds.
---
God forbid they do it on a five mob pack. I have had to Roar on random trash so many times.
---
I'm having same issue, even with low level mobs. E.g SM elites at lvl 60. This is not a simple resist it's a bug
---
But in p2 with world pvp you dont wanna get trampled cause u got a 60% mount.
---
Read his post again lol
---
/e KreaHS pickpockets 72 Silver 22 Copper from you.
---
You thought you did, but you didn’t.
---
Basic Minimap or Sexymap. I think Leatrix might let you do it as well.
---
You should join the Classic WoW Warlock discord as well, people are always willing to help in there.
---
Is the blue quality pvp gear going to be available in phase 2? Atlas loot says it doesn't come until phase 6 and just the epic gear is phase 2.
---
I’m lvl 49 and was wondering where I should quest? Most of the quests I get I can’t do yet
---
i think you'll have a much easier time in phase 3 when bg's come into play. find a pvp oriented guild, or start one, who raids to get gear and you'll find groups who are glad to have you. might have to suck it up and healbot till then. 
---
in phase 2 go to pvp hotspots and buddy up with geared warriors. if you make an impression they will seek you out and get you a raid spot.
---
People who go out of their way to kill low level player repeatedly and camp them deserve as much corpse camping as you can give them.
---
This method should work if you form the group before you enter the dungeon yeah.
---
Yesterday right before logging I finished a huge p1 goal of mine: Breastplate of Bloodthirst. Was it neccessary? No. Should I have prioritized my epic mount? Absolutely. I wanted that chest badly though and the opportunity came up to get it at a semi reasonable cost, so I took it. That's the essence of classic wow, set a goal (even a technically suboptimal one at times) and go make it happen. 
---
My guild was pumped I finished it, and all the alchemist pitched in an xmute to save me some gold like champs. It was such a hype moment, as we'd also just killed ony for the first time as a guild with no pugs
---
You should've named yourselves "Trollnly"
---
“With my guild”
---
People that low dont give honor, nobody is gonna waste their time on people who dont give honor, jesus christ you guys are hillarious
---
True, but if you're gearing correctly you're not prioritising mitigation over avoidance (after a point), and so you're dodging a lot of incoming damage. Sure you still get crushed/crit in raids, no getting away from it, but you can certainly reduce your incoming damage significantly, saving the healers' mana that way, and your increased HP compared with other tanks means you can eat a big hit at half hp and stay alive long enough for the big heal to land.
---
Tank entitlement, just do your job and take all the damage.
---
What server is this, ill check right now if every dungeon is camped lol
---
mage is for plebs who like easy-mode in all things. Don't have to travel to Main cities, can produce own food / water for regenerating after fights, can kite like forever , AoE Farm ... i hate mages.
---
DUNGEONS DONT NEED TANKS, THEY NEED PEOPLE WITH CHARS CAPABLE OF TANKING. Hope the big letters help. There is no tank shortage, because you literally don't need a tank for dungeons. Any warrior/druid/paladin with a random assorted collection of blues for their appropiate gear type can tank dungeons.
---
The pool for people who can tank dungeons is MASSIVE. Around 20-40% (depending on faction and server) of chars can tank dungeons. Around 20% if you only count warriors who are actually better dungeon tanks as fury, than ANY prot specced guild or wannabe main tank.
---
I assume you are referring a situation like this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFLuRDTLM6A
---
I didn't see anything like this in WSG &amp; AB in vanilla. One immune/resist dude will break your rotation and you'll have to blink and flee. Or a warrior &amp; warlock will hold you busy enough to let others ram you. I said battlegrounds, where everyone is expected to get cc'ed.
---
I prefer rogues over mages. Wait for an opportunity and attack. Not dead? Flee. You'll get your cd's while waiting another opportunity. That's how you play rogue already. Like that mage does 3v1 easily, there was a rogue streamer that gets sniped every time, was killing mages like a critter.
---
Warrior with a healer is also better than a mage with a healer. IMO shamans and paladins that knows how to play is scarier than mages. Don't want to get 1 shotted by a shaman or kited like a toy or locked while holding a flag with by a paladin.
---
Druids are also biggest pain in the a** class. Can't kill you. You can't kill it either. Try to cap a flag or a base while it's on you. End of the day, it works.
---
It's really just idiots desperately trying to sell it for a huge sum of money since that's what it was going for before DM released, but no sane person is going to pay more than 200g or so for a Warden when the mace from DM N is almost exactly the same thing.
---
Why would i be fighting a mob when im grinding honor
---
Guess he/she is maybe going for 5pc T1/3pc T2 but until then, yes - maybe use T1 helm instead.

And still your whole messege was just pure bullshit, i wanna break it all down for you but it was a long message
---
It does, but should get renewed every time someone deals damage to you when you have it. At least that's how it works on retail, so given it works the same it would be an inefficient method of farming HKs, better to get people on the way out or stand in front of dungeon portals getting people on the way in.

Get fucked.

In WSG, and 1vX, sure.

One of the first things I noticed this time round was the massive numbers of warriors were being played compared to how I remember vanilla. Even at the end of the first week I was thinking: "there is gonna be a pretty harsh selection process going on at end game"

clever use of FFA mechanics.

I swear, every rogue deserves to be ganked lol.
---
My tip would be to not use SS. Ever. It's terrible. Unless maybe you have considerable downtime in a dungeon due to an undergeared tank/healer.
---
No because a lot of people that would abuse this HAVE to have the raid with them, they can’t get in alone and cause that much damage.
---
Penalising everyone stops it completely
---
Here I was thinking PSA stood for "Player Sharing Advise".
---
Windseeker NA
---
In retrospect, it's so obvious. Don't know how I didn't realize how it sounded.
---
He's not saying his spec is the optimal one. He's saying that the content is easy enough that the optimal spec isn't needed if you're not terrible at the game.
---
Jokes on you, tanks don't exist
---
Dungeons exist
---
you can pretty easily dungeon level 40-60 in zf \ brd , if anything it should force more people to dungeon level
---
With phase 2, people are going to be grinding honor and trying to rank, not camping lowbies.
---
If you are having threat issues, either you or your tank are doing something wrong. Even if it's not a Prot specced Warr, just chill a few seconds before opening up and you should be fine.
---
Then why roll on a PVP server?!?!
---
Searing gorge is nice at 49
---
I needed like 5 silver so in thunder bluff i was on a corner rping as a beggar begging for anyone to spare a silver, i was having fun with it and would give up after 5 mins or so. But a dude gave me 30 silver. It was a good time.
---
But the realms that have queues will often still have layering to offset the issues with crowded quest areas. Without layering Skullflame is still populated enough for this to be a problem.
---
Frankly in such cases I support corpse camping as long as possible. They can always spirit res or log off.
---
&gt; I showed you how after looting an item(in the default case), a single MC clear is enough to offset the cost of almost any item
---
Thats the problem. You did not. Its not about EP vs GP but your rate vs those of the other raid members. And there is simply no way you can compete after just receiving an item when drops are that sparce
---
#HumanRacialPower
---
Sounds like both methods are good!
---
nice job! im on skullflame but ill  follow u on stream
---
MC attunement requires lvl 55 and is easily done in BRD.  Ony is a long chain that will take you through BRD a couple times and UBRS.
---
“dps pulling aggro and dying”
---
“i out threat everyone”
---
🤔
---
&gt; But I did complain about rogues a lot.
---
If you played on EU ragnaros as a horde there might have been a chance that you complained about me, cus i ran around tyr's hand with full bwl/AQ40 gear oneshotting fresh 60 mages like a douche.
---
The best fights is when someone attacks me and they get destroyed, so yes its LITERALLY the best.
---
Realistically you won't be able to contribute, as the level difference will be too large for your spells to hit. If the guild invites you to join, it will only be to make sure they don't have to disenchant loot.
---
Yes
---
&gt; what’s the best class to complement him with?
---
something you'll still enjoy playing after he quits.
---
Yo, that's actually so dope. I wanna join!
---
Yeah guess rogue would be better burst. Instant 1, if not 2, players right away. Was thinking warrior and pally longevity and burst. Rogue would do just the same. Probably faster.
---
I agree with your point, there's a lot of slow/bad players on this subreddit and it's a noob ass echo chamber lmao but god damn son. You can't run your mouth like that these days. We on reddit. Good players are few and far between. Everyone has feelings and they are all valid. Be more considerate of other people's experiences, even if they are noobs.
---
God damn I miss world of ming, arena junkies/rant room, back before all the good players quit and the game's skill ceiling completely nerfed down through horrible horrible changes
---
It helps a lot with Onyxia in P3. It's always useful to keep it on a tank, at least.
---
Hey now, give undead rogues some credit too
---
41 Lock on dreadmist. New to classic/wow in general. Looking for people i can do dungeons with regularly/raid with when i eventually get there. Not looking for a sweaty guild...
---
YO TAUNT!
---
Maybe you were killing mobs that were just a bit too high for the level. I've found that I can clear quests and areas much faster if I'm only killing mobs my level or lower. The small xp loss is more than made up by the fact that you take less damage, deal more damage and thus this never ending dark pact enabled farming works much better.
---
I can only say that it works for me ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Enjoy Garr.
---
if you have a normal job, 4-6 hours of gameplay a day is pretty reasonable tbh. 4 is for people with other hobbies and 6-8 is for people who just play games after they leave work
---
Lol chill out
---
Sorry if I don’t feel like grinding SM for literal days on end.
---
If you had parries, you weren't behind the boss.
---
Pretty sure you're talking about DM East whereas OP is asking about DM North Tribute run.
---
Yes, in fact I contribute doing just that to almost every horde I came across to being the reason I didn't get ganked at all from level 30-40.
---
Icon goes away when you view the mail, don’t have to take the items.
---
I think it works for classic. Encourages people to show up for raid, raids are not hard enough that you really need to optimize. Seen it encourage toxicity in retail, but in classic, raiding is a lot more chill. That said, dunno what raiding is going to look like long-term in classic.
---
In retail, loot council all the way though.
---
Yeah I can see this happening to me BIG TIME
---
Wasn’t aggro :)
---
U dont get honor from players in redridge... These stories seem like exagerations to me.
---
Dispelling the magmadar enrage helps but isn't required
---
A man of culture
---
If you Think you can take off the bomb with ice block in the middle of the raid without moving, you are pretty dumb to start with. But hey this private player doesnt know much about the game right? Gl wiping your raid being a noob who doesnt know hes class at all. Read hes messege again please and say again hes good in anyway. Sigh...
---
Mobs can still dodge and parry your hits, always stand behind your target if you can.
---
How? He joined a raid group and was informed of the loot plan, regardless of the chest being ffa or not. How would this fly in a higher tier raid? Or are you actually justifying to ninja in pugs?
---
Yeah but if you forget to send them back on an alt they get auto returned, AH mail that expires is lost.
---
You fucking nerd, I'm proud of you.
---
Some people don't understand classic loot distribution. Try being a holy paladin with those people around
---
Shadowmeld into mind control to make them jump off of high places.
---
That's about it.
---
Cause you had to pay for a portal xD 
---
I am a mage,  since 2006 but I am mad at mages with those portal sells and stuff.
---
All of the servers that were up at launch time are like this. And sure, they offer transfers from high pop to low pop servers, but that's not really an option for most guilds at any point past the first week. By now many have an alt or two, so you'd be looking at transferring \~500 characters or more. When they have stated that a transfer may be closed at any time, they take up to a couple of days to process, and they do not guarantee that every transfer is made that is initiated etc, you cannot risk transferring an entire guild.   
---
The layering they introduced has only worsened the problem, because it hid just how many was on each server at launch. Otherwise people would have actually ran into these problems during the first days, and would have actually switched server.
---
So you want an active server, but also one without login times.
---
...
---
Weve ben doing mc and today we shud do ragnaros. So hypu.
---
My friend grinded Ice Barbed spear then unstoppable force back in the day and we had a lot of fun together. I had 4 pc felheart and the rest pvp blues. The gear power level difference isnt half as bad as it is in retail. A person in dungeon blues can be competitive. Sure it’s nice to have better gear and you can completely own with it, but you can also outplay someone and win when you’re less geared.
---
Relatively recently joined a new smaller guild of friends/ Friends of friends after leaving the largest guild on the server over drama.
---
 I went from being actively disliked by the leadership and considered by the MT as a meme to a guild of laughs and warmth, an active discord,  and a core raid tank with an MT who wants to utilize my advantages to the fullest every chance he can
---
Finding a good guild is an absolute game changer
---
Might be a bit of a long reply but: where have you already done?
---
I'm horde and from what I understand the areas available are:
---
* West Feralas, final few quests
---
* South Felwood
---
* Last bits of Tanaris
---
* Searing Gorge
---
* Final bits of STV/Booty Bay (message in a bottle, pirates, ape island, elite quests)
---
* Hinterlands 
---
* First bit of Azshara
---
You can annihilate anyone in world PVE with that combo. But it's not a best choice in battlegrounds where everybody is expected to get CC'ed. A furry warrior knows what he's doing can play with casual mages like a doll. I'm not saying mages suck. But if there is a 1-10 scale, mage is at 8 or 9.
---
Human Rogues with Combat Sword spec only need 2% hit from gear to be yellow attack hit capped.
---
&gt;“dps pulling aggro and dying”
---
At no point did I write that.
---
So that would be you lying and trying to pass it off as a quote.
---
Is it really that hard to accept you're wrong, apologise and move on?
---
So, by very interesting PvP project do you mean just copying the CDL tournament?
---
If you think that's a great idea, you're an idiot and it won't be long before you are banned.
---
no, i want active servers :P . but 1-2.5h que times wich ive had on my screen to log firemaw now and then is a bit absurd :P .
---
I use AuctionLite with Booty Bay Gazette from Curse. Pretty straight forward
---
I play on Pyrewood and theres way too many mages, hunters, warriors and priests. Seen very few locks and rogues.
---
We get a ton of loot council refugees in our guild. A lot of people who didnt get any loot after 3 raids because it was all given to officers.
---
Alright. I haven't used that since vanilla, but stuck to Grid since what feels like forever. Easy to set up, minimalistic yet can be packed with information and with high degree of customizability. If you're a healer, you will want to use this (or some other similar unit frame add-on).
---
Or be an engineer and use superior guns instead of puny bows, make your own ammo.
---
"Bear tank with DM buffs, I out-threated everyone, and had 2k more hp. "
---
Downvotes are from hordies who hate to be reminded they are choosed on purpose the overpopulated side.
---
Just to add a comment in favour of Warden's, it is more aesthetically pleasing!
---
Yep I give mine away to friends and guildies, I can’t be arsed selling it for the 5g people want.. yet they’re constantly spamming trade looking for them. Even if mines off CD I’d rather keep it in case someone I know needs one done.
---
Like... I can stand in IF and unlock boxes for 30 minutes and make 5g while I watch Netflix. I’m not giving away a super useful 48h cooldown for that.
---
&gt; We basically had adds spawning right away and running at us together with the boss.
---
that's very interesting and i wonder if it was a stealth nerf from the patch that had all the hunters worried.
---
Golden Pearls are over 50g on our server (Mograine EU). 
---
Since I have to level up my Broken Tooth from level 37 to 60 I decided to kill the Sirens in Azshara. Low HP caster mob with 80%+ chance to drop big mouth clams. BT is at level 47 now with and I have opened around 400 clams and not a single golden pearl yet.
---
The g/hour sucks but I keep doing it because it is super fast to level my pet (around 30 mins/level).
---
Spells, abilities, and just about everything are grouped up together and occur simultaneously on "ticks"... and that was used in the past to help with ping issues, etc. It was essentially fixed and/or reduced in the retail version of the game since networks because tremendously better.
---
Classic is Classic, so they impletemented the original batching... now stupid stuff like this happens. Batching in Classic also makes it really hard to interrupt spell casters. The spell will still be successful even though you interrupted before the end of their cast.
---
Yeah, I had considered whether or not we could save characters another way. The bigger issue, even with this, and that there are actually 11 ranks of this spell &gt;_&lt;.
---
Phase 2 causes so much salt and butthurt that it has torn space/time and started happening before it even launches.
---
But there's not 20-40% of people who WANTS to tank, doesn't change the fact that tank is role that is the harder to find in classic and doesn't change the fact that only 2 people per raid can really tank if they want it.
---
I mean you're not discussing my points but just ranting about the subject
---
Hit Azeroth in the morning for easy questing. If waking up and going to bed earlier isn't a problem
---
I've always felt that mount is worth it cause I spend a lot more time on a mount than I do in a dungeon or raid. I was a wrath baby though so I haven't done much endgame in classic.
---
*crossing fingers* 
---
pls not just crit montages
---
Side question, because I can't remember - in 1.12 did you have to queue for BGs in Cities/BG entrances? There was no world queue/BG finder, right?
---
It sounded like he was talking about dps ruining LOS pulls, getting knocked back into extra packs, and/or pulling extra packs with AoE. He didn't really complain about dps peeling mobs off.
---
There was another dude in this thread that complained about that, so maybe that's where the confusion stems from!
---
Eh, use it on dungeon bosses.  No reason not to.
---
Ah shit I thought hemo was the 31 point talent, haven't played my rogue since Vanilla. 
---
&gt; it feels more like a rogue than combat did even if it is slower
---
No denying that, but OP asked why combat is good for levelling - not which felt the most rogue like.
---
In all honestly you can level whatever you like as a rogue, I did assassination (in Vanilla) from 40-60 with Widowmaker/Coldrage then Barmans shanker &amp; Julies Dagger. It was wild as I was stun locking all my enemies in PvE and PvP. Took me longer but I preferred it.
---
&gt;Sometimes it even scans multiple times before buying, i go to buy something, search for it, click the item, it searches for posts, i lick on the item, try to buy and it starts scanning again.. I buy 1 stack, it starts scanning again..
---
Didn't see anything like that.
---
I use it to scan for having a database. And asily post items in AH. Put item in the slot, click search and sets the lowest bid/bo amount automatically.
---
the kind of people who corpse camp lowies for hours are allready doing it without honor system
---
If you run into issues as HoTW druid in MC and Onyxia, your DPS isn't doing anywhere near the damage they should. No healer should be able to oom in MC or Onyxia if the DPS are killing the bosses at a reasonable speed.
---
I typically argue this along the lines "Are you certain that this random group of players will play perfectly enough to make the odds of pulling the skipped pack less than 1:10 so that it is on average faster to skip it and wipe sometimes? Will you vouch for them?". Followed usually by pulling the pack in question since I'm the tank and I do the pulling anyway.
---
It should and as far as I’m aware will be available in P2
---
Yeh, I originally had Herbalism because on pservers, thorium didn't sell for shit, but when I hit 60 and started farming high level herbs, I found that they were the ones not selling for shit, while thorium was selling for a lot. Plaguebloom, Dreamfoil, Silversage, etc...are literally going for like 5-8 gold per stack, meanwhile Thorium goes for 10-12g per stack with 45-50g arcane crystals. Promptly dropped Herbalism and picked up Mining instead; funded the entire 900g for my epic mount almost entirely through arcane crystals, lol
---
If I'm not melee, I never want to be in melee, to this reason, and becuase I lose the 130% threat pull value and can pull at 105%
---
Yes. Groups probably won't invite you though as there'll always be a level 60 dps wanting to run DM (at the moment any way).
---
Depends how good u are. 
---
if u do it in 9 minutes like 80g hour. if it takes u 1 hour to do a single run then 10-20g an hour.
---
it's not an easy farm.
---
I must have missed that. Thank you!
---
How exactly do instance lockouts work? Everyone is saying you need 12 minute runs while farming to avoid getting locked out, but the weakaura thing (which seems very consistent overall) seems to suggest that the timer only starts once you exit the instance, meaning you would actually need 15 minute runs.
---
Being worth more than enchanting mats: it's not much, but it's honest work.
---
A level 48 gives the same amount of honour as a level 60, given you're a 60 yourself.
---
I was referring to the context of 2 months of Classic, so Im not going to argue semantics. And no, I disagree with you and your elitest mentality, my guild raids for fun and we do all of MC and Onyxia in ~3 hours and have fun doing it as a big family of best friends. With the way you talk I'm not surprised youre not used to that kind of environment.
---
Sap / Blind x2, kick
---
Polymorph, counterspell, frost nova
---
Hammer of Justice, BoP, Divine Shield
---
This would be OP af with the hefty burst dmg everyone have. Rogues can literally stop 2/3 members alone while mage kills someone through HoJ
---
Can confim, farmed a lot of Eles for the HW rep. Sometimes you are lucky and get 3 in 10 mins othertimes you see 0 in 40 mins. But overall it sure is not more than 5%.
---
I have never found a mailbox that doesn’t also have a vendor for arrows.
---
Which leg enchant is better? +8 Agi or +1% Attack Speed?
---
I'm assuming the agi, but it's much more expensive and I'd like to confirm that first. After some Goolging I didn't find much that compare the two.
---
Yes, not sure what triggered it, but we wiped and decided to go with the above mentioned strategy instead. As long as DPS cooperate with you and help with adds it becomes more manageable. And bring some higher levels than 41/42!
---
This coincides with people now saying mages are the new hunters. Apparently back in vanilla all the noobs (myself included) rolled a hunter because it was dubbed the easiest class to level. Now people have a better understanding of the ins and outs of the game and Mage is the new beginner class because of how easy it is
---
I have run UBRS a dozen times in the last week and I haven't even had the misfortune to lose a Need Roll on them, they simply haven't dropped once.  You'd think they wouldn't be so hard to get, based on the amount of Rogues, Druids, Hunters, Sham and Warriors standing in Org wearing them.
---
TBC and Wrath are already planned for classic . I'd prefer classic+ but it's not going to happen.
---
&gt;  but no sane person
---
Good thing there are plenty of insane people in wow, even more so if they are playing a druid main tank, lol.
---
There will always be people who wants the absolute best of the best and willing to pay even tho it's only marginally better.
---
I would never do that, but I would also never main a Feral Druid in classic wow... Too much work without the payoff in my personal opinion. At least if you are a rogue you do incredible damage, and warriors can tank anything, priests are better overall at healing...
---
To me, maining a druid in classic is crazy, but boy am I glad people do because that buff is da shieeeet.
---
Tomatoe tomahtoe
---
0.21%.  Good luck.
---
I dunno, I wasn't really paying attention to what nouns the other guy was using. But if I have to make something up, an ice mage is any mage that only uses blink and ice block and blizzard? Blizzards are made of particles of ice so that counts I think
---
Not purposefuly :)
---
I want a spot where I can be lazy and watch TV while doing it, it makes great gp/h, AND no one knows about it! And I want the people that know about this hidden goldmine to post it publicly on Reddit for nothing!
---
Wait... I always thought Alliance was just real shitty programmed NPCs?
---
Only polearms, which are 1g.
---
The raid was fine as a whole but I felt the spec underperformed compared to other options.
---
How does +weapon skill work and is it different for a hunter?
---
Edgemasters are BIS for dps warriors. Aged +dagger gloves from MC are best for dagger rogues. But I dont see anywhere the LBRS gloves with +bow for hunter. I got them and feel like they should be good... :-/
---
Anal [Hemorrhage] was always my fav
---
My breakthrough hasn’t happened yet cause I’ve been 60 for over a month and killed rend blackhand 36 times without getting dal’rends sacred charge
---
Ohhh no the gurubashi trinket! 
---
Eat shit, the guy owned you fair and square. 
---
Best strat would have bin to have 4 guildies spam AOE and another 4 spam clicking macro, pref bind on scroll forward and backward.
---
If you don't want an enhance shaman in greens rolling on gear don't bring an enhance shaman in greens.
---
Any good mage will rip a rogue to shreds unless the rogue is really, really good. He has to use all his cooldowns to be of any danger to the mage, otherwise, the mage can just kite him until hell freezes over.
---
...or two hours...
---
I don't think anyone's really angry about the limited supply. Maybe, though.
---
I think instead that people are mad about the people who virtually AFK and buy up everything available as soon as it pops with macros/addons. I have \~150ms latency, so it is literally impossible for me to ever buy these recipes. I don't mind that I can't get them all the time, but I do mind that I can't get them ANY of the time.
---
That's just me, though. YMMV
---
&gt; PvP to the same importance as PvE is a big
---
? this is so wrong on so many levels. pvper have to pve for gear, have to pve for essences, have to pve for necklevel, pvp hasnt seen a balance change in months.
---
pvp literally gets treated like it doesnt exist. 99% of the content released in bfa is pve content.
---
Same. Ashbringer as ally and Mograine as Horde. Just started though.
---
Yes, but no
---
what?
---
Tanking isn’t happening in raids unless you are a dedicated early member and preferably the GM himself. Offtanking sure but most of the time u gotta be DPS.
---
Buy lionheart/edgemasters/devilsaur. Go fury.
---
Melee gets reduced glancing blow penalty and lower chance to be dodged from having higher weapon skill, while hunters only get hit. So those are basically 3% hit gloves, which isn't amazing considering you have plenty of hit available on blues, and once you start replacing them with raid gear, giantstalker gloves are just far superior.
---
Chain heal is on average more mana efficient. This is because healing waves typically have an overheal between 20-35% whereas chain heal is often below 10 or 5%
---
He's saying that the only Horde mages that kill him are undead.
---
If it had been nothing nobody would have cared, but you got a nice piece.. boo-hoo
---
Couldn’t care less about the loot, I have pvp gear already sorted, it’s the principle honestly, just wanted some feedback. It’s on sight now for any horde or ally that isn’t in my raid.
---
It's not "overhyping" there might be a nice and friendly community on smaller realms, but there's not a competetive environment on any realms aside from the huge ones. You're also only going to have 5 really good guilds on the average realm, compared to dozens of amazing guilds on the huge servers.
---
I started in TBC and didn't know about Black Lotus, but I kept seeing people here talk about them early on, and how the value was gonna shoot up. Well I used all my gold I had saved up and bought 50 of them off a dude for 12g each and I sold them all over the last couple weeks for 40-45g per. Absolutely insane
---
Uhm Warlocks are super strong levelers as well :P
---
So outside the meta spots listed (Devilsairs, Ess of water in Felwood and EPL, Satyrs in Azshara or Felwood, etc) that everyone is already at.  Here's some other options:
---
1.  Ogres by Kara - Runecloth, pots, greys, greens, etc.  Can extend into undead by and under Kara for same drops.
---
2.  Tanaris Red Turtles - Down past Lost Rigger Cove are turtles that aggro mixed with elite giants, drops clams that can drop Golden Pearl's.  This can be done with Azshara Naga / aquatics in the ruins too.
---
3.  SFK - drops a lot of crap, also drops high value BoE twink items.
---
4.  Feralas Sprites - flame sacs
---
5.  Any turtles - speckled shell frags are a grey that stack to 5 and vendor for 45s.
---
Those set bonuses seem crazy good (I have little context regarding healing in vanilla especially Shamans). Makes me sad looking at the Rogue ones.
---
It should be. There was a blue PVP set originally, but in naxx patch it was replaced by a higher quality version, which is shown in atlas loot. We don't know which version we will get yet.
---
It'll be nostalgic for when I get hardware that lets me hotkey well again xD.
---
I remember a topic on the forums when Burning Crusade came out called “Lore is died”. Basically even then people thought they were ruining the lore when Draenei ended up being eredar and crashing their spaceship only to not have much technology other than casting spells and swinging swords and riding on elephants.
---
Why do you need or want layering in towns and cities? Nothing you do in a city is time sensitive, and crowds increase the feeling of immersion amd community. If the servers can handle it, and I'm sure they can, cities are the place there should never have been layering.
---
Isn't laying to assist with quest mobs? It would be redundant in a town or city wouldn't it?
---
essentially, expertise works different for ranged weapons. you need 15 expertise for every 5 melee weapons need. So its easier to just stack the hit you need instead.
---
Yeah im always behind. But didnt know hit rating cover only "miss". Ty for answers.
---
Not with epgp. There it wont matter :)
---
&gt; Depends how good u are. if u do it in 9 minutes like 60-80g hour. 
---
Doesn't anything faster than 12 mins hit the  5 dungeons per hour limit?  Is there something magical about DM Tribute that lets them escape this limit?
---
It can also be interrupted I believe (like the warlock mount cast) and lock your holy tree.
---
But still very situational.
---
Hi there. I don't really play wow, but I'm trying to follow the lore. Can I play wow classic solo for exploration purpose? Do I need other people to play raids and dangeons?
---
Are you comparing raid pve event to free for all pvp event?
---
Go go go go go go
---
Yah but it's also MC.
---
Mage is the overall best class in vanilla.
---
Tip tier if not the best DPS, top tier if not the best solo gold farm potential, top tier if not the best PvP class. Downside is itemization and gear competition.
---
could be a different thing when many thousands of people come there because streamers are there, the game would probably crash
---
essentially, expertise works different for ranged weapons. you need 15 expertise for every 5 melee weapons need. So its easier to just stack the hit you need instead. Also white hits cap is higher for rogues and warriors since they are dual wielding.
---
Elemental Fire are super steady at 5.5g and Black Lotus 70g+ on Mograine EU. And we are still layered...
---
Yes, and you're not under leveled for it especially as a DPS.  However, you're going to have to start your own group because there will be plenty of level 60 DPS for groups to choose from.
---
Yes but I think we all understand what we meant to say :)
---
The problem with hurricane is it competes with verdant keepers aim. I would pick up verdant keepers aim at 45 and if you wanted an epic then buy the dwarven handcannon at 53. 
---
Hurricane consumes more ammo, makes getting off autos while trying to kite a pain and will yield significantly worse results when you get aimed at 51, even as BM.
---
You pull it, you tank it.
---
Eventually they'll stop, or they'll say "wtf tank?" and leave. Both result in an improvement to the group.
---
Yeah, circlejerking rarely gets downvoted lmao
---
DPS warriors and mages are the new hunters, while hunters are actually typically at least decent. It's like a fucking fever dream. Bizarre.
---
undead mages are the bane of classic wow
---
&gt; only to replace a year later with a green 
---
Wut? It's not at all certain if they're gonna do TBC lol. And besides, what else do you do atm if not raiding?
---
He means the faster he fires with high crit chance the more crits he'd get.
---
Selling tarnished Elven ring, 45g
---
Not a gameplay question but would like to know if you have any suggestions on people/pages to follow on Twitter regarding Classic. Started following wowhead but it was just much regarding retail which I'm not interested in. So something which covers news and interesting events and such on Twitter?
---
&gt; A furry warrior knows what he's doing can play with casual mages like a doll.
---
Have you, like ever, played classic PvP? Any half-decent mage will eat warriors for breakfast. They aren't even remotely able to kill a mage without a FAP.
---
you're still ahead of the mass. good job bro
---
Is it active now? or will be when Phase 2 is up?
---
A good portion of the game can be played solo as most quests can be completed solo, and world exploration can definitely be done solo as well. However, all dungeons and raids will definitely require a group. That being said - the community is much more approachable than other group-based games of recent times (Destiny 2/Division 2 come to mind) and the guild/chat system is so robust, that finding groups and friends to play with is super easy!  
---
Another thing to consider is a role-playing server, where people play out their characters and stick to the lore closely, which gives it an extra dimension of immersion.
---
Do Maraudon or DM Tribute runs.
---
But my post was about tanking in general and how there's so few places in raid for people who like to tank in relation with how much tanks are needed in dungeons. 
---
You didn't address my points and just started ranting about how fury warriors are good in dungeons and people always whine. So yes nothing to discuss because you are talking about something different
---
Yea so edgy, pvping on a PvP server 🙄 what a loser!
---
I also wonder this. The wiki has the following example:  
---
* 1:00 : Instance 1 entered
---
* 1:10 : Instance 2 entered
---
* 1:20 : Instance 3 entered
---
* 1:30 : Instance 4 entered
---
* 1:40 : Instance 5 entered
---
* 1:50 : Instance 6 Unable to enter. You will simply walk through the portal without entering the instance.
---
* 2:00 : Instance 6 entered
---
But doesn't really mimic what I experience. Doing DM east runs at \~13 minutes a run I get locked out for around \~10 minutes on my fifth instance.
---
You prob don’t need to respec at all, just dish out what you can and have fun
---
I played most of my time on pve serv, for the first time I rolled on a pvp server. Until now there is not much difference except :
---
*You encounter griefer that farm low level and you either change zone or change layer (thanks god for that)
---
*You get killed by some people while you're killing mobs (most people will not attack you), but you could have the same result on a pve server activating your pvp tag, and even then most people would have attacked you making it a real pvp experience since you would be expecting people to attack you
---
*You get killed by group of people, while it's very rare by people solo, group are to be avoided
---
*People get chain kill in front on donjon / raid making going to them a pain
---
*You get killed in neutral city / hub by people exploiting guard (gadget) or people killing you when reaching flight (searing)
---
*World pvp right now is lower than on my old PVE server since you tend to create a group on pve server to attack a town and force reaction since you can't go around killing people questiong
---
* Big positive is you can contest mines and plant, but only against opposite faction
---
So from what I see right now, pvp server are overall a way worse experience than PVE server
---
YOINK
---
Yep, there are several bots on my server at this vendor day and night. It's honestly impossible to get any recipe from her and these bots list the recipes on the AH for a significantly inflated price (Runecloth bag recipe is ~70g normally), which no doubt ends up being RWTed.
---
I know no-changes and all that, but Blizzard needs to change this vendor to remove this clear avenue of RWT. There's simply no other way to curb this as the accounts are suicide bots (so require no time investment other than summoning a fresh character there) and can simply be replaced within seconds even if those controlling have zero backup accounts.
---
You can explore the world solo. That's part of the fun of WoW. Tons of exploring and running around to do.  The world is a dangerous place though! Especially on a PvP server... :)
---
For raids and dungeons though you will need a group (unless you're much higher level than the dungeon).
---
Yes and no. Lets take this example - imagine one layer is 3k ppl cap and your server has 3 layers and still have queues - that means you have 9k people online and more in the line waiting. now p2 hits and layers are removed. Will you see 9k people on one layer ? Im 95% sure that thatbwill not happen and you will have 6k more people inqueue waiting to log on
---
Venoxis
---
I’ve heard serious gold makers say TSM (tradeskillmaster) is the best and most powerful AH addon. It’s too complicated for me though.
---
Oh when was this?
---
I ran Uldaman the first time Saturday, and a second time Sunday.  Sunday afternoon was the fail.
---
How do I play like that? Any guide to "stick to the lore closely"?
---
I play on a medium pop server and have a notes addon to remember these guys. HF finding a group after pulling that shit a few times!
---
It's selection bias. People with bad experience will complain. I had no bad experiences so far but I am not making any posts like 'hey guys I had a perfectly normal ubrs run today'.
---
You need a 3rd party member.
---
Run both toons to entrance.
---
You Invite Random. Enter instance, Make Random leader, Log alt , Random Invites Alt alt enters instance,
---
Random stays outside, you swap chars back and for as needed.
---
When ready to reset, Log both toons have Random reset, then log back in and both your toons are at start again.
---
thats called sharding and the whole point of layering is that it's not sharding
---
Chests anywhere are ffa, so yes he is. This could be the same in any pug, in any dungeon or event with a chest.
---
CLEAR COMMS
---
Yeah the GMs don't care as there is no offense in this case
---
i would recommend Hunter or Druid for a playstyle focusing on solo exploration.
---
Just fly really really high, throw frodo off with the ring in hand, hope he hits the lava.
---
The content hasn't been released yet.
---
Keep in mind that the pre-raid BiS gear lists contain items that are very slightly better than other available options.  The reason that these gloves arent on that list is that devilsaur + the set bonus is so good.  If you get some outstanding pants, like T1 or T2, you would probably benefit more by pairing the LBRS gloves up and drop devilsaur.
---
I've created a character just to try to buy the recipe for the runecloth bag. I log in a couple of times in a day to check it, and there's always someone there.
---
20 days, and I still haven't bought it.
---
Ragnaros loot does not come from a chest and molten core is not a pvp event.
---
Not everyone is cut out to be a tank. If you want to be thanked, maybe you're not the right personality for being a leader.
---
Honestly yes haha. Ally is out numbered on every pvp server but fairlina
---
I don't know unfortunately. I'm currently not logged in to check. But I'm pretty sure it won't show up as the honour system isn't up yet and players give 0 honour currently.
---
Bloody hell, best get myself booked in for a dyslexia test.  Thanks for taking the time to clarify your point to me!
---
Ok. Majordomo chest, Uldaman boss chest. What about that?
---
Done it on warlock and lock can't go to the upper right like you did using Mind Soothe. If you are warlock, you can't skip the ogre packs. As lock you go directly to the courtyard and pull all hyenas together, killing them with dots and using the ledge to keep them away from you (there will definitely be some video like "warlock DM north hyenas"). Boss kill is the same like with priest, on the same "hill".    
---
Doable basically in any common spec as warlock (Ds/ruin, SM/ruin or SM/DS) and not hard, just need to get used to a few things.
---
Does it matter? Entrusting a random dude in a FFA PVP event is same with trusting everyone in a pug that will click greed on items that they do not need. This is why nobody raids in "group loot" mode.
---
Also you have a chance to attack the chest opener in FFA PVP event. But you can't stop a random dude from pressing that dice button.
---
Same.
---
Honestly, just go PvE. You're looking for confirmation, but just rely on what your gut is telling you. I have characters on both, and I enjoy the PvE experience more. Half the time I just wave to the opposing faction and they wave back. Real life is full of mean, idiotic, selfish a**h***s, and most people playing on a PvE server are doing it for the same reason you are, to have fun and brighten their day. PvE is for those who crave an escape. There are people I've met on the opposing faction that make me wish I could add them to my friends list. If you are playing this game to feel good, go PvE.
---
You can disable the "one bag big" feature in BankItems (I like separate bags better too).
---
/forfeit
---
What threat meter works in classic?
---
Majordomo chest is still raid pve event. Gurubashi arena is FFA pvp event with no rules.
---
Pro tip, leave 2 trailing spaces at the end of a line and then press Return to begin a new line without paragraph spacing.
---
With your username, refer to the part in parantheses.
---
I really don't get why this sub thinks retail is easier
---
The work to get tri-exalted in BG’s even with premades is heavy work and takes a loopoong time. Even with rank 10 gear and tri-exalted you’re only equivalent to most molten core geared classes. In fact molten core weapons are much better than their BG-reward counterparts.
---
Then start a guild and be your own MT and raid leader. You missed the boat on getting a tank spot for a serious, established raiding guild. Those filled out months before the game even launched.
---
Its easy
---
Yeah indeed. That's exactly why you can't compare the two.
---
If you kill her does it reset her inventory?
---
Lower queues on Ashbringer
---
No, you won't get banned. I live in the EU and play on a NA server. I use a VPN to change "my location" all the time. Even when the DDoS was going on, I didn't have any trouble with my account (just the servers were FUBAR'd).
---
If you really want to be "safe", just use a VPN to show you as still in your home country. It'll jump your latency by \~50ms (in addition to the \~150ms that you'll have by playing across an ocean), but it's very doable.
---
It's been some time; I'd guess 2-3 weeks, but I forget.
---
As a tank I just safety pull the pack anyway. What are they going to do, kick me?
---
&gt;You overstate the ease of AOE at low levels
---
True...
---
&gt;without good gear you go oom
---
...Unless it's your second character and you keep it kitted at low levels for pennies on the dollar!
---
don't take randos to do shit that should be handled in-guild
---
Don’t need heals if you just stack alchemists and first aid! Science shall prevail!
---
I wish more ppl were like you. Personally, I never really attack anyone unless it's revenge or when trying to help someone who's getting ganked. Still, I get it when people attack others of a similar lvl because pvp is exciting or anyone who's competing for quest targets. But people ganking low levels for no reason? That's not something I'll ever understand. Or ganking one person as a group, for that matter.
---
Of course, all of that will change once the "honour" system rolls around since you gain something from ganking ppl. So I suppose the people ganking greens or grouping up are practicing for that? But that doesn't make sense either since they shouldn't need practice for winning such an easy fight...
---
I'd never have rolled on a pvp server if it hadn't been for all of my friends going on that server. Now, pvp has provided me with a few of my most fun moments, but also with all of the least fun moments. Despite me being terrible at pvp, I doubt I'd reroll on pve. Maybe I'll make an alt on a pve server while I wait out the people farming honour. Though by the time we get to phase 2, I should be lvl 60, so I could just instance farm for my bis instead.
---
Anyway... rant over I guess.
---
True, I've died a few times due to this.
---
Just checked the vendor for the first time and got my recipe!!
---
So, if you could choose:
---
Fear ward on a 30 sec CD or wotf every 2 Min?
---
Gutgore is nice for pvp
---
Druid is sick as well for the fire resist buff.
---
Yeah just go engie. You’ll be amazed. It’s like playing a new game, and it’s really not that expensive to level it high enough to be useful.
---
Ignorance?
---
My first character a decade ago was on a PvP server and I didn't understand the concept and almost quite because of it.  These days I log onto an Alt immediately if I'm being camped/ganked in the open world.
---
People like you who get this worked up over PvP in a PvP game is why these "subhumans" think ganking is fun. Like seriously, chill. It's a game. The point is killing each other. Do you also get this mad at campers in CoD or whatever?
---
True. The general theory of tank gearing that I've followed is focus effective health until you can survive the biggest hit (or hits) that the boss can dish out, then focus avoidance until the healers don't go oom healing you, then shift back to effective health to allow for "oh shit" moments.
---
On Blizzard servers? Or Private servers?
---
And the difference is just because it’s pvp his shitty actions are justified or what? If he ninjad the majordomo chest or ulda chest how is that any different if you were informed of the loot rules 3x while in the raid group?
---
Trusting random in Gurubashi lul. Sorry, but that's like going pug raid with FFA loot and hoping noone will ninja the loot :D
---
Good for you if it works. I personally never was in a dungeon with an arms tank after i hit 60. But if it works, why not i guess? :p
---
4 warriors, 1 resto shaman, windfury everything to death.
---
Or shaman for spookydog form and astral recall.
---
&gt;lose
---
And yes people that tend to attack you do it because they know they'll win, most people are not attacking but the one that do it always do it when you don't have a chance
---
Ew this is a horde post, please see yourself out.
---
Its not as simple as "attack the tanks target" in vanilla. At the beginning of a fight, tanks are often tabbing thru targets, and while dps can certainly wait, not all groups want to go that slow. Speed it up by directing your dps where they need to be. Not all players know every mob in a dungeon, their skill sets, or even the location of pats, and all that. Don't feel like marking, then don't expect your dps to do exactly what you want them to.
---
Obtaining the drink is a repeatable "quest". You can do it as many times as you want in Feralas.
---
Alliance is full of flakes and role players hiding in goldshire.
---
I get where you’re coming from. Warrior MT main with a theorycrafting side.
---
But remember P2 is coming in a week. Epic mount isn’t some QOL upgrade, it’s a survival necessity for leaving capital cities.
---
You know I can scroll up and see what you wrote right? 
---
Just admit that you couldn’t resist bragging in a thread about how poorly you tanked 😂
---
Because you can stop him from looting it in the pvp event.
---
"...If you don't keep your feet, there's no knowing where you might be swept off to"

---
I've waited for respawn and it was empty... but there was an orc next to me who was, perhaps, quicker. Still, she has (I think) 4 different recipes, it's kinda impossible that orc bought all of them so fast.
---
Thought I was going to see the rag loot be 2 shaman T2 pants and malistars lol
---
i hear arcane is the way to go
---
I agree, I rank in a semi reckless in smart way clearing fast. People add me after runs all the time.
---
As if this post were "hints" for other players, like you and your 5 hour brd runs are the authority on this game. You made this post for validation and to stroke and be stroked by other bad tanks.
---
Honor has diminishing returns. If you kill a person a couple of times ,the honor will be minimal. Killing early level 50s as a level 60 will give very minimal honor to begin be with. There are bigger fish to fry and better ways to get honor. 
---
I'm sure there will be more ganking, etc, but I don't think it will halt your play enough to where you wish you hadn't rolled on a PvP server.
---
But, yeah, if you don't want to be victim of open world PvP (however lopsided the situation may be), then you should be playing PvE.
---
Hunter
---
Dying
---
How do you kill that which has no life?
---
Tanks in dungeons. There you go again.
---
I'm 25 but I feel like a grumpy old man because all I do these days is bitch about zoomers.
---
I just copy and pasted that from a lyrics site I did nothing to the spacing myself
---
Firemaw gets full every day
---
that was definitely happening on LH after classic was announced, there was a whole meme guild dedicated to it
---
but I'm on gehennas and haven't felt any corpse camping yet, the server with a shitton of pserver try hards
---
I guess it is kinda a psa only because people playing these days just read the wowhead prebis and think that is 100% the gear I have to get.
---
Mate there is like no hit gear atm, and for the few slots where hit does exist you're better off with higher sp options, that makes it like a 17% chance to not hit. When fights take like 60-90 seconds as they do right now that definitely pushes a lot to RNG
---
im about to hit 38 and don't know where to level next. I did most/all of the northern STV quests. Wen't through Desolace except for the two southern kill quests. Dustwallow seems too spread out. Idk if i should just walk through Badlands next or grind a dungeon until 40
---
ye its absolute aids, only item and missing, and cape from baron. think ive done 16 runs and haven't seen them drop. my friend on the other hand, literally had them drop 4 times in a row...
---
Take that shit elsewhere.  Some or us are successful and happy and people are proud of that.  So we play video games and socialize with our friends online?  Wow that makes us less manly?  Ridiculous
---
Pagle!
---
My server has a guild who keeps their (about 7 of them) 60 alts in the STV Arena. They collectively log on every 3 hours, guard the chest so they can loot it, then log off. It's fucking dumb how much time some people have.
---
Wow you got all of that from me thinking P2 is a couple of weeks early. 
---
And who around here is taking things too seriously?
---
I mean you are accusing someone named JoJoPose of trolling you? 
---
He seems to be an anime afficionados too.
---
Anyways, for your question, no class in WoW will really compare to those caracters. Maybe rogue are what will be the nearest in term of class fantasy (dual wielding hard hitting class) but WoW is not really anime-like so no huge dash nor leap or anime-like moves whatsoerver. 
---
And this is what others are trying to tell you but can't really take you seriously because classic player are more often than not grown-ass adult in their late 20ies mid 30ies who doesn't have a clue about anime. 
---
(btw if I can recommend you something, is to start to watch really good anime instead of those 2 ones. Those are good but not so great :/)
---
which is why the good ones carry like 40x FAPs at any time.
---
Other ranged classes can fuck with mages too in a BG. Warlocks, Priests and to some extent Hunters, Druids and Ele shamans.

Guild Name: Midlife Vices
---
Server: Herod Horde
---
Focus: PvP
---
Raid Times: I think we are going with Tuesday nights.
---
About Us:  We are a guild comprised of some more laid back folks who like to PvP.  Most members have other life obligations (like family, jobs, etc.) so we are not a 'realm first' type of guild and will never be. However, we absolutely love to PvP. We have formed up many PvP raids since launch and we've been on Herod since day 1.  We currently have 120 members but are looking for more to fill out our raid roster!
---
Recruitment Needs:  We just need some solid members.  We've been pugging MC fine but we'd like to do 100% Midlife Vices raids.  We weren't planning on doing raids very much until November and now that it's November it's time to hunker down with it!
---
Expectations: We have a pretty good culture of being laid back and PvP oriented. Some people recently have been having some anxiety over raids (we haven't fully cleared MC), but most of the guild is really just content.  So, the expectation is that you join knowing that we will be slower than most guilds and won't complain about it! The other expectation is that if you were to raid, that you'd come with us!
---
Join our discord or PM me if youre interested!  [https://discord.gg/8UYXZU](https://discord.gg/8UYXZU)

Test Prop/Tren Ace injecting every other day. Daily Clenbuterol to start with and towards the end he messed with DNP.  
---
He used to take lots of cocaine too though, so all that paired with a heart defect and it caught up to him.
---
You should use either claw or bite, there isnt really a reason to have both apart from dumping a ton of damage/focus at the start. 
---
Mostly just leave them on autocast. I found while leveling I would pull aggro if i didnt leave growl on autocast.
---
Inventory items, in general, have always been frowned upon in duels. Grenades included.
---
Constructive. Thanks dudes. I didn’t know you could attack someone in your own raid group, regardless of location. I’ll chalk that up to me not knowing. It’s on sight next time
---
More details for those who are interested [in this picture](https://imgur.com/yOcZ2C8)
---
You didn't have 4 mages in mc?
---
Those queues only exist around peak times, and it’s a good safety net against the server EVER dying.
---
Private servers weren’t. On Nost when pop went really high a good portion of the playerbase was met with severe lag and delay.
---
Hello everyone, I'm a level 51.4 druid. Realistically I can probably get to 55/56 by phase 2 release. How gimped will I be in the leveling process?
---
Thank you, I’ve actually tried plexus and it essentially is grid but I get lots of lua errors, again even if it’s the only addon installed.  
---
I appreciate the info.
---
The real one or the "Kïrìtø" one?
---
What they're doing wrong is they're not a bear. Bears are actually better for multi target threat than warriors. Warrior tanking in general is a lot more technical, there are more opportunities to screw up.
---
Both classes have their strengths, warriors have better itemization and avoidance, but bears are actually amazing. I GM'ed a raiding guild in vanilla and TBC and we did all kinds of out of the box shit with hybrid/offspecs. We had a bear MT for large portions of progression content. I would lean towards a bear over a warrior on a DPS race. We also made extensive use of pally tanks who would RF spam and trivialize lots of add pickups. We always wondered why more guilds didn't do this.
---
Low quality attempt at twisting words.
---
LETS JAM
---
The problem is that "nobody does that."
---
I would love that... Cause I am not in MC for the loot. I got everything I ever wanted from this years ago.
---
What I want are some interesting fights.
---
If a dps warrior ever ninja loots tank shit I'm alt F4ing and going for a walk.
---
1-2 2.5 months
---
So 2-&gt;6 10 months. November +10 = August/September.
---
good luck with it! ^^
---
PvE is a fake utopia, an abomination of riskless cushy endeavors propped upon a pedastle by sensitive nerds who are unprepared for the harsh lessons life has in store for them
---
PvP is the real world, gritty and dark, harsh and unforgiving offering only mere glimpses of light that you twist and hold on to as if it should justify the glowering darkness within which you wallow
---
Yeah, people have this rigid view that runs need to be tank/heals/3 dps “end game”. Reality is that a skilled cleave group is still superior even end game.
---
Basement dwellers don’t like it when you point out how sweaty they are.
---
The only thing I've noticed that OP mentioned is that Frostbolt seems to replace my crippling poison slow.. so if the mob starts running and the mage has switched targets its a crapshoot if I can get crippling back on them before they get to the next pack.
---
Pagle-Horde!? You do exist!
---
What a magical time it was!
---
Good lord those names are so white I'm literally going blind from the glow.
---
&gt; No, very possible. If you're holy spec with decent gear, you could probably heal all the way through emperor (assuming your tank is good and at least lvl 55-56).
---
I tanked this yesterday at level 55 on my warrior with a level 54 priest and it was cake.  I think the only hard part was a bad pull where we got two fire elementals on top of another pack.
---
It does though, in an indirect way. If you have 6k people, one layer isn’t enough to handle that without nodes being non-existent, or hue lag and competition. While it’s in a 2 layer state, the population is larger than it will be with one layer. So I reckon it will be a perfect storm of people renewing subs, and also removal of layering, and queues/transfers to deal with it.
---
Pls Blizzard, let excess Alli on arugal transfer to Skeram.
---
Nah it’s gurubashi, every man for himself. The mistake was trusting some random pug.
---
yes my guild except 4 or 5 pickups, dont be salty lol
---
It is absolutely possible. There are several macros floating around out there that will let you buy all the limited quantity items all at once. If that orc had lower latency than you, then he bought all of them instantly.
---
I’ve been 60 since early week 3, have almost full raid tank gear, full preraid bis dps gear, and every time I log on I have something I’m doing from the second I’m active until I decide to log off. 
---
Helping guildies, farming gold, leveling alts, prep for phase 2/3. There are numerous things for me to do. 
---
If you’re bored that’s your own fault, not the games.
---
Your experience is way different than mine. Mages are always in demand as they have buff/food, great aoe dps and single target dps, and what I like the most, good mages control the crowd, you can grab mobs from healer and bring everyone to tank, then nova. Mobs are always slow, they don't run to another group. But I guess some mages are not really good.
---
Yet you’re taking time to send comments my way. Too cool for school aren’t ya kiddo?
---
Just curious, I am sure that they are eagle not gyphons. And Lotr eagles are so powerful that also are responsible to wipe out most dragon.
---
Dwarf paladins are known cannibals. It’s a problem and we’re trying to fix it
---
I don't care
---
Sorry I ruined this price gouge gold trick for you :)
---
Exactly. Hit 120 today in retail in dungeon blues as a warrior and just try taking even a cloth wearer below 90% health. You won’t be able to.
---
Oh, yeah, absolutely. But he mentioned the two classes (rogue and warrior) any good mage will just destroy in BGs.
---
Shadow priests can ruin a mages day, so can warlocks. Although, to be fair, shadow priests can ruin everyone's day. ;)
---
&gt; You needed the group to see the drop.
---
This is true for every single thing in every dungeon, and every quest that involves a dungeon. Thus, by your logic, the group should be divvying up BoP's evenly, I should be rolling on every BoP, BoE, whites and grays should be rolled for too.
---
Furthermore quest rewards should all be vendored no matter what so we can evenly split up the gold from vendoring them.
---
Great logic homie.
---
If gurubashi arena event was not a chest but a mob has to get tagged and killed, nobody would ninja that items even if that arena was FFA.
---
Who said majordomo chest has rules? In a raid, raid leader sets the rules. It's up to you to obey him. In that arena, raid leader set a rule that blue will loot the chest. You can ninja the gurubashi chest like you can ninja the majordomo chest.
---
Game mechanics allows you to open chests in a dungeon even if there's master looter on. Just because arena has "FFA PVP" tag, it doesn't mean you can do anything you want to your group members. It's rude. If you are going to play solo, go play solo.
---
Ohh... :( 
---
I was thinking there's a certain interval of time between buying two different things from a vendors.
---
That's racist
---
Was doing rogue/druid runs and getting roughly 25g from vendoring stuff per run, if you count the mana pots you're looking at 30g per run and you can hit the instance lockout.
---
Many servers have already had layers removed and are locked to single layer.
---
Any server that still has Layers, will also get locked to single layer as phase 2 rolls out at the latest.
---
Be prepared, for wailing and gnashing of teeth, as those "huge servers" now have all those extra layers added to their queues.
---
I've been debating on starting a rogue and leveling up Alchemy/Herb as I play for the buffs.
---
Would it be a better idea to herb/skin as I level for the coin vs potions for leveling ease?
---
Is there an item/scroll that gives you a lightning shield like a shaman? 
---
Last night I was ambushing a priest on the road and right as I opened he used a spell or something that gave him a shaman's lightning shield and it threw me off, thinking I may have not seen the class until I was feared with Shadow Word: Pain on me. I am 100% sure I only had one Horde enemy to fight.
---
But you do, you care enough to not only open up my post, but also to write a reply.
---
If you truly didn't care, you'd just ignore it ;)

And you’re trying to convince you me you have a life outside of this game? Do you consider going through Reddit accounts comment history to get triggered your extra curricular activity?
---
Go get some tendies, your mom misses you.
---
It's quite a long wait for P3.
---
If you only play for raids not much would change for you with BWL right? Just a different raid to do once a week like you are doing with MC/Only right now.
---
Sorry for jumping to conclusions.
---
You will not because around and after lvl 53-54 you will be most of your time in dungeon. Or if you can't because not the time hum... Root + Cheetas can be a great macro to do
---
Try TSM (TradeSkillMaster).
---
That interface :x
---
Am I supposed to give MotW to every mage that gives me the Arcane buff without asking?
---
I rememeber at least in EU when they brought out pvp rewards we had huge amounts of people rolling on to PVE servers.
---
Usually, but we were running with a small crew that evening.
---
The funniest experience I've had so far has been four guildies looking for a tank. I think we were a dps pally, rogue, mage, priest. Looked and looked for like 30 minutes and finally the pally is like "fuck it I'll tank, it's 30g to respec but it beats waiting". So he goes and respecs, LF1M DPS BRD Arena/Anger, flooded with DPS warrior tells immediately... ended up with a 60 dps warrior that's just gonna end up tanking because he's outdpsing the Pally.. I just don't get it.
---
They get thorns.
---
Yea it would be true if u put 6k people in one zone, but if they are all over the world it wont affect ur ping that much, but who knows maybe I’m just wrong.
---
Wow! Seeing this item is even more shocking than those rolls.
---
Lol flexing e-peen? Are you 12 years old? I asked a question and you react like I came in here bragging linking my characters gear and stats like I'm some bad ass. Molten Core is a small raid, 12 bosses with minimal tactics per boss. I ASKED if there is anyone raiding MC on multiple days because to me it seems like a one sitting type of job.
---
I understand, haven't read up on the best pieces for each set yet. Makes sense. 😄
---
It's not about level 60 though, serious ranking players will catch and kill you regardless of your level. But then you can team up with friends and maybe kill them as well. Thats the essence of pvp servers.
---
This will only be an issue during p2. In p3 pvpers will get battlegrounds and all going to be quite again.
---
Troll's racial ability is shadowguard, which looks just like lightning shield and works the same way but it's shadow damage.
---
Its definitely a completely different playstyle than deep prot, and I would say that keeping threat as deep prot is far easier than as fury/prot. You also seem to have a lot of tricks to keeping aoe threat, so you don't need to worry about that.
---
So here's some small facts about Fury/Prot to help you out:
---
-Your burst threat is lower (no shield slam) but your overall single-target threat is higher (flurry allows for more rage generation, and bloodthirst hits fairly hard, especially with raid buffs).
---
-You swap between dual wielding and using a shield often, and you are in defensive stance almost exclusively. If you're healer is struggling, keep the shield on. You'll still get more rage than deep prot.
---
-Furyprot is VERY gear dependent. The reason I can generate so much threat is that I have 6% hit (human) and 22% crit, unbuffed, in defensive stance. This enables around 80% flurry uptime, even with a 1 hander, giving me the rage I need to use bloodthirst on cooldown, which is what brings our threat above deep prot.
---
-Yes, you lose out on a lot of utility. Not having Tactical Mastery sucks. Sucks real bad. But as you practice fury/prot, you learn to work around its limitations. Keep bloodrage ready in case of the need to swap for a mocking blow or intercept.
---
-For aoe threat, honestly, tab sunder/revenge is extremely effective, more so than whirlwind, since the extra threat while in defensive stance. And with all the rage you get with fury/prot (especially while dual wielding) you can use sunder every gcd and still have rage for bloodthirst when it comes off cooldown.
---
-Finally, the biggest reason why fury/prot is awesome: when you lose threat. As deep prot, if you lose threat, you have your taunt, but if its resisted, or there's more than one mob, you start to run into rage starvation issues to get and keep threat back on all those mobs. As furyprot, you just swap to dual wielding (since you're not currently being attacked) and keep attacking, and you'll find you have plenty of rage to spam sunders and bloodthirst, and even the occasional cleave. With that, you'll be able to get threat back even without taunt. Its that extra rage, even when not being struck, that makes furyprot amazing.
---
Is that the lionheart helm or just a random shit green?
---
The mount is so, so good. Your head is in the right place. For almost any other piece of gear I also would have said he should get the mount. It’s just that specific helmet is so good.
---
This.   Leatrix has so many quality of life functions.    Auto invite accept from friends list people.   Auto accept rez.   Auto sell junk.   Auto Repair.   Block trade / duel.
---
Except almost every 18x goes back to 11b so i dont get your point
---
Didnt blizzard say that Ninjaing is a player issue, and they wont take action against them? Also what happens in the arena stays in the arena.
---
I imagine later in in AQ when mages go fire it's annoying to respec if you want to pvp
---
My dude I can give you some advice from my days as a balls-to-the-wall about progression mage back in Vanilla. 
---
Raid spots in guilds like that are ridiculous competitive. I'm talking I had an easier time getting a university acceptance letter than I did getting a raid spot when I first joined. 
---
I spent *days* /played in front of MC and BWL with 80 slots of water pre-made for everyone that was raiding. I'd wait there and hand it to anyone in my guild that came through. Keep in mind *I was not in the raid.* 
---
But, one night, finally, 2 mages were sick and couldn't attend. The usual alternate was called up and then they realized they didn't have a second. Guess whose name came to *everyone's* mind? Mine. Then, because they were already late, they wanted to add a mage from a different guild that was friends with our guild leader. I quickly chimed in that I was right in front of the instance still and that he was in Stormwind and this would be faster. I got my invite and, because I had all the BiS gear prior, they let me come again next week and the rest is history. 
---
This is *is a job* at that level. Period.
---
I use aux
---
You dont really need any gear, but I would recommend around prebis, you need 200 engi for the door, or 200 blacksmith I guess for truesilver key should also work
---
Rightklick the player
---
Again, this is demonstrably false. If you didn't care, you wouldn't respond. So you do care, at least enough to spend time writing a response.
---
SO MANY FUCKING CAREBEARS UP IN HERE
---
I'll concede absolute shit was a big exaggeration. However I find it performs noticeably worse from my experience with it.  As you said with us being constantly sniped I'll take any advantage I can get. In our raid we have a feral tank already so I'm not worried about having to OT. I did run hotw while gearing up prebis but found getting healer gear a bit of a pain as the group healer usually doesn't like them rolling against them. Just been my experiences so far. Mileage may vary.
---
Did you get it to work with the spell name/id? My work around was to just trigger when my Crit % is greater than 100%.
---
Or ya know shit isn’t cut and dry and those 3 actually needed the item and the dude who just wanted to sell it for gold didn’t.
---
Mirah's song is a great offhand, and the Dal Rend set in UBRS is really great.
---
Lvled my warrior to 45, started mage. Mage in prebis with loads of money, warrior dinged 55 yesterday.
---
Gurubashi Arena spawns a chest and everyone in the arena becomes an enemy until its looted.
---
Not if you reroll to a PvE server.  :p
---
He’s physically attacking it solo.  Of course he’d have buffs. You read the title, the first thing you think is “What buffs does he have???” It’s so obvious, you’d have to assume it.
---
The first half of your title had me like "hold up..."
---
As someone that love tanking but without guild when first started.
---
You should start joining different pug mc, a lot of  these MC will eventually morph into a real raid guild, especially one that do well each week. This is how I meet my current guild. You could also see who run raid and feel certain expectations of loot rule and guild environment. 
---
Good luck on your adventures.
---
Is it me or are the quests in STV awful?  Kill 50 raptors only to get another mission asking to panthers and then tigers!  Loved questing in the Barrens and in Kalimdor in general but  I swear to god those damn troll necklaces will be the end of me.
---
Wait, so even other alliance become red? That’s cool, what loot does it drop?
---
Easy as cake
---
If you can usually win fights against level ?? ganks, against multiple people around your level, or when you're at 50% HP and currently fighting a quest mob, more power to you.
---
Go tank then. Gearing as tank is pretty fun because you have make your gear the perfect mix of threat/mitigation. Ofc in the beginning you'll be focused more towards mitigation, but later moving towards threat. I'm constantly changing my bis list, yes one I made myself, to whichever gear I feel like would give my current build the best upgrade. I've looked over a ton of warrior bis tanking list and very few do I feel like are good, because they rarely show a threat alternative to the mitigation piece being listed.
---
Fuck those people, you're doing what's right even if it costs you. You know how many books have been written about people like you?
---
Yeah he ninja the chest and they let him do it.
---
And it's like raiding with group loot. They let people ninja items.
---
There is no difference. You let people ninja items. They let him open the chest = they let people roll need on any item.
---
I use +healing blues when healing raids and dungeons, and the prophecy set when soloing or when assigned to dispelling.
---
(Vambraces of Prophecy is good.)
---
pvping on a pvp server = camping to feel better
---
I mean, you can forget it, right until the boss turns around and one-shots you.
---
Why did you add /s to a non-sarcastic comment?
---
Doesn't change the fact that Mage is the easiest to level, being able to conjure food/water and do aoe pulls easily. I can't even fight 3 mobs as a warlock without using fear, though that usually just brings even more mobs
---
Yeah, i know, thanks for the warning
---
Likely Shadowlabs
---
Few questions as a shadow priest I seen lower ranked swp already mentioned but also you dont have spirit tap I guess that's for pvpers using blackout or whatever it's called instead and this last one is just wondering is your number 1 still set to staff bash looks like staff attack icon.
---
1 Disappointed DPS, ah
---
2 Disappointed DPS, ah ah
---
I rolled priest so i could be a dwarf.  Didnt feel like leveling a pally, didnt want to tank (warrior) and didnt feel like being melee dps (rogue).
---
I’m doing my first MC raid tonight on my lock. Any general advice on what I should bring and look out for? Cheers
---
Whats the addon called?
---
I think a good portion of people have been talking about how much harder it'll be.
---
So? That's never stopped anyone from doing it in the past. My server isn't even that full compared to the others but we still have the occasional 60 horde in redridge one-shotting lowbies.
---
And that would be fine, if world PvP being the only way to get honor didn't change the way people interact. 
---
It's pretty hard to ignore raids of people camping you.
---
Yeah absolutly. Burn every CD you got. But dont do it before the tank has even had time to charge ^^
---
Okay so idk your personal experience or if you play a healer, but I have a Druid alt at 60 now and 50/50 heal/tank dungeons while levelling. 
---
If the tank is moderately geared and not a pepeg, then in hardly downing mana food as often as you suggest. When everything is going fine it’s very easy to let your mp5 tick.
---
Warlocks on the other hand fully burn their mana on every pull, even the small ones, that’s just how their class work from what I see.
---
He would have trouble equipping the lionheart helm at lvl 32
---
You could go into MC or Ony and be fine. Work on some fire resistance for Ragnaros, and keep running dungeons for upgrades in the meantime.
---
100% researched, 20% documented, and some of the documentation is wrong.
---
You could definitely go in as a OT. For most guilds, they’d expect the MT to be in full pre-BiS just to making healing a little easier.
---
That being said, I’m pretty sure the world first guilds did it in greens.
---
Warrior say what
---
they're not requiring it, i felt like i needed the 5% crit because i was running out of mana faster than i should be
---
holy shock was just for pvp shenanigans
---
&gt;Couple times a week? Is anyone actually progressing MC on multiple days?
---
Is this a real question? People level and gear up in waves based on the amount of free time they have to play video games. Some of my friends have almost all BiS gear from phase 1, while others have yet to reach 60. And some people just hitting 60 and starting MC soon will probably do it over the course of a couple nights.
---
My guild actually needs more.  We have 2 humans, a nelf, and 2 dwarves....but the other dwarf is shadow (which sucks for fear warding).  Ive been on Fear Ward bitch duty for the past few weeks lol
---
Yeah the troll necklaces are horrible, but they were worse on private servers so it wasn't too bad.  I rotate out of STV a lot so I don't go crazy in that bracket.
---
We are talking about people wanting to roll a pve server and getting mountains of shit for it
---
Hahahahahhahahaha
---
That's like the most ultimate betrayal I've ever heard of.
---
Make an alt that farms for you. Hunter/Mage.
---
I had similar gear when I was main-tanking our first MC run and our guild managed to clear all the way to golemagg on our first attempt.
---
You'll want to start building up your fire resist set for ragnaros though.
---
A warrior would give their left nut for thunderclap in defensive stance right now. Their aoe threat is such garbage, it’s silly. So much more effort to keep mobs on you, while bears mash their forehead on the keyboard.
---
I had the same problem it's a one click change in the options. If you haven't figured it out yet let me know then I will check when I'm on my computer
---
Most classes T1 have issues. T1 are very stat heavy and their design predates the addition of a large amount of +spell damage gear into the game. Even though we're still in P1, Blizz added a ton of spell damage into the game simply by reitemizing existing items, so there's a lot of late-stage OP vanilla gear that's still here in P1.
---
The other problem is like you say, fights are shorter than they were due to various class buffs, mechanical buffs, and greater player knowledge of the game, making the high stat T1 gear even more lackluster. 
---
The sad reality is that early vanilla raiding really does lack a clear progression of gear and would have needed a major itemization overhaul to get. HOWEVER, don't despair. Those extra stats on your tier gear are awesome in pvp, strong solo, and on the occasional fight where it's more important to stay alive than do maximal damage (think Nefarian, or even Razergore where you don't need the stats so much as you need to not die to the occasional orc caster's AE) you can mix in T1 with that dungeon gear to hit the right balance between survivability, endurance, and +healing.
---
If you can't see the difference between the two...
---
And that takes hour to be delivered.
---
The biggest amount of gold comes from selling items to players. A decent time per run is 20 minutes total(including running back out before resetting). From vendor items+selling pots on AH gold per run is about 30g. So without selling gear to players you would get 90gph. If you manage to sell items every run each run you get 30g+30g but it takes at least 30 min per run depending on how far the buyer has to travel. That is total of 120gph. But in reality you will die every now and then to FD resist or mistakes and gph will vary a lot.
---
Well yeah, it's a well-known fact Vanilla Azeroth wasn't designed with the current amount of players allowed per realm in mind.
---
That's a big oof
---
If you’re not first, you’re last.
---
Hmm no tranq shot might get pretty crazy
---
Is that a JoJo reference?
---
Nope. 1 bar per 8 hours, capping at 30 bars. 8*30=240 hours=10days
---
At work atm and don't remember! Will try to remember to check &amp; get back to you later :)
---
Sure? That's the game. I don't get angry when I get camped anymore than I get angry if I get shot in CoD. Take revenge or find so done who can. That's the fun.
---
Dont forget wisp form :P
---
The raid frames towards the bottom. Is that your healing add on? I like the way it looks. I'm addicted to Healbot, but the raid options are lacking
---
The camping where will be where your own faction 60s roll in to counter gank. Right now there is low incentive to help outside of the goodness of ones heart. It works both ways.
---
I bet he's the kinda guy to type "LFM Healers UBRS, Reed reserved" on LFG
---
looks like you didn't raid much in classic. Perhaps you are too young for that, my retail friend.
---
 Warlock dps was very threat capped early on. Besides not being able to use dots in raids due to the 8 debuff limit, we also had to tone down our dps to not steal agro, both in dungeons and raids. Untill ruins of ankh qiraj it was a pretty shitty class to raid with.
---
*Laughs in tranquil air totem*
---
Yeah fair point, I messed up.
---
Still nothing.
---
You will get shredded trying to 2h arms tank in Scholo, Strat, and DM.  Put on a shield and learn to tab-sunder.
---
Interest ya in a pint?
---
Most likely just ran out. Happened to a guild tank of mine the other day. He ended up body pulling the rest of the dungeon. Still worked out but had a few pulls that had additional unwanted packs.
---
&gt;  in my experience from vanilla, maybe 1 in 10 pvp encounters can even be described as borderline fair
---
Yeah, this is what gets me about the people in love with world pvp. It's almost *always* an unfair fight. Nobody engages otherwise. It's very, very difficult to 1v2 competent players, or even 1v3 shitty players.
---
I've never won a pvp fight since classic started lol. I'm a holy priest, so my options are to . . . heal them to death? People only engage if they're higher level or outnumber us, too.
---
*Colleagues hate him*
---
I'd rank LBRS higher, if just for the spellcasters' counterspell which locks your holy school for 16(!) seconds.
---
Made me laugh pretty hard. Thanks!
---
I don't get this at all. I play with 3 pals and if we don't need the help, we 4 man content. If we can't 4 man it, then the extra people are essential to even getting a shot at the loot.
---
RWTed??
---
You could skip STV, I entirely skipped the area myself. STV is not very interesting and usually not linked to dungeon
---
The spec isn’t the issue, it’s the players. Many are lazy, selfish, or giant pussies.
---
Maybe even less actually, since time spent camping grays is time lost camping greens that yield honor. So you'll have the people that don't give a shit about honor do it, but they do it now too, however you'll probably have less of the people that do care about honor do it. So unless you are level 51+ it could actually be a better experience, unless you happen to get caught up in some wPvP. Stumbling in on a big gank party might be a higher risk, however they'll probably not go out of their way to corpse camp someone that doesn't yield any honor to them.
---
And you end at top 30 dps, lmao
---
Grob is home! :)
---
I mean, I lose almost every fight where someone gets the jump on me. Nobody attacks me 1v1 when I'm at full hp/mana. They wait until I'm grinding mobs and low on mana.
---
Boomer isn't an age, its a mindset
---
It’s not like I let him, I didn’t know you could attack people in your own raid group/none of us are veteran players by any means so didn’t think to kick+kill in time. 
---
oh well, I hope people don’t think I’m upset by being taken advantage of for about 1g lol, just wanted some insight being a newer player.
---
Can the mana surge effect trigger multiple times in one cast? Or does it simply have three opportunities to proc now that it bounces?
---
Yes, that won't oom a shaman at all
---
DME Jump Runs with a healer
---
If I had to guess it would be battlegrounds. Phase 2 is mostly for world PvP, which some enjoy and other don't. Phase 3 starts to get into some very long lasting content, with BWL/Darkmoone Faire/Battlegrounds being introduced.
---
40-mage
---
Put off your gear and kill al low lvl bots when you are there. :)
---
To be honest, I don't know how to do that, so this would all be a fun, silly, mystery to me.
---
Sometimes, ignorance truly is bliss.
---
Nope not for allies
---
Can't agree more.  People be like "oh you can aoe with 2 buttons and make tons of money". Well I needed a lot of practice to get aoe going without wipes.  Even now, knowing how it works I still learn how to not panic when things got resisted. I do CoC aoe not blizzard, way easier.
---
Completely disagree. 4-6 hours per day means I would have to spend about all my free time out of work during the week on the game. That’s not casual, you’re a pretty dedicated player at this point. Hardcore players, in my opinion, are the ones that spend 8+ hours per day playing the game.
---
When I think of casual I think of someone who spends 2-3 hours at a time 3-4 times per week playing the game. Everyone’s ranges of casual differs but when you’re spending 28-42 hours per week (per your definition) playing a game I think most people wouldn’t classify that as casual. Efficacy has nothing to do with the definition. You’re either playing the game and dedicating the time or you’re not.
---
I've yet to see a decent dps warrior. If I join a group and see a warrior tank and a dps warrior I usually backout before it starts.
---
On a fight like ony where the melee can do white damage only in p1, wf is shit
---
Zero?
---
This. I am the opposite of OP I got talked into joining a PvE server but if you think about it playing on PvE server with PvP enabled is the same as playing on a PvP server. Especially if you're the type to never start fights. The only difference is you can tell if the person who ganked you is a coward or not.
---
Also depending on the boss, they might turn around and cast a debuff on some random player for a moment. If you only had two parries, that sound like it could be the reason.
---
They most define fly offered transfers from high pop to lower or medium pop realms people chose to stick to their starting server any discomfort felt is their own making.
---
STV sucks. Hard. Especially if you're alliance.
---
&gt; I didn't mean the insult I followed it with an "xD"
---
life doesn't work that way, my man ;P
---
Some people just fail to consider others being there for their own gain, rather than just helping them. Might not even be malice, just a combination of not thinking it through + a bit of tunnel vision on your own goal.
---
The kill quests are great, you go to where they're supposed to be and kill them, easy exp. The bone necklace quest however is terrible. I grinded almost an entire level yesterday doing that quest. It's so RNG dependent. I got to 20 relatively quickly, then partied up with a couple people and saw 0 in 25 minutes. Then left the party and it took me another 20 minutes to finish the last 5.  
---
Adversely on my warrior I don't remember it being that bad at all and I got done all of the troll quests around the same time.
---
Overall I enjoy STV, at least Northern STV. Southern STV can get annoying with the pirate ship stuff and Gorilla stuff. If you can find a group for them its not bad though.
---
Thanks captain.
---
It all comes down to personal preference.  I actually like the mindless kill quests - the ones that don't involve drops.  You just go and kill stuff and get good XP.  Only thing better than that is the single named mob kill quests.
---
My grandparents aren't near that age and I'm almost 30. The grandparent could have easily been ~45 in 2007. And I imagine we have a lot of people that age here now.
---
It took exactly 2 seconds to look at your post history and completely destroy your self esteem lol. Look how mad you are that I clicked on your name over 24 hours later. Maybe stop being a reddit NEET and you'll feel better about yourself man. Good luck with that.
---
Maybe because this is the r/classicwow sub and not the r/wow
---
The way I did it was I leveled herbalism/skinning then switch skinning to alchemy at level 50 something when I had enough gold to powerlevel alchemy from 0-300 in one go.  I'll be honest though, unless you get flask recipes Alchemy doesn't make too much money.  TSM values a lot of the potions at a negative profit, i.e. the mats cost more than the potion on the AH which also means it's just better off to sell raw materials.  
---
The obvious exception is Fire Protection potions.  I can make around 30 silver on each potion.  Though, a better use of a small flame sac is in the dragonbreath food.  That sells worse, but it has a lot more profit potential.
---
if you get less threat as fury prot you're doing something wrong, with the right gear and spec and playstyle you dish out waaay more TPS than typical prot, theres a reason why people are going fury prot.
---
all about gandling brah
---
Honestly 50 to 60 have been the nicest levels and feel fast although they have been like 6-8 hours per level. I stuck to questing green zones which made them enjoyable.
---
Yes, you do

Any suggestions for changes?
---
This is a very good point and I'll consider rolling for some of the priest t1 gear for this exact reason. It's not necessary now but as you say it might help tremendously in later phases, both for PvP and certain fights.
---
Great thanks.
---
The amount of hate, vitriol, and sexual like pleasure I hear from people pvping now is absurd, it's going to be bad in phase 2. Honestly as my guilds MT I have no interest as PvPing as prot, I have no intentions of PvPing in classic, just takes way too much time to get the things that are worth it. I'll be staying comfy in my city walls.
---
Hey, you're not OP. You're a phony!
---
I am indeed PvP spec with no spirit tap. 1 key is wand.
---
You know that basically neuters the shamans mana yea?
---
It's ok. But he's insisting it's not same with letting people ninja items in PVE. Accidentally or not, you let him loot the chest. Happens sometimes. You might forget loot rules in group and kill onyxia too. Same thing.
---
You had a chance to attack him, but you didn't. He ninjad.
---
You had a chance to fix group loot but you didn't. They ninjad.
---
They seem bad, but you gotta remember most of your xp is coming from killing mobs, the xp reward from quests is just icing on the cake. It's a very good zone xp wise as long as you aren't having your time be wasted by getting ganked every 5 minutes, then in that case you should just leave until you're a higher level.

For more info you can message me through discord (Pwlocke #7260) or look in-game for: Bahnzo, Gallar, Resented, FreshPrintz, Chuhee, or Zab

Level-based hit calculations are super relaxed for pvp combat. As a level 48, you have a decent chance of landing spells/hits on a level 60 player - far, far more than a level 60 mob.
---
Level 60s already get much, much reduced honor for level 48s. IIRC it's the same formula as for XP.
---
There's also diminishing returns on killing the same player multiple times. I think after like 3 times you don't get any more honor for the day, but I could be wrong on the specifics.
---
That being said, we already have level 60s going around murdering people in stv, without honor in the game, and I doubt that's going to change.
---
So I have a qustion about what weapons to use. I am a sublety/Assassination Rogue and am basically collecting Swords at this point.   
---
The Weapons I own are: Bloodrazor, Assasination Blade, Thrash Blade, Mirahs Song and Cho´ Rushs Blade.   
---
Any Advice on what Combination of those I should use would be greatly appreaciated.
---
I've done this before. A warlock was safe sniping people from the back of the room, including me. So I said fuck it, if I can't he can't. I killed the vendor several times before I left.
---
I pretty much only do dungeons with the same group of homies.
---
I've not been in an actual pug with my priest for more than a month, and that was just to farm the first 3 of lbrs for skyshroud.
---
Argument is alliance have it easier by nearly 75%. Because shamans, which requires ability, can twist but paladins just derp blessings. Salv is default
---
bds set?
---
Whorde
---
are we ignoring tremor totem?
---
Uldaman I think has a good bit of mithril, also has some other weird ore that I don't remember the name of but should still give you skill points.
---
with 0 honor in game, trying to farm tusks for WW axe on my 32 warrior a 39 mage hung around the area and killed me like 7 times. Wasn't there for any reason I could discern. Wasn't killing any mobs. Just ganking lower level alliance. People don't really need a reason, some people just enjoy killing.
---
You have to be raid lead or assist, barring that you have an add-on screwing things up.
---
Tell that to half the tanks I've healed recently :)
---
At least one leather war put on a shield towards the end of undead strat.
---
At that point I’d stop worrying about leveling and start aiming for pre-BiS and mount gold. You will hit 60 eventually just from doing your farming and dungeons. I hit 60 with about half my pre-bis, and most of my mount gold banked. Grinding for 60 is pretty useless when you can do all endgame dungeons at level 57-58.
---
Simply check shadowpanther.net which has the highest rating
---
&gt; then partied up with a couple people and saw 0 in 25 minutes.
---
It looks like drop mechanic is changed in party.  
---
In party of 5 people - only 2-3 would be getting quest drops. Rest would be getting zero. But as soon as this 2-3 get all quest items, rest would also start to get them.
---
I've seen plenty of other mages acting a fool with frost nova and blizzard, but hunters are still pretty bad. I stopped wasting time with casting polymorph if a hunter is in the group. It always ends up getting hit with multi shot 2 seconds after I cast poly. I see much less idiocy with pets though for the most part.
---
IDK what you were expecting. You roll warrior to be "the" tank. You level casually. You join a guild that's way ahead of your progress and are now mad that they don't let you tank? Literally everyone knew that raid tanking for a good guild takes some SERIOUS dedication which you don't seem to have. You're behind their progression while everyone knows that the few tanks in a 40 man group are expected to be geared to their teeth.
---
Tanking doesn't "suck". It can be very fun. You just had no idea what you're getting into. Anyways, have fun with RD2.

&gt;  If you're running UBRS and bring a group of 15
---
People run UBRS with 15? Why?
---
On Herod alliance
---
Loving it
---
Bought a krol blade after 80 UBRS and I never even saw the MH. Luckily got my TS though.
---
Yeah I normally run dungeons with guild. I still have +500 healing in my heal set so I will heal for dps when needed.
---
Flasks must be EXPENSIVE with that many people on your server.
---
Black Lotus alone is probably well over 100 gold.
---
"Healthy" my ass, that's excessive (I know the other guy said it but I'm replying to you after reading his).
---
I don't know how I feel about server populations existing with this many people and not having ways to compensate for that. Not layering, but resource-wise. I'm thinking how I've never even seen Black Lotus on my server, and how it is currently 60g+ per pick. Maybe respawn areas need to be added or the speed of respawns need to be increased? I'm still unsure if that is even prudent to think about, but seeing servers somehow worse off in terms of overpopulation than mine makes me think this isn't an accurate representation of Vanilla.
---
Key point is, you give him an opportunity to ninja items by not attacking him. Not looting a chest vs looting a mob.
---
Truestrike shoulders are like Dinkleberg's to me.
---
TRUESTRIKE SHOULDERS!!!!! Damn you!
---
Grind lower level mobs. One of my favorite places to farm was doing loops around un'goro. This is the level range for a few choice epic drops (Edgemaster's, Freezing Band, Warden Staff) off the very easy to grind dinosaurs, which also drop pretty decent saleable greys. There's a variety of rich thorium mines, but not so many that the dedicated miners are there, as they are more likely to be in WS, BS or EPL. You can swing by the volcano to farm elemental fires, and if you have a skinner friend who logs on you might even be able to get at Devilsaurs. 
---
I'd also considering dual lifestealer enchants. I ran that as an experiment and was shocked by the sustain I was able to get with the healing generated from both enchants and BT.
---
Take a break.  Mow the lawn.  Your bathroom is filthy.  Call Mom.
---
This is 90% of the PvP population.
---
Best players in the guild are made officers -&gt; officers got loot first -&gt; babbies cry, gquit, and complain on reddit  
---
Is it every time or just most of the time?
---
I think I'm doing it wrong. Try farming there as a warrior and I found it to be really slow.
---
I'm assuming the person you're replying to is claiming it's "9 min per run" from entry to boss death and doesn't consider the run back out, resetting, vendoring etc. Even then, consistent 9-min runs aren't possible with current gear levels, so he's talking out of his arse.
---
If Alliance had it easier by 75%, there would be 0-2 Horde guild among the top 50.
---
Shamans have to boohoo twist and get WF on the other hand. Overall, Alliance have it a tiny bit easier.
---
&gt; As a priest, am I the only one feeling like the prophecy set is really lackluster?
---
Lol, did you see Druid T1? With mix of every stat it looks like Blizz could not understand what to do with Druids.
---
This is why Hunters go engineering.
---
what makes you say that when classic hasn't been here for a decade and nothing competed with wow yet?
---
tbc is the better solution

BÄM

Real world trading.
---
Whenever you have a choice between an objective system or a subjective system I choose the objective. 
---
Just because you failed grade 7 math dosnt mean dkp or EP/gp are bad.
---
Well, I find the idea of forfeiting your enjoyment of the game just to play with some friends who can't get the fact that I can't stand non-consenting pvp ridiculous.
---
But to each their own. If you can tolerate pvp just to be with your friends, more power to you.
---
no, not fuck those people, those people arent idiots, 60g is 60g value to all, if you dont need on valuable BOE's ur just dumb
---
No. Instance cap is instance cap. So either way if he is doing 9 min runs he will have to wait.
---
Thank you
---
run
---
Blizzcon 2019 reminded me why i love Classic.
---
Someone please do the math on this. How much HPS could you pump into a tank with 40 recombobulators?
---
But I'm not talking about spec,  I'm just stating what people like. There isn't 20% players who like to tank (therefore hard to find tank for dungeons) but there's more than 5% of people who likes to tank (therefore it's hard to find a tank spot in raid)
---
And basically that's what BC fixed: you needed 2-3 tanks for 25 and with druid and paladin tanking (because of stuff and real talents) you have a much bigger pool of players who were able to tank just as well as warrior for dungeons.
---
Racist
---
That was it! Thanks. Had me bamboozled for a second, then when I came to a bear came to my rescue in Hillsbrad haha
---
LBRS 1h?! No damn way, a full LBRS clear is almost more epic than a full BRD clear. LBRS is highly variable depending on what bosses you chose to run. 1h maybe if you're just doing Omok/Vosh farming, or 1hour if you do the drop and head straight up to Wyrmthalak, but a full clear, I'd say most likely 2hrs given a gear-appropriate group, and that's assuming people are bringing their A-game.
---
Do you want to pvp or not?
---
What's different?
---
No I didn't, I said the run was hell, and strongly implied that what should have been a 70-minute cake walk turned into a 3-hour slog (most probably due to lengthy pack clears due to 1 or 2 dps killing themselves on the pull, the healers blowing all their mana futilely trying to keep the aforementioned morons alive, then having to waste more time res-ing tweedle-dumb and tweedle-dumber after each pull).
---
Try some reading comprehension before commenting next time please.
---
Ok. Let’s do a little thought experiment, because there is a mental misfire going on here with this conversation.
---
I have 2 hours to play this game every other day. And when I started, the server was balanced, atleast to a bearable point. The first 35-40 levels was very tolerable. Ok? Let’s call that “the average pvp server experience”
---
Then, Blizzard allows character migrations for both factions from select servers, and throws EVERYTHING out of whack. Why would the horde leave in droves?
---
The alliance, feeling like they just don’t have quite the advantage all turn tail. So there’s the “terrible player experience”
---
You see? This situation wasn’t organic. It was manufactured. I would have just sucked it up and refilled if they never did transfers because I know that transfers weren’t an option in vanilla, so it wouldn’t be a thing for us. 
---
That’s my issue, and it can still be fixed! Am I complaining? Yes absolutely, but there’s hope! Funneling transfers to the massively underrepresented servers on a faction based system would help TREMENDOUSLY and I don’t have to spend 3 months slowly grinding back up to 60 on a different server.
---
Indurium I think is the Name
---
I've found the tanks to be the problem with going fast tbh. I'm DPS so a normal dungeon has a tank and 2 other DPS. I almost never hear the DPS or healer suggesting to skip. The tank always starts giving instructions on how to skip this next pack at which point it doesn't matter and we fight it anyway because his instructions only work for a level 60 and this 53 can't just sneak into Arena in BRD without fighting anything. It honestly drives me fucking insane. I've easily spent 6 hours in this game corpse running after dying to a trash pack skip. The worst was this tank where we fucking wiped twice in a row because he wanted to sneak by the pat. It's a 45 second pack. Just fucking murder it you toolbag. /rant
---
Go alch, it's just fun, and that endless stack of healing pots will be a huge help avoiding deaths and having to do corpse runs.
---
Farming and warrior in the same sentence. I think I have found your problem lol. As a general rule if your class is a slow leveler you are generally a pretty slow farmer. Pala and warr have it rough.
---
That guy who gets camped the entire 2 hours he has in an evening to play isn't having fun, bud. He's transferring off that server or letting his sub run out. This has already been happening for over a month across pretty much all the PvP realms.
---
I'm on a PvE realm, none of this matters to me in the slightest, I just think its funny how people defend to the grave their right to ruin other's game-time to the point of tanking entire realms. Those 80-20 realms will hit 100-0 in days after Phase 2.
---
I'm the problem tho. On my PvE realm, I'm the problem. Just lol.
---
This fight is pretty dependant on your dps. The dwarf adds he spawns need to be quickly killed by your dps, you don't really need to tank them, they should die very fast. Adds are top priority in this fight, so make sure all dps kill them and no one still attacks the boss triggering the next wave while there are still adds running around.
---
Only when those 2 golems get activated, everyone just bursts the boss and you as tank try to keep them on you (or a hunter pet off tanks one etc.). This is the moment for cooldowns if available.
---
This is no fight where you just slowly whittle away at the boss until it finally dies of boredom, your dps need to do their job, so all need to be of an adequate level.
---
Hate to say it but I was very found of popular anime (sao/aot/any rpg-alternate-reality thing(sekaï-world IIRC)), now that I have grown up and such (was huge fan in HS, now 5years later with my works etc), I find it really cringy now when I look back. So it's more because of the weeb's cliché that people react like this and to be franck with you, your post is kind of cringeworthy. 
---
Anyways for some great anime not-so-maintstream that I can still recommend : Guiltycrown / Overlord / Psycho-pass / nanatsu no taisai / Gate / Shieldhero / every Trigger studio anime (Kill la Kill / Promare / Gurren Lagan / Darling in the franxx) / Parasite / Ajin / Wakfu (don't know about an english sub for this one as it's a french anime)
---
Other classic anime like : Samourai Shamploo / Samurai 7 / One punch man / Avatar : The last Airbender / Full Metal achimist : Brotherhood / Cowboy beepop / Berserk / Code:Geass
---
Not everything is so black and white.
---
I can tolerate it. I don't particularly enjoy it, but it's mostly an issue when I'm doing something solo anyways.
---
I often play games that I don't 100% enjoy because my friends are playing them and I enjoy playing with my friends enough to deal with it. That's basically the only reason I play Overwatch anymore.
---
Enjoy your empty zones and bare AH, I'll take high/full pop any day. Way more fun.
---
Just reroll, you'll be happier in the long run. Especially if you are on the smaller faction on your server.
---
Just some shards and get ready to Shadowbolt spam and be sad when you get multiple resists in a row and fall to the bottom of the damage meter. :D
---
Honestly tank should be watching for a big heal before he pulls. If the tank needs healed he needs healed, pulling or not
---
I'm sure you were consistently able to solo-farm ~100g+ gold per hour while in a healing spec on a Priest in dungeons, am I right?
---
Ask for some kind of cc on the main target, pull ahead and shift out/innervate/shift in. Even just innervating preemptively when someone accidentally pulls a few additional mobs midfight has saved teams from wipes so many times. Alongside the battle rez bear tanks are the fuckin swiss army in any dungeon group.
---
If you learn in each dungeon what targets are the most threatening or the easiest to kill and you won't ever need to run back.
---
Maybe you're forging the new meta for hunters. It's always possible that the class has been overlooked by serious theorycrafters for other classes like mages, rogues, and feral druids.
---
308 weapon skill and 1% hit from items is enough
---
WoW without pvp is not a game.
---
Become the tank or the healer and partner with each other and kick the idiots who can't wait 1 minute
---
Just to note, everyone is an enemy in the arena at all times, not just when the chest spawns. Even after it is looted your own faction can kill you.
---
At the current gear level, a 9 minute run just isn't possible without obscenely good luck, so consistent 9-mins are out of the question. The redditor you replied to is talking out of their arse. If you add in that such a low time would likely require no improved feign death, it's even more unlikely to be consistent.
---
The serpents of Wailing Caverns are pretty good, should be around your level :-)
---
The most powerful thing in this game is a Chad tank and a Stacy healer who work together. As the tank you pace the run and decide what needs to be pulled and when. Your healer is the disciplinarian, if the DPS pull aggro when they shouldn't it's the healer's job to let them die and teach them a lesson. If the tank and the healer are good and are working together the DPS are just along for the ride.
---
When I form a group as a tank I invite a known good healer, we go straight to the instance and start pulling trash with 2 of us as we spam LFG. All the DPS are there for is to speed up our clear time.
---
they've been eagles and all of them have been created by the strongest god who lived in middle earth.
---
as comparison, sauron was created by the second strongest god. so they are on the same level as sauron and since they are so mighty and dont live close to the population of middle earth, their problems were not relevant to them.
---
iirc gandalf had special relation to them abd they did him a favor.
---
Your Class\faction should help for suggestions ...
---
I’ve never played on a PvE server, and I’ve played since 2005.
---
But I actually fare well in this game. I’ve come out 1v1 as a survivor in most situations. Hell, 2 on 1 is fine. 
---
You aren’t hearing what I’m saying, and that’s ok. But if you could just do me a huge solid and go shit in your hand and go downstairs and show your parents what a good job you did, I’m sure they would be impressed.
---
Run along now.
---
Maybe they think /s is synonym for "hehe"
---
People on over servers have strange ideas about what happens on PvP servers. I've played on 3 different vanilla private servers, I play Ally on a horde dominated PvP server right now, and not once in my entire life have I ever been camped for more than 10mins. I've levelled to 60 4 times on PvP servers mind you.
---
If you get camped for 2 hours straight you are doing some funky shit. Like maybe if you refuse to leave a farming area controlled by the opposite faction. But then you'd just be an idiot.
---
Just buy lessser invis pots, if you get camped, ress, pop ot and run away. stop crying pussies.
---

In this bracket you can start heading toward Blackrock Deep and the Sunken Temple (temple of atal'akkar) Then at lvl 55 you can start UBRS/LBRS/Dire Maul as a healer and 58-60 you can go for scholo/stratholme/UBRS/LBRS/BRD in full clean
---
Thank You! :)
---
Join the PvE side, we have cookies :)
---
The only downside is that PvE servers are quite crowded right now and population on them is too high to remove layers.
---
Wolf howl for bonus physical damage aoe. It doesn't reach you anyway after it goes to his enemy, helps melee dmg party members.
---
Cat for damage output. Claw+bite. Also Broken Tooth has 1.0 attack per second, makes the best caster interrupter.
---
Bats/owls has screech that lowers damage done and aoe aggroes. But I use broken tooth as my main pet. Wolf for parties that might need a bit buffed.
---
If you want to play the game for RP, go on. But for PVP or serious business, most epic looking animals are just trash.
---
Sorry to hear that, i will give you a complimentary milk and cookies for your nappy time.
---
Never thought about it but rogues should have MASSIVE quads.
---
WHERE IS IT!?
---
But just ask you this question: what does it add to reward lvl60 to kill 48 even if it's a tiny amount of honor?
---
I mean if the game only rewarded honor to kill people with the same or above level, why would it be less interesting?
---
You also have to understand how the honor system works. If you’re getting camped by a higher lvl like a 60 and you’re in SM when they kill you they are getting dishonorable kills which goes against the pvp ranking system
---
No.  Each phase has a shelf life, the Naxx one included.
---
I'd still rather see Classic+ than TBC.
---
I want *new* content built in the *old* game.
---
Honestly that's why you level up with a group. I'm playing with two friends, and sure we might not stand a chance against a 60 right now, but at least we have a better chance at escaping or at least making the ganker waste his time.
---
The CS and arcane bolt makes these guys formidable enemies. A skull target if there ever was one. 
---
However, if it's focused down quickly the packs are trivial. Rogues are awesome on these casters.
---
Find me someone who claims to have participated in a DKP system without one iota of abuse and I'll show you an idiot.
---
The system is inherently flawed for a social game about working together. 
---
What is this "Objective/Subjective" system you're talking about?
---
Objectivity is determining who is getting what for the a combined goal.
---
Subjectivity is arbitrarily giving people points and having them play Auction House mini game to get gear, unsure or how to plan since who knows if they'll get the piece they want for free, or lose everything for it.
---
But then again, that probably is objective since the DKP system is perfect for cheating gear towards yourself, especially with large raids. That's as objective as it gets.
---
I don't argue. I just pull / charge what I want.
---
If I'm tanking, it's my pace they follow. If they try to skip, I pull. If they pull, they die.
---
There's a very good reason that tanks have a stereotype of being jerks, because that's the sustainable long-term attitude in that role.
---
Oh really! Thanks!
---
As a healer, god bless you my dude.
---
I tried fury/prot as well and had a similar experience. Honestly I think for dungeons deep prot is just easier as a tank to deal with, whereas fury/prot is primarily for raids. If you're ultra geared, then fury/prot is probably still better in 5 mans, but not only am I not ultra geared, but not having tactical mastery was a huge detriment to me. 
---
I might re-spec to fury/prot once I get my druid tank to 60, so I still have a tank for dungeons, but for right now deep prot has served me well in all content.
---
For sure, me personally main hunter and do DM tribute runs for gold.
---
But for a tank with limited googling resources being a hired tank is better then idling in OG/IF.
---
Semantics, alliance have it easier. You need to get over it. - 20%threat raidwide by default is insane
---
Oh yeah I remember that stuff.  Cool, thanks for the tip.
---
BOLVAR!
---
To enter Onyxia you need to do quite long quest chain. And it's 55-58.  
---
All raid bosses are level 63, so your chances to him them would be really low.
---
I'll tank on my warlock if I want, you can't tell me shit.
---
Do I really need to explain to you the difference in PvP balance between CoD and a lvl 60 killing a lvl 30 player?
---
People who kill other people who can't protect them self in the slightest are a very sad kind of people to me.
---
Deauxboy. 29 rogue. WE NEED TO GET TO 60 asap!
---
I feel privileged that I got into what seems like a pretty good guild. We killed rag first time 5 weeks ago and we now just 1 shot it, I feel very very carried by the other 39 players, they will probably eventually replace me.
---
"possible" but not "propable" I'd say, but depends on the class.
---
Warrior? no fcking way
---
Frost mage? Could go naked
---
0.5 second cast time per auto shot.
---
We disenchanted 2 pieces of shaman tier 2 yesterday because our 40 man didn’t have a single one.
---
We also lack druids and warlocks so much.
---
Hunters also appear to be full 8/8
---
We know
---
Melee classes get +weapon skill to help mitigate glancing blows damage reduction. Range dont have that issue. So it's pointless to get it on a Hunter unless you're playing a melee spec.
---
You ask the same questions constantly, what does having an epic mount or sword of zeal have to do with gear set effects anyway? If you knew your class you wouldn’t have to be asking what’s better to use
---
well the context was the issue
---
28manning the thing last week since we hadn't merged with another guild completely, got to garr and tanks were just getting squished, had to spam whatever i can or else they died within seconds
---
i don't HAVE to go full holy, but i'd rather be prepared for anything, 5% helps
---
Jesus christ, get over yourself.
---
Or maybe /sorry?
---
I used elvui name plates. If you struggle with dispel clicking the discolored ones will fix it. Once you get past the first group, its easy. I went in to check this on my first try (it was late I wanted to make sure I was setup for success) and ended up clearing it with a lot to spare. Dispelling was the hardest part since my nameplates weren't setup to show debuffs.
---
Ugh I hate the differing opinions on need vs. greed. 
---
In my opinion, you only ever need on an item if you are going to immediately equip it as an upgrade, or you're rolling off against someone for your off-spec and so are they. Greed is for "I wanna sell\DE this". Greed = money, need = I need to *use* this. 
---
People who use the need function because "hurr Durr everyone *needs* gold" can go fuck right off.
---
Wooooow, the cringe level...
---
Someone don't read no good
---
Because you're removing the reward for regular pvp.
---
Level differences don't matter *nearly* as much in pvp as they do in pve.
---
Mitigation and avoidance are great, but at some point you'll want to prioritize threat generation as high as possible. If the groups are putting out more damage, your healer's performance will be less strained as packs die faster. Higher damage output means your DPS are outputting more threat, which you can balance out by focusing more on your own threat.
---
When I'm fully geared out, my tank will be hitcapped and have around 25% crit. In the average group, I'll still have 9K armor, 13% dodge and over 6K life.
---
&gt; (DPS was all 41/42 I believe.)
---
This is the issue. They won't be able to kill level 47 boss fast enough.
---
5-6 level difference is too much, it's red color mobs for them.
---
TSM for sure. Use the app as well.
---
Killing a grey player is no challenge at all.
---
Thanks for the new pasta.
---
Not specific to what you asked for but there’s a great podcast called ‘Countdown to Classic’.
---
You don't need that +20rf back?
---
Yeah, those prices lasted maybe 2 days after release, these days you’d be lucky to sell the ring for 15g and anything else for more than 30g on my server. With the time it takes to boost someone, it’s usually not worth it unless they’re a stealthier.
---
I seriously feel like an idiot for keeping keys I’m not presently using in my bank. Gimme a ring!
---
Do you still get auto-ported if your hearth is on CD? 
---
I do remember at least one instance of leaving the group for the auto-port but it never happened, and I'm not sure if hearth was on CD. I got auto-ported from ZF last time, and it does spend your hearthstone.
---
So you get warriors, rogues, mages, priest, shaman? Seems like an excellent mono-race option.
---
Little tip for y'all,
---
Every, I cannot stress enough, \*EVERY\* account should have a 40 mage strictly for portal utility. 
---
Invite your main/alt and invite a third guild member or friend. Use your mage to make a portal while both of your characters are in party, then quickly log onto your main/alt and use the port. 
---
Every class with a mage on your account is a free portal
---
Mirage Raceway is also very active.
---
Took me around 12 or 13 runs. Didn't see the cape, then of course both the stonespine cape and baron cape drop the same run.
---
I use VanasKOS
---
Depends on what dungeon and what kind of group you are going with. 
---
If your only AOE class dies when doing AOE heavy pulls, maybe it’s not the wisest.
---
Just use your gut and punish people when it’s safe. Don’t want to risk your own repairbill.
---
Don’t do it with hunters or rogues though, they’ll just send the mob back to you or the healer.
---
Sssssssssshhhh... You're ruining my scam!
---
Its always warlock and druid gear out the ass.

You also don't need to. If I'm a rogue and I'm blowing up the caster don't waste effort trying to taunt it from me. I'm keeping it kicked and it's doing next to no physical damage to me. Focus on the other mobs that actually hit hard, all without having to worry about random spike damage from shadowbolts or whatever.
---
My buddy is a warrior and we roll with an understanding that it isn't uncommon for me to essentially off-tank a caster mob.
---
Maybe he had something else to say

I have never seen a Warlock ever get close to pulling threat, lol.
---
I hate spell batching as much as the next guy (probably more tbh), but this really had nothing to do with it.
---
He went from level 1 to level 2 and got one shot by a level 24 wolf lmao.
---
Can't tell if serious or just really good at satire.
---
I just got the chest out of DM N tribute and called it a day. It's not as good, but fuck it, it's good enough.
---
Even then if you out gear the dungeon youd be better of as fury prot
---
I lost my first roll around 10 runs in. I was I. There from 54 all the way to 60. Got it about an hour or two after I dinged, it was a nice present. Almost like a good job you made it, you can finally have your loot now lol.
---
Do you have any patch notes on the mc nerf? This seems to be goinf around yet i've never seen any.
---
Most I've seen were minor changes to some dungeons.
---
Ofc loot is different, but that's different from saying mc was nerfed.
---
So does sending it to an alt ? Only the return is instant
---
Has it been promised for p2? I thought it was just “coming soon”.

I'm noticing this as well, i'm not sure if its a "Catch up" mechanic for people you're leveling with to keep you at a similar point quest item wise or what. but I noticed I got 0 of them the entire time I was partied with these people and when I checked they were at like 5-10 of them each and I saw they were getting them to drop.
---
The talent calc you posted doesnt really fit PvP or PvE. Frostbite/Shatter are not compatible with AoE farm as they will mess up your grouping of mobs. Also you only have 2/5 Winter’s Chill so if you’re showing up as WC spec (there should only be one WC mage per raid) you won’t be putting up the debuff very quickly for your fellow mages. I recommend just going the default AP frost 31/20 spec for raiding and respeccing to AoE farm the rest of the week. 100g on respec a week is not much for a mage - you can recoup the gold in ZF/DM farming in about 2-3 hours. 
---
If you don’t want to respec and your guild wants you as the WC mage for raiding, try this spec which allows you to AoE farm very easily while still bringing the required utility to raid:

---
Overrated in pvp. It’s good against warriors but you don’t even need it against them. It’ll be purged otherwise.
---
What so you basically bought dkp for gold?
---
People pretend to understand weapon skill but they don't blurgh
---
In vanilla wow I was lvl 45 when the honor system released. I had a BLAST! It was the most fun I have ever had in the history of wow. Massive world pvp fights because flight masters in hillsbrad were being camped. Rogues around every shadowy corner in cities looking for trouble! It was awesome and was the one time the game was truly WARCRAFT. 
---
Then battlegrounds released and wrecked pvp for good. Boring scripted run to objective or camp GY. Boring do the same thing over and over again
---
“top tier if not the best PvP class”
---
*laughs in warlock*
---
LookingForGroup channel and trade chat, or just /Y in mayor cities.
---
That is actually really awesome to hear!
---
Very few Warlocks, but that has always been the case.
---
Raiding guilds usually have a bunch of lowlevels too, who do dungeons and quests together. So don't let that keep you away from the raiding guilds :)
---
what the what ?...........
---
Cata baby here, I'm loving Classic and have about 20 days of /played on my main.
---
1. Yes.  One way to remove the safe spot is to attack Qia (open rep tab, switch the booty bay(?) faction to 'at war' and attack Qia, then switch it back off after you die).  a guard will spawn in that location and will attack anyone attacking from that safe spot in the future.
---
2. Not sure what you mean, but I don't know anyway.
---
My favorite part is that it's like month 3 and you're guild name is Speedrun. 
---
Either way congratz, that 1st Rag kill always feel awesome.
---
If the mob switched target to you it’s most likely growl picking them up. The pet needs to get far more then 2 hits in to revert agro. 
---
Depending on what made the mob switch agro in the first place. Usually after a aimed shot for me.
---
XP wise you've only just crossed the halfway point. Digest that.
---
This is fantastic advice, thank you! I agree with just doing 31/20 arcane for raiding, I was leaning towards that but your reply basically confirms that. The guild isn't requiring me to go WC, so I think I may just go arcane. 
---
Just one more question if you don't mind: 
---
How would this do for AOE farming? I feel like this might be a bit more PVP viable with shatter as well. 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/230005001--05350233132351301
---
And lastly, is there a go to PVP frost spec you'd recommend. 
---
Thanks again!
---
Just run dungeouns. Cant get ganked in them if you are so afraidnof world pvp
---
It’s not “fast” by today’s standards, I don’t even calculate my gph there anymore. It’s just easily doable once you know the few mob types, and very consistent.  I just like the fact that it doesn’t rely on losing AH deposits and stuff, it’s raw gold.
---
Yes you still get ported, thats also a way people usually "cheat" hearth CD, since it still use your hearth and put it back on 1h CD, no matter what your CD was
---
Because it's not actually 50/50, it's alphabetical so in this case OP would've won.
---
Yeah fuck Flipstar pulling that 1 number wheel of fortune bullshit
---
Goes for 300 on my server, I bought it for 275g.
---
In my experience:
---
&gt;RL on disc: "Let the tank get aggro for 5-10 seconds before you start dpsing, it's not a dps race here folks. Literally just count to 10."
---
&gt;*RL*: So anyway I started charging.
---
I’m really glad to hear that.  The server desperately needs a guild like that.  Rather than some guy trying to make Olympus on the server last night lol
---
This has not been my experience at all so far. I constantly get whispered asking if I can tank dungeons. So far all the way up to LBRS. I do not expect to MT MC, but so far most have been happy to have me as a tank/DPS. When I finally respec to HotW/NS I should be able to heal or tank 5 mans quite easily.
---
Ugh. Yeah, gonna have to do same. Fortunately, I like UBRS. I'll probably run it dozens of times for funsies.
---
If you have aggro issues, put on more threat gear. If idiot mages don't know how to dps, don't let them drink to full. Ez
---
The only person that is super important not to get feared is the MT, and they can sort fear out by themselves. Fear ward is superiors to buff tank with because it works immediately, tremor pulses and if you don't get a pulse for 5 seconds the boss will follow the tank, turn toward the raid and wipe everyone in the next cone attack
---
Dumbass popped his sprint before even getting  out of stealth.
---
What a jabroni.
---
An impatient rogue is a dead rogue.
---
For others to see - you don't actually need imp FD.  I run it w/o and I've only had like one run ruined out of 20 because of it.  I'd say if your 100% interested in dm trib then respec but if you raid/dungeon in between id say its not neccessary 
---
personally i just did enough runs (\~20) to get 2x my rings and a barb blade.  It's fun and I may go back to it but I find grinding mobs in the open world relaxing/chill rather than hyper focused on successful runs.  I may go back to it eventually to switch things up
---
I've never made so much gold off of greens before.  Keep buying you meme bis greens everybody!!
---
I guess it really is the necklace, getting 25 of each from 2 different tribes ugh.....
---
Better than having like 3 hours of raiding you can do per week before there's nothing to do for the week
---
And here I was thinking /s was to indicate that the whole conversation is finished due to the comment it is a part of.
---
For what it's worth, my guild is requiring paladins to go full Holy for now, but we're running MC with two raids of 25 people. We're a pretty casual guild, so we do need people to be raid spec'd to clear MC, especially when each raid only has 6-7 healers.
---
If guilds think MC is easy mode and are benching 10+ raiders, I encourage them to try splitting into two raids for double the loot.
---
I think humanity lost by being exposed to the words of a pompous asshole such as yourself. I am just an observer, not the guy you have been debating.
---
Do you have a source for this? I always thought it was just alphabetical, since every tie I've seen ended that way anyway.
---
Ashbringer offers the best ratio, but keep in mind that most players on ashbringer are pretty casual, so if you're looking to take the game somewhat seriously I'd consider Mograine over ashbringer.
---
yeah but raiding guilds also have tons of people. i see them advertising as having like "200+ members". im not comfortable in large groups so i want a small guild with like maybe 10 people
---
Me too. Is it a rogue thing? :D
---
Its in the eye of the viewer. The runs where my dps have started to spazz out is because our tank is legit the slowest mothafucker in the world.
---
Everyone is full mana, and everything is chill, better wait 20 seconds before next pull because, I actually dont know why, but fuck it, lets wait.
---
Hi I'm looking for help with a macro
---
On all my characters, Shift + C is bandage, except or my healing classes I use that for my fastest heal. 
---
Well on my shadow priest main I'd like to have a macro that checks to see if I'm in shadowform and if I am, it bandages, and if I'm not, it casts flash heal. Is that possible and if so, how would I do it?
---
When it's killing mob it's fine, but finding 25 necklaces from 2 different troll tribes ugh...
---
Thrash/Mirah's, I think that still edges out Cho'Rush/Mirah's.
---
Pfff keys...
---
I can't talk, though. I blew up my raid with Living Bomb after we killed Baron Geddon last night.
---
In my defense, I saw -Combat and thought the debuff ended, since it was my first time as the bomb.
---
Vir’jin is the guild leader, real nice guy and dedicated RPr.
---
I wasn’t.  I even did a few lol level dungeons as we were all leveling up. For two days i asked for help on a quest after helping several others and literally got told that if I couldn’t do it myself I should just leave the area.  I left the guild instead.
---
You first have to speak with some GOBLIN in ratchet, who gives 2 quests for both goblin and gnomish engineering.
---
He is in the same building as Gazlowe. (at least for horde)
---
Typical grandma/grandpa. Always posting comments in the most bizarre places
---
Finally some good news for my lvl 46 warrior
---
i treat the looking for group channel as for dungeon groups. not guild groups. and im not trying to trade guilds either, so that wouldnt work. i havent seen any guilds yelling in cities either
---
Since the blue set wont be out until phase 6, your only option is R13, which is reserved for the most most hardcore of neckbeards.
---
This also requires the best gear in the game, unless you're a top 5-10% PvP'er.
---
It's bis for enh for a long time, don't see what you're whining about.
---
Opportunity cost, if the healer isn't doing anything important like casting a heal then yeah, but if something avoidable like a mage pulling aggro and drawing mobs toward the healer happens while the healer is chain casting heals on the tank and the mage who's already been hit 3 times then moving means at least one of those two people probably die or burn 30 minute cooldowns trying to avoid being dead
---
I know, and I usually don,t mind it, but I keep getting ganked by trolls gorrillas tigers.... and walking back takes 5 minutes.
---
i have the opposite problem. i want to find groups for lower level dungeons, but 90% of the posts i see are for max level dungeons
---
Well that certainly makes the coding simpler
---
I’d recommend farming things that give you necessary rep, depending on your plans for raiding and such
---
The difference is everyone plays mage.
---
So if you are a Druid, hunter or warlock some of the least played classes this time around you have a far greater choice of being the only class in the grp.
---
JUST GIVE ME MY REWARDS FOR GANKING THESE REDS
---
I think well done housing could keep people indefinitely. Basically the only reason I even have an active sub to FFXIV is for the housing system, and it's definitely the most fun I've ever had in the game. 
---
I've never played WoW before Classic, so I can't speak for the housing system in retail, but if it was a fiasco, I'd say that had more to do with their implementation than the idea itself. There's a massive amount of room for developer interpretation when you say "player owned housing", and how the developer chooses to implement is really what separates good housing systems from the rest.
---
that is some profit
---
I always start that quest, but never finish it.
---
You realize that you can use the teleporter just outside the Gnomer instance entrance to teleport to Booty Bay, right?
---
All that rage and still so sensitive, take it easy my rogue-curious friends. It was just a joke
---
This is only applicable when the mobs you are fighting are bosses.  Bosses are classified as level 63 in the system for hit purposes.  If you are grinding on level 60 or lower mobs or enemy players, you will need substantially less hit.  I don't know the actual numbers but this is one major reason pvp gear lists have so much less hit rating.
---
It's astonishing to me how often this is happening in classic. Every few runs I'll get that one guy who thinks we're going way too slow and just wants to pull and aoe everything. 
---
4 happy people going at a good pace, playing their role, no deaths or anything. But somehow that isn't enough for mr.wecangofasterwtf
---
I've often had enough of their shit and just kick them from the group and everyone else is happy to see him gone. But of course I get a whisper laughing at me saying I'm a stupid kid and a shit tank haha
---
Yes, and I don't really know I just ignore it becuase Ive never played any class that could even think about winning a free for all
---
But why would it stop low level to do some pvp? they would simply fight between them with people their level.
---
And in case you didn't played vanilla, realize that low level get lower amount of honor and therefore can barely compete with the amount of lvl60 (and since you compete against them)
---
Yes yes we do
---
You’re nothing compared to the Gnome only guilds, NOTHING

---
Alot of good mage info in this sheet. Check the talents tab.
---
I'd suggest joining the mage discord also and reading the Pins.
---
[https://discord.gg/4svKQAc](https://discord.gg/4svKQAc)
---
This. I'm the guy that keeps every key with me all the time. Lifesaver for runs, as nobody else does, but it eats basically a whole bag of space. I realize one or two keys don't work with the ring...maradon staff, I think, doesn't? But it helps. It helps a lot.
---
315 weapon skill is a ludricous amount. I'm pretty sure it's impossible without a couple MC pieces.
---
Hahahahahahaaha if that were true, my main would be named Aa. If you 2 people roll the same number, the game does a non-printed reroll. It's not based on the characters name lmao
---
Tutorials say EPL bats are a good way to farm gold by selling greys. If they are occupied, try to farm zombies in WPL fields with argent dawn undead dmg trinket. Since they are low level and you have rested bonus, you'll not have a hard time and level asap.
---
That vanish pose though... He should have said nohomo
---
You LoS'd your healer.  You deserve that death.
---
I believe there's just a stigma against druids tanking/healing 5-mans (only having combat res). I play a warrior which explains why I haven't seen any bears, I've only seen 5-6 druids in my groups from 25-60, having the one cat druid I've had top meters, so I definitely don't think the stigma holds any ground but that has been my experience.
---
It was supposed to come out in the first patch.
---
You're thinking of /thread.
---
I'm 25 and really patient but you are right. My wife for exemple can't stand waiting in line or just waiting for something. Hopefully I'm patient for 2 and deal with it pretty easily but I perfectly understand where you come from with this observation
---
For arms you want maximum topend damage for burst and ability scaling, but its not always that simple gotta keep raw stats and dps/speed in mind aswell and think abit.
---
Example.
---
3.8 speed 260 max damage
---
3.4 speed 255 max damage
---
In that scenario the 3.4 has much more dps and i would still go for that one.
---
Bring a ton of shards. Bring Demonic Runes if you've got 'em. Expect that you may need to use your Imp as an HP totem for the tanks all run.
---
If you have time, could you describe how a mage beats a warlock, SP and hunter at the same time? Almost effortless that is.
---
You basically could build your own base, complete with auctioneer and bank. It just made it more of a single player experience by removing you from the rest of the players.
---
Bwl will be cleared day one lol
---
Hand of Justice.. saw it drop once, lost the roll.  😭
---
Which is totally okay, I am a rogue and I generally end up tanking mobs 50-75% of the dungeon and I generally don't die as well as the instance is cleared in 30% the time it used to take. So who cares.
---
&gt; "No one called for chest roll, thats why the roll in the beginning didn't count."
---
That's some 6-year old playground shit.
---
fuck outta here
---
What a \*thurd\*
---
I rolled up a priest on a pvp server, where I've never played a healer on a pvp server before.
---
There's been some frustration. A lot of it. But there've been a lot of unique and interesting interactions with enemy players, from straight up wars and rivalries, to just fucking around with them outside of dungeons.
---
I was laughing my ass off last night because I was waiting outside the Strat side entrance with my group. 3 horde showed up, look at my benediction gleaming on my back, and try being all friendly. We're dancing, jumping around, using non damaging abilities, etc. Then I got bored and started to MC them and run them into the instance. I was *literally* saying "Go do your dungeon already". Then I laughed like crazy.
---
So yeah, I'm enjoying myself, and MCing other players is way too much fun.
---
My guy, being pompous is just a mechanism defense against ginorqnt people telling you that you are wrong on something they understand 0 about while being rude. If all you took out here was me being pompous and not the dude being rude+ignorant, you might as well be among the ones that fail to understand anything here.
---
Thanks. I’ll remember that.
---
For #2, there are a few games out that, if you report someone and they find it ban worthy, they will notify you in game that *insert name* has been banned
---
Our hunter still needs his second. We’re so sick of tribute runs at this point we’ve had like 4 people offer to buy him one but he insists on getting the drop.
---
Really looking forward to this grind on my alt lol
---
&gt; This is just a justification for why you don't want to be on a pvp server. Which is fine, but nobody is arguing whether or not you want to roll on one.
---
My friends tried to convince me to do it.
---
&gt; So you wouldn't be playing with these friends anyways.
---
I would. But nowhere nearly as much as they claimed we would if I rolled on their realm.
---
corins crossing is also a decent place. lvls 57-58 with rested you get around 600-700 per kill.
---
You can solo tribute runs without raid gear too.
---
The only way you’ll find a guild is using chat channels. Doesn’t really matter too much which one you use, everyone uses them pretty interchangeably
---
There are many communities and guilds that actively and effectively police toxic people and remove them to promote an environment people actually enjoy being in.
---
Weird concept, I know. But maybe you ought to give these sorts of communities a try.
---
&gt;These days I log onto an Alt immediately if I'm being camped/ganked in the open world.
---
This is the best solution to being ganked that hardly anyone mentions. I constantly see people complaining in /1 about being ganked for 30+ minutes while trying to quest. Just leave. Either log an alt or GY spawn and head towards a different zone, there are plenty of options while levelling, don't give them the satisfaction.
---
The 'Spy' addon helps for this also, If I add them to my kill on sight list I feel less annoyed about not being able to get instant revenge.
---
/cast [noform] Flash Heal
---
/use insertbandagenamehere
---
You can add #showtooltip Flash Heal to the beginning if you want it to show your flash heal stuff, or #showtooltip Runecloth Bandage or whatever bandage you use if you want it to show the tooltip for that.
---
I was trying to get it all weekend. I cannot wait for it to finally drop. Hopefully a tank doesnt take it from me.
---
The threat enchant sucks though. You're never in a situation where 2% threat is going to make or break you.
---
If a DPS pulls threat, it's because they got a string of crit at the same time that the tank got a string of dodge/miss/parry.
---
My guild was a group of 10-15 guys that all knew each other in one way or another. Only 4-5 of us were 50+ so I proposed merging with a larger guild which we did, it's worked very well so far, and we still have our own discord for if we're doing stuff just us.
---
Tanaris is a good tip.  No quests are down there, so only farmers will be down there.  Just keep in mind the only GY is at Gadgetzan.  It's a long run and if you die without looting a mob, it may despawn before you get back.
---
FML.  Did BRD with 2 mages and a lock.  Fuckers would just unload as soon I charged.
---
nah no different for leveling.  I liked having a cat with stealth for pvp purposes but wolf with howl just as good for leveling
---
all the dungeons were nerfed a lot by the time 1.12 came out
---
Well,  Bloodlust was introduced when the alliance got shamans.  Right?  That's a pretty big deal.
---
Lol I'd forgotten about this.  It's so good - just keeps going and going.
---
There used to be a bunch of people selling leveling services that would always spam chat channels. A friend of mine pretended to do that as well and when someone was dumb enough to actually give him login info, he'd put all their gear and items in the bank, deleted their Hearthstone and swam to the middle of the ocean as well.
---
It almost makes up for the Alliance PvP experience
---
when i look for guilds in modern wow, i always go through the forums and theres tons of options to choose from. but the classic forums seem super dead for some reason. like not even 1 post a day
---
no, thats just plain stupid, if its a 3 gold Bop item and someone needs it, they cant just buy it from the AH, they have to get it to drop, if its a BOE fucking edgemasters drop, they can walk their dumb ass to the AH and buy it there.
---
Ah, I can see how that would hurt the game. Based on your description, I'm picturing something similar to the Construction house you could make in Runescape, where other players COULD come to your house, but they really had no incentive to. That's really the only other housing system I could think of that's single player. 
---
The main reason I like housing in FFXIV is because it's in what's called "wards". So I'm in ward 3, and that particular ward has 60 different houses in it. I don't do it as often as I used to, but especially when I was still trying to decide how I wanted my house to look, or while I was learning about all the different housing items (and there are hundreds available), I would just walk through my housing ward and look through people's houses. You meet people doing that, and there's areas in each ward where people tend to congregate - like the market board. It keeps the game feeling social, even though you won't have the massive crowds that you would at a capital city MB.
---
What's sad is I love my Warlock but just rerolled to Druid. 
---
Not only is it hard for any DPS to find a group, I've now seen groups wanting Mages more than Locks for Poly/free Water. 
---
What's even more annoying is now I see all these Mages (at least on Skeram) wanting to charge for water. For clicking a button.
---
Got fed up. Rerolled a Druid.
---
”Joke” groups.
---
Yesterday I had a SM Library run where something amazing happened.  I'm running a mage, we had two DPS warriors, a healer druid, and a bear tank.  In true Reddit form, I should be the bad guy in this story, but no.  I was the first one waiting at the instance.  When everyone else arrived, I was afk for a minute, but the tank decided fuck it and started anyway.  
---
After having to throw up buffs and make some water in the middle of a fight because they started without me, for the entire run my mana bar never got above 50%.  Every time we finished off a pack, the tank ran immediately up to the next one.  Not only that, but every time I sheeped a stray caster or ranged mob the tank ran over to break it and pick up the mob anyway. In his defense, the healer's mana was fine, and we had enough DPS that I could sit out a pack to drink or just autowand to keep the regen going.  And we never had a single death.  
---
After we finished the run, the tank said he had to bail and immediately hearthed out.  It was only then that the rest of us realized that we'd have to make our way back through the dungeon to get to the SM lobby - the first third of the dungeon had already respawned so at that point, I had to thank God that our tank had been so impatient, otherwise that would've been a lot worse.
---
I do this with my brother. I'm the tank and he's the healer so it's easy to fill groups. And if anyone plays stupid games, is really annoying and wants to go faster we just kick him and fill his spot. All about staying in control over those people
---
We’ll stop complaining when they start listening

&gt; I maxed my professions while also hitting 60 the second week the game came out with just over 7 days played.
---
Good for you, but you aren't what's being discussed here. If we were comparing you to Joanna or other speed levelers you would be considered slow. But this isn't compared to the fastest, it's compared to averages, of which you are clearly above. Therefore, using an anecdote of yourself only proves it's possible (duh), but not whether it is slow/fast. 
---
&gt; The people who did dungeons to get full blues with each set of dungeons hit 60 in 1.5 months or so.
---
What do you base this upon? The people you know in your guild of like-minded people? I feel I have to ask, since you thought a single anecdote regarding yourself would in any way support your argument. 
---
&gt; 3 months is the casuals casual.
---
Why do you keep saying 3 months, when it's only a bit over 2 months in? Are you purposely trying to skew the discussion? 
---
&gt; You are just flat out wrong.
---
What am I wrong about? Feel free to point it out and use actual arguments, but simply making such a statement without any specification is useless. 
---
&gt; It takes anywhere from 7-10 days played to hit 60 if you aren’t afk or literally wasting your time for most of the time.
---
What do you have to support that claim? I don't agree and I'd love to show you some reasoning as to why that is: 
---
The average time to level to 60 on private servers was something around 8 days /played, and that's with the boosted XP-gains. Add another day to compensate and let's make it 9 days /played. Now, I would argue that the average player on a private server is vastly more experienced than the average player in Classic, meaning the 9 days /played from private servers, likely isn't applicable to the average for Classic. 
---
Based upon the things I've seen from people that don't have too much experience with Classic itself, they certainly aren't making it in the timeframe you've listed as a **MUST** (if they aren't to be accused of being afk or wasting time).

But if you have a credible source to quote on it, or simply disagree, feel free to let me know and I'll look at it. But I don't blindly accept your 7-10 days criteria without you supporting it. 
---
&gt; I just will not entertain the argument that you can level 1 character at an enjoyable pace and still not be 60 if you were actually putting in any effort to get it.
---
So, the people that are inexperienced/new to Classic aren't "putting in any effort", is that it? Keep in mind that these people are part of the statistic that makes up your "7-10 days played to hit 60".
---
theres no rng involved. if you do too much dps you pull agro
---
You can cast instant spells. It will interrupt the channel, but they will get the buff.
---
That was my thinking on it, i'm not at home to actually test it but it should work that way. If you're out of form it'll just cast flash heal and bandage won't go off, if you're in form it won't try to cast flash heal. 
---
Im not sure if you can put a conditioner on use items, if you can you could try to add [form:1] in the bandage macro.
---
Let’s say a BIS dagger drops in MC for rogues. Should all rogues be able to roll on the dagger since they could respec if they are currently swords? Or should only the dagger spec rogues get priority?
---
Don't forget viper sting!
---
Yes you can do it.  If you play to get as much xp as possible.  Don't volunteer  for helping people in dungeons where you don't have quests.  Don't try to farm BiS.  Don't Farm Gold.  Just shoot for completeing as many quests ans you can and grinf the highest XP way you are capable of you can do it.  If you play 4-5 hours a day you should be able to get 1.5 - 2 levels a day if you don't waste a lot of time doing no xp stuff like travelling, crafting, etc
---
Is there anywhere like this with horde friendly npcs in a contested zone?
---
I recommend doing the Ony pre quest in BRD.
---
It is chill EXP because you also get gear and you sooner or later have to do it anyway for the pre quest.
---
Better get it over with :P Also the EXP (especially rested) you get from BRD is not bad!

Blue post on forum says hidden roll

"

&gt;There is a second hidden roll to determine the winner of a tie.

Correct, well actually it's an infinite number of rolls until a winner is found. "

in no way is it  alphabetical

Gnomes hole*
---
A lot of the mobs turn neutral after the run, even without the buff. The hunter just helps the person through the hostile mobs.
---
This is how wipes happen
---
Uhm
---
I doubt selling gold is that common, I’m skeptical that the average player who spent 2-3 hours to farm 100g is going to bother selling it for $5 or whatever the price is. Buying gold is definitely a massive thing, though, especially now that in Retail the practice is condoned by Blizzard themselves.
---
Sorry to disappoint but it will not be just one shots.
---
Because sometimes the memes write themselves
---
Cept its usually the GM's friends made officers, officers get loot first, say it's cause they're the best in the guild, people get pissed and complain on reddit.
---
1v1 pvp balance is way different than 2v2, 3v3.
---
I mean, why not? If they're at Garr they killed three bosses. If they're fine with wiping because of low numbers occasionally, who cares?
---
Hit "o" for the social menu. Click the raid tab at the bottom and as long as you're leader or have assist you can assign roles from there.
---
Not really. 1 skill =/= 1% hit. It is confirmed by Blizzard you need 9% hit at 300 skill and you need 5% hit from 315 weapon skill. Which is easily obtained by racial and talents.
---
It's definitely possible, but I can't say for certain since leveling speed is completely subjective. Levels 50-60 have taken 4-6 hours each, depending on how focused I am.
---
Im revered with argent dawn never having equipped the trinket doing exclusively scholo for my helm and boots. Still only have the helm.
---
It’s because people use the in game chat channels for those things. The biggest part of classic is the sense of server community, which is honestly kinda devalued if you have to go outside of the game to look for things. That’s why the chat channels are used pretty interchangeably.
---
A faster Mount could help you get to Elemental Farming faster too.
---
So...by starting an interesting PvP project did you mean copy CDL?
---
As a warlock, players who rush to tagsteal a mob I have dotted up already are almost always mages. Most of the players on my ignore list are mages. Gnome mages in particular have an even higher rate of being dicks.
---
Ok I've done a lot of experimenting on ways to reliably go the quickest and make sure I never get locked out/hearthed and this is the best method I've come up with. Use the in game timer, reset with your alt, don't start the timer until you see your character inside the dungeon, and don't log out until you see 12:00 on the timer. Any corners I've tried to cut in terms of logging on to my alt a little sooner or starting the timer from when I press the reset button rather than when I log back into my main end up getting me hearthed out. It's only a really big deal if you are resetting by logging out because messing it up gets you hearthed. If you're running back to the entrance and not resetting by logging out then it's not really a big deal cause if you lock yourself out you can just wait outside the dungeon.
---
If you can't safely pull aggro from dps - let them suffer. By safely i mean without losing rest of mobs and without pulling more. While dps dealing with whatever he pulled - build good threat on everything you have on you, and if by then dps is fine move to pull from him. However, be sure to communicate afterwards, to prevent such shit from happening again.
---
My 30s as a rogue were hell until I got blade furry and everything just changed, being able to take on more than two mobs really helped me progress mostly solo
---
He can't dungeon. Or else, doing 2-3 BRD and BRS runs will already get him 60.
---
&gt;main concern about loot council
---
If that's your concern, then congratulations, you found a bad guild. Generally, people should be apart of those discussions. Even in a 40 man raid, it's easy enough to determine who needs what and what people's availabilities are.
---
Why are you not communicating with people in a social game?
---
&gt;In DKP and ep/gp everybody plays by the same rules
---
Absolute BS, DKP is one of the most arbitrary systems, and every guild I've ever been in or heard of that's used it has never stuck to a consistent set of rules. It's like the Constitution. A set of guidelines to be worked around cleverly so people don't get too mad at you.
---
DKP encourages the opposite of communication. You want to obfuscate what you have and want so you can get as much as possible for yourself.
---
**If you like DKP, I suggest your guild do Gold Runs instead.** Then the players who want to get gear faster and pay everyone else for the right to, and all the other players can benefit from it, and in turn benefit the raid.
---
One strath run will get you a good 14 plus bars of xp since I did the same being rested xp. 59-60 was  faster than 1-10 for me.  You will ding in like 2-3 hours total with one good run in there.
---
Undeads are the most cringe no matter the class.
---
Well first of all are you horde? Because alliance doesnt raid with 2h its not good without windfury.
---
But yeah even for pve it matters on horde since you fish for windfury all the time with hamstring and bigger wf proccs = more dmg and more rage gain.
---
I bet it's a performance tradeoff. Part of what's allowing them to keep so many people on a server.
---
My bad
---
You can't neccesary know that mate. 
---
There's 2 blue sets. One that's level 58, and one that's 60. These are two COMPLETLEY different sets,  but the 60 set replaced the 58 set in 1.12. So they can easily just release the 1.12 version of the lvl58 set. We don't know because it's not specified properly
---
very simple idea and perhaps its been said in the comments but make sure to kill all the mobs as you travel between quests.  most retail players are so used to linear questing where you just kinda went from A --&gt; B and did quests but in classic the best way is to kill stuff on the way
---
The loot rules should be discussed at the beginning of the raid.  Daggers are a 'spec' for rogues, just like holy vs. prot for palis or shadow vs. holy for priests, so the rules for rogues and daggers should mimic the rules for specs for other classes.  If all the paladins are rolling on tanking gear regardless of spec, then all the rogues should roll on the dagger regardless of spec.  If paladins are rolling for their spec, so should the rogues. (switch pali for resto/enh/elem for shammies if horde).
---
1 resist will get you killed and u have to start over
---
Depends on the dungeon, if they're that annoying just leave and find a new group, easy for a tank
---
Laughs in engineering.
---
That's the same conclusion i reached on my warrior after comparing cleaving SM/ZF versus just grinding and questing. The effective XP/hour is higher, sure. But the time you spend looking for a group, waiting for people who travel, die because people try to run it as fast as possible, and all the other issues you run into really eats into the effective rate, making it very comparable while being incredibly boring.
---
Haha can’t have the trinkets because they’re to powerful but we released dungeon gear in 1.12 form. These guys are silly.
---
Savage gladiator chest. It’s the only item I have left. It’s just miserable to farm. 
---
I have to tank BRD and fill my group with level 53 hunters and shamans who do trash DPS and aggro a bunch of extra shit. Usually impossible to find a healer for just arena runs (I don’t blame them, nothing for them unless it’s a shadow priest who wants the sash off-spec healing), so you end up going to Golem lord and taking 3x as long per run. 
---
Fortunately I got HoJ yesterday, so I’m going to start trying to reserve savage glad chain and see if I can’t fill a group with rogues who want HoJ.
---
&gt;PvE servers get shit on, everyone says PvP is the real experience
---
I've never read nor heard this from anyone, ever. I've never played on a PvP server.
---
Yeah but warlock ramps up a lot from lvl 30 on when you can start draintanking. Until then it's pretty meh
---
The problem is that the hardcore nerds are going to get rank 14 and access to some really OP gear.  Gear that you will never have access to unless you start playing 16 hours per day.
---
I had a group of 4 cleave warriors and me a Paladin holy 👌👌👌 dream team 
---
No mages
---
It matters less for pve though for sure
---
Pummelers are for threat gen. If you're doing progression bosses you still Wana be in heavy mitigation gear.
---
Even more casual players will be able to get a lot of their blue PvP set, and unless they've been clearing MC since week 1 or 2, they're sure to get some upgrades, and even if they have, the PvP gear is the best gear most casual players will have for PvP until they've been clearing BWL for a couple of weeks. They have a massive incentive to kill that innocent level 48 every single time they see him.
---
TradeSkillMaster has a crafting menu that will list all the materials you need to craft stuff
---
So many bag slots about to free up........
---
how do you use in game chat channels to find a guild?
---
You're gonna get smoked, but it's mostly going to be at instances and flight paths. Just deal with that and you can always go find a safe spot to grind or quest afterwards. 
---
The PvE reroll idea isn't bad either. I'll probably roll an alt on a PvE server to just kind of chill out and do quests I couldn't deal with in a war zone.  Also, and this is anecdotal...people seem nicer on PvE servers so it's much more chill.
---
Ehhhhh........you're not going to be able to shift loot systems that easily without pissing off a lot of players. Most people who join a DKP guild probably WANT a DKP loot system. People who prefer a loot council system will avoid you.
---
And if you don't tell recruits when they join that you're going to shift loot systems at X point, it's actually quite shitty of you. If my guild did that without a majority vote of the raid team, I'd stop trusting the leadership.
---
Thank you, I can do BRD runs for Golem and the Angerforge trinket. 
---
I'll look into edgemasters, I just actually heard about those this week. I'm a Tauren, should i stick with Mirah's? is thre a list of better weapons if not human?
---
Workshop key for Gnomeregan, Druids appreciate it.
---
oh my lord, was about to comment on the use of cringe  
---
but this was legitimately hard to sit through
---
On our server, the runecloth bag recipe is about 30g while all the rest are barely above vendor value. You can get the chest enchant for about 2 gold, the boots are basically worthless, too.
---
I know getting ganked sucks... but everyone thinks it sucks. Therefore you will have sympathetic people in the world to help you. That's what a pvp server is all about. You may get jumped at the Dire Maul entrance, but if you call for help you'll end up (most of the time) having an impromptu 10v10 wpvp battle. It forces communication within zones and adds more depth to the game outside of PvE servers. My advice would be to hit 60 and don't be pussy footing around on two characters and end up with two lvl 48s when Phase 2 drops.
---
Only humans. Any other rogue is free roll with warriors.
---
Shadowcraft is bis for humans but no other race
---
&gt;  Just make it so you can fish in higher difficulty waters?
---
No, you can't fish new areas that higher than your skill using lures.  
---
They just decrease chance for fish to "run away".
---
Cool thanks, os that chromatic breastplate really hard to get? I was looking at that this morning but wasnt sure
---
&gt; Sorry, I just had a horrible 5h brd run with dozent of wipes cause someone always had to peak around the corner and pull a pat while priest was drinking, just to jump around and pull the next one.
---
Lol if you waste 5 hours in BRD with such a group then the joke's on you my friend
---
More than one add per warrior is possible
---
I've always wondered about this. For years! When I was a kid I thought it meant they had a fear of the air or something but to even the flying ones still say it.
---
Soul stones
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA 
---
Ashbringer community on horde is garbage. I am glad it is good on alliance at least
---
Human swords rogue? Just go for wyrmhide shoulders from strat. Only thing is those also took me like 20-25 runs to get
---
I think we're gonna start using a dkp system that starts you at 100, you spend 20 per item, earn 20 per raid, can never go below 0, and doesn't include weapons. Gear/set pieces are on this system, so you roll against someone who has 100 and u have 80, it goes to the 100 guy and he drops to 80, so next item you both roll to see who gets it, that person then drops to 60. Weapons are on a roll/round robin system to avoid the obvious issues. We'll see how it goes.
---
&gt;  easy money 😂 
---
\*Bizzarro flame intensifies\*
---
Is there a reason you chose not to reply to this specific comment /u/QueenSpicy ?
---
That's 100% true haha
---
There's a rhythm and flow to every group, always dictated by Tank competency and the healers mana pool/ability.
---
Yesterday we did a Strat Live run, the tank was a geared MT, Quel'serar, Drill Borer disk, Wrath Helmet and pants, the works. He was FLYING through that instance, I was popping mana gems and evocation just so I didn't get outpaced. He stopped to let us rest after a pull twice the entire instance. It was fucking awesome. Our healer was a buddy of mine, decently pre-raid geared shaman. He was struggling to keep up, constantly around \~30% mana. We did the entire instance fine, with only one wipe on a big pull.
---
Our warlock was constantly bitching about heals. Because he was life tapping constantly to \~10% health, or using Hellfire. "Where are the heals at" "I didn't even tap that time" "Healer needs to keep me up for dps" "Good healers know dps is important"
---
The tank, who hadn't said a word for 30 minutes, while he's got 6 mobs on him, just chimes in with  "Heals fine, keep up"
---
And we blasted that instance in like 45 minutes time. The tanks last words to us were "Sorry gtg, bathroom calls"
---
did you take the bow?
---
Don’t worry mate, people will be doing MC for months and months and months. Even when BWL is on farm, people will still go through MC. People will start doing alt runs too!
---
I really wouldn’t worry about it and just enjoy the game. I’ve joined a guild that clears MC and Ony in one night and then one other night we do Ony again. So basically I have to plan two evenings a week that I’m home. I’m sure you’ll be able to find a guild like that when you hit 60.
---
Compromises are small and make very little difference?  This is dishonest at best.  Or ignorant...  Power levels with 1.12 itemization and talents is vastly different than vanilla, poor implementation of spell batching.   Now they've changed how groups of mobs aggro and leash.    A lot of things are way different from vanilla. We're already living in a world with changes.
---
That seems more or less reasonable. Have you noticed any campers at Qia? Or is your server population low enough that it's already been saturated with the patterns?
---
They could, sure but LC leaves open huge chances for bullshit and drama that wrecks guilds. LC can be done well but it often isn't.
---
Couple enchanting questions
---
I’ve been Disenchanting various greens and I’m wondering where I should store all the materials I get that I’m not using right away.
---
Also, is there some sort of add on that tells me if I should vendor, disenchant, or ah each item?  I don’t wanna disenchant EVERYTHING but I’m not sure what to sell and what not to.
---
It depends on the MC. Is this a pug MC, or a guild one? Is there already a dagger spec rogue who's said he wants to constantly go dagger? Have any rogues already won swords from MC/Onyxia at this point? 
---
There's no easy answer to this, and every guild is different. I'd prefer to give it to the dagger rogue if he's made it clear that's what he wants. We've got one in our guild that's been farming for Felstriker, so I'd definitely want him to get priority on a dagger if it drops, but I'd also expect that same rogue to NOT be rolling on MC swords if rogues/warriors need them. It's a trade-off. You can't have it both ways.
---
Right, maybe just not enough time to let it sink in?
---
Alliance transferring off in masses is what has largely caused the faction imbalance on most servers.
---
Herod, for example, was fairly even split (~60:40 and about 55:45 at 60 which is basically even). Then, the census addon data came out with the free server transfers and next thing you knew Alliance started leaving in hoards all because they saw Horde had just a teeny population majority, which then caused the faction balance to snowball and now Herod is estimated to be about 70:30 with most other High-pop servers being similar.
---
So now we have most PVP servers being huge horde majority and like 1 or 2 medium pop servers being huge Alliance majority due to all the Alliance exodusing to those servers.
---
Yeah I was basically tanking magmadar in full cat gear last night, but healers are geared plus with DM buffs it's hard to die.
---
Banishes are big on trash and on Garr, so make sure your UI allows you to easily track the timer for re-banishing.
---
Well, you come and ask for advice, then you say you wont do that because of reasons (?)  
---
So you basically say, i want advice, but im not following that advice.  
---
So i say, you wont find a guild then, so good luck.
---
You just need to change your expectations a bit. 
---
Stop trying to keep up with the hardcore gamers, normal players like you and I will never be able to keep pace. 
---
There are plenty of us out here enjoying the game at our pace.  I stopped caring what the hardcore guys are doing long ago. Don’t get me wrong I enjoy watching what they do but I no longer compare my pace to theirs.
---
I haven’t heard of this. Do you have a source?
---
I'm releveling because some of the items are Bind on Pickup so if you want everything, you have to level engeneering twice.
---
Thanks amigo, this is the route I’ve been trying to do!
---
Yeah, pressing Sinister Strike and Slice and Dice is more exciting.
---
You know what a true noob is? Someone who chooses to stay in a group they refuse to adapt to. Idk how many groups I see people argue and the truth is they both were playing shitty in their own way with either lack of awareness or knowledge of game mechanics.
---
You only have to wait an hour if you just mail them from an alt...
---
I set *Interact with target* to MW up and MW down when I try to buy stuff from her.
---
Yeah I just meant that’s a hassle to most people when the biggest thing is goblin jumper cables XL
---
Druid tank is amazing. Itemization for Druid is horrible. Your pre-raid bis is for the most part your actual bis. Some items you can get now are your bis throughout all phases...
---
I think once everyone gets better equip it’s going to be difficult to keep up with threat generation.
---
I want to find a troll only guild in Fairbanks
---
I mean, the picture literally shows 8 keys.
---
With massive use of consumables, including flasks, and world/DM buffs, I think it could be possible. Be fun anyway. 40 grounding totems dropped on cool down would be fun to see.
---
I need to do this!!
---
I have all the keys collectable right now, but unless I'm tapped for something as I'm sitting in IF, and even when I am, I quickly forget that I need to grab my Skeleton Key, or a Crescent Key. My 8 bank slots and all future group members should thank Blizzard.
---
Sac voidy as fast as you can. We warriors don’t get rage attacking you when your shield is up.
---
Dots come second.  Then kite as much as possible. If/when you are hamstrung, fake cast a shadowbolt to draw out a pummel (make sure to cancel the cast after about 0.5 seconds). Then just use life drain.
---
When you get death coil and shadow burn you have a much better chance. Pre 50 we can kill you before you kill us but then often die to the dots after combat. Having soulstone up will give you the last laugh.
---
Also priests do much better against warriors 40+ as shadowform is a counter to physical dps. Power word shield is also exceptional here against warriors.
---
Killin Rag pre suns was easy af even in Vanilla. 
---
Vael isn't just a DPS race, its a threat fight. You get max rage max mana, but if your tank can't pump the threat you can't use the DPS to burn the boss. You end up needing multiple tanks and having to stay below them all on threat if your MT threat and DPS isn't good enough to burn it fast enough. Having to stay below the off tanks ends up severely limiting the DPS you can pump out, and the raid is getting ravaged by fire the whole time. 
---
Rag is a huge joke compared to Vael.
---
Is it worth starting classic now?
---
I raid on retail but I wanna take a break and just enjoy classic. I doubt I will ever get to a point where I will raid, but I will most likely hunt for some pre-raid bis at 60 if I ever get there.
---
Does my class matter that much?
---
I'm planning rolling shadow priest but I don't know how this will affect me grouping up with people for dungeons and if its even viable to play at 60.
---
Classic wow is a game that requires a lot of your time, if you don't have that time it may just not be for you. 
---
But, you're not alone having a limited time to play. If you want to truly enjoy Classic, the way I believe you want to play it, you must find players with the same schedule as you, or a guild that have planned dungeons and raids that suits you.
---
Yea I hate that people don't run dungeons that don't give them a piece of BIS... makes running certain things impossible to get a group for if there isn't much BIS for a certain role. I don't blame them or anything, but still just miss running a dungeon for the hell of it and seeing what you would get.
---
Also, I hate that BIS lists usually only have 1 or 2 options. The bow from scholo wasn't on any BIS lists, but its just as much dps as the Xbows (I know its slower, still a good upgrade). I feel like people miss out on gear that would still be an upgrade for them by only looking for the very best of the best from BIS lists. 
---
And I agree everyone overgears for everything, and I really don't think that is necessary. I had like 2 pre-raid bis items before running MC for the first time, the rest greens. We cleared up to Domo with minimal issues and had to stop because it was pretty late (we started late). I was middle of the pack DPS with no consumables or anything.
---
Source is playing classic is like playing after drinking two bottles of vodka. It's hands down the worst part about classic by a metric fuckton. 
---
I wonder what on earth they were smoking when they decided 400 fucking ms was needed.
---
This is the answer.
---
I’m stuck at 42 as a healing priest...
---
ZF and Ulda have no gear for me and I’ve been dungeon leveling since RFC so I’m a bit lost on where to pick up at
---
Ony Attunement starts in Kargath - you'll want to start this as soon as you can.  It's a pain in the ass, it requires multiple runs through UBRS so as soon as you can start on it.  The MC Attunement is quite easy by comparison, there is a guy outside BRD and you talk to him, do a run into BRD past The Seven (can also do a lava run if someone knows) and collect the quest item.
---
After attunes, I'd start looking at pre-raid BiS gear and start running those dungeons as soon as you can.  BRD you can run the full thing right now likely, LBRS/UBRS/Scholo/Strat/etc you'll need to be 58+ but might be hard to find a group.  Personally after I hit 54 or so, I ran BRD til ~58 then quested to 60 simply because people often wont take 58/59 players into those dungeons.
---
bg finder was brought in during WOTLK pretty sure so no
---
Join a guild where you enjoy playing with them, you make gold from dungeons so everything is worth doing if you actually enjoy your class. I know my BiS gear but I'm still getting gear prior to that which is an upgrade while I'm doing some other dungeon. I for one appreciate that people actually know what they're doing. I mean shit most of my groups still manage to wipe somehow in every dungeon from something stupid anyways.
---
I learned this a long time ago with Golf. You are going to run into slow people who do not let you by. Learn to focus on relaxing rather than the pace you're going and you'll enjoy yourself a lot more and play better.
---
Welcome to 400MS spell batching.
---
Would you rather have a raid full of people who just "can clear the content" or who do it well + are dedicated to make an effort?
---
Of course you can freeroll through stuff in games like Classic but I just have never understood this kind of attitude since I always try to do my best no matter how easy or hard it might be.
---
It is, the regular horse is also better because it's not classed as a holy spell and doesn't cost mana (and reset your ooc mana regen).  You can also mount while silenced with a regular horse.
---
Lemme count: 
---
Scolo

Scarlet

Key to the city

Gnomeregan

Searing Gorge?

Shadowforge
---
Dire Maul

Not sure if all of these can go to keychain though (pretty sure Mara scepter and seal dont)
---
It only happens when you send to a stranger. No on friends list guild or your own account.
---
Then why did you present (and argue) as if it was an established truth? You know, something that is actually supported by actual arguments.
---
Raids arent going to stop when P2 hits.
---
You will be fine, just try and get as close 2 60 as you can before the 12th.
---
Just because you don’t know what it means doesn’t mean everyone else is lost too. The first patch is phase 2.

Really cool with these community events, keep it up!

Here too, older folks have had to use PCs for business applications for a long time, also you have your people who were in their 30s in the 80s who just love tech and games and got in early. My step dad is about to turn 71 and last year he built an entire VR room in his house all on his own. I bet he's better with PCs than your average 20 year old.

Inefficient and scarce

Wait we aren't getting the insignias? Were they not introduced with the honor system?

Gonna have to second this. You really need to just relax. P2 isn’t even adding anything that will change anything in terms of current raiding. There is literally zero reason to delay it and you could have theoretically had P2 added in with launch. You’re months from BWL. There is no such thing as “P1 raiding.”
---
hahaha lol xD so funneh
---
Stop caring about how other people progress. We with a job and school just can't race with the nolifers. I am only 45 lol (and the guild I am in is completely dead too, nobody has been online in 20+ days (our highest level was 48), it was a fun little guild while it lasted but it just shows how easily people give up on Classic).

If you just attack Qia without killing her a guard will spawn that can reach the safespotters. Just be sure to take off your gear first to avoid durability damage.
---
Also, report the safespotters.

I have 50/50 experiences with mages. Saturday night asked a mage (while huge pvp im tm was breaking out) if he would sell me a couple stacks of water. Took him 10 minutes to respond (even when things were settled) and he demanded GIVE ME GOLD. Even though I told him what I'd give him in whispers. I put up a gold for a couple stacks to get by, he put up 1 stack, I removed the gold and put up 50s, this jackass put up 9 waters. My raid group then picked up a mage who instantly starting waterboyin it up, handing out water and was literally the hero of the fight. He made some good bank there while having fun pvping. The other mage, decided to try to call my guild shitties, even though we were the main source of kills and leading the battle, because we wouldnt go deep into southshore to kill quest givers ( f wiping because 10000000 guards spawn). We tried to merge raid groups, I got in I asked for assist to bring my raid over. This guy declares (NO ONE FROM X GUILD)  I laugh at him and leave. Another of his guildie apologizes profusely. We then the large of the force met up in TM and all hearthed right in front of them and wished them luck. They were then over ran by the alliance. 
---
  Next day I whispered a mage in uc for some water (never whisper but only 2 mages in uc at the time) I asked how much for 6 stacks. 1G flat rate as much water as I want. Paid him 3g and thanked him for not being a prick.
---
I actually felt this a bit last night. Was doing UBRS for first time as a 59 rogue and we had a 9 man and absolutely rolled red/rend. Granted we had one rogue who was fucking stacked so dps was elite. But I just remember seeing that dragon and tend and being like, “Oh shit I’m gonna die!”
---
We melted everything and didn’t CC anything at all. I’m not sure how to feel
---
Gnome mage here. While levelling I try to aggressively out tag anyone but it’s deffinetly most fun when a warlock has dots up.
---
Can confirm Gandling as a good choice.
---
Alive server with queues only on certain days and times. 
---
If you want to have a jam-packed server Gehennas is your choice. Bonus if you are Scandinavian, they all seem to gather up there.
---
Not to mention summoning so everyone doesn't have to run themselves out to Dustwallow (though admittedly its easier for Horde than Alliance) and wipe insurance with SS.
---
1.5% actually so 2% is good.
---
Yeah and if you are orc i would suggest the BRD axe as prebis. Dreadforge Retaliator
---
&gt; Blizz can merge servers as they please.
---
This isn’t really true. On retail they don’t even do this, they just link two realms together instead of actually truly mergin the realm. Think about all the guild names and character names that would conflict.
---
I’m 99% sure Silithus didn’t have quests in beginning Vanilla, so same deal here.
---
That explains why the tank is dead.
---
fun.
---
Arcanite reaper is better but not worth with these prices.
---
Grandparent could have been in their late 30's or early 40's, not too old for WoW or to be net savvy really.
---
Well that means that you get the powerful PVP gear instead of the weaker gear.
---
Go and look at both PVP gears there are (in Atlas Loot of Wowhead) and then decide yourself which one is the strong one.
---
The one you picked is most likely right
---
I'd agree with this, it's all perception and not reality. I'm also a warrior, so didn't see any bears while leveling, but my experience at 60 has been that they're better than warrior tanks at basically everything except raid bosses. I'm actually leveling a druid tank as my second 60 just because they're so amazing for 5 and 10 man dungeons, and I don't really plan on running any raids with him.
---
I think you misread one of the previous comments. Yes, these are BiS for warriors... but also for rogues. OPs point that rogues might be supposed to greed on some leather items in favour of warriors does not make any sense. There are no such items that rogues wouldn't, **and shouldn't** need on, because they are BiS no matter who gets them.
---
Nobody insisted on 400MS
---
He should also dispel the mage. It’s dispel and cast feedback, dot, then do whatever you can to proc blackout.
---
Keeping up shield is also very useful.
---
Just never cast a mind blast/flay when a mage is targeting you (the priest) and has counter spell ready unless you fake it first.
---
Demonshear if you are non-orc
---
Cringe you’re so cringy
---
Log in and play.
---
You really don't get much benefit from full holy.  21 holy gets you 95% of the benefit of the whole tree - pretty much all you lose that matters is 5% crit.  5% crit is nice, but not necessary for mc/ony etc.
---
So your telling me you were offered a transfer chose not to take it and it’s blizzards fault you didn’t jump realms. Ha come on man you expect them to cater to every stubborn guild like yours. Be realistic. The only people you have to be mad at is your own selves.  We were on thalnos half our guild couldn’t play because of ques it became logical to jump ship at this point you chose to stick it out through ques for who knows how long and now your mad your full server is full.
---
30 spell power is only damage, 55 healing is only healing.
---
True. But for me I play whatever class I like no matter if it's harder to get a spot in raid or loot.
---
And the set bonuses all seem designed for the one spec no one ever plays, without addressing what that spec is actually lacking.
---
Easier to pug Ony than MC, but the MC attunement is a simple pick up quest whereas the Ony attunement is something you should start on once you hit 55 and work you way thru while you progress through dungeons.
---
305 to 300 is 85% on glancing blows to 65%. The gains after 5% are much less significant, up to a max of 95% at the cap of 314 weapon skill.
---
Pallies can help with that. :)
---
This, everyone go dps so there won't be any tanks left
---
It is a colloquialism, friend.
---
Couldn't agree more. Ended up leaving and picking up retail after spending two solid months in this mind set. I got all my pre bis and then got a fair amount of good raid gear. Then all of a sudden I was like what the fuck am I doing. I did this all before the only difference is it was a surprise, now I'm following someone's spreadsheet. Retails actually not that bad, maybe cause it's all new to me. The dungeons seem harder, and my rotation is much more rewarding. Also the community is alot more firendly and less minmaxy.
---
STV is a playground for sociopaths. Still, I thought devising strategies to avoid getting killed there was kind of fun. Avoiding roads, moving in groups, constantly keeping a lookout etc.
---
If a server's faction balance gets too lopsided I can see how it could become a nightmare though.
---
God damn dude, that's cold. At least you feel bad about it though, shows you're a decent person.
---
There is an add-on called Gold Seller Blocker that i highly rate, and gives you a report button in the chat tab to flag the account.
---
Edgy kid in the white hat is probably in jail now for domestic violence
---
Yep, I think he misread it a bit. No matter who gets the leather items thar warriors want, they are BiS either way (i.e. For rogues as well).
---
If saving that dps is going to cause more problems than it will solve, then let them die.
---
If you feel like that dps is vital to the success of clearing the pull, then save them.
---
Just try and address any problems as they come up in chat first. Unless someone is a complete asshole,  they will at least try to adapt their playstyle to suit the group.
---
- Farm for rep. Pick a faction you want/need high rep with, find the mobs that give it, and farm those.
---
- Farm for money. Pick something that has good drop tables (eg bats in EPL, elementals) and earn xp and money.
---
There are, it's just that BiS is harder to know with Titanforging. You'll get situations where one pair of legs is better than another, but if the other pair is 15 ilevels higher than it might be better. It might also still be worse!
---
Classic pvp basically revolves around engineering lmao
---
Gaaaatoradeeeee
---
So we will see the Blue 60 sets for each class hit when 1.12 releases?
---
Spriest is mainly a pvp spec at 60.  Dungeons most people will prefer you to heal and it's doable even in shadow spec and in raids usually only 1 is brought.
---
I have always liked Aux. Used for years and has everything i need.
---
My body is ready.
---
the problem is wars roll on plate and chain and leather while rogues get leather. Prebis trumps doing the right thing in many players eyes which is sad since MC is a joke and generally the only thing that slows us down is enhance shamen and wars in prebis with no hit points getting wrecked over and over.
---
Stay at 305, I think there is still some use up till like 309? But after that it’s literally not worth it because of the DR on it.. you gain more from crit/agi/AP after 305.
---
For phase 2, anything beyond 6-7 will be quite a grind, but once BGs are out, anything up to 10 isn't that difficult
---
I’m not arguing whether or not someone thinks it counts as solo or not, just pointing out how obvious it is that a level 1 would need buffs to accomplish the feat.
---
Hateradeeeee
---
Nah. Maybe in horde only duels. Shadow guard can proc blackout, which is insane. Actually insane and op. You can win matchups you were otherwise going to lose out of nowhere. Alliance has less warlocks as well due to the prevalence of undead. 
---
Devouring plague is great flavor but pretty irrelevant.
---
For Warlocks on here who have a SM/Ruin build, what rotation of spells do you use in dungeons? I'm looking to increase my overall DPS. Right now i'm usually casting Curse of Agony, Corruption and Drain life in as many targets as possible (+ wand), and if needed rain of fire. I've seen some people use hellfire but not sure if I want to risk dying more frequently. Any reccomendations?
---
No surprise, Blizzard's design philosophy these days is "Minimize effort, maximize money".
---
This is where PvP comes in and keeps the game interesting.
---
Says the war or druid
---
Sitting in one spot for hours on end even after the lowbie you are ganking has disconnected, just in the hopes that he might reconnect so you can kill him again, sounds like a blast...

Yeh I have 1m of gameplay worth of footage to captivate audience and I can’t show extended outplays that’ll go over most peoples heads. Just the nature of trailers .

---
I have two 60s and a 46. you're just a whiny turd lmao.
---
But, but... AOE groups?! NEED! MOAR! AOE!
---
On a serious note, if you're max level, you're probably going to be running a lot of dungeons with people who did nothing *but* spam AOE groups all the way to 60. Expecting them to actually know how to play their classes outside of that really is a big ask.
---
You know, they say that it is more likely that you will die while driving to get a lottery ticket than winning the lottery itself. That's more accurate how it feels.
---
I too am this guy. Can't wait to get rid of all these keys.

So you want an option that involves zero looking at screen or interacting in any way?

You can either spend 100% of your time in WoW, 100% of your time watching TV, or some mixture of both
---
Humor is subjective not objective.
---
I always wondered what WoW would be like if everyone shouted their attack names like in anime.
---
Like a really, really, especially shitty load of rubbish.
---
&gt; Being level 55 has you ahead of a large number of people.
---
are we gonna still be saying shit like this in p3/p4 lol
---
Why would it only drop for one class? plenty of people farm the eye of shadow for priest benediction/anathema quest
---
That wasn't planned from the beginning though. Phase 2 was gonna be the first patch but the pushed DM out early.
---
May want to wait a bit because you need to buy the shadow spells to (Mind Flay)
---
Phase 2  
---
Points for honorable kills + 2 world bosses (even if you had 30hours a week to play, this isn't really going to affect you because they're on long CD timers, and it will be dominated by a few colluding guilds.)  
---
Phase 3  
---
BWL + Darkmoon  
---
This won't affect you. Majority of players are too bad to fully cleared BWL even with bis p2 gear.  
---
Phase 4  
---
ZG + world bosses.  
---
ZG is clearable, but it's so easy that you'll get carried through.  
---
The next phases don't affect you because you most likely will be unable to clear those raid tiers anyways.
---
The catch up gears are mostly useless (tier 0.5). So short of getting carried, there's not much change in the game for a casual from P2-P6. Only ZG.
---
It's all way too relative. You leveled too slow compared to those who farm MC. You leveled too fast compared to those whose level is lower than yours and trust me there are a lot of them. 
---
If it helps, I leveled within the first 2 weeks after launch, still was mocked for some of my guildmates by being slow and threw a tantrum at my supposed online friend who promised me to be my healer then decided not to play wow at the day of launch so I leveled warrior solo.
---
Neither have we, welcome to the cenarion circle
---
I’ve run prot tank and frost mage so far in my 2019 classic experience. This is my perspective:
---
Tanking was much more difficult for me. You basically can never slack off, and always have to be alert of everything that happens. I put my talents into extra threat, and always tried to use the best onehanded weapons I could find. I would stance dance. The threat was still too low for aoe.so I started using dual wield with with my sword and shield. Started generating twice as much rage. Still couldn’t compete with aoe aggro. Gave up at lvl 50 when my threat couldn’t keep up anymore even with my dps friends. 
---
I was just so tired of it. When I tanked, my neck would start to cramp up and my hands would get sore after a few hours of dungeon grinding. 
---
Then, I said fuck it I’m making a frost mage. Leveled up 10x as fast. And I knew how hard it was to tank so I did everything I could to make it easier on the tanks I worked with. But then I discovered something. The DPS warrior tank with 2H and whirlwind and or with the spin axe thing from SM. These warriors could command so much aggro and threat from just their dps, I could aoe blast with out pulling anyone. Made me realize how dumb I was for using sword and shield for all those hours on my first warrior. 
---
Then, I started coming across the tanks similar to me when I started, sword and shield with low ass aggro. As an aoe spec, I can safely kite teleport and then ice block if I need. I got really good at this bc I practiced for hours while leveling up. So when I come across these tanks, I communicate to them how he could work with me to help keep the mobs grouped up. You can’t take aggro of all them, but you can help bunch them together by snagging the ones furthest from the clump and walking with them as I kite. Tank will take less damage, healer doesn’t have to heal as much, and I do stupid aoe dps which speeds everything up. 
---
As you can imagine, not every tank is down with this all the time. As I said before tanking is exhausting. When they’re not down, I can still sit back and cast frostbolts instead. No need to be an asshole about it. 
---
But when slow ass entitled tanks who won’t let me build any aggro and then bitch and complain about how low the dps is when we wipe bc of him, I’ll force him to deal with my aoe, make his life harder, and show him how easy it is to just aoe and blow through groups. 
---
Side note, while dps warriors make better tanks, I’ve never actually reached lvl 60 or done raids. So I don’t know how well this holds up. And also, Druid tanks are also amazing at holding aoe threat compared to sword and shield warrior.
---
kids never expect the gnomish resto druid burst
---
I am not far from getting my own, looking forward to it a lot!
---
This is what I'm hoping for, people travelling all over to combat gank squads. Sadly I think we're going to get Flight Path, Dire Maul &amp; BRM corpse camping.

Honestly if you’re on Faerlina, you have no worries as a matter of fact you’re well taken cared of. With Asmons 8 hour camping Flightmasters and Asmons deathsquads rolling through azeroth Gonna be very fun for horde when we dont have anybody large enough to rally us together
---
For me it's always a smooth going run and someone says "we can probably pull faster" then the Benny hill music plays as I run around tanking by taunt just barely holding on until we wipe
---
xD
---
No....it’s being said now because it’s accurate. It will become less so as the game progresses.
---
You sound like a caveman who was just thawed, and told how money works. DKP encourages showing up on time, and doing your role -- it doesn't matter if you do it for selfish reasons or not, because the outcome is desirable.
---
Meanwhile LC is only better for progression, because to progress you need a collective effort. It's not relevant in Vanilla though, because there is no "progression" unless your guild blows. 
---
And here you are trying to make a case why a system deliberately designed to be arbitrary and unfair, is somehow less arbitrary and unfair than DKP.. makes no sense.
---
For real. My guild was becoming renowned for being fair with loot. And then they implemented loot council to "make sure the guild improves and not worry about people feeling left out."
---
Now you're either a part of the in-crowd who gets loot or hope something drops that no one else needs. It feels like crap, and I expect regulars to start dropping soon... And this is coming from one of the people who is given loot.
---
you could farm the elementals in northwest silithis. You will get exp and possibly essences for gold as well as hydraxian waterlords rep
---
Leveling my shaman now. Exciting to see some elemental game play.
---
You don't need pre bis, you want pre bis gear.
---
308 is where you no longer reduce damage reduction on glancing blows. Hit rate increase above 305 is negligible.
---
3 days well spent
---
Yeah wep skill doesn't scale as hard. You want to 305-310   weapon skill and 8% hit. After that crit scales dmg hardest. I have seen some rogues focus hard on hit over everything to get dmg out of white hits

#  &lt;Hope Rises&gt; | Relaxed “mediumcore” | You can raid with us just once per week for the life of Classic | Horde @ Herod
---
Positivity, loyalty, and freedom is what we're about. This is what that looks like to us:
---
• **We "officially” raid just once per week on Tuesdays (+50 wife points) starting in January 2020 so you can level enjoy the leveling process! (Those of us who are already 60 are already clearing MC on a weekly basis by working in guild collaborations)**
---
• 7:30-8 PM Central start time for raids in a relaxed environment; raids will last 3-4 hours as needed (we will "officially" begin raiding in January 2020, with unofficial PUGs filling in the time until then)
---
• Freedom to spec how you want (particularly early on in MC and BWL) so long as you are also willing to change to a more meta role when asked (probably way down the line — like AQ-40 to Naxx).
---
• Active round-the-clock guild with numerous casual members so there should always be guildies to level with at your own pace.
---
Though many of us have raided Mythics in retail, we are committed to enjoying each other’s company and the mostly laid-back nature of Vanilla endgame. If you are impatient, easily frustrated, or are seeking a “world-first” (lol), cutting-edge, every-world-buff-is-mandatory hardcore raiding experience, then our guild is not for you. If, however, you jive with our vision of Classic and would like to join the family, or would simply like more information, feel free to comment here, DM me on Discord (Oleon#2355), message me or another officer in the game (Oleon, Acer, Soapie), or pop by the guild Discord and introduce yourself in #General chat here: [https://discord.gg/HkDRhXY](https://discord.gg/HkDRhXY)

Wooooah, dude, levels, that’s hardcore. You’re a hardcore guy, man.

You’re either completely ignorant or a troll. Already done responding to you. Later.

Death roll's ftw.
---
&gt;That in reality will make zero different compared to spending time mastering game mechanics and becoming a better player.
---
This is 100% false. There is almost no "skill" involved with playing any class in Classic WoW. Everyone has a pretty set rotation, and that rotation is a maximum of 5 buttons, usually much less. If you're doing more damage than someone else, 90% of the time it's because your class is better than theirs, and the other 10% is because you're better geared than they are. The bosses of MC have one mechanic. Most dungeon bosses have no mechanics. The best way to show off player skill is by having your BiS and coming to raid prepped with consumables.

RP servers are fantastic. It’s like a totally different game just from the atmosphere of the community

1. Protect your healer at all costs.

Is demonshear always better than Treant’s Bane in both PvE and PvP scenario ? ( those are the only two weapons I think I can get with reasonable effort before big raid dungeon)

Yea he gets chunked hard but it let's you cheese logs a little harder lol
---
I have done some calculations on the healing output of HW and CH on the 3 targets:
---
HW rank 9 (with 300 healing and Healing Way bonus):
---
Target 1: Healed for on avg. 2232
---
Target 2: Healed for on avg. 2232-0.8*2232=446
---
Target 3: Healed for on avg. 446-0.8*446=89
---
CH rank 3 (with 300 healing):
---
Target 1: Healed for on avg. 881
---
Target 2: Healed for on avg. 0.5*1076=440
---
Target 3: Healed for on avg. 0.5*440=220
---
It would seem that CH is still better if the first target does not need heavy healing.
---
Mana efficiency wise I have estimated the cost of HW9 to be 424 mana which gives a healing per mana HPM of 6.52 (taking into account the 3 chances of proccing the tier bonus)
---
For CH3 it costs 385 mana which gives a HPM of 4.
---
If only the raw healing output is the goal, Healing Wave is more mana efficient with 8/8 t1.
---
...did you reconnect?

AOE grinding/farming is fine and all, just don't be a prick about it. Do it somewhere where people aren't trying to quest off those same mobs.

Rough but still able to attempt, unlike Gnomes since no heals = instant death

Falling behind is not necessarily a bad thing. Price of mats and rare pattern/formulas have dropped significantly. Dungeon runs are smooth as people got more familiar with it. Even pugging Onyxia and MC can get you to full clear
---
YOU CAN /MOON people?!?!?
---
It’s a balancing act for sure if your target is 63 (boss level) I wouldn’t have under 6% miss. If it’s under you can get away with less.

You won’t be generating threat if you can’t hit.

Doesn't stop some asshole from doing it.  Made doing City raids not worth it unfortunately.

Momma says Mages are the devil.
---
MP5 gear will almost certainly reduce your healing output compared to +healing gear.
---
The key is to remember that healers work in *teams* in Classic. You're not just mindlessly spamming heals like in Retail.
---
That means you need to not only understand your class, but also the other two healing classes (in this case, Priests and Druids).
---
On the Horde-side, the breakdown tends to go:  
---
**Priests**. Cast-cancel large heals on tanks, Prayer of Healing when heavy raid damage is affecting their entire group.  
---
**Shaman**. Spam heavily downranked Healing Wave on the tank (let the Priests respond to surges of damage with the big heals). Chain Heal on melee (normally the Shaman in the melee group, the tank or a Rogue as the primary target).  
---
**Druid**. Spec for Nature's Grace and roll Regrowths for spot-healing.
---
This changes depending on the fight. For example, on Geddon, your Priests will be spending a lot more time on Dispels so you'll need to ramp up your tank healing a bit. However, you should generally never be throwing more than Chain Heal (Rank 1) or Healing Wave (Rank 3) except in unusual circumstances.
---
As your guild gears up, Shaman tend to specialize as well. You send T2 to the Elemental/Enhancement Shaman while deep Resto Shaman grab the T1 set bonuses - while the armor itself isn't all that great, the 5- and 8- set bonuses are fantastic.
---
I misread the text as you already had a female virgin child and thought to myself why on earth does a grown man behave like this. Reread and realised you’re just a kid.
---
Good job man, time well spent. Proud of u, gg.
---
Auctionator shows a tooltip on each item with the vendor value,  market value (AH), and estimated enchanting value.  Use this in combination with a bank alt (create a new toon,  level them to 5, train enchanting,  then just park them in a major city and mail everything you don't vendor to them to either disenchant or sell on the AH).
---
Just max out your lockpicking/engineering scrubs.
---
They told us we get progressive itemization, which suggest 58 set, but they also said 1.12 version which suggests 60 set.
---
Haha I'm in the exact same situation with uni and work, only level 53 now. Currently trying my  best to get to 60 before pvp releases. Yeah it sucks seeing 60s running around in full epics by now but my friends in that situation say the game is boring now and that classic is more about the journey than the destination
---
Let's jam
---
does your healer let you die when you he notices you pick a suboptimal threat skill, or when you communicate suboptimally?
---
no?
---
maybe you should focus on your own improvement / adaptation in such a case, instead of this passive aggressive "teach a lesson" shit
---
I wonder if you are the type of person that breaks their items and walks down mid in league/dota the moment you are upset with a teammate.
---
Those are blackrock orcs i think (not sure). So they are probably hostile.
---
Tranq shot is definitely not a need in MC.
---
"large number of people" is accurate.
---
Most people that play regularly are probably at 60.  But I'd say 30-40 percent of players who play at least 2 times a week are still leveling.  That's a "large number of people" you're ahead of if you're at 55.
---
Look, you and I are at 60, but chill a bit ok.
---
Who gives a flying f
---
Your definition of "patch" does match the majority's understood definition.
---
I leveled up as Assassination backstab spec. Gouge is really, really good
---
Try to count how long it takes to kill 1 mob. Dots are not effective if they are on the target for their full duration (or close to). Usually mobs i dungeons die in 10 seconds, making dots a waste of time, mana, and possibly pulling aggro.
---
The good gnomish items are bop
---
Alliance can wall jump behind UC to get to SM.
---
Follow the lake (by Dalaran) and when you hit UC (the tower touching the mountain) you can wall jump where it meets the terrain (Night Elves might be too large to fit through the gap at the top)
---
Once behind, you can run up the mountain and jump down past UC, skipping the Horde zepp, guards, enemy faction, and the entrance to UC.
---
I never said it wasn't
---
Looking at the first few, there were def things like easier access to the instance, shorter corpse run, things like buffs and mobs despawn after a wipe or mobs quit spawning after a boss kill, etc.
---
I have the Spy add on and originally was going to try and add people to a list on there but honestly on PVP servers it's such a shit show with people that I have decided to just go "Red is Dead" because of the way I was treated leveling. 
---
I know detractors from this say that is perpetuating the cycle, blah blah blah - but don't care.  If I land in Ratchet and I see a level 20 run by, they get a nice DoT that will kill them.  Everyone red is fair game and KoS.
---
I do tend to hold back if I am trying to accomplish something - like if I am farming.  When doing something like that I'll show restraint and essentially not engage unless first engaged myself.
---
I used to love mind controlling people in vanilla and then buffing them. This time around people freak out when they see a priest casting MC, even when not near the lava in BRM.
---
Killing a player more than 5 levels below you,  or certain enemy npc's (quest givers and flight masters I believe). Won't show up until phase 2
---
You absolutely can.
---
A year, sure. There are a lot of phases, and most players will not be done with Naxx in a year. Gearing up often takes some time, so even when a dungeon is on farm, most folks are not done with it for a good while. Plus, some of the really intense folks do alts. 
---
So, a year is totally fine without an update.   
---
Eventually it would be nice to have an expansion, though. But I want the level cap to stay the same, and I don't want earlier content invalidated. Plus, no flying mounts, etc. I believe there is space for a lot of alternative spec/sidegrade gearing in particular, as well as unusual trinkets, etc. I think you could do an entire expansion only introducing say, one additional tier of gear, but a lot of additional options.
---
No reason to be salty at warriors. It is not our fault that Blizzard for some reason chose not to put a single pair of DPS plate shoulders in the game until BWL. In the meantime, other classes have tier, and in some cases dungeon sets that are sufficient. This is not "other classes loot", this is physical DPS loot.
---
Murlocs in Azshara in the Temple of Arkkoran. Prioritize the Pincers and Clackers because they have a higher drop rate for clams/golden pearls.
---
Kind of ironic you claim to find warlock repetitive yet tell us your exact rotation to kill mobs which will most likely never deviate
---
Get ur mage to 60 and stop slacking don’t make an alt at 40 bro wtf! Lol for real tho this is my best advice
---
STOP
---
HITTING
---
SHEEP!
---
What's the buff you put on yourself to make fireball hit so hard?
---
If you plan to tank the boss you just need to reach the DEF cap then stamina (easier heal) and damage (for aggro). That's pretty much all there is to tanking.
---
Tanking without being def capped is dangerous, if you get critted after a blow you're dead. Stamina is usually better than avoidance because you takes regular damage instead of nothing / nothing / surprise big hit and it generates more rage so more aggro
---
If it's cancer just quit...
---
I'm having fun but if it can't be as bad as people are saying.
---
That's not how statistics work. There is a difference between combinations and permutations.
---
The chances of this specific permutation (3-2-1) are much lower than "just any" set of numbers. From a selected subset of 3 out of 100 options, there are 970,200 different possible permutations. 
---
    nPr = (100!)/(100-3)! = 100!/97! = 970,200
---
The odds of 3-2-1 being rolled is 1 in 970,200, or ~0.000103%
---
There are far fewer combinations of any three numbers. 3 rolls in a set of 100 creates 161,700 combinations.
---
    nCr = 100!/3! x (100-3)! = 100!/3!97! = 161,700
---
The chances of rolling any other set of numbers is 1 in 161,700, or 0.000618%.
---
“Causing himself stress.” Lol. Yes I’m sure OP decided to be worried. How dare he wonder whether or not he made a bad decision and let’s definitely admonish him for seeking feedback. Good way to be a human.
---
I MT/OT MC at present - OT most fights on skull/X add, main tank Golemagg and Shazzrah for my superior mitigation on physical damage and higher overall health pool.
---
Currently I run around 19.6% dodge (so I can effectively mitigate 1 in 5 heavy hits from bosses such as Golemagg) - 5% hit - 9.6k armor (because of my spec) in a mix between pre-raid and raid BiS, with my own pieces swapped in based on my own knowledge. Don't follow 100% the guides on pre-raid BiS and talents, especially if you know your class enough to strike a balance. I see lots of druids roll in as an OT with zero cat talents in the 11/33/7 spec... Don't do this. This full tank spec is designed for you to take Hateful Strikes from Patchwerk and provide little to no raid utility otherwise, Skarms videos are for a private server classic experience where Naxx is a thing and fights require a max load of 16k Armor... the content we have in current classic are not these fights.
---
If you're running 0/30/21 for decurse or offheal because your guild is short on healers then great, make sure to carry your full fire resist set and your entire healing set in your bags with you. But if you have enough dedicated healers and mages to cover your raid you are better off rolling into cat talents and providing DPS 3% Crit from Leader of the Pack in the melee group. I personally run 11/33/7 with only 1/5 Thick Hide (leaving 8% armor on the table so I can take a little more damage and generate rage) and picking up my cat talents so I'm useful doing DPS and adding a buff to the DPS in fights where I'm either not tanking, or tanking an add and them swapping to DPS on boss after my add is killed. You can't change your gear mid-fight so 0/30/21 is useless unless you aren't tanking at all and can start the fight in resto gear.
---
If you want clarification for anything I've said or have more questions please feel free to reply here and I will answer them as I can.
---
I've seen plenty of dumbass hunters still, but yeah I still more or less agree with what you said.
---
2 off tanks and a main tank.
---
Count yourself lucky, I’ll never afford an epic mount because my hunter pet eats 3 Kodo’s a day.
---
Very common thing if u wanna pvp afaik. Gnomish items u usually only need to be crafted once. While govlin items like nades and sapper charges needs to be refilled often.
---
&gt; Complained in guild chat and 10 seconds later there it was.
---
nice
---
btw this works for quest drops too in my experience lol
---
Yeah - that guy is just stupid.  I give it three kills and then I am graveyard rezzing and going somewhere else.
---
Hands of power in LBRS. In like 20 runs I haven't seen him drop anything else but his shitty footlocker.
---
Also the obvious Drakestone of Frozen Wrath, only did 30 runs for that though.
---
Honestly it's pretty damn close to the way it was. Layering is necessary for many reasons and it's been covered to death for those that can't think for themselves. Batching and spells feeling clunky feels just right. I'm really happy I get to play it again.
---
Practically none of your prebis tanking gear (or even healing gear) is gonna come from pre-brd so relatively speaking, you're not 'geared' for either role. So just keep on healing while collecting both tank and he gear from dungeons. Respec when you feel you are geared enough.
---
Level 45 druid with hybrid HotW/NS spec planned for tanking/healing at 60.
---
Right now I have 5 furor, 5 HotW, and I just picked up LotP when I dinged 45.
---
Two questions: What level should I respec and get rid of the cat dps talents I have for leveling? And when I respec should I definitely go 30/21/NS if I plan on healing, or can I go 31/20/LotP if I plan on OT raiding? I've found a solid guild that will let me attempt OT raiding as their feral once I hit 60 and am geared. I expect to be 60 in about 2 weeks or so hopefully. 
---
Thanks in advance for any advice!
---
Yeah, that's what he said.
---
the thing is that it doesn't actually maximize your dps to have mobs in your dead zone hitting you. like would you rather use your aoe stuff right away and then not be able to aoe efficiently for 90% of the pull, or wait 20% of the pull and aoe efficiently for 80% of the pull. it should be obvious which is better dps.
---
The spell ID did not work - I had to go this route.
---
what has this trailer to do with Phase 2 ?
---
Hmmmmm I'm going to look into that. I love LOVE Healbot, but it's raid options are lacking.
---
Did it yesterday as a lock, some of the ogres (most) will be passive and ignore you but not friendly. The hunter gave me 1 invis pot for the bottom near the 3rd guard and he used pet to aggro the pair of guards through the gate and we ran by and got king buff before they chased us down
---
Vanilla was all about number crunching.
---
Classic feels like facerolling and following guides.  It's fun, though.  =)
---
Shadow priest isn't very engaging, mainly just shield, mb, swp then wand till death. It's safe, but probably boring for you. 
---
Some options are keep with your mage and use the AoE spec which is a lot more engaging and dangerous but with bigger payout. Or you could try Hunter or Warlock. Both can be dull and easy with pet tanks, but you can also solo elite quests (or just higher level quests in general) which can be challenging.
---
should be yes.
---
Is there a writeup of this sort of theory somewhere? I'd definitely do well to learn it!
---
U usually start with gnomish, relearn and stick with goblin.
---
I concur with this response. I am a dagger rogue myself, and made that clear to my guild when I was leveling pretty early on. So when I join their raid team I wouldn't expect to be able to roll, at priority, on any swords that dropped from the bosses.
---
sword of zeal too, which can be significantly cheaper
---
It's never too late and I highly recommend you respec now even if you're in int gear it'll be faster leveling.  You probably shouldn't tank in int gear but youll barley notice a difference in healing with hotw  vs moonglow so you can keep healing and collect some feral gear.  Even just agi/str/stam leather off the ah is fine
---
Can get u Banned
---
Yeah if you don't equip it immediately, then greed it. Idc if you have different sets, equip it so it's soulbound
---
Yes, I am sure. You can only do this if you have multiple accounts (one posting and one buying), or if you have a friend willing to be your mule.
---
contradict where?
---
My problem is that I can't exactly roll need on tank gear when I'm healing, so it's going to be impossible to get at this point, no? 
---
And yeah, I know it's not preBiS or BiS even but all of my current gear is all heavily geared towards healing was my point.
---
&gt; chill a bit ok.
---
its literally just an argument about population distribution
---
https://youtu.be/1yqVD0swvWU
---
Well you still have quite a few levels before 60, and you might have to do quite a few dungeon runs for pre BiS, so I'd say it's worth it(as tanks are always in demand)
---
I'm guessing you're not LW, so instead you can run some lower level dungeons for some starting stuff,maybe some cheap greens from AH, and then you're set up!
---
"used engineering to win, try hard"
---
"used consumable to win, try hard"
---
"Played an OP class, try hard"
---
I hate when people call someone better than them a try hard. Bro, try hards are always just people better than you or people who care enough to succeed.
---
Auctionator, however, usually makes mistakes in realms with low prices and you end up dumping if you don't notice
---
Well, maybe the majority doesn't understand what a patch is.
---
Great, just as I hit 49. Just... Great.
---
Yeah... personally I don’t expect bwl till march at the earliest. Complete guess but we need time in mc.
---
Why is there corruption in every industry? Why do we have laws, when we could have a council handle judicial matters, like they did 1000 years ago?
---
What an incredibly dumb fucking comment.
---
I was expecting it to be a bit much but I am undergeared and dont want to get carried too much so I wanted to make sure I was contributing the most I could my first couple MCs. After I get closer to preBis I wont bring all this
---
Shower shit and brush your teeth at the same time.
---
What counts as a dishonorable kill?
---
If you found it on Zandalar Tribe, Alliance, I'm in!
---
I remember a couple of twink priests at lvl 19 but they never seemed to be around for long. After a while though even I ended up levelling my druid and twinking it in each bracket, 20-29 was particularly fun having cat form with its speed boost talents.
---
It isn't, but it can definitely trigger suspensions apparently. We had someone get a 30 day because of how frequently the VPN at their work changed.
---
Part of the problem I've noticed is that melee in general dont realize that ranged need to constantly drink in between pulls especially if you expect them to perform on par or above you as a melee, and this is without even considering the healer. It's honestly a good change to the endless damage turrets that are ranged dps in retail, but it requires a degree of patience for melee for sure.
---
theres a tryhard guild on my server that tries to be as meta as possible and you are required to be tge mosr opt race/class to join.
---
pallys - dwarf
---
mages - gnome
---
priest - dwarf
---
lock - gnome
---
rogue - human
---
warrior - gnome
---
etc
---
As a current druid, how DARE you... be correct. Hey man give me 11 more seconds for this heal to go off, I'll show you! 
---
In all seriousness, I think Druid adds like 20 tiny things that don't obviously appear on meters, so it's tough to place an appropriate amount of value on them. In other words: how much faster do we kill a boss due to Faerie Fire? I have no idea. Would we have wiped if I didn't Innervate the priest? Probably not? Did that battle rez allow us to progress? Sure? Are the melee boys critting 3% more often because I'm a cat? Yes... but is that an overall DPS increase compared to just having another rogue/warrior instead? Ehhhh. 
---
All of these things COULD be determined with enough math, but that's exhausting. At the end of the day, physical damage dealers hit harder in feral groups, healers have more mana, everyone has extra stats, resist, and armor, etc. I think of us as similar to shaman: a force multiplier. The biggest "issue" is that you only need a few druids to multiply that force for the entire raid, and anything over that number doesn't add anything to the raid.
---
What's a computer?
---
2H Arms.  
---
Dont go DW without  +x%hit stat on items. ( you need atlest 6 to 9% for that)
---
Hunters have a total aggro drop. If the tank goes chasing after a mob that the hunter pulls, that's on the tank.
---
Despite what it seems like on Reddit, at least 90 percent of the player base is not even 60 yet. You're fine. Most people haven't had 18+ hours a week to play.
---
Some people like the whole RP part of the mmorpg. I know I play on PvP servers despite not liking killing people in the world because it makes it feel real. The interactions you have with the other faction also seem more meaningful when they have the option to ruin your day, be neutral, OR help you out. 
---
The world should be a dangerous place where bad things can happen,  but that doesn't mean you want them to happen or need to enjoy doing them to want to play in such a world.
---
Roll need on everything...saves you so much time getting mount money :P
---
The roaming packs of murdering pvpers are gonna be interesting. I mean it already happens but only to increase sodium levels.
---
Lbrs is probably 1.5h, if you do some jump skips or have a good group
---
Every post is pointless dude who cares
---
&gt; Seems like a way to have cheap servers and save up on costs. Money grab with nostalgia and have artificial lag in the game
---
They specifically implemented spell batching because the community called for it.  So they spent time and money when they could have just done nothing.  I don't like the batching either... but calling that a cash grab is just as stupid.
---
Just got my warrior to 60 a couple weeks ago, up until around mid 30s I think 2h fury or 2h arms are fine (really splitting hairs with the differences). Once you get WW and SS I think Arms starts to edge out 2h fury especially for dungeons, and once you hit 40 Arms all the way baby.
---
I have patience for one wipe, if the group continues to not let me tank properly, I just say thank you for the group, I have to leave. And I’ll just go do another instance because tanks are needed. Not dealing with time wasting
---
It was originally planned for phase 2, they just decided to give it to us early.
---
So at the time that the announcement for keyrings was made, the first patch was phase two.
---
Sounds like a bunch of 10 year olds.
---
Sometimes on my rogue I'll Target the "wrong one" on purpose because the tank has no idea what priority should be and they just randomly mark whatever. I'll jump on a healer/caster mob and interrupt/stun them keeping them locked down.
---
It goes well with the clip tho lol
---
Except we do?
---
This is my server: https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?faction=Horde&amp;lastSeen=7&amp;realm=4727_Windseeker
---
Pretty much. Murder isn't even evil in this game. I get murdered by groups daily. I'm immune to being tilted to coming back from afk in a zone and seeing I'm dead. I expect it. This kind of gaslighting though, if done over long periods of time could drive someone crazy. Imagine secretly following someone every time they log in and when they afk you do something, nothing too obvious, just something that they can't be sure was how they left. That's fucked.
---
Would a druid tank be high in demand during levelling too? I guess that he would since hes still a tank
---
How are ya!
---
I don't think win-trading or kill-trading will really exist on real servers. You could do a lot of things like that on Pservers since the populations were so much smaller, the communities were tighter and you could set that kind of thing up; i.e. Devilsaur Mafias. Gonna be way too many folks on real servers who just wanna watch the world burn lol.
---
ZF you can do about 44/45 with a good group.  Should also look at some RFD runs and Uldaman Runs.
---
WoW is apparently accurate, notice how people turn in his general direction as he passes by but don't attack him.
---
People get the key to Searing Gorge?
---
I've played on retail Vanilla, two private servers, and Classic and I have never gotten that key.

Hello, I am following this guide with my warrior alt, I know it is not entended for warriors maybe, but it's doable. And I am having so much fun, that this warrior is going to become my main. Doing evey quest is slow but I am so glad to follow it, I am planning to do every single quest even if, by any bad luck, they become gray. That's the way I enjoy it.
---
I used a cat until 35-40. Hated my wolf for a few levels until it was max loyalty then never looked back.
---
He's not talking about nightfall the 2h axe, he's talking about the warlock talent with the same name that gives instant cast shadowbolts.
---
Oh yeah, I hate that where you have to spam gheals, you get so much threat and if the tank isn't even able to tank it's just so annoying.
---
Yeah I've soured a bit on killing tinkerer though, he's killed me twice when my pet got feared.  Then there's the long run back and I can't even port back into the right area of Maraudon....then I get lost trying to run back out after I zone into purple.... man what a waste of time that all is.
---
When did they ever promise us progressive itemization? That's pretty much the opposite of what I've seen on every outlet where they've said final versions only :o
---
How DARE you!
---
The shoulders that drop of Balnazzar
---
I think priest at 19 wasn't nearly as good. There was one quest for a weapon you could get at 29 to be able to apply +30 spell power which did so much for you. I could 3 shot a rogue and my renews would top me off in 3 ticks. lol
---
More then just one shots going on all g tho
---
Run with a warrior tank and tell the group you'll roll on leather tanking pieces...you won't be competing for the same pieces most of the time (exceptions: rings, necks).
---
The benefit from weaponskill caps at 308, and going from 305 to 308 is roughly a 3% dps increase on white hits, which is fairly decent.
---
Did you play it with sounds?
---
What exactly are you doing to have your pet run away like that? Looks very useful for kiting.
---
Oh I thought it was damage and healing. Thank you. That means flask of supreme power is only spell damage as well?
---
Grenade 3 peeps, cooldowns, zoom in on a chain lightning for 10 minutes.
---
They literally said they would release items as they come out mate... The 60 set was not out before naxx.
---
cringe post dude
---
Pvp in tbc isnt any worse or "damaged" as you called it compared to vanilla, it was just different. A common complaint back in the day was how quickly you can get blown up, nobody likes not being able to respond, thats why fear is so frustrating to people.  
---
So the fix is obviously make people not get 1 shotted and be able to respond. Its not any better or worse.
---
Time to train first aid and run around in defensive stance?
---
It depends a lot on your server. 20-30g on average from the vendor drops and potions you can sell on AH.
---
If you can sell class trinket books, then you get a potential upside of books now and then for extra gold.
---
If you can sell tribute loot, then you can get a nice bump there. Most people that made a killing did so by selling a lot of tribute loot within the first week.
---
From there, it depends how fast you can clear it. It takes a significant amount of practice to get fast -- on your first kills I'd expect 20-30 minute to clear + reset. As you get more practice you can get that down to \~15 minutes (or faster).
---
There is definitely a learning curve and I wouldn't call it a relaxing farm -- killing king is easy but getting there requires some focus.
---
It's not too late, but you won't  be able to tank level appropriate dungeons in  int/spirit gear.
---
Cadaverous Armor is too good to pass up. Keep going for it.
---
what addon is this with the health bars? (sorry i'm new here lol)
---
Back in the day tons of low/no skill players chose hunter because they heard they were easy to level and you could solo elites.
---
Now tons of low/no skill players choose dps warrior or mage because they hear the dps is high and 40 man raids want them.  
---
They neglect to remember that 5 man groups benefit from mages, but often don't benefit from dps warriors.
---
Ah, a man of culture.
---
If it helps, you really only need to aim for lvl 58 ish, then you could try to dungeon spam your way to 60 if phase 2 hits.
---
Thanks for the correction!
---
Started trib runs on Friday night after getting engi to 200. One slight fuckup and you have to start all over! I tried more times than I like to admit and decided FUCK IT! I don't have the patience for it.
---
With the onset of honour, I suppose I should try to learn how to pvp. How might a lvl 37 aff-warlock defend themselves? 
---
My intuition is that fear dotting is the preferred method, but that only seems to work if I instigate the fight. Against melee I should sacrifice the void Walker, curse of exhaustion and dot kite. Against casters I should curse of tongues and fear dot. 
---
Is there more nuance I'm missing? I'd appreciate the help!
---
In that case you don't have a very rich imagination
---
Yes. Healers will use Distilled Wisdom flasks if anything. Although you could make the argument for Titans on some very specific fights.
---
It's also fantastic in pvp. It always worked wonders if you have a weapon swap macro for when you're fighting a rogue/warrior
---

If they reset the server I'm out. What's the point of playing an RPG if your character gets deleted?

When you have 1 set (lvl 58) and then in patch 1.11 update the blue set to lvl 60 and remake the stats / setbonuses whatever.  
---
How the hell are you so adamant that theres Several Versions of the lvl "58" set that came in patch 1.4 and that the 1.11 set is somehow added ontop of the already existing 58?  
---
 [https://itemization.info/item/17617](https://itemization.info/item/17617) (1.4 Priest gloves)  
---
 [https://itemization.info/item/22869](https://itemization.info/item/22869) (1.11 Priest gloves)  
---
There is no seperate updated lvl 58 set, The updated 58 set IS the 60 set. They never changed the original lvl 58 set items, they still exist if you had them after the expansion i guess.   
---
The new 60 items are newly created items, theyre not the old ones with changed stats so maybe thats what u got wrong?  
---
Theres been several blue posts, interviews, youtube coverage videos saying that the PVP items will follow 1.12 itemization patch alongside every other item in the game. In 1.12 the lvl 58 is NOT available and has been replaced with the new 60 set.   
---
There exists no "updated" lvl 58 blue set. That is the 60 one.  
---
IF you want proof, just click the link above with the 1.4 patch gloves, if they were ever changed in 1.11 it would say so.  
---
 Like this for example.  [https://itemization.info/item/17076](https://itemization.info/item/17076)
---
What you shouldn't expect is that 1v1 will be in anyway fair, cause if I want to get honor as fast as possible i'll be killing people after they are low on health from fighting anything but me.
---
There's nothing wrong with correcting someone who is going the wrong way.
---
Try saying something in party chat instead of pulling though.
---
Been leaked numerous times , some googling will pull it up. Check the wow sub as well
---
&gt;These days I log onto an Alt immediately if I'm being camped/ganked in the open world. 
---
lol yikes
---
Yes, classes matter even more in Classic. In BfA it’s more about the role (tank/healer/DPS), and lots of classes can do them well. But in Classic, a lot of classes are very sub-optimal at other roles. For example, most Paladins are only in raids to heal, not do DPS. Guilds do allow some to DPS, mind you, but it’s not optimal.
---
Even DPS classes tend to have cookie-cutter talents to be most optimal. 
---
Shadow Priest is viable at 60, but most raids don't want more than 1 or 2. They'd prefer you be a healer, since Holy Priests are the best raid healers.
---
Don't level a second druid...just heal a warrior tank and tell them you'll be rolling need on leather tanking pieces.
---
By the way....it's WAY easier to heal dungeons and get leather tanking gear than it is to tank dungeons and roll against the healer on healing gear.
---
Once you get to 60, you'll find you have no shortage of dungeon opportunities if you run HotW and have decent gear for both specs.
---
If you'll take advice from a HotW druid chasing BIS for both specs though...pick one to focus on in endgame.  You'll pick up other pieces as you focus on them, but pick one to focus on.  Focusing on both simultaneously has been the bane of my existence.
---
I have a Mage alt and come from a healer main, so I'm pretty on point on Mana and what to expect in regards to healing or what speed to try to go at.
---
Last time, we had this tank who was adamant about us waiting for 3 sunders on skull before attacking. And by adamant, I mean aggressive about it. Now, don't get me wrong, I love to give time to said tank to build some threat before starting my rotation, or I'll simply cast level 1 frostbolts to slow adds down (if they aren't being LOS'd).
---
The problem is, it was a Deadmines run.
---
So first of all the tank would have never been able to hold aggro off of 3+ packs of miners and defias, but he would also wait for everyone to be absolutely topped to band his bow and attack a single target. So we started adding a couple more adds here and there, frost nova'ing them then aoe-ing the pack of smallies before they'd even get out of being rooted.
---
Mister Dwarf there decided to leave while cursing all of us because we wouldn't wait for 3 sunders and one of said adds focused on the healer for a couple of seconds before dying.
---
Fun day, we kept on going without him as the second warrior went in a "tank" role and we found a replacement.
---
\_\_
---
My point is that sometimes tanks just have control issues and honestly, there are times when you need to know how to let loose a little. Especially during super easy content you can steam roll through...
---
Well, I play daily, I am in 4 different guilds on different servers with chars running between 30-55 in each.  Logging into each of these guilds and looking at roster of each, only about 35% of all players are 60.    
---
A simple /who in a city will show you the population appears to be about 50% level 60s.  Since we know 60s are more likely to be in a hub doing LFG, AH, ETC this seems accurate towards my guild samples as well.
---
So yes, the OP is still ahead of what may possibly still be the majority of players at 50% or so.   Just because you might have rushed 60 as tryharding it does not mean everyone else did.
---
Toss dots up and fear. Warlocks are my least favorite class to gank, because if they get 1 fear off, I'm dead.
---
Wrong. Def cap is not needed as long as you have one point in imp shield block.
---
Get stamina, armor and avoidance (def and dodge) to survive. And mix in hit items like you are doing and go down mc.
---
WoW classic is a re-release of a 15 year old game. I wouldn't say it's a stretch that the average player has a life and responsibilities. Is this a game for teenagers or a game for adults revisiting their nostalgia? Honestly ask yourself.
---
From my understanding a lot of that is that warlocks lack a threat dump.
---
P2 is now slated for release and I find myself thinking about this thread more and more.
---
Yes definitely.  I've been in groups all the way up to scholo with druid tanks.  Nobody really cares as long as there's a tank - that's the hardest role to fill.
---
Are you on a pvp server? I am on a pve server and the # of assholes I've encountered is few so far.
---
Hi, /u/jheewee

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/drk3ns/need_help/). 
---
375-625 health per charge.
---
So 15,000-25,000 health when you account for 40 of them. But with a 5 min cool down that would break it down to technically 83.33 HPS if you staggered them. You’d have to have a ton of precise uses and a rotation schedule. You could probably create an add on to help with tracking who should heal when and possibly increase your effectiveness with close range first aid. Would be a long ass fight though.
---
sometimes i just chain sheep it even if it has a dot on it, just to make a point (shout out to tanks with deepwounds)
---
Hmm I didn't even realize he had a fear,  I'm a lock and don't use a pet on him. His AI is weird, with some practice you could probably just strafe kite him around. Hell stop constantly to use his flamethrower and you could get two free aimed shots in each time. May be worth experimenting and practicing.
---
The biggest technical challenge Blizzard is facing is a fucking keyring?
---
You can try advertising in trade chat that you can make the shield and try and craft it for a fee. But I would make one and try to sell it.
---
Yeah DM West is the hardest for healers FOR SURE imo. It should honestly be hardest for DPS too because now if they pull aggro they're way more likely to die. I'm a priest and prefer not to have everyone at 30-50% health constantly during those pulls.
---
I have guildies that won't duel me anymore because of reck bombs
---
Might I add that temporary weapon effects do not stack with eachother. So don't poison / sharpening stone your mainhand if you want to benefit from windfury totem.
---
Start complaining more please, the faster everyone does, the faster blizzard is gonna pretend to come up with the last minute brilliant solution of paid server transfers.
---
Could u explain?
---
Will they also work cross-faction?
---
Tyvm, looks like I'll go druid tank then!
---
I assumed that one was better anyway. Thank you
---
oh shit that's cool  
---
doesn't give your argument weight but neat site
---
Grobbulus is an RPPVP server.
---
This is a pvp event being spread using RP.
---
Short answer: yes
---
It's a big problem with zoomers only caring about slot lists rather than understanding the calculations or weights between crit and ap. What you need to do is make a custom stat weighting in wowhead's item finder. 
---
For example, about a month ago I came up with these weights for an arms warrior based off of old school equivalent ap ratings and an understanding that stam is as important as killing stufd.
---
Stam: 4
---
Str: 4
---
AP: 2
---
Agi: 3
---
Crit: 60
---
With the understanding that you still want 5% hit for PvP. I debated trying to add armor because it's pretty important for certain matchups, but I couldn't find a comparison measure that I was really happy with. Instead I'm just trying to lean towards plate as much as possible if the stats are kinda close.
---
No one wants Druid tank gear other than other druids and the occasional rogue.  Shouldn’t be much completion for the gear.  Most people won’t care that you’re rolling for an off spec especially since you’re not taking gear from them.
---
 Flask of distilled wisdom is amazing, but I would 100% not recommend it for MC. Just bring plenty of dark/demonics if your guild’s down times are on the longer sides. I was using 5-10 a raid the first few weeks but last week I think I used one on rag and maybe one of Major Domo if that
---
This is too fast honestly. The game should be catered for the original players who now have responsibility. Otherwise bye bye subscribers.
---
I'd expect February at the earliest, with March being most likely landing date. That gives the top guilds basically 6-7 months in MC, and for most semi-hardcore guilds it'll be 5-6 months in MC. We'll be tired of it by that point, so you really want to release it by then or risk people losing interest.
---
It also puts it on a good time table for the expansion release next year. My personal belief is they'll drop Phase 5 before Shadowlands, and then release Phase 6 after some of the Shadowlands hype has fallen off to keep people playing both games as long as possible.
---
Whenever people come up with hunter tips, the most overlooked tends to be:" next time, try an useful class"
---
I agree - there should be an option to allow the opposing faction to port into an dungeon/raid occupied by the opposite side to allow them to stir mayhem inside the instance.
---
Oh yeah you're gucci then if theyre geared
---
I'm also level 55. Phase 2 brings pvp honor but no new raid. You have plenty of time get be attuned for MC and Ony. Even when the next raid comes out guilds will still do those raids or there will be pugs for them I'm sure. I see pugs all the time right now
---
Ironically that team would lose to something like hunter, lock, x, maybe warrior i guess?
---
How ironic
---
Why are you the way you are dude
---
Could have waited longer than 2 months. It is rushed.
---
It doesnt seem that easy as a warlock but idk maybe im just bad lol
---
What build do you run?
---
Yes, tell him, not me. Trying to find his reasoning. The other guy did mention the arrows selling, they gonna sell by you cancelling them? Moving on then
---
Thank you for making this thread. I've been feeling the same way. I'm at 45 right now and guild has been clearing MC. It's very reassuring to know others feel the same way and that so many people are supportive so people don't quit.
---
That last bit of knowledge was very valuable. Thanks again, I was also unsure whether spell cancelling would interrupt my mana regeneration. And I never knew 0 mana spells don't affect my regeneration, I have this spell that gives me one free speel (without mana cost) and it always seemed like my regeneration just went on but I wasn't sure if it actually did. Now I am sure :)
---
Reck, baby. 
---
Reckoning/Ret isn't too bad a spec because you can still get 1 point of vengeance (+3%) so at least you get the glowy hand effect and people assume you're ret so they might discount the threat of reck bombs. 
---
IMO Holy/reck is the best paladin PVP spec.  25/26/0 with divine favor, the lower tier holy support talents, uninterruptible heals (4/5 spiritual focus, 2/3 improved conc aura) and blessing of sanc so you can dungeon tank in your off-time with the right gear.
---
Generally it is 1 bar of the key type (gold key, silver key etc) and a corresponding level stone.
---
So they are pretty cheap.
---
To the point, I wasn't really sure if you could push glances off the table at 60.
---
Which mobs?
---
Ironic. He could see cancer in others...but not himself.
---
i got a warden staff drop early in leveling while i was arms and able to farm mobs and kill stuff effectively.
---
I actually found my name on the list. The website is made by two undead rogues who sit at the entrance of BRM and Dire Maul invisible and gank anyone who comes in 2v1. Pretty bad players to be honest.
---
I'm pretty sure they've maintained the original pace of the patches etc, plus minus a bit. It's just that everyone has rushed to 60, taken time off etc. so it seems like you are falling behind while you are actually leveling about the same speed as the average person did back then.
---
Phase 1 only lasted two months, there’s no way in hell the phase with the least amount of content added will last 4+ months.
---
My favorite tanking moment is this area was when I was marking the next pull, someone said "We can skip those", and I responded "Probably" as I pulled them.
---
gimme that sweet sweet discord name please.
---
They’re great at ~53-54 but grinding them at 59 you’re taking such a big exp penalty.
---
Why is spirit worse on us than priests?
---
P2 just adds honor system.  Why is this waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay to soon?  It could have been released as a part of P1.
---
You can play the game after all phases are done.
---
I don't care about anything in any update aside from battlegrounds.
---
I like levelling, hate world pvp and love battleground pvp. Dungeons and raids are ok I suppose.
---
This is Grobbulus lol
---
Don't know why I thought it was only crushing blows. So yes it's less important than I was expecting.
---
Gotcha thanks for the input. I'll plan on re speccing probably around 55 then once I'm running dungeons mostly to get pre bis gear.
---
I still plan on solo leveling most of the way from 45-60 since that's been the fastest for me.
---
I do still plan on healing when needed so I'll most likely end up taking NS over LotP.
---
I just wasn't sure if LotP was a needed talent for OT raiding. I'm sure my guild will also let me know if they need it or not.
---
According to wowhead you have to kill gorosh about 12 ish times for one drop.
---
I mean the "Full" status was replaced by "Layered" on the server list...
---
Make your bandages on the zep or waiting for groups to form, not while grinding. Turn your silk into heavy bandages and vendor them for the same amount you would in the ah.
---
&gt; Engineering makes you feel like the only guy in the party with weed.
---
I saw that youtube video too!
---
Makes a huge difference in your net DPS when you're trying to attack mobs with higher miss chance (orange+). You miss more and when you do hit there's less chance to crit/more chance to do reduced damage.
---
Thanks for the tip.
---
Sounds like you didn't think about it before you committed. It took you two months to realize that tank spots are limited? Damn.
---
With the item/talent rework already in place I think a lot of people will clear bwl quite easily.
---
Need lv 50 for Darn portal.
---
My favorite vanilla video is the death and taxes Cthun attempt where they have like 14-16 healers and they kept talking about how the dps checks were impossible to reach rofl
---
I don't know why it's frowned upon to want to know if their healer in a high end dungeon is actually a healing spec. Bro you can 100% heal as shadow pre-55. But the amount of wipes that could be prevented in Scholo/DM/Strat by knowing your priest is actually secretly shadow is big.
---
It's a good thing you can raid log in Classic, that way you avoid all the gank squads by playing other games that are not as content starved as Classic is.
---
You should get out of the mentality of comparing yourself to others and fearing missing out. This is only worse in real life.
---
As a tank I see this alot, people ninja pulling, while for the tank to pull is very important for good threat generation. I completely agree on the bit where people just need to focus on what they are doing, you don't see many tanks in classic because they're not easy to play and you have a fair bit of responsibility. Respect the tanks and how they play.
---
I had to stop watching
---
He shoulda just sat down as if he was late to class or something.. I'm literally sitting here sweating a little because of how cringy that was....
---
Number one time saving trick. Think about what you want to do before you log on. You don't need to plan out exactly everything, but you should have at least some idea.
---
edgeyy
---
It's pretty low number also I checked my server, it shows like 90% horde with 10% to alliance. My server actually something like 60/40 of not closer
---
Looks so close to our kill pic last night that I had to check if I was in it
---
If you're just looking for an herb farming toon,  you might check out druids. Cat form is functionally like a rogue,  and has the same benefits of being able to stealth through mobs to get to nodes, with the added benefit of big speed buffs without having to mount up.  Plus if you're horde, tauren get a boost to herbalism
---
Thank god I skipped all this prebis shit and went straight for MC and got most my loot there
---
That made me laugh. Lol
---
exactly, all that energy and what looks like doubt should have been used as "Can you believe this priest trying to pull a fast one on me?"
---
just doing my duty
---
Grobbulus, America.
---
I don’t get how people run out of arrows that fast. Are you guys using fast aspd weapons? I only ever had an arrow problem in BFD when my bow was like 1.5s lol
---
try googling for your class discord
---
isnt racial abilities what makes you the master race?
---
damn dude that sucks, I have done 3 runs and they have dropped in two of the three runs.
---
Yeah he’s been working on that recently. Faster to run as a group though, and more fun to play with guildies.
---
In my opinion at least
---
Thanks for the reply. I wasnt aware that the elixer didn't stack
---
Why next phases are unable to clear ? You mean difficulty or time investment ?
---
Reddit reposting is the sincerest form of flattery.
---
https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?faction=Horde&amp;realm=4410_Skeram  
---
you play on a really small server
---
I've been leveling up the wind serpent pet the last few days to do that a bit easier.  Honestly the money from killing DM ogres outside the instance had been decent too.
---
I just roll on all the plate gear I want, and don't invite dps warriors. Waste of a dungeon dps spot IMO.
---
Depends on why you are trying to log onto said “friend’s” account
---
Yeah, this guy is a joke. Tank entitlement is in full swing, and he's mad they didn't reserve a spot for him a month ago. No great loss.
---
These are the same people that take an hour and a half to get to the dungeon...
---
Point remains valid
---
Damn, I appreciate you replying. Considering you have a job and university I'm surprised you had the time.
---
They really aren’t. This is only slightly ahead of the phase release schedule that took place in vanilla, and the amount of content being added in phase 2 is extremely minor. With that being said, for people who care about pvp this is an important patch and will add a lot of opportunity to start that grind.
---
I understand it feels too fast for some people, but there will always be people not ready for a phase. Unfortunately I think your expectations are just off, because some people thought that classic would move slower than vanilla when Blizzard already said it will either be the same pace, and slightly faster in some parts.
---
I think all rogues should be considered, because while their spec may be built for a certain weapon, their role is always melee dps, and this is the most important slot by a wide margin. If the sword guy and the dagger guy are equal on whatever criteria are used to determine loot, give it to the dagger guy, but this is very rarely the case. My guild does give weapon prio, so while i think its dumb its not a huge deal for me, however.
---
You are ready to tank, obviously not MT, but either the OT or the 3rd tank in MC. I would also say that you aren't ready for solo tanking Ony. But once you start getting gear from MC, you'll be ready in a few weeks if dice or if LC/DKP are in your favor.
---
Make bank alts!
---
I always keep an alt for cloth, an alt for leather+herbs, and an alt for DE greens (plus another for actually auctioning). Every time I hit the quest hub I just mail the appropriate materials to the appropriate alts. Keeps my bags clean and leveling 1-60 gives enough random mats to cover half the cost/farm of leveling any profession.
---
By the time I got my main to 40 I had 150 Leatherworking, Blacksmithing, Enchanting and Alchemy on alts just from the mats I got leveling (herb/skinning while I level main) and enough to get LW and Alchemy in particular to 225+
---
This also allows me to keep each of those alts parked at various vendors with valuable recipes/schematics, as well as compartmentalizing the different item markets to sell mats at highs to pay for my mount the moment I hit 40 (with lots to spare!)
---
Zoomers aren't playing wow, especially not classic wow.
---
Fair point mostly.  Honestly though, I don't think it's about the \_rest\_ of the gear - I think it's about the need to talent into a spec.  Granted , it is a gray area/slippery slope, but if the reasoning for allowing them to roll (from the original question) is 'since they could respec if they are currently using swords' I think that is valid for any class that could respec to make use of a particular item.  If the original reasoning was 'since they can respec to use daggers without impacting their role (i.e., still be dps)', then I think you can take the role-switching hybrids out of the equation, but you'd still be left with druid feral vs. boomkin, shaman elem vs. enhance, locks  +fire damage vs. +shadow, mages fire/arcane/frost, etc.  I think the more you can make raid rules apply broadly, the clearer everything is.  I would generally advocate for: if your current talents support use of the dropped item, you get priority.  If you need to respec to support the drop, you get secondary priority.  As an aff lock, I wouldn't roll on a +fire damage item just b/c I could respec to destro unless all the existing fire mages and destro locks passed.
---
Respec and join the alpha Chad druids
---
Hunter top dps till bwl my dude
---
Yea, that make sense. Our rez has a 30 min cooldown to which stinks.
---
A properly geared/spec'd feral can easily top DPS charts. I regularly top DPS charts by powershifting and using energy efficiently. Using Devilsaur set with Wolfshead helm, Blackstone ring, and a couple of good green/blue agility pieces has been working great for me so far.
---
Leveling as feral has been great and has allowed me to gather a great healing set of gear for off spec/respec. I always ask the healer if they need the +healing gear that drops, and if they don't I need on it. Will make respec'ing much easier.
---
Well if you're on a pvp server epic mount for sure. Could you imagine phase 2 coming out and never being able to outrun someone who's better geared than you?
---
Total Biscuit would be proud. Well done guys :)
---
Evil bat eyes sell for 20s ea and drop 27-28% of the time. With skinning and other drops they're pretty profitable
---
bro im on my 7th-8th rag kill tomorrow night and still havent seen one!! I have corehound but I can't wait to get perds..
---
You're at 55, you've already made it to endgame. You can already start gearing up for raids at your own pace and you'll hit 60 doing it, even if it takes a month. And you'll be making meaningful progress.
---
Take a look at your prebis gear list and just run dungeons whenever you hop on. You can run BRD and LBRS easily, most classes have plenty of gear. Outside of that, look up attunements and focus on getting those done. These are all things that can be done in an hour or two, any day of the week.
---
Think about it this way, you don't have any dailys to log in and do. You dont have to get on and keep your heart of azeroth up to date. You could log off for a month, get back on, and you wont be any further behind.
---
Those trinkets aren’t released because of the patch they were introduced, not they strength. Don’t be dumb.
---
Would be interested in something like this if it in NA as well. Pally too.
---
I like it more that they were already fighting your other party members and you found a way to get in. That’s awesome.
---
Yes. Sexy the orc hunter was out there every day for like 10 hours a day or more. It was wild. "But they don't get anything out of it!" is a stupid thing to say. They DO get something out of it: they piss people off, which delights them to no end. They don't care about 'honor' they want to have their brand of fun...namely irritating the other faction endlessly.
---
Use that rested and do the dungeon quests at high lvl. 
---
They provide excellent exp and rewards!
---
Also get attuned/keys to different dungeons. Again, excellent exp and able to get into the dungeons. 
---
Dont feel like you have to hurry up and gogogo!
---
Find a guild, if you dont have one.  You will find LOTS of folks are in your shoes. 
---
If you only have a limited time, use the reddit foe your realm or discord or what ever your guild has and set up scheduled runs to min down time in getting into stuff. 
---
It will comedown to smart use of time that will get you over the hump!
---
I am undergeared and will only be 58 for this mc run so I am not expecting much. Just want to make sure I'm helping as much as possible so I'm not a burden. I know at 60 I wont need everything.
---
I have heard that people are using flash heal to snipe heals so their meters look really good. With only 250ish +healing I was planning to use max rank greater heal most of the time but I'm not sure if that's more efficient than Heal rank 2 or greater heal rank 1
---
yeah man, I think that too, thx a lot
---
At least you have a strategy! OP is just bitching. I hope you find what you're looking for, though.
---
Mailing to them takes 1 hour, the return is instant.
---
Rested XP + BRD.
---
Most of the druid tank gear is rogue dps gear, not warrior tank gear. (yes there are a few items we share) but for the most part not.)  Just tell the group your building your tanking set, and the groups actual tank obvisouly has "dibs" on any gear both of you would want.
---
Since we use leather, and armor, agility and stam are our most important stats. (str and hit are both very nice, but to starting tanking, extra threat  isn't as important as damage soaking and mitigation since bears get more threat, and have talents to help with that.)
---
Trust me your competition for  early 50's are a bunch of dps warriors, who might be willing to throw on a shield, and have less hit points than your caster form. It doesn't take much to have the healers relived to see they have a bear tank instead of a warrior for 5 mans.
---
Can we do the gnome sound bytes now??
---
For real. A random blue BoE necklace dropped in Strat live the other day and only after I rolled greed did the rest of the party (guildmates) decide to all roll need since they decided it was a high dollar item. I know that with some items everyone probably should roll need, but if I lose out on one more item because of something like this I'm going to resort to rolling need on all BoE's and that genuinely makes it worse for everyone.
---
It's only been out for 2 months, still way too early to tell if it's successful
---
As a holy/prot Paladin, it’s basically my only way to hope I can take people by surprise to secure a kill.
---
Onyxia and MC will be raided until whatever plan for the future of Classic comes about. There is no 'end of phase 1 raiding.' Just keep doing what you're doing.
---
You get one /roll.  That's it.  There is no 'it doesn't count'.  If you /roll, that's your number regardless of anything. 
---
I was in a pretty hardcore guild in another MMO before this one and saw people raid kicked and gkicked for doing just that.  It's a super big no-no because of the dishonesty of it all.
---
Next class is in an hour ;)
---
I’ve leveled both and hunter is way more fun. Priest leveling is wand simulator. Imo hunter is the most fun leveling experience as you have pet mini-game, less travel time, can solo stuff other classes can’t. It’s the best.
---
Tch
---
He's upset that he got shat on lmao.
---
Let's do a little thought experiment, I THINK you're a little bitch.
---
They already making it a bit more like classic. Sharding and cross realm group finder wont go anywhere tho
---
Skip the escort quest from Darkshore to Ashenvale unless you're in a group of at least 3 ([https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=5321/the-sleeper-has-awakened](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=5321/the-sleeper-has-awakened)).
---
Also, don't try to find the pieces for the druid Aquatic Form on your own. Just look up the locations on wowhead ([https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=272/trial-of-the-sea-lion](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=272/trial-of-the-sea-lion)) :\]
---
Just because they are 40 and in discord doesn't mean they are good, experienced players.. everyone can do that.
---
The flight masters in Moonglade (the free ones) give you pretty good descriptions of where to get the two halves of the Aquatic Pendant. 😉
---
Seems like they are
---
Use deathbringer + BB for trash or bosses with several mobs.
---
Switch to BB + mirah for bosses or lvl 63 mobs.
---
Windseeker here also. A lot of great people on both sides
---
Typical huntard, simply doesn't understand that someone needs to pick up the mob after FD to keep it off the healer.
---
Drop siphon life from your rotation except for bosses, and use CoA more sparingly (prob not worth it on skull unless skull will take a while to kill - may be better on a tertiary target b/c it will get a chance to tick longer).   Shadowbolt spam the primary target once you've dotted everything, and only refresh corruption (and then only if it'll get a few ticks off).  Use shadowburn as a coup-de-grace if desired.  \*\*remember to make your pet attack - that may be 10% of your damage or so depending on what you're running\*\*
---
watch the life of what you're attacking.  if the target is down to 5-10% life, that shadowbolt you're casting is at best not going to go off at all and and worst is going to cast but not reach its target before it dies.  Be ready to interrupt your own cast to prevent downtime if it looks like your bolt is not going to reach.
---
beyond that, remember that some greens of shadow wrath are better for dps than blues.  I'm running +88 shadow damage at the moment which is not a lot but definitely makes a difference.
---
source: am 56 warlock and was complimented last night by a 60 mage in lbrs for dealing good damage for my level.
---
You should just automatically do this anyway, if you aren't DS.  Any other pet is going to die pretty fast, and not provide a lot of dmg value.
---
Actually thinking about it, it might be worthwhile to potentially save sitting for 1k mana.  Shammy has self res so the potential 'reverse res' matters less.
---
It’s like 1:100,000,000 for a 3rd roll to have to happen
---
Took me about 20 runs for mine, luckily everyone else already had it /cheer.
---
Now about the Dal'Rend MH....
---
I went from 58-60 doing the dungeons I would have done anyway going for gear. No one had a problem taking me and the XP was actually good. No reason to think doing UD strat, DM, lbrs etc are not feasible. This is great advice
---
The inevitable fights over Blizzard releasing content too quickly to satisfy the jobless players
---
I am a fury warrior and I hate when people try guilting me into tanking.  Sometimes I will tank but I will join saying I can tank.  If I join saying I want to DPS it's because that's what I feel like doing.  I started out running my 60 dungeons and MC as Prot but we got enough tanks where we wanted more DPS in guild so I  switched over to full on DPS.  Tanking with DPS build means sunder costs 15 rage and that makes it a PITA to keep threat unless dps actually waits for you to build some (hint: they don't in pugs).  Also I don't always carry my tank gear with me so if you want me to suddenly tank I am doing it partly wearing leather.
---
They shouldn't have to pay 60g for something they need that dropped for them you fucking ninja.
---
But plenty of things which were released later in the game are in the game now while the class quests aren't.  There is a lot of scattershot shit going on in how they release stuff.
---
So what happened?! You can't leave us hanging like that. Did you have to run there?
---
It should not be used as an opening move for single target dps in a situation where there are multiple mobs. That's incredibly stupid.
---
do dungeons if it's really that big of a problem.
---
Someone is mad
---
 \&gt; With proper play the healer does not go oom that fast, thus you can do more pulls before you have to rest etc. 
---
With proper play the healer should only need to mana up just before a boss or an extreme pull, if their regen is tuned right they should be able to keep up.
---
You're projecting your misunderstanding of the word onto the majority.
---
6% with edgemasters. Good luck on second binding!
---
Stop being a cringer.
---
It's coming in p2. You're taking everything too literally.
---
Oh yeah, definitely some good money to be made there
---
As a druid I thought so many mobs were immune to cc. As a rogue, I have learned that nah, they just wanted to focus on DPS instead of crowd control.
---
Yeah, because most people on the alliance don't care about having the rarest, horde only, saves 900g, mount in the game. He can reserve an orb or keep spamming for hours.
---
I don't fall into that trap. If I am stealthed, no way am I popping that when I can still set up the fight on my terms, and use my sprint to break out of that frost nova. Dumbass played himself.
---
Did I end up in FFXI again?
---
Background:
---
Just dinged 43 last night on my Dwarf Spriest. The mount grind had me pretty burnt out but after getting it and finally upgrading my relevant spells I’m starting to feel like im making some progression again. Since I started about 3 weeks ago and understand that I am about half way in terms of total experience, I expect to hit 60 around Thanksgiving. I rolled on Bigglesworth, NA because I played PvE in Vanilla and wanted a different experience... so far the only thing I’ve experienced is ?? players ruining my day while I’m questing. From what I can tell this server is pretty Horde favored and I’m expecting the ganking to get worse since I’ll probably be about 48 when P2 launches. My only real cc is using fear, but it seems everybody that I fight breaks the fear immediately (I swear 90% of the ganks are undead rogues). 
---
Tailoring (201) and Enchanting (165) are my professions, but enchanting has fallen behind since I was Vendoring everything for gold for the last ~10 levels. I’ve been making most of my money farming rock elementals and flipping essences on the AH for about 1g apiece.
---
Questions:
---
1. Should I just take the L and farm dungeons once honor launches? if so, what can I get out of the way now in the over world that I won’t be able to later?
---
2. Should I drop enchanting since it has fallen so far behind? I have a decent amount of materials that I have never been able to use (shards, greater essences), but I only need dust to rank up and can never get enough. If so, what gathering profession would be the most profitable? 
---
3. Should I expect to be forced to respec around 55 for dungeons and only heal? I already know I will respec at 60 as an spriest for the more pvp focused talents since now I’m specd for leveling.
---
4. Any tips for PvP, maybe another form of CC that I can purchase as a trinket? I feel like I can win a fair 1v1 at my level, but people only engage me when I’m already fighting mobs or low on mana. Should I be doing the same?
---
You got the rare one, the offhand drops all the time, congrats!
---
if thats the case, where were they when Smaug was still alive? eagles, you  had one job!
---
You have become that lvl50something honor boar!
---
Travel in packs and call for help!  
---
Someone will come.
---
Yeah, I think you overestimate the typical raider.
---
The 50th percentile Mage for instance (this only includes raid logs, let alone people who don't parse) is only 200 dps.
---
200 dps. That's honestly level 50 mage dps in greens running 31/0/10 spec.
---
If you’re willing to put in the time to get it working. Nothing comes close to TSM in my opinion. It’s 100% worth how annoying it is to set up
---
I think it's too soon to remove layering on certain servers. I'd also prefer to give people another month or so to level up. Questing from 50-60 is already tough because there aren't enough mobs, but double the players per mob and add the honor system, and I'm not sure that leveling in the open world will be viable for a while.
---
Oh she was when my guild raided Orgrimmar a couple weeks back
---
They explicitly said "lol wait till p2 where you get to melt everyone in shitty glass cannon gear. "
---
So idk what you're on about.
---
But guess what - pvp has bis lists.
---
/cringe
---
would've been funny and possibly even worth someone's time to watch this IF and ONLY IF your inv was full when you looted
---
well...... maybe not.
---
This stuff happens all the time in classic and it warms my heart every time.
---
I just dont see the fucking difference, if i rolled greed why cant everyone roll greed too..
---
You know that and I know that, but the majority of pug huntards that I've grouped with do not know that. They also don't recognize that using FD every cooldown reduces their dps.
---
A good resto druid is rough to fight against. After watching Revery I wanted to make one.
---
Layering is already gone on pretty much every realm.  I'm on stalagg and it's been gone for like 2 weeks and I haven't seen any queues.  And this was a server who's peak queue times on released were ~20k+ with 5+ hour wait times.
---
I love having 310 swords without doing fuck all
---
this is the greatest satire of reddit tanks I've ever read
---
bravo
---
One raid you should all pull out pink Tallstriders. The REEEEE noise they make is even better
---
Undead females have great casting animations
---
Especially when their neck turns into nothing
---
The issue is being camped from Thorium Point to BRM. Dying within BRM is going to happen whether or not I think my faction will control BRM. Control will change and making sure you die as few times as possible in any scenario is important especially for rankers and people just not interested
---
People will pay for it, whether or not my faction controls BRM, and having that ability to reduce total deaths is valuable to a lot of people.
---
I do not enjoy ganking people, in fact I have stopped in the middle of attacking people who didn't fight back because there is zero enjoyment from it.
---
I leveled a warrior, essentially solo because the friends that convinced me to roll pvp all quit, on a pvp server. I clearly hate myself.
---
I made mine, it's amazing, bis for aor threat, every bit as good as the Drillbore but I don't have to wait to get it. 
---
I swap between my blue shield and it depending on the pull.
---
Def worth
---
You don't need 1h for 2/3 boss spam, that takes 12-20 mins.
---
Imagine thinking having buffs are unfair. Whoa buddy, you’re gonna hate raiding if you don’t like seeing buffs
---
If BRM isn't already Horde territory on your server, its going to be.
---
L I G H T F A L L
---
Happy Cake Day fella!
---
Just jump after the big tree
---
&gt; If you are a warrior and I don't know you, I'm not tanking for you.    
---
And I'm not gonna heal for them either. You speak the truth.
---
I have been craft green lenses for weeks looking for a green lens of shadow wrath. I have dropped a few hundred gold on craft materials (especially Jade which had risen to 1g on my server) this morning I crafted 12 more and the last 3 were all lenses of shadow wrath, that was a good feeling
---
Oof, the insecurity is strong with this one.
---
Yeah, definitely would say earlier in the week for farming...and off hours.  I tried farming last week on a raid evening and it was just farmed to extinction.
---
Do not buy warden staff. Yes, it is marginally better than UM, but it is not 400g better.
---
UM is good enough.
---
Imagine calling people a casual over a game where 90% of the difficulty comes from time sinks and game knowledge that has been determined for over 5 years.
---
Vanilla elitists are a special kind of stupid. It's like yelling uno in a game of poker. It's really not the point of the game. It's an RPG, not a competitive game. 
---
I play this old RPG because I'm tired of the competitive circlejerk that is necessary in every other modern game.
---
I did notice it’s hard to interrupt spells! I just thought I was bad at it (which is still probably true). Thanks!
---
I have healed two handed wars with no problem and have had MAJOR issues with two handed wars.  the difference is level.  An over leveled war can be two handed just fine.  If you miss, and take big damage, my first heal will be way before you’ve managed to hit most of the mobs and if fade is on cd, or I have to heal my self causing more threat, then we can be in for a tough time.  Two handed is fine when you’re able to reliably do more damage than the healer’s threat you’re increasing.
---
Be SEEING you!!
---
It's pretty easy to tell who's good at this game and I'm guessing you're not because I'm not talking about damage meters.
---
This but unironically
---
🤣
---
Yes, you probably made a mistake. I did, too. I ought to have just rolled on a regular RP server instead of hitting up PVP servers. I'm bad at PVP but it wouldn't matter anyway because there's not much I can do against people much higher leveled than me or groups from the opposing faction. I have one character at 60 (not well geared) and a bunch of alts level 40 or under. The alts are gonna be toast, which is a shame 'cause I'm an instance leveler, but good luck getting into SM without dying as Alliance! 
---
But I'll deal with it. If it's unbearable I'll just stop playing. I'm kinda meh on Classic anyway at this point.
---
This is why we are working on getting all of our guild to 60. Grobbulus is 60/40 last I saw. Hopefully things even out but hey the BG instant queues in phase 2 will be nice.
---
I mean it seems to be great fun for them, and if you take offense in getting ganked just roll pve..also you are advertising for them.
---
Slot of people are complaining about botters but I think you guys underestimate the lengths a person would go to make money in the game.
---
It’s really easy to make a macro and spam her and some people do it all day all night without botting. Sucks but they aren’t really doing anything wrong
---
I never said the 58 set was updated, the 1.12 version would be the same as the 1.4 version yes.
---
&gt;Theres been several blue posts, interviews, youtube coverage videos saying that the PVP items will follow 1.12 itemization patch alongside every other item in the game.
---
From what I can gather they have all said 1.12 version of items, not the 1.12 version.
---
Pittbull.
---
Tie rolls go to the alphabet. So Alux wins
---
As a warrior tank - this rogue has it right.  I love rogues or DPS warriors, because if they pull aggro I know they can handle it - and if they can't they will learn quick.  
---
Usually I focus my rage on either things that hit hard or that are specifically going after the healer.  Good DPS know how to mitigate incoming damage - if I see things getting out of control and have a taunt handy I'll help them back out.  I'll see tanks taunting when the mob is at 10% life and be like, "why?  you are wasting your taunts!"  
---
If a mage opens with frostbolt ASAP I know he is going to have it dead by the time it reaches him, or at least nova + blink away - if not, I'll call him out and he'll learn.
---
Can you link the weakaura please?  Ive been looking for  something to help me track this.
---
Brd arena runs should get you and also strat/scholo for das loots.
---
Why can't I wiggle?
---
Luckily I play at 3am server time during the week so I could probably get some stacks while few people are on
---
Any emote that isn't /e works cross faction.
---
I'm on Whitemane and the queues haven't been bad. Peak queue is about 1.5 hours, but most nights, there is no queue.
---
We're still on two layers, though. When we drop to one layer, I figure either the queues are going to be back, or there will be 15k-20k people logged in and things will just be very busy. It'll be interesting to see what happens to herb and ore prices.
---
This shits funny AF. Everyone talking cringe but this dude is a legend. Gives 0 fucks and isn't embarrassed he just in it to make his buddies laugh.
---
We don't know that for certain, and I'm far from being a boomer.
---
The alliance that will be hard to take on will be those in active guilds that roll out as a guild. For every person playing casually with a few friends and no guild behind them, your fucked tbh. You'll get killed, group up with some randoms to get some payback, then have a raid camp your area. You'll try and form a raid of randoms in general and LFG and likely fail and you'll just spirit res and hearth out after 40 minutes of being outnumbered 4 to 1 or worse. Then you'll run instances until you log for the night. This is already the reality for alliance on most PvP servers. Honor will make sure you don't forget you're the minority on the server.
---
In retail, running a crane was best for survival at one point (might still be), the noise it makes made my guild turn off pet sounds in game, it was one of my favorite things to do.
---
Yep. Which is why I've been keeping them in my bags. Which means 7 slots including skeleton keys.
---
I’m glad. I stuck around the 50-59 bracket with the 58 blue set and dinged 60 when they switched to the upgraded set. The 58 was pretty shiet IIRC at least for Warriors. 
---
Also, will double honor BG weekends start immediately? I’m tryna farm the hell outta AV.
---
They're still literal keys. Expiring/consumable doesn't really matter.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Keyring
---
Is dungeon 2 set in the game? No it's not.
---
So why should the set that was added in 1.11 be in the game?
---
DPS warriors wear mostly leather anyway so that's a smart move!
---
The OG chain heal
---
I always felt Bigglesworth had a pretty decent split. I know when I was leveling solo I got gained by quite a few ally death squads.
---
Yes. It forces every mob in range to attack you for 6 seconds (10 min cd) same as a druid. Warriors also have Taunt, forces mobs to attack you for 3 seconds ONLY if they weren't already attacking you (10 sec cd), and mocking blow, causes damage and forces a mob to attack you for 6 seconds (2 min cd).
---
Guildie uses vpn gets banned atleast twice a month min.

Bag slots are the most valuable commodity in the game.

You need 5% hit in pvp. The talent precision does not help for blind so gear accordingly.

---
That's the biggest circle jerk I heard of yet lol. Do you sniff eachother butts too at your achievements?
---
There never was a threat reset. Anyone who says otherwise is misinformed or not remembering correctly.
---
When she starts landing, if you do nothing she won't target you, but as soon as you touch her (or heal somebody), you will regain all of the threat you have built up for the whole fight. So just got escape when she starts landing, get in position, and wait for the tank to get her situated and tell you it's okay to open up.
---
Finish up feralas and tanaris. Then try to knock out searing gorge when it isnt peak hours if possible cause that place is pure cancer. Hit Ungoro at lvl 52. Throw some mara runs or princess runs in there if possible.
---
For spells and yellow attacks, you need only 3% hit and spell hit.

I kind of feel this is needlessly harsh, but I admit to cringing the other day when I met a paladin with Blessing of Freedom not bound.
---
This is some of the most worst advice I've ever seen given.
---
Yep, in my experience healing, the dps Warrior ALWAYS pulled threat from the tank.
---
Strat mailbox keys
---
Truesilver key for tribute run without a rogue
---
I always was against reserving orbs because I have always seen tanks say they want all the orbs. I don't think I would actually feel bad about reserving just the first orb and passing on all others. Especially since I have seen up to 4 drop in one run multiple times.
---
900g for epic mount / 35 per orb on my server = 25.7 runs. All the other gold made would probably just cut that down to about 20 runs.
---
Most of the big ones were horde-leaning to horde-dominated. I played alliance, for what it’s worth!
---
You need 5% hit for PVP, the extra hit isn’t necessarily useless as it helps your offhand poison application but certainly not as beneficial as other stats.
---
Sweet, thanks! I’d assume if mouseover macros work then clique will work too

---
I meant phase 3. Also I still bet that even with cross realm there won’t be a 50/50 split.
---
What’s in it for them?
---
Guild Name: Eat Crit and Die
---
Server:Benediction
---
Focus:PVE
---
Raid Times: Tues+Wed 9pm MC; Sun 8pm Onyxia
---
About Us: We have been doing MC for a few weeks, and starting Onyxia this Sunday. 
---
Recruitment Needs:Primarily DPS and a couple Healers
---
Expectations:Level 50+, know your class. 
---
You don't have to be attuned, or have BIS. We can help with those things.
---
Yes, only leet few nolifers who can afford to get 60 in 2 weeks are going to raid "properly". The rest of the dirty peasantry will have to do with 5 man dungeons and PUGS on holidays.
---
Coast of swamp of sorrows.  My apologies
---
Pretty sure I heard this also but I can't remember
---
youre good.
---
never thought about doing that while they are mid air lol.
---
I do this on the chain all the time.
---
There's more ways to play than being at the top and doing endgame. Not everyone cares about that. If she ever reaches endgame (probably won't) then she will run with my guild. It's not always black and white. 
---
You shouldn't label WoW as "not for you" just because they don't play for hours every day. It's really not a big deal
---
&gt; I'd be happy with just removing shards and cross-realm group finder TBH 
---
Can't. Most of the servers are nearly-deserted. - Almost everyone I've see is 'name-server'. :\\
---
No, I don't think Classic will influence Retail. My guess is this is the 'deaththrow' of WoW. Retail is failing and so they bring out 'golden era' expansions to try and keep the sub count up.
---
Some abilities can't be interrupted... but try being really fast. If it still doesn't work, then I would just work around it.
---
It's generally better to wait as long as possible into the cast so more time is wasted by the mob though.
---
The way I understand it working is: There is no aggro reset, essentially during phase 2 she will target people with fireballs depending on their threat. Each fireball hit will reduce your threat substantially, She will go down the threat list until she is pushed into phase 3. 
---
My guild has had a lot of success with having the OT be around 8-9th on the threat meter when she transitions to phase 2. By the time she lands the OT is usually within the top 3 people on threat and will pick it up very easily.
---
technically it was the eviscerate but ill give it to ya.
---
I am literally laughing at work reading about this little hypocrite fuck. What a little BITCH!! He transferred away from the 2nd most horde dominated server, then has the audacity to shame folks who stayed behind. I can’t believe it, what a small person you are!!
---
I couldn’t care less what the keyboard reddit warriors have to say. I made a post that brings to light a issue that should be addressed, if I wanted to engage the cowards (you) the. I would say “CONGRATULATIONS ON BAILING ON A SERVER YOU LITTLE CARE BEAR!!!”
---
The big bad horde players. You mean the ones you avoided with your transfer??? Man, the irony is ASTOUNDING!!!
---
You're absolutely right, forgive me, most of my tank knowledge came from BC and was refined in Wrath. I was also a paladin, so threat was never my biggest issue, reaching 102.4% and staying alive was. 
---
But you're totally right for classic, as soon as your healers aren't going oom keeping you up, and you can handle the biggest hit the boss can throw out, you need to be full threat.
---
Ahh, thanks for clearing that up.
---
I was trying to figure out the point of that key, i timed flying to thelsamar and running vs flying from IF to TP and its so much faster to just fly to TP.
---
Seems like it's the same from P1 but if the tank gets Feared then she can attack anyone. Tank should be in Berserker Stance start of P3 to get aggro back without getting Feared. DPS without a threat dump should hold off until tank has built enough Threat.
---
As a rogue I DPS Onyxia while jumping up and down under her during P2. I watch for who she targets and if she targets me for a Fireball then I Vanish. Otherwise I Vanish the second she lands P3 and go all out DPS for the rest of the fight. Pretty much impossible to pull aggro after that.
---
I said EITHER *IN* university or first few years in a job where responsibility isn't high. It's funny that you think the average player even played in Vanilla. This game got hyped to hell and back that now most players are new or started in WOTLK+.
---
&gt; its just that the rogues would rather do DPS than limit the damage done to the party.
---
What they don't understand is, that by helping me, they are helping themselves.  If they initially focus on clothies or casters, I don't care about them pulling threat, because they won't die from it anyway; and then once those casters are dead, when they go to the mobs which actually might hurt them, because I have so much threat with said mobs, a rogue can backstab or use whatever other high threat, high damage attacks they like, and never pull.
---
As a result of that, not only is the group safer, but the Rogue goes home with top place on the DPS meter as well.  Everyone wins.
---
The back peddling had me fucking shook
---
You know what I'm looking forward to in phase 2? Logging on less. Game is boring affff. Every noob guild on every server is able to kill the huge and powerful end game boss. Leveling was fun, kinda, now level 59s and 60s clearing raids and getting legendary items just because they stay logged in for 40 hours a week. I'm much happier applying my skills I have acquired over the years of playing wow to clearing mythic + dungeons, level 15-18. Something only 1% of the player base is capable of doing. Killing Rag doesn't make you the best when there are also 1 million people that killed him. I would bet that 10% of players don't even have half of my raider.io score. New wow xpac looks great. Going to be so much better than this boring shit. Let the downvotes begin.
---
So if 60 gold dropped what would you do? Split it.
---
Why does it matter if an item dropped or pure gold dropped if they are equivalent?
---
This happens so often to me as a mage. Tank will moon his mob of choice for sheep. I sheep. It gets broken instantly. I sheep again.  Tank separates mobs from sheep. Sheep breaks. Sheep wrecks the healer. We wipe. My fault for not keeping it sheeped.

Oh so you're the guy spamming trade on Incendius? I know who to ignore :)
---
Im on like 100 anger runs. Saw it drop twice and lost.
---
Just just not get it and focus on other things
---
I’m horde man
---
They didn't let you /roll for it and give it to you if you rolled highest as your guildies? Shit guild tbh.
---
I just have shield-sword defensive, 2h battle stance macros. But also a macro to swap to spirit gear, my spirit set has 170 spirit and out of combat I can heal on my mount or whatever for free. Then a macro to swap 5 pieces of gear back to tank.
---
Hm, I thought there was experience from token turn ins at least? After 15 years, I just don’t remember what was there.
---
So, how much is the white hit DPS increase at 313? Like maybe I’m at 305 with 2H swords, and get a +8 2H Sword skill item? Am I looking at less than 1% increase?
---
This. Pre bis on some sites for warriors is pure defense and others pure hit and crit chance when it should be a mix of both and tailored to your raid group (ex: great healers= less mitigation needed)
---
They can be the same person sometimes. 
---
Me: “Surely this mage isn’t going to try to sheep that mob for a 3rd time on the same pull. I better pick it up. “
---
Targets mob 
---
Mob is now sheep
---
Cannot untarget fast enough for sub 2 second sword to not hit sheep
---
“Fuck!”
---
Mob runs around 
---
“Surely this mage isn’t going to try to sheep this mob a 4th time on the same pull. I better pick it up”
---
I'll be honest, I did wear one piece of leather for a while: Mask of the Unforgiven. It was 2% hit, and I desperately needed the hit to stay hit capped, but once I got other sources of hit, I swapped it out for a plate helm.
---
I agree swords get boring. I think we need bg’s like now rather than later lol.
---
Bonus. You may get the mount before the cape.
---
Yep. You literally have no other options. None at all. Your guild didn't reserve you a spot for a month so I guess tanking sucks and it's everyone else's fault.
---
Say what. There’s a teleport from booty bay?
---
This is how I imagine most players who enjoy world pvp tbh.
---
It slows down at the end. In my warrior in my 30s, I powered through the levels a bit. 3 levels day 1, 4 levels day 2, 3 levels day 3. That's harder to do when you're in your 50s.
---
Ignore the treadmill.  The only thing it will cause you is stress.
---
Focus on making friends, and having good times with them.
---
I'm interested in seeing you use loot council on retail without masterloot.
---
while true, hunters need to have the awareness to actually understand and control their aggro. One of the bigger points made is that bad hunters will get impatient and just start firing off shots before warriors even have enough time to taunt or get enough rage to do any aggro control.
---
If it's mid fight and hunter gets too high aggro in a dungeon, then they can just FD.
---
I know this discussion's scope is kind of at the 5-10 man dungeon level, but you take your argument to a fight like MC or Ony where you have to be really careful about aggro, then you're gonna have a lot of people mad at you for that aggro pull that wiped some of the dps and a healer right next to you.
---
I'll bring a dps warrior to UBRS. I can solo tank the entire dungeon except for Drakk, where somebody needs to taunt him when I get conflagged.
---
I don’t know what to believe?!?!
---
You're just proving my point though. IF she reaches endgame, she'll run with your guild. 
---
What about players with limited free time who doesn't have someone that can join their guild? They'd find no joy in endgame.
---
Single digit IQ
---
Keep a spare pair of gloves and boots with riding enchant/spurs + carrot on a stick is 9% faster run speed :)
---
Literally save 10% of all travel time just by carrying those 3 things.
---
If you want free water, add Niemph-Gehennas and whisp me if I am around. 
---
Hate people selling water...
---
Taunt isn't important if you have enough healers.
---
If your faction doesn't control BRM I don't know how you plan on summoning people. You can't summon in an instance so you'd need the control to be able to summon in the first place. I can't even reset BRD on my server safely without 1 person dying so I have no idea how we would ever summon someone.
---
The best is telling people to /milk a female Tauren for free milk
---
Empty your mailbox and relog, it sounds full.
---
Just make civilians unkillable, whodathinkit.
---
for me, getting to 30 was brutal on my warrior. Then at 30 I got sweeping strikes, and a guildy helped me get whirlwind axe. Quests became a lot easier, and I levelled to 41 or so via scarlet monastery spam, picking up ravager axe from Armoury on the way. And that seemed very fast.
---
You are the one who brought up UBRS
---
All I said is I'm having trouble finding people to play this game with to get progression done.
---
Please be done cause you are confusing the shit out of yourself and it's annoying me.
---
https://i.imgur.com/RiqXbkf.png
---
Or maybe you could follow an attitude of trying to work well with others in a group a little better? At what point is the mult-shot even worth if that's the shitter attitude that you're gonna have?
---
Delete their hearthstone. Kill their character. Run to Alterac, find the house the the tumbled over chimney run up rubble and into chimney. They are now stuck.
---
Don’t know how it works now but at one point in vanilla the only way to get out of the chimney while dead with no hearthstone was messaging a GM.
---
Try gift of arthas.  It's pretty cheap and you alchemist friends should be willing to craft it for next to nothing.  I use it in 5 man's and it's made me really lazy on my aoe threat.
---
Truer words have never been spoken.
---
DPS warriors on average have always been this bad. I can't think of a class and role combination in the game's history that attracts so many people with such horrible attitudes.
---
Even the new mages pale in comparison.
---
It just seems insane to me that MC/ony will be the only pve content for 4 months. People will drop their subs if that happens imho.
---
Indeed.
---
Well you’re on a PVE server, so you’ll never be ganked anyways.
---
Thanks for arguing semantics and completely ignoring substance. Have a good day.
---
Clearly you've never been in the situation where players who've been in a raid longer outbid newer players on an item even though it's a minimal upgrade (or even no upgrade)for them
---
Rogue rolled on mageblade? It's a sword and he's got more dkp than you. Hunter wants a healing leather item for RP set? Oh well he had more dkp than you. 
---
You're issue with loot council is that it's easily exploitable, which is true but doesn't mean it can't be used correctly. Even when dkp is used correctly it can lead to issues like the above that can't be avoided even if people are doing it correctly.
---
I have seen way more dumb hunters who open with multishot (either breaking cc, pulling neutral mobs, or stealing aggro on the entire pack, sending everyone else into a panic trying to salvage the pull) than mages who spam blizzard.
---
Huntards are still the same ol' huntards. Way worse than mages.
---
Of course they dont owe me anything, but respectable companies stick by their word.  This situation is a perfect example of why I had not given activision/blizzard any of my money for over a decade before classic launched,  and now only do so begrudgingly.  You can never trust anything they say.
---
You're right, it's that easy. How was I so stupid.
---
Sitting at 47 on my Rogue right now...so far the 40-50 grind has been the hardest. Mostly my own fault I think as I don't have my mount at the moment, spent it all on a sweet dagger.
---
I am just slowly running out of quests at my level I can do, and the ones that I can do are so spread out that I spend a good portion of my time just running from place to place.
---
BRD first half is ok for 52-55
---
Yeah, thunderclap was allowed in def stance in tbc. It was a godsend for tanking multiple mobs.
---
The main problem is getting initial threat on the mobs. Battle shout and demo don’t really generate much threat, especially for the rage cost. If anyone sneezes, it’ll pull over them which affects your rage gen and is just annoying.
---
There's no ah fees for arrows
---
Tanking isn't for everyone. It's stressful. It's like babysitting a bunch of 3 year olds hellbent on killing themselves.
---
Personally, I *love* it. There is nothing quite as satisfying as watching your 3 dps each attack different targets and all 3 of them unable to pull threat from you. Or getting that accidental extra pull that *every single group seems to get regardless of dungeon* and leading the group to victory.
---
That comment "noob used eviscerate with only 2 combo points"
---
Turn the in game voice off and silently say the messages to yourself in your best warlock impression for the full immersive experience
---
I don't understand, my Atlasloot always showed the 1.12 version of items? What is the news about, didn't we know already that the items will be 1.12 version? Wasn't that already specified around release over 2 months ago?
---
You can have more than 1 hwl a week?
---
Yes, I am.  That I believe has been my whole argument.  If you see something you don't agree with, say something.  The other's argument was to ignore, let it go and move on.  Something which i don't agree with.  Whenever I said ignore and move on I was quoting sparcrypt's opinion for him to move on.
---
Hope you have a nice day.  
---
GL out there and don't be TOO salty.
---
&gt;DM was necessary
---
In what way was it necessary?
---
Good old saggy baggins
---
on an 80% horde server? yikes
---
I'd hardly consider DM it's own patch. It's not numbered.
---
You are a clown.
---
I was 45 when the gates to AQ opened.  I was there with the server disconnects and all that noise.  And I still got full T1 before BC launched.  Looking back, my guild was trash as we'd wipe on all bosses in MC at least once.  I just thought it was typical for the time.  But as a rogue, not much I could do differently in the fights as I was in the top 5 most nights.
---
[here](https://sixtyupgrades.com/set/7XUWzrZp7W8UMiiLQEcECL) you go.
---
Correct, your def cap goes up by 5 a lvl so the 10 def on warden staff is like being 2 levels higher. Not a huge game changer but you will take less hits.
---
Thrash blade is insane. Still using in MC.
---
Glad someone posted the correct response...
---
Yea it makes sense, just wonder why people were saying 12 minutes is enough to not get locked out when it should be 15.
---
Yea, I figure most of the toxic people flock to PvP servers so they could get the "real game" feel of ganking and being ganked. On mankrik I don't think I've seen "spellcleave" once.
---
Then again without legit damage dealers they don't have to worry about threat in the first place.
---
As a programmer 90% of UX requests are stupid to you guys. From UX standpoint of view its excellent to have a mechanic where you could reset quests if you want different items. Just like you can respec your talent trees. That's why you have restore item functionality in-game. The game is not supposed to punish you for such decisions cuz its, well, a game and its supposed to be fun.
---
Well they've made you cry on Reddit. So looks like their goal was accomplished. Gj giving them what they want.
---
Reserving is the way to go, man. The VAST majority of people I encountered didn’t give a shit about SGC and just wanted their HoJ, and since I got my HoJ early on in an all caster group, I could reserve SGC and nobody really cared. People did get irritated though if there were three warriors though, people don’t like having competition and usually want a caster or two.
---
If you log you can easily tell because there is parse per ilvl, meaning that you're compared to people of similar gear. Also you can tell who is using consumables. That's usually the metric for "best"
---
I might just switch to retail until bgs come out. I'm only lvl 37, so I've got no hope now that P2 is coming out so early.
---
KEEP YERL FEET UN THE GRUUND
---
Level 33 human warrior tanking dungeons here. What do I need prioritize talent wise? Currently arms spec, wondering if I need to put points in both axe and sword specialization, also do I need to put 5 points in the fury spec for the extra crit?
---
Gotta do city raids before P2 then...
---
The time per level is massively shorter for super casual players because of rest
---
FFS it's not "all or nothing" you can have a dkp system with guidelines.
---
you think you do
---
Hahhaha me too. 
---
I immediately came to comments because I couldn’t watch anymore. 
---
Could feel the room switch to “hahah funny what’s going on?”
---
To,
---
“......😬.....”
---
Made sense to me, nice little tip :)
---
5% as physical, 3% as caster.
---
well said. rogues are basically off tanks and we can vanish anytime we need to the only risk is the mob will run directly at the healer.
---
This is like...the exact opposite of how it is. In vanilla, a well-geared player can utterly demolish people (especially the classes that scale super well with gear). In retail, everything gets normalized behind the scenes and so you only end up a few percent better than other people even if you are many ilvls ahead.
---
If you ever get charged by a r14 warrior, you'll probably die in one second if you aren't geared up.
---
And to tack on a bit, also remember that even when BWL drops, it's not like MC/Ony are suddenly going to become obsolete. They will still be ran consistently to keep gearing people up and that will last all the way until Naxx. Not to mention that once peoples mains start gearing up, people will start having fresh 60 alts to gear up so even more MC/Ony runs will happen. You've got plenty of time!
---
TIL!
---
you have no idea what you're talking about
---
BOP
---
It seems the majority of this sub doesnt.
---
Threat is better up to the point you risk dying or dps isnt remotely competing with your TPS as a general rule. Some fights you want max mit, some max threat, many in between. Defense cap isnt neccessary or even all that advisable.
---
By the time it would normally have been released 90% of the community would be well past it, with the remaining 10% consisting mostly of Alts.
---
This isn't true Vanilla. Adding low level content late will cause it to be DoA.
---
Fair enough. I didn't really start tanking until TBC when AoE threat was a lot easier thanks to Thunderclap being usable in defensive. 
---
Who knows, maybe I'll get more jaded as I level my warrior.
---
Who would have thought an mmorpg would attract some base level of cringe?  
---
I will never understand those who shit on the way others enjoy spending their time in game, as if grinding dungeons for pre raid bis is some noble calling but having fun pretending to be bounty hunters or something equally pointless is cringey.
---
Why is that relevant? If they are playing that infrequently their time per level may be lower but it’s still going to take them a long time to level.
---
What has worked for the pug we have run the last couple resets is to have the tank and the off tank stack on top of each other while she’s in the air.   They still get fireballed but it does not wipe the off tanks threat.  When phase 3 rolls around have the off tank become the main tank and have everyone wait for a 20 count doing only white damage.
---
Idk man, these pug mages drop like flies after pulling aggro.  The time saved is not insignificant, and I'm at the stage in inventory management where I'm never full on bag space anymore.
---
Dire Maul, Sratholme, BRD has like 3 keys
---
for all those ironman players out there.
---
have a rogue being second on threat. evasion. win!
---
OR. They could just do cross realm BG's because there's literally no reason not to.
---
Yet you're still here so obviously you do lol... Nothing like a guy who writes paragraphs to explain how much he doesn't care. NEET behavior
---
If you're not interested in PvP, you ought to consider transferring.
---
If you're horde, please come to Azuresong.  We have some fun levelling guilds (which sound like it's in your/my wheelhouse) and a few guilds doing end-game 40-Man Raids.
---
Not a problem for bigglesworth
---
I saw someone afk in the chimney. Jumped down so I could afk in there too. Didn't realize you can't get out lol
---
stay away from the blue-blue, mon.
---
STVietnam.
---
Luckily my brother is playing a healer and I feel comfortable chain pulling with him. Usually by the time the last mob is around 50% I can build some rage and mark the next pack.
---
With a PuG healer I don't know, though, chain pulling isn't an option right off the bat.
---
yea patch could mean anything. removing a layer could be thought of as a patch. there is too much ambiguity in blizz's phrasing which is causing these internet arguments
---
“These guys are no life losers! They just sit doing next to nothing in a video game for fun for hours at a time”

What did you do today?

“Spent a few hours grinding for gold for my epic mount and ran 3 dungeons where none of my items dropped, why?”

I didn't choose engineering for videos... ?
---
Tanking is prob the hardest first time thing to play, your husband really threw you into the deep end here lol.

That post is from april and it may change. Why do you post this?

Hi, /u/ICantReadVeryWell

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/drlar7/what_is_an_alliance_side_ring_with_high_stand_and/). 
---
Look 10dps is still dps! Just because it takes all 40 of them to get that high isn't their fault :/
---
I dunno man I been running shadow priest through a few lately and we got this tank who even if go ham with MB we do not pull anything off him and the odd time when we do it's like he's got a leash on em.
---
Wasn't that taken out of the TOS?
---
I had a pretty messy WC run last night on my warrior. We had a huntard who was the epitome of the stereotype. Pet pulling everything, ignoring target markers, pulling groups before me/before healer has sufficient mana, "all gear is hunter gear," keeping growl on his pet, and the last straw was when he tried to ninja a chest while everyone else was rolling for it. By the end of it, me and the healer had enough and decided to just say fuck it and bail before the escort quest at the end.
---
at lvl 3 you'd be spotted a mile away by any 60 though.
---
I'll give it a whirl, but I've had hearth out on 6th reset doing 13min runs, so I think something is up.
---
The most important aspect to me, is that they are still going to roll out AV 1.12 which is probably the worst version of that BG.
---
You wont have big long epic fights in 1.12 AV, it will be just like retail is now: Run along the sides, ignore quests, turn ins, towers, all of it and just bumrush the boss.
---
How fucking boring.
---
Look at this cool dude, wow. You're the best man! Ill give you a solid 5/7, good effort son!
---
The point is it shouldn't be an opener. Wait for the tank to get some threat on the mobs first, or you're just creating a nightmare for the tank and healer for a teensy bit of extra DPS.
---
I loved hunter in vanilla but found it hard to find groups, so now I'm partial to and recommend classes that can fill a couple of roles. As a shadow priest you can dps or heal, making it easier to fill up the group. I am playing a holy priest now. I loved Alterac Valley as a hunter. I find priest engaging because it's interesting trying to figure out which spells are best for which situations. For example, I am finding that in a party of two with a warrior, it's often strongest go light on the damage spells and just heal, but you do have the option to burst things down.  It can make things more interesting to be ready to fill two different roles. I also enjoyed druid for that. Anyway, maybe you should play both. Taking down elites as a hunter working with your pet is quite interesting.
---
It's a caster, it won't beat on the tank, the only thing it will do is spike his health with a shadowbolt (or something similar) ever so often. 
---
The entire point is that one mob not being on the tank isn't the end of the world. When the tank is hanging on to the hard hitting dangerous mobs, and the rogue is kicking and beating down the caster, there is no real danger and everything is running smoothly.
---
You just have to think a little outside of the box.
---
I'm at work lol
---
Gross. If you’re bored in classic why would you play retail? Personally, I never get bored of classic. Plus that’s plenty of time for alt runs too.
---
You always need defense, otherwise why would you need a shield lol
---
0/31/20 is superior to deep prot when it comes to threat generation. But I wouldn't recommend it to someone inexperienced in what to do in each dungeons because playing without tactical mastery can be hard.
---
 [IrregardlessOfFeels](https://www.reddit.com/user/IrregardlessOfFeels/) you sounded like a A+ guild member. i myself went through a hard time trying to get into a top notch raiding guild in vanilla and got into a server first guild in tbc. I run my own guild now   
---
 [MistakeNot\_\_](https://www.reddit.com/user/MistakeNot__/) \- if you want to MT start a guild, every guild starts with pugging. You do a good job at tanking and leading and everyone will follow. Youll have a full raid team in no time.

Or give up and go to another game, QQ

Avoid totems use blessings all in all don't forget to lay on hands

Phase 2 has now been announced to be released on November 12 in the Americas, and a day later in Europe: https://www.powerupguides.com/2019/11/release-date-for-wow-classic-phase-2.html

Dont
---
I’ve hit the same wall...full pre-raid BiS but no one needs another tank for raids.
---
My advice? Sell your tanking service for dungeon groups and use the gold to help level alts.
---
I’m making 20g every run and they usually don’t take very long. The extra gold is making my mage very happy.
---
[H][Stalagg] &lt;Guildless&gt; is recruiting! 
---
We are a relatively new and small guild that is comprised of a group of casual/semi-hardcore in their late 20s early 30s with the main goal of clearing 40m and 20m content as it is released.  We will also be forming BG groups and world PVP groups casually.  The leadership has extensive WoW experience from Vanilla to Wrath.
---
We’re currently pugging MC until we can grow our core raid.  Our goal is to have a solid core by the time P3 is rolled out to push future content. 
---
Our current raid day/time is Sunday at 6pm server for MC.  We have been pugging Onyxia whenever works for the core each lockout.  We currently /roll for loot as we are pugging with no limit on the amount of pieces you can win in a raid.  As we do grow our core and begin to run as a guild, it will be voted on by the raid of which loot system will be used moving forward.  An additional raid day will be added in the future as needed which will also be voted on by the raid when that time comes.
---
We are currently looking for all DPS classes and all HEALING classes.  We also have the need for one additional TANK.  We are also recruiting casuals, socials, PvPers and anyone else that’s looking for a home.  We are a drama/bullshit free guild and expect you to be the same.
---
If you are interested in joining or would like more information, please feel free to message me on discord (Romin#6067) or in game at Romin.
---
Come be a part of something great from the beginning!
---
You know the enlightened centerists?
---
Step 1: bubble
---
Step 2: hearth
---
Step 3: ???
---
Step 4: profit
---
I can't find anywhere that lists how much the the items actually cost.  Anyone have a reference somewhere?
---
If the Shaman is remotely competent, you won't beat them and the fight will last almost forever.
---
Hmm I do not but I can create one, part of the actual video will go over the essentials just so the gameplay isn’t confusing. My build is basic 31/0/20 with alterations that are suboptimal so you should be fine with normal elemental build. Thanks for watching man
---
But did you roll on an east coast server tho?
---
This. So much this.
---
Min/Max, no-lifing idiots and streamers ruined retail, and are now ruining Classic.
---
Glad I held onto that outhouse key!
---
*laughs in short BG queues*
---
Uhh??? I feel like this was removed because a lot of people play both factions??? I have horde and alliance all over my battle.net sooo?
---
The point being that phase 2 isn't going to create more redridge ganking.
---
You'll actually be losing Dps with Hand Cannon compared to Carapace Spine Bow because you'll be clipping Aimed shot a lot due to Hand Cannons speed.
---
I'm going to send my tank this comment and he will cry thanks
---
Now Writed rules of DG.
---
1. Pull after 5s tanker charge;
---
2. Don't pull more mobs cause "the tanker can tank more";
---
3. If the healer sits to drink, wait (drinking are pretty expensive);
---
4. Don't Fear;
---
5. Don't let pet out of control;
---
6. Never Run away cause mobs are targeting u, warn the healer and/or tanker about;
---
7. Keep the boss away from the healer/ranged DPS (Mainly the ones with silence or AoE);
---
8. Avoid pre-heal, shield, heal over time before tanker pull;
---
9. Don't heartstone after last boss, mainly if there ll be another run after u depart;
---
10. Don't "need" itens without group approval, even the green ones (Ninja itens);
---
11. /Roll unlocked chests, /Roll locked chestswith the ones who can unlock too
---
12. Reserved itens need to be respected, don't enter a group to roll reserved itens this is also ninja  
---
&gt;Edit: Just to clarify this. My speed is the healers mana. With proper play the healer does not go oom that fast, thus you can do more pulls before you have to rest etc.   
---
as a healer \[R\]
---
My VW's name is something close to bhorgak, and though my multiple plays of Skyrim I always marry the same woman, Borgakh the Steel Heart. So I roleplay the demon is my husband and something went wrong when he took a summon.
---
I play a lot and i am stuck at 56.  I can only imagine others who have a lot more commitments.    Its a big world plenty of places to grind mobs in peace.
---
Shadowforge and prison key is there a third one?
---
Ask Blizzard, they are the ones making the decision.
---
If I had to choose a Horde race, it'd be a troll.
---
PvP is fine, I probably only get ganked 25% of the time when I see Alliance. Then again I’ve been playing since Vanilla so maybe I’m just used to it.
---
So you're saying that your comment wasn't true and my callout was actually justified?
---
Use a shield, gear for threat and use your abilities right sunder demo shout etc. I quit 2h tanking when I got to mara but with shield and 1h I can still tank everything but 40m raids even in dps spec.
---
This.  I still don't have the cloak and its tilting me but always remind myself I need the rep for later and even now for the shoulder enchants
---
I do this on my mage too.. for some reason the few tanks I've run with never wanna kill/sheep the casters or healers first, so I just take on the roll myself and keep them locked down or will just kill them myself depending on what's left standing.
---
TBH, things that were good farms for me in vanilla aren't worth the squeeze on my current server. Used to farm felcloth like mad and they would sell for 8-10g each. On my current server, Atiesh, they're up for 3g. Full stacks of Runecloth are around 2g. With the low droprate, it's really not worth it.
---
Yeah that's what i did before the video started x) i lose control when the wolves just dodged everything !! xD
---
I think this more about OP missing out on content hype because they are levelling too slowly. This is certainly not true because there are innumerable people who are even more casual and still anticipate being able to raid. Casual raiding guilds exist. People will be raiding content for a long, long time.
---
I disagree that WoW "requires" a lot of time but arguing about it is pointless.
---
So much fun to play on the horde side on Heartseeker, there is no end to how many alliance u can farm, and they are terrible at PvP ;)
---
But that still won’t prevent you from adding them to bnet. Though right clicking their names and hitting “add battle.net friend” might even be disabled. And we aren’t talking about hopping onto the opposite faction to chat. We’re talking about adding friends to Battle.net who play the opposite factions being punishable. Which is insane.

Couldnt agree more. I've joined pugs where the leader would kick a certain player because they didnt have one piece of prebis. Like how the hell is someone supposed to get gear if you dont let them?  This *you are a burden to my time* mindset is getting old. Only bringing it up because it relates to how the hardcore players are treating the casuals. Dont know when elitism became so rampant. Then again I'm new to WoW, I dont know shit, but it's a very fun game.
---
Why would I tank a dungeon from where I don't need gear if you're not a friend or guildie.
---
Is dishonorable kills from lvl 60s camping lvl 20s or from somthing else?
---
I've always got the rank 1 on my taskbar just to get Warriors to stop bugging me when I'm oom.
---
Cool mate, you throw ONE spec in the mix and pretend all classes do 3 times more damage in the current ireration, which of course, you pull out of your ass.
---
Or a Hunter who does not dismiss a pet!
---
what do you mean ?
---
I grind mobs cause i enjoy it.  I dont enjoy random drop quests.   I like quests you can team up with and everyone in party gets credit for every kill but they are sparse on purpose.  Its a grind either way.
---
It's just a single checkbox man, it's not that complicated lol.
---
&lt;3 :)
---
In a level or two, go to hinterlands for some questing. They have a good amount of quests that give 1.5g rewards and once your level 45 I believe you can pick up all the jin'thalor elite quests (there's 6 of them). That will net you some good exp and you can just heal it like you would a dungeon.
---
Nothing is stopping you from farming mobs for gold to level to 60.  As you said, your time is limited.  That won't change when you hit 60, so getting raid ready seems a bit silly.  Depending on your class, assuming rogue, there isn't much difference between 59 and 60 for grinding gold aside from more gear options.
---
Honestly, gold grinding from 59 to 60 is not a bad option.  It gives you a good income while being easy on your time.  And if you can hit 60 with a good stockpile, you'll just have to farm less for your epic mount.
---
H-hey Jwerp, do you remember me from Biology? Freshman year? It's Laura. I just wanted to stop by since you missed the last reunion, I was looking for you. I always thought you were really smart and talented, but I could never work up the nerve to tell you. Anyway, I hope you're doing well...HAHA Just kidding, it's still Tanner you fucking gullible idiot lmfao. Anyway, the gym awaits, see ya man good talk.
---
go get thrash blade. now. Then get to lvl 55 and run BRD until 57/58 and LBRS/UBRS to 60. You need tons of stuff from these places and you might as well get XP while farming them.
---
It's because High Overlord God-Emperor King WoWHead said that Engineering is the best prof because of bombs.
---
Nobody uses bombs, not even the epeen DPS log guys.
---
No it is easier. Just like horde PvP is easier(racials) but one can still prefer to PvP as alliance. 
---
I’ve literally raided both sides and Windfury doesn’t make things easier. It makes things more fun but blessings and fear ward trump windfury. Comparing a paladin who can give his blessing to 40 raid members versus a shaman who can give totem to one group, come on now bud. To give everyone tranquil we’d need eight shaman with one for each group. You can take one single Paladin for salvation. That’s huge. Fear ward also makes Nef a lot easier. I don’t count Ony as she’s a joke either way but fear ward still helps there too.
---
Some stuff was, they removed the relic slot from the hybrid classes that couldn't use wands in like cata or mop, making them all unequippable and grey vendor trash. Only that kinda thing happened :p  
---
Certainly not armor pieces ;o
---
Paladin vs shaman or druid are both fights that can last forever, do yourself a favor and avoid it.
---
Just link a damn source instead of being pretentious.
---
LOL I totally forgot about the +20 MotW FR resist.
---
That’s what I tried to do while leveling.  Killing the mobs is easy and quick and opposing faction are less likely to bother you if you outlevel them.
---
The fuck is this comment lol
---
Unless you are not casual. Then fuck you and only my way is correct to enjoy the game :^)

ME TOO xD
---
Why'd yall roll on a PvP server if you're afraid of PvP?

Yea it corny and cringeworthy, but also kinda interesting. Like those serial murderer shows, you hate them and they are disgusting, but it is interesting to get a glimpse into their madness.

Not gear but I've farmed for somewhere between 25-30 hours for my quiver sinew off the elite dragonking in winterspring.  I'm just hoping I can get this done before p2 otherwise its gg
---
Or could be /seinfeld?
---
Don't take it as me putting everyone who creates content against a firing squad. I appreciate the tips, but most of these videos have this sense of "urgency" as if you're "supposed to be" 60 at this point. That's the thing that irks me the most, otherwise good for them for trying to educate us noobs.
---
Should upgrade to Thrash Blade the quest reward from Maraudon for your tank weapon.
---
You know dishonorable kills are only from killing low level quest givers right? You don’t get them from killing players of any level.
---
In your interface options, you can turn on "Target of Target" which shows you the target of the mob you are targeting. Ie you know what mob is targeting which player.
---
So what you're discovering is an inherent weakness of furyprot. Deep prot has the advantage of snap threat on the pull, being able to use charge rage and shield slam costing only 20 rage, rather than 30. Furyprot's advantage is in sustained threat. 
---
Your dps will have to learn to hold off for 1-2 gcds and then they won't be able to hold threat. And if you're in MC, you shouldn't be aoe tanking, so you can focus all your attention on one mob.
---
How I pull typically is I pop berserker rage, swap to defensive stance, pop bloodrage, then face pull (or I shoot them and wait until they are close before I pop berserker rage). I start sundering up right away, and you can get 5 sunders up in 5 gcd's even if the mob doesn't hit you. If you need more burst threat at the start, you can open with a bloodthirst, but as you saw, that only works if the dps give you time or you have rage pooled from earlier.
---
That's another advantage of furyprot: sunders get up quicker. In deep prot, shield slam is such good threat that you use it every 6 seconds, while in furyprot, its far more efficient to get the target up to 5 sunders, then use bloodthirst. All that armor reduction not only helps your melee dps, it helps YOUR rage generation and threat.
---
The tipping point for fury/prot dealing more threat is around 17-20% and 6% hit. I'll admit, before I got all my gear, I was using mail pieces (and even a leather one once) to meet those requirements. I wouldn't recommend tanking MC like that, but in dungeons with a fairly good healer, you can do it. For now, however, it sounds like you'd be better served staying deep prot until you get a bit more gear.
---
And by the way, whirlwind is not good threat. Yes, its better than demo shout or thunderclap, but 4 sunders on 4 targets is far better threat. The only time I'd use whirlwind is on the pull, but even then its sacrificing long term threat for short term gain.

Reread what he said
---
I think swords spec is better for Humans, though obviously it's going to depend on which weapon you use. I've been considering whether a 2,1,2 in axes/maces/swords is better though. You sacrifice 3% crit for the Moments where you use an axe, and get 1% stun when using a mace and 2% extra attacks when using a sword.
---
Drop the aggro file in the recycling bin and then empty it out
---
It is, since you're ignoring that not everyone has a schedule that allows them to spam 1-1.5 hours long dungeons repeatedly.
---
Unless you're going to invite a level 50 to your Scholos, LBRS, UBRS, BRDs, and DMs for pre-BiS, it isn't really an option. Pretty much nobody will, because there are plenty of 60s running this lower content to get geared. And those that will invite us are going to move a lot slower than those that don't, which then clashes with the above point.
---
Even getting into a group for Mara was a dead-end over the weekend. Had 3 groups dissolve when we couldn't get a healer or tank.
---
Just release BGs at the same time. You'll still have WPvP for HKs, but much less than just releasing the flood gates that HKs alone will do. I don't understand why you'd be opposed to BGs releasing.

If you're really struggling to find motivation, plop your warrior in an inn for like a week and level an alt. You'll come back with a ton of rested exp and will make the next level or 2 go super fast! It always boosts my motivation when i'm getting 500-700 exp per kill

**I already know their exp has been significantly reduced** but it still seems to be a good place to level while avoiding wPVP being instanced, time taken is not an issue for me in this case.

\#Nochanges party has completely failed because of some bugs that were not there in Vanilla. For example, multiple bugs regarding hunter's feign death.
---
I suggest we just suffer, and I will quote what I have said earlier in a post about the same spell batching issue. 
---
&gt;I am up for changing it to 100ms or lower. If you think of it in terms of tick rate, the server on this matter only has an astonishing 2.5 tick rate. In comparison, in any MMO, tick rate should be at least 20. (GW2, BDO, etc.)  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;However, I think it would be hard to get them to change because while they are enjoying the cheaper server, the blind #nochange people and the uninformed are defending for them, and you can't really have a reasonable debate with people that choose to be ignorant.
---
He seems very out of his depth and I think he just got upset because I said raiding is easier as alliance. I don’t know why that offends people. It didn’t offend me when my guild rerolled alliance in 06 for fun. We loved it.
---
Yeah, I played PVE this time around as I have a life and job and do NOT have the patience for the slugfest that pvp servers become.
---
I played for years on a pvp server and it was 90% get ganked while trying to farm or level. Typically a rogue, or several people. Flight path camping was a thing and it was disgustingly boring.
---
I am actually SUPER excited on the server I am on. Population is heavily skewed against my side which means when we DO want to flag for pvp and find some fights, it should be very simple.
---
The way PvP servers operate and most players, it is just a gank fest and people that want to be playing FPS games. They just want to murder you instantly, not have an actual drawn out fight. No thanks.
---
*laughs in rigged AV wins*
---
Yeah, this is one of those rare occasions that I have no problem with a 60 melting him and his 40 accounts.

I'm trying to figure out how OP wanted a *boomer* server and playing on herod was his main problem. Can you help me understand lol
---
Wait do relic coffee keys actually go in the keyring?
---
Keeping tank weapon up to date is important for increased threat. I wouldn't worry to much about tank gear untill 58+ "of the bear" gear will just fine  to tank while leveling.
---
ppl pug MC, but boi, ive been in like 3 pugs and ppl wipe on trash, every time, i stopped joining these pugs and started to make time for guild, i have never ever killed one boss in mc or ony with pug and ive stopped trying, also gl rolling against another 8 rogues and 10 mages, unless youre druid when every raid there is someone different

---
Sunk cost fallacy is strong.
---
As Warr doing green quests and killing green mobs was definitely the fastest way. I basically followed Joanna’s guide a level or two behind.
---
Its just what ive heard, I imagine a lot of new players choose mage because they hear its easier or see some streamer talking about them
---
Good tanks I know had 3
---
Haha wow that is awful, I mean we just want to have a blast kicking ass and we're not stuck up, guild chat can get wild, but it's all about having fun. Screw that Olympus bs
---
Judging by the way he said "with my schedule," he probably means that he has small chunks of time to play. If, for example, you get two hours per night, it is hard to do dungeons because forming the group and starting the dungeon takes a significant amount of time.
---
Whereas if you just grind/quest for two hours, you can make progress each night with little downtime.
---
As a warrior I only did green quests until I got to level 40 or something. Once I got my full toolkit and plate gear I haven't had trouble doing quests at my level.
---
Dude, same.

I hear the /breakup command works or the /beagoodSO works too

Nice thing about LW is other people can craft your Devilsaur Set as it’s BoE. I just dropped skinning for mining and will be dropping LW shortly for Engr. I’d drop LW now and pick mining up and get it caught up to your level (took me a half hour to hit 70 mining). Hold onto the mats you get from mining to power lvl engineering later. Keep skinning and farm your own devilsaur leather if you want (you can start this as early as 53 I think, I waited to 55).  After getting the skins drop skinning and get Engr. I wish I would’ve done this sooner on my hunter.

---
Why so hostile? I used warrior because it’s what I play and it does the most damage. I didn’t say all classes do 3 times more damage, I said -some-. But I did say they do twice as much. You don’t even have to take my word for it. You got a spreadsheet? Put frost mage in with full magisters and of the owl gear. Now put one in with full prebis. Tell me the damage difference. Also don’t ever take talents that give hit because no one did back then as hit was considered useless until way later. Same as weapon skill. 
---
And I’m not pulling anything out of my ass. You can look into this yourself if you think I’m wrong. Compare these items from launch to now dude. 
---
I don’t know why it’s so hard to believe that characters are twice as strong now than they were in January 2005. These changes were so massive.
---
yep, never understood the fear people have of not being the first group to run certain areas. I started 1.5 months after wow classic release and here I am, running every dungeon. leveling up, having fun, making friends, joining guilds, etc. No problem in playing at your own pace. I think it boils down to an immature "beat ya to it" race and ego filler. who cares. if i'm having more fun than you then I'm winning.
---
If they do that there will be a huge spike in queues, that’s true.  It’ll feel like launch again on Herod.
---
Being fury/prot will be able to help you get a tanking spot imo. The other day my guild picked up a few extras for Ony, one of which was a fury warrior. Our MT pulled and tanked Ony through phase one but our Off Tank couldn't get a hold of her after the phase 3 transition, about 4 OT's were fighting for aggro when this random fury warrior pug picked her up, slapped on a sword and board, positioned her correctly, and finished the fight easily. Now this warrior already was part of a guild, but almost guaranteed he would of got a ginvte if he didn't have a guild.
---
My point is this, just because you don't wanna dps doesn't mean you can't be flexible in your build. Dps and offtank for a guild as needed, slowly start getting tanking gear, and once you get an opportunity to MT something, throw your name into the ring. Obviously it's easy said than done, but being an asset to a raid will get you gear and tanking opportunities. I mean in MC alone there are certain fights that require a lot of OT's (Garr, Domo, maybe golemagg)
---
If you really just wanna be a MT, then join a leveling guild that doesn't have a MT, wait until you get enough people to raid (pugging in the meantime), and then MT once you have enough to put a group together.
---
I formed a group for an elite quest mob, otw to it a wand dropped and 2 mages in the group needed it, a hunter also needed it and I kicked him the instant b4 we pulled the quest mob. I don't play that shit.
---
Get a life.
---
Don't you lose a lot not going down to nature's swiftness in the resto tree, or is it not that noticeable when raiding?
---
I agree for the most part, but cmon man, just google it.
---
I never understand why tanks get so upset about people pulling agro. You dont need a tank to do any dungeon in classic wow except the last boss of UBRS. As a rogue I can tank any boss in classic besides the last boss of UBRS. I do plenty of 3 man runs of DM/Strat (live and undead) / LBRS / Scholo. Shits super easy
---

---
The picture "literally" shows a keyring which isn't in wow right now. The other guy was incorrect but not because of some picture.
---
As if it isn't hard enough to get to the BRD entrance now...
---
It's generally not efficient to "drain tank" until mid-late 30's. Until then you're better off wanding as your filler spell assuming you keep getting decent ones, Do the BFD quest asap to get yourself the best one. I personally have used the succubus since getting her as the consensus has been that unless you're going demo and getting imp voidwalker he doesn't really do much of anything, so you might as well get more damage out of your summon.
---
Even with max fel concentration fast hitting mobs will be able to push it back making it not efficient to use until you actually start building up spell power.
---
at your level my rotation was basically, pet attack, corruption, COA, immolate, wand. Even now i'm 35 and don't use siphon life unless i'm fighting multiple mobs, and I don't use drain life until I get down to 40-50% hp and I still have a decent amount of mana. 
---
In terms of efficiency it's far easier to just wand/drink at your level instead of fighting with siphon life/drain life because it does absolutely terrible damage and your time to kill will be way worse than the time it takes to eat/drink.
---
Flying means you can ignore open world PvP. Flying means you fly over everything you don't want to do and just zoom to your objective. Flying means you don't get any immersion in the world as you walk around. Flying takes you completely out of the experience of playing WoW, which is being a part of the world.
---
308 is optimal. If you can get 308 without breaking a leg, definitely do it. Rogues can easily do it with maladath or gloves if they use daggers, human warriors, non human warriors with edgemaster's and maladath etc. Orcs you could really do either, using edgemaster's and axe+dagger or just devilsaur and axes is pretty much the same
---
I thought it costed way more than that tbh. I didn’t know about this and just went for goblin engineering first. Oh well I think sapper charges is all I need
---
This statement is hurtful to pug mages everywhere
---
Is that how melee vs caster dps works with threat?
---
The question is because certain items like the quickblade and healing mace were added around AQ patch in vanilla. Although we have 1.12 items, we don’t have confirmation whether or not the pvp weapons that were introduced later in vanilla will be in at p2, or if they will come in p5 with AQ like they did in vanilla.
---
Yeah.  The difference between some healers is very noticeable 3 or 4 packs into a run.  I'm not sure how some can oom themselves after nearly every pull, but I've sure as shit seen it.  I've also seen healers go a full run without ever needing a drink.
---
Yeah, I do this as well.
---
just play at your own pace, the people who are going in all ham from week 1 will quit before phase 3 comes,there will be plenty raid spots open from quitters in tryhard and casual guilds
---
Sorry I ruined your super secret gold making strat :,(

I’m at 49 now and I know I’m gonna be food for the 60s, but it doesn’t really matter to me. I’m not in any rush to get to max level as I’ve enjoyed the journey so much I’m worried of becoming bored at end game.

If you find it cringe to correctly interpret words I would suggest that you have a severe mental deficiency and should refrain from judging others in any situation whatsoever.

It’s an argument over what they MEANT by “first patch,” not what the words “first patch” literally mean in the dictionary. It’s literally the opposite of semantics. Take your bad faith argument elsewhere, this is honestly so entirely beyond the original point.

Yeah, ruins the immersion and he shouldn't have been included in my opinion.

I raided as a hybrid lol I healed on the tougher bosses and would dps in between. Honestly though never had any complaints on my heals get a lot of +heal gear and practice timing and ur good
---
There is an epic 1h boe mace with +5 defense and like 100 armor. I have it, but don't recall the name offhand because my brain is garbage. It's one of the best 1h tanking options around.   
---
However, pummeler is probably better threat. But useful to carry both because not every fight needs a pummeler charge.   
---
If alliance, there is a mid level green offhand from questing in darkshire that gives you +armor and a 1% chance of doing shadow damage when hit. It's not amazing aggro, but it does technically help. Worth keeping around if you get it.
---
depends,if you are horde you are probably still good,allys will quit in a week after pvp start,they are just not tryhard enough as horde players are

I got bonebiter at 40 and that plus mortal strike was still gamechanging for me.
---
I had no issues leveling until 40 as alliance. I stuck with desolace, hillsbrad, arathi, and alterac mountains. I hit a big roadblock at 41 though. At 41-43, you're too low for feralas and too high for the aforementioned zones. I'm 42 currently, and attempting to kill 41-43 mobs near Booty Bay. Only reason i'm not dying constantly is bonebiter and MS. It's almost surreal that I can kill a mob 2 levels ahead of me while keeping at least 50% health.

Ooohhhhh, I thought there was only 1 type. So I guess truesilver will open almost anything?

---
Top 50 is a pretty small sample size compared to the amount of players running MC. I’d argue those top guilds would be doing nearly the same times as horde, they just are playing alliance. If you keep scrolling through, the rankings seem more 50/50 after the top 50 guilds. Its no surprise to see Progress and APES at the top. I don’t think it’s cause they’re alliance but that they’re really fucking good.

Better to just say that you gotta go, instead of being a dipshit.
---
If you're leveling Shadow is still a decent healing specc until late-game. With the added bonus of being excellent at DPS and survivability. 
---
You shouldn't have any issues healing as Shadow until maybe BRD onwards.
---
Well at least on horde with wf totem. Spamming hs and still having enough rage to use your insta attacks is possible so in a lot of cases this is nothing more than being rewarded for standard rotation

I feel like if you have been consistently raiding for a month you should be in the top 1% of gear already, and will probably catch up to all of your guildies soon as well. Maybe you are missing some Pre-raid BiS stuff, but that's gonna be irrelevant once you get your raid gear.

true but nobody will pug a lvl 52 for brd unless you're a healer. You will need a guild group if you want to seriously grind xp there at lvl 52.
---
There’s no argument for what they meant. They have a company phrasing for the phases and they didn’t used it, they used the word “patch” which has a completely different meaning. Absolutely no one with any logic whatsoever would honestly believe that they originally meant P2. If’s hilarious that you could imply that and then try to point the bad faith finger at me. You’re a hypocrite and also someone who gets way too stuck in their ways over a totally irrelevant argument. What they meant, while obvious, is irrelevant because they were wrong.

---
But that was on a time of creation where no one was following a premade template. Not as much as today I'd say. I dont think it'll be good on the general opinion nowadays.
---
Dude, I get downvoted every time I post against the circle jerk of tanks here but christ, this sub has soooo many bad tanks in it and people that definitely do not understand that bad tanks exist. 
---
Anytime I group with a great tank we can unload right away without a worry in the world. It makes dungeons way easier. Tanks like that seem to be 1/50. The other 49 all have trouble with aggro and ALWAYS blame the dps. Well actually they never say shit in the party chat but I imagine they come on reddit and bitch.
---
You only need like 260 engineering to learn all the gnomish stuff.  From 260-300 is where it gets stupid expensive.
---
I miss playing 3 minute mage.
---
why be trash like this? why not just use your taunt button it's only on a 10 second cooldown
---
don't want to use taunt in uldaman
---
what is this shit WHY ARE ALL THE WARRIORS SO BAD
---
you're in uldaman just spam battle shout and you're good to go as any spec for most of the pulls
---
do your JOB
---
You can also just do 3 man jump runs to farm the herbs and get the 3 Rich thorium veins at the end
---
The DM buffs are strong af
---
Then what is farming in your dictionary?
---
and they look bad ass
---
Dear lord those mobs have long names in french 😂
---
yeah demand for devilsaur is at an alltime low when people realize they can raid in greens :O.  running dungeons is 1 thing but paying hundreds of gold?  nahhhhhh
---
Why? I’m not saying it isn’t but I don’t think it should be. The whole point of the PvP arena is it being free for all surely. If you want to take on the role of a devious sneak who promises all and delivers nothing it should totally be allowed in this instance. Trade etc is different but that’s why it’s protected by game mechanics.
---
And all of a sudden I'm really mad that shamans use restoration to revive instead of a thunderbolt from the sky
---
Came upon a 3 man group waiting for yowler in Redridge,  
---
I said "invite for yowler please". they said nothing did nothing.  Yowler spawned, I tagged him and left them with the adds.
---
If you wipe on it before boss spawns you lose the chance to get him again
---
They also want HoJ and Angerforge drops pre-bis tank pants for druids.
---
Other way around.
---
Got attacked while at half hp by a level 59 warr... nearly killed him with the help of the heroic Burga (lv48). Until a level 60 mage turns up and kills us both.
---
In CoD you instantly respawn with full health and a reloaded weapon. Games are also fairly balanced player number wise. Pretty shit comparison to WoW where you likely are outnumbered, being spawn camped, and respawn at half HP/Mana. Oh, there is likely a level difference and gear difference as well. The CoD equivalent would be playing a 1v5 on the smallest map possible where you are 1 shot to kill and they take normal damage. You get a pistol and they have rifles. Can you kill them if you are better? Sure probably a few times. You're still probably going to die a lot and "lose" though.
---
I personally think people are over hyping it a little bit. There is going to be a lot of pvp going on but I think it will mostly happen in certain hot spots. I think places like Black Rock Mountain will be an absolute shit show, but you'll be relatively ok out in the world.
---
because if your goal is to farm honor, you want to go where the prey is.
---
which is everywhere you're saying they won't be
---
why would they not go there?
---
I think the world would be a better place if everyone was forced to play a healer for a week. The healer should be the one that dictates the speed of the run, if I'm spamming my drink button after combat and only get to 53% mana before the tank barrels into the next pack. Theres no way to "outskill" not having enough mana outside of expensive consumables and even when doing virtually zero over healing and using your down ranks you dont have nearly enough mana to go forever. Mana is a mechanic in vanilla, people need to learn that.
---
I just am not a fan of the ghost room in that instance even with a full group it’s a nightmare this sounds neat but I don’t think I have the coordination to pull it off.
---
but why do this? wtf
---
this is just bad tanking
---
what's wrong with this subreddit
---
&gt;I thought were a bunch of boomers with responsibilities and stuff.
---
Most boomers are retired. I think you need to reevaluate.
---
I get your point, but you can kill like 2x or even 3x  bloodelves in the same time you kill another lvl 55 or 56 mob, so I don't really know if it makes that much difference. The lvl 53 elves still give 210ish xp while even a level 57 or 58 in the eastern plaguelands gives 320ish xp but takes a lot longer to kill and you have to take much more breaks to heal and waste resources.

How does the PvP gear work, Will I constantly have to keep rank 10 to be able to use the gear or will it be usuable no matter what once I purchase it?
---
No, it's just that xD is somewhat controversial. A lot of people hate it, and associate it with preteens.
---
Don't be like me and run around the entire way whenever you have a quest for the harpies.. or as ghost when you died at the harpies.. Take the road in the mountains
---
*Laughs in Rogue*
---
people are very impatient these days. Ignore the whining and just do your thing at your pace. DPS are expendable anyways. Tanks are not.
---
They don't ever think about being the food when they make their character, they only think of feeding on the less fortunate.
---
Angry at a multiboxing level 30, so camping him with a level 60.
---
Irony abounds.
---
You sound awfully entitled.
---
Just tank live side strath runs and reserve the orbs
---
I wish it was possible to filter tags out on mobile. Humor and nostalgia posts are a waste of time.
---
If your dungeon farming you can have someone invite your alt so you can reset yourself after each run. Just log off your main and on your alt and lead will pass after 2 minutes. I use a low level alt to do this and I level him during the wait time for lead to pass. Sometimes I'll stay on the alt for 10 minutes at a time to avoid lock out. Works best for alt 1-10 then you can start sitting them in an inn to get rest.
---
Create a toon on RP realm, level it then read your post again.
---
You're doing God's work.
---
Trying to rank that's cute. There are guilds organising kill trading at graveyards already.
---
Love it 😎
---
I was competing with some guy to get the recipe to actually learn it, plus about 5 other people who would just sell it. I managed to snipe it and made a deal with the other guy. He gives me mats, I make him bags for his whole guild. That way I get a free 20-25 skill levels and he gets what he wanted.
---
2 exp bars in case you're not sure which way to look to remember it's still 8 hours of grinding?
---
Hahaha 3 min mage already comming back. Man thats nostalgic
---
Thanks so much for reintroducing me to flintlock, I love it
---
My experience was that you could form a group if you advertise that you're doing the early bosses. The 60s won't join, but that's fine.
---
only a few? on EU
---
25 realms layered
---
18 realms unlayered
---
p2 is going to be a shitshow :)
---
I have an alt on Kurinaxx and found it to be very good, active population with lots of players. However I can't speak to its Horde/Alliance balance, so not sure how balanced the higher levels of play are.
---
By the time your mage hits 60 you could've farmed over 5K gold which assuming 50g/h doing jumpruns for 100hrs which is fully reasonable.
---
Your commitment to being subpar is great
---
I just want to know what people are carving into their pumpkins
---
I did a Strat UD run the other day that took 50 minutes flat, all bosses. The tank was good at pulling minimum possible at a time, but would leave when the mob was 10-15% HP and go for the next mob while DPS cleaned up. As healer, I would find moments to drink between pulls, if possible, and drink through the first bit of the fight, only standing up to cast max lvl greater heal on the tank as he hit 35-40% hp. We stopped for a full drink only before bosses.
---
We were all 60 with mostly pre-raid BIS so it worked out and holy shit was it a good time. Stressful, but felt like an achievement.
---
I did this as well. Luckily I was able to vanish and get the first eggs, but after I finished all my (his) eggs, I left. 5 minutes later I saw him yell "F this quest, and F all of you."
---
I'm guessing he tried and failed to steal from another person, or someone else stole from him.
---
The benefit of the 3.30 crossbow is that the auto shot timing perfectly allows every other shot to be an aimed shot without any interruption. 
---
It's a perfectly timed metronome.
---
Doesn’t telling people what you farm just diminish the value of it because people will just mimic you and then undercut you?
---
Wait, really?
---
We have actually been able to duo the DM east jump run, this is more to farm the mind tap pre bis since it’s an optional boss that doesn’t drop any additional loot.
---
The couple warriors I talked to about that said it's doable but such a pain in the ass they stopped bothering after a bit.

I got level 60 just at the end of the first month so I was and am "ahead of curve" when compared to the general population. The issue with phase 2 and arguably even how the game is post layering removal is how much longer and harder it already has become to level. I'm level 55 and 37 on my alt's right now and trying to do quests is near impossible not even factoring the pvp in; the density of players is just too high to support questing. Quests that I could finish in the span of 10minutes or less are now taking 3 or four times as long due to mob competition. I feel bad for any "casual" player attempting to level now and in the near term because while they are already going at a slow rate they will be forced to go even slower due to the combined factor of the honor system and no layers. 
---
The reality is if you wanted to enjoy the game by doing open world questing that literally will be eliminated as an option, and I'm saying this as someone who did level back in original vanilla; the increase in server pops has been really harmful to the experience people have been trying to chase. I don't blame content creators at all for warning people as they are right it will only get worse than it is now. The time it will take to level will double or triple for people who aren't interested in sitting in dungeons all day. People trying to play the game as they want are victims of blizzard rushing to remove layering, which is the real problem and secondary the pvp piece which compounds the problem.
---
Realistically what's it take to hit rank 10?
---
The server is technically capable of hosting that many players, but the actual world is not capable of providing a decent experience for that many.  From the beginning caps in vanilla were a design decision, not a technical limitation.
---
Blizzard didn’t explicitly state they were lowering caps when layering was removed but very strongly implied it in a blue post several months ago when they opened up transfers.
---
What's nice about TSM is that it scans the AH automatically.  I don't do much with it but the basic features (tooltip etc) work well.
---
Once you purchase it you can use it whenever even if your tank drops.
---
I mean if you're standing around all day shooting at people from the safespot nobody can reach without walljumping or whatnot I would call it griefing. But if you're literally 3 m from me in the same room and I can easily get to you or run away, that's just world pvp in my book.
---
There was a mage who tried doing this to me. I wasn't targeting anybody at the time so my target switched to him casting Frostbolt immediatly, so I turned around, ran to him and hit him with Windfury, which made him jump away. He jumped out of the safe spot and aggroed guards, while I waited until I left combat and exited peacefuly. Needless to say he stopped attacking people from the safespot after that.
---
Multi-shot rank 1 is basically an extra attack for 90 mana. It’s absolutely worth it.
---
You won't be able to farm honor. The minute a 60 starts ganking level 48s then a friendly 60 will come and fuck them up. So sure if they enjoy 'farming honor's by constantly getting a kill and then dying by all means that's part of the game.
---
what about new classic servers after a couple years for people who want to refresh while keeping the existing servers?
---
I've recently switched to engineering, and so far while I enjoy the utility, I've found extremely limited opportunities for making money. In your experience, is it worth spending the money to learn the Sniper Scope recipe, or will I basically never recoup the cost? The recipe is going for 50-60g on my server, and scopes are going for 3-5g, but that really doesn't leave a ton of room for profit so I'd have to sell quite a lot to earn any money.

---
Yep, look for the torches along the path
---
This does not work, a much higher level doing damage to your mobs severely reduces the xp.
---
The best way right now is to get a full group of lowbies and one max level to crush the instance as this lowers the average level and gives you close to full normal xp.
---
I have two accounts with twinks on one and my main on the other and my typical leveling Strat is (my main is a Druid) have him follow the twink out of group and keep them healed up and just chain pull mobs killing them with no down time.  For melee and my lock this has been incredibly effective.
---
Gregariousness. I don't know this word, can you please explain?
---
I thought Ony attunement stuff started at BlackRock Spire.
---
Which BRD stuff are you talking about? I just wanna make sure I'm not missing anything, I'm level 59 too.
---
My commitment to my life is great. My lack of interest in making WoW a lifestyle is great.
---
This video just screams Early 2000's at me lol. Hurley shirts, backwards hats that were to big for your head, and puffy skate shoes. Better times... better times.
---
42-45 was pretty rough for me. After that I just healed ZF, mara, ST, and BRD runs to 60.
---
People will hold your hand for you if you're nice and humble, but being the way you are now will make it incredibly difficult. I can see why people aren't giving you "slack" with your shitty attitude.

Server: Razorgore
---
[Ravens] is a guild that raided casually from Vanilla until Mists of Pandaria. We're now reformed and we're looking for chilled people to join us in our journey through current raid content once or twice a week. You'll be at or approaching level 60, and not too sweaty.  
---
Have a chat with one of our officers in-game if you would like to know more!
---
Would be great if someone with Skullflame could tell us if it procs on spells casted on you. If it procced on dots ticks as well... it would be amazing. Paired with a lifestealing 1h like the ZG axe it could be great in later phases assuming lifestealing effects scale as I think they do. Considering it also has shadow and fire resistance, but not a lot of armor, I would basically consider it as an anti warlock shield that I would swap to after using my medicine pouch (if you don’t have it I really recommend you get one it’s amazing against locks and spriests). 
---
Also Skullflame is kinda common now because of all the people leveling and tanks buy it for lack of a better shield but later on it’s basically only good as a niche shaman shield horde side. Not to mention it would really come together with high spellpower and healing power so, we might find it’s not good for now but good with AQ gear. By then it would be a rare sight. 
---
I hear you about style though. Ele Shamans are great for this and the Mail and the Disk are definitely cool items. Personally I have the Hand of Edward the Odd and it’s spectacular for sure. Managed to get a Tidal Charm one week after launch as well, it’s not that flashy but it’s super deadly on an Ele. Out of curiosity, what are those items you’re targeting? I’m healing in 30/0/21 and don’t feel like it’s hindering my gearing in this patch, except for cloak/rings basically.
---
If you're decently geared you can fairly easily 2man BRD arena with a mage who needs Ban'thok Sash (it's what I did to get mine).
---
By all means you do you. However the jumper cables have a 30 sec wait time after it is equipped, a 10 sec cast, and a 30% chance to work. If my class has a revive I rather just drink for those 40 seconds.
---
When you make remarks like this, do you pause first and think maybe people found situations where what you say is not always true?  Or do you just assume that they're an idiot?
---
So my static group is typically a rogue, mage, priest, shaman, and a priest or lock.  I’ve generally tanked every dungeon as a rogue at level.  Are 60 dungeons that much different that I won’t be able to do this anymore?
---
We’re doing ST and maybe some of BRD this week so I’m going to get a taste of some late game dungeons soon.
---
You should be topping Onyxia if you remember mana pots/ demonic runes, and have good pet control.
---
Hello fellow first timer. I completely agree!
---
Yeah that is fair. We ran it twice in a full group and it was a nightmare because we had 4 melee so the aoe damage was huge. I was super hesitant to try it duo but I wasn’t as bad as I thought, just a little trial and error. I alternate this and duoing brd arena for my warrior friends chest piece.
---
WSG will be dropped early, just like DM. They are going to get flooded with complaints.
---
Good lord this is nonsense.  If you pull threat as a hunter and it gets out of the pack, the tank is no longer hitting it.  The odds of the mob then turning and beating the shit out of the healer are remarkably high at this point.  Generally I assume if the hunter pulls something out of the pack he can deal with it, but bad hunters kill healers and other ranged dps like nobody's business.
---
Wait wait what are you talking about?  I played the nerfed av a lot and all we ever did on purpose was kill the guy at the second biggest building and then lol the bus at the biggest building. What did the towers do beside distract people?
---
I found it would get agro on some pulls, do you not have this problem?
---
Ahahhaa for that exact same quest, in the zone you have to farm eggs. A duo rogue/mage went by and took an egg at my feet while I was fighting for. 5 minutes later I stole a chest they were fighting for AND solo tagged the escort quest instead of joining their group. #pettyrevenge #DontTakeMyEgg
---
I'm working and didn't feel like looking it up. Take it easy.
---
it's not that bad as a warrior too, i'm convinced most of the players crying here just aren't pressing their buttons. i cannot relate to these frustrated tank experiences at all
---
Massive exaggeration and missinformation. Its sort of like how many people initially think you need fire resistance for MC.
---
Some packs are skippable, but get asspulled often.
---
Still a dick move to say "probably" and pull it
---
Yikes is all I can say.
---
If I get bored of classic I'm going back to ESO. Retail is literally the last MMO I'd play.
---
this is how we did it on pservers as well. my old guild runs this strat still and it works nicely
---
I’m married to a rogue, her 300 lock picking comes in very handy.
---
There were two versions of the PvP gear in vanilla. The second (and much better) version was added in patch 1.11 with the launch of Naxx, except for the R14 weapons which were upgraded in 1.6 (BWL). In Classic, the PvP gear that's available from the start will be the final version, not the first version that the game originally began with.
---
Which btw is a huge fucking deal for general game balance, but they've refused to answer any questions about that or acknowledge the fact that they're basically making gear that's on par with T2.5 available in phase 2 (granted, it'll be the end of phase 2 before anyone has it, but still).
---
Hm, that's a great point
---
&gt;In the third phase, we’ll introduce the first Battlegrounds: Alterac Valley ([version 1.12 5.9k](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/alterac-valley-in-classic/128908)) and Warsong Gulch, alongside with their associated vendors.
---
No, I am reading the blue post.
---
In a guild that takes 5 hours to clear MC maybe.
---
They also stated that content would be released relative to the phase that corresponds with the patch the content was released. It’s as if you never read or comprehended the blue post that outlined their intention for content release.
---
You seem triggered.  Need some attention,  kiddo?
---
I've seen quite a few "seasonal" mmos. For the sake of the community, forcing the old servers to close and pushing the population all onto new servers is important.
---
Keeps community identity together as a whole.
---
How can I become part of this? This was my dream guild.
---
Wow your able to kill a few lvl 29s. Well done!
---
Nope. It's not that people dont know what to do, they usually just dont want to make the effort to do it.
---
Was browsing reddit and made 3 comments simply saying playing wow in general is pretty cringey so its stupid to call out other people for having fun doing what they do.  Any other comment was a direct response to a reply like yours.
---
Its just a complete lack of self awareness to call these guys losers while also playing/reading/posting about a video game.
---
Open a ticket and please post the results
---
Good meme. Insert "But why" meme as an answer.
---
Humans have a racial for weapon skill, which increases hit. At least, that's how I understood it. Swords and Maces get +5 weapon skill, does that not convert to hit%?
---
In addition to what hallucinatory frog said, you want me need to make two things from no mesh, the Bob battle chicken and the death ray everything else can be bought
---
I watched a character named "Healingtouch" who shift-clicked as a Priest sit in Barrens chat for 15 minutes spamming "LF Healer WC then G2G"
---
So same as these warriors: why sit and spam and wait when you could just switch spec and pick up one of the thousands of DPS out there, and then go right away?!
---
It's weird though that this doesn't work with Clearcasting, you always get charged for the 2nd spell.  It's like they hacked together a fix for this specific interaction but no others.
---
As a Druid main I love doing this too and usually heal them, drop an innervate if relevant and bear charge in
---
My friends list doesn't show my battle-tag friends anymore. How can I change this? No idea what went wrong here.
---
Spoken exactly like someone who hasn't been show much love in their life.
---
Yep, and you know the people critiquing are some of the biggest gankers ever.
---
People grinding dungeons aren't hindering anyone else's progress. Gankers are making it harder for other people to enjoy the game. This honestly feels like I'm explaining why sharing is important to a kindergartener.
---
It means you get a key ring now.  Also, should you manage to rank up in PvP, you can start to purchase PvP gear that is unlocked with rank.  That won't be easy though...it means you have to find people willing to fight in the open world.
---
Sup brah.
---
Tailoring - Early on Robes of Winter Night, and recently Felcloth Gloves sold/sell very well.
---
While it's still a huge task, it's kind of overblown by the community. These days, the process has been perfected to such a degree that you can actually do it while having a job, school or social life (one of them, not all). Plenty of people have the time it takes to do it, most just don't enjoy that amount of PvP, or they've heard it's basically impossible so they don't even try. In reality, people on private servers have been able to do it with like 10-12h/day or 16h/day with weekends off. Without BGs to inflate the honor gains of premaders, it might even be easier than that in Classic.
---
Leveling on Herod as an Alliance was bad enough the first few weeks.  I can't imagine what it'll be like in P2 when there's actually incentive for them to kill you.
---
I’m also confused that OP’s post history puts him as a horde player so...
---
Price on my server is generally around 50-60g. However there are a few people trying to skyrocket it to 70-90g. Idk if it's having success or not. As I don't buy them, just offer my transmute services.
---
So it doesn't matter if I am flagged for PvP or not?
---
With Dire Maul opening, it got easier to gear up for sure....the funny thing is how often I get drops for opposite specs.  Run as a tank?  Hammer of Grace drops and the healer doesn't need.  Run as healer?  Ata'lai Spaulders of the Monkey drop and no one else needs leather gear.  No complaints...just funny.
---

I'm a hunter, and I can tag mobs super quickly when they spawn, so any time i'm working on a kill quest I try to invite people around me so we don't compete for tags. I saw another hunter standing at a named satyr spawn spot for a quest in Felwood, whispered him "Do you need this guy?" and invited him. He declined my invite, then when the mob spawned I tagged it and tried to invite again - declined. I ended up still being there the next time it spawned and tagged it again just before his pet got to it, feign death and he had to kill it otherwise it would have kept attacking his pet. While FD'd I said "shame we aren't in a group, then you could get credit for the kill too :/ guess we'll just have to compete for tags"
---
Definitely the biggest petty asshole thing I did but in my defense the mob drops an item that starts a quest that I wanted so I would have killed him again until I got it anyway, and I ended up grouping with a few people who needed him every time after that until I got the drop!
---
Harsh, maybe, but if I spent that amount of time leveling and gearing up only to get REKT by lower levels, I'd probably just read a book or something.
---
I'm itching to play more boomkin-like as well, but I don't want to have to respec regularly between heals and boomkin, so I was trying to find an even ground between both..........
---
I'm leaning towards the first build myself, if only because my main focus is PvP anyway and I just hit 60 but I don't think I'll be raiding multiple times a week.
---
This. Just add an authenticator to your account.
---
&gt; You send T2 to the Elemental/Enhancement Shaman
---
Only after Resto has their T2 3piece, which they'll basically be using throughout the entirety of vanilla content in fights that involve heavy use of Chain Heal.
---
I baited you with a misspelling lol. Haha
---
Jokes aside. I've been extremly lucky with this guild, having joined 4 weeks into their raiding and that no other Shaman really goes for T1. Since most sane people want healing + for better heals. Me? I want the supporting role!
---
And of course, extreme luck on the drops. First week, 3 items, second week 2 items, last week, 3 more items. I'm honestly guessing im gonna get hit by a truck due to this luck.

What does this has to do with anything? This is directly talking about the WSG and AV rep vendors long.
---
So because he’s with experienced people that means he can’t need on Matts he can use? That doesn’t make a whole lot of sense to me.
---
That was a symptom not the cause. It just made it happen faster. If you were willing to transfer off when the chance presented itself, had free server transfers happened the people quitting and re-rolling once they reached their breaking point would have happened. You can’t blame people for jumping ship to a better experience and maybe turning the tables around.
---
I hope things go well for you both, or you're in deep trouble!

I saw a RTV in the yeti cave in winterspring and as I was making my way over I saw a dwarf hunter running after it as well. I did what any undead rogue would do and assassinated him in the cave and low and behold the node had an arcane crystal :)

You kill enemy players (no more than 10 levels below you) and you get X honor for each kill. After reaching a certain amount you’ll rank up. Small gear rewards at lower ranks, but higher ranks have really good epics. Wowhead will probably have a more in-depth guide on everything if you want specifics
---
That's fair, and I didn't consider that because I'm on an evenly split server (Krommcrush).
---
This is true and I didn't know about this until lvl 36 when I went through here to go to desolace for the first time.
---
40v10? &lt;Laughs in sapper charges&gt;
---
I hate fish so I’d rather starve.
---
Payment first is not against the ToS. Breaking the agreement is
---
Look for Timeworn Mace in DM West, drops off Prince. That’s the 1H “tank” weapon we Druids love to use in PvP because, hey, 1H weps
---
If you are pulling aggro with screech your tank sucks.
---
Cross faction collusion and thus communication is NOT against the rules. Read the ToS before saying what is against it. You won't find any mention of any of this being against the rules.
---
I know you think this is how the fight works. The part that is a little more complicated is when you say “let the tank pick up the boss and wait for threat” it’s not that simple. Onyxia cannot be taunted, maintains threat throughout phases, and clears MT threat during phase 2. In many cases your MT will not be able to “pick up the boss” until over half the raid is dead, because they don’t have enough threat.
---
the 8pc shaman bonus is so insanely overpowered compared to other classes
---
aside from main tank gear funneling, this is the only set of gear that makes sense to funnel into 1 shaman at a time.
---
Work on professions in your downtime??? Yo, if your group has time to work on professions while y’all just sit around INSIDE a dungeon then ya, you’re going way too slow and people are going to get impatient.
---
Yeah lets ban people because they're ganking. Only sissies like you will be left in the end.
---
Once you get it you can lose your rank. Most people get to Lieutenant Commander and then quit because anything past that wasn't worth the time you needed unless you had a really high population server or insta-queue bg's.

Mining Thorium in Burning Steppes and generally obeying the rule if you see a person mining a node, do the polite thing and skip past it for the next one.  Literally have done this for a couple of weeks now and for the most part, have had zero problems with it.  It's just simple mining etiquette.
---
This past Saturday I had the same Tauren Warrior run-up to a Rich vein I was mining on 7 separate occasions attempting to steal a tap, he never managed to succeed but it was a very impolite thing to even attempt to do.
---
Now if I was alliance I would have just killed him outright but being the same faction I had to get creative.
---
I stop actively hunting for Thorium veins and set about finding some alliance in the zone also mining and I poke the proverbial hornet's nest, stealthily robbing them of some nodes and being seen running away.  After about 10-15 minutes stirring up the alliance I led them to where another horde miner I had grouped with was following the Tauren, Within minutes I had the Tauren dead and camped, sacrificing my own farming in the process, at least for Thorium.
---
I logged onto my lvl 53 mage and went and picked Gromsblood in Blasted lands while checking in with the horde buddy who tracked the Tauren for me to lead the alliance too, basically, the Tauren was camped for almost 2 hours.
---
Okay, Ive been trying to get satrys and blackcrow? (the LBRS bow). I need to go back and get the mara ring. Blood mail boots sounds nice too, good call. I know deep prot isnt the optium tanking build, but I was told here that I shouldnt duel wield tank until I start getting raid gear basically. 
---
Which is the craftable  set?
---
&gt;We don't wanna Google, YouTube, or WoWHead it. 9/10 times the noobish questions we ask can be answered in 25 words or less.
---
"We"? No... *you*. **You** don't want to spend your time looking something up, but lots of inexperienced players are willing to find the information they need, because they know they aren't entitled to someone else's time. Also, you don't *want* to? Yeah, welcome to the club! Most people are focused on what they're doing, and they don't *want* to type out "25 words or less" to everyone who can't be bothered to type those words themselves into a search bar. You need to check your entitlement, bud.
---
I remember...
---
in the long, long ago...
---
I did a Scarlet Monastery instance as part of a group that, out of desperation, used a hunter's pet as the main tank, with very liberal amounts of CC. It definitely wasn't super smooth, but it was hands down one of the most fun dungeon runs I've had
---
I think horde was around 30% of the guilds that killed KT, pre patch.
---
thank you
---
nothing you can do, same issue as yesterday, server problems
---
this has been happening way too frequently
---
Didn’t you jump ship?  Your complaining but posting that your horde previously?
---
“
---
I summoned Eecheyakee and a fellow horde (troll rogue) ran up and tagged it.”
---
Look, I didn't play a rogue in vanilla. The one really cool impactful thing I can do now that I couldn't before is kick. If I'm not directed what to attack, I'm picking the most mage/priest looking thing with a Mana bar and staying on it until it's dead, or can't cast anymore for some other reason.
---
I agree 100, yet it is still refreshing compared to retail.
---
&gt; Would it be an overreaction to switch to a PvE server and reroll a character considering I’m level 36 and phase 2 will be out in a little over a week?
---
Yes. Remember how people said layering would be the end of the game? Remember how that turned out? You'll be fine.
---
This is why people with start ganking in groups of 5 and more.
---
Okay cool. Our pug has been having tons of issues with the transfer to p3. It seems like the raid leaders are trying to get the aggro back on the mt when that just isnt possible. So the result is they dont allow anyone to attack for minutes and then by the time the main tank gets aggro back everyone has wiped because we all just stand there doing nothing getting feared into the lava walls. I'm gonna bring this up with the raid leaders and I bet it will be much smoother.
---
Clear speed is mainly just dependent on the groups mana especially the healers.  I don't always wait on a dps mana, but if we got 2 mages and they're both completely oom I will wait a good 15 secs cause I want the pack to actually die lol.  As a tank though, my enjoyable runs are with a mage that doesn't cast blizzard on the pull.  I get to hold 5-8 mobs the whole time with perfect threat, I end up with solid damage on the pull as a tank with thorns/trinkets/swipe spam and everyone finishes the pull at reasonable mana levels.  Contrast that with a mage going blizzard, cone of cold, 4 arcane explosions, while the pack may die 8 secs sooner you are now completely oom and likely pulled threat so the healer burned half their mana on you.  So now I gotta wait for over 20 secs for both to drink.  Mages:  Don't be that guy.  If you want to blizzard, give us a good 5-10 secs, not 1 second.
---
Okay I didnt realized you could even have two of the rings. I'll start running those tonight.
---
Your guild doesn't understand Ony fight mechanics then. 19 manned Ony last week..
---
I had odd too and I surprisingly have been disappointed. It’s definitely cool when it procs but it always seems to proc when I’m oom or already killed someone lol, and I have adjusted my playstyle to auto a lot in between cast. Either way it’s a fun and great item. Well my dps is competitive so that’s not the problem, I’m just not wanting to deprive my caster guildies out of their BiS like mana igniting coed and ring of spell power, or the resto shamans on aurastone because I’m not trying to min max my dps like others just get pvp gear. That includes t2 helm and pants and band of sulfuras, the only thing I have yet to get is talisman of ephemeral power. Tidal charm is amazing I’ve been trying to get my hands on it for some style plays I’ve had in mind but I have been unable :( What server do you play on ?
---
Sell mithril casings, they're needed for a quest in ungoro.  Also sell salt shakers.  Engineering is not great for gold making.  I would not pay 50-60g for the sniper scope plans.  You'll probably make more gold by selling ore/bars from mining.
---
One time I uploaded a screenshot with some important spells bound to the F# keys and caught so much flak even though it was my keybindings for my mouse -_-
---
As far as dual wield or 2-h tanking the trash. It’s all about your healer.  If you get a seasoned healer that can deal with the extra damage that you will be taking tanking without a shield go for it.  But be sure to gauge this on a per run basis. Not every healer is created equally.
---
mid-late Jan is my bet.
---
&gt;why would i work so hard to get rank 14 so I can get a blue pvp set that has worse stats generally than my pve gear?
---
Because it does not have worse stats. And you get the blue set at rank10, rank13 has the epic set and r14 has the epic weapons.
---
Level 24 warlock - wand is feeling pretty bad (greater magic wand) looking for a new one.  Also any dungeon I should be running soon?
---
Thank you for killing a warlock, you made this world a little better.
---
in vast majority of situations which weren't primarily my fault (multipulls etc.), if I played better, the group stays alive. I find it more helpful to dwell on such improvements than focus on the mistake of a player who's behavior I cannot change anyways (in the setting of a pug).
---
He meant the set items, which the blue set is rank 7,8,10
---
they're rushing to remove layering because the community demanded it. The original plan was for layers to be more prevalent throughout Classic, iirc.
---
You don't get aimed shot til 51 going BM first. Even then it doesn't matter that much since aimed shot won't scale that much at that point anyway. The raw dps on that will last him til he's almost 60 anyway.
---
This is the perfect level range if you every wanted to know how a furbolg feels been killed over and over for rep every time they spawn
---
and Kazaak and Azurgos

It's a book picked up in Dire Maul that starts a class quest for a blue tinket. Every trinket gives +10 Fire resistance and some other effect. The one linked is for priests. So either you farm for the book in Dire Maul, or just go buy the book off the AH. I've seen the books sell from anywhere between 50s and 30g(depending on which class), but I bought my priest book for 25g, did one run of DM:N to turn it in, and got a significantly better trinket for healing. Like I said, the shaman trinket is technically worse in terms of +healing, but the fire resistance makes up for it. The priest and druid trinkets are unquestionably better. Farming briarwood reed is just not worth it as a healer if you have just a small amount of cash laying around.
---
Keep trying you can get in.
---
If raiding isn't your thing it's gotta be build 1 all the way. I would imagine you could probably heal anything fine with NS and a bunch of +healing gear anyway.
---
This post was approved by people who take screenshots with their phone
---
Some of the pvp gear is insanely good for pve. Rank 14 gives you weapons, 12 and 13 the epic sets. It is most important for warriors since many of their PvE best in slots come from ranking. These are also insanely good in PvP for some classes but PvP gear comes for PvE in most cases.
---
Do you just travel around reddit looking for post you dont like and ask people if they need attention? Looking at your other posts it seems like you do. 
---
Like the most childish, nonsense way to try and belittle someone's opinion. Enjoy sitting on your imaginary high horse white knight!
---
I never heard of someone that enjoyed the 1.12 AV.
---
R14 is weapons, r12-13 is epic set, r7-10 is blue set. 
---
Now compare again
---
Why does everything have to be so completely all or nothing in your eyes?
---
^ we have found him
---
Very good wand in Blackfathom Deeps (Quest)
---
I'd like to know the proc rate with 8 piece. On some private servers t1 was bis most of vanilla cause the mana back on 5 piece could proc in conjunction with 8 piece as well etc. 
---
I got 6 earth fury atm but I should finish soon depending on drop rng of course. We have loot lists and some went for raw healing but I valued t1 high so they front loading me.
---
I know what he meant, but that doesnt make it correct.
---
I just made a warlock for the first time (&amp; it's my first Classic alt!) so I was just hoping to get some clarification knowledge out of you. When playing against undead, does that mean when they WotF the first real fear you immediately follow it up with death coil? Seems like the reasonable assumption but always appreciate further insight!
---
I know it’s a dick move, I will wait till someone engages a mob, bring them down to low health, then let whatever mob they are attacking kill them, just to make sure the dirty alliance take durability damage.
---
Warlocks can and do solo farm the drakestone, but it really isn't worth the effort over waiting for the AV rep offhand.
---
Sorry but this is /r/classicwow and if you don't wait 3 sunders you are going to be downvoted.
---
When doing Arena runs on Warlock, do I have to dismiss my pet each time we jump down?
---
I think the login servers are down. I am having the same problem, but my friend who logged on earlier is still in-game.
---
Bots
---
PVE is free
---
Dont expect invites if people don't want you when you dont fit the quota then
---
I probably would have hung myself.
---
Thanks. Unfortunately the paladin one seems pretty bad at only +20 healing and some armor. 
---
Will ride me over though so thank you.
---
If it says requires weapon, yes.
---
Buying non-bis twink items seems kinda risky. Why would you use peashooter when you get better bow from wailing caverns?
---
So why are you here?  What's the point of being so vitriolic?
---
The whole point of killing low lvls is to get 60s to come.
---
Good gear = holy shock, bad gear = BoSanc?
---
STA / CRIT / Glove equip / Set Bonuses / Don't have to raid and can pvp to earn it.
---
99% of my groups at 60 go extremely well, It's on my alts at the moment where I see some of the worst play.
---
Dunno, mate.. Not seeing many people offering sugestions either.. Dunno why all the hate.
---
Dunno, if that is their source of fun in an open enviroment, that it should be fine ?!
---
Internet dragon stuff that bads do because they can't fight.
---
This is hilarious
---
Does setting your hearth while casting actually work? I’ve only tried once and it didn’t work for me.
---
Hey look everyone. Another person thinking about themselves
---
Wow ok, I'm just using DoTs and shadow bolts.  Don't even have Siphon Life.  Man I'm clueless.  Since my SB does 300 dmg with criticals up to 700, it never occurred to me I didn't have optimal dps.
---
Ya for sure. nades in pve is really for the luls or just crazy mage aoe kiting where u need the stun maybe
---
Yeah.. Our guild is pretty good, doing all content in 1 day.. But we wish to improve further and have a 2nd core for those that feel left out or can only raid in Weekends..
---
Then don't do your rotation. I don't whirlwind when there's a sheep next to me even though it is my best global.
---
Good work!
---
Sounds like you want a private server, not classic
---
Or they can keep it as a consequence for griefing and people who wanna do city raids can just eat the honor loss it's not a big fucking deal.
---
Unfortunate that mana burns still take mana in form. Even in pve.
---
At 33 keep working towards mortal strike.  Most of the good 2h leveling weapons will be axes.  So even if you are human with the sword/mace racial, take the axe specialization.   Once mid 50's you can think about respeccing to prot and then you should focus on getting a good weapon that matches your racial.
---
The crit from fury is nice, but not at the cost of adding 5 levels until you get MS.
---
Eh, he pulled his weight and killed Onyxia with us right before the MC run.  The fact that he's level 55 and already attuned to MC and Onyxia...he earned that loot as much as any of us.
---
Farmlog is not showing item drops or vendor values u/bov1ne
---
Shield wall rotation and burn him down.
---
I use my chicken pet everyday for the same reason. My tanaris escort was painful. Over 90 minutes of waiting and ghost running for a quest that gives very little xp &amp; gold. Tooga is also awful along with just about every escort quest in vanilla
---
I'm not getting consistent results via Google.. but can someone elaborate in the time it takes to get pvp gear?
---
What rank is required for the blues? How long will it take to acquire them - how many hours to get a full set? 
---
I don't think I'll have time for purple's, but I also would like to hear estimates.
---
I like to call out pointless spam shitposts because they're annoying and I want them gone.
---
A lot of the questions are questions you don’t realize you have until it comes up. I’d rather type a quick answer than pause my dungeon and wait for someone to alt tab into google so I can be smug about it. The other alternative is that they don’t ask at all and end up causing a wipe. Context is everything, but unless someone wants you rattle off their entire BiS list for them, there’s not a lot of contexts where answering a question is any burden whatsoever.
---
If you don’t want to be asked questions, maybe mmo is the wrong genre.
---
Definitely state to the group that you are new to it and haven't run the dungeon.  I'll just tell people to point me in the direction if its a new place.  Best thing you can for tanking is really recognizing if the mob is casting try to line of sight it so it has to run to you.  Sometimes charging into the mob can pull the next pack too so generally I pull packs back to me if I have no idea what the mobs do.  As a tank you'll have alot of power in the group.  If you happen to leave it could take them a good 30 mins to find another tank so that should make them play nice to you for the most part.  If you just talk in party asking for advice about whether you need to los a pack or charge in you should be fine.  Pugs wont like the silent tank who sits there for 30 secs and never says a word but if you're talking, you'll be set.
---
it changed in TBC i think
---
It is the bis aoe tanking shield in the entire game, nothing can replace it
---
Well your current one is 60% faster than you are. The Epic one is 100% faster.
---
Same. The group that managed to tag him wasn't able to take him down. Instead of helping, we just stood by and watched them die so that we can tag him after the wipe.....yeah, received some pretty angry whispers afterwards
---
Fire resist gear is a trap, it's only kinda good for druid tanks and that's it really
---
aye, same issue here
---
this is something I don't understand about the classic community... I've leveled multiple healers, did a shitload of PUGs, and even back in TBC, there was always an agreement between the tank and the healer - if somebody is acting like a fuckwit, warn nicely first, not so nicely a second time, and if they still can't pull their shit together, *just let them die*. 
---
durability damage is a wonderful teacher, and all but the most boneheaded assholes quickly stopped pulling aggro after that... and if not, it's corpserun time, baby.
---
Do you not understand how it works? 60s raid darkshire and kill all low lvls. This causes alliance 60s to show up, which is the goal.
---
How much does your proc hit for? Mine is 28 on average
---
I think what he's referring to isn't a lack of game knowledge, which is fine. It's when you see questions in chat that are easily google-able that it bothers other people. 
---
Before you ask trade/world chat a question, at least try to look it up yourself.
---
am i wrong but didnt this use to happen in vanilla? i remember being a stealth user and be like "hope they dont get me" in a wipe and sometimes it would and sometimes it wouldnt
---
Because the first cast will always cast UC if none of the other criteria are met
---
Condense it into a single /cast, with the portals first and the teles after
---
Yeah I just mean the basics of tanking, I'll pipe up if were going the wrong way, or if we missed something, idc about that.
---
&gt; Only after Resto has their T2 3piece, which they'll basically be using throughout the entirety of vanilla content in fights that involve heavy use of Chain Heal.
---
In a deep Resto build, 8-piece T1 is generally a stronger choice than 3-piece T2.
---
If you've got +600 healing, then your HW5 will heal 1249 for 173 mana (7.22 hpm). Your CH1 with heal for 1706 for 247 mana (6.91 hpm).
---
Deep Resto Shaman do cast Chain Heal - but not all that much when it matters. In situations where you need a lot of Chain Heal, you almost invariably need a lot of Prayer of Healing - which means your deep Resto Shaman are tank healing (which is really what they're spec'd to do).
---
Given that, it makes a lot more sense for your Elemental (and sometimes Enhancement) Shaman to equip 3-piece T2 and help out than it does for deep Resto Shaman to swap out 3 pieces of their T1 for T2 so they can Chain Heal in situations where you don't need much healing.
---
You also have to consider that you don't just have an endless pile of gear to dole out. Given the choice between having your deep Resto with 8-piece and your Elemental/Enhance with 3-piece vs. everyone with a muddled mix, the former is a lot better.
---
Post on point!
---
Why are you bringing a shaman that isnt a healer lol
---
Man, you need R10 for any piece of the set? I guess I can say goodbye to that lol.
---
The sad thing is, 1.12 changed all of this.
---
Warlocks are still not exactly #1, but they are certainly not mushrooms anymore.
---
I'd say we're closer to "World of Warriorcraft" than anything else after 15 years of min-maxing and the late vanilla fury rework.
---
At 50, you already have access to 2 pre raid BiS items, both from Mara.  Get the blackstone ring off princess, and the quest to kill all the kahn's for the Mark of the Chosen trinket.  
---
For your 1h weapon, there is also the quest you get for killing princess that awards Thrash Blade, which is still usable at 60.
---
ill go back in time 2 months ago and let myself know , thanks
---
Prepare to be disappointed
---
no changes
---
I honestly dont remember, it was so long ago.  Back then i only worked part time, so i was pvp'n at least 6 hours a day or more.  My friends who did the rank 14 grinds (one of my friends actually did it twice, the madman) were pvp'n at least 14 hours a day or more, for months.
---
&gt; And not many BRs can afford $7/month sub fees
---
This is like 2 600ml beers, everyone got beer money, what.
---
Was that... PoM Pyro? Is it already time for that again!? I’m wet
---
The cave to the north east
---
Was repeatedly running MC the pinnacle of a fun and enjoyable gaming experience you had hoped for?
---
It varies in your crit and hit value, which makes the answer less clear, nut good spreadsheets - which fight club discord should have - will account for this, and probably even spit out the weights evaluated at your current syat level. At your stats, I would imagine 1 crit is worth a decent chunk of stength (between 9 and 12 if I had to guess but Im not confident on this), as the marginal crit should increase flurry uptime by more tuan 1 percent.
---
Pretty much yea. If everyone greeds, it makes no difference from everyone use need. Just self-preservation against the real ninjas.
---
Your mileage may vary on this, since rested XP is more valuable at higher levels and having a high level character will save time by funding necessities for your alts.
---
Yeah nah that warlock was just trying his luck to take the item from you even though they didnt even bother to roll for chest. Fuck em
---
How do you get that third row of abilities!? I’ve been trying to figure it out since I started playing!
---
Doesn't sound super impressive since at 60 you're done questing....
---
Axe is better, youll be using them while out in the world all the way to 60 and can tank dungeons just fine without the sword talent.
---
The 5% crit in fury is great and you should definitely get it as well, I went for that one first. Some people like to rush mortal strike first, up to you really.
---
If killing a civilian is considered dishonorable why not just avoid killing them?
---
Do civilian npcs even get aggroed when you get close?
---
Hmmmm so there's a LOT of utility going on there.... nice heheh
---
Or when you run raids on cities, you don't join the main raid.  Only the people in your raid or party get the dishonorable kill.  Not everyone in the region.  You are either in the group or have done damage to the mob to get a DK.
---
This right here is the truth. Even if you don’t have a tank spot in a raid it’s great for flag carrying and pvp if you have a swap macro.
---
I just sat through a 2000 queue and got disconnected after going through it. Back into 1400th place..
---
Well IDK, I've never been camped in Classic so far and I've killed / been killed a lot, especially in areas like STV, Tanaris and Badlands.
---
Sure except you have a raid of 60s raiding darkshire/redridge until the alliance 60s show up and then you farm the 60s.
---
In a world with so much suffering and pain, its great to see people come together to create something beautiful.
---
It just melts my heart. ^^^^and ^^^^my ^^^^face
---
I start every dungeon w/ a tank I do not know w/ my PvP stuff on to test their aggro capabilities, its a lot easier to hold back like that for me, and If I still pull I have 4-5k health to manage
---
FYI, your email is visible.
---
True, sometimes it procs at the wrong time, also when grinding mobs I usually don’t use the procs to keep my mana regen up. Gotta say though, in PvP when it procs it’s usually gg. I auto a lot too, I think it’s essential for Ele, and I like the hand cause even if it doesn’t proc it’s fast and causes good spell pushback combined with rank 1 searing and flametongue (although in this particular case I’ll usually use windfury to get more procs). 
---
I thought the talisman would be reserved for mages/locks tbh, had no idea it was considered a PvP piece in some guilds. I think there’s no way I get one in P1/P2 unfortunately, and I still haven’t seen it drop once :( 
---
Tidal is super versatile but I’m guessing you’re thinking of rofl one shot combos, it works really well for that haha. Since it’s off gcd, against some classes you can actually get a LB first and then CL&gt;Shock, you’d just avoid that against classes that can kick/silence then purge you. But honestly sometimes it’s best used to initiate a kite (especially now without trinkets it can be hard to create distance) or get 2 LHW off. I’m playing on Sulfuron-EU which is the biggest French pvp server, the Prince has been camped by some alliance tryhard guild for a while now but I got mine 8 days after launch on my 2nd kill, my launch goal was basically rush to lvl 38 and camp the prince and it worked out, luckily.
---
Dungeons will be the way to 60. Getting to brd will be tough but all good once you get into the instance. Can hop out reset hop back in!
---
Undead strat has beaststalker boots, carapace crossbow, a hunter polearm, cape of the black barron, and beaststalker pants.  For the most bang for your buck, UD strat is worth a few runs.  DM west has a quest that gives you your BiS hat just for completing it, and a great leather belt drops off the tree boss.  DM north has your BiS 2h wep, barbarous blade, as well as BiS ring and a really nice chest piece.  
---
If you get lucky in one UD strat run, your gear can make a huge leap of improvement.
---
Which player base are you referring to? If you are referring to the *entire* playerbase, then yes of course. But most of the players who have yet to set foot in a raid will *never* set foot in a raid, so including them in your count in inappropriate.  
---
Of the players who will regularly raid throughout Classic, most have already begun raiding and raiding is their only source of viable upgrades (ie raid logging.)
---
&gt;Show us some love, rather than sarcasm and remarks that we're ruining your experience because we don't know all the ins and outs. Practice gregariousness.
---
Examples?
---
I was obviously implying by paid transfers, anybody can transfer anywhere after paying a fee.
---
Classic don't need no stinkin Shadowlands! We make our own!
---
2.8k crit in SM on herod.
---
Parry that you filthy casual.
---
Yeah the ONE tank drop I got was Atalai "shoulders of stamina" that have bonus armor and 20 stam.  Just as good as atalai of the monkey IMO, especially considering I can offset it with devilsaur or other DPS pieces.
---
You should farm ZF up to 50, and in your late 40s get some mara involved as well
---
Some people get off on knowing more about the game than others and find it’s more fun to shit on a player who caused a wipe because they didn’t know something than it is to take 10 seconds answering a question. There’s nothing you can do about them. Assuming you aren’t asking people to give detailed breakdowns of stuff, it’s okay to just ask. Everyone runs into assholes from time to time, but most people are having fun playing a social game and are happy to help other players. Hang in there.

There have been plenty of Vanilla private servers with active communities that have been running for years even after all the content is rolled out. Inevitably, players will get bored and stop playing eventually. Having Naxx on farm is probably not too exhilarating after awhile.
---
However, new players will start playing as older ones leave. Ideally, the amount starting to play is near the amount leaving so the overall population stays the same.
---
My hope is that Blizzard doesn't rush to release phases. I can picture phase 6 coming sometime in 2021, but time will tell.
---
Alliance outnumbered us 2:1 on my server in Vanilla and honestly it was great.  Forced everyone to be much more tight knit as a faction.  There were always roaming groups of 60s who were looking for action who kept things somewhat safe.  The Alliance was just a big, slow moving zerg.
---
I'm Horde again on a massively skewed server (probably 3:1 Horde:Alliance) and regretting my decision.  I didn't realize Horde was the faction of choice in retail, unlike Vanilla.  I can already see signs of the Alliance banding together and making due with the numbers disadvantage, just as we did in Vanilla.  Quite honestly they're kicking our asses.  They camp the hell out of BRM every night, and I see a hell of a lot more dead horde than alliance.  Eventually the zerg wins, but it's literally just a numbers game.  They're better out of necessity.

Civilians can get hit by AoE.

Its the wow head equivilant of grand parents asking questions to specific people in FB big posts.

The actual incentives have been in game from the beginning. Crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and hear the lamentations of their women. The first 2 are done in game, the 3rd is done via this subreddit in posts similar to OP's.
---
A good level appropriate wand does more damage.  apply immolate, CoA, and corruption then use your wand, mob dies.
---
If you want PVP that's only ever in 'fair fights' you should have rolled on a PVE realm. No one else, certainly not on the opposite faction, cares what you want. Unfair numbered fights and camping lower levels is part and parcel of what it means to roll on PVP servers.
---
&gt;this isn’t retail, slow is fine.  
---
&gt;Screw that with how short the tank shortage is, just tank, everyone should just tank.
---
I don't think retail/classic has anything to do w/ wanting to get done a dungeon in a timely fashion, mostly based on available free time.
---
Winning is having no one to play with?
---
Soooo do you feel that making like 10 (that I've seen so far) comments saying the exact same thing here is in any way cool or respectable?
---
Underrated comment.
---
&gt;DPS pulling aggro
---
DPS pulling aggro is insta kick from any raid, l2p.
---
It'll be tougher in the open world,  yes,  but at 52+ you can level almost entirely with dungeon runs,  so you can take steps to limit your vulnerable time.  Works both ways as well,  remember,  so if you're on a server with imbalanced factions, and happen to be on the bigger side,  you may find questing on some areas easier as all enemies will be driven off or avoiding.
---
just edited. To go from 7-10, you will need to PvP for about 30-40 hours a week for 6-8 weeks
---
Absolutely.  I got it on my first ST run and I couldn't believe my luck.
---
Now...if I could just get Slaghide Gauntlets to drop from Urok, it'd be golden.
---
battle shout is still fine, demo shout was bugged/broken/op but i didn't mention it at all, and you definitely can ignore a lot of mobs that you decide to taunt btw, you prioritize building actual threat on other mobs, and only taunt what's going to die soon/not cause too much problem to the group
---
if your shadow priest is pulling aggro then that mob is probably dying in 3 seconds yes? or a casual power word shield will be enough? or frost nova? or kidney shot? a lot of skills your dps can use to handle themselves
---
too many warriors in this subreddit with no sense of urgency, no mechanical knowledge, blinded by their wack ass cloudy idea of how vanilla tanking apparently should be (one mob at a time???), refusing to adapt to realistic tanking scenarios, they make QQ posts here and jack each other off
---
Now I'm not sure and I'm not able to check for quite a few hours. I'll have the check again later. And maybe get some cheap pieces of Nature Wrath greens and test with them.
---
I’m the kind of tank that enjoys playing a support role, and helping groups become a lot more effective, by holding agro, and keeping them from harm so that they can use their abilities. 
---
In turn not all groups are supportive of tanks. Where the tank is simply doing their best to make it easy on everyone else in te group. Most of the time everyone else in te group is doing their best and making the tanks job as difficult as it can be.
---
You know how every once in a while you get a tank in a group that really stands out? Maybe you add them to friends? It’s somewhat rare but occasionally it happens. It’s the same thing with dps. I rarely get a group with good dps, that know how to maximize damage, minimize threat,interupt, peal casters from healers, CC, focus target, LoS, or avoid pats/ass pulling. 
---
It’s just the name of the game. Not all tanks are noobs, yet a lot of them are, most rather dps, but as hard it is to get tanks, it’s just become easier for everyone to elect the closest thing to it, to run in as a meat shield and smash their buttons. A word of advice is to stop complaining about pugs, it won’t get you anywhere, and instead build up a friend list of trusted players, and use your guildies.
---
Coming from someone with a lot of tanking experience, if you are a raid geared warlock, and your opinion is that “pulling agro is just what you do” then I will let you die. It’s up to the healers to keep you alive after that. I am not going to chase you around, fighting to pull agro off of you while losing threat on all of the other mobs I’m tanking. If you can solo the mob go for it, but I’m not going to jeopardize the healers and other dps, because one player repeatedly can not control their dps.
---
As far as I know the blues are catchup gear and won't be available untill naxx.
---
For a full epic set you'll need yo get r13.
---
If you play casually don't even bother, however if you're up for the grind expect to play non-stop between 2-3 months.
---
A lot of times they do immediately ban them. But they just make new ones. And the thing is you can buy subs with gold so it doesn't cost them anything.
---
Decursive is in addition to not a replacement
---
you are the tank demand they stop or be kicked
---
or you leave
---
tanks are valuable dps is replaceable
---
That is hotfixed, no longer works, I just tested 2 hours ago...
---
See, I saw this about the SM route but I could never get it work. Guess I’m just dumb lol
---
R10 can be obtained by casual players. Its just a few hours per day.
---
If it is a named mob connected to a quest and someone asks to join for a mob, I sometimes oblige them and join up then will disband right after. The contextual message can be before or after an invite is sent out, as long as there is one.
---
Generally though, no, especially on grind quests; you get significantly more xp while solo grinding and if you can efficiently solo there really isn't a point, you now have a chance to losing rare loot drops (yes I have been in the scenario where epic loot drops and lost it to some random person that joined up with me for a short time), you lose half of potential item drops like cloth and vendor trash which will net you a loss of money.
---
All in all, I don't get offended by people randomly inviting me, but I will not respond to anything without context. Same goes for IRL, I won't accept someone's discord or social media invite/friend request if it was presented in the same fashion; with no context or prior communication. I don't think that is irrational.
---
Ok, was doing all the rest except I used SB instead of a wand.  The first wands I got missed all the time and did very little damage so I quickly gave up.  I'll reconsider using one.

---
Thanks, I've added 3% to the post above. 
---
What are your opinions on Ban'thok's Sash vs Barrage Girdle? I can't think of anywhere else to get %Hit
---
I can't decide whether that saved Talent Point is worth the reduction in Armor and Spell Power
---
Shield block gives +75% chance to block 1 attack in the next 5 seconds. Improving it by 1 point blocks 2 attacks in 5-5.5 seconds.  So with 1 point in it, then (provided no parry-hasted attacks from the boss) you get +75% block chance for every hit from bosses with an attack rate of 2.5 seconds or slower.
---
The other defence/avoidance stats you'll have, with a little bit of gear, will add to more than 25%, so you'll have 100% chance of blocking the boss's attack or better. This means that the boss cannot crit you, because the boss can only crit white hits.
---
It's worth noting that when a boss parries a melee attack (only attacks from in front of the boss can be parried), it resets his swing timer. So a boss could in fact hit you more than twice in a 5 second period if he gets some attacks parried. So melee attackers need to attack from behind the boss to prevent parries - this both keeps the tank alive, and improves their dps.
---
Even if melee attackers stand behind the boss, the boss can parry your own attacks. I assume that the people who have calculated putting 1 point into improved block feel that the chance of your attacks being parried is low enough that it can be ignored. Having weapon skill reduces the chance of the boss parrying your attacks, so weapon skill is almost a weak avoidance stat (mainly it's a threat stat though).
---
Why play gnome but use an illegal add-on to make yourself undead? Just play undead.
---
That's a good question, one that I aim to answer in the next few days.
---
#nochanges
---
Yep haha.  I'm always willing to tank first, but when I'm not high enough level to comfortably tank the last few bosses, and a warrior 3 levels above me only wants to dps, it really grinds my gears.
---
Everyone wants to use bombs until they realize it costs gold to do so
---
Yes. The only abilities that do not are shield bash and shield slam.

I'd do that but I couldn't give a hoot.

Yeah they're hostile to Horde, i ran through the Dwarven area to reach Badlands a couple of days ago
---
Low level Alliance players panicked and ran like hell when i passed their town heh
---
Better yet, move forward so you drop from zep, don’t jump
---
Thank you for this!
---
\-a healer
---
I meant, people claim that the quicker proc means BT does the most damage of all pets, while ignoring the low attack damage, and ignoring pet abilities (like boar charge or wolf howl)
---
Even then, one could argue that the 1.0as Wind serpents at lv60 are better because they also get a ranged focus dump that deals nature damage (lol whats armor??)
---
But gear farming is instanced... Worst case scenario youll have to corpse run 2-3 times and start the dungeon 10 minutes later
---
TSM (TradeSkillMaster) is so much better than the other AH addons, and also shows the DE value of items :)
---
innervate is such an awesome ability. I've used to run with a feral druid and a frost mage when I was a newbie priest, and they did just the most wonderful trick with it...
---
whenever someone was OOM (which happened often, especially to me, since we sometimes took on dungeons underleveled and it was crushing blows galore) the mage would run in, freeze the mobs with frost nova, the druid would shift out of bear, throw up an innervate, then shift back in and resume tanking, sans an OOM healer. such an easy fucking trick, yet it was truly a sight to behold.
---
Because those players already started on the US servers and all hit lvl 50 when the BR server came tru.. So they made small comunities inside the US servers.
---
Now they're scared of moving to the BR server cus its literaly DEAD.
---
No. Extra attacks of any kind cannot proc other extra attacks.
---
The catch up mechanics back in the day weren't as accessible as retail. There'll always be people to do ilvl appropriate content with you.
---
The only concern about p2 is pvp servers will become more hostile as the game will reward you for being a dick to the opposite faction. But classic is an enclosed community, so there's consequences. The community will adjust to ganking being a lot more appealing.
---
LOL false
---
collateral damage is fine, after you win just blame your enemy.
---
Yeah, and ally players quitting definitely has nothing to do with horde camping every graveyard, flight point, quest hub, and dungeon entrance above level 45.
---
How are Shaman players handling their totem keybinds?
---
Leveling a Shaman alt and I'm seeing that there are around 22 or so individual totems. Do you not keybind the ones not used in pvp like windwall and stoneclaw (maybe?)?
---
i have bitch ass friends
---
you're probably right. I wouldnt mind not being the MT just for the simple reason this is my first raid ever as i just started WOW. So I wouldnt mind learning the ropes a bit the first couple times. I'm on a smaller server where tanks are very hard to find. The other tank I think was also recruited to tank, so maybe the higher up guild members just dont have any other tank options. Either that or theres another tank I dont know about.
---
If you ever group up with anyone you also get "credit" for their DHKs, and even one DHK can set you back significantly. This means that if you are trying to gain PvP rank, you can't be grouped up if you attack cities and towns, because when your groupmate tags a civilian with their AoE you will lose rank progress. You also can be griefed if you group up for quests or protection in areas near enemy civilians "in the wild."
---
Yes it will be as boring as always.
---
And download the addon called Auto-carrot, if you have the gear in your bank, it will auto equip it, and when you dismount it will put the normal pieces back on :D
---
Slay them all! For the horde!

In this thread: people im going to be ganking.

Honestly with that kind of attitude its amazing how he doesnt get banned for trying to deny players access to the game. He takes this game way too far in every aspect.

&gt; As far as I know the blues are catchup gear and won't be available untill naxx.
---
Incorrect

&gt; That’ll change once phase 2 rolls around and we add the Honor System, which will introduce Honorable Kills, Dishonorable Kills, and PvP Rank Rewards. The items you earn from the PvP Rank Rewards will be the versions from patch 1.12.

You can test it by using a mouse over macro to apply sunders while targeting something further away to avoid autos.

You seem to know a lot about this server. Tell me, what is the population balance like?
---
Good news for you, hunter is probably the best class to play if you like solo play. If you're not raiding, then for your BiS:
---
Ranged weapon is a epic gun you can buy. Gloves and pants are devilsaur which you can farm or purchase. Rings, chest, and melee weapon are all from solo tribute chest and king. Both trinkets (or three if you're horde) are a quest, although one requires UBRS. Neck is a quest line you can easily solo. Helm is a quest in but in DM:W but again, at least its gauranteed after one run, and a great belt and wrist drops there too.
---
So really that only leaves shoulders, cape, wrists, belt, and boots as best in slot that you will need to do groups for.
---
This BiS set you can easily do tribute runs for dumb amounts of gold and get your epic mount and 2x any profession no problem.
---
you're noting going to see single 60's you're going to start seeing 3-5 of them, have fun dealing with the rogue, priest, warlock combos that were running around the last two days ganking.
---
You know flagging is a toggle on PVE servers right? You know out-of-game forums like reddit and discord exist right? Nothing at all is stopping you from communicating with the opposite faction and setting out a 'fair fight' PVP event at one of those locations. Who cares if it happens organically or 'naturally' or w/e the hell you think makes it 'Classic'.
---
Blizzards dates every release date to a phase EXCEPT for the keyring. Yep. Makes sense.
---
Now I'm thinking of some wacky ST runs where it's a party of all druids and rogues and you just spam kill the 6 troll minibosses and then fight over the gear.
---
Who runs Gnomer anyways lol?
---
You are literally walking proof that that is not the case.
---
BR players are a small demographic on a non-F2P game. Of that demographic, many choose to play on regular NA servers (especially when there's no ping difference) so they can play in larger populations/better guilds.
---
I don't know why you're surprised. It'd be the same case as if they made a French-Canadian server with same ping as NA servers one month late. It'd be a dead server too.
---
90% of this sub are scrubs who are clueless about the game.
---
Don’t waste two months in UBRS, you wont even see dal’rends mainhand to roll on it.
---
&gt;What rank is required for the blues?
---
Assuming you just mean the set pieces, it's boots/gloves at 7, chest/legs at 8, helm/shoulder at 10.
---
&gt;How long will it take to acquire them - how many hours to get a full set?
---
No way to tell for sure. Will depend on your server's PvP involvement. I never went for higher levels without BG play, but rank 10 (Lt. Commander/Champion) will probably require about 6 weeks of 2+ (again depends on your server, could be a lot higher) hours PvP.
---
5 full clears. I have 2 Epics... one of which no one wanted.
---
If only discombobulator wasnt bugged and dismounted players properly id rank that over death ray.
---
That's not what I said lol.
---
Healers being a couple levels under 60 isn't honestly a big deal there. Resists/melee, sure...lower than 58/59 starts hurting, but the only real downside to a marginally low healer is a slightly larger aggro bubble. 
---
I avoid groups that have high requirements. In my experience, they're asking for them because they suck.
---
I guess. But even then i dont think they were completely removed from the game. You cant equip them but certainly people still can have them in their banks
---
I’ve done 3 weeks and I’m 6/8 with drillborers/Ony neck/blaster shot. Feels good man
---
The ganking will happen in choak points like stv. Players will respond.
---
If you don't want to get ganked, download Spy, level in Dungeons or quiet zones.
---
Joe rogan, it’s a meme that he always speaks about DMT to his guests
---
As a lower level warrior (43) how good is +1% hit on a item?
---
I was doing some ARMs runs... The helmet **Raging Berserker's Helm** dropped. Some people made a comment about how they wore that helmet until like level 55.
---
Off the top of my head I have a plate Helm with double to armor, and more stats.
---
I mean you have access to like 300 summons per round trip. You should have plenty of time to organize farming between those.
---
I'm under the impression this should be expected. The dumbest thing can wipe a group and sometimes it just happens. But I guess certain people feel entitled to their time (which is their own choice). But being ugly towards someone else is childish. Most of us are adults we should act like adults, not succumb to our emotions like 5 yrs old. Oh speaking of I have this 12 yr old tank on my friendlist and he you would never know. It's awesome.
---
Laughs in Rogue
---
Okay so unrealistic for me if I want to maintain a healthy relationship, my job, and my home, while including raiding.
---
Beware of the boat to dustwallow marsh my alliance friends. It’s gonna get ugly
---
Wands are a weapon skill, you have to level them.  Once they are level capped they wont miss much.
---
&gt;because one player repeatedly can not control their dps. 
---
It could also be the tank that cannot control their tps, I don't think this always the dps fault mentality on pulling threat is accurate or fair.
---
*cough cough* Make the meme specs viable by themselves anyway if they continue with Classic+ 😂
---
It was still the same game though. The process was all the same, the results were all the same, you were just forced to restart sometimes
---
I imagine he took the Rez sickness.
---
Can you elaborate?
---
Well, good thing then is that I have a warrior alt that was going skinning and mining (to get mats to the profession my hunter would get) and I have a nice ammount of copper ore! So what I should do is go skinning + mining til around 35-40ish and then mining+engi?
---
Dunno why your post got all the hate train this is a change I think is perfectly reasonable and I'm disappointed no one gave you any serious responses.
---
YES. As a warrior, fucking yes!
---
Leveling 50-60 mostly instances isn't bad, I did it anyway (except here and there) to get some of my prebis - something you'd likely have to do at 60 anyway. I wouldn't worry too much about it.
---
Big facts
---
Yeah I would think by level 59 you have been in enough groups where you would have been booted several times for needing on mats, or at least pissed off a lot of players.  At that point you are just trying to play dumb to get free mats which is not cool and I wouldn't have any patience for that.
---
Well yeah the system is utter trash. But pretending that BiS lists dont exist for retail is absurd. And people are not necessarily chasing it as titanforge. They are chasing the base version. It just will happen that other items will titanforge and you dont need the base version anymlre
---
We are 100% positive that it does.
---
Man, I love that *spicy* attitude that i supposedly triggered pretty hard. The constant all caps and the triple question mark really laid it out there for me to make me take you *so much more seriously and internalize the point you are trying to force everyone to see*.
---
There are certainly mobs in brd that are AoE'able, but that doesn't necessarily mean they should be. I also wasn't implying that *no* AoE should be used ever in BRD. It's not that no AoE should happen, it's just alluding to the fact that a lot of the time, AoE can lead to a lack of coordination if aggro slips even a little bit. It's gotta be precise and it with that it'll go by smoothly. If chaos happens, people will blow cooldowns, unnecessary brain power and stress, while also wasting more mana on skills to ensure either the tank/party wont die, or the necessary kills need to happen - The vast majority of players I've dungeon'd with aren't careful, they're sloppy, and don't care what they pull. 
---
I guarantee you there are people out there that are mindlessly AoE'ing their lives away and likewise there's group members that are covering up and making up for all their shitty aggro pulls and mistakes.
---
Also no, back in vanilla we didn't aoe nearly everything. Vast majority of dungeons involved at the very least a sheep or banish and that's reasonable. Traps and Saps typically don't happen much now nor did they happen as much back then, just occasionally. 
---
I don't even think everyones saying to do "wack ass single target tank and spank pulls sheep this sap that hunter trap bullshit". Saying this just exaggerates what people are saying. There's absolutely a time and right place for everything. Likewise there's also a better team comp to do that with and ones that aren't as worth it. If you end up taking about the same amount of time to kill the mobs while also wasting more mana from yourself, the party, and the healer...then it's not worth it. It's just fact that managing more targets for longer can be more difficult to micromanage. Doing occasional single target burning on small-medium mobs ends up going smoother than trying to force an aoe pull. 
---
The reason why people are bringing up this shit in the first place is because people aren't respecting the other roles, are jumping in too early which leads to overstepping threat and fucking with tank aggro.
---
I love playing with fresh faces.
---
The problem is when noobs act like their time is more important. I dont care if your bis drops from magistrate and its easier to get from front side. No one wants to waste time in a game all about being efficient with your time.
---
Just because you dont respect your time in the game doesnt mean I shouldnt respect mine.
---
I just dont understand why. WHY!?

Mats are the equivalent of gold. When you are needing them you are effectively making your party buy them for you. If they had won the mat, they could have sold it for the value.
---
If you are doing this, you are objectively a ninja and you are doing so for purely selfish reasons, which in turns means that *YOU* need to get over yourself. You're not the only one in the group when you run a dungeon. Items aren't just yours because you say so.
---
Adjust your wrong way of thinking or you're going to have a very bad time. I'm just telling you. Take it or leave it.
---
i haven't played wow for almost a decade lol

but your personal experience is the only truth and i'm just wrong, right, i must be lying, i didn't even play vanilla apparently, jesus fucking christ
---
Are the gains from that in my case simply the RTVs or is there enough loot that divided amongst 3 players, each person could make upwards of 50g per hour?
---
Hell, our 3 boss run takes us 14 minutes now. Arena, Anger and Gollum Lord. Rinse and Repeat. Emp runs are about that fast now too. Maybe a tad longer because of the lava jumping.
---
So 5 are useful?
---
Tank's role is to control the encounter. It's a tough job, and it's not always easy to see where it's fine to let things go uncontrolled!
---
I have seen tanks succumb to the "my group must obey me because they want me to lead" mental trap, but truth is, the biggest part of leadership is listening.
---
If someone else pulls, are they actually a dumpster fire or are you just moving too slow? Momentum feels amazing in group play, and if you're in command you've got to be conscious of it.
---
One of my favorite tiny efficiencies is to mark caster mobs as priority targets, and just not tank them. If your group has a Warrior or Rogue on DPS, they can usually do a fine job locking them down then deleting them while you focus on the mobs that can actually kill the party.
---
Spell cleave is another one. You just can't realistically hold threat, so once it's lost, as a tank you should be focusing on kiting and DPS while throwing out tactical taunts as needed.
---
Tanking is a hard job, but figuring out how to tank in a way that lets everyone in the group shine is even harder. To me it's always been the most worthwhile pursuit in the game.
---
So for a warrior using either a sword or a mace they need to get to 6% hit for sure? How would a warrior calculate if they have the 25% block chance needed to fill the gap? Also, I am guessing this means that warriors in end game raids need to keep shield block constantly on. This would mean shield block&gt;revenge&gt;sunder right?
---
I heal as 0/30/21 and have no problems raid healing and even beating out most healers. NS is very useful. The only real lost not going further down resto is the +10% healing. Swiftmend is great n all but a big mana sink. Most raids u'll just be spamming downrankd healing touch and maybe a rejuv/regrowth here n there mainly on tank. But unless ur the only druid healer in a raid its really not important
---
Needing on drops like gems or orbs is just bad manners.  These aren't uncommon and most professions will use them.
---
Needing on patterns/formulas is accepted and generally practiced in good faith.
---
They weren't excluding him because of his level.  They were saying that needing on universal desired drops is bad.  Doesn't matter if he is a 59, 60, or level 1.

&lt;Is A God&gt; NA PVP Whitemane Server Alliance. Casual but looking to raid.
---
Intro: &lt;Is A God&gt; at its core is made up of old friends. Most of the original members have known each other through multiple games, while many of us know each other since vanilla we have several first time players that we've brought with us from other games. We started out with a pretty full group of players but attrition along the way due to real life issues and wife aggro has thinned our numbers that we must now open recruitment fro some new friends. We run dungeons daily and are working to gear up leveling guildies as they approach 60 to help fill our raid slots. 
---
Raid Info: Currently just looking to do Friday 7 pm - 10 pm PST. We may adjust this or open up a second night but currently this is our plan. Currently using open roll but as we fill a higher percent of our slots with guildies we will be switching to closed bit DKP with slight decay.

One thing I do to try and help with AoE threat is use a macro to swap to 2h and WW on CD. If I have excess rage before the swap, I sink it with an extra sunder/demo shout, then swap to WW.
---
Immediately after the WW I just swap back to Def Stance with my sword and board. I basically have my 2h out for one GCD, so I don't take too much damage and I gen a decent amount of AoE threat.
---
Since WW only hits 4 targets, I try to sunder the remaining mobs with the highest HP since most times they are the ones who were not hit by the WW.
---
Not a surefire way to hold AoE threat but I find it helps a bit more than tab-sundering alone - I can typically hold agro on 6+ mobs with using taunt/mocking blow as needed for mobs that peel.
---
Sounds like a plan.
---
Not much will change. Unless you are 48+ you won't see much difference in PvP-Action in P2.
---
Same. I can only handle so much cringe.
---
I also can't
---
Dude it is because you generally don't need on mats. Everyone can use some mats.
---
LFM UD Strat - everything plus mount reserved
---
I think he’s saying if you’re playing this game or commenting on the sub, you have no place to say anyone else doing the same is any more or less “cringey” than you are.
---
As in, it doesn’t matter what *they* are doing differently then *you*, *we* are all a bunch of losers because we share the commonality of being wow classic players.
---
Could be wrong though.
---
*laughs in rogueish*
---
I got rank 7 being super casual with bgs.
---
It was but they didn't expect the game to be as big as it is, so they privately know they would rather not but the community thinks it wants it gone so here we are
---
Is there any way to have a macro that will use my mana ruby, and if that is on cooldown, to instead use my Robes of the Archmage mana-recovery?
---
Yeah the Ony attunement starts in LBRS
---
 BRD is for MC attunement
---
laughs in rogue\*
---
 but it sounds fucked up because i have no jaw
---
He should've had Vanish fail, popped Sprint, and ran out of the classroom. 
---
Would've been more realistic.
---
^^^/s
---
Gotta love people who are proud of their ignorance.
---
Sigh *unzips*
---
I lost count of the number of times i brick walled rogue/X or druid/X teams with a quick mounted rush, perception and charge.
---
And I'm not saying escape artist isn't amazing (it is) but I had tons of success 1v1 vs mages on my human warrior. Engineering, quick reactions and years of practice make it one of my best matchups (i used to duel mages almost exclusively).
---
Why? Because for all the good #nochanges has done it also means stuff like AV also gets #nochanges.
---
Blizzard is scared to touch stuff even if it means making it legit better
---
i mean that completely makes sense but a complete noob also might not know what an easily google-able question is compared to a questiok he actually needs to ask trade chat about. I think its not really worth getting worked up over but i can for sure see how people can have the mentality of "just google it"
---
That helm gives +1% crit if I'm not mistaken.
---
Anyway +hit% and +crit% are extremely valuable stats and generally need a lot of AP on an item to outweigh them. Since it already has a lot of strength it's probably not going to be replaced for a long time.
---
For Those that haven’t used one before... how long is the cd and can be cast while moving? And how long is the cast
---
alright. moonfury over gift of nature then lol
---
I used this to learn routes for tanking, good stuff: https://playvanilla.blogspot.com/p/maps.html
---
Seriously! Seeing him with such low health and not knowing if any mobs were targeting him gave me anxiety.
---
I haven't tried it, but it would be difficult getting enough intellect from gear before 60 because you need close to 6k mana per pull.
---
58. Trying to get to 60 before reset
---
They miss 'cause you haven't leveled your skill in them. You should level the skill very quickly if you just give it a shot again. Once your skill is sufficient with wands you'll hit almost every time again. The point of wanding instead of using Shadow Bolt is to conserve mana so that you don't have to stop and drink (or life tap) as often.
---
Exactly that.
---
Take any loot addon or classic wowhead as reference.
---
They all state that the epic set comes in ph2, while the blue set will be available in ph6 (naxx). 
---
Incase I missed a set feel free to correct me, but the link you gave states nothing like this.
---
First song?
---
because they have good stats?  often stats more prioritized for pvp like stam.
---
They removed stuff like Infernal to make the world safer, they are not going to remove something that makes it feel less safe.
---
no.
---
+ XX damage affects spells not weapon damage.
---
Can this benefit me for doing arena runs? I usually do 5 and then wait 30-40 minutes for lockout to be up.
---
Could you go into further detail?
---
I mean quests in the sense of in BG quests. "go kill X tower boss, come back and i'll give you some rep" type quests wont be worth it because no one will be doing them.
---
Or the "Go get me a ram, get 30 we can do ram riders" wont be a thing people do.
---
Dishonorable kills?
---
Do you have to have a mount to do ZF? How difficult is it without one?
---
Yeah, so nobody is doing the quests because they’re fun or even good quests, but because of the faction reward. 
---
Best part about vanilla AV was the EPIC battles that would take place at chokepoints. Then you get everyone to turn in their blood or w/e and have your alterac bosses duking it out
---
&gt; illegal
---
Carefull dude blizz is gonna knock your door down any minute now!
---
It was here!
---
Raging Berserker Helmet doesnt have %hit on it....
---
I personally wore it on my shaman at 60 for quite a while.  It's super well itemized and gives insane stats for a level 40 helm.  I really doubt you have a helm that basically equates to 21 Agi / 13 str / 8 stam.
---
Disagree. This is part of the game. It's why I chose a PVP server. 
---
If this were real life, not everything would be fair. I'm glad douchebags like this are around.
---
You can get a full set of blues from pvp around rank 9. Rank 10-14 you start accumulating epic quality pieces of gear at a rate of 2-3 pieces per rank with the later ranks including the heavier pieces like weapons.
---
my 40 palas biggest crit was 3700
---
i enjoyed the hours of bg ques as opposed to joining a WSG vs random people. many games i have played have always lost that community aspect when they start to do the server mixing in PVP aspects. if you ganked me in STV and i see u 10 levels later in WSG. im coming for you.
---
dont try and be witty. ur just a loser anyways
---
Hahahahahahha
---
Damn scalies are multiplying
---
 AuctionLite, Booty Bay Gazette and Aux are better supported.
---
If you feel like you are entitled to something for your time commitment, you need to find another game.  I'm not trying to belittle you but that is how the game is designed.  You could raid for weeks without getting a drop.  There is a huge need for gear and a very small supply of it.
---
Additionally, needing on materials because you don't have time is going to make your time pugging even harder.  Groups have a memory of who needs on materials excessively and you'll find your requests to join groups or the groups you create take forever to get started as a result.
---
Blizzards awful infrastructure and support never failing to disappoint... Second time this week.
---
Horde did on my old server, because it let them abuse the bug where you could pull vandar out of his bunker but you couldn't do so to drekk'thar so they got ez pz wins
---
Skeram Horde. 60 Fury warrior having trouble find a late night raiding guild, weekends or weekdays. After 11pm would be preferable. My schedule is also changing next month so after 10pm in December would work as well.  I am 8/10 in MC and 1/1 Ony. I just have not found the time to complete any PUGs because they are start 1 or 2 hours late every time.
---
The biggest gains are definitely the RTVs. There's also good stuff for an herbalist. You can make some gold trying to sell specific items to dps, but that's not super lucrative. If you need some incentives for your guildies outside of helping you get TF you can let them have all the blues to sell as well as give them everything out of the RTVs except the Arcane Crystals.
---
30 hrs in a week? no problem, even for a moderate player really
---
but 3-4 months? OUCH
---
Funny to see this in WC , just had a convo with a guildie about this today and him saying sham tank is viable end game, after I told him just cause it can tank WC doesn’t mean it’s viable as a tank
---
No and not difficult at all, if you don't wipe you won't mount at all.
---
I remember before Classic launched and GMs said there wouldn’t be skeletons. I’m glad they were receptive to the backlash on that one.
---
I mean really I'm just waiting for the game to get good again.
---
I'm guessing November 26th. People on Reddit are pretty clued in but there are a lot of people in the minority factions of pvp realms that have no idea what is coming. There will be howls of outrage and a lot of cancellations.
---
Sure if you don't want to tank please don't, that way we can skip these posts complaining about tanks and go back to posts complaining about the lack of tanks
---
JFC
---
Did you ever consider using your own brain ?
---
Yeah it definitely goes both ways. However until level 60 unless you really struggle with tps, unless you know how to arms tank and have a healer that can fight through heavy damage. You really have to work hard as a tank to compete with aoe dps, or players aggressively competing for top of the Meter. You know when this is happening because ranged is standing right next to you and ready to blast mid pull.
---
I can hold agro, that being said if you want to in every situation, with every group comp, you should expect to get tendinitis
---
wow wtf
---
It's actually mostly warriors, hunters, and mages.
---
Remember when everyone was crying about the skeletons before the game released?
---
Not as much as [Throne of the Tides](https://external-preview.redd.it/cXIKYlrLmJ_r_FuMCbGRGCFhD3teNzF-DqvctE0AyS8.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93a5041ac49f973202ae366216b66b2a95e32cb0).
---
Not OP but I think BOSanc is just a better skill in PVE than holy shock.  It's rare for a paladin to have it and is a great buff to have on tanks to decrease damage taken.
---
Why would you cc one mob when cleave is so good and on many different classes? Locks can dots, warriors can cleave and sweeping strikes, rogues can blade flurry and throw bleeds, hunters have multishot and serpent sting, etc etc.
---
It's inefficient to only have one mob taking damage.
---
I've just been buying heart of fire at vendor price or below from the AH and have been slowly stacking it up lol.  Lots of the stuff people just want to get rid of and blindly go with what their AH addon tells them to post it as.
---
same here.. again..
---
It's by no means required. You'll see it used a lot in Mage AOE runs, but outside of that I'd never say it's required.
---
So I should be wearing it?
---
Agreed. Tanking is like driving a car. Wont any youtube video help you do that, it takes experience and muscle memory. While OP has some valid points, it comes off as aggresive. OP should be the better man and talk with his tank about what might need to be done better. For a social game, many have poor social skills - and then blame the events that happen on an individual rather than plain communication. The best tank and the best dps could butt heads because neither know how to work with the other. It all takes communication. 
---
"Hey can you mark skull for main targets pls?"
---
That's not hard. But I guess make a PSA reddit about it is better, knowing the tanks he is probably talking about wont read it. Bothers me when people's first response to a unfortunate event is flame and blame and seek attention. Seems to be a trend. But I'm ranting on your comment mb.
---
It does, I made a guild with some friends and now we have full raid runs and are at least 10 people on discord every night leveling alts or doing dungeons. I wouldn’t enjoy wow alone even though it’s nice to just farm with some music on from time to time.
---
Pretty sure it's 50/50
---
Everyone is cookie-cuttering, but that doesn't mean you can't do a really solid job of showing them what they're missing.
---
Imagine having even one epic weapon
---
You can do it, and it's a decent way to make passive income while getting some XP out of it. If your server is gankfest central, it's a valid option. Probably not faster than good BRD/LBRS groups, but you're not really reliant on anyone else, either.
---
i'm also looking for a good auctioneer alternative. I hate the giant window of information when mousing over every item. I just want to know approximate market prices.
---
Don't forget Premeditation (+2 on cast) and Initiative (75% chance at +1 on openers) exist.
---
Un'Goro &gt; WPL &gt; EPL + 1 time doing dungeons and their respective quests should get you there no problem.
---
Other classes draw aggro as well, but they're generally more resilient.  Rogues for example can just push the evasion button and have higher armor/hp pools - mages have to kite and be aware enough at that moment where all the pats or other mobs are.  The skillcap on mage when issues occur is just higher due to smaller room for error, so there are more failures.  Everything else has self heals, significant mitigation, feign death, etc. that requires a single button push.
---
Im tanking raids. MTing raids.
---
Bears are phenomenal tanks at this phase of the game.
---
People are entitled about themselves.  They don't want to share their time with others.  They don't want to accept competition for gear.  They don't want to spend months gearing themselves up like it was in vanilla.
---
BiS lists should never have been created imo.  They are used daily like sledgehammers when the differences aren't that massive.  Sure I could take your BiS and then have my BiS drop next run.  I could also pass on your BiS and not see mine drop for a month.  Being entitled to gear without talking about it upfront is toxic.  My opinion is that gear should go to the person that benefits the most.  After that, a random roll is the best decider.  And no, BiS is not the most benefit.
---
I play on a pvp server and I am thinking about leveling from 50-60 mainly in dungeons. Is this even feasible? I can do Mara and ST now and at 52 I start looking for BRD groups trying to do first half. At 55 I can do some DM and then look for higher dungeons at 56/57? Is it worth considering respec to prot or wait until 60?
---
You gotta give it to him, he really committed. After the ambush he could have just sprinted away or made a B-line for the exit, instead he actually weaved his way back through the rows of seats.
---
Oh yeah I see the point for sure, but since my experience was underwhelming, I kind of forgot about it.  Thanks for the tip.
---
&gt; There is no aggro reset
---
You only need there's some shit about an aggro reset when people don't know how to manage their aggro. After two sunders you can basically start doing damage to it, assuming you know how aggro works and you don't OVER-aggro.
---
yep same here. I get to the Logging in to game server and then i get kicked.
---
I mean, they didn't alter their stance on that subject at all.  Skeletons were always going to be in.
---
Players wanted each death per person to leave additional skeletons and Blizzard said no and committed to that, which is out of vein on how Vanilla did function but I think it makes these forests of skeletons more impressive because each corpse is representative of a single personal death as opposed to maybe the same 10-15 people die a whole load of times.
---
I may be wrong here, but I believe there is a mace in DM that is like 95% as good as Warden, which severely hurts its price.
---
They can see you from farther away than normal but its nowhere near max clip range.
---
Yeah, Arugal which is heavily horde favoured and still layered so I’m not looking forward to these last few levels.
---
Going to give it a go when I hit 55 and see how I get on, cheers!
---
Peons rise up! 
---
Watch out who you try to take advantage of, or soon all of your misbegotten gains will be REDISTRIBUTED!
---
I've seen it sell on my server for upwards of 500g
---
Your trick isn't going to work on us.  Sorry bro but you're going to have to rank up by fighting people your level.
---
&gt;and how does that work when you pulled 4 mobs and taunt only works on one of them? Demoralizing roar doesn't generate enough threat...swipe only works if I have rage (which i don't because the DPS pulled)...challenging roar is a 10 minute cooldown. 
---
You specified a single target in the last comment, if we're talking about a DPS pulling multiple mobs in a group then in my post I'll refer you to "obvious exceptions"
---
Druid main tank, we is DPS.
---
same here
---
please explain hehe
---
&gt;Not every zone is a world PvP zone (this is true for Classic) nor does it have to be.
---
Every zone past lvl 30 is. Not to mention flying makes entire continents non-PvP zones.
---
&gt;Flying or no flying, you still have to ground yourself to complete your objectives.
---
Which greatly reduces your overall participation in the world. You literally just plop out of the 2nd dimension and just reappear where you want to without having to interact with anything. Like watching for mobs, other players or anything. One feature of what made WoW vanilla good is that you didn't get to pick how the world interacted with you. You didn't get to choose if you wanted to participate in the dangers of the world.
---
&gt;And there's nothing wrong with being able to fly away after you've been corpse-camped for 20 minutes.
---
There definitely is because your first choice will to be to fly away as soon as you are inconvenienced in the slightest. That's literally the state of retail PvP where people only drop down if they think they are going to win.
---
&gt;Your second point is invalid in the general case. There are non-open-world objectives, as well as no-fly zones.
---
Yeah, you get no immersion in those zones. What kind of argument is that? It's a complete non-sequitir. 
---
&gt;And no, I don't feel like it takes me away from the experience. It adds to it.
---
The vast majority of the playerbase disagrees. And that's fine that you like flying, but most people came to Classic for a specific experience, an experience that flying very much negatively impacts.
---
1. Keep your thorns up.
---
2. Ask for retribution aura.
---
3. Ask that your group gives you a couple seconds.
---
4. Pull with fairy fire or moonfire.
---
Now everyone can AOE to their heart’s content.  Druid is really good at tanking for an over eager mage with a pally.  Honestly you aren’t very gear dependant but should be focusing on stamina and agi gain mostly.  You have a lot less rage generation.  Don’t use challenging roar unless you really really need to.  It’s your one panic button.
---
But we knew TBC gear was going to out do classic gear back then to.
---
I HATED auctioneer. So much useless garbage. This is why I am using auctionator. Has vendor price, auction price, and disenchant price (doesn't work right)
---
Except all of the dungeons are easily campable. On my server BRM is already a warzone and getting into BRD is often an epic quest
---
Why would a 60 farm honor in a zone 20 levels below what would give them honor?
---
What else would you do on a flight when you're being straddled?!
---
Really just depends on ur server...iv seen anywhere from 250-500. Tho I will say with DM out theres a mace thats basicly the same, that druids like me who refuse to pay that stupid high price get instead
---
See the google doc (Dive's drain tanking guide):
---
 [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qdUs229\_XvkR1NCeTrJkybL5BDXGIh7q/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qdUs229_XvkR1NCeTrJkybL5BDXGIh7q/view)
---
its 10% but yea...
---
It's not easily avoidable now. How will it be easily avoidable when people are rewarded for it?
---
Get away from her, you bitch!
---
Btw, the queen alien was from aliens, the 2nd movie, not alien the 1st movie.
---
I took the staff and sold it for 3g thinking "I'll get something better by 60"
---
Now that DM is out, most will just go for the Mace there then pay crazy prices. I'd say a good number is 200.
---
It is good, but not good enough to really dip the price of Warden's since Druid tanks have to wait so long for anything actually better than the Staff to be added to the game.  It is still pulling near 300g on average on my server.
---
Can I not be excited for both?  Love PvP!!!!
---
Also, if you do any PVP being able to run away or catch others is a big advantage.
---
How do you setup your actionbars to get this to work? When you switch stance the action bar will change as well right?
---
With the slight difference that dungeon entrance weren't (as much) camped. Now it's going to be corpse hopping to get in. And that's not just 48-59, but 60 looking for pre-bis and even raider going into MC/ONY.
---
Restarts mean a lot in games with set content.
---
Fml
---
I can go farm anything for 5 minutes and as a resto shaman I'd still break 5g. Cry more about dropping 5g.
---
Lol not even close pal.
---
The Manual Crowd Pummeler is supposed to be **the** consumable for feral druid dps. Yes, *consumable* bc they have only three charges/uses.
---
Thank you :)
---
*"Your experiences are wrong."  --My n*ew favorite argument for everything.
---
And because you create so much threat, you also need to be more proactively managing aggro...that's your cross to bear, not mine for you.
---
Hunters...well, if they fuck up they can FD or get their pet to OT the add they pull.  Warlocks just die and that's not necessarily the tank's fault.
---
I had a long conversation this weekend with our guild's top ranked warlock, who is a fantastic person, but can't control her aggro.  In a DMN run she was the only DPS to pull off me and both the other DPS were topping her in the charts.  Thankfully she asked for advice on how to manage her threat more effectively and we talked about it.
---
I'm convinced there's just people who like inventing things to complain about, then a bunch of super casual people who will jump on every bandwagon because they feel perpetually behind because they only get to play for exactly 22 minutes a day.
---
She's destined to be Rexxar's pet.
---
I was offtanking for this surly, anal MT in a UBRS run. Had to be on discord, had to discuss every pull, yet mysteriously as we're on the ledge above Father Flame he's like "should we skip these three dragons?" "It's a pug, so no."
---
He got one shot by a much higher level mob than he was. He leveled up, got full health, them died in one hit. He wasn't dying to an even level mob.
---
Wow. Impressive. Did you kill others on your main and loot on your alt or?
---
great comment
---
They have seemingly nerfed Crystals from the veins out of jump runs. There was a noticeable shift in drop rate on my 70+ runs.
---
since 55 i just did dungeons and dungeon quests
---
Well, then give me an instance entry token satchel!
---
Odd opinion considering resilience was and still priased as the savor of PvP. TBC is classic, but better.
---
thank you!
---
This. When I played vanilla WoW I was like 8 years old so naturally, I don’t know shit about classic.  But every item/quest/dungeon that interests me I just look up on Wowhead so I can become informed and more efficient with my classic experience.
---
Quake is probably the better analogy. Strafe Jumping is a "bug" in the physics engine of the quake games. By Strafing in the air after jumping you can gain speed allowing you to travel faster. This is now a feature in all the quake games.
---
thank you, awesome info!
---
The point is he said ppl won't do the quests and I'm saying they willl, idk what you're going on about old man
---
You can tank as arms or fury NP. As a tank you might occasionally have to wait to find a healer, but you will generally be in demand for dungeons so it's pretty viable to spend most of your time in dungeons. You will miss out on some reputation by not doing many quests.
---
You can tank as 2H arms until ZF or higher. Principally in defensive stance but stance-dancing as necessary.
---
Or you can take the hidden path that goes around the north end of camp, no guards.
---
Nope, they stay until you use them.
---
Red Dead 2 on PC came out just in time, I can skip Phase 2 altogether on my only character, lvl 29 Priest - Cancel my sub and go play that for a few months, STV is gonna be impossible to get anything done.
---
&gt;People probably weren't paying 100% attention to have all 60s and struggle with an LBRS boss.
---
We steamrolled everything else, including 4 manning Wyrm when the warlock dropped.
---
But I will say the second mage was slow on the polymorphs, so I suspect that is part of what went wrong...i think he was high?  Honestly, he died early on in the Wyrm fight and we managed to 3 man the rest, so maybe he was the weak link.
---
Sure it is. Thing that is pissing me off is the ever growing attitude of having to need to broadcast every single small feat accomplished and that its getting tiresome. Like the bar is set way too low. Seems like people are increasingly unhappy with the achievement alone and seek validation for everything. 
---
Begging for contragtulatory feedback for stuff like completing high school or getting a drivers license. Do we really have to jump on the gz train for these things? Well social media sure is. Win a competition or achieve something that the majority is unable to, I feel thats more worth social gratification rather than mostly inevitable milestones.
---
Tbh this post is actually in my mind more geared towards Warriors, haven't had a single bad bear.
---
Classic dies off when Shadowlands comes out.
---
I paid 16s bro.  Big resto boi look at you chain healing for hours and hours and hours must be fun
---
Not a ninja loot but it is nice when 1 person says "roll for chest" in chat just to avoid these situations.
---
We once added /gquit into a friend's combat rez macro, he found out halfway through a Ragnaros fight.
---
Guys if you think this is cringe you are dead wrong. No one walks into a classroom crouched like that thinking it'll actually work xD That kid is a legend of comedy.
---
How much ? :D
---
DK's were a good idea but implemented in a fucking terrible way that basically ruins city pvp for rankers, but does absolutely nothing to prevent griefing.
---
Or if your group leader's a ret pally who thinks it's charitable to bring underleveled guildies in a group with no aoe through the lyceum.
---
Tanking is responsibility. Fury warrior chart chasers are allergic to it.
---
I have been playing on and off since late vanilla, but I am casual. I never went too in depth into the numbers game until recently and definitely don't know everything about the mechanics of every class. 
---
The smoothest groups I have had are all made up of more casual laid back mindsets, not people who want to gogogogogo and think we need to do super perfect meta nonsense.
---
I have had tanks in best in slot gear die because they dont comprehend their healer cant heal them while drinking at 8% mana out of LOS. "Youre the problem. Improve your healing" 
---
Blizzard really was hoping that classic would die off fast, and we as a community are the only ones that can make sure that doesn't happen. Sadly, it's going to go that way if we keep treating each other this way. I have seen so many people already drop it for other games just because "This isnt the wow they remember" due to the private server elitest community having too strong a hold.
---
Really? I just have my alt reset the instance and it puts me back at the water fall.
---
You use your normal rez's while waiting.  Or is it a 30s charge up?  I've only had engineering on my pally and shammy so never grabbed jumper cables.
---
All three things currently exist on some servers. I average 4-6 corpse runs to get to BRD. I've only done DM:E once and it was in off hours and saw nobody on the path to DM so only 2 corpse runs after getting near the instances.
---
When I say let tank pick up boss I mean stop dps. This is literally how my guild does it. I said stop dps and let tank pick up boss. This is how it works.
---
He was healing.  But please, tell me more about how I’m wrong and he didn’t contribute.
---
Its just anybody out of college these days lol
---
Right.  Because blue gear is perm BIS for all classes.  Or that all people are going for preraid BIS when that priest could be trying to put together a grinding/questing set or a pvp outfit.  Can I claim priority on pvp BIS?  Or grinding BIS?  Or do I have to watch all the gear that will help me get to 60 go to the mages and warlocks?
---
I don't really care whether something is pre raid BIS for someone or not.  If it isn't purple or if it would not be replaced in the current tier of raiding, it literally doesn't matter.  After all, you could raid tonight and replace that pre BIS item you 'claimed' whereas the hunter could be weeks away from seeing his BIS item.
---
The only thing that is fair is randomness.  If it is an upgrade to your current gear, roll need.
---
The difference is INCREDIBLY minimal. 
---
Wardens will be slightly better when agi enchants are available but the Maul is currently superior because you can put the 3% Attack Speed BS attachment on it.
---
I actually prefer the 1h Fromm Dire Maul with the OH from strat live. 120 armor, 18 stam, 13 str and 8. Impervious Giant Fromm BrD is great too for threat.
---
they just don't it exists.
---
Pretty sure he doesn't even know what "figures" in income means, and just picked what he thought was a low number as an insult.
---
Either that, or he counted the , as a figure, and meant $10,000 as 6 figures.
---
ah fair, i hadn't actually looked into the stats as i've just got a low level lock. that makes sense
---
I think I converted OP so -1 now.
---
It's covered by the comment immediately below, which was posted to the thread before mine. No need to be redundant.
---
Yeah, I have been in 2H but now I am using sword and shield. I purchased my first purple, wall of the dead, love it. Trying to decide whether to keep using Thrash blade or use The Hand of Antu'sul which I picked up in my most last ZF run.
---
There are some horde friendly undead in ashenvale that I'm pretty sure are just part of an alliance quest.
---
Sweeping Strikes + Whirl Wind Then swap to shield is amazing, Highly recommend it.
---
That makes absolutely no sense. If the imaginary 60s that would show up to defend lowbies wanted to PvP, they'd already be PvPing in a hotspot. Also, why would I setup this elaborate trap to summon 60s by killing lowbies when I could just go to a high level zone or hotspot and just kill 60s and cut out the wasted time.
---
You should consider farming the rivenspike axe from the rare spawn in LBRS, and bone slicing hatchet from strat dead. It’s pretty close in dps.
---
I bought the two epic BOEs myself, and I wish I still had that 500+ gold to go towards lionheart
---
Nah PVE server only for now
---
/r/ComedyCemetery
---
So I'm not crazy, thanks. I must have missed that.
---
I am raiding so it's raid fury. I leveled 31/5/15 giving me last stand and 1 pt imp shield block  and 3/5 defiance. I find generally the ss ww route described is too slow and dps has already pulled off me. And generally ww and ss end up hitting the same target resulting in a few targets with no threat going to the healer resulting in Benny hill pulls. I just sword and board sunder the elites and let dps burn whatever taunting what I need to off heals
---
Yes, Blizzard restores valuable quest items (sometimes).
---
Yes, you can restore your own deleted items (on a limited timer).
---
Also, you can just go back to Winterspring and get a new one from Haleh.
---
I sit 6 to 8 hours a day and im still not 60 😢
---
Oh so this guy is going to exploit regular players with gear he has no business having? Stuff like this is why I stopped playing this game in high school and it’s probably going to make me quit again.
---
Fire Whelps
---
I spent levels here at launch just grinding and got about 8 or 9 of the pets among other BoEs.
---
It's a real problem though, they rushed the DM release, and they rushed Phase 2. At this rate Phase 5 will be out by March, and there's not going to be any point in even having the phases.
---
I mean, don't jump into strat at lvl 50, or spend hours looking for group. But if you see people looking for a dungeon that is not too high for you, then ask for an invite.
---
Berseker’s Helm is most likely better.
---
Most of his gear was cloth tho.
---
RIP my plans of continuing to raid tonight...
---
I don’t remember AoE being a thing in Vanilla.
---
I don’t remember “BiS” or similar being a thing in Vanilla.
---
Nor do I remember “xx reserved” or everyone running around with the EXACT SAME optimal quest/dungeon loot.
---
I also expected more maturity from the other players, seeing as most are in their 30s and 40s. Yet on my server LFG reads like 4chan.
---
I wouldn't respec because of Phase 2 - but you might think about doing the respec just because you are level 53 and probably about to spend a ton of time in BRD, LBRS, UBRS, Scholo, Strat and then on to raiding.
---
The SM/Ruin or DM/Ruin specs are the two most used end-game specs so it makes the most sense to just get ready for the dungeon running that is coming.  I respec'ed to SM/Ruin at around Level 56 or 57 and am having no issues questing with it.  I am not the most die-hard PVP'er but it seems to do okay for me in PVP so far also.
---
The only thing that might change that is if you are just planning on fully PVP'ing and not worried about instances.
---
I understand what you are saying. However, that isn't what the OP said. The OP said people are rude to him for asking basic questions. If he is asking the questions I would assume he knows what to ask. Therefore, he can look it up too.
---
I honestly don't hate grinding. In vanilla all I did was grind. I didn't do a single quest after level 10. Just killed stuff because 14 yo me that it was the coolest shit ever. That was without having the ability to watch TV/netflix at the same time too.
---
Must say though, if you get ganked solo, fight it out. At level 54 I got ganked by a 60 Druid. I absolutely fucked him up and killed him. He had the jump on me and everything. I don't think he was anticipating a lower level player to actually try. Granted, I'm a warlock, so as far as world PVP goes I know I'm a durable nightmare. But still. Mind control. Fear. Use your pets. Do whatever you can to make the asshole pay.
---
Another "dont mind anyone just move at your own pace" post.
---
Yea, I just don't like this all dps are braindead stance every tank here seems to have when their play could very well be the problem.
---
Those zones are a bit lower trafficked I guess?
---
Safespotting is bannable.
---
They were not hitting me, and I removed all of the buffs to test it.
---
I hate being a warrior sometimes. I wiped on this when I did it at 58. The ability to solo stuff is so not a warrior thing
---
Not at all required.
---
So is this gear good enough to keep us relevant if we are struggling to get into raids? Like, could you gear out a Spriest solely on PVP gear if all you're doing is PVP?
---
The MH is 2.9 and the OH is 1.7 in this case. If you already have epic mount and lionheart for sure not a problem buying the BOEs. I just wish I had known this combo was as effective before I spent the money so figured I’d share
---
To clarify, I don't have any issues with reserve runs.  Hell, I prefer them.  I take umbrage with the rogues or warriors who assume everything BiS is reserved all the time, without saying anything about it.  It's one thing to join a group and expect a shot at loot opposed to knowing that you won't have the opportunity to roll for it.  I would prefer more reserve runs so people would stop bringing up BiS lists as reasons why someone shouldn't roll an hour into the run.
---
Yes?
---
I did say it's all about context. 
---
If someone comes into MC expecting to learn from scratch with 39 other people who prepared, is it wrong for those 39 to be upset?
---
Yeah I made the incorrect assumption that everyone was rolling need on mats they needed. My argument is invalid.
---
Daily thread now.
---
30 seconds of equip cooldown. All trinkets and on-use items have cooldowns before they can be activated if you equip them from not wearing them.
---
ATTENTION I AM A WOMAN AND NEED TO DRAW ATTENTION TO IT IN AN UNRELATED SITUATION
---
Hahaha
---
Unless your friendly 60s are too busy ganking the other faction 48s...
---
Because shadow priest pvp set is decent as hell compared to the current raid gear thats out around this phase.
---
Originally you never got this gear until much later.
---
With all that stam on the R10 gear you'll be MELTING.
---
Glad I'm a tailor and can stack runecloth more efficiently!
---
Seriously, Apple and Google really started and pushed the whole 'ecosystem' trend. User customization has gone by the wayside.
---
You're talking about the savage gladiator?  Do i want it all or just the chest?
---
Make sense to get XP while farming.  I'll start jumping in those.  They're always looking for tanks.
---
On my server, most of the time it's around 350g. At one point the price dipped to about 250 or so. During the dip, some guy sold it to me for 160g and a pair of Living Shoulders, because he figured the price was plummeting even further. Price actually went back up to normal, so I'm quite happy with that trade.
---
Is Rank 14 remotely possible while holding a 40+ hour/week job?
---
Stop calling me
---
yup it's a noob ass echo chamber in here, flower sniffers competing on who's the most casual and patient, warriors that are too lazy to use their taunt button and let dps that pulled aggro die to "teach them a lesson" -_-
---
Searing Gorge is just particularly bad because it's right beside BRM.  So any 60 travelling to a dungeon in BRM, or bored waiting for their group are in SG.
---
This subreddit is turning into an emotional support group for more casual players. 
---
"Just ignore the big bad content creator, sweety. It's okay, this reddit post will make you feel better."
---
I would like to see a shaman at 60 have a go in some naxx gear and other high level gear. Im sure i know the answer but would be fun trying to heal them.
---
Mages are great. However, you will spend a significant amount of your 0-60 time staring at an animation of someone drinking water. It's a bit of  a downside. Almost every class has some serious space to shine, and Mage does have an easy time melting faces while leveling, and genuinely does have the best AOE tools overall. 
---
But every class has something like that. Warrior, that grind will suck, but at 60....everything gets better. Stealth classes are frigging glorious for shenanigans. Pally, uh. Priests have mind control and are amazing at 1v1 pvp. Everyone has something.
---
That’s ridiculous. 
---
Nobody is wasting anyone’s time by asking a question in general chat. If anything you are wasting your own time by replying with a ‘Google it’ response.
---
Like 55g. 
---
I like recipes. *A lot*.
---
&gt;No. Extra attacks of any kind cannot proc other extra attacks.
---
Source on that? 
---
As a sword spec rogue with thrashblade main hand and dagger offhand, I often see auto-attack, sword spec, then a fraction of a second later, thrash blade procs and my swing timer resets. It makes it look like auto attack procd sword spec, which procd thrash.
---
Looking forward to seeing some more on my way up to 60.
---
Ewww, girls are yucky!
---
Bruh, I’m lvl 37
---
It’s these cancerous wow veterans that are put aids
---
No one needs your advice everything about the game is online.
---
Old archaic shit isn’t helpful and there are new better ways to play the game.
---
The tanks that take forever to go one by one are fucking aids
---
&gt;  starcraft level apm 
---
I cannot play Starcraft at a level anywhere above the lowest tier of ladder. However, when I was tanking WC yesterday, and the group was pushing me to go fast (and to their credit, were all better than I was, we didn't die at all), I sure felt like I had "starcraft level apm"! lol that's a great visual, thanks!
---
add these players to ignore, put them on your guild's blacklist, and even mention it on your server's discord if you think it warrants it. It's one thing to say "sorry, we don't want a mage" or something about your level - it's another to think the content is impossible to effectively do if you don't have all your pre-bis. These players are numbskulls.
---
Go back to retail
---
Whatever text they typed into trade chat, they could have typed into Google. 95% of the time, it would probably give them their answer.
---
No the only one I remember, was a gnome mage taunting a full mob of hordies... 
---
Fleeing down what appeared like a gentle slope, but was in fact a nasty fall...
---
Feather falling, and hordies falling all around just to be arcane aoe'd as a finisher...
---
Such a good laugh
---
Lol perfect anaology
---
The blacksmith requirement I'm pretty sure also holds true for Classic. But if you're a warrior or paladins odds are pretty good you have blacksmithing anyways.
---
Never played the game before so I guess I'm mistaken, I'll see when I get there.  What kind of quests are you doing at 60?
---
It sure isn't excusable. I'm a mage. First time WoWer. I had no idea what to build, what to roll on, what spec to go for. All I know is I was pissing people off each group. So I began to sincerely ask questions and look up some guides. Its made my life easier, as I'm no longer hated in pugs.
---
Oh I'm totally grateful, thanks for the heads up. In fact that fight club spreadsheet is showing that rivenspike with flurry axe is almost exactly equal... which is nice since flurry axe is the cheap one.
---
Oh my gosh.  The amount of rune cloth I got out of my BRD runs is staggering.
---
no, that's for rank10. For rank14 on a full realm you will be playing up to 12-14h a day of pvp for 3-4months.
---
Yes savage gladiator chest. It can take hundreds of arena runs to get but it’s bis for a very long time for dps Warriors.
---
use battle shout, they nerfed it when tbc came, remember this is old battle shout
---
You’re a liar 🤥 and you know it. Everyone here knows what first patch meant and if you say it meant p2 you’re arguing from a place of dishonesty and there’s no point ever talking with you about anything because you will lie over such a stupid and meaningless argument. Blocked.
---
In STV, had to kill the Elite Giant near the Bloodsail Buccaneers for the Captains Chest Quest i think. Solo hunter, so i clear the nearby beach area of pirates so i can kite him around. I start killing the mob and after a while of running around shooting at it, a group of 3 horde appear, i naively think they would help me finish him off (had around 10% health left), instead, they murder me and wait for the mob to reset so they can kill it.
---
I rez and proceed to target their underleveled healer for the next 45 minutes whenever they try to kill the mob, out of spite. I successfully make them wipe several times until they give up and leave without finishing their quest. 
---
Then i finish the quest in peace.
---
[Item restoration](https://eu.battle.net/support/en/restoration). You can get the items you vendored/disenchanted/destroyed back.
---
Find quests/mobs that are green to you. Try to finish as many as you can in one area of a map when they're clustered together until moving to the next. Turn everything in at once when finished, or when moving to the other end of the map and passing near the quest hub.
---
Mostly attunement quests and other dungeons quests for certain items and reputation.
---
I’m a lv 37 warrior. Not looking good for me rn
---
Devilsaurs as long as I am given a spot by the mafia.
---
You should tank better instead of being a shit tank that blames dogs when he can’t dynamically agro and keep up
---
You’ve got time to get to a level range where you can finish your grind to 60 inside the confines of BRM.  Don’t fret.
---
Your dumb ass would get kicked.
---
Well, PVP gear doesn't cover all slots so no, you will still need gear from dungeons/raids for some slots, but for the slots that you can cover, this gear is good.
---
Got these, and both Dal Rends in one day. Rng is rng, I guess.
---
*cries in priest* I feel you.
---
Whats the addon?
---
I mean sure it gets developed a little more. But I don't think you get more muscles than that if you keep your weight the same/average right?
---
Blizzard previously liked to pretend that the market for classic was so small that it would not be economically viable to offer it.  Private servers forced them to concede that there were at least hundreds of thousands of people wanting to play the game and that they were doing themselves a fiduciary disservice and risked losing control of their IP if they did not offer classic.  Make no mistake,  pservers definitely forced blizzard's hand here.
---
It's the fastest way if you want to do things 100% solo.  If you don't have a second account you can't make a group with your alt without help.
---
As a healer, its more work to heal when there is a dps warrior. They take agro all the time, and can't take a hit as well as the tank, and so I effectively have almost double the work. It's not just like throwing a heal or two when they take damage from being near the mobs, like for rogues, they're life goes down at least as fast as the tank's.
---
Bit you fucking Sunderland revenge and that’s it gg
---
Barrens chat?
---
I would love to dungeon farm, but I never know if I'm going to have enough time to finish a dungeon before logging.  Sometimes I have 3 hours sometimes, sometimes I got 37 minutes.
---
I ran a WC last night for example, the tank would not pull more than 1 mob at a time and I wound up pulling threat on every single one (was healing and white dmg dpsing) eventually we asked the tank to go heals so I could switch to my shield and shaman tank. The run would have taken about 3h at the rate we were going, I got us down to close to an hour. 
---
I get my post is a bit confusing with the duality of me speaking to my DPS at 60 and using my lvl 43 shaman as an example too.
---
They’re just outwardly expressing their loot frustration on low level players :)
---
https://www.icy-veins.com/
---
You would need to be very very very good friends with 10-15 other people who are very very very good at pvp. And then still play 60 hours/week minimum for 8+ weeks. Most people play 80+ hrs/week on the rank 13-14 push
---
If you and those other 10-15 players can win 95% of your BGs, then you can take the #1 honor spot with less time investment than the rest of the people in your server/faction.
---
*need Tank then gtg*
---
It also depends on when the OP is asking.  If it's in the middle of a run, it could take more time to google it, especially if you are unfamiliar with the verbage.  25 words to explain weapon skill or the BiS for various classes just saves time for everyone.
---
@Mods can we please auto filter posts like these?
---
Tasty +15 Fire Resistance.
---
If you wanna go to Blackrock Mountain from Kalimdor it's better to take the zeppelin from Orgrimmar to Grom'gol rather than Undercity. Taking the boat at Ratchet to Booty Bay is also an option depending on where you are.
---
Been sitting at 50 for almost 3 weeks because I'm tired of all the min-max players making groups annoying. That and other games coming out, but still. :P
---
Just report his twitch account. That’s what imma do.
---
For PVP I'd say barrage girdle as you can get 3%+ sp hit from the resto talent. PVE definitely the Sash.
---
This is the critical difference. Even in pug groups I find lots of people talk in party chat.
---
The group finder and streamlined dungeons in retail just turned dungeons into speed runs where no one interacts with each other.
---
The real gold is finding a good guild. Everyone chats in gchat all day and jump into discord for raids and dungeons. With the social aspect it’s a completely different game
---
&gt; I am pretty sure you cannot write IF THEN type of statements in macros
---
You could, but in some specific situations like IF defense stance THEN, or IF in_combat THEN.   
---
Unfortunately OP situation doesn't fall into this option)
---
Yea and since your workload has doubled, you’re generating twice as much threat. I understand people not having full understanding of all the mechanics (I definitely don’t understand everything) but when I try to explain exactly what we are talking about now, without fail, one or two people in the group will agree but then everyone plays like we didn’t just talk about it right after the convo.
---
And people think the cleverest insult in the world is Retail players around here, feel like I've been called that about 500 times now and I haven't played retail since early Cata
---
... have you ever played a Druid? And you’re implying they’re not fun to play? 🤔
---
&gt; When phase 2 launches and the honor system is in place, will the rewards be purchasable then?
---
I believe this is the case.
---
&gt;Also how do you acquire the rewards? Purchase with gold when you achieve the appropriate rank or is there an honor point type currency?
---
You purchase them for gold when you have the appropriate level, they are quite cheap if memory serves.
---
At 60 you aren't done running from or chasing people and having an epic mount decides if they catch you or not
---
Not a lot of upgrades for fury in current raid content.
---
True but also remember that most tanks are also during that journey learning, under geared and miss, they need time to build threat even more at low levels.
---
Okay even if they come in force then you get pvp and honor.
---
I’m completely geared and waiting for honour dude. He just asked why he should be worried about phase 2 starting with him being level 40.
---
Using tmorph? Got a link you can dm me? Thx
---
Nature's wrath does provide damage but zero mana and hp which is just not strong enough usually.
---
Cloth vs mail. Mail helps, but it's not always neccesary, it's hard to give the exact value for using mail, but something like 100 armor = 1stam ? may be accurate.
---
3% spell hit
---
Tier is great for pvp but you don't have to use it. 
---
about 12 sp = 1 crit.
---
Your post history has a lot of toxicity friend.
---
Eeic Chang officially needs to see a therapist or something.
---
Be good, man.  Take care of yourself.
---
Gotta lure people out of stormwind somehow. This is exactly how it works.
---
That's exactly what i'm scared of everytime !! :P
---
Well, it depends on what you want from your experience, doesn't it?
---
I'll always value playing with friends / cool people over beating content quickly. It's like the difference between playing soccer with your friends as an activity to do with them vs playing competitive soccer in college. Completely different priority sets.
---
Our guild hasn't finished Rag yet (lacking essences) but that doesn't bother me at all, I'm just happy I get to do fun things with people and being in a raid at all is super awesome for me. But it sounds like you're really big on loot and progression so perhaps you should look for a guild that has that.
---
You like to piss people off more than I do tho snow lol
---
Nah, they should make BGs cross realm only with servers of the same type.  Then all the alliance that got hellcamped leveling up get to do 5:1 matches in actual rewarding PvP situations.
---
So you guys are the reason I couldn’t hand in my UBRS quest :(
---
i don't have that much time to play so i'm only lvl 43 warrior and i'm doing the best I can to get to 60 before phase 2 comes out.  Once people start farming honor i'm going to dread lvling. ugh.
---
Winterspring Hederine Slayers
---
Eye of Shadows, Felcloth, good silver/cloth/green drops, and tons of RTV's scattered around.
---
I’m still level 39... it’s my first time playing wow and I’m taking it slow because it’s so much fun! But I’m pretty worried... my server is heavily overpopulated on the horde side and I’m a minority alliance... I don’t know if I’ll be forced to switch servers once P2 is released
---
It's not against this subreddits TOS or twitches TOS to post my stream link when im live... lol. It's why i haven't been banned from here.. Hata's gonna hate doe. If they change the TOS I will respect their new rules.
---
Do I lose honor if I don't play? Or is it just a lot of honor to rank up so people say its hours a day for months?
---
Where's the TLDR?
---
Anyways it's classic and doesn't matter :-)
---
I keep reading about enhancement shamans going healer for MC every week. Just play what you want and have fun.
---
One of our tanks is a druid and he's an absolute gem as well.
---
He got a full tier set of healing gear because he's the only in the raid tho :(
---
You mean in pvp?  I'm on a PVE server.
---
I am curious now, what's your ign class and race?
---
iMorph
---
10/10
---
Thanks for the chuckle. 
---
The thought of his classmates attacking him for no fucking reason is kind of hilarious.
---
Of course it's very difficult to get, I'm just saying that there is clear advantage to getting it. For example the rank14 swords/axes are basically on pair with AQ axe/swords, and by having gotten them "for free" you can use your DKP or loot council on getting other items. 
---
Typically rank10 gear is on pair with t1-t2 for pvp, and rank10 2piece is BiS for pve for most classes, so you get both pve and pvp advantages from ranking.
---
knock it off you're rly getting in your own way
---
PVP servers tend to lean heavily Horde, RP servers tend to lean heavily Alliance.
---
RPPVP servers are perfectly balanced, as all things should be (or at least closer than most servers get)
---
That’s why you don’t have a gf
---
3 raid lockouts is a long wait?
---
Yikes
---
Well on behalf of every Hordes players thank you :)
---
That's a very good point. For the most part grinding to 60 is doable and less stressful, as long as one doesnt mind the quest grinds. But when endgame bis farming and raiding became a chore instead of fun (which it shouldnt be that way but can seem that way sometimes) people start to look outward. Then they wanted the fastest runs possible, or certain group comps, or even reserving. Everyone had a right to play how they want and form groups how they want, just be civil about it. I'm not trying to paint the community in toxic colors, as that's not the case. Its just pretty abstract and I think many of us random people all in the same place just dont see eye to eye sometimes. I'm ranting again sorry. But ya, having knowledge goes a long way in this game, for every class. Knowing your CDs,  rotations, pathing, boss encounters, etc. Tanks imo need to know the most and some are humble enough to want to learn with their group in the first run.
---
The price for warden staff has always been relatively low for a BiS. Druids make up a very small portion of the population and probably half or less are invested enough into feral tanks to buy a warden staff. So the demand for warden staff is much lower than Edgemasters or that one Frost mage ring.
---
Hi guys got a question is there a macro for distracting shot so i can click the party member whic hgets attacked and would use distracting shot on the mob which is attacking the party member ( mouseover would even be better)
---
\+1 for change
---
I dont even remember.  But he died and goes "healer sux, i'm out" and then left the group.  That was his 4th or 5th time using his racial and the healer had told him NUMEROUS times to stop.  
---
I was shocked someone was quite so obtuse.
---
Paladin T1 is trash for healing in pve, which is why we wear cloth and leather items.
---
Yeah, you can use T1 in pvp, but requires you to raid MC. Another appeal of pvp gear is that it can be acquired from pvp alone; no raiding required.
---
I think that's the biggest problem you hinted on. People just kinda suck at communicating and being patient with helping someone learn. People expect everyone to already be masters.
---
Neither is BoSanc. You’ll most likely run with BoW so take Holy Shock to give you another way to snap aggro to you.
---
In vanilla I tried to play a druid. I got to level 11 and I wanted to kill myself and quit.
---
Well...you know.... i doubled spec haha... right ?
---
Eh, scamming someone on trade is one thing.  Anyone who thinks they should report someone over this need to grow a spine. 
---
Getting betrayed is story line 101 for fantasy books. Why play an rpg if you want to cry to mamma for something like that happening?
---
Bad time to be a fresh 60, too.
---
Either you already have raid gear and a group to PvP with at all times, or you're a target.
---
I’m dressing phase 2 I’m only level 38 no way I’m getting to 60 before then. Every man and his dog is going to gank me
---
This is great, stop being a little bitch about people pvping on a pvp server.
---
I'm intrigued, what was the interaction which triggered this post being written? I'm yet to see a beginner being abused like how you're implying.
---
Can't really be upset here. Don't get me wrong. These guys are being a little extra... but things like this have happened before. Guilds and other groups have player names and more scribbled down. Waiting and watching for em always. Kill or be killed on pvp servers. Life ain't fair.
---
&gt; Anyway +hit% and +crit% are extremely valuable stats 
---
+hit is viable only if you are fighting mobs with level higher than you.  
---
Like all level 63 raid bosses.  
---
During leveling 1-59 other stats, like +str/attack are more valuable.
---
its like druid is made for these emergencies haha x) Thanks to all druids
---
Great explanation!
---
About tree fiddy.
---
L2READ
---
&gt; However, it's best to ask in group chat when a BoE drops so you all agree what to do.
---
The group loot rules for BoPs, Whites and grays are already established and are of no contention. 
---
What is in contention is BoEs. 
---
&gt; Furthermore quest rewards should all be vendored no matter what so we can evenly split up the gold from vendoring them.
---
Seriously? You're an idiot. 
---
Just to be clear:
---
grays =/= whites =/= greens =/= blues =/= epics
---
bops =/= boes
---
if, in your head, they are the same and one rule fits all is the only thing you can understand. Well, maybe go back to primary school.
---
So you hope they decide to cater to casuals? Since when do casual players ever know what's good for a game?

---
Shame bootybaygazette is charging now though for the site.
---
I wish everyone could be like him... &lt;3
---
Good thing I'm on a PvE server lol
---
you know what my favorite thing to do in Classic of late is . to run both clients at the same time (not sure if you can on the same wow account..but currently using a starter account linked to my [battle.net](https://battle.net) for live just for testing.... run both clients and alt tab between them to see the changes :-p.    i like the visuals of how wow is now......butttt i am enjoying classic more then i thought i would kinda fun to go back to the "old world" and see how things used to be and compare and contrast. a LOT of stuff players take for granted now in the main game just wasnt there in classic 
---
im impressed they managed to do both!
---
just look up the 1.8 speed daggers that you can equip
---
Gratz
---
That's your opinion, its so far my favorite class that I literally have 2 of them. One at 60 and one about to hit 52. Don't ask why.
---
Shoulda gone bear
---
Yeah we barely read them though x)
---
It's too complicated for me too, but more importantly it is *hideous*.
---
That's an exception rather than the rule. 
---
Doing jail break and all the optional bosses adds an extra 30-45 mins at most.
---
A &lt;54 group is not level appropriate. They will have over 50% miss chance/glancing blow against Emperor.
---
How many do you figure you killed to get a pet?  Really tempted to put my level 27 rogue out there and just farm whelps when I'm feeling bored of my main.
---
Hearthglen and Tyr's Hand are nice as a rogue until I piss off a group of Alliance frost mages by stealing their Thorium nodes
---
Why do you think that people would want to watch this
---
If your horde
---
Making a single BiS list for PvE gear was already questionable, and for PvP it's just not a thing. You can easily have 20+ situational pieces of gear to carry around for PvP (a lot will be trinkets, but still). 
---
For a general running around set, I'd say the general stat priority is stam/HP &gt; hit (up to 3%) &gt; spellpower  &gt;&gt; int/crit (unless destro then crit is probably higher).
---
But the relative weights? If you asked 5 people you'd get 8 answers. For example, are Robes of the Royal Crown (12 INT/19 STAM/ 18 DMG) better than Necropile Robes (12 INT/22 STAM/ 8 DMG). I would say RRC is clearly superior, but I bet someone might disagree with me.
---
Are there problems with login servers tonight again??
---
Getting stuck on "Logging in to game server" followed by a disconnect. Anyone else?
---
EU, if that matters.
---
I was wondering about this too lol, I usually always pop a Major mana pot early in the fight. Something must have made me forget.
---
Yes for pvp, but in battlegrounds on a pve server
---
Gotcha.  
---
I'd probably just have it in the trinket slot as a part of my heal set from the getgo.  Then swap to normal trinket after, since it has a 30m CD or something, right?
---
It might not be against the TOS but do you really think people are going to want to follow your stream when you just spam post the link? And even if they do, it’s probably just going to be to troll you or leave nasty comments in Twitch chat... don’t know if that’s really worth it.
---
I just tried to figure this out cause I thought it'd be useful to have, and reading wow forums indicates that unfortunately macros can't check for cooldowns. So I think there are only 2 options:
---
&gt;/use Mana Ruby  
---
&gt;/use Robe of the Archmage
---
This would use both the first time, but then if you click it while ruby is up and robe is on cd then it'd just use the ruby.
---
The other option is setting up a modifier, like this:
---
&gt; /cast \[mod:shift\] Robe of the Archmage  
---
/cast \[mod:ctrl\] Mana Ruby
---
Of course you can switch the mod binds to whatever you'd like, but that would make it so clicking while holding shift would cast archmage, and control would cast mana ruby. If you got rid of the mod on one of them it'd make it so clicking would cast one and pressing the mod while clicking would cast the other. The only problem with the macro is that it wouldn't show the cooldown timers so that may be tricky to keep track of unless you created some sort of weakaura or used another mod to set up timer bars for that elsewhere on your screen.
---
I also hate these types of posts at the risk of being massively downvoted.
---
Is it OP being genuine, or is OP just fishing for upvotes and compliments? Because, honestly, it's like every other day there is some post titled "Quit Worrying!" Followed by a novel on how you're over stressing and you dont need to rush and you should just play at your own pace and enjoy yourself.
---
Is there anyone out there that actually needs this advice? Are people by the thousands freaking out and seeking emotional therapy on reddit? Why do people feel the need to regurgitate the same "Everything is going to be okay if you just stay true to yourself!" post every single day like they're god damn Sailor Moon summing up the moral of the episode?
---
Just let the people play. You dont have to tell them how they should feel.
---
&gt;Leader of the Pack just adds crit chance, has nothing to do with energy afaik.
---
Of course, you're right about this; it's really more about the fact that LotP means you're maxed in the Feral tree (and thus arguably maxed in Feral utility) at the same time you have Furor for energy shenanigans. And at 53 you can get the 30% mana discount for form changing, and 58 for the 10% extra physical damage, but tbh at that point you're probably starting to be worried about raids, and being a Feral DPS in a raid is an uphill battle.
---
Ok, this changes my mind completely about it. This is hilarious.
---
I look back at how I used to play vanilla from when I stoppled playing retails then into classic now. So much has changed.  
---
Key bindings and how in-depth my macros have become is the biggest change.
---
Reporting the stream as well
---
one of my pet peeves is people asking shit in trade/gchat that they could google in 3 seconds.  Yes its a social game but there's a fine line
---
That's why a quick google on tanking would imo make any problems I see while lvling disappear, I am sure the players can manage good play if they know how. I am not implying that they should quit tanking if they're not great at it, but if they're not great at it and they plan to do it, get great at it with the plethora of information we have available to us.
---
You a real one. +1
---
Since they're the ones who normally keep said game from shutting down...
---
I'm a rogue and I'm sorry but wiggling back and forth behind mobs increases my DPS by 5%, it's necessary.
---
Orc Twerk DPS strats for life.
---
TitanPanel! I feel like when I can see my stats I work harder to make them better. Like this morning, I was fumbling through a random quest and my xp per hour was lower than average. So I stopped and went to somthing better.
---
Is that our simple answer to questions in today’s world? “Google it, bitch.”
---
I love the opportunity to share what knowledge I’ve gathered on subjects, with people. It’s fun, and adds to the entire reason of learning; to share knowledge, not simply gain it. 
---
Try it sometime.
---
Yeah it’s because of this that I won’t be too surprised if Blizz launches WSG or AV by Christmas, to alleviate the beleaguered Alliance players on PvP servers.
---
I think in general, we probably share a lot of similar thoughts and we'd easily work together in a group perfectly fine. By no means should people be overspending their time between pulls unless it's necessary. If I'm in a group, I'd want the same things you would want for your group. 
---
If you gotta drink, drink as soon as you're out of combat. If you're a tank you understand the limits of your healer and how to not over-pull or pull too quickly. There's a balance for everyone and usually you can do it pretty fast and efficient if everybody's on the same page. I think i just have a different tolerance my perception of it all, idk.
---
&gt;do you get where i'm coming from!! please don't play the devil's advocate
---
&gt;i've never had a dps or healer complain i pull too fast, and i rarely meet a trigger happy dps that i can't handle  
---
&gt;are you saying my experiences aren't valid? 95% of my pug dungeon parties are fine, not perfect, but smooth enough. i've never had an inpatient player ruin a run
---
There's a balance and it can go both ways. In a similar way i can say that you're equally enabling the people on the other side that might actually be pulling too fast or being too trigger happy with dps. It's important to realize that just because 95% of your pug dungeons go smooth that there's people that can't say they share the same experience. If anything it just means that you probably are a warrior that knows how to tank and micromanage well in dungeons.
---
BRD in general can range a lot depending on if you're doing a full dungeon clear an quest run, which also is affected greatly by the gear and level of the people with you. In general 5 hours in BRD is a long time; Much more time than it should take.
---
The longest i was in BRD was the first time i went in when i was 53, barely had any decent gear and we didn't really have any 60s. Took us about 3.5 hours 'cause we went all over the place, needed to get key, had to complete quests, someone desperately wasted time doing coffer stuff and in the end we only got to the spot for MC attunement before calling it. The next day I went in with a group of 59s and a 56 and we cleared a bit and made it to emperor in half the time or less of that first run.
---
Undercutting at 1c only makes sense if it's a trade item that is moving.  Plenty of times you'll see less used things like certain herbs or BOEs that are arguably overpriced and you'll have to make the judgment call about whether or not the item is going to move at all at that price.  There's always the possibility of shooting yourself in the foot if you undercut too much but I definitely believe that you can entice buyers by offering an actual discount.
---
Like you said, people are trying to save money, so I think you also have people who are looking at the AH and flat out declining to buy at certain prices as opposed to later phases or retail where everyone is loaded and will just begrudgingly purchase the cheapest listing.  At least I have found myself doing that very frequently as the prices go up and down.
---
You aren't.
---
Was there a vanilla engineering mailbox?  that would be bonus for some one raiding with limited bag space and engineer.
---
Again most players don't focus on PvP on average. Sure it's gonna be more hostile (as it should be), but on most servers you won't get camped 24/7 in every zone.
---
Yeah, this makes no sense. Sorry.
---
Locks dots gets cleansed, curses gets cleansed, hunter stings gets cleansed, etc etc. I fail to see how a good team of rogue,mage, hpala loses to any comp other than meme setups like triple ambush rogues or pom pyro mages, or triple SL locks with x3 skill coils or something like that
---
??? The need/greed system is not a system that dictates how loot is to be split up. That is the players' job, the need/greed system simply allows players to declare priority for rolls. As a whole the MMO community has split or rolled for BoEs, my Boomer ass remembers this even in Everquest...
---
As for why BoPs are assigned to classes that can use them best- the utility for other classes is a few gold (vendor price) whereas for the classes that can use them the utility is much higher. Surely unless you breathe through your mouth you can see this differs from BoEs where the value is exactly equal for everyone since it can be sold?
---
How is it toxic to point out that some of the complainers need to self reflect and maybe think about upping their own game instead of always blaming other players? I'm trying to promote a healthier attitude here 
---
I am very good myself, having a blast in classic actually, playing arms but enjoying all the tanking I didn't realize I'd need to do because apparently quite a few other warriors find it too stressful 
---
I'm not feeling too eloquent right now and maybe worded certain sentiments too bluntly for Reddit but holyfuck. To me it's just sad reading all the self entitled complaining that gets spammed here... like come on...
---
It really isn't how it works. You're just jumping on that fearmongering bandwagon. If someone is out killing lowbies, 99% of the time it isn't some ruse to bring 60s, it's just some dude that is bored and wants to grief low levels.
---
I read a comment saying the stacking of these items is bugged in Classic and offering less than the 9% they're supposed to. 
---
Def worth using either way though. I use itemrack and keybind my riding set and non-riding set to ALT + mwheelup and ALT + mwheeldown
---
Well said lol
---
I'd just try to get 4k hp and 5k mana with as little cloth as possible.  Then mess with maxing SP and crit.
---
Shaman gear is only ok in these 2 phases.
---
That really sucks... I got it on my second run, and wasn’t even targeting the arena :/
---
It is not as low as you believe.
---
Anyway, this whole post point was trying to find solutions to the existing problems, not just sitting and saying "yup, that sucks".
---
Why slayers and not initiates?
---
Dude that’s awesome. Epyon is by far my favorite suit. Been playing the shit out of Gundam Ex Versus. 
---
If you want to be more salty, my guild has gotten 4 death bringers on the last 5 Onyxias 😂
---
Lol. Ubrs is so easy.
---
Like I said. 
---
That’s ridiculous.
---
Mobs at 2k life still deal full damage. If I'm doing well, sure I'll kite them, but we're not worried about players who are doing well, and once the dps dies because they pulled theat you be lost any time that burst would have saved you.
---
F
---
I'm not calling you that, just saying that retail players were a real issue in the early weeks.  Now...not so much, just here and there.
---
How much is the sub for the site?
---
&gt;enhancement shamans going healer
---
While I support "play what you want" in general, if it comes down to "We can run MC with some people respeccing, or we can't run MC because we don't have any healers," then this breaks down. Ideally the enhancement guys are in a guild with enough healers, or are helping to recruit more, etc. etc. Just like you wouldn't expect a rogue to re-roll priest, you shouldn't expect a hybrid to respec every week.
---
Fantastic work, the video section looks great.
---
Losing many weeks of work is a big deal
---
You said it yourself: 8/8 T1 makes Healing Wave more efficient than Chain Heal. Health per mana is actually important for Shaman. They run out of mana very quickly and need to use the most efficient spells they have.
---
You dont understand 1.12 av then. Av is the best honor when you can stomp with 8min games. It's been the meta on pservers for a while and that was with harder pre 1.12 av.
---
My old shadow priest is in that thread...somewhere :)
---
honestly, the problem zones are:
---
- STV
---
- Hillsbrad
---
- Blackrock mountain
---
Sure, they'll be random/more pvp elsewhere, but those places are the real issues. You should nearly be done with STV, hillsbrad should be finished but blackrock is gonna suck
---
I just remove armour ( to avoid durability loss), drown myself and run back to purple, the run out to use the portal again. I have yet to hear of a better way.
---
He's actually a trans... 
---
I was wondering why he just HAD to point out that he's NOT a dude... because he is one.
---
The upgraded R12/13 gear is equivalent to T2 in item level. Definitely not "Naxx quality" in terms of raw stat budget. It just uses that budget more efficiently than T2. Actual Naxx gear is highly optimized compared to everything else in the game in addition to being higher ilvl and blows even upgraded R13 gear out of the water.
---
Well there’s the scarlet crusade in the undead starting area, which I think would be fun. Just get a red shirt
---
&gt;Do you not understand how it works?
---
Proceeds to incorrectly explain how it will go down. So many players on this sub act like they know what they are talking about and just spread bullshit.
---
tbh it'd be like someone calling me blonde, i'm not sooo thanks? lol
---
Depends on your server.  You need to be in a certain percentile to keep ranking up.  If people are getting what they want and dropping out of the grind or not grinding that hard to begin with... not too bad.  If you have 2/3 of your grand marshal slots filled by accounts online 20+ hours a day and a large number of people farming massive rep trying to get that last GM spot?  Hoo boy.  Pack it in.
---
Also, how many slots were available back in the day was based on server population.  With servers much more populated I imagine that means more slots for those who care.
---
Now kith
---
Mods give zero fucks about people spamming their shitty streams, all of their attention is on removing memes.
---
Or you jump on an low level alt run to your boss and get killed from aoe revenge dhk.
---
You can get 4 honor kills a day (3 with DR) per target. They'll be worth 100%, 75%, 50%, 25% honor for kills 1-4 with 0 for anything past that.
---
6-8 hours a day? Those are amateur numbers
---
You definitely should quit.
---
Another player that thinks shit lag fests like nost were anything close to vanilla.
---
Please just quit, you are clearly bad at the game and ignorant.
---
Seemed pretty premeditated to me. Does it have an animation other than the sprite over your head?
---
Could you get paladin buffs on horde side this way?
---
ok boomer
---
So you basically made a clip of you streamsniping.
---
faerlina is meme, everything on this server is a meme. Why do you want to kill the only funny part of this?
---
Tyrs Hand.
---
Don't respec until you're 60.
---
Just hit 60 today. Will be camping 48s+ for weeks.
---
&gt;you cant buy arrows in gadget
---
Whoa i'd think you could in gadget... The more you know!
---
Yeah man between the tab targetting, all the abilities not on the global cooldown, and typing “attack the skull” mid fight, youre pushin carpal tunnel on every pull lmao
---
They’ve already announced phase 2 will be released the week of Nov. 12
---
Or just modify it so you have to damage the civilian to get the dishonorable kill.
---
Yea I saw some of the newer videos showing things.
---
Looks like he was mashing the macro button and it seemed really wonky.
---
What has me curious is blessing of sacrifices in combination with using blessing of sanctuary.
---
That's fair. If the person intentionally shared their account information they are to blame.
---
That's the only people they fight. They would never engage in an actual fight you are prepared  for. They would literally vanish and run if backup were to show up.
---
I don't pull groups just pats, 99% are 1 mob
---
I do this all the time in Retail, also buff people (I'm a priest), and most people act like they don't even notice. Lol
---
I'm happy playing the way I want to thank you.
---
They make sense to me on a druid.
---
It's why I love being a warlock. Sure man, go do your hearth, I'll bring you back. We can both save the day.
---
they were meant for the people who dont want to raid but still want to progress their character
---
Bro, i feel you man, i'm a 34 alliance on a horde dominated server
---
Once your engineering is high, you can make thorium shells and immediately convert them into arrows via a quest.
---
11 really? First 10 levels for any class should be ezpz. I can see how by 15 you'd get sick of it, but 11 is rather fast lol.
---
Go and kill every 5man mulitboxer, I don't like them either. But this guy is just awesome and committed. He played 18 days and just his lvl 28/29.
---
The game became harder not easier for him through multiboxing.
---
I did some Arena/Angerforge/Golem runs with a lvl 60 shaman who filled as a tank and it went surprisingly well to be honest, almost made me shaman tank myself ( if only I had the gear and the right spec!)
---
Been happening the past 2 days, just keep trying until it works
---
You seem fun
---
Raids: Bring mana potions and dark runes. Assigned curse, corruption if allowed, shadowbolt, lifetap. In current content it's almost certain healers have spare time and mana to heal you, if they don't your raid sucks. 
---
Dungeons: Balance HP/mana with LT and drink/eat between every combat. Observe group DPS. If high, don't bother dots unless boss, just shadowbolt/shadowburn. If group dps is low then work in more DoTs starting with corruption. Multidotting can be great, do a trial and see how your tank handles it, many tanks aren't good enough for it. 
---
DL/LT is an absolute last resort. It is HORRIBLE dps.
---
Hi, /u/tiddybean-curd

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/drnhxv/charming_blondie_takes_off_clothes/).

:O
---
As a resto druid who has no increased stealth, the ability to hide your nameplate can be a massive advantage, even if the detection radius is quite large.
---
Then don't be on a PvP server. Let people have their fun.
---
55 and up will be no problem at all. If you’re skillful in pvp (and there’s so much more room for error in wpvp), you won’t struggle getting the last 5 levels. Level 50 hunters will school 60 warriors and rogues in the open world aaaaall day. Mages even easier. Gear at this point is unimportant to a degree as long as you know how to successfully play your class.
---
Then once you get WW axe, fate will throw you a bone with a Ravager drop as a cruel joke.
---
They won't. There might be increased activity but you're right, they won't be looking to farm honor in stv...
---
Just wait til BC servers drop and you get that sweet Flight Form for easiest Herb gathering in the game.
---
Thanks man! Yeah I have kind of been putting it off, but now that there’s an easier way of farming it I’m hoping for the best.
---
If you think this game and or games in general were all designed with kids as the intended audience you might be a dumb ass
---
&gt; Even if HW5 with t1 bonus is more 'hpm' than Chain Heal with T2 bonus, a far bigger proportion of that healing is going towards the main target than it is going towards the raid, and the raid-wide heal is the whole point to cast Chain Heal.
---
Bear in mind this is Classic, not Retail. The 'raid wide' heal is actually 'melee range' for most bosses. You can't realistically heal ranged dps/healers with it in most fights (they're too spread out).
---
&gt; Even just in MC there's already a lot fights where you want to focus on Chain Healing and in which Priests don't want to be spread out into the groups. There are plenty of fights moving forward which don't require the amount of raid healing that you're going to be shifting Priests around the raid but which also benefit more from a Shaman Chain Healing the tank to help with raid healing.
---
There's no particularly good reason to be stacking your Priests. However, there is a very good reason to *not* be stacking them: Prayer of Healing. That being said, fights in MC aren't really healing intensive.
---
The first time you run across healing intensive fights will be Kazzak or Vael, where you will absolutely be doing what I described - splitting Priests across the ranged groups.
---
If you care about PvP then just stay in SL spec. You probably won't die to any 1v1.
---
CHT is going to be better than non raid swords but maybe not by an incredible margin. If you go the CHT route that’s fine but you will want to get Perdition’s later to MH and start to OH the CHT.
---
lol theres quite a few "racist" guilds on grob(although they aren't really racist. except maybe the dwarf only one on alli, idk if part of their RP is to be "racist" towards other races or not). This is our troll only guild, I think theres a few undead only, and theres one that doesn't allow undead. They are all great parts of the RP community!
---
Try being a balance druid
---
It will be in areas with 48+ level players. Noone is going to camp stv to farm honor
---
Witnessed a tank shaman in UBRS. I tanked alongside as feral and the run was great. They generate a shitload of threat and can pull with chain lightning.
---
Eh if that’s how you play good for you I guess. I pay as much attention tanking or DPSing and always have and I don’t find one or the other to be more difficult. 
---
DPS you can certainly *get away* with less effort but I don’t play like that and don’t think “you can be bad if you want” is how a role should be judged.
---
It’s like 3bucks. Cheap I know. But I’m not paying three dollars for it lol
---
Initiates slay me
---
I'm going to keep playing my way since it appears I won't be slowing anyone else down.
---
I suppose that depends.   For any sort of multi-pull (ex. Cleave) BoSanc will probably be better, if you’re doing single pulls, could go either way.  Outside of cleave GBoK, you aren’t going to front load more threat on a single target in a 5-man instance than with a DI holy shock.
---
Are you now talking about questing as a group? If you like that pre-make a group in town and then quest together?
---
As far as general grinding goes; Yes, you can grind twice as fast and kill more mobs, but again, you're still losing 50% of base loot and money AND potentially losing rare drop items. Also, being in a party of 2, you still only gain 50% of total XP while the total amount of received XP is still at the 100% threshold unless the party is 3 or greater. That is why I said grouping for grinding isn't necessary if you can farm efficiently yourself.
---
This is derailing from the initial question though, which was opinions on invites without whispers. **I ignore them without a second thought.**
---
If you level optimally, you can go 53-60 in 30 hours. I wouldn't bet on being able to with how you presented your skill level, but it is possible, and you will be very close. It's also not the end of the world to not be 60 for phase 2. It's just honor.
---
You will gradually lose honor (and eventually full ranks) if you fail to continuously pvp or if you get dishonorable kills (DKs). Those come from killing people too far below your level or killing quest giving NPCs. As for the time, it will take more and more as you go up in rank. The first few are easy. And even until like rank 8 you only need to average like an hour of BGs a day. You don’t start getting gear sets until around 9 or 10 I think, which is still pretty possible for casual players. After rank 10 it gets hard though. I’ve read that 13&gt;14 essentially requires you to make pvp your career for the next month or something.
---
Who said they had priority?
---
Just because someone "won" two pieces of loot doesn't mean that those weren't two pieces no one wanted.  Dude could have gotten a Vendorstrike and a piece of tier gear or some shit, highly doubt he came out with an Onslaught Girdle and a BRE.
---
I mean, you don't have to be in STV
---
BRD at 52 is tough unless you have guildies to run you, most groups want 54+ for full runs or for Arena/Anger because of the aggro ranges.  I found it easier to spam ST from 52-54, do all the quests there etc. then head to BRD.  I am a mage, so healers probably have lower level ranges, but just an FYI.
---
Anytime you engage in a social interaction you're taking time out of someone's day.
---
If you are doing so without adding value for them, you're potentially *wasting* their time.
---
If you are doing so without adding value *AND* you are asking them to give you an answer you could have easily solved on your own, you are most definitely wasting their time.
---
Save your questions for issues you couldn't easily solve on your own and we'll all be better off.
---
Dat Kolkar booty key tho..
---
This is literally the most common scenario and I see it in half or more of the people I pug. Lots of dps just want to burst their highest possible dps either AoE or single target. And of course were talking about a bad player, if the dps player in question is good then why are we worried in the first place? Evaluating the merit of a strategy employed by tanks is something that should focus on bad outcomes for variables outside their immediate control IE: the skill level of their frost mage or warlock.
---
Saying "AoE tanking is good with skilled coordinated players" is obviously true, but with endgame content this easy, anything works with skilled coordinated players.
---
So if you are between 55 - 75.. but you are totally hip and cool and with it... then you arent a boomer? But if you're 35 and active on Republican Facebook meme groups... you are a boomer?
---
If there’s anything, phase 2 further promotes the idea of traveling, playing as a group to repel ganking. In a way, I feel that it fosters players relationship even more.
---
With that said, player griefing and camping is there, I’m not sure what I can say that can dampen this negative impact
---
If it weren't possible to sabotage high levels I'd want killing lowbies to give dishonorable kills too.
---
Wait so long so long for something better?
---
Im under the impession that you cant get anything better. So what are you refering to?
---
" guys who start wiggeling their asses like crazy when standing behind a mob and trying to dps him. The ones that run in circles and jump back and forth while trying to do their thing... "
---
i do this a lot not out of impatience but because im really fidgety so you know maybe its you who needs to chill out a little.
---
There is a balance, but people not knowing boss fights (particularly from the leaders) is completely unacceptable. I'm a new player to WoW, and even after doing MC for multiple weeks now I pull up a raid guide every single night and review before every single boss. It takes less than 5 minutes of my time across the entire night, and can save 39 other people a wipe, so it's definitely worth everyone in the raid doing something similar. 
---
I'm not super concerned with clearing content NOW, because the raid rosters now are pretty mercurial, to say the least. Guilds on my server are already splintering and reforming, so there will always be raids out there with different levels of progression if you want to move up/down the ladder. To me though, I want consistency more than anything else. My guild's fairly mediocre, we're not winning any awards, but we're having fun and I think we've got a solid core that are in it for the long haul. We're already shedding the excess players that are just in it for themselves, or their own loot, so I expect our experiences to continuously improve as we go along. 
---
Finally, any guild advertising that they're clearing content in one night now, normally aren't steady players. They'll come in, play an absolutely massive amount, and then go AWOL other than raid nights for the rest of the patch. I don't generally like playing with these kinds of players, and my old guild is already having cracks starting to form from this type of behavior from the raid leaders.
---
Concretely, what will change ? How will it get tougher ? I’m a dwarf lvl 25
---
It's gonna get baaadddd for me. I had level 60 hordes camping every intersection in STV. And nestingwary, and the entrance to the north hub, and roaming to every quest spot, and the gy.
---
Also had horde take out South shore and body camp my group for an hour as we tried to get to sm. In addition to the absolute shit show the entrance to sm is.
---
That's just random low level greifing. It's going to be unplayable when someone gets honor out of it.
---
WoW classic for Private server players like Punkrat, is a Gold selling business.
---
They want people to spend time leveling so they can monopolize end game content. All the top guilds are run by Pserver players or streamers. They get the best gear, then they run gold raids, which you buy the gear that drops. They keep a majority of it after spreading it among the rest of the raid. Then they sell the gold for real world cash.
---
Of course the Devilsaur mafia is used for the same purpose.
---
This is why it's best to ignore every single person complaining.
---
I wager a lot of people don't know those quests exist.
---
Yeah but not everyone who plays the game is a no lifer who spends way too much time either farming gold or playing the AH. If a BOE has utility for someone's class they should be able to get priority on rolling for it instead of losing out to someone who just wants gold and having to buy it from that person for an insane price way over their means.
---
Got mine for 250g
---
Yeah, for casual Wrath babies who need LFD and free epics
---
Rofl changing the goal post again, amazing
---
98% really.  And the mace can give you 3% attack speed buff if you get iron counterweight...which some would argue is even better than Warden Staff.
---
I think they're wrong, but it's a 1% difference at that point...which I'm not paying 300g for.
---
How to beat shadowpriests as druid: pray that they are keyboard-turning clickers playing on dial-up internet. If they can shield themselves and dot you up, it should be a near impossible matchup.
---
I mean if you are grinding dungeons does it really matter? And when you hit 60 what are you gonna do? That's right farm dungeons, so you are gonna be affect somewhat by it no matter what.
---
is it also true you can down rank if you dont keep up with the curve your server has?
---
&gt;which severely hurts its price.
---
Not really. People will want whatever edge they can get.
---
Confirm Kurinaxx is a great ally server for me personally. It is heavy on the horde side however. Lots of helpful and nice players and still a decent amount of pug raids.
---
I was willing to buy the staff, until I got the Maul to drop...now, well...I'm not stupid.
---
Most druids I see don't care for hit cap, even in pvp bcus they are more about surviving, not relying on dmg
---
its always good to mix things up, so many more options than the standard 5 man group than can make the game more challenging and interesting.
---
Marking targets before the pull should help tremendously
---
Took me about 6-8 hours per level from 50-60.
---
I think you could definitely get there, or at least very close by the 12th.
---
The first few weeks are going to be a bloodbath
---
It’s the $ he’s counting as the 6th figure
---
If threat is really an issue you just start the fight with Tranquil Air so your tanks get enough threat then you drop WF, it's not really mana intensive.
---
Talk to your guild as gear is different for both specs in some regards. It might be easier for you to gear one or the other spec.
---
"Alter your experience", lol. It's literally part of the classic experience in BC, which will come about. Enjoy!
---
No of course it shouldn't, it should be judged by the median, which is definitely more "brain dead" than being super focused all the time.
---
And lets be real, you can get away with watching netflix or pornhub on your second monitor and still do respectable dps, whilst if you do that as a tank, you'll prolly do VERY sub-par in the fact that people will get hit or die or worst case scenario, you wipe. And that surely can't happen as a dps unless you actually TRY to pull aggro or extra packs and do nothing about it.
---
This was a great thread and I am commenting here to save it.
---
Warlocks need to get well acquainted with their bandage button.
---
You'll be gray to the vast majority of people who need honor.
---
Also just don't level in STV. I was one of the earlier 60s and even I didn't go there because other zones are safer and less contested.
---
Nice, thats surprising really ! 
---
The downfall of every viable off spec, the need for duel talents and gear lol
---
Both if you're warlock, but the slayer has slightly better drop rates for the eye.
---
Context?
---
You're a nice boy aren't you. Good at looking at things from the perspective of others. Do you speak to people like this in person?
---
Almost entire trip and I didn’t check I’m grandfathered into unlimited.
---
I think it was designed to be accessible to kids and played by kids, even as part of a wider audience
---
Oh lol you’re a Druid ! No wonder you should just reroll that shit class
---
You guys need any dps warrs?
---
And a key ring please...
---
15g and I only summoned about 10 people because once I summoned their locks it all went really fast
---
It’s not like skills have incidental cleave tied into them like retail. You literally have to be trying to kill anything but the leader.
---
So if some guy comes up to you on the street and asked you where the nearest Starbucks is you are going to answer..
---
Look on Google maps, stop eating my time!
---
Granted, Hunters are pretty decent in Ony.  And I'm not trying to say Hunter DPS is bad, but its just not topping meters on any fight in current raid content.  You can see the rankings on warcraftlogs.com if you need proof.
---
Meant phase 3, BGs is phase 3
---
I wonder if the back way will be fixed/broken..
---
Yeah idk what they're for other than helping me kill Sharptalon
---
I'm really not trying to brag, but this is just how it is.
---
I joined an established ex private server guild a few months before classic launched. They have my utmost loyalty, I will stay with them through Naxx and into TBC if blizz goes that direction. There is no other guild on my high pop server that even remotely compares in the competance and success my current guild exhibits. Worldwide there are like 10 guilds of comparable skill levels, and most are either horde or European so the options are very limited. If the guild somehow exploded I'd probably just quit wow.
---
My guild is a bunch of extremely competant min maxing try hards that have found incredible success this raid tier so far, and that is what I value the most. They're also a bunch of lovable assholes who crack jokes all of the time and like to have fun. That's also important but you can find that in like 90% of guilds. Wow guilds are full of wow nerds, we're all wow nerds, it's not hard to find common ground and have fun. If success is important that you don't stay for the friendship, success is hard to find, friendship is easy.
---
Lol that crit on Rag, but if you look at the dmg meter doing like half the damage as real dps.
---
Nah this is crap. There are plenty of people who aren't 60 yet who would like to raid.
---
Kevin Jordan: "Most of the world isn't breaking 6 figures a year, so with all due respect, go fuck yourself."
---
No it's fine.
---
Yeah, T1 for PVP is what I meant, so if you're gathering gear for PVE, you may as well pick T1. 
---
About T1 for PVE, with full T1 and good trinkets, necklace and so on you can hit 450ish +healing. I can check once I next log in, although I'm still missing Ramstein's necklace.
---
&gt;Noone will go to silithus for pvp when naxx comes out. It will be dead on arrival just like it was in vanilla. 
---
False
---
Talondeep Path. It even has a cave symbol on the map
---
I'm a (mostly) casual player. Your post makes me cringe.
---
Yes, casual players are important. Yes, certain people in the community can be toxic about it when new/casual players ask innocent questions that those elitists think are below them.
---
But here's the thing, saying that you don't want to look things up *at all* is saying that you just want other people to do your work for you.  That's not a healthy mindset either.
---
There are definitely times when asking is either quicker or more practical than looking things up. For instance, asking for a quick overview of fight mechanics while in a dungeon group or asking for help/or input regarding spec or rotation (which can be complex or feel overwhelming when you start reading conflicting information as a new player). But if you ask *every time* you need to know where a quest mob is, which mob drops a certain item, where you can buy a recipe, which stats you should be looking for, etc., you are doing yourself a disservice.
---
Spending a little bit of time doing basic reading or looking things up is part of the game, unless you just want to wander blindly around Azeroth. Which, I mean, you can--that's how I played through most of Vanilla back in the day and it was a wonderful adventure. Just don't get mad when everyone else who has been playing this game for 15 years isn't here for your blissful ignorance.
---
Also, if you're playing with a group at all, spending some time doing basic reading to understand what you should be doing as your class/spec is just good manners. If you want to run around solo as a feral druid wearing a + spell damage dress because it looks cool, be my guest. But when you're playing with other people, don't *expect* them to spoon-feed you a primer on how to play.
---
**Tl;dr**: Being a casual player doesn't mean being an ignorant player.
---
One of my pet peeves as a tank is when someone is strafing back and forth in front of me between pulls. Give your keyboard a rest my dude I've done this instance like fifty times and I'm gonna go slower just to spite you.
---
The fact that one gets to 60 without learning those things is beyond me, honestly.
---
Tanks get parried/blocked 30% of the time.  They also get CC'd constantly. Watch your threat its as simple as that. Play a mage maybe instead of dpsing constantly you can poly and decurse.
---
I didnt read long into this. 
---
You can solve all this without any problems. Just dont be an asshole and speak friendly to your group.
---
Lol not saying its stupid to buy. Im just saying its stupidly overpriced IMO. Seeing how its only for 1 class and one spec for that class. Before dm came out it really was the best option but now that it is...better to save ur gold n farm for the mace. The real stupidity is the fact it hasnt gone down in price since DMs release. Atleast not on my server. And personally I think the mace is better of the two anyways
---
why do so many people think players give dhk lol
---
You don't mount very often in there, unless your group wipes and everyone is running back. People might be a little annoyed if you're at least level 43 or 44 and don't have a mount. I'm all for playing your way, but you're gonna have a much more enjoyable time if you get your mount asap.
---
Did you even play Vanilla before DHKs were implemented?  Because this was not the case.
---
Guess we will see in a week.
---
It's actually about revisiting the game as it was, in the time that we originally played it. Obviously, this is not the best game you can possibly make, and some changes would be for the better. The idea behind not making any changes though, is that people will never agree on all the changes and as soon as you start with the "QOL" changes you'll end up with something similar to retail before you know it. That's not what this release of this game is about.
---
I found those descriptions too vague for my sense of patience :\]
---
Spending 4-6hours is Molten Core is fucking painful. Noone should have to deal with this shit. I am and it's my own personal chosen hell. Purgatory. Advise the raid to watch some fucking videos. Hold people accountable and make sure everyone is participating. Molten Core in an hour is a stretch. Molten Core in 6 hrs is just fucking lame.
---
the 305 giving 3% effective hit only applies to lvl 63 mobs
---
Punkrat must be one of the worst wow youtubers to follow.
---
Thanks for the information. Yeah, i want later the Perdition's Blade.  
---
You said CHT is better than non-raid swords, is it also better than raid swords? like Brutality Blade? And is Perdition's Blade better than the raid swords?
---
Nope just reality. I see how bad it is currently and it's gonna get way worse in phase 2.
---
What if I told you that 1 warrior can tank all the Garr adds while wearing pre-bis?
---
Awesome for Hunters as you can use it when a Mage is deadzoning you. I haven't used mine since leveling, though. Better trinkets out there once you get 60 I think. Super fun though.
---
Doesn't make it a kids game.
---
I can attest to this. I thought it was ez mode until 60 and found myself having to die 20 times to learn basically everything.
---
AoE farming is not as easy as videos make it look and you don't just auto win every duel by having pyroblast specced.
---
I'm trying as hard as I can, how am I ruining the game for you?
---
There's a reason killing another faction's leader gives a huge chunk of honor, and it's not "being a dick"
---
Hi, /u/22Sigi

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dro7vj/weep_near_wall/). 
---
Great response lol
---
private servers had dhk tho lol
---
Ah I see, yeah I am stoked for that.
---
It's sad that this post is buried at the bottom of the thread. Wow truly is about the social payoff, but most of the children who play this game aren't socially developed enough to appreciate that.
---
&gt; I don't think I'm in my own way at all thank you.  
---
Right, but thats the problem.  You don't even realise you are in your own way.  You are literally too stupid to grasp how stupid you are.
---
This is what Retaliation is for.
---
Honestly, classics story writing isnt really any better and alot of zones story was left unfinished or didnt really even have any story to it.
---
I have killed Broken tooth multiple times when I see Alliance trying to tame him, and it's not even that petty of me to do so I feel.
---
MY guild has basically committed 20 odd people to help our hunters tame Brokentooth, we form a raid and kill any alliance that come anywhere near the spawn locations so our hunters can tame in peace.
---
That being said we only do that for each hunter once, if say, you forget to feed your pet and it runs away yeah your not getting help a second time, looking at you Ocgmag.
---
Right next to the hearth location in IF is a vendor who will take your bullets and give you arrows.
---
I totally support what you're saying entirely on this comment. I think the toxic echo chamber of those examples you listed are examples of people being so petty.  No one actually learns from someone just being a dick because they're irritated at somebody for being dumb, ignorant, or in some cases just making an honest mistake. With the examples you listed, I'm behind you on that.
---
&gt; And you can open with multi-shot every pull before I even get a charge off my friend &lt;3 
---
Oh man, hearing this kind of stuff makes me facepalm so hard. You'd think not multishotting out of the gate would certainly be common sense?
---
*laughs in mage*
---
They're fun to play, but not as a resto on raids. It's why I went shaman. I usually love healing but as a druid it was underwhelming.
---
Life tap?
---
30% between block and parry. Also not counting being dodged and if your tank is even hit capped.
---
This is the most Horde thing I've ever seen. You just know they play undead rogues and all their names start and end with the letter X
---
You probably still want to move to different zones though, as there's much better fish that you can cook into higher level food that gives better buffs, such as +10mp5 from Nightfin Soup or +10agi from Winter Squid. Leveling Fishing makes leveling Cooking a breeze. They also fetch good money on the AH if you don't want to cook them yourself.
---
You dont need to kill the hyena pack.  Just let it pat by, you just have to jump down if the king/chorush are near the patrol on their way back to you.  You have to time you FD's right so that the hyena pack patrols by you while the king/cho arent near.
---
better than having 7 rogues on each ony raid and never even seeing the helm drop in 6 runs
---
When I look up the gear, it appears to require wsg, av tokens, etc ... Which won't be out yet? Is this also going to be changed?
---
its a bit of self justification... and ironic at the same time.
---
You life tap to support your team? I didnt realize you life tapping gave others mana too, TIL
---
I like the comic book analogy, but that's too nice for me, I'd say it's the plot of a shitty anime, where the main baddie has a random power spike that puts them on level with god, and is able to beat someone previously considered ultra powerful.
---
Hmm... I’ve had best luck with max range.
---
It seems that if you heal/HoT/Buff a party member in combat, it will try to put you in combat regardless of range. 
---
Which is likely why my 2nd point (sometimes you stay out of combat) doesn’t always work.
---
There have been rare occasions where I can gheal+renew+drink and then gheal+renew+drink again and be at full mana before the pull ends.
---
On e you can do brd is it enough xp to just repeat until 60? Or would it become really slow and not make sense
---
Wow I never implied anything like that
---
Exactly...also +defense really isn't a main tanking stat for bears anyways. Since they dont gain the +block/parry from the stat. The main lose is the 10 armor from warden. And yea def aint worth 300g+ but anyways grats to OP for some good gold you'll def get selling it
---
I think they are set amounts not nesesarely automated conversions.
---
there's like 4 shortcuts in stonetalon if you're horde.
---
It’s why people should start tanking at early levels.  The dungeons are much more forgiving then.
---
"But I already cleared it couple times with no problem" (actually carried by high lvl group)
---
Isn't the new Call of Duty out? What are you still doing here?
---
I'm really hoping the freakout has basis in reality... I want to bathe in the blood of my enemies while leveling. I want to hunt, corpsecamp rogues until they are bawling, run and hide from high levels, be scared shitless and generally fuck people up. 
---
phase 2 can't come soon enough.
---
TL;DR no story is better than bad story?
---
Yes, a ton of people need this advice. I see so many casual/ newer players stress stress about falling behind or constantly ask what they should be doing or where they should be questing, always in fear that they're not doing the most optimal meta thing.
---
It’s gonna be crazy until BGs come out especially if you are 48+. Once BGs are out you won’t see the gank squads as much. Even low levels you will have a reason to gank while leveling (to unlock pvp trinket)
---
Some of the most fun dungeons have been with new players. You get to see these dungeons through their eyes to a degree and it’s a nice reminder how cool and unique some of the dungeons felt.
---
Helped run a couple of 53’s through BRD. They were doing it for the first time. Was really cool to see their reactions to the environment and encounters
---
Limp Biztik style
---
Well, yeah that goes without saying.
---
" i have support spells too" "life tap" life tap is not a support spell.
---
No, my initial claim was horde try harding is going to lead to people quitting. The imbalance just makes the try harding even more overbearing then it normally would be.
---
I mean, your guild is 9/11 for the current phase. You are clearing content.
---
Yep never happens. People don't have raids vs raids full of 60s fighting in southshore. You're right.
---
Do you know how much gold is yielded before accepting the quest?
---
I have no idea, i don't play it.  You seem to be aware of its release though.
---
Congrats dude! Nice 77 roll... oh... oh :(
---
If you don’t want to respect once you’re 60 just switch to Ds/ruin while leveling. You get improved healthstone, a nice chunk of stam while the destro will help your dps in dungeons. Mess around with a talent calculator to figure out where to put your talents first, its hard to give you advice without knowing your level.
---
You are right the best way to farm honor isn't roaming around a zone, but having huge battles isn't the best way to farm honor either. The way the honor system works incentives honor farming groups on opposong factions to ignore each other. You never want to have real fights you just want uncontested kills. The best way to farm honor is going to be camping flight paths and instance portals most likely
---
At least you have a Corpsemaker. So many warriors and shaman running RFK I never won a roll. I’m still sporting a Crescent Staff from WC quests, trying to slowly kill trolls for tusks.
---
Ya that's not true at all. Any hit you can get at low levels is worth getting unless you can get hit capped via talents against same level mobs.
---
Today I learned you cannot support yourself, it’s a support spell as it supports you ability to cast more dps spells or cast other support spells.
---
Yeah, so earth shock is unique - in that it does double damage straight up as threat. Rockbiter weapon, add's a flat amount of extra threat based on rank. Rockbiter is more like how druid/warrior threat generation abilities work - whereas Earthshock is one of the only spells that is based on whether it deals damage.
---
Admittedly, this is where shaman tank's have a failing. Missing hurt's alot. That said, what's cool with rockbiter is it adds such a high amount of threat if you have a high attack speed weapon applying it over and over - you can typically just tab target and continue to only earth shock your primary target and by the time your party switches target's nothing is leaving you.
---
&gt; I just hit 48 on my main last night. RIP me.
---
Ye I would unequip some gear before u take flight path if i were u. I don't see any reason to giga hurry leveling but there's definitely gonna be a raid or two AoE farming people at key fp's
---
Use a 1hander and skull of impending Doom. Druid is all about utility and kiting, only ever use wardens staff when you're getting bursted by melee, otherwise, when fighting things like mages, kill them as bear with a MCP.
---
is this Chris Metzen?
---
Fuck punkrat
---
I dont know what ovaries you've been hanging out with LOL
---
Hide it under a rock
---
“Other classes loot”
---
Hacent hit 60 on classic yet in vanilla quests did not convert xp to gold. I thought this was a new thing when BC came out was it changed late in vanilla?
---
I believe so, once I dinged 60 the rewards on the displayed quest log seemed to be higher.
---
When anyone wonders where the sense of community went I'm going to point them to this comment.
---
When people said Retail grew so toxic, I never really understood since I had not played WoW in a decade. Thanks for helping me clearly see.
---
Yes. Wowhead also show gold gained at 60.
---
Thank you for understanding my point. So many retail crossover players that only care about clearing content as fast as possible didn't understand this post - it's about having fun. Shaman tanking is fun as hell.
---
jo' mamma
---
Ya mon!
---
You won’t have to do brd to 60 but you could, there’s also ubrs/lbrs, scholo, and strat
---
The topic is open for discussion of you can offer ant substance. Seems you won't though.
---
Yep. Best of luck to you.
---
IT CANNOT BE UNSEEN
---
You, are already, dead.
---
I wasn't guessing what its going to be like. I was basing my prediction off of what it has been like the last few days since they announced the honor release coming on the 12th. I'm not even on a badly imbalanced server or a busy one and there is still horde camping graveyards, flight points, neutral quest locations and dungeon entrances on most if not all the high level zones even on non peak hours. If its this bad now when there is no reward for it, it will be much worse when doing this will get them honor and gear.
---
if pre setup yes , not just randomly
---
1. Yes, honor decays. To put it simply, your accumulated honor decays by 20% each week when you are gaining honor, or 10% when you aren't.
---
2. To reach the highest ranks you probably will, although I'm not sure how people will try to farm honor in wpvp.
---
3. Pre-bis may be okay, if you want to do better in pvp you may want more stamina in particular, and you don't need as much hit. It's also worth noting that honor is more related to how much pvp you do than how successful it is.
---
Mmmm death by snu snu.
---
My hunch is they will drop BGs early to alleviate these issues when the qq reaches a fever pitch or lears to unsubbing. Plus for PvE servers p2 provides very little so it makes sense they'd get a BG or p3 out sooner.
---
Could run ST for a couple levels then start BRD. Definitely hard to level a warrior solo on PVP at the moment. I'm ally on Skeram and haven't ran a non-dungeon quest in 5 levels or so.
---
Yeah, personally never thought much of the writing in game. That one didn't seem any better or worse to me. I'd wager a guess that a lot of the hate came from people who quit retail long ago and only care about classic now. I haven't given a shit about the last few expansions, but looks pretty dope, might give it a shot if I'm not classic/new Doom game.
---
Shadow Mastery/Ruin or Demonic Sacrifice/Ruin will both suit you well in dungeons.  Those are also comparable in terms of raid damage output.
---
And even if you don't have the time, that's fine. Go at your own pace and join a late to the party raiding guild. Raid a couple hours a week and that's all it takes. Or just do pvp.
---
Yes, in av you get a lot of iron forge or orc (I think) rep and some for everyone else.
---
reagents?
---
With AQ they introduced weapons with feral AP. You typically switch to a mace with 300 feral AP at some point to keep up with the threat.
---
We've got 10 mages. Netherwind has dropped once. Though it's not as good as Arcanist so that's not actually that big a deal. The dearth of caster drops (two useless, one went to a priest for some reason) in the last three MC runs is a much bigger issue.
---
LoL
---
Says anyone with a brain.
---
people are like on high speed rail mode.  I need 15 seconds to eat/drink something but no.... we have to be constantly moving.
---
Its not as efficient but you can die in ashenvale and just run there as a corpse as i did. Also its just +10stam as a heads up.
---
I'm not talking about a sub-54 group. Where did I say that? I'm talking about a group appropriately leveled for a full clear which means 56-58. Maybe 55 for the healer. A group that will be able to clear the entire dungeon, doing quests, all bosses for a full clear, the first few times they step in a dungeon. 
---
Of course you can do it faster. You're talking about a higher level groups that is skipping groups with lower agro radius so they can skip more pulls. Of course it's faster if everyone knows what they're doing and outlevels/outgears most of the content.
---
As others said, I also enjoy the Wetlands Whelp grind. It's so easy and relaxing as a Druid. You just oneshot everything with Moonfire and pick up Briarthorns for Swiftthistle. It can make for a nice g/hr.
---
SoS Whelp spot is also nice, but kinda small so if you get contested, it falls off pretty hard.
---
Rock Elementals in Badlands can yield some nice g/hr.
---
I have one more rather low level grind spot which might the favorite but I'm hesitant to share because for it being so lucrative, I don't get much traffic there and I would like for it to stay that way.

You are, for mitigation wardens is always BiS, and for threat, MCP is always BiS.
---
Welcome to the joy of rolling alts and knowing (some of) the tricks
---
Speaking of levelling characters.
---
Why wouldn’t he. 
---
It’s BIS.
---
He’s fury tanking.
---
Alliance seems to have way more:
---
1.	The Hillsbrad humans and Dun Garok dwarves in Hillsbrad Foothills
---
2.	Dalaran/other humans in Silverpine Forest/Alterac Mountains
---
3.	Dabyrie Farmstead and ⅓ of Stromgarde in Arathi Highlands
---
4.	Non-Scarlet Crusade humans in Tirisfal Glades
---
5.	Bael’dun dwarves in Mulgore and the Barrens
---
6.	Northwatch humans in the Barrens and Kul’tiras humans in Durotar
---
7.	Various night elves in Ashenvale
---
8.	deserters/other tower humans in Dustwallow Marsh I think
---
9.	dryads and treants in Stonetalon Peak
---
I think that’s all of them, versus just the Warsong Orcs in Ashenvale and Hammerfall Orcs/Forsaken in Arathi I think
---
Tanks don't even want to do dungeons man, you take what you can get. Whenever my guild tanks are on I'll take them if they want to go (and usually they are) but yes I did PUG when I needed dungeons. I'm not complaining about bad tanks, I end up unloading anyways cause I just hit FD right away. 
---
But then other dps pull aggro anyways. I've never seen any tank bitch about it in the group and I've only ever seen 1 dps start trashing on the bad tank then they both left but that's it. The amount of tank bitching on here is insane though, and those are bad tanks.
---
Twinking does a lot to ruin the fun of 10-19 wsg for everyone but twinks, but calling it an exploit is just silly.
---
You'll never be able to raid then. The whole point of new phases is to give you the classic experience, which is learning how to raid and wiping. If you raid with the elite guilds, you aren't experiencing it properly
---
Gastly very interesting to say the least.
---
There’s something really satisfying about having all the keys in the game.
---
To add to this, or he just doesn't have a goal to work towards.
---
We kill Ony with ease, just run out of time for rag pulls. We only got maybe 3 good rag pulls down last week and got him to 20ish%.
---
Guy sniped one of our ghoul ghosts in EPL since anyone can click on the spirits once they die.  My group mate and I said “fuck that” and followed him.  He went up to do Hameya so we claimed it from under him.   And again.  And again... he finally got fed up and left, sending us angry tells.
---
What we did wasn’t right, but he deserved it.  It was clear he didn’t think what he did was wrong and he learned nothing from the aftermath.
---
Get a real job.
---
Oh no!  You chose to roll on a PvP server and then PvP activity happened and it stymied your progress?  Golly gosh gee it's almost as if maybe your experience matched your choices.
---
At the same time - why are you bothered by it? I mean, what should this subreddit be? Should it be only and strictly min-maxing material?
---
I like the discussion on a wide variety of topics, even if they are as it seems to you, unnecessary. Not all of us are strong silent types who wished everyone just kept to themselves.
---
I agree but you said you would give the same response to someone asking for directions to Starbucks. 
---
What about being civil outside this sub? I’m arguing that your behavior is not civil at all.
---
I did brd from 50- 54 but never went beyond arena until 52 and then never beyond golemach from 52-54
---
Yep, a lot of the people who glorified PvP are going to get a sharp reminder that it’s not as much fun as it was in their heads and that repeatedly dying to organised groups farming honour isn’t much fun.
---
Because you are saying you cant fucking google something and want to be spoon fed information. Dude get over yourself
---
This dumbass is still replying and trying to flex that he's doing a PhD on a WoW subreddit lmao. Go back to studying and stop @ing me about your irrelevant life, mad kid.
---
It's a pretty great place to be as well.  Not like you're stuck in a crappy instance like Uldaman.
---
I believe you need 6%. I tested out 5% hit and i was still missing some specials. 6% seems better. I havent seen a miss yet on a special. This is 300 weapon skill on a rogue.
---
I honestly prefer the way it is now. Before you could wipe a raid 5 times and have 200 skeletons. A person venturing into the mountain 15mins later, does not know that and assumes there was a huge battle. If there are now 200 skeletons, you know shit went down!
---
Okay dad.
---
Should have came with dire maul...
---
Its 9 levels, so at 51.
---
Correct
---
Should I just become passive? I'm solo leveling as a 56 warrior and tend to leave the opposite faction alone while they quest as well. I get ganked about once an hour by level 60s and it seems that if they kill me I just walk back to my corpse and wait for 5 mins and I'm good to quest again. But when I'm eating after a fight with quest mobs and get charged by a 60 warrior and kill him with grenades/pot/bandage they dedicate the next hour to making sure I can't play. It seems as though I should just die without a fight so they don't get butt hurt about losing...
---
I just used Questie and look on the map to find out which zone I should move over based on the level required and amount of quests.
---
They mean in the instances BRD, LBRS, UBRS.
---
The mountain itself will be chaos.  But a few corpse runs will get you where you need to be.
---
Hehe thanks dawg. Being in the top 15 as ele is fine with me ;)
---
&gt; I believe firmly in two things. 1. That people should be "taught to fish". And 2. That as part of the social contract we should try to be respectful of the one resource none of us can get back, time. 
---
This is definitely something I can agree with and subscribe to
---
Hey man thanks for checking it out
---
This is a pretty good guess I'm betting.
---
This is the important facts I needed to know! Thank you for that I appreciate the knowledge !
---
I don't really know any fights horde has a large advantage on other than Viscidius.
---
And unless my list is wrong, the majority of world firsts in Naxx and AQ40 were all alliance, with Death and Taxes getting most of Naxx and Fury AQ40.
---
Also someone seeking social interaction in a socially interactive game doesn’t make them lazy.
---
Nope, never in my life.
---
Maybe you should actually try doing a city raid before commenting on this thread anymore.  You clearly don't know wtf you're talking about.  You cannot city raid successfully without AOE because of the guard spawn mechanic, you loose doorknob.
---
Why put it on to see that the mobs are targeting me when I mostly play solo?
---

You honestly thought you were going to get sympathy with this post, huh? I'm willing to bet this kinda thing happens to you a lot...
---
Players don't give DHKs
---
What character name and Alliance or Horde? Good to see another kilrogg player after so long haha
---
Mannnn you're throwing away a transmute, refined deeprock salt, or mooncloth CD doing this.
---
Unless you realllly want the gadgetzan transporter instead of everlook you should really just drop for goblin on your main.
---
It shows all the available quests near you level on your map, if you are too high/low level for certain quests they will not appear on your map.
---
So it won't tell you to move to X area at level 25, but you'll find that area you were in before no longer has quests, and the area adjacent to it has a ton ready to be picked up.
---
I totally do this because it makes my character look silly.
---
Side benefit, it also keeps me alert
---
Yes I had sham tank when our tank dropped the party. It was ok, 1 wipe in 3 runs
---
Trying to level after the pvp system is implemented will be nearly impossible.  48+ You will have to just do dungeon grind....  Saying "Don't worry about it is fucking nonsense".   That's like saying dont worry about climate change.
---
Amen.
---
Dude I’m always looking for a enhancement shaman for dungeons. If I had that and power infusion I know I’d be doing like 800-1k dps on pulls
---
You clearly don't have a bug-a-salt.
---
For me it was camping the Felwood FP. As soon as I dropped I was dead lol. Jumped on the alt, ruined any fun these guys could have by camping me.
---
Or have been an Alliance.
---
The guide I was using in Guidelime directed me from quest to quest through levels. Told me when to grind xp so i would be ready for the next zone.  
---
From what I gather they are trying to be the most efficient route possible so you aren't running back and forth empty handed.
---
Leveling now, as it is, without p2 pvp system is a nightmare. Alliance gank you everwhere and anywhere. On smolderweb, there is alliance that camp hillsbrad for 6+ hours per day. There is a shadow priest that camps the exits of gadgetzan every single day and a guild that does nothing but run through leveling zones killing lowbies.
---
Getting to BRD, LBRS, etc. sucks already. There is always a group there killing people. When they have incentive to, I imagine it can only get worse.
---
You can't do city raids without damaging civilians.  They aggro from a ways away, have next to no HP, and you can't realistically single target down the 40+ guard spawns.
---
Good tip! Itemrack addon can also do this + do outfitter stuff
---
Get new material.
---
You know this is a pvper and is finding killspots.
---
You ever seen a orc with no hair? Jamie pull that up. *leans into mic* oh shit that thing will fuck you up.
---
Unless you are a moonkin
---
The title?
---
you're dumb dude 
---
druid tanks literally allow me to blade flurry off cooldown and go absolutely bonkers.
---
you're just trying to be edgy but you're making yourself look dumb. probably not worth it lol
---
you should change your name to "SaltyLemons" cuz you are salty AF. chill out man its a game, 5 mans are not hard its not like you are playing Dark Souls or something lol locks have no threat mitigation talents i see them pulling all the time. 
---
not saying there is no bad tanks out there of course there are, just like there are garbage locks. its part of the game, be the change you want to see, don't just rage and tell people to stop tanking lol thats not productive.
---
Precisely

The high elves in the hinterlands and the gryphons
---
"Put more lootboxes in."
---
That untrue. There are few playing druid. I every raid there is at least 3 druids on my server.
---
 pvp server players usually like and engage in pvp.
---
Who actually wants to be responsible for wiping their raid because they didn't go into raid night watching a 10 minute video on how to clear all the bosses?  Are you really this fucking naive?
---
If there were as many Orcs as there are Humans you would never be able to get to your car.  They would mug you, they’d rip your fucking feet off, and fuck your ass...
---
I'm not at all. I'm pointing out the differences. You're the one who sounds biased here mate. In fact most people seem to be disagreeing with you significantly. "Small impact buffs" lol
---
I've never heard these buffs referred to as small impact before.
---
It's the Moops!
---
Yeah and i feel like its worse to me when its my own faction
---
He was not streaming this.
---
Wrong.  Guards spawn. You have to AoE them down because they cannot be taken out single target.  Civilians are fuckin EVERYWHERE.  They *will* get hit by AOE, tanking the entire raid's honor.

---
For straight up 5man dungeons, i suggest SM/Ruin. That spec still provides you with all your utility and sustainability while dealing okay damage. Plus, you get to use your demon for group buffs/CC.
---
Call in reinforcements but chances are they are doing it to everyone and anyone at that particular bottle neck.
---
I'm expecting it 100% of the time in a week.
---
Yeah you didn't suggest it I just thought it was relevant to throw out there cuz some people like to say holy shock is a good PVE tool, I tend to disagree. 
---
At least seal of righteousness lasts awhile, so you can easily cast it + drink again to be full mana and not have to also waste the mana cost of the seal itself.
---
I watched a video where the person was saying that the guide he had would tell you to grab these quests, then grind out to the next level, wait to turn them in, go do these other quests, keep killing these greens to 75% of level, then go turn in, etc.
---
He made it seem like these guides were actively adjusting to your current progress in real time, so I wasn't so sure if they were this advanced or more rudimentary.
---
That's the yellow hit cap if you're under 11% as human or 14% as anything else you are sub optimal. How can you think going to yellow cap is sufficient?

---
Yes I've done city raids in vanilla, my guild used to team up with our sister guild and do random raids when we were bored.. yes we got dks, no I don't care lol.
---
Lol you have it backwards. I’m a millennial replying to the most boomer statement on here. “Just don’t be stressed.” So clueless.
---
Yeah, PvPers are their own worst enemy. This time they wont have flying to blame for killing world pvp so I wonder what they will blame.
---
&gt;then a group of horde shows up and world pvp battles break out.
---
except that part doesn't happen even most of the time...  Either way you are dead, and cannot level.
---
Yeah i didn’t know that was a faux pas either, i guess cause i just do dungeons
---
Jesus you make a comment that, as a tank, is 100% correct, and get absolutely flamed. “Just taunt” “just sunder and Revenge” like it’s that easy. Do they know how rage works? Do they realize you’re slowed and now have to chase back and forth between all the ranged running away from you with your back turned?
---
Holy shit the responses to this are making me so mad. Exactly how I think DPS think.
---
Yes, absolutely report. In general, blizz doesn't refund scams, but they take it back from the scammers and punish them so totally report it.
---
You should always have people log onto their main and say "hey invite XXXX please" and switch over. Not message from the new alt.
---
I’m going to add heavy runecloth bandages to the list. I had initially skipped out on first aid while leveling, simply because I'm a healer. Why bandage and waste some cloth when I can just press the heal button? Because it's an incredibly useful almost full heal to someone without using Mana. Yes taking damage does cancel the bandage, so use with caution. Or apply PWS and bandage. This is useful anytime you're oom or trying to organically regenerate Mana without activating your 5 second rule timer. I do this pretty consistently in the rag fight. After he submerges and the fire adds come out, a lock should be banishing the last elemental giving everyone some downtime before rag reappears. Take this ~20-30 second period to get your Mana back, and heal yourself and others with those bandages
---
Nah Druids are basically just there so we can easily identify the autists
---
No, because everybody can use pretty much all mats for something. Therefore all need or none. Mats are just too abstract and you can't make sure that the person will actually use them.
---
A BoE item can be equipped on the spot to become soulbound, no such thing with the 13g pristine diamonds.
---
You’re doing it backwards!
---
Now i want to build a pom pyro shatter build actually and try it out if it's good.
---
It’s easier to change the way you do things if you want to see a difference, rather than trying to change everyone around you. 
---
If you smell shit everywhere, check under your own shoes.  Not mine. You literally wrote every solution to the problems you’re having in this post. 
---
Takes 25 words or less to answer your own questions. Every experienced player has done it. It’s your turn
---
How much are you paying a tank??? I would only charge like 20 gold for a run like that, and I would expect people to split the cost
---
Its generally about the time between logs.  If theres a reasonable time gap (travel time)  you should be fine
---
SHAME! SHAME!
---
9int i suppose
---
Well most players who plan on how to do it don't realize what it takes anyway. Probably not a regular reddit poster.
---
&gt; What is the average of these three numbers: 10.00, 10.00, 10.00?
---
I didn't read further. You fail to understand the very concept of what we're talking about; guilds don't clear at the same time every run, people don't run at the same time every race.
---
But you know that. You are being of bad faith. Since you cannot accept to lose a point, are of bad faith and won't even have the courtesy to thank someone for educating you, get blocked.
---
My brother and I had issues with in-game chat. We decided to go with Discord.
---
In my experience, almost every game that has a built-in voice chat has garbage, buggy-quality chat.
---
Okay 1 more. Can a 15 year old be a boomer? Just trying to see how far detached this new lingo meanning is from the actual meaning
---
As a resto sham it is so tempting to spec ele or enhance when that hits. But I dont have the gold to respec weekly cause Im no use to my guild dping in raids. :')
---
Amen brother
---
Guards literally do not aggro you in the back of the building, its different then being somewhere they cannot path
---
They arent really. And the gap gets larger with gear because shadow mastery only apllies to the spells base damage while the +15% from sacc scales with +dmg because it applies to your total damage dealt.
---
Im doing the same build, heal pve but both in pvp. I cant decide between the +10% damage vs healing, myself. Thing is that neither apply to spellpower gear, its just a flat increase to your base
---
It really depends on trash discipline. If you dawdle, MC is still going to take 3-4 hrs in my experience but if you whip the members a bit so you don't have 40 members gawking at the loot master while the loot is being sorted, but move on to start clearing to the next boss meanwhile you'll have a much better cleartime. 
---
Like FreyrPrime says the actual kill times for bosses are like 2 minutes except for ragnaros who's like 4-6 minutes, so keeping clear times low is \*not\* about how fast you kill the bosses. Keeping up the pace during the mountains of trash are where you really shave off time.
---
This HAS to be a troll.
---
Oh NOW you tell me.
---
Exactly. I can't be sure my one auto attack didn't trigger both sword spec and thrash, but there are times where both animations happen at the same time and other times when they're staggered by like 0.2 seconds or something.
---
I was just asking if it was in patch notes or a blue post from back in the day.
---
And even if you don't, you can run ZF  and ST untill like 54. It's gonna be fine. A bit inconvenient for a while but there are solutions
---
Maybe I jumped from a PvP server to a PvE server at the perfect time.
---
I was never a fan of PVP.  It never worked out how I imagined it (dueling the other faction) and ended up being a gank-fest.  I don't gank (not worth my time) so all it becomes is avoiding being ganked.  I like leveling alts, so I'm always the lowbie getting ganked.  And even on my 60, waiting by a locked instance for the rogue to appear and I get jumped, or landing at Thorium Point and being ganked by 6+ horde just wasn't fun.  The worst was when I only have a half hour or an hour between my day and night job, and I spent the entire session corpse-camped.
---
My best friend wanted a PVP realm, so I went to play with him.  I finally got to the point where I told him if he wants to duo with me, we can play a PvE realm.  I got nothing out of being on a PVP realm but frustration and missed opportunities.
---
It's going to be much more fun for me to be able to actually play the damn game.
---
&gt;because if your goal is to farm honor, you want to go where the prey is.
---
Which is BRM. You want to go where you're most likely to find the opposite faction in larger numbers. I can roam around Felwood, Ungoro, etc as 60 and gank low 50s. Or I can sit in BRM with some friends and gank groups of people trying to get into BRD/BRS. My prey is coming to me. Lots of it.
---
Just hit level 51 with my mage and I’ve read a lot of previous posts about how i should be running BRD and so forth for BIS and whatever else. What’s a good level to start doing this from? What dungeons should I run for certain gear?
---
Join the rest of the world and use Discord.
---
Healing power for pre-hots.
---
I dunno man, I disagree with the other two commenters saying that this is just how it goes... Blizzard differentiates between some 'good ole world pvp' and 'griefing' players. Camping a corpse all day can be considered disrupting gameplay in some cases.
---
I'm not sure where this one falls, but I think it would be worthwhile to either make a post on the official forums or submit a ticket in-game to get an official response. 
---
I don't mind being killed here and there, even several times in a row. You can always swap to an alt or take a break for a few minutes. That's part of playing on a PvP server. However, being mind controlled and polymorphed for 30 minutes solid while your party waits on you seems like a step too far to me.
---
Unfortunately there's no real hard coded black and white definition of harassment so it has to be decided on a case by case basis. I wouldn't trust Reddit (no offense) to make that decision for me. Let the people who's job it is do that. 
---
Lastly... I wouldn't expect much from the GM's. They seem to be swamped with tickets or something and are pretty consistently giving us shitty template based responses rather than actually looking into these things. Or maybe I'm just bitter that they won't restore an item that I cannot restore myself and cannot obtain in any other way. I don't even know why I care about that stupid little pet, other than the fact that most people can't get it and don't have it. I think maybe I'm still salty that their only suggestion for me to get the quest item back is to re-roll my level 50ish main. (lvl 50 at the time, now I'm 60 and there's no way in hell I'm going to take another month to reroll a toon just for that damn pet.) /rant
---
İ am Tank.
---
The death ray only requires 240 engineering and gnomes get +15 engineering.
---
Feel like I have cleared LBRS in an hour many times doing the jump
---
I'm not opposed to tossing a point into Kings, I'm just curious if there are any threat numbers based on the other blessings more than anything.
---
If you have an authenticator you'll be fine
---
Discord has so many features now it’s hard to recommend anything else.
---
Guild runs?
---
Oh man, that’s optimistic. Why fight the pack of raid geared 60s when there the ungrouped shitty geared 55s-59s that also give me honor and are magnitudes easier and probably more plentiful? If I’m out hunting for honor, I’m not going to smash my head against a pack when I could be watching Netflix and mop up under leveled plebs with my eyes closed. If I’m hunting for engaging pvp, I’d be at BRM or hillsbrad.
---
I did this through my 40s and until 58. Well, basically I was arms tanking everything and aggro was a non issue. 
---
I’m of the thinking that those non elites aren’t my problem and not are the fucking little rats and grubs.
---
Is there a good DKP addon?
---
Definitely faster to just use an alt or a friend
---
Just to add 1 important detail... its not the honor that directly ranks you up. You get rank points based on how much honor you have compared to everyone else.
---
Fuck Rank14, I’ll see you at Rank15, pleb. Gohardorgohome.
---
I've heard about this wpvp fantasy for years, but it never manifests in game.
---
Yeah all the addons vary somewhat, so I can't tell you exactly how they all work, but in general they act more as guides than anything.
---
Maybe it was actively adjusting in real time, but you really don't need something that detailed unless you are desperately rushing to 60.
---
Don't do it or you'll immediately be perma banned.  I recommend writing a letter to Blizzard's corporate office an Anaheim addressed to J Allen Brack so he can review your account personally and put it on a white list so you don't get banned when you login from a new location.
---
I always liked the cleft of shadows, in Orgrimmar, not only is it a sounds like a euphanism, but it even has a larger front entrance, and then a small little backdoor entrance.
---
Ah, that makes sense. For some reason I was thinking Gnomes only got +5 engineering.
---
So I take it Guidelime is something of a guide with data on how much xp each of the mobs and quests yields to sort of help predict when you'll level off of quest turn-ins and such, and not actually dynamically adjusting to what you're actually doing. Is that right?

**Who are we?**
---
We are currently 16 60s deep and we have all been pugging MC and Ony with various guilds throughout the last several weeks. We are planning to begin hosting our own MC and Ony PUGs by the November 19th reset. By December 3rd we aim to have a full roster requiring no PUGs and an official shift to a mixed Loot Council/DKP system.
---
**Raid Schedule**
---
We intend to raid Wednesday and Thursday nights from 9pm-12am server (EST) time. When BWL launches, a third night may be added on Tuesday or Monday. We will have a strict cut-off to our raid times unless everyone is in agreement to push one more boss/attempt. We are a guild of people with full time jobs and busy lives and while we take the game seriously (closer to hardcore than casual), we know we must respect our members’ real life realities.
---
**Roster Needs**
---
We are in need of every class and spec right now and recruiting all players level 55+. This means you do not have to be Ony attuned yet and we will help you power through it! There are many core raid spots available for the taking! This also opens us up to taking in any smaller guilds out there who want to stay together but are getting the itch to be part of a more organized raid team &amp; schedule.
---
Our raid leadership has extensive experience across the history of WoW in PvE and PvP but that doesn’t mean YOU are required to have extensive experience. We are looking for anybody who wants to experience end game content and the only requirement is that you hop in discord for raids, listen to directions and accept constructive criticism. Negativity and personal attacks are not tolerated in our groups and neither are sexist or racist jokes.
---
By the way – where all the Boomkins at?
---
Please feel free to contact any of the below players in-game to discuss joining, guild mergers or a weekday joint-guild raid! Thank you all for your time and good luck in Azeroth!
---
GM, Raid Assist – Freakytrip
---
Raid Leader – Fop
---
Officers – Harpoon, Margaux, Manualshift, Diabeaters, Tastycakes (Bashmore#1804)
---
My guild and I left Whitemane day two because we just couldn’t sit in those queues.
---
Best decision ever. All the hard cores who just HAD to be on the biggest servers because they had FOMO or actually thought the new servers would die, or didn’t have the leadership and coordination to move the guild, or foresight to plan in case queues happened, stayed. 
---
Smolderweb is the best server for chill players. It just doesn’t have the sweaty try hard feel that some of these other servers have. It feels more vanilla. There was less cleave/aoe groups tho they still happened. There’s less BiS or kick bs. MC is still being cleared just fine, but it didn’t happen week two. There’s plenty of great players, plenty of guilds, always dungeon runs going on. 
---
I can’t wait to see how the PvP goes. There are still tons of people leveling too. My buddy is just about to hit sixty in a few days. 
---
Anyway, kind of off topic. But just seeing all these elitist experiences elsewhere makes me even happier for our decision.

[Icy Veins](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/mage-dps-pve-gear-best-in-slot) has a guide with what gear is pre-BiS and how to get it. Just look at the list for dungeons and see which ones are within your level and start running them nonstop. You can do Arena in BRD to get the belt and some decent rings.

Reddit is a terrible place to discuss fury theorycrafting. The good discussion happens in https://discord.gg/nqKUFBk
---
As fury and playing optimally, almost all your hits are yellow hits or counted as such from queueing. On short bosses last raid I had one or two white hits only, as you have too much rage most of the time. 
---
Even if you’re playing poorly you still want 6 hit though.
---
You need the in-game add-on spy and wowhead gathering tool.  They talk to one another about all the players spotted on your realm.  I'm on my phone, if I remember I'll give you a screenshot of what I see.
---
Regarding /who, I can't give any more ways to show who is on your server.  Each method adds to my argument, no matter how well you think it is.
---
Grobbulus seems like so much fun
---
Hell, that's 7 figures then. 1-$ 2-1 3-0 4-, 5-0 6-0 7-0
---
I make 7 figures a year. 10 if you count the ".00"
---
Everyone hates people like that. Just cancel your sub man, noone wants you here. Clearly you want to play victim so just fuckin leave and tell yourself you were bullied out of it or whatever.
---
You gotta bind more keys my dude. It is a pain at the start but it is very much worth it.
---
Also, if you want to watch how to beat paladins monkeynews has a really good duel where he shows how important it is to kite them and use intercept and charge to do burst damage.
---
Heres the video.

U suck
---
The assumption for BoK is that it is based on the mana-cost for the ability (multiplied by x) right?, assuming that is the only component (no other variables) then you just simply compare the mana cost of the other abilities and do the same calculations.
---
Thanks for the reply. I have max bandages so that's good. I assumed I would use them for self healing in some fights to save mana
---
This is just my opinion (and a bit of a rant), so take it with a grain of salt.
---
* Leave the level cap alone - if developed properly we can kill Archimonde and Sargeras at L60.
---
* Expansions could introduce new mechanics or abilities rather than higher lvls.  I thought resilience, spell penetration, magic resistance, etc, were a great ideas.  Dungeon and raid mechanics could take advantage of this and more.  I think of M:TG - each expansion introducing a mechanic (sometimes broken), but most of the other cards don't lose value on the table and sometimes are reinvigorated.
---
* Perhaps we could focus on specialties to a finer degree rather than just talent spec.  Example: Improved curse of elements - sacrificing talent points to provide more overall raid dmg (and maybe include nature dmg) or no cap on talent point spending (see Diablo 2).
---
* Don't lock something behind a rep grind or raid.  People pay their $15/mo whether they log 200 hours or not at all, so don't exclude your casual player base from excitement because they don't have time for the mundane.
---
* For the love of god, get rid of LFG/LFR.  As soon as it was introduced in WLK I hated dealing with x-server pugs.  This allowed no personal accountability and led to a lot of frustration for 5m dungeons that were already difficult for casual players.
---
There are some great advancements to the retail game (like pali tanks, guild banks, and mobs at equal lvl).  However, their intention to bring quality of life also brought lazy players who can now faceroll their way to free stuff.
---
That's the problem I've heard about in pve servers, there's no recourse. You can't even stop them from joining your dungeon party later on.
---
With regards to people generating too much threat and aggroing mobs I think it would occur less if mobs would hit you harder. Maybe I'm not remembering correctly but I thought that if you pulled aggro in, for example, a BC heroic as a caster you'd get 1-2 shot.
---
Yes. Pre-hots
---
No I got it - you're sweaty.
---
If PvP is your main focus you should really have nature’s focus maxed instead of tranquil spirit.  You need your heals to resist pushback as much as possible or you will die.  10% mana reduction pales in comparison.
---
Also 30% reduced shapeshifting cost would be nice if you had a build that played toward feral... but you skipped furor which is a very important PvP talent.  You also only have one point in nature’s grasp and none in improved root so you will suffer against melee with this build.
---
All that said, you’re not wrong necessarily.  Your build maximizes wrath damage and has good dots with moonfire/insect swarm.  I would do a few things differently, but you know what’s right for you.
---
You can divine favour at any point and it last until you cast the shock, so the shock is absolutely free while you’re fighting.   
---
The decision between shock and BoSanc is a personal one, you could argue either way, but it’s all up to what the individual needs.
---
Thanks,  Maybe I’ll quest instead then.  Should I be bothering to do dungeons at all?  I know dungeon quests also give good exp but it does take time to find a group and travel there.
---
if you need the item(regardless of the reason) you hit need. if you don’t care you hit greed. Because as you said, “everybody can use pretty much all mats for something.” Its what the button is for.
---
It's a 5 minute cooldown. You cannot cast it while moving, and if you start the cast, then move, you still take the damage over time as if you were channeling it (You also start the cooldown). Channel is 4 seconds.
---
İf you dont mind my lack of informaton :) What is Pre-hots?
---
Presumably because they came in later they had better gear that shouldn't be available at this stage.
---
Nightfall contributes about 3.3% of total DPS for SM locks that DS locks don't get,  which makes up for most of the difference in DPS on its own.
---
There might be a bigger difference in later phases but for now the specs are very comparable.  If your Lock running SM/Ruin vs. DS/Ruin is the difference between success and failure on phase 1 content then your raid has much bigger problems, so people should play whichever one suits them better.
---
You get 0 honor for dying. Fighting on equal terms in a huge battle carries the risk of wasting your time because you lose, whereas hopping between 48-55 leveling zones is just straight up farming. It's the exact same reasoning behind premade dodging, it makes no sense to accept a real challenge with risk of loss instead of stomping the helpless.
---
Do they have gear rewards??? Hmm
---
Hotting yourself before pull for threat. Think he was kidding. No good enchants out yet
---
You aren't in the same argument as me.  I'm telling someone to stop whining that they aren't going to get to be bis before phase 2.  
---
It's literally been like 3 days now, I haven't kept track of what I said before.
---
Please put me on the list so I can be forced to get back to my real life.
---
I hate to say this, but as a shadow priest main, I basically agree. I'm sure that there are extremely skilled druids that can compete and even win, but the overwhelming majority its gonna be a very very rough uphill battle vs a Spriest. 
---
If its a 1v1 so far my ONLY outcomes vs druids have been
---
1) I kill the druid
---
2) Th druid "tries" to run away and then I kill them
---
But you can look it up... He is just refusing to do so. So burdening other people due to willful ignorance. I am not celebrating that.
---
I’ll be doing it, unless I burn out at 13 or my real life situation changes
---
Hopefully people agree to the brackets, already saw Lost Chapter saying they’d break
---
I think I’m going to go for 30/0/21 and just respec if it turns out I need more healing later down the road... hopefully it works OK lol
---
Damn right
---
I make some money on weird things, salt shakers are mentioned but truesilver transformers seem to sell well on my server for some reason
---
Thanks :)
---
I would say the same thing to those filthy Mograine allys always camping in Blackrock entrance from searing gorge
---
Not sure what you would call it but it’s not pvp.
---
It’s sh&amp;t behavior however you slice it.
---
NANI!?
---
Not only that, teaching is important for reinforcing the ideas and experiences you pick up. If you can explain something well, you more than likely have mastered the concept and are more likely to know the info in the future.
---
What is the dungeon path for 52? Just BRD then DM then everything else?
---
Do you need skinning in order to make the whelp farming profitable?
---
That's insane dedication man. Some people live off the government and play WoW all day. I heard about people like this were on private servers as well.
---
This person however built the foundation of his knowledge.
---
There is a difference if a person asks:
---
"Is Arcanite Reaper considered better than Obsidian Edged Blade due to the 5% crit in early PvP gear or is the extra weapon swing more valuable?" This person already informed himself and now an experienced warrior is more likely to share his knowledge from his ranking days or overall PvPing experience.
---
"What's the best PvP weapon?" will net the newbie a lot less answers, I'd wager.
---
Gnomish first, then Goblin, if you don't mind leveling it twice. Basically, you craft every Gnomish Engineering BoP that doesn't require Gnomish Engineering to use (ie.: everything but World Enlarger and Gadgetzan Teleporter), then drop Engineering and level it all up again and go Goblin.
---
If you must only pick one of the two, I'd go with Gnomish, but both have pros and cons.
---
What does that even mean?  That I live in a hot place?  It's freezing where I am, I have to wear like three layers all the time.
---
I literally played alliance twice as a hardcore raider from January-March 05 and then again May 06-Nov 06. I   also played horde from March 05-May 06 and again Nov 06+. I've seen every single raid from the point of progression in vanilla as both factions. From server first Lucifron kills all the way to Naxxramas on both factions. I was a paladin for my first time as alliance as well, when blessings were five minutes max. So I feel I can speak on this. You disagree, and that's fine. But I'm speaking off experience, not bias.
---
Because it is not bias when I tell you, alliance have it easier than horde because of paladins. This doesn't mean horde raiding now is hard, it isn't. It's all a joke right now. But Salvation alone is nuts. One friggin paladin being able to give that buff to an entire raid does not compare to one shaman being able to give windfury to 4 other people, or tranquil totem. 
---
&gt;And you got a Horde tag. Not biased. Sure
---
So if I didn't have a tag it would be legit? Its just flair my man.
---
I ambush crit level 60 mages for 1800 to 2k unbuffed with perdition's MH and CHT offhand. Time it right I can get a backstab crit 1 GCD later for like 1.2.
---
WHAT
---
I usually try /wait /beckon /wait, but I think adding a hug in might be a good idea lol
---
Says the person unable to respond with an argument. You lost this one, dude, big time.
---
I did a UD strat with this hunter with a 57 pet who masterfully weaved the pet in and out as patrols ran by, and dismissed him when we were getting too close to packs (we were all 60 so we could skip a bit). He didn't mess anything up. It was beautiful.
---
I complimented him on his pet control and his response was "yeah, low level pet, want to make sure I don't mess anything up".
---
What a guy.
---
You cast regrowth then rejuvenate on yourself, then bear form and attack.
---
The healing you do to yourself from the hots cause you to gain threat on everything without using global cooldowns or rage while fighting.
---
you are a true hero of azeroth, all multiboxers must die
---
You need to kill 5,085 more mobs to get to level 60, so that's 635 mobs per day. If you do nothing except kill 2 mobs per minute, you need to play for 5 hours and 20 minutes per day.
---
Blizzard costs half my mana at 21. Tbf, I'm not gimped out like the alt I am. Mostly some greens.
---
A lot of these replies are garbage. Imagine getting upset because people prefer asking questions in a game based on social interaction...Why do people play MMOs then act like the social players are the weirdos? &gt;&lt;
---
Even as a Vanilla veteran the player base is much too hung up on BiS and min-max. They can't relax and just play the game, or let others do so either it seems, everything has to be by the book. The player base of Classic has definitely minimized my enthusiasm for the game.
---
If anyone knows of a server with a significant casual-minded community let me know. I prefer Horde but anything to get away from the hardcore mentality.
---
[u/IodinUraniumNobelium](https://www.reddit.com/user/IodinUraniumNobelium/) You can ask me questions anytime you like. I may not have the answer but I'll at least give it a shot...
---
I'm a paladin.
---
piss off you jerk anyone who multiboxes in this game is being a real jerk, if your underleveled then level faster.
---
Thinking of doing the 30 in balance but maybe I should put the 3 points from that natural shapeshifter tier into  improved roots? Not sure which would be better for me at that level to be completely honest... 
---
As far as Nature’s focus, I thought about it but I still want to be able to PvE heal well as I won’t JUST be doing PvP so I felt like the mana reduction was more important overall. Now I’m double thinking it all over again lol
---
[lvl60warrior]: LFM Tank BRD Arena/Anger spam, HoJ and savage glad chain reserved!
---
*repeats spam for 2 hours*
---
I've tanked an instance here and there on my shaman. If the group plays vanilla style, the biggest issue is mana. You have to drink after every pull.
---
But SP do melt faces tho
---
I did it in Vanilla and it took a massive toll on my health so no, I won't be doing it again, at this age it would probably kill me lol.
---
Dont get me wrong, mad respect to those who reach R14, however in my case, i think im gonna choose cutting my own toes off with a rusty spoon before "Im gonna grind R14".
---
Makes sense, I guess it's best to go gnomish for now at least and if I feel like I'm missing out on goblin stuff just relevel it. My other profession is mining so it's not like it'd be hard to grind the mats again.
---
Same
---
The blue set as a HotW/NS Druid is beautiful my itemized for that actual hybrid do anything on the fly kind of play style
---
Thanks for the information!
---
After this blizzcon my sympathy for the devs went way up. The problems they’re trying to solve are basically for people who play the game for a living. People with audiences. I don’t like or agree with every aspect of the game but all of their work is stripped down to the bare math and everything else is left by the wayside. The sense of discovery we had was crushed by data and data mining.
---
No changes
---
I dislike PvP to begin with, but months of nolifing to go from 10 to 14? LOLNOPE. 
---
I'll try and get to 7 for the boots, and that's it.
---
For a small fee of course.
---
I never did the rank 14 grind, but I'd pay with a guild my server who had many do it.  Not a single goddamned one of them enjoyed it.  They did it.  They go so far in they didn't want to stop, but none of the ones I played with felt they ultimately enjoyed it.  They didn't think it necessarily made them better, or showed they were better.  It was a virtually unanimous "I wish I'd rather done anything else".
---
They would play 14-16 hours a day, doing nothing but spamming BGs.  When they did sleep they would wake up again and start it up again.  Even when they were done they couldn't just quit.  They would crash for about a week, but then get back into a less burdensome cycle of still pvping to help those who had helped them.  They all hated what it did to them.  They didn't just burn out on pvp, seveal of them quit the game entirely for a month or more.
---
I really wish they weren't bringing back this pvp system.  It was simply unhealthy for those who went hard into it.  It is a system that rewards time played harder than being good.  It rewards just raw grinding to the point of being dangerous to your health, and it only gets worse the bigger the server.  People can bitch about #nochanges all they want, but it's downright cruel to inflict that pvp system onto people again.  People are going to do it and it's going to fuck them up physically, just like it did before.  At one point one of the guys I played with was on for something like 28 hours straight and a GM contacted him to see if they were account sharing.  He wasn't, he just wasn't sleeping because someone else was trying to break their system to setting r14s and if he stopped everything would be fucked up.
---
It's a terrible system and it should never be brought back.
---
Just had an argument with a guy in my guild when he said anyone who says the community is great and alive in classic is just rose tinted glasses. Since that's just flat out false I tried to figure out how he thought that. Turns out if there's not something he can do that directly increases his power on his character then he's not going to do it so he's not going to go out into the world or interact with people..... Just left me head-scratching. It's such a stupid viewpoint to say "I refuse to do any of these things therefore game is dead with nothing to do".
---
I don't enoy the thing, so nobody else should enjoy it either!
---
&gt; The diminishing returns on honor offset by a timer (dont kill the same person for 10 or 15 minutes),
---
I thought the timer was *much* longer than that, like hours at least.
---
&gt;Or used Light fall.
---
The spell is called Feather Fall. Get it right.
---
I don't wanna hear about how my fury spec is inferior to Arms for leveling.
---
Fortunately if that ever comes out, I just pull an extra pack, and their protestations come out as
---
"yeah but you get tactiwwwas1211444444444444444444"
---
Runecloth isn't worth more on the AH? I always see people trying to buy it
---
Rattlegore has been great
---
Wish I had you as a tank when I was healing in panda land there were times I was on and all mana regen abilities were on cd and the tank was all get good as he pulled another room of mobs while I was trying to drink to get mana and let’s not even get started about me having the audacity to even loot mobs could barely do that and sometimes I was leaving entire rooms unlooted
---
Tbf in our previous duels he fucked me, healed in bubble and 100-0'd me in full stun another. He thought his HoW would have killed me but luckily it missed :)
---
And IIRC you can't lower it past 5% with +hit.
---
It works 100% of the time 30% of the time
---
\&gt;  The wave of new players who have yet to reach 60 will become a new community in WoW, a completely different playerbase who don't have expectations of 1 hour runs in Molten Core and will enjoy the new raid (because to many, including myself, MC is a new raid). 
---
A playerbase that will be significantly smaller than the people who have BWL on farm. While what you're saying is true the reality is most people not 60 yet, will never hit 60. It'll be much harder to find pug raids. While the content will of course still be there and maybe viable, the people interested in still doing that content most likely wont.
---
I....just couldn't watch anymore.....it was physically impossible.
---
It was one of the most rewarding moments of classic so far :P
---
You're entitled to your opinion but personally I prefer vanilla pvp without resilience, and I'm sure that plenty of other classic wow players feel the same way.
---
TBC is TBC and classic is classic, and lots of people prefer classix.
---
My server has a rogue in Tanaris who has stalked Gadgetzan for so long he's synced with the guard patrolling patterns so he can gank in specific spots at specific times and not aggro gaurds at all despite being in the middle of town. This is without any incentive whatsoever, just for the sport of the kill. There's no doubt that relentless camping will occur when there's actually something to be gained from doing it, besides the obvious grief.
---
Having said that I still think it's hyperbolic to assume leveling will be impossible. If nothing else, you'll just need to ask world/LFG if there's any camping going on in the zone you want to go to and adapt appropriately if the response is yes. As usual it's just these "content creators" making mountains out of mid-sized regular hills because no one would want to watch a guide on "how to take a chill pill and patiently accept that other players can affect your gameplay experience, for better or worse"
---
Lol this would totally be aimed shot for hunters!
---
Yeah I’m 34 and doing the tusks by myself (it suuuuucks). Will hit up my guild tonight for a quick cyclonian  kill. That ace is gonna be MASSIVE for me. I think it’s almost double the weapon dps and it’s low end dmg is higher than the top end of the staff.
---
You do dogshit dps as drain tank its pathetic and near uselessness in a group, do not go that spec in dungeons
---
As a feral tank, I don't even bother tanking skull anymore, and just focus on X +others. The dps generally kills skull so quickly I don't even have time to build aggro on it, and am better off generating aggro on the other mobs. Just place skull on the squishiest hard hitter, and ignore it during the fight. The melee can take the 3 hits it'll do before it explodes, and you'll have solid threat on the rest of the mobs.
---
this
---
This is the big thing that draws me away from PvE. I hate the RNG!
---
Unless you enjoy the pvp
---
Hi, /u/Shogglez

---
I use the simple dynamite all the time as a tank. The one that takes blasting powder and runecloth. It's got no stun but 400aoe dmg gathers a fuckton of aggro on large pulls, and has saved me many wipes.
---
How is th is dude playing 40 toons affect you personally ? Let us know your struggle
---
I liked it. Not my favorite but still a pretty good one
---
Obviously it is not an exact replica. But you cannot deny the similarities.
---
I'd argue that fighting for tags was much worse. The starting zones werent even that bad. But when i reached around level 45 damn those zones feel like they were designed for very few people at the same time. Many mobs you had to kill only spawned in small areas and only like 10 of them and with realtively long respawn timers. Like caves and stuff. There is a cave in feralas where you need  to kill yetis and there are a maximum of 15 of them total and you need 10 itams i think, not just kill, getting the items that didnt have 100% drop rate. There were around 10 people doing the quest when i arrived and it was hard to get a tag. Most people just started camping one single spawn. And there was always new people arriving. It was frustratinh. Badlands was also especially bad. 
---
Getting killed on the other hand idk. Was never a big deal to me. I cant comprehend how people say that they get camped for hours. How is that even possible? If someone is corpse camping me i just ress at the graveyard, go afk for 10mins and then they are either not there anymore or i go myself somewhere else, even to a different continent if i have to.
---
There was no struggle, he died easily.
---
will weird keys fit like the key to the outhouse in searing gorge?
---
Net is gnome and charge helmet is goblin right? Doesn't make this any easier haha
---
No.  If this was a post complaining about people exploiting terrain or having a cross faction coalition or something otherwise against the rules or not intended as part of the game, I would totally agree.
---
This is a post being shitty just to be shitty.  Minor gatekeeping on what a “cool” way to play warcraft vs what is “pathetic”  Maybe they do it the purposely hinder the progress of the opposite faction.  Maybe they do it 100% to get targetted in salty reddit posts.  Doesn’t matter, its part of the game and how they prefer to experience it.  
---
A kindergartner would understand that pvp in all its forms would occur on a pvp server.
---
Honestly warlocks have plenty of ways to control their threat (assuming nonshit tank) that it's not that big an issue. Distributing max damage without pulling threat is the fun part of mc for me.
---
Single Target fights are annoying though, and ony is just stupid
---
No problem brotha
---
Don't be silly. You can only be a corpse for 6 minutes, you'll be watching as a ghost.
---
Fasion?  Stay in school, kids.
---
REP THE HORDE. Who cares about the complaints. Get good.
---
I would love it if they didn’t give dishonorable kills against npcs in major cities
---
What are hunters putting on their one handers or two handers?
---
Back to retail with you little coomer.
---
The 10% when you aren't is a pserver thing. I went on vacation in the summer of 2006 for 2 weeks and dropped from 3% off rank 9 to like 5 or 6.
---
Fair enough man. I'm sure some of these people are way over exaggerating. In vanilla the differences were larger than they are now too. Now we just dominate everything regardless of what we have. It's why I said above I wouldn't trade windfury for any of it. Just because as a warrior, I find windfury to be so damn fun. Even if it causes me to get aggro and die at times. I always felt sad that Blizzard took Windfury totem out of WoW.
---
I want to learn what type of damage ALL monsters do in classic (physical, fire, etc..) so I could equip gear accordingly.  Where should i go?
---
Pretty much every dps class can deal with non-elites:
---
Warriors - Just face tank them
---
Rogues - Stun lock
---
Paladins - Face Tank
---
Mages - Lol, win button
---
Locks - kite or if it's a big issue they can pull out voidwalker
---
druid - healing druid isn't going to pull meaningful aggro, feral dps can tank/stun them, moonkin isn't going to pull aggro
---
shamans - Never dealt with an enhance shaman, but probably earthbind totem will do fine
---
Priest - bubble/MC
---
You're exactly right, Blizzard has been wasting potential left and right. Don't take this personally but I'm passionate about this and am gonna offer valid and plausible story directions that sadly weren't taken for basically every xpac since Cata.
---
First off, you don't even need a bad guy for conflict. In BFA, we could've actually seen a war play out between the Horde and Alliance. Why stop at Teldrassil and Undercity? Move some little towns around, revamp the world, see how the two great powers duke eachother out, THEN see how the old enemies we've beaten into submission before start to cooperate to form a credible threat. Azshara; *she* should have gotten the power level Sylvanas now has. Sylvanas is a grief-stricken ranger general, Azshara is a queen-sorceress used to dealing with extra-planar business and in fact had her eye on Northrend during WotLK. Can you imagine *her* going up against Bolvar? The sea, storm and the arcane against death, fire and ice. I'm sure she'd melt the ice, bend the citadel's metal and send the throne keeling over into the icy wastelands. It'd be biblical.  
---
But let's wind back to before BFA. From Legion onwards, the Nightmare could've taken root in Teldrassil and converted it into a corrupted raid that'd force the night elves THEMSELVES to have to come to terms with the flawed way in which Teldrassil even originated; as an unapproved attempt to regain their immortality. Teldrassil was a time bomb and from a story perspective Sylvanas blocked the Night Elves from ever having to reflect on their own people's actions, preventing their internal conflict. Resolving that had almost boundless philosophical subtext potential; questions about morality, immortality, the price we pay and the lengths we're willing to go, etc.. 
---
The Worgen and Night Elves could've approached the Dragonflight about where they could find a new home. I can imagine the Draenei and their island scrapyard wouldn't mind joining or helping. Taking a lesson from Desolace's 10-year plan recovery, we could've set our sights on Sargeras' sword and tried to use the power of Azerite to not only remove the sword but heal the wound, create a new Well of Eternity and turn (parts of) Tanaris/Silithus into a new lush zone by idk helping Magni hack the Origination engine or whatever, taking lessons from the Nightborne as well. We've learned a ton about Maraudon, Sholazar and Deepholme yet filed it all away in a dusty cabinet. Wielding such power (responsibly) to reshape the world could also raise political questions and be the Alliance's diametrically opposed answer to the manabomb; healing over destroying.
---
But hey, *before* that, from Warlords onward, I suppose the Legion had to strike sooner or later but we could've actually joined forces with a different planet that was threatened by the Legion and introduced a whole slew of new races and continents. Doing that now would feel weird; the Legion is defeated. 
---
Also, with the Imperium subjugated by the Iron Horde, and Thrall defeating their leader in Mak'gora, and sights set on further exploring this lost homeworld beyond the sea, it would've been the perfect time to introduce the Ogres as a playable race. The Arakkoa being no friends to the orcs and perhaps having an interest in stopping them, they might've joined the Alliance as a playable race. The Fields of Farahlon, was hyped up but cancelled in favor of a rush job.
---
Before that, from Mists onwards, we could've finally gone after Magatha for poisoning Garrosh' axe. Cairne was well respected by most members of the Horde and acted as a counterweight to Garrosh' aggression. Assassinating him accelerated the events that led to the Siege of Orgrimmar; Magatha was guilty and to this day deserves to die. Have *her* finally become a raid boss instead of the Timeless Isle which nobody cared about and was just a way to ease us into jumping the shark with time-travel.
---
But, from Cata onwards, Gilneas could've been worked out further and be introduced as a high level, post-apocalyptic blight ridden zone where you need to clean up the mess, find survivors and drive out the Forsaken.
---
The Council of Three Hammers still has plenty of unresolved conflict; a conflict between various dwarven factions wouldn't be unprecedented.
---
We could've seen Gallywix finally have a villain arc that could've ended in an actual original way - by bankrupting him and acquiring all his assets in the name of the Horde, placed under new, trusty (for Goblin standards) leadership.
---
From Wrath of the Lich king onwards, instead of a Cataclysm, they could've actually worked on Sylvanas' story and seen where it led - the Shadowlands would have made sense then, not now.
---
Tichondrius was underplayed. Operation Gnomeregan was a bait and switch. Alterac, the Twilight Highlands and Arathi are in limbo. I suppose Grim Batol is just gathering cobwebs instead of being an incredibly valuable fortress that could host Earthen and Dark Iron allies to put pressure on Gilneas and Undercity.
---
Except for Wrathion, the Dragonflights are doing who knows what; I guess they aren't that entrepeneuring anymore, instead having long given up and lining up to auditions for the next villain every expansion; none of them's felt like allying with either of the two great powers of the world even though we saved their butts a dozen times, see Dragonblight and the Nightmare.
---
Instead of any of these things both factions keep repeating the same dance; conflict is instigated, then blamed on a tertiary party, then they have to team up, but the underlying reasons are forgotten and new conflict erupts. It's like all the faction leaders have ADD and it's up to the guards and spread out NPCs to make witty remarks about the state of the world, while faction leaders speak like a bunch of middle school mandatory play actors.
---
It wasn't always like this, mind you. But at this stage the damage has already been done. Best advice I can give them now at this point is to hire a small team of hard working writers with that special glint in their eyes, give 'em a fair budget and tell them to knock it out of the park with a new stunning IP. It happened with Overwatch, which is doing pretty good, so.
---
79 days though, not quite three months but close.
---
Do a after p2 clip aswell ^^
---
Same but at 8 we even do split raids our guild has none. I did get our only nem legs though :)
---
Yep. The no changes crowd fail to realize these things would have likely been changed in classic if the populations were anything near what they are now.  
---
When the size of the server triples, that's already a massive change, and refusing to adjust accordingly because a vocal group of stubborn players is dumb.
---
no, fuck off.  ony head intrigue is an interesting part of the game
---
Dragons have a cloaca
---
Do instance farming man. It's very fast.
---
Shut up
---
“Ambus-“ god damn I felt the cringe in my spine
---
I still haven’t reached lvl 60 haha. My pace dropped a shit ton after a few weeks into launch :(.  I’m at lvl 52 I think. Gonna start up again after I get back into the states.
---
It's already happening.  
---
There's 10+ Hordies camping every exit from neutral towns like Everlook, Booty Bay and Gadgetzan.  
---
I literally need to corpse-hop from Everlook FP to the city.  
---
Bit tougher? Ha, you can't level past 30 - STV is a massacre, in Blasted Lands and Searing Gouge bored 60 from Kargath is corsecamping nonstop.  
---
So you mean that with P2 it would be better?)
---
&gt; Are you doing spellcleave groups or straight up instance grinding?
---
I agree that would be nice
---
Any horde with a little gumption can do gnomer, that's easy. 
---
Ask me about my lvl 30 horde stockades group lol.
---
I see nothing wrong there
---
Kick your warlocks, they are trash.
---
I can pull agro on command on anyone other than our guild main thanks who usually dual wield.
---
Hey Gonebald, I remember your first server event. You're good at this; keep up the good work. I miss Grobbulus.
---
I mean, every dungeon I have been to since SM involves corpse hopping. I can't imagine this is any different.
---
It will kill/item count as you work through the quests. It shows quests you've picked up/turned in and adjust on the fly.  
---
It show you where to go on your map for the mobs. I don't think I would have gotten even halfway with out it.  
---
As a first timer who got distracted alot I still got to 60 in 13.5 days played purely through questing. I ventured into one dungeon twice.
---
Get a well geared bear druid.  Watch them kill themselves by hitting the druid.
---
Lots of flight paths will definitely be camped.
---
I just hit 48, and I feel like I’ve been playing the game way too much. Still loving it. Gonna be rough as a resto shammy in the wild
---
Are you man enough to admit you’re still wrong?
---
Yeah, we can.
---
I mean...level 60 guildies have an incentive to come help and there is just one layer so it's going to be much better than it was when just the psycopaths are running camping people.
---
It's not some irrational fear though.  Any server with 60/40 imbalance or greater is *actually* going to bleed out nearly the entirety of their underpopulated faction.  Only the maybe two or three actually balanced servers will remain as actual PvP servers.  The rest will become PvE servers in all but name.  Luckily I'm on one of those two or three but the number of people we're going to lose is bad for Classic overall even I'll be relatively insulated from it personally.
---
Keep killing them whenever they come and attack you. If they beat you most of the time, transfer to a different zone. If you keep winning then keep doing what you're doing.
---
Yeah mostly kidding. No chance is healing power worth it, but technically it would be best.
---
I hear that the talent makes it unresistsble. Also I've watched Hunter streamers and they usually have contingency plans if a feign death works but somehow the mobs come right to him even though he's off their aggro table.
---
you allow 1 in each, not a ton of them
---
and as you said, you need to be damned good to pull it off, like ret, enh, ele, boomy or feral dps. 
---
if your raid is 4-5 hunters, 4-5 spriest, 4-5 boomies, 4-5 ret pal / dps sham, etc. then you can claim that your raid lets these kinds of classes in and have no issues.
---
Yeah that makes it tough then. Mob grinding isn’t all that bad with double xp. Just gotta find the right spots. What class are you?
---
Int for lack of a better option.

I like the player interaction you gain through the LFG/Trade spam.
---
It's a great way to get to know people, and potentially start up friendships compared to just being plopped in the same group together.
---
The only change I'd accept is if they added in a menu that showed the people who were looking for a group and for what dungeons. Addons can already do this, but relies on everyone having the addon. I don't want any auto-invite.
---
Yeah you're right haha. I was just thinking about the first KT kill and mixed it up with the rest of Naxx
---
You want to go fury talents early on to get that juicy extra crit, then once you’re 40 you respec arms for the bottom skill of arms tree... as for DW vs 2h I prefer a 2h because it’s more threat generated by your heroic strike at lower level, but I’d dual wield if it’s better dps. Purely my opinion:)
---
Why do some people say 9% in pve? I always thought it was 8%.
---
Not wiping on gar 5 times really speeds things up. Wish my pugs knew that
---
I’m just happy to see us mentioned. Feels like I never hear about Windseeker on Reddit. But I find it to be a really good server with solid populations and good people on both sides.
---
not trying to discredit your experience on smolderweb, but if you switched on day two which realms are you comparing your experience to?
---
My gf and I are doing something similar (warrior/priest). When we did the first dungeon (Ragefire Chasm), there was another warrior, and I think the other warrior sort of took over. For Wailing Caverns, we actually walked in just the two of us, and ended up deciding just to continue that way, to see how far we could get. Tank and healer can do pretty well on their own honestly, and we like the challenge, and it's a better environment to learn in. I also have a warrior alt., and when I tanked, when my gf wasn't playing, arguably being slightly noobish myself, the hunter in my group got pretty heated about the way I was doing it. I don't really want to subject my gf to anything like that, but honestly I think she'd simply completely ignore the other people.  I would recommend going in as just 2 or just have a real life friend as a third. That way you don't have to try to learn while there is a group of people waiting for you and pushing you.
---
When you or your partner do look for a group, when people join, you can tell them you're new at it at the beginning, so they can decide at that point to leave if they are looking for a speedrun. 
---
As far as feeling lost, I think the simplest way to get started is. 1) Throw something to pull. Then run and stand behind a rock or a wall, this will cause the ranged attacking enemies to come forward, making it less likely for more enemies to join in. 2) Use sunder armor a lot. Prioritize any enemies that turn to attack the healer. Everything after that can be considered bonus improvements - obviously you should add using Bloodrage, Battle Shout and Demoralizing Shout to this.  Taunt and mocking blow help get the enemies back attacking you, which is what you want. The healer is much less effective if he has to heal himself.  If you're doing all that, then you're not lost. I don't believe in pulling more enemies than necessary. I think it's common for DPSes to get impatient, since they want to do as much damage as fast as they can.  Also, I think many of them don't realize how much a warrior has to wait for rage. 
---
In a group, I believe your primary role is just to protect the healer. It's often impossible to prevent the enemies from attacking the DPS people, and that is just a secondary goal. They usually have means to protect themselves.
---
I think nowadays people expect bigger pulls and for the tank to try to hold threat on to many enemies while the DPS classes attack them all at once with area of effect abilities.  I don't think the tank manages to hold threat on everything. This might be the sort of thing that person was expecting. But that is optional and not the way to do it as a beginner. 
---
It sounds like you were doing just fine, doing the pulls, etc. I think with more experience, (maybe without a bunch of yahoos in the group,) you will feel less lost and I think will probably speed up a little bit indirectly. When I started tanking, even after knowing the game and other classes, I also got complaints in wailing caverns, and I'm sure you did fine. It can be a thankless job, being the tank.
---
&gt; Granted, I'm a warlock, 
---
Druid vs warlock is unwinnable for Druid) There's nothing you could do vs fear. Even if I open up from stealth and kill him - he soulstone res, fear, dots ... I'm dead somewhere far away.
---
p3 January/February would make a lot of sense. Five to Six months is plenty of time for anyone even somewhat playing the game regularly to hit 60 and get through MC a fair few times.  This notion that "anyone 60 doesn't have a job" is just so laughably wrong it's not even cute or funny anymore, because it's just such a commonly held belief among a small but loud minority lol.
---
Raiding isn't supposed to go the speed of someone who spends a couple hours a week playing would go at.
---
Doing the math for a decently smell the roses time to 60 of 10d played, playing an hour and a half a day would be more than enough to be 60 for a late jan/early feb BWL release. Now take half that for a "I want to hit 60 and raid" time that's fairly decent and you see that it's not that unreasonable for someone with a job spending a couple hours a day on their hobby is hitting 60 and raiding long before the other group.  This sub just has a small loud minority that's mad they can't spend as much time as they'd like on a hobby it seems. v0v  Sucks for them, but it's no reason to hold back a huge portion of the playerbase who are invested in the game.
---
I kind of have the same problem on and off. I get half second freezes every once in awhile
---
or you could all need, and wouldn't have to worry about it?
---
what server do you play on? do you sell loot to people, if so what are your prices going for the ring and rod usually?
---
Holy shit, i feel your pain as a Prot Paladin.  I always get "wtf why is healer always oom.  Tank sucks".  Reality is, all you dps asshats don't know how to properly do your job in a non-faceroll setting.  Attack my target, my incidentals hold aggro on everything else, then i'm not going OOM trying to judge the shit off of you, etc.
---
No I do not sorry bro, I’m not a fan of streaming I just prefer releasing videos. I’m sure you know of Cdew though, he’s a great player and seems like a pretty cool guy, if you have questions then the shaman discord is full of knowledge
---
Wbuffs are fun and cd should be eliminated. CMV
---
Maybe you should have been a higher level
---
What day/time do you think is peak dungeon running time? My guess is weekends at 7? And whats your go to intro chat message when looking for an invite. Do you just go "60 rogue dps" or do you got a more stylish or snazzy opener. Rogue dungeon ques are between 45 mins to an hour and a half each so anything to speed it up is timesaving. what I wouldnt do for a dungeon finder to not read lfg for hours on end
---
Did you figure it out?
---
"Make things easier for me even though it's already super easy"
---
Basically this is why retail is cancer.
---
I still log on to my Whitemane toon once in a while, I’ll get him to sixty eventually. 
---
So just exploring the LFG there and city chat as well as reading about people’s experiences here and on the forums.
---
You need to get the Theramore flightpath.
---
? Is this a meme? I clear MC in 55 minutes. Your average guild clears it in two hours. It's about performance and this helps decide who earns loot and who doesn't.
---
Its a long fucking grind. My ex did it, and 2 other guildies did it. I wish it upon no one. Missing one day meant that someone else crept up in your place.
---
With a full time job, I was able to hit rank 11 (which was my target, and I didn't plan on going past that, so I don't know if its even feasible for higher than that with a full time job).
---
That being said, I will totally try again, because Commander is the best fucking title in game. (and you know, mounts.)
---
Zul'Farrak
---
Questie is what you are looking for
---
Just level in instances. There will be an influx of groups looking to do the same.
---
MC is cleaveheaven. Any decent guild will just pull gehennas, sulfuron, domo adds together in the boss encounters and cleave them down. 
---
If you can get an AR as orc, OEB for any race, Spinal for orc again (Spinal is about as good as OEB in PvE) or BRE for any race, then your cleave damage that is 90% of MC will go through the roof.
---
Money in copper = XP * 6 
---
So in your case, 6000 * 6 = 36,000c 3g60s
---
Remember, you only get the gold that comes from the experience on max level, so if this quest also yields 1g for example, it won’t add up to 4g60s.
---
Talk to an innkeeper and you will find ...
---
Isn't that all based on who is playing?
---
I've played both pvp and pve. I prefer pve overall.
---
But, that's because I dislike pvp in wow in general. I don't care for the mechanics or gameplay style for a pvp. Just not my thing. I honestly enjoy playing with others, dungeons and raiding.
---
But I wouldn't go out calling something you enjoy as boring.  Washing my car is boring. Paying my bills is boring.
---
Unless the tank moves back mid-heal putting you within 10yards.
---
And also, I was just explaining the bug (drinking multiple times during combat)
---
Its only ever happened while at max range.
---
Those owls are the real winners.
---
&gt; I like the player interaction you gain through the LFG/Trade spam.
---
I've never had any meaningful interactions, and I've done hundreds of dungeons.
---
This guy does not tank.
---
Hey, So i have a rogue right now, its lvl 37 and im semi enjoying it, i do feel like the energy ussage is bad and im like out of energy 70% of the time, i like playing as a rogue but how is the life as 60? Is it boring or is it fun? And for warriors, i’ve got a lvl 11 warrior and maybe want to make it my main. Sometimes when i see it it looks really fun but then someone reminds me its really reliable on other people and they get kited so easily etc. I just want to have fun and not keep switching between my accounts, any1 that had a 60 rogue or warrior that can tell me how the life is af 60? And or if the leveling experience was great. Thanks!
---
The LFD tool was the single biggest thing that killed the community and sent the game down the path that lead to retail's current state.
---
No. Hell no.
---
They can also backfire and get you killed as a result of said backfire.
---

---
Killing people that you get the jump on is never the hard part, the hard part is being able to fight back (and win) if you get jumped in the first place.
---
I think a lot of people were surprised at the time to to find level 62 greens smashed their epics. Of course better gear was gonna be avail - but it was like the difference between inflation and Germany 1923.
---
Why? I just hit 48 this weekend
---
I think that says more about you than it does about the system.
---
I've had really good interactions with players this way, and a bunch of them have added me as friends and vice versa.
---
You didn't do 1.5 av did you? Rushing was near impossible because all it took was 4-5 mages to totally shut you down with the sheer amount of elite guards that existed.
---
Running across the bridge or up the ramp in zerg while a couple of mages cast blizzard pretty much wiped you, 1.12 and retail AV are literal jokes compared to AV in its prime. Sure maybe 20~ people will get by the mages, but then they respawn and have an army of guards to stall you for days while your team caps towers and gy's and pushes you all the way back to your base.
---
true lol, i do feel like most of the people freaking out are people that followed their friends to pvp servers or people that just like to complain tbh.  most of the people i play with are very excited for p2, it’s going to be a beautiful shit-show
---
You don’t have to kill the guards. You often have more than one tank in a raid. Assign the extras to picking up anything but the boss and pull them away from healers, away from the boss (to prevent the temptation to aoe). They’ll survive and keep civilians alive while you. Ike the boss then leave.
---
If you zerg with no plan like a bunch of animals, then that’s on y’all for incidental DHKs that occur.
---
RNG is a helluva thing, this week we had our fifth mageblade
---
I rather doubt they'll do that.
---
Would you mind telling me the name of the guide you used? I think I tried Guidelime's basic guide but it didn't seem to work and I got frustrated trying to sort it all out and wound up uninstalling it.
---
Why would you say that DW would pull ahead if only a couple boss fights are actually single target such as Magmadar and Ragnaros when in the rest of the dungeon 2-5 mobs gets pulled together and cleaved down where 2hand surpasses 1hand greatly?
---
I also have this problem
---
I did something similar to my cousin on his mage. I added '/s I'm gay' to his CD macro and on the first boss we were killing with our guild that week, he popped that macro and spammed it in /say.
---
Our guild immediately started laughing and created a joke in the guild saying we support him. Our guild still brings this up to him to this day
---
So are you saying if i get a healing power enchant and pre-hot myself before combat, my threat generation will be much higher?
---
Bro thats exactly my problem. Its killing me so many times
---
The better way is: 
---
&gt; Type `/afk off` to continue participating in the battleground.
---
lol, alrighty then?
---
Ahh roger that -- raid heals is another beast entirely. In pvp settings you'll rarely get an opportunity to cast a full healing wave, and additionally in raids (without being full resto) you likely won't be tank healing so no reason to get ancestral healing. You'll more than likely be throwing out chain heals. Not an expert by any means so please correct me if you have objections
---
Yep...and god forbid you take a week off.
---
Bre / annihalator?  Not sure what current armor values are.
---
&gt; Some of us are lackadaisical about performing and finishing quests; 
---
This is what I have a problem with. You give low effort and eventually when you need to group with others for elite/group/dungeon quests, you can't be bothered to know your role and contribute meaningfully to the group. No one owes you anything, and with your entitled attitude, even less.
---
N o  c h a n g e s
---
Get an authenticator and you can travel and play as much as you want. You don’t need a VPN.
---
I have them equipped
---
but you totally can do strat/scholo fine at 58. So long as you aren't a dps warrior
---
If you're really wanting the buff for a speed run: since most guilds raid in the evening, 6 hours before your raid time there's a good chance there won't be a head up. Turn in one head at that time and be ready exactly 6 hours later with your raid and turn another head in as soon as the CD ends.
---
whoever designed this map was lazy and smart
---
And this is why Blizzard is fighting with all this census addons.
---
\&gt;  t's a great way to get to know people, and potentially start up  friendships compared to just being plopped in the same group together. 
---
Bullshit.... The System doesn't involve anymore than someone spamming LFM X, and other people messaging you saying they will go do X.
---
Really because I haven’t been this excited for an expansion since wotlk

Checks out
---
What you are talking about is the lfg finder from TBC. All it did was allow you to put your name on a list for the dungeons you were interested in. It didn’t auto group or teleport. It was just a list to see what rolls people were so you could invite to your group.
---
Not against warriors though.  Or hunters.  I have so much trouble.
---
Got some elemental shaman footage for you:

2H fury is only viable for horde
---
Saw dem a couple of times
---
I have almost capped my mage and am levelling a Shaman alt, I'd throw my hat in the ring and say Shammy, decent damage, tanky and can heal - it is also a very fun class so if your friend did bail you could still level and have fun by yourself
---
It does sound like a pretty good time though lul.  I'm not really into it for the honor grind, but I'm definitely down for the hotspots that will be blowing up and just going in for some good old rowdy fun.
---
The problem with them is that they honestly sucked.
---
EPL; meant to encourage group PvP, but the objectives are so spread out and in farflung places like Plaguewood that you spend more time running than fighting.
---
Silithus; meant to encourage solo PvP, problem is the very design of Silithyst. It spawns in random sporadic places, which means you have no idea of where to go to fight other than camping eachothers bases, not very encouraging for actually going out to get silithyst.
---
I honestly wouldnt mind if they were excluded completely, they really just feel like they were implemented to test out world pvp objectives for BC, which i think after they failed in 1.12, they deemphasized in BC.
---
He puts out nothing but click bait and then deletes videos if people don’t like them enough.

...I have 3 art projects, 2 essays, and a midterm this week...and what did I do this morning? Spent 2 1/2 hrs doing this exact thing 😭
---
Not gonna lie, didn't read the whole thing, but I believe we agree in general.
---
Maybe don't remove it entirely but put it on a shorter cooldown?
---
wow, how can i be this unlucky.
---
What level does your alt have to be to max a profession to 300?
---
You really dont see the similarities? [https://prnt.sc/psguhg](https://prnt.sc/psguhg)
---
I have a level 52 sham, 44 mage, 42 warlock, and a 36 hunter.
---
I have a problem... and way too much free time!
---
This may be why you don't like it.
---
Try to interact with people more, talk with them and see what they are after rather than just using them as tools to complete a dungeon.
---
Ah very true, divine favor can be used on at least 25% of all holy shocks that are cast =p
---
Personally I like the AOE grind-ability of prot paladins so I'm definitely more of a blessing of sanc kind of guy, although this spec wouldn't really be that great for AOE grinding because you're missing out on some key talents.  But I bet it could still do it, and divine favor + holy shock on yourself is a great way to self heal and maybe be able to do some judgement /seal of wisdom instead of sticking with light.
---
[yank on those tubes, and you got yourself a raid boss](https://images.app.goo.gl/FynydLfZSboMLYGK9)

And time.
---
my dmb legit says 20 kills
---
Hunter is the solid 3rd best dps til/during BWL. But no way is it even close to #2 or #1
---
this almost smells like some fresh pasta...
---
this is either a big-brain troll or just a big, plain yikes
---
Brilliant video love it
---
Been leveling in the 50s in Brd so far.  Been getting a lot of good loot in there.  Hopefully when i hit 60 in like 5 levels I will be well geared with alot of gold.
---
I feel like a lot of these posts might be informed by retail thought process, where once the next content comes out, the current is pointless because ilvl resets and catchup gear etc. MC/Ony is an always thing and pugs will be going without fail for the next year+  until whenever TBC releases.
---
I did, and it was a problem. Crossroads was constantly devoid of questgivers and flightmaster. But go on. Tell us how your experience is the experience of everyone.
---
Just don’t join groups with dps warriors. I did and it made my time more enjoyable. I tried to give them a chance but it wasn’t worth it. Every other class doesn’t want to get agro, as they do less dps. But dps warriors TRY to pull agro so they get more rage and enrage.
---
Guess what, Tanks are in such demand you won’t have to wait any longer to get a group and 100% of the plate drops are yours.
---
Zero downside
---
I wouldn't say *much* higher, but initial threat gen should be improved.
---
It helps in dungeons especially because it's hard to get initial threat on large packs of mobs. A lot of times healers will get aggro on one or two early on and it's a juggling game to keep them or get them back and keep enough threat on the main target for dps to do their job.
---
The initial healing threat on top of your other abilities should make larger packs easier initially. A little healing only goes so far, but it gives you extra threat early on and delays when the healer needs to heal you.
---
All in all, easier dungeon packs.
---
Sure, keep not "investing early". More profits for me
---
I think I have cancer now.
---
Hey, and what about boyfriends? Just asking for... you know, research purposes.
---
I fought people so much in STV that I was literally attacking everyone I saw.  I haven't engaged in voluntary PvP since my mid 40s and I'm 57.  I got so sick of the downtime and wanted to just level up.
---
I just did it last week. Did you?
---
I get this
---
It doesn't even need to auto invite to work.  Anything is better than a shit chat window.
---
Or I could continue to raid with my spec that is 99% as effective as a full restoration spec.  :)
---
Dont forget nades on a 1min CD. A difference of life and death when waddling up to a mage.
---
you don't have to like it...i like it and that's all that matters
---
There is no honor point currency.
---
I think you're going to find guild recruitment opens up a lot once they open up paid transfers. Then you're not just locked to your one specific server but can move to a different one if a guild is looking for a spot you will be able to fill. This cross-realm recruitment was huge previously and I think is really important for the longevity of certain guilds.
---
There's always private servers if you really wanna run vanilla forever. But even most of them do periodic wipes or progress through expansions (before staring over) because people generally don't want to do the same content fie more than a few months.
---
I do but some days I just feel like grinding out that level watching netflix lol
---
Bgs existed, but also they werent that fun either. It probably would do no harm to have them up but I think the point of phase 2 having none of them is that its giving you the most raw experience of open world only pvp that isnt tied to a location, or reward other than your ladder rank.
---
Damn, where did you take the map from? All I see when I see when pressing the map button in the dungeon is the world map
---
I'll preface this by, saying I don't have much time to play, I just hit 60 last week and I'm just now working on getting some bis pieces. It only takes few minutes to figure out what they are and where you need to get them, which is worth doing since you'll have them forever. "But homework isn't fun". No, but playing your class/role to the max potential is way more fun when you put in the effort to have a bigger influence on the content you're doing. 
---
I'm all for being creative and silly but WoW isn't an art contest, it has parameters for something being good or bad. You can certainly do some crazy spec with talent points peppered all over the place but you can't be mad when someone asks "wtf are you doing" because you're slowing down the run for the whole group.
---
There's nothing wrong with only playing a few hours per week or not knowing every little nuance about your class/role but by proudly not doing your homework, expecting everyone else to spoon-feed you information and making excuses when someone questions your methods, you're being a burden on every group that has the misfortune of carrying you. You want to be taken more seriously? Stop being so entitled and lazy and do your damn homework.
---
Do you not have a guild?  Isn't this what guilds are for?
---
Fuck off. Tired of hardcore gamers masquerading as the norm.
---
Why are you farming them? I don’t think they’re bis for any class.
---
"Won" implies that there was competition. We can argue semantics over it, but you dont win something when its given to you because no one else wants it - You're given it.
---
I tend to. After about a half hour I'll just hearth or run back to a FP and then go to another zone.
---
Don't need it until Chromaggus really.
---
What UI is that?
---
What’s hard about it? Just use what gains the most threat aside from taunt. Easy.
---
Everyone freaking out about phase 2 has never played on an oceanic PvP server.
---
The last month I've been getting camped by ally players 35 levels higher then me in stone talon because fuck you, that's why.
---
Phase 2 means I'll be able to level to 48 in God damn peace finally.
---
As for "once you hit 48 they'll camp you for honor" I mean fuck, it's taken me over a month to get to 25, by the time I'm 48 they'll be raiding Naxx.
---
Of course, the community is totally different. We will never get the true vanilla experience back in 2004. It’s been so long, I don’t even remember exactly what it was like. I trust that the game version is true to what it was like back then
---
I did an ony 2 weeks ago with 1 rogue and double BF dropped. And I had called it before we even pulled. Just Classic tings.
---
I have no fucking clue what you’re on about, I actually quite enjoy reading guides/watching videos/any WoW content really. I just don’t shit a brick when someone asks me a question I can answer with literally zero effort. Fuck off dude.

**[NA][A][PVP][PST] [&lt;Hurricane&gt;](https://puu.sh/E76SK/7d8bdfff72.jpg) Raiding &amp; WPvP, Grobbulus RPPvP, optional RP**
---
___
---
Are you a seasoned player yearning for the old-style world PVP experience, and you want a guild designed around that need? Or are you unfamiliar with Classic, and want a supportive and organized community to provide you with the environment, advice, and the backup you will need to survive on a PVP server?
---
#####What we do:
---
* Weekly city raids. If you’re unfamiliar with city raids let us know in advance, we can bring newbies up to speed on the do's and don’ts of zerg vs zerg PvP
---
* Support our members and cultivate violence by prioritizing fast response to guildies under attack in the world
---
* PVE to PVP. 3 scheduled raids a week, 2 PvE and 1 City. With three current raid rosters, one for every day of the week, we have all days available for you to raid. All raids will start at the same time (5PM PST).  However, for both rosters we have a dedicated wPvP day on Thursday 5-8PM PST. **We will distribute loot with a modified DKP system** with class-specific sanity checks (Sorry Hunters, you can’t roll on the bindings). In addition to raids, DKP will also be awarded for wPvP attendance and raid roster slots will be open to those that consistently attends them
---
#####Who we are:
---
* A large collection of people who share similar interest in PVP and PVE alike, of all levels of experience
---
* A friendly tight-knit group who share a common interest in classic and other games
---
* Our culture is strictly old-school - we have loads of fun but won’t stand for pettiness, harassment, racism, or consistent mindless regurgitation of tired memes
---
#####Who we want:
---
* Guild oriented: helps others get their pre-raid BiS, and reasonably expects the same in return; willing to sacrifice their personal time to help protect members as they level, when it is both necessary and reasonable to do so
---
* Someone who’s friendly, willing to learn, communicative on Discord, and loves world PvP
---
* Punctual to whatever scheduled events they commit to
---
Regardless of your experience, we can take you in and teach you. If you’re a grizzled veteran craving that classic feeling that hooked you so many years ago, or If you’re a curious retailer who is uncertain on how far they intend to go with vanilla – you’re welcome, and you’re wanted.
---
###If you have any questions or are interested in joining, join our [Discord] (https://discord.gg/wc6HudX) server

#RECRUITMENT STATUS: RECRUITING ALL CLASSES LEVELS 25+ AND ALL 60’S WHO CAN JOIN OUR NEW THIRD ROSTER
---
lmao
---
Warsong supplies doesn't give xp.
---
All the book quests (shredder operating manual, green hills of stranglethron, can't remember but there's something for samophlange chain too.
---
Transfer to Netherwind.   The most chill server I've ever been on.   I'd say 90% of my encounters with the opposite faction have been peaceful.   I think because it opened after the initial wave, all of the obsessive tryhards already chose their server and we have the regular people that like to have fun and not worry about hitting 60 in the shortest time possible.
---
I cleared Strat Live (with BC talent) with my friend (so 2 people total). We were both 58.
---
do you think they're not?
---
Idk maybe I’m just way out of the loop because I refuse to have somebody tank for me. I’m dps spec and will refuse to dps dungeons because I like to set the pace. But spam tab sunders isn’t all you need when people are going wild. 
---
You can either tab sunder equally to ensure the dot cleaves or healers don’t pull Aggro, or you focus a few sunders on 1. Either wAy, there’s a good chance something runs off. You turn to get the ones who run and you’ve lost control of the originals. And because of how snowbally threat is, once you’ve lost it it’s incredibly hard to get back.
---
No-
---
Higher ranks of these abilities generate higher ranks of base threat. 
---
I think later expansions clarified the tooltips, but the overall effect was the same.
---
It's just the roll of the dice, I had a warrior in my guild end up with like 120 Angerforge kills before seeing a HoJ, just shit luck
---
There is nothing elitist about what I said but you are free to project your insecurities.
---
Hope you have some good long hours with your "big family" in MC.
---
Found the salty multiboxer.
---
You are a shitstain on the game by the way. Don't give a fuck if Blizz is okay with it, you suck.
---
Oddly satisfying
---
I’m a human, I think I just don’t understand wall jumping lol
---
I’m on a pve server myself, and I don’t think there will be much at all until bg’s unless they are organised guild v guild. 
---
While leveling I still see people helping each other out when they are stuck even if they are from another faction.
---
He has business having it by committing to obtaining it at such a disadvantage. People who put more effort into the game are going to have better gear, that's the nature of an mmorpg. Anyone else can also obtain the trinket if they really want to.
---
And I'm entitled to my opinion. But good lord don't expect to post screenshots of anything without being ready for everyone to talk shit on that.
---
holy shit, this is all new information.  I need to get these strats out to the other tanks ASAP
---
The Onyxia buff makes the game easier (obviously), but that's not what the post is about. The post is about ensuring that when people who care about inter-guild competition show up to compete, they all do so from a level playing field. 
---
Imagine you're a racecar driver and you race weekly. But when you show up for your race each week, every racer is assigned one of two random cars: an F1 car or a Ford Pinto. That destroys any competitive dynamic and makes you not want to race. I'm advocating putting people on relatively even footing, not making the game easier. Which is why I'd prefer they remove Ony buff entirely if the alternative is the current system, which cannot accommodate meaningful competition. 
---
As to your suggestion about coordination, that simply isn't possible in an environment where a) not every guild raids at the same time and b) is irretrievably susceptible to trolling. My guild is already in a community of others who coordinate Ony buffs - all of them recognize that coordination (which is already incredibly difficult) isn't going to be reliable on a single layer environment.
---
That's what everyone thought prior to the pvp patch in '05. There was a huge community interest in implementing dishonorable kills to prevent low levels from being harassed, then blizzard goes and implements NPC dishonorable kills simultaneously ruining city raids without solving the griefing issue.
---
We already have an addon for that.
---
The issue is that once I've won the next time they res and go after me one of the other guys in the zone that are leveling with me see me killing their faction and join in. I wish there was a way to convey "This guy started it, let him learn his lesson". Hard to beat that warrior when a 52 rogue joins in. I get deleted during the stunlock.
---
That's not actually a lot or gold at 54 lol
---
how is the goldshire inn scene?
---
Good luck haven’t played ally since vanilla no tips for you guys.
---
You make it sound as if people should not be allowed to filter their groups based on character class, gear, skill, etc and if they do then they are dicks. Is this your stance?
---
Damn that's pretty good. You're basically 1/6 of the way there already.
---
Far as I know wyvern sting cannot be cleansed as it is a stun. So rogue gets trapped into sting, warlock uses felhunter for cs option + root/sheep dispel. Like I said the third can be literally whomever, I would think warrior for this scenario for their burst but I literally think any class would be fine except maybe shaman or another hunter. Opener is most important but you just need to make the pally panic bubble, probably deathcoil into fear is enough.
---
Wait til you have to find the enchanting trainer in sun rock retreat... I shit you not took me an hour.
---
I think you have some solid thoughts but I definitely disagree with the lvl cap. I think that it's something that has to be improved or else the power creep becomes to much. You'll have such geared 60's that a fresh 60 will have no chance against. For PvP you already see this with players that are full MC geared vs Pre-BiS, and if you have 60's that are 4-5 raid tiers deep, it wouldn't even be close. 
---
I think what Blizzard failed to do (which is the same flaw in many movies) is not end the story. Sure, release a an expansion or two, increase the level cap, build some new mechanics, and add some more raids, but eventually it has to end. Start over and build WoW2 with a new story line, and improve on the mechanics of the older version. I think creators forget that it's OK to let something end. Without starting over, you create these amalgamations of the previous versions and eventually it starts to be incoherent (OP's point)
---
rogue bis
---
When I save horde from a pack of mobs I like to let them eat and drink up, they usually are giving me a /bye or a /thanks right as I charge in for the kill. I don't want them thinking I've gone soft, I mean what if a fellow Alliance is around and sees me helping Horde scum?
---
It's an anti-fraud trigger in an automatism that locks you out. It's very prone to false positives, make sure you don't log in too quickly after changing locations. The problem is the questionable quality of out sourced customer support, you have to push it until it gets to a person with enough IQ to review server side data and unblock you.
---
That was hilarious. All the cringe comments are from actual cringey people with low self esteem lol
---
Not if your dps focus kill the run offs
---
Thinking about it logically, no. If r1 sunder generated the same amt as max rank, warriors would be absolute threat gods early on.
---
I’m still installing CD #3
---
So, I'm working on leveling 10 characters.  Highest is currently level 33.
---
Exactly how screwed am I?
---
Usually anything in a dungeon is one faction. Strat would be an example where ghosts are separate faction and don't aggro if you pull undead next to them.
---
It's over 9000!
---
They are still working, though)
---
&gt;I agree though there is some degree of "slippery slope" that is a valid argument
---
The slippery slope argument is bullshit regardless of context. You'd be better off saying you just don't want blizzard to fuck it up given their track record as at least that makes some sense.
---
It's an argument people pull out of their ass because they have no real argument as to why something shouldn't happen other then "This may lead to worse things being let in further down the line", and use that thinking to bar any changes. 
---
We already have Auto Looting via Right click (instead of shift right click) option which wasn't present in 1.12 and came in the TBC Pre-patch, I don't see the fucking sky falling because of that change.
---
You could add a bunch of QoL features to Classic wow and it'd still be as good as it ever was.
---
Yup. This. When I started classic I said absolutely not to PVP realm. Went with PVE and every single time I log in I’m grateful that I made the right choice. All that nonsense would’ve ruined the experience for me.
---
Dude, thank you. I needed to read this today
---
You can solo it as a resto shaman
---
Uh yes they are.
---
"Mobile games are up 2 billion percent in China. We need to get into this market."
---
Blizzard makes Diablo Immortal.
---
u/AutismCatReee Fighting a shaman isn't as rigid as fighting other classes. Seeing how long such a fight can last, you should try to see how well versed the shaman is. 
---
Use couple R1 blessings and see if he keeps purging. If he does, keep spamming away, ooming him incredibly quickly. 
---
Trust me, I've fallen in that trap myself  as a shaman.
---
Isn't it a war though?
---
no one uses it though.
---
It can be a little cluttered, yeah.
---
Though I've found that if you use the general channel in whatever zone you're in, you can get invites pretty quickly.
---
In later version of the game u had Dungeon maps, this was just the first hit on Google images. Probably should have grabbed a higher quality image in retrospect.
---
Omg I had no idea.
---
Why the "don't upvote" comment?
---
Marcus Uristious. I lol'd
---
Have you ever participated in a city raid?  it's damn near impossible to avoid tagging a civilian NPC on your way to the boss's room.  The DHKs are shared raid wide,  so it only takes 1 person to tag something in the confusion of the fight and everyone in the raid is fucked.
---
I wish more people turned away low levels.. I typically run my own groups so I'm not carrying anymore.
---
Few hours per day if you are in farming premaid.
---
This is untrue, you need to constantly be moving from zone to zone.  The more you kill the same person, the less honor you get.  Those drawn out SS battles will start getting you little to no honor the longer you are there.
---
Just type "/join LookingForGroup" and you will see that people are searching for dungeons 24/7 :)
---
gonna request the context here. I personally can't stand when people 2-3 levels lower than the expected minimum for an instance try to join my group or i join a group only to see it full of low levels. you are wasting everyone's time.
---
You get proportional honor, so if you kill a 33 at 33 you get the equiv as a 60 killing a 60. So yes, having said that its weighed against others doing the same where 60s dont have much better to do than murder sooooo
---
If you're using default settings then you need to hold a button to chat.  I'd probably recommend changing the settings to always on.
---
I use the group voice chat feature quite a bit.  It works well.
---
Naw I’m on incendious
---
What do those whelps give you?
---
Sometimes I let them, other times it doesn’t work. They might hit too hard, they might be hitting a healer, they might have silences or CCs, etc. Also you can’t expect DPS to do that. and if somebody dies because somebody pulled aggro, it becomes a “bad tank” problem.
---
Wow. Yeah. Didn’t know.
---
Ashbringer have lots of activity. Liking it. Afraid of wpvp soon to create war upon the world.
---
I agree. Just some folks having a good time but people gotta find a way to poop on it.
---
You can't sell those so maybe you can't delete them? Same for the ring key for UBRS
---
With 300 weaponskill the hitcap is 9% in PVE, however the miss chance is 8%, because there's a mechanic that removes your first hit. So there's always been a lot of confusing whether its 8 or 9, but blizzard has confirmed 9.
---
Make it happen blizzard!
---
I started playing maybe two weeks after release, and I have a lvl 40 and a 30 that I've stopped playing. It's going to take forever to hit 60
---
This is absolute fucking gold
---
I'm not really sure what you mean with the brackets. Do you mean the leveling brackets (10-19, 20-29, etc.)? Then yeah there's a cap to how much RP you can earn and you'll eventually stall out at a rank.
---
How much RP you get is based on how much honor you earn each week relative to the rest of the PVPers in your faction. The person that gets the most honor for the week gets 13,000 RP (assuming level 60)--your PVP rank doesn't have any effect on this.
---
Your new RP is calculated as (Current RP - 20% Current RP)+RP earned.
---
So if you're a fresh rank 7 that gets the most honor for the week that's (25,000-5,000) + 13,000 = 33,000. It's easy to see why the grind gets out of hand as you need to pvp a ton just to maintain your rank at the higher ranks--you need to get near top rank 4 weeks in a row to go from rank 13 to 14. 
---
To reach rank 10 at 10,000 RP a week (a pretty dedicated amount of pvp each week), it would take 9 weeks. Taking a week off means losing more than a full rank at rank 7+
---
Lol i was trying to figure out which was the neutral, ratchet.
---
You cant avoid that no matter what spec you go so I don't see how its relevant
---
Bruh what are you on about im getting over 245dps at times, and about 200+dps on single target bosses.
---
Graphics will affect FPS, not MS unless I am completely mistake
---
Wait, how far on the range was it?
---
I agree with all your points and replies below. Unfortunately I have a feeling this will be ignored which is annoying.
---
I guess not, you could have the dps heal themselves and bring a bear tank. But I mean do you absolutely and truly need a tank at all? 4 mage 1 priest leggo.
---
Ok thanks
---
Esfand is not a good player. Having the onyxia buff 100% would be absurd. You can turn in the head whenever just doesn’t pop the buff
---
This is how servers get to that level. No one is staying on a server if they get ganked 2k times as said in the comment above.
---
&gt;Rockbiter weapon adds a flat amount of extra threat based on rank
---
oh shit, it doesn't scale by attack speed? that is an eye-opener for sure
---
&gt; Man if everyone could just ELI5 for us noobs that would be great. I like the posts here but have no clue what anything means.
---
Some NEET is investing a colossal amount of time now so that they can grief levellers and newbies and spoil PvP battlegrounds in Phase Three. The idea is to build a massively overgeared level 19 toon, with gear no legitimate newbie could possibly have, so they can win with zero skill.
---
These people will always lie and say they aren't in it to grief newcomers, they are really only there for Totally Real Fights Against Other Overpowered Toons. However we know they are almost all total liars because when they got segregated battlegrounds in WotLK just for this kind of overpowered toon they all logged off and didn't come back. Well, not until they could figure out ways of getting back in to regular battlegrounds and seal clubbing some more.
---
Recently, yeah. Not 1 week ago, but it's not 25g lol. Not even close
---
Tigole is 47!
---
Crusader to flex your disposable income.
---
you're wrong.  It parses chat, and is pretty much what you're asking for here.
---
Long distance runners have some of the smallest muscles of any athletes at the Olympics. Low impact exercise doesn't build much muscle.
---
You don't get dishonorable kills from players, at all. If they're gray you won't get honor. But, you'll only get a dishonorable kill from a civilian npc.
---
Slightly is a massive understatement
---
Horde - Mystreal
---
This was about a week or so ago.  In STV, slowly soloing my resto-spec'd shaman into the depths of the ogre mound, when along comes a night elf hunter, and we start leapfrogging pulls to get to the quest mob.
---
As we get to the end of the run, I dash forward into the last three mobs like I'm being overanxious, and let them kill me at the back, right behind the boss.  The night elf laughs and carefully clears the last two adds for me.  I reincarnated and killed the boss in his face.
---
This couldn't be more false...
---
You get less progress as low lvl, but getting to rank 3 is pretty easy and it gives you insignia(pvp trinket but worse in vanilla) and +10% discount on stuff in capital cities, which includes 10% off your mount.
---
you cant have huge battles on bliz servers what are you talking about lol...
---
Rogue bis is swiftwalker boots.
---
Why do you farm the low level mobs?i think the swift thistle drop another commenter mentioned sounds like a plan
---
Just grab the buff and log out. I could understand hours messing you up, but 30minutes? If you knew the timer and were prepared than you should have the buff. Most runs don’t start immediately after Ony head dropping anyway, grab the buff and log out.
---
This is why I just rerolled PvE.  I plan to level alts, don't have time for revenge.
---
Hey. Maybe they're a 29 Twink. Or maybe op will accidentally gain exp...
---
I had that issue as well in STV. It wasn't voluntary until the 4th or 5th gank and everyone was KoS after that. Once I left I just kind of went back to my "You don't bother me, I won't bother you, we just want to hit 60" I have a shit ton of time at 60 to PvP.
---
Ummm, mages don’t carry guns 😝😂😊
---
Someone else posting "dont worry about it" isnt going to do *anything* the second they scroll 3 posts down and see another post with someone having 2500g, epic mount, and full BIS plus more, making a nonchalant post about something funny in the chat log.
---
48 is when you start giving honor to level 60s who kill you,  and starting next tuesday every hardcore lvl 60 ranker is going to be living in the level 48+ zones farming honor for 12+ hours a day every day for a couple months straight.
---
These comments kek
---
The addon Group Bulletin Board does exactly what you're looking for
---
That would be really helpful. The worst part is having to lead with no idea what to do. I had one person in a run do all the marking for me and that helped a lot.
---
Meh. Good luck finding a ranking premade showing you have so little effort for bettering yourself in PvP for the sake of yourself and making your team more efficient.
---
I got 2 while getting it and I still haven't seen the belt off quartermaster after 15+ kills. It's just RNG.
---
Moving from zone to zone is key. Never stay in the same area for more than an hour at a time.
---
you mean you don't hang out at the meeting stones looking for a group?
---
pvp bis
---
Well they're only "bitching" because bad dps overpull on aggro, die, and then promptly blame the tank and healer.
---
I think the problem lies more with the hurry-go-go-go crowd who really should rightfully play with each other and stay that way. Because they seem to be the ones who are the more inflexible about things. They expect everyone around them to play like the streamers and promptly call anyone and everyone "bad" who isn't.
---
Use grenades, if you're not an engineer tank you're playing on hard mode with pugs
---
A solid read, thanks mate!
---
This what I do. At the very least I always have a quiver full in the MB and more in an alts mail for return.
---
Are you sure it's in the game?

Got ganked by an UD rogue while I was fishing a couple of times, went on a killing spree through Hillsbrad on characters 10 levels below me. I hope this distracted him from the river to look for me, as he was gone when I returned to the river. Or maybe he left and I just made sure that shit rolled down hill.
---
And neither require goblin/gnomish to use
---
Cool, an even better reason for me to stop playing
---
Thank you for not letting me know about this last month................
---
Cheeky boy yoinky roi!
---
Not really.  Blizzard doesn't like it when you automate.  Only streamline.
---
Also windshire crag and ashenvale
---
Kinda off topic here but I'm having trouble getting my UI change to stick. 
---
Unlocking and moving the built in unit frames for my character and its target wont save no matter what I do on my newest character. It's the only change that I want to persist but just doesn't. Another character its moved how I like it and it's fine so I'm not sure what could be interfering. I dont have any addons that mess with unit frames and I've tried logging out every which way I know how.
---
Why not just go play retail? I find it so odd that you play a game knowing full well what it has and doesnt, then are like "I would like this tailor-made to *me*". Get out of here with that.
---
"it works if the tank does this very specific thing that makes it work"
---
Now you're just grasping at straws.
---
That's not a bug, certain "combat" things like bloodrage can cause you to drop combat if you haven't done anything to that target after it engaged in normal combat. Range has nothing to do with it.
---
bruh wtf are you on
---
This exact same post is made every single day. Someone with no or little experience tells everyone else to calm down and then drops the pro tip we've all been lurking for - "just play at your own pace." Holy shit, a revelation has been made. Send this to the front page, we have a mission statement to make.
---
I think I threw up in my mouth a little after seeing that ui.
---
Oh god your profile, it's like you have to argue
---
Yeah, its looking like I'll be around 50. Atleast I can dungeon grind, but thats not as fun as aoe grinding
---
Doing the ambush animation now he woulda been treated as a school shooter rofl
---
They hated you because you told the truth.
---
People should just embrace it. Let it influence how you think and play.
---
Don't travel alone. If your heading to BRD travel there together. Be ready for a fight at any time. 
---
Try to have fun with it! Two level 50s can overpower a level 60. Have fun fighting other players and try to learn from each death you are delt.
---
Good god what happened to your UI
---
Lol, he asked which I would want to be, and I chose tank. It would have been nice to know about dungeons at the time
---
But you could say Gnomish tele trinket is more valuable than goblin. Is there something in Goblin that’s bop and goblin to use? 
---
Most take up Goblin to craft their explosives, but you can also just buy them off the AH and use them as gnomish. If you’re not mining, then you’ll be buying mats to craft your explosives anyway.
---
This is American buddy, if people wanna play 24 hours a day to hit rank 14 it's their god damn right to.
---
Only weapons swap in combat
---
She.
---
Just group up at Thorium point and travel there together.
---
if ya'll are running a tank/healer combo, i'd do you best to find / remember the friendly, patient folks who play dps and tell the rest to buzz off.  if someone complains, just be firm, "we're not doing a speed run, just playing to have fun and clear the whole dungeon, if you don't like it feel free to move on"  .  you two are in a good position to be choosy with who you play with
---
Question for the Paladins considering this, do you actually enjoy the play style? Whenever I have to shout spam on my warrior, I find it so boring.
---
What is your tank doing about it? Shit, it's one enemy. Taunt, snare, stun, etc.
---
Nah some people forget that you get more experience per kill and quest. So just doing the math by pure "amount of experience needed" isn't correct at all. The most time consuming level gap most people deal with is about 40-48.
---
War isn't over until they're all gone big boy
---
Rank14 is almost impossible to reach without literally playing 10+ hours per day and working together with other people to try and stop others from also getting rank14. You have to have literally no life whatsoever, for upwards of 2 months straight, to even have a chance of getting rank14.

I got Pagnip on Pagle server for my imp. Thought that was pretty cool! My warlock is my bank alt, so it’s fun having him run around while I do my errands.
---
The funny part about all these comments is they praise the other version I use on my mage yet this one seems to trigger some people.. dunno why it works for me though
---
I'll be doing PvP when there's no Guild dungeon run or scheduled raid or I'm not farming for consumables. There's no set Rank in my mind as a goal, more like an activity for rewards when there's nothing else to do.
---
well i got the sword! so im ready to rock. think im gonna hit maraudon hopefully once or twice tonight, see what i get then either continue that, depending on what i get or move on to ST. Thanks for the advice
---
Why is your mini map spewing green stuff? Why does your UI have cancer?
---
Bad actors aren't a concern to me personally because I always do everything with the guild.  For more casual players just wanting to have some fun and join a city raid PUG... would be hard to distinguish between  ignorance/mistakes/sabotage. I dont think its an understatement to say you could flatline a R14 player with 1 city raid.. Theres a reason it all changed lol
---
No joke, it's the best server I've ever played on since WoW came out!
---
Thank you bud!
---
The #1 reason I will never play on a PVP server are tools like that. Also STV.
---
More horde favoritism
---
Will do. Between the Horde raid on IF and our raid on MC in the last few days, it might be a while though.
---
Yeah it so hard! I never got lucky ;( but that's fine I am glad you got your  name:)
---
Who the hell downvotes for trying to network with people. Wtf
---
Yeah I don’t think anyone in their right mind argues that this is a good system. I agree with keeping it due to no changes but it’s pretty funny how most people that finally make it quit or take long breaks.

It took an hour to find the cords on wowhead?

I don’t know how to tell you this except just to say it. Dragons don’t exist.

"Heh he's just having fun, people are laughing with him it's all good... oof. That's unfortunate."
---
I'm using low level examples because that is what I can definitely prove. Tanking via generating the more damage and sustaining is still tanking. In which world are you living in where that isn't the case? We can go talk about that later since Vanilla was a long time ago and seemingly no one cared to look back at where end game ended. 
---
I can't speak for high level dungeons because I have not done it, however I have seen it in my groups the first time around and even on Strath and Scholo where a DPS tank did supremely well, cleaved through the dungeons like it was nothing. 
---
If you are bringing up raiding then hate to tell you fury tanking is a thing and it echos end of vanilla when DPS was so high that you ether figure out how to generate more threat or have your DPS throttle their damage. I'm sure you can guess which ones were the higher skilled players. So stay in your comfort zone, but there are guilds and groups that will shit all over yours.
---
&gt;but the community thinks it wants it gone
---
literal "you think you do but you don't" guy right here. We wanted vanilla, no one had any delusions that there would be competition for resources.
---
I feel the same way on Blaumeux. Most people are super chill even at max level and raiding...I can't really relate to a lot of the complaints on this sub at all.
---
Fuuuuuuuck
---
You can hand it in you just don't get the buff. I did this as raid has a few heads
---
This is accurate only with non healers.  As a healer doesn't need to do damage. They can and I have went into every dungeon and healed every bit of it, earlier than what is recommended.  In my mid 20's I was told I wasn't able to heal sm. I was told that in rfd, ulda, zf,Maura. Healed it at 39. Rest of group was like 48-52 whatever. Told that in sunken temple.  Had a few groups say I stand corrected.    So youre not entirely right
---
I ran this the long way the other day. On my alt... Ugh.
---
Except how do you clear crippling poison currently? I get opened on by a rogue with crippling and I cant clear it and get enough space. Granted in most cases when I've encountered a rogue on my hunter they've been higher level and I was BM. Am I forgetting a way to get some distance? Been years since I've pvped in WoW on even footing. I've heard to use the restoration elixir to clear it, I've got some of them now.

"befriended tanks".   aka you added them to your friends list, and then spammed them constantly when you wanted to run something.  I've had several dps befriend me.  It's quite annoying.

I have a doozy for you. This was Sunday on Thunderfury.

Link up with another Druid pal in STV and we help each other finish a quest near the arena. I ask if he can help me with Big Game Hunter and he says sure. So off we go to where the mob is and, wouldn’t you know it, some lv 40ish nelf hunter is actually really close to soloing the thing. So what do I do? Bear form, enrage, charge him, I’m hitting him, Druid pal is hitting him, quest mob is at 3%, I get up in his face with a bash, he feigns, I finish him off, mob jumps to 30% and we catch the tag as it resets. And we got it. Sorry bud! Druid and I are bros now.

I am not saying it is game over because I pulled off the tank, but every now and then I take a nice beat down from the Boss due to rng. As a glass cannon one attack from the Boss puts me in a position where my survival is 💯 dependant on how well the other players in my party play.
---
Everyone defending Prepared doesn't seem to know that he is a terrible blight on the game and multiboxing. He is one of the reasons that temp bans and temp silences for being mass reported are such an issue. He frequently would just report with 40+ accounts at once and get people banned until it can be reviewed. He was exceptionally annoying during WoD because he would just sit in cities being nigh unkillable and making the server unstable.
---
And God, his voice.
---
&gt;...looks a **bit** like...
---
No one is saying it's the exact same thing, just that they are similar.
---
[Here's](https://prnt.sc/psguhg) a comparision showing that they do look a **bit** similar courtesy of /u/Matthiass
---
You can call them bad dps, but they're bad tanks too. I agree if dps is overpulling they should hold back, and that makes the idiots too. I've been in runs where the 3 dps were absolute monsters and it really didn't matter if any one pulled aggro, the mobs would get melted or the dps knew how to handle them.
---
I don't need any attitude adjustment at all, you seem to have no problem calling dps bad but refuse to accept that those tanks are bad. Seems you're either ignorant to the mechanics of tanking or just a bad tank too.
---
This is accurate I remember sharing my step-dads warrior to get to Marshal, we combined played about 14hrs a day in a pre-made PvP group (the top one in the server.) We even had Comms with horde PvP groups to rotate who wins/loses to maximise games. Even then the hours put in were insane. I imagine this time around it's going to be worse.

**Guild Name: Warmongers**
---
**Server: Benediction/ Horde**
---
**Region: NA**
---
**Focus: PVE/PVP**
---
**Contact Info:**  [**https://discor.gg/DvUMK3w**](https://discor.gg/DvUMK3w) **or contact Amrin, Dragorvis, Bahl, in game** 
---
**Raid times: Thursday-Saturday 7-10 East (Server Time)**
---
**Loot Rules: Master Loot (Loot Council) (Main spec Rolls)** 
---
Warmongers are looking for more to join their ranks. We are a 10 year old guild with friends and family spanning several games and platforms. What started around 2007 with a few military service members and friends creating a guild in World of Warcraft, has blossomed into a lifelong friendship/Community.
---
Our Goals are to create an environment in which you can accomplish your goals, but not have to worry about strict guild raid times or other unnecessary rules that simply make the game not fun. With that said, we are all about fun! And strive to create a mature environment in which our members can enjoy the game with a group of players that are looking for the same thing. 
---
We are currently still trying to fill all spots for a core raiding team. We have about 10 solid members that are ready right now but we are looking to grow into a 40 man group and need all roles/specs/classes. 
---
Clarification on master loot- we are not here to ninja loot. I have seen it all too many times over the years that people will need roll on something they simply do not need. We have had a lot of success with master loot/loot council, we just simply do not want a mage to be able to roll on a tanking item etc… if an item drops that your class and spec can use then by all means you will be able to roll on it, and if and when your roll wins you will win the item. Master loot just guarantees that the raid group will become better week after week. If there are any questions are concerns please feel free to reach out.
---
What we want 
---
* Positive mental attitude 
---
* 18 years of age or older
---
* People that think outside the box 
---
* Helpfully mentality 
---
What we don’t want 
---
* Children (this is not daycare) 
---
* Better than you attitude 
---
* Someone who just wants loot and will leave guild if they don’t get it. 
---
* Negative/pessimistic attitude that complain a lot.
---
To be clear, you only get 1-1 on damage to threat so you are building less threat with your base dmg, however this loss is far outweighed by the gains of rockbiter threat. Ideal scenario is a 1.9 or 2.0 "one hand" mace as opposed to a main hand.
---
Stonard gang rise up.

the furbolg farmer are gonna get it too even if 60
---
At the time I was in Badlands, there was like 50/50 Horde/Alliance each camping a single spawn point for Lesser Rock Elementals per person under some unspoken mutual agreement. That quest took ages to complete.
---
You come off as quite offensive. 
---
No, 3 of them I hang out with on discord a few times a week on different occasions, chat with and run dungeon groups with. I'm playing healer, and they seem to appreciate both my company and competence.
---
I could give back a snarky retort here, but I am guessing other people cover that part
---
If only you discovered what print screen does.
---
Thanks! My husband has been trying to show me a lot of the tricks to it, like LOS, and talking me through it, but it seems overwhelming at times.
---
Would love to see someone like you break it down for everyone the time difference you would have spent finding only the people you needed for your groups rather than jumping in already configured ones.  Overall I feel you would be somewhere in the many many hours extra spent making sure you didn't have a lower level than you intended 
---
Overall I mean also include the argument you so naturally must have.  Including all wipes amd frustration you believe you experienced from not fast enough lol
---
are you guys playing on laptops by chance?
---
The real BiS is mcp from Gnomeregan for threat generation but I suppose few understand that a level 30~ weapon is the best at level 60. (for both cats, bears and ret paladins
---
I used Sevenleaves/Tactics which is for Horde but there will be others for Alli.
---
yeah and were gonna get a : look most server arent layered we did our job
---
Actually a good point, 
---
Would really promote the twink bracket
---
And there is another one from where you enter the zone to that small troll place right after
---
I'm on Grob as well and I totally regret rolling undead priest. I'm 59 now so it would be dumb to switch to troll. ):
---
Oh yeah trolling and memes aside. Every fucking person should have a threat meter at the very least. It is annoying and takes forever for tank to round up everyone each time a hunter wants to drop all Cooldowns 39 yards away lol
---
A lot of people seem to think pulling for the tank makes everything easier but they are just gimping the tank.
---
Hahahaha also a good point vos if you aoe without letting the tank even know you’re going to die. 
---
The rule is though the group goes as the tank goes

Not from a female cow I don't.

No, they didn't. They changed it so that any one player can only leave behind 1 skeleton in the world at a time instead of multiple. They were never going to remove skeletons.

Nah

---
I am a new player, both to WoW and MMOs in general. I'm almost at level 60 now. My 2 cents on how I handle grouping with other people:
---
* Definitely Google stuff that you need to know before playing with other people. Things that you need to know in order to not make people waste their time. Don't want to lookup a drop list for each boss or which items are BiS for you? No one cares. Intend to tank ST and have absolutely no idea of dungeon layout or mechanics? Google. Your PUG shouldn't be forced to put up with that.
---
* ALWAYS make clear before joining/inviting people to your group about your situation. A simple "hey, I'm new to the game and never been to BRD yet, are you okay with that?" is more than enough. People who are okay with it and feel like helping you will invite you anyways. People who are looking for a quick run and would prefer to get experienced players will let you know. Then everyone's happy.
---
* Interact with other new players. Add them to your friends list, play with them. Experience the game together. The most fun run I've ever had so far was a 5 new players Maraudon run where no one had a clue of what we were doing.
---
* If you're already in a PUG and people start to get annoyed at your gameplay or feel like you're slowing them down, simply remind them you're new to the game and are not familiar with the dungeon. Tell them that if they feel like it they an just look for someone else to replace you in the group and offer to leave if they get someone. Why would you want to stay in a group you clearly don't fit in anyways? And you also get to watch them play and learn a thing or two in the run even if you leave. I've said this a couple times and absolutely never got replaced, just be polite and people will understand you.
---
* Learn your role and Google some basic stuff about it, like talent specs or stats you should be prioritizing. No one cares if you have BiS gear or not, but don't join a group as a dps that deals zero damage because of wearing completely random stuff... It's just the polite thing to do.
---
* If a group you joined is clearly toxic to you and you're not having a good time in it, simply let them know: "hey guys, I think I'm not fitting in this group and I'm not playing the way you'd like, I think it's best for all of us if you just find a replacement for me" and just leave after they do. That's it. It's a game, if you're not having fun, don't go on.
---
Oh and also, based on your reply I'll assume you play tank.
---
If so, how on Earth are you having enough issues finding groups as the most sought-after role to actually make a post about it? That is the real question.
---
Good luck using LIP when two rogues can just kill you within one stunlock.
---
And they can just blind the lip and reset afterwards.
---
Also doing battleground from time to time while leveling a new class was a teaching experience. It gave you enough knowledge by trial an error to be ready to react quickly and decisively even when someone attack you by surprise.
---
are you Airassault?
---
She killed an alliance and took it off them.
---
If you are continuously pulling aggro *every* pull I will just let you deal with it.  Im sure you can hadle a mob or two, and if not, just die.  You dont seem to understand group mechanics, you are just trying to top the damage meters.  Synergy and teamwork will make for a better run than a single asshat who thinks the group formed just to watch him do mad dps.
---
Yeah, if it's one 60 vs. one 60.
---
Not if you're waiting for the guy with the key to come to Strat UD when five of the enemy roll by and 5-v-1 you.
---
Not if you're in combat with an elite and they come by.
---
Not if you're in combat with several mobs.
---
Not if you're at low health from your last fight.
---
Not if you land at a flight point and there are 8 horde there.
---
PVP servers are anything but the honorable duel between two fighters.

other people in different circles dont play the way I do!!! IM MAD! I QUIT!
---
I'm a girl btw!!!
---
Just because YOU want to play slowly doesnt mean everyone else does. Sure play the game at your own pace.. but everything punkrat and others say, is entirely 100% true. Dont think just because you havent been ganked into logging off yet, doesnt mean it wont happen. Im sire theres a lot of people that will be Molten Core heroes for the rest of the game, but those of us that know the landscape and layout of game mechanics, lvld our alts super early or in tandom woth pur mains so we wont be camped.
---
Look into FAPs, thank me later
---
You can only get honor for killing the same player 10 times a day, so the tryhard groups will quickly farm each other out and will have to look for stragglers to get more honor.

Corpsecamped for 6 hours aswell ^^

no one plays a game with 1hr+ queue times
---
Nice one!
---
Got SGC 2nd time i did garosh. Got hoj right after. Did maybe 40 runs of arena
---
Lowest I see there is level 28, so let's just assume they're all level 28. It takes 413.300 exp to reach level 28, that times 40 is 16 million exp.   
---
Reaching level 60 however is 4 million experience.
---
So yeah, Prepared here has FOUR TIMES as much experience on the field yet he loses. What say you now?
---
Yeah but we're talking about doing 5 mans, usually with pugs. This is the issue. You cannot compare a guild fury tanking bosses to a pug doing stratholme. There are SO many variables in pugging. And no, tanking by outdamaging everyone isn't really the same because the moment you stop outdamaging everyone you're no longer the tank. That's why fury is fine in raids. You've got more rage than you know what to do with and your healers go into it knowing what you're doing and that you'll take way more damage. And you're tanking one mob most of the time to boot. 
---
If you go into Scholo with your gatorbite axe on from Maraudon and get into a group with mages and locks using raid gear, you ain't holding aggro with your damage. This is what I mean by variables because with a pug you can get anything. What works for coordinated groups doesn't translate to pugs.
---
Yes, I've seen a number on the AH. It's just a ridiculous farm
---
Turning your back to the mobs chasing you. I hope a lesson was learnt. Praise Miette
---
And that took you an hour?
---
Hey, this is where I dinged 60 two days ago too!
---
Grats!
---
If you do enough keys you should average out to a profit, but at that price it may not be worth the time spent. Typically you want keys at 20-30s to really make it worth your time.
---
I assume it's about 109, 113, and 119 getting skipped.
---
Oh, you big mad
---
I got a green ring with +17 Nature Resistance. Is this going to be worth anything when AQ releases or is there better options? I want to know if I should hold onto it or sell it now.
---
Level 51 hunter checking in :-(
---
We \*are\* talking about the kinds of people who still play vanilla World of Warcraft here.
---
I spent 2 hours grinding, and subsequently ranting in Discord about low drop rate quests before I remembered that I was still in a Raid Group.
---
I've tanked Classic from 20-60 and done almost every 60 dungeon as a Holy spec tank. Don't listen to people saying Holy Shock is bad; it's the single best tool you get out of the holy tree.
---
Your options are basically 31/20, relying on Holy Shock to function as a soft taunt and the ability to easily flex into healing while sacrificing direct mitigation.
---
Or you can go into 11/31/9 to have parry out of Ret, much greater mitigation, easier mana costs, and poor ability to flex heal, while also suffering from the fatal weakness of a Paladin tank: you have zero ability to re-establish aggro once something gets off you. Zero.
---
Any boss with an aggro reset essentially wrecks you, including LBRS, Srat UD, and many more. This build primarilly should be though of as a raid-spec option that excells at AOE or single-target tanking.
---
I highly reccomend a variation of the build you have going here, my key differences are 5/5 Improved SoR since it's your main threat generation tool. 2/2 Improved Blessing of Wisdom (you always have this up on yourself pretty much), and less points in Lasting Judgment. As a tank, useless, and as a healer you get 80% value out of one point doubling the duration. The rest of the points are rather wasted.
---
Have tanking brother.
---
Just wait for.Phase 2. You wont get gsnked or camped at all.
---
Farming while you're leveling up an alt :)

Dude is literally lvl 2, anything but hogger is going to net this response.

Lol at all you people who honestly think youre going to hit rank10 before BWL comes out when there are no BGs! Ahahahahahahha cry more please. Youre never going to hit those ranks.
---
Late 40s to early 50s were a bit of a drag. 54 on went much more quickly
---
Thats sad.
---
Be like me. Play PVE. its amazing how few times Ive been ganked!
---
Bears have insane threat without MCP, you don’t need it unless you have DPS in crazy gear.
---
It’s more worth it to get a Warden Staff or Unyielding Maul for mitigation, unless you’re literally in the top .01%, or are in Naxx gear somehow.
---
I'm definitely part of the problem, being muslim refugee scum myself.

Copy the addons files to a USB or save them to your cloud drive and drag em into the appropriate macbook folder

It might have caused a psychological scar cause as he continued wow playing he was obsessed with leveling alts. His account is litered with like 2 dozen alts which were all max lvl mains/alts during the xpac he played it.
---
First off, being able to clear MC within 11 weeks since launch is not hardcore by any stretch of the imagination. I'm sure this may come as a surprise, but MC is an extremely easy raid that requires little to no effort. It's mostly just an excuse to shoot the shit with your guildies for 3 hours and have a good time. 
---
Secondly, what is with this casual v. hardcore obsession? I've never even seen these terms have any effect on the game (ie "hardcore gamers" ganking known "casuals.") The only time I've ever seen this distinction is on these types of threads, with people like yourself complaining about problems that simply aren't there. Like releasing phases on a faster time table is going to take away the game experience for people still leveling.
---
Yup, I've seen several recipe campers mysteriously disappear forever.
---
You can do it on the Alliance if you go to the keep in Durotar
---
I didn't think they were that funny...

Other than having an alt reset dungeon while everyone else just logs to chat screen , maybe sending minor speed increase and some decent boots to alts for leveling . Depending on your gold stack

My sides!!

Yknow what man, Im gonna be honest.

I cared a little.

Yes, that definitely helps, thanks. I've been standing very close to mobs, mostly habit from trying to avoid asspulling in dungeons. I'll start keeping my distance when possible.
---
Quite possibly. I tried to watch for stuff like that, but it's certainly possible I missed something.
---
It usually goes:  
---
Sunder  
---
Frostbolt/shadowbolt/mind blast  
---
Taunt  
---
Sunder
---
ultimate spellcleave
---
*Covers Dratini's ears*
---
Oh fuck , I had to wait 15-20 after I cleanse?!
---
That’s bullshit
---
But thank you, I’ll have to go back and wait
---
The biggest secret in Classic WoW for wars that was kept from me (at least I have never seen it written down or in a video or anything) is that The Nicker for Orcs fucking PUMPS with windfury in raids and is easy af to get. Fish like a motherfucker with hamstring for WF procs and flurry uptime. When you're not raiding, focus on keeping flurry up with hamstring and you'll get the feel for it. It has 4.0 speed.
---
Heavily depends on your servers price for arcane crystal and blue sapphires.
---
It would cost me if I went to AH and bought right now probably 1200g+craft fee of 30g on my realm.
---
Easier for yourself would probably mean that you create dm east jump runs groups as a tank and reserve the nodes in the end and just do that over and over for crystals/sapphires if you got mining.
---
Players giving DHKs is one of the worst ideas that I see the playerbase constantly bring up.
---
The problems it would cause are immeasurable.
---
From my experience:
---
Tanks complain about tanking. 
---
Healers complain about healing.
---
DPS complain about not blasting.
---
All you have to do is just use dark/demonic runes, major mana potions, nightfin, greater arcane elixir, elixir of shadow power and flask of supreme power and you should be top 10 dps every time for boss fights (best guild on my server). I've been on the allstar boards 5-7 rank a couple times already for spriest. Most people don't know how to play spriest though even though you literally just dot and rotate Mind blast, mindflay, mindflay over and over. No one wants to commit to this every week and wants to just rat up a MC spot and try to get anathema. That's why no one likes shadowpriest.
---
ST has the added benefit of being enough out of the way it won't be a complete shitshow like Blackrock Mountain
---
Mind control has a very short range, so unlikely.
---
Aggro only leashes so far. Just keep running.
---
wait dk are going to be implemented? what does this mean to the ppl that raid citys?
---
is there a way to view my classic character the same way you can view your retial character? see all the stats, gear, etc?
---
Absolutely, being polite and willing to ask questions seems to be they key.
---
I’m totally cool with people needing items they think of as an upgrade, but others are touchy. Easiest thing to do, “Can I roll need?” If asked why, present a simple justification.
---
For 99% of folks I’ve encountered, they’ll be totally cool with it because you’ve proven yourself to be considerate.
---
You come across as a major baby here dude. Are you on a pvp server?
---
Youtube downvotes on a cinematic mean nothing. Last I checked it was 22,000 downvotes.... 22 thousand. This game has millions of fans. 22 thousand is nothing. It may be the most downvoted but that really isn't saying much.
---
use twitch app for add-ons catalog, downloading and usage in future
---
For me I could care less what other people think of me. I would trade a bunch of people thinking I'm weird for the joy and laughter of my friends every day of the week.
---
Wow theres the filthy casuals then theres the max level no-lifers then theres multiboxers then theres you.  You are so boring its embarrassing.
---
There's a shitload of changes already
---
People are literally doing it in less than 40 minutes already. Check warcraftlogs
---
No nut November taking its toll eh ?
---
The lore has absolutely always sucked.
---
You're not wrong, you can have the same interactions if you put the effort into it.
---
But in my experience, the LFD takes away a lot of that interaction and most players are happy for it all to be automated so it dies quietly in the background.
---
What does a stack go for on your server?
---
Depends if you're horde or not, windfury is very good with slow weapons. Better to dump rage into all abilities that can proc WF instead of using a dagger and spam HS to dump it, HS for a horde should be avoided if all possible.
---
“All this PvP on my PvP server!!! What ever will I do”
---
I learned my lesson 15 years ago
---
Mana efficiency is only one consideration.  It's important, but throughput and more significantly the distribution of your healing matters.  This is why you use Chain Heal for raid healing even when Healing Wave is more efficient (it already is more efficient once you have any kind of decent gear, even without the tier 1 bonus).
---
Fire reflector.
---
&gt; These damn hypocrites are the same one who cried wolf saying "bUt LeVeLiNg Is PaRt Of ThE vAnIlLa ExPeRiEnCe" 
---
I don't think "crying wolf" means what you think it means
---
And are people really asking blizzard not to turn on honor?  Complaining about how bad it will be for 50s, is not the same as actually asking Blizzard not to do it.
---
Kind of a bittersweet hello...
---
Is everyone from your guild trying to get the Tidal Charm or do you just stay to help your guildmates? I swear I see at least 3 different Look Alive members camping Prince Nazjak everyday.
---
People already do that.
---
57. I had done the grind and could farm dungeon groups with my guildies, it was the first consistant time to playing with them and it's been great since. Just downed ony.
---
and $&gt;everything amirite?
---
I rolled a 2 on Viskagg the other day. felt like a kick in the balls
---
NICE
---
Just hit 48, not looking forward to my last 12 levels
---
You can use dueling for that too
---
25min exactly, then you can loot it again 25min after that.
---
Yeah it is that fast now with 1.12 itemization and the knowledge we have of the game. My guild is made up mostly of people who are married and have kids and full time jobs. We just dedicate one night to MC and usually clear in about 2 hours. As long as your group is fairly competent this is easily achievable being a normal adult with responsibilities
---
Extendedcharacterstats is an addon that calculates and shows the info that is missing from regular character sheet, so you can see spell crit, spell damage etc.
---
I might just quit until phase 3.
---
It is ridiculously useful and has 0 drawbacks from turning it on.
---
Maaan im still tryna get through STV at level 36
---
Right now I’m halfway to lvl 39 on my main. Definitely going to start putting more time in because I want to get to more end game content. But this was nice to read. I still feel like I’m lvling slow as all hell. 6 days /played so far

Make this a thinf
---
I just tanked a scholo run with a 58 hunter. His pet pulled aggro and wiped us twice. He body pulled I dunno how many times.
---
I won't go back with any dps that isn't 60
---
to a company in a capitalistic world? I'm gonna say....yes.   
---
You know, it's hilarious to me -- and I'm not gonna take the time to dissect your comment history BUT statistically speaking, it's probably a good guess to say you'd be included -- that game forums are RIDDLED with pro libertarian nonsense whenever politics get discussed....but let a game company implement those libertarian capitalistic values and those same neets will lose their fucking minds.
