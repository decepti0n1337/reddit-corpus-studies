I try and avoid wpvp ( on an overpop pvp server for reasons) it doesn't always work and even tho I prefer pve servers, I have come to almost enjoy it at times. My favorite encounter was in STVietnam. Seen an alliance player just having one of those" yep I fucked up this pull" moments. I was a higher level and really was there cleaning my quest log. I dont like abandoning quests. I carefully targeted the mobs, blew them up and sat and had food and drink. I forget the quest name but it had something to do with elite cats. We each wait for the respawn. Respawn happend I/point to him, then the mobs. He tags em, I kill them. A few emotes are exchanged and we part ways. It was a nice change of pace.  That's something I will miss on a pve server. Sure I can help out the other faction there, but there really isn't any tension. For all I know he was second away from calling for my death and I assume he might have been wondering if I was gonna give him a free trip to a spirit healer.

It's funny, all the arguments against PvP servers (the way people supposedly behave) are exactly how players on PvE servers act when flagged... There is no on/off honorable fights on PvE servers. If youre flagged, that is something out of the ordinary and I want to gank your stupid ass for being flagged. On PvP servers, you have to decide if you want to start a battle. You ahve to decide if it's worth the risk of retaliation. Every enemy you see, you have to decide if it;'s worth the risk, or if it's honorable to fight them.  
---

---
Everyone who plays on PvE servers, thinks there is no honor in PvP, and will attack anyone who is flagged because they aren't used to making the honor/risk decisions.
---
Trolls Female are like finding unicorns.
---
found the warrior.
---
make sure to play horde as a lock. 90% of horde is undaead and immune to fear. there is a reason horde win battlegrounds more
---
Wow was made for a casual audience....it was designed to bring in people who found other mmos too time consuming and complex--what are you on about?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
As compared to every other MMO on the market on 11/23/04 wow was by far the most casual--and it blew the fuck up because of it.
---
+healing damage etc ok
---
Resistances hell no
---
So, while there is no built in ranged pull I believe there are items (from engineering?) That you can use to ranged pull. If not, I would usually have a spellcaster ranged pull for me, drop consecration, and judgement or stun that particular Mob to gain aggro. In a decent amount of situations, I was able just to run in and drop consecration, sit down to proc redoubt, and use holy shield. The no taunt can be a pest, but blessing of protection and your stun can be used when you get a dps who just hammers a mob taking aggro from you. 
---
In terms of damage reduction, speaking entirely from 5 man's, a lot of the prot pally is based around blocking, so although you don't get huge damage reduction from something like shield wall, the constant block buff from holy shield, redoubt, and blessing of sanctuary did a decent job for me. Plus, if a pull gets extra hairy, you do have lay on hands to save yourself from near death, Mana pot, and right back into the action.
---
No Mana can be an issue sometimes. But so long as your smart about your pulls, and bring Mana potions, you shouldn't have a problem with Mana when handling a pull. The biggest drawback is that dungeons do tend to take a little longer, because if you want to max aggro you have to max Mana expenditure, but in the event you would try to conserve some Mana during a pull, your aggro would suffer a little bit and you could possibly lose aggro a couple times. It really depends on the group dynamic this one. If you get a group that is on the same page about the prot pally, then you will get a faster run. But those who want to go go go will find you drinking more than you might need to because they ass blast the mob at the start of the fight.  
---
Keep in mind this is purely me speaking from experience, and I could have changed some things to make it a bit easier on myself that I just didn't think of. Cheers! I hope you do a tankadin like I plan on doing and have just as much fun being the awesome AoE tank you can!
---
Discord is buggy for me atm but I’ll join it soon as I can
---
Casual player here:
---
I started many characters, but my Priest was the only one I ran to max level. I wasn’t very good, but there was something fun about being the guy that the team needed to stay alive.
---
I plan to roll a priest when Classic returns just for that reason.
---
What a classic, I've found the original and will upload it for sure :D
---
Resists were important in a number of fights though.
---
 [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Talk:Weapon\_skill](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Talk:Weapon_skill)
---
Nice thanks for sharing
---
Are you being serious? Is Priest the hardest class?
---
Do you really need to min max t2 drops that hard, though? Nothing in BWL or AQ is a hard dps check. 
---
If you're all about min maxing yourself to the nth degree to absolutely crush what is already fairly easy content--sure. But that level of min maxing just doesnt seem needed so long as 35/40+ of your raid can play as opposed to the (at best) 25/40 that could in vanilla (and what "can play" meant in vanilla means dramatically less than today). 
---
Ill probably do it cause I imagine Ill have no life once this game comes out (again?), but unless we get a load of Azuresong mageblades and/or claw of chromagus ill be looking to stay with a staff till AQ is on farm.
---
mostly tanks or selected people, more on like Viscidus.
---
Well everything is situational. For the majority of cases I do not struggle against warriors. They're basically a free HK as nf/Conflag with a succubus and are easily tanked as soul link with a voidwalker. Other specs may struggle. I also have little experience against ud warriors as I play horde.
---
Saph comes to mine as well, but yeah few and far between to use resist gear, but mostly it's DE fodder!
---
Troll rogue least played race/class
---
Last time I leveled a rogue I was incredibly surprised by how many people left me alone. I was only jumped maybe 3-4 times through the whole leveling process (and no this wasn't on retail).
---
I think people recognized that it's not a good idea to antagonize the guy who can watch you while invisible and follow you for as long as he likes.
---
Did you mostly level together with other people or alone?
---
This man is correct. With few exceptions, every major mmo released since wow have had a pve focus. The draw to classic for me is the free-range organic pvp. I don't understand what the appeal is to pve players now that better pve experiences are available.
---
What’s a good alternative to STV as alliance?
---
1) you aren’t a PvE carebear 
---
what else needs to be said!
---
You certainly missing a part of the game . But its an option for a reason, some people don’t like that part of the game. But objectively, yes you are missing out on an experience the game can provide
---
Haha no you did fine. I was just making a self-deprecating joke
---
Bubble is the best instant heal, it just can't be cast on non group members
---
Hunters are the worst send in pet pew pew... dead.
---
No they are not the hardest class. They are supposedly pretty decent for leveling and they have pretty good group play. I would think warrior is the hardest class if there is such a thing
---
Look man, I really don't know how else to explain it to you. But fine, I'll go through this entire thread to show you what you're thinking vs what I'm thinking.  
---
This all started from here: 
---
&gt; Ugh the extent which people go to shit on Druid content is so frustrating... don’t listen to the hate Ebn, love your vids and the other content you produce for us. This video is HUGE and makes me even more confident that I’m making the right choice maining Druid in classic! 
---
Okay, so that's one person explaining to someone to ignore the shit that people throw at druids and to not listen to "the hate".   
---
Then, I agreed with that person:
---
&gt;I swear the VAST majority of people hating on druids have never played one, and certainly not in Vanilla.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;It's a GREAT class and INSANELY fun.
---
Then, you asked for evidence from this thread. 
---
&gt; Name one comment in this thread that is hating on druids. 
---
Which, first of all should be unnecessary because it happens in pretty much every thread that mentions druids. But fine, I cite you two examples:
---
&gt;But you hit the end game and you can't do anything as well as other classes.  
---
I am a druid main in retail for like 8 years but I value group play and raiding so I won't be playing druid.  
---
&gt;Fun yea but its pretty objectively one of the weaker classes.
---
Then, because YOU don't like the evidence, you change the definition of hate:  
---
&gt; Hating does not = founded criticism.... 
---
I think that definition is both problematic and not what most people define it as, and I gave you examples of why that doesn't work, I then point specifically to WHY that definition doesn't work, and I ask you a question: 
---
&gt;Let's say you told someone who is really ugly that they're ugly. Or if you told someone who was really stupid that they're an idiot. Or that you told someone really weak that they're weak.  
---
&gt;**Can you not see how at a certain point that could be hateful? Especially if they weren't asking for criticism at the time.**
---
You fail to answer my question. 
---
 
---
&gt;It's a thread about druids. Someone stated a fact about them.  
---
&gt;If they said druids are useless or cant heal that's lying. Saying druids are a weaker class isnt lying or hateful. They are.
---
I state the question again:
---
&gt;So then we're back at our original point of contention:  
---
&gt;Let's say you told someone who is really ugly that they're ugly. Or if you told someone who was really stupid that they're an idiot. Or that you told someone really weak that they're weak .  
---
&gt;**Can you not see how at a certain point that could be hateful? Especially if they weren't asking for criticism at the time?**
---
You ignore the question, again:
---
&gt;Ugly is one subjective. Calling someone ugly with no context. If the thread is about ugly people and people say something then it's related to the topic.  
---
&gt;This is a thread about druids. They are a weaker class. Healing touch cant out speed priests or paladin heals so they get the heal off faster. Rejuvenate doesnt stack with others meaning only one druid can hot a target which minimize their impact.  
---
&gt;Moonkin is one of the weakest dps. Feral druid while viable arent as strong as other melee class counter parts.  
---
&gt;Druids are a true hybrid. They can do everything but not as well. It isnt subjective like appearance but a truth. This is a topic about druids. So how in the world do you consider stating this hating.
---
I state the question again
---
&gt; Okay lets say you run into someone with dwarfism. Do you think it wouldn't be hurtful to say "hey you're really short", even though it's true that that person is really short? 
---
You, once again, fail to answer the question. Probably because you realize that you don't have a good answer to the question. (That's giving you the benefit of the doubt. There's a chance that you're trolling, in which case I admit I've sort of enjoyed this, or there's the small chance that you really are so dense that you haven't understood the question despite me asking it three times with different examples of what could be hateful truths.)
---
&gt; So in your mind is all truthful criticism hateful? 
---
Your answer is a false dichotomy where either all criticism is hateful or none of it is, so I point that out to you:
---
&gt; There's a major logical difference between "all truthful criticism is hateful" and "some truthful criticism is hateful". I believe the latter. You seem to believe that things that are true cannot be hateful, in other words "no truthful criticism is hateful". If that's not what you believe, then great, I'm glad you're not falling into black and white thinking. But from everything you've said so far, it seems like that's your position. If we can both agree that some truthful criticism can hateful, then there's nothing further to discuss. 
---
You decide that you'd like to move the goalposts again. To recap with where those goalposts started, we started with "people often hate on druids" you demanded evidence from this specific thread (moving the goalposts), I provided it, you redefined the terms of the evidence (moving the goalposts), and now that I've shown you why your redefinition doesn't work, you say well, it's only a small number of the comments here. Which, again, is perfectly reasonable given that we're telling others to ignore those small number of comments. They don't have to be a large number, they just have to be needless complaining about druids. Anyways, so here's you moving the goalposts again:
---
&gt;So in what world is 2 comments in a 70+ comment thread stating druids are a weaker class hateful then when they are a weaker class. How where those two comments shitting on druids and hsting on them. Are those comments truly hateful and considered shitting on the class then?  
---
&gt;Were those two comment so egregious that they qualify as hatred and shitting on?
---
I admit, I am getting somewhat bored of your inability to understand me. So I conclude that this isn't going anywhere. To answer your question, yes they're shitting on druids lol.   
---
&gt; We're obviously getting nowhere here. If you didn't understand me the first three times you're not going to understand me next time either I'm afraid. Enjoy living in your delusion where the world is purely black and white and the truth is always a good, pure, and noble thing. 
---
  
---
But if you want other examples of people seeing this phenomenon in posts about druids, lets look at today's posts, hey, here's one from seven hours ago:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bg456h/so\_much\_hate\_towards\_feral\_druid\_played\_one\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bg456h/so_much_hate_towards_feral_druid_played_one_the/)   
---
Like, seriously, at this point if you think there's nobody hating on druids, and that everyone saying that there's people hating on druid is a liar, what chance do I have to convince you otherwise? You're SO convinced that you're right, despite me providing evidence to the contrary every time you've asked, that you're clearly too stubborn to ever change your mind (or you're trolling, or you're too stupid. Once again, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you're just stubborn). 
---
So this will be the end of my posts here. I feel I've done my due diligence, and if you're going to continue in your world where you're right and everyone else is wrong, I won't stop you.
---
I'm sure I read somewhere that Female Dwarf Rogue was the least common combination - can't remember if that was Vanilla or retail though
---
this might help too

id recommend going for 50 base stats, youtube some guides on the skills and there will be some quests to help skip a few levels (30 levels in some cases). OSRS definitely gets funner the more things you unlock to do
---
flair doesn't check out
---
I think I was following the optimal quest order guide, and I did Waterfall quest so I'm at least 30 in combat skills.

Right.  If you’re a tank/dps you better be rich.
---
I just wanna tinker with random builds without giving a kidney

I thought it was going to be a list of alcoholic beverages a Dwarf Priest can drink while reaching 60.

Good post!

The “20 Scarlett Thots” line is great lol

**Warrior Looking For Priest to Duo Hardcore/Speed Level to 60! See Details**
---
I am a hardcore vanilla player that has been playing vanilla private servers for 3.5 years and have cleared all content. I am looking for a similar knowledgeable player that knows their class, and details of leveling as an Alliance Priest. I will be rolling human and you can roll human or dwarf I have planned for either. I have a full weapon and ability progression for warrior and can help you as a priest with yours. I have a full and efficient route from 1-55 for a duo Warrior/Priest, again dwarf or human will work. This will be on a PvP server.
---
I plan to play 30 hours on launch day to get well ahead of the pack then sleep for 8 hours. After that we would just play 19 hours and sleep 5 until 60 which (if done well) would take 4-6 days /played depending on how good we execute the route. I can always work out a different schedule if you have something different in mind. I would also like to practice our route to some extent that way we have a good idea of what we’re doing.
---
Please Friend and pm me on discord Johnnyboy#1880 or Battle.net BabyBob#1661 for more details or interest! Excited to work together all the way to 60!!
---
If you were right, there would be in-game mechanisms preventing killing greys.  It is telling that there aren't.
---
I appreciated this.
---
my original statment still stands. You can and it a fact. I dident say it was good or that you dont need adfons.
---
&gt;But right clicking turns on your melee not autoshot
---
Yep, I remember when they changed it, I accidentally pulled some shit just like the OP picture. I had come back to the game after a long break and needed to toggle it off in some menu.
---
lets be real here its gonna take atleast 7 games of real time before anyone is even atempting a raid on crossroads, when classic releases
---
Actually the shadow fang is still best in slot for 19 warriors. That weapon was ahead of the curve.
---
I ran so many timed strat runs before I finally got mine.
---
Looking for a serious PvP guild on a PvP server that will also raid down the road. I love raiding but I also can't be lvl 60 by day 4 and on 8hours a night to raid. 
---
I definitely want to have a guild that is doing open world PvP, and then Bgs ocne they release.
---
Going Horde, obviously, Forsaken and mostly likely Rogue. Slight chance I do healing Priest instead since they are also fun in raids and Bgs. Maybe an alt.
---
I am not failing to answer the question...  
---
You can be racist and call people black as a derogatory word. If there black then that's true.
---
However, we have someone with 8 years experience with a druid stating the weakness of a druid and that they aren't rolling one.
---
We have someone stating they are a weaker class which is a weakness of the class.
---
If those comments are shitting on and hateful then what's an example of a something critical and not hateful? They arent mutual exclusive.
---
Also when he posted that original comment in this thread about people shitting on druids... those comments did not exist. They were posted 2 hours after that comment. So he posted a comment complaining about people shitting on druids without a single comment created criticizing them. How does that make sense....
---
# 🔥 &lt;Requiem&gt; 🔥
---
Horde |⚔ NA-PvP ⚔| Semi-Hardcore  
---
**Intro:** We started out as a group of friends from the mid-west all jumping back in for Classic. Most are classically trained up to and including MC, ONY, and BWL, with a few who saw AQ40 and NAXX content prior to the release of BC. Many in this group, myself included, have been active across various private servers over the years and are eager to bring our knowledge and experience to the Blizzard stage.  
---
***First and foremost, this will be a Semi-Hardcore Progression/Raiding Guild.*** Our goal is to progress through all Raid content efficiently but without tryharding and sacrificing the fun aspect of playing the game -others have referred to this as relaxed-progression.  
---
Don't let this intimidate you, we understand we're all older now, with families and careers. We're not asking you to put in an extra 40 hours of WoW on top of real world responsibilities. We're also not asking you to give up PVP. And while we'd love to begin progressing through content as soon as possible we understand the level 60 grind, and preparing for raids, takes time and effort.  
---
**What we're focusing on now:** Building a core group of like-minded players who understand the level of effort and coordination behind building a successful raiding guild and have the drive to make it happen in a friendly and laid-back, albeit efficient, environment.  
---
**Expectations:** Be courteous and respectful of all members. No gatekeeping. We don't expect everyone to know strats to every encounter, but if you don't, we will expect that you show up with a positive attitude and a willingness to learn.  
---
**Raid Schedule:** Thursday &amp; Sunday 6:00-9:00 PM PST. As more content becomes available we may add a 3rd day, this is still TBD.  
---
**Discord:** [https://discord.gg/WkmxDEE](https://discord.gg/WkmxDEE)
---
Priest: wand leveling (needs good wands badly), somewhat squishy (not a mage and not a warlock). Very large toolkit for end game healing, can even farm things with holy nova or as one in raid sometimes goes shadow.
---
Druid: fast feral leveling with low downtime. Good healing but HoTS compete with priest HoTS, can also be co/of-tank and somewhat good melee DPS.
---
Shaman: good leveling, relatively low damage taken with a shield. God of utility in raids, chain heals and ST. Somewhat limited by nature damage of elemental and reliant on melee DPS gear for enhancement.
---
Paladin: slow leveling, but can be quite resilient due to plate and o-shit-buttons. Clothadin in raids when healing. Got-tier buff, good healing. Can farm undead as HPala.
---
In short - leveling experience will be quite different from what you will be doing end game and how the class will feel end game. And getting better gear also changes how each class starts to feel.
---
Tauren can indeed use Wolves!
---
I always roll herb/alchemy for my tanks. 
---
Never had any issues
---
Fuckin top notch shit here
---
If someone has to convince you, you probably shouldn't play it.
---
They always wait a month! As per code, fuck you op
---
If you include model, female orc rogue or female troll hunter.
---
Druids aren’t bad Priests though. It fits way better with Rogue because Cat form literally has an Energy bar.
---
Anywhere I can find his talent build?
---
nice!
---
&gt;I currently find playing a priest the least appealing healing class to pick
---
Then don't play it. I'm not being snarky, that's legit advice. Vanilla WoW is a long experience and if you don't like your character, it isn't going to be enjoyable to play. So pick a class that you like, regardless of how it looks on paper.
---
Should be Rogue instead of Priest icon. Druids fulfill other utilities than Priest while Cat form is literally a budget Rogue.
---
Priest: SWP, Mindflay, Mind Blast 
---
Lock: Shadowbolt, Corruption, COE/S/A
---
Mage: Frostbolt | Fireball, Scorch
---
Hunter: Aimed shot, Multishot (+autoshot clipping!)
---
Rogue: SS/Backstab, SnD, Eviscerate
---
Warrior: Bloodthirst, WW, Heroic Strike (sometimes), Execute (sometimes), Slam (alt build)
---
Ret: Judgement, Consecrate, Seal of the Crusader
---
Ele Sham: Lightning Bolt/Chain Lightning
---
Enh Sham: Totems.... and.... stormstrike if you are allowed to use a debuff
---
Feral: shred, shapeshift, ferocious bite
---
Balance: starfire (rarely wrath, rarely moonfire (arguable if its worth the gcd, let alone the debuff slot))
---
No class except for the warrior can boast that their sustain dps rotation is anything more than 3 buttons. 
---
If the question was pvp--obviously there would be more skills. But OP mentioned tanks, which make me assume it was a pve focused question. 
---
But no, I've never played vanilla--good eye.
---
A common goal is B gloves. Failing that start looking into stat requirements for easy/med/hard/elite diary's and quest Cape.
---
That's still got enough sting to get an oof out of me every time it's brought up.
---
[Oof indeed!](https://cdn.glitch.com/8ef35b11-8c6c-44bb-afb4-a38b833d3c8b%2Foofd.png?1529987683042)

---
^(I am a bot. Comment ?stop for me to stop responding to your comments.)
---
I’m gonna agree. There’s some classes that I like the idea of, Hunter and Mage come to mind, but find the play style doesn’t suit me at all.
---
Yesss! That's what I was going for Haha
---
The opposite is true as well, if I get ganked the moment I unstealth then obviously I won't take chances in the future.
---
&gt;Back in 2005? Yeah it was.  
---
&gt;Compared to how people talk in games today? It was unbelievably tame.
---
Wrong.  This really IS rose-tinted goggles.  Barrens chat would make today's players run for a safe space.  &lt;The Nicker&gt; had it's name changed because of all the racist jokes in Barrens chat.  Every server had a guild called {Nagas Stole My Bike}.  Chuck Norris jokes were certainly a large part of Barrens chat, but they were really the only wholesome part of that zone.  Anal \[random ability here\], pseudo-scientific racist bullshit, rampant misogyny, Barrens chat was absolute AIDS.
---
wow, really awesome mage! I've never seem him before. Thanks :)
---
Are pallys good in classic? I remember one friend doing well and the other wasn't. Are you going healer
---
it's straightforward. you either heal faces in dungeons and raids or melt faces as shadow in pvp. some of these other healing classes have insane decision trees to cope with. priests are simple.
---
This is a really good point. Are you mostly concerned with leveling, raiding or WPVP, battlegrounds etc. Original poster may want to roll on an instant lv60 PS and try out different classes. Thats what I did and nothing beats Priest for me.
---
honestly 20-29 is much better. it allows like 4 more classes to play (mage/druid/sham)
---
I never see any Tauren Warriors around.
---
Dont want to get ganked?
---
Roll on a pve server.
---
Oh, you want to gank others but not get ganked yourself? 
---
Play a single player rpg on ezmode. 
---
Dont know what else to tell you, if you want to be able to gank others, others will be able to gank you. If you dont like the idea that on a pvp server some twat could be hiding in a Bush somewhere, 40 levels higher than you, waiting to ambush some unsuspecting lowbies, or that there could even be a group of players your level or below, hunting members of a different faction, is that unsettling to you... just roll on a pve server. 
---
Everyone else either doesnt mind or doesnt care or enjoys it, etc. 
---
That's why we play on pvp servers on an older version of the game with a lot of world pvp. If it's not for you, its not for you. Dont fuck it up for the rest of us. Go to a pve server
---
Depends on the BG I think. Alliance have the upper hand on WSG with paladins for defending. While horde has the upper hand in AB since it's harder to just sit on defence.
---
yes for sure 
---
we don't do a lot of burst damage and you kinda have accept the role of a support tank- in PvP I can take a lot of heat and keep healing.  
---
in Pve imo paladins are the best healers, flash of light is OP and as your toolkit builds you become more and more powerful. I never have mana issues 
---
Ret is okay but if you wanna deal burst damage then imo you'll be let down
---
Mages are weird. I got more random Int buffs leveling rogue and warrior than I did all the mana dependent classes I leveled.
---
There is at least one PTR realm on one of PServers so it's definitely a way to try it out. One thing to keep in mind - start undergeared and then move to like T1/T2 and epic loot. The more class is gear dependent the bigger the difference will be and the later in Classic /played you will get that gear.
---
Hi OP. 
---
The vast majority of my play time during vanilla was lvl 19 twinks.
---
I had a fully twinked 19 warrior, hunter, and Druid. 
---
I was one of the first in the world to have the +10 stamina off hand on my Druid.
---
I can say without a doubt it’s hunter. They’re very strong and can basically kite forever at that level.
---
If you’re looking to just fuck around in BG’s that’s the class you should pick to feel the strongest. Plus the gear is actually very cheap compared to the other classes.
---
Rogues and warriors are tied in my mind, they both do something similar and are specialized. Warrior was my first twink and I never felt lacking DPS wise. Charge was super handy. 
---
Priests were the only healers worth bringing on the alliance side imo. They’re basically great offensively and defensively. Solid pick and good at everything. 
---
Druids are super crucial because your only BG is WSG. It was very difficult to gear. The hardest is the fishing helmet from the STV tourney. Very hard to complete and you soak a ton of XP doing it so it has to be done really low level. This shouldn’t be your first twink. 
---
Mages were glass canons with a lot of control. Very fun in and out play style but you need to hang out next to hunters and priests. Not as dominate in random Q’s but they’re amazing in premades.
---
Locks are very much the same as mages. Very similar roll, imo they were worse at it. The extra survivability means nothing to a rogue or warrior. Especially as alliance against the undead they were rough.
---
Pallies sort of sucked. Shamans never felt difficult to play against as ally but there were a lot of them so they could be good.

I prefer PvE 5 man and raiding. I only pvp occasionally. One consideration I have thought about was farming for raids, which used to be a pain on my healing druid way back when.
---
Alliance.
---
I don't know, it seems a bit high. Did you include plate repair cost in that calculation?
---
Yep, I've definitely had that issue. That's actually part of the reason my alt is going to be a warlock this time around. I tried one in vanilla and it just didn't work for me. Wondering if it will be different 14 years later. Still love the idea. 
---
I also kinda want to have a minor RP with a pair of brothers who died and came back as undead, one holy priest and one shadowy warlock.
---
PvP. But we are emphasising PvE in the guild. We like to PvP but need that end game gear for it.
---
Thanks, that is actually a great breakdown! I remember most hots being wasted by other healers not taking them into account when doing their direct healing.
---
There is an Auction House in each major city.  talk to an Auctioneer and select the "Auction"  tab,  then drag the item you want to sell in to the item slot and type in the price you want to put the item up for.
---
the item will stay up for 8+ hours  or until somebody buys the item.
---
If nobody buys the item it will be sent to your mailbox if the auction time runs out
---
If anyone's interested, I re-uploaded mine from back then on patch 1.11 I think

Unfortunatelly one of the songs got muted :(
---
Pretty much any F2P game with a global chat channel has the same atmosphere as Barrens Chat. It's nothing special anymore.
---
Yeah I’m gonna be Holy Priest, apparently running high end dungeons or raids on farm is the way to go and you can just buy your mats. You may know better than me I never raided in vanilla. I’ll be taking Tailoring/Enchanting so gathering just isn’t an option unless I level an alt.
---
Cat form is not a budget rogue.
---
Outland is technically Draenor after it was destroyed, so Arre is right. And you say you're a wow fan? suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuure buddy...
---
Awesome, thanks a lot!
---
As a priest I would rather convince you to play tank
---
Very good
---
Not sure if i can make a claim for hunter having the steepest curve. But an honorable mention nonetheless. Further more, while leveling a hunter is easy compared to most other classes. It's actually pretty difficult to master. There are simply more resources to manage and master, more than a novice hunter would think.
---
So you're obviously managing your health and mana, your pets health and your pets focus. Since you are controlling the position of your hunter, and your pet, and you have a certain degree of control over who has aggro. There are ways to optimize the amount of damage your pet takes, thus the amount of downtime requires between mobs. A true master hunter, in addition to managing the hunter and the pets resources, will take advantage of another resources some hunters seldom use.
---
Hunters can actually auto attack with their melee weapon, and auto attack with their ranged weapon on separate cool downs. Master hunters have been experimenting with leveling survival talents for +20% raptor strike crit chance, before going beast mastery talents. Combined with a slow weapon, the hunter can take maximum advantage of both melee auto attack and ranged auto attack. The slower the weapons, the easier it is to manage.
---
A novice hunter will hit level 60 in a respectable time. But if you're a master hunter, managing your resources with excellence. It will add up.
---
I will be somewhat similar to this method with my priest when I level.
---
Spirit Tap -&gt; Wand Damage -&gt; Improved SW Pain -&gt; ....
---
Thinking of going the rest into Disc after that. Using the extra mana regen and lowered mana costs to help with the downtime. Will also be running as many dungeons as possible. Originally I leveled from 58 to 60 completely from dungeons.
---
As long as you keep up to date with your wand then you are good to go. Just keep Pain active, Mind Blast when you can, and wand like theres no tomorrow. From what I remember reading wanding is better than shadow spec until you reach like level 45 or so.
---
raid at work
---
We’ve all been there. What happens in Goldshire Inn stays in Goldshire Inn amiright.
---
I leveled as pure holy on a PvP server in vanilla and I'm going to do it again in Classic. I don't know about the stats you ask about, but the only unpleasantness in world PvP was the same ganking that would occur no matter what class you are. Healers in world PvP are a ton of fun. Sure, you'll have a hard time taking out people on your own, but healing friendlies changes the dynamic of fights so much. I distinctly remember keeping a group of lower level characters alive while they warred against a couple of 60s (I want to say my fellow Hordies were in their low- to mid-50s). We won a fight that I couldn't have won alone and where the lowbies wouldn't have had a chance without help.
---
&gt; You can be racist and call people black as a derogatory word. If there black then that's true. 
---
Yes, and it can also be hateful. 
---
&gt;If those comments are shitting on and hateful then what's an example of a something critical and not hateful? They arent mutual exclusive.
---
It's critical and not hateful when the criticism is beneficial to people. A good way to know for sure that it'll be beneficial is when people ask for criticism or constructive feedback. This really isn't as complicated as you're trying to make it. 
---
&gt;Also when he posted that original comment in this thread about people shitting on druids... those comments did not exist. They were posted 2 hours after that comment. So he posted a comment complaining about people shitting on druids without a single comment created criticizing them. How does that make sense....
---
Jesus Christ, once again you're STILL moving the goalposts lol? 
---
The reason he said that was because it happens every thread man, that's why it's so predictable. 
---
Now, can we just move on?
---
340, but you dont cap yourself for all bosses, just a few of them that hits like a truck
---
And Bear form is not a budget Warrior yet we make the comparison.
---
Feign death + Shadowmeld can be useful in PvP.
---
they all can lose to druid in pvp except priest
---
Okay this is what I'm thinking to help make gold at the start and possibly switch to engi if I hate aoe threat, since sappers are only 205.
---
glacial stone for ally is BiS, night reaver for horde.  for 2handers anyways..
---
Hahahaha logic
---
Belly bulge vs crotch bulge
---
Pvp feels more immersive in that the alliance vs horde feels like a significant part of the game rather than an opt in secondary mechanic. All about preference.
---
I recently learned that fishing is actually a decent way to farm gold as well. In my experience raiding can be more expensive than running 5 mans can easily recoup. Unless people pay you to heal in their group?
---
Female nelf for the front flip jumps. Absolute game changer.
---
I was heavy into Runescape before WoW. I’m currently really into OSRS. History is repeating itself.

I only twinked a little back in vanilla, but I don't fully remember much about priests. Db shows it is 18 for both factions tho

If you help me level, I might consider it :)

Is it possible for a lvl 60 friend to power level an alt?
---
excuse me what the fuck
---
Shaman beg to differ
---
Since you're a warrior I see why you're saying that as its the easiest class ever to fight against as mage, BUT we do have our weaknesses (against other classes)
---
i was a rank 13 feral druid and literally couldnt die in duels. you can go indefinitely against every class
---
I did it because it was a quest and I finished all quests in vanilla that were available to my class/race/profession combo. Literally never wore it.
---
Just avoid fighting people or group up with others, you will be fine.
---
I'm impressed
---
Its whichever is the furthest from where your corpse, mobs, quest turn ins, and next hub are*
---
They are actually one of the most common combos because that’s the only option. So even though there’s a lot of warriors, because they are split between every race a “Tauren Druid” is much more common than an “tauren warrior”.
---
The biggest problem is the cost of respeccing, which quickly raises to 50 gold (as a reference, thats the average amount of gold you can farm in one hour).
---
The only class able to heal in raids and tank 60 dungeons, without respeccing constantly, would be a Holy Paladin specced for Blessing of Sanctuary (picking up relevant tanking talents on the way). It won't be pretty, and your healing in raids will suffer (~15%), but tanking dungeons works if you strap on the correct gear.
---
Also Druids are not weak healers, don't know who said that. Blessings may guarantee Paladins several raidspots, while Priests are extremely versatile and never wrong to bring, but Druid healing is good and wanted.
---
and then you get to enjoy hazing the new ones yourself
---
No thanks, we're firm on PvE.
---
Soulshards.
---
Goal post.... that is the goal of the thread. He complained about something that didn't happen and I called him out on it. Those comments didn't exist.
---
We can argue about opinions but the is the fact on you know.... the entire thread chain.
---
Additionally, I dont see those comments as shitting on because they weren't extreme enough to warrant  hatred. You see it as hatred. I dont. They just pointed at faults to me.
---
300 base at level 60, up to +10 from warrior talent Anticipation, and probably another 170 or so you could get from gear and enchants if that’s all you stacked, depending on the era of vanilla. But you are crit immune by L63s (raidboss level) once you hit 440 defense (often called the defcap) so the cost/benefit analysis probably never cuts in favor of going beyond 440, although additional defense beyond that level does continue to increase parry and block chance.
---
The uninformed make the comparison
---
I had a female troll shaman.
---
I read that 440 was that cap but didn't think 1.12 era WoW could get anywhere near there.
---
If you wan't to be a damage dealing spellcaster, than Mage or Warlock are both awesome!
---
Shadow Priests can be great in PvP but not very good in raids.  so in raids you will be expected to be holy or Discipline specialization to heal people
---
Was earlier than you think in classic,  patch 1.6, bwl patch
---
Post up in Blackrock Mountain or some other high up area. Mind Control. *Laugh in Priest*
---
I never did end game Vanilla so I had no idea. You talking BWL and up or even some in MC you'd want 340?
---
This is great. We certainly need more of these for the other classes
---
Kinda want them gone lol but no changes
---
Extremely broad question. While most PvE specs are quite rigid, alot of DPS classes have several viable specs. For the Hybrid classes, Paladins and Shaman only heal, Priests heal and can DPS (limited to 1 spot per raid), Druids heal and very rarely 1 Feral tank/dps.
---
Harlan is such a joke... sad!
---
I didnt realize that this was what i wanted in a guild until I read it.
---
So many guilds want to raid until midnight on weekdays.
---
I'll be playing a warlock and druid on alliance pvp, so I'll seek you guys out once July rolls around!
---
Someone doesn’t get sarcasm lol
---
seems like a designer could lift hearthstones border/fonts/framework for the aesthetic design. Borrow hearthstone art etc. basically a lot of copyright infringement. If only blizzard could work with you somehow and allow it.
---
That seems to be a very popular part of being a priest. Hahaha
---
I'm not sure how I feel about them, as yes it was amazing the tm v southshore fights due to everyone waiting there to que, but on the other hand it did mean more bgs, especially in the next patch, 1.7, when you got ported back to battlemaster after each bg to que again. So you could go do stuff while waiting. 
---
It also meant most pvpers where in there, so we all got to know each other after seeing the same faces,
---
How I got into the horde high warlord premade, just chatting everyday, and having bwl / aq 40 purples
---
Friend is going to go Warlock.
---
I am new to the game, but I was thinking of going shadow priest to buff damage/heal/synergy but he says I should go Paladin. I feel like his pet will be tanky enough for us to duo most PvE leveling content, but our aim is level 60 content. I am going to Reddit for help. 
---
What is the best class to complement a Warlock for endgame content?
---
What DPS addon is that?
---
Sounds good; hit me up when you know for sure what you wanna play and stuff and we can chat.
---
Pally is probably the most fun since youre both melee classes and you can fight side by side. Id also say its the better PvP combo. On the flip side having a ranged class for variance might be a bit more practical.
---
For questing, with Pally, youll both run in side by side and attack mobs, pally heals as needed. With Priest, the Warrior charges in and Priest supplies a bit of wand damage. Either works for dungeons, but Pally is more difficult, if your friend is good it shouldnt make a difference though
---
Yeah.  While I agree with the sentiment that grey killing should be fought (by players, not blizzard changing anything), I feel you’re absolutely correct.
---
Now this dude gets hundred of upvotes. This sub is garbage in terms of reposts, or posting the same style thing over and over. Love the game, love the community, but this sub sometimes...
---
What the fuck is an Ench shamans ?
---
I need this game in my veins so bad. I've been waiting to go back to Vanilla since TBC.
---
Goodluck!
---
From my understanding so far, Mages are good at direct damage while Warlocks are good at dmg over time. Why are priests good with dmg at pvp but not with raids?
---
 As a game, it's actually not that bad, but when it comes to the other souls game, yeah its the worst in the series
---
When your raid decides to delay the Bwl run for 30 minutes just to prevent the Alliance weaklings from getting to the zone. Then you'll understand.
---
If it's Priest or Pally, then Priest for the simple reason that you won't be competing for loot.
---
The Paladin would still be Retribution with a Twohander, only swapping in some int gear if he or she enters a dungeon as healer.
---
General playstyle doesn't change much, except that the Warrior will have no / little downtime and you can take on groups of mobs, not just one at a time.
---
ya but we are now in a world (of warcraft) where they try selling heroic runs
---
It was something to do but I don't remember the rewards being that amazing.
---
Haha yeah it's considerably worse.
---
I did! My rogue still has her full set of Darkmantle armor. 
---
I remember being in charge of pulling the mobs for my group's 45m Baron run. The day we finally got him down in time was one of my favorite moments in the game. Can't wait to do it all over again!!
---
Yeah no.
---
Depends what you mean by endgame content, as that usually means either raiding or PvP. Theres no real 2 class synergy in raids, as all classes are needed. For dungeons as well, i wouldnt say theres any real synergy except a healer/tank, Warlock doesnt cut it for level 60 dungeons as a tank though. If youre talking farming, id say Hunter because the Hunter can kite and the lock can be extra DPS or Mage to double up on AoE.
---
For PvP, hes probably right, Paladin would probably help you out best.
---
[removed]
---
Thx man :)
---
As someone considering leveling engineering at 60 ... everyone please ignore this person.
---
They're is less fem taurens then fem orcs.
---
Yeah, skinning is almost always for vendoring. But that's the point. It's a few seconds that adds extra value to a large number of mobs. No hunting down nodes and no AH fees.
---
Hade a 60 dwarf hunter on retail 2005 and on a priv server. Going to roll a new one this server.
---
Dwarves, the master race!
---
So I actually like it as well. As others have said, it provides a sort of PvP ecosystem where ganking leads to counterganking and spontaneous WPvP encounters.
---
But another reason I like greygankers is that dying to one always motivated me to level up faster. Sure, sometimes they would camp you and you’d have to log for a bit or find a clever escape route, but it left me with a certain survival drive that made the long grind to 60 more purposeful. You knew and could feel that you were progressing to be able to win that encounter one day.
---
When learning bosses in early wow we had a out of combat paladin rezzer (he got to buff before fights too, was a fulfilling role)
---
I remember it clearly on Magmadar for those feared into fire or just those who camped in it.
---
Why? Bloke I’ll sell you 1-300 engineering for 200g.
---
You can farm that in four to six hours if you’re not a retard vs gathering all that shit yourself
---
upvote for aboriginal gear
---
We will probably only do PvE dungeons/raids. So I guess I’ll rephrase my question. If you were running one of those and a warlock joined your party, what class would you seek out/desire the most to also join?
---
idk why trolls are least played.. i think male troll priests look sick
---
Didnt knew that. And it raises a new problem. How are they going to balance server pop at launch ?
---
Ah, misread your original post. My bad.
---
I was very spoiled and was in a guild that raided so my Hunter was all decked out in gear much better than the second dungeon set. I hope I can make use of it as a form of endgame goal for my Priest in Classic!
---
Rogue/hunter were certainly on top, mainly because they have the best gear by a long shot. Bears are ok but have almost no abilities. Priests were basically only popular because someone needed to heal the Hunters and Rogues.
---
Im surprised at some of the 19 Warrior fans here. A 19 Hunter twink can LITERALLY outmelee a Warrior at 19.
---
I remember the biggest hits you could get at level 19 were Raptor Strike crits from Twisted Chanter Staff
---
Which is the other reason why I instagank them.
---
Can't comment on Lock, but will take a stab at the Rogue questions.  (Pun intended)  
---
Best pvp spec can vary depending on access to gear, but hemo is generally regarded as the overall best.  Can be any weapon, there are no sword specific talents involved.  So any good, slow mace or fist weapon would also work in the MH.  There are a couple hybrid builds using daggers and backstab getting Imp Sprint in Combat used by those lucky enough to bag a Felstriker.
---
Basic opener in pvp is almost always Cheap Shot.  Garrote does not get its silence until TBC.  Rotation is situational, but usually want to gouge and restealth and reapply Cheap Shot.  Spec gives you good control.
---
Rogues are extremely desirable for groups and raids, as they are generally 2nd best damage class behind Fury Wars, and require minimal upkeep.  
---
The biggest challenges to mastering a Rogue in pvp is situational awareness, and the ability to think a few moves ahead and not panic was something doesn't go as planned.  You have a lot of tools to escape and reset an encounter that isnt going your way.  And ping.  Oh so much ping lol.  Anything over 150ms and I'd recommend a caster or hunter.
---
They are a ton of fun, I mained one in Vanilla and another in the private server scene.
---
"Spins like a dreidel"
---
xD
---
Furry art lol
---
RfD and fire cape will keep you busy for a while. Just make small goals with a bigger picture in mind. Another good start to have is to get easy and medium diaries done for their various and extremely useful rewards.
---
yeah
---
well thats just another pserver database. but if you click on the alliance quest you can see it has a prequest. that quest requires lvl20.
---
Rogues bring innervate? 3% group crit? Motw? Thorns? 
---
Cat Druids are cat Druids. Not budget rogues.
---
Any feral worth his or her salt plays to the strength of the class.
---
Druids don’t bring disarm trap. 
---
Shock horror.
---
Go back to your basement.
---
I really wish you wouldn’t think less of me.  It means a lot for you think better of who I am.
---
So play a pve server instead of crying about your choice to play pvp.
---
Thankyou kind sir.
---
Should I disregard synergy and go pure tank or healer or other?
---
I don’t have any experience in raids to know what is most desired.
---
Huh? with 5%HP racial Tauren warriors were the most popular main tanks, at least on the servers i've played on in vanilla.
---
I can't wait!
---
I remember running around IF as a new 60 in vanilla and this pally in full Soulforge rolls up next to me and I'm like 'damn'. 
---
Some of the .5 sets just looks incredible, IE Priest and Pally ETC
---
why am I getting downvoted for no changes? I am admitting I rather have no changes then something I like?
---
&gt;I got someone banned for saying did your dad rape you because I was hating on the content of the video. You can even see it because the mods made a note on it. Someone said that to me. I think that was shitty.
---
That was shitty. I'm sorry you had to go through that. 
---
Why can two things not be shitty at the same time?

Rogue is stealthed. Which it's why it isn't depicted.

Priest solo leveling isn't bad. A lot of wand spamming but not bad speed wise.
---
You can just kill swamp jaguars from lvls 37 - 40 for 100g
---
easy to level
---
best healer for 5 mans, high demand for raids
---
great tier sets (at least T2 up, most class T1 is not very good)
---
awesome class epic from MC
---
I had to walk away from OSRS, it’s a dangerous thing
---
Which is pretty funny considering that Dwarf is probably the best race for rogue pvp-wise on alliance. Of course, nothing beats human for pve.
---
I guess you have to play Alliance to get this one?
---
Again for raids, youre looking for consistent numbers of each class, so if someones a Warlock that means theres 1 less Warlock spot, so the only class to not play would be Warlock as that means theres already 1 fewer Warlock spot.
---
As I said before, theres not much 2 class synergy in dungeons. You could be a Warrior to tank as theyre in the highest demand, but this would be simply to leverage your value as a tank to insist your Warlock friend also be part of the group.
---
Priest is the strongest class in premade pvp
---
That is strange, but classes with no mana benefit from int a small amount, your weapon skills go up slightly faster.
---
People are petty and dumb, that's why.
---
Some guy thought it would be cool if he could use the race specific totem graphics.  Anyone who agreed also got downvoted.  
---
Yesterday they were chain downvoting people who suggested they liked the *option* of using more modern graphics.  No one was saying to force it on you, but having the option was just too much for these clowns.
---
tl;dr - The internet is full of jerks.
---
this is going to blow your mind but when people say "cats are budget rogues" they're referring to CATS, try to wrap your head around that concept before you respond to me again champ
---
1.6, I also had a slight preference for when they weren't in classic. They're pretty much an early version of dungeon finder, but for battlegrounds. Though it was tolerable until they introduced XRBGs.
---
You’re so basic and it shows.
---
Gotta be honest, I forgot about old SM. So much more hyped for classic now holy shit
---
Female orc rogue is bis
---
I got atal'ai gloves of fiery wrath in my mage's first ST run at like level 49. +38 fire damage (9 spell damage plus 27 fire). Better than MC gloves, arguably better than netherwind lol
---
I said exactly that. It's your insinuation that "2004 audiences" were a bit simple that I wanted to refute. The year has nothing to do with it.
---
from my experience, there is one class that gets ganked the least and thats priest. people simply don't see holy priests as a threat to themselves. people tend to kill the rogue if they see them, simply to get the opener and kill them before they kill you. a holy priest doesn't pose any real threat when alone and is too easy of a target. rightfully so while leveling, but a full t2 holy/disc priest can be a real pain to bring down. still not a threat coz u can just run away from him.
---
45M Baron was hard but that boss in UBRS was near impossible with non-raid geared people.
---
Can a human warrior head over to gnome starting area at lvl 1 without missing any must do quests or anything?
---
Also how about a NE Druid, how long until they can meet up and quest with the other races without missing anything?
---
I gave you very simple instructions and you disappointed yet again.
---
*shudders* i will be skipping this in classic except for the class quest (probably released when im already 60). Those dragonkin pulls on the lower level are impossible to pull single packs.
---
Thank you, I liked the post! I will be dotting up every horde I see while leveling 😈
---
That’s good to know. I managed to get ‘Salty’ on my old main on retail so fishing is right up my alley.
---
ardent custodian has armor on it. any armor from gear (weapon included) is multiplied by the bear form multiplier while in bear form.  This makes weapons with armor most valuable to druids.
---
Runs with friends are great,  but once you are fully comfortable with your keybinds and toolkit , the good practice is that run full of potatoes.   
---
Tank doesn't own a shield,  the Hunter pet is on auto taunt,  and the mage wants to burst like it's  WSG.  This is when being the healer is most fun.  Making success with scenarios that normally should be catastrophic failures.  
---
Best of luck
---
By the time it came out, I already had better gear so there wasn't much point.
---
I would guess June so blizz can have a head start in boosting their next quarterly earnings.
---
First of all you don’t give me instructions.
---
Second your statement is asinine and disingenuous. Reducing cat Druids to their dps contribution (which you are doing when you say they’re budget rogues) is your feeble attempt to prove yourself right, making you look like a basic bitch.
---
They didn't crack down on it for like 6 months, more than enough time to fund all of vanilla for multiple characters.
---
For how useful this could be, I'm honestly surprised I have never seen one and never even thought about the idea of a map like this.
---
They aint even squishy once they got ice barrier. Absorbs giving 0 rage sucks so bad.
---
Honestly playing a healer feels pretty laid back a lot of the time. I remember someone describing healing as extreme boredom with periods of absolute panic, and I think that sums it up. But that's part of the thrill, when you're just healing some mediocre damage and then someone accidentally pulls a second pack of mobs and you have to pull out all the stops to keep the group alive. It's a very satisfying feeling when you manage to pull your group through it.
---
What’s a good duo to pair with a mage? warrior or Druid?
---
Farm it how ?
---
Nah most of them guys are paladin
---
well [joana's guide](https://www.joanasworld.com/horde-1-12-durotar.html) has a few spirit res' that save a heap of travel time. Maybe look at the other starting zone ones and see if they suit you.
---
&gt;First of all you don’t give me instructions.
---
I've seen your reading comprehension up to this point and yet I'm still somehow surprised. 
---
&gt;try to wrap your head around that concept before you respond to me again champ
---
We can both see here that I very clearly just did. 
---
&gt;Second your statement is asinine and disingenuous.
---
It's not. 
---
&gt;Reducing cat **Druids** to their dps contribution
---
Since you're really struggling and I actually really pity you I'm going to point out where you're getting confused. No one said cat DRUIDS, people said CATS. You know, in isolation. In a vacuum. Have you heard of those phrases before? It means to remove the additional context. I know you need the extra help so there you go. 
---
&gt;is your feeble attempt to prove yourself right, making you look like a basic bitch.
---
hurrdurr these posts have all been 3 sentences long max and I just caaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan't keep up!
---
Okay good stuff, thank you.
---
Don't be sad, it's a miracle we get it at all!
---
i had a 19 troll hunter.  twisted chanter's staff, venomstrike. would 1 shot people all the time.  Was so good.  Hunters are pretty broken at 19.  Like some other people said 29 is much better with many other classes having more of their toolkit.
---
*as long as they have full consumables and use more Mana pots than the healers.
---
You missed that end bit.
---
It was explained to me by a priest friend as 'Reverse DPS'.  
---
I rolled a shaman shortly after and enjoyed it with that mindset.
---
What zone?
---
*\*cries in scriptcraft\**
---
Shadow Priest run out of mana very quickly in raids
---
they are strong in PvP because they can melt people down with their damage over time spell, while absorbing damage with their shield spell and healing abilities
---
Fight Arena, Tree Gnome Village, Dragon Slayer 1
---
Swamp of Sorrows
---
Once you hit Ungoro Crater you can do the quest for Linkens boomerang. A range pull trinket with a chance to disarm  or stun. I was glad to have it on my paladin. The quest involves quite a bit of travel and personally l would only do it again if l was playing a pally.
---
I'm with this guy. Why play something if it's not fun? If you want to heal, pallies, druids, and shaman are all viable and with different feels. I loved pally heals because of the crit healing dynamic. Made them feel very different from priests.
---
Male orc warriors, female human warriors, female human rogues, male UD rogues, male UD mages, female nelf huntards. Most popular for sure
---
Warlocks are in demand for dungeons and raid groups because of summoning, soul stones, health stones and curses that increase Mage DPS. Late game they do good damage because they scale well, but their DPS is kinda meh early on.
---
Managing your pet isn't too bad, you can control it with macros fairly well. I prefer to have my pet attack on mousewheel up and pet follow on mousewheel down and put it on passive. Macro the abilities like Felhunter's Devour Magic and you'll be fine.
---
In PvP they require a bit of finesse. A lot of it comes down to choosing the right pets. Fel domination will make it easier to switch pets mid fight. Engineering always gives you an edge, as it does for every other class.
---
I wanted to, as a 9 year old  shadowcraft looked cool asf
---
I might be high as a kite rn, but this picture has me dying atm just because it’s so fucking true
---
Answer the question godammit! ;)
---
I'm probably the odd man out on this one, but I don't necessarily consider an opportunistic kill (or two) as ganking. Even with a substantial level disparity, that's just PvP.
---
After the third kill, though; yeah, dude's a dick.
---
...unless he sticks around once the cavalry arrives. I can respect a man who's just trying to pick a fight, even if he's doing it by ganking me.
---
If he runs away as soon as someone who can actually kill him shows up he gets added to my camping list. Something something revenge something something cold.
---
Incidentally, I intend to turn on the flags all my characters as soon as they're in the game and never turn 'em off again. Sure, it'll probably result in a few more corpse runs, but that's all part of the fun.
---
Never seen someone sharing leveling gear ideas, except wands and weapons :(
---
I just know you’re an edgelord freshman who mains a UD mage with engineering. Arrogance oozes from you, only outdone by your astounding ignorance.
---
No, little fella, I was clearly stating that you do not give me instructions. We’re both guys on a game forum, slow your roll. 
---
“It’s not”. Cool retort lmao. 
---
Finally, this game doesn’t exist in a vacuum.
---
The Druid, will have buffed with motw and thorns, and when he transforms, gosh, gives a 3% crit buff. 
---
And it’s obvious you can’t keep up.
---
Kill stuff. Sell stuff.
---
the thing is though, at the 39 bracket you don't have dire bear form yet.  regular "bear form" is only 120% armor increase (meaning 220 armor total from the weapon while in bear form) , while dire bear from (learned at level 40) is a 370% armor increase (470 armor total from the weapon while in dire bear form).  I'm not sure if it'd be worth it to use that weapon at 39.
---
Not Vanilla, but during TBC, me and my real life friends would group up and go raid Crossroads fairly often.  Eventually Horde 70s would show up and we'd fight, then eventually they'd outnumber us, then it became a matter of being able to rez and run away.  Sometimes they'd chase us all the way through The Barrens.
---
Good times.  My most treasured memories of WoW.  PvE server.  That's what /join WorldDefense is for.
---
That said, I'll probably roll on a PvP server this time myself.
---
Yikes.
---
If I had to take the guess the racials of the other races are more appealing.
---
What exactly do you have to do to be successful as feral in 40 mans. I've heard they can be but I've never seen it.
---
You could in vanilla, but exp sharing/tagging is something that could easily be different in the new engine so we'll have to wait and see exactly how it works.
---
Do you find this to be true?
---
Elemental shaman have strong LHW spam, interrupts, and quick effective burst damage.
---
Hpaly has bubble, quick heals, freedom.
---
Priests are great too with fears, quick healing, and shields. 
---
None of the three really seem to have out-valued the others in my experience. (Not trying to ignore druids, they have their roles, but their actual healing is quite slow in pvp)
---
Surely you can see why cats are called budget Rogues. Energy bar? Check. Stealth mechanics? Check. Combo points &amp; finishers? Check. They use the same tools but they’re not Rogues. Same with Bear form. Rage bar? Check. Enrage? Check. Charge mechanic? You bet. Budget Warrior. I’m not saying Feral Druids are inherently worse, but 99% of players would rather have a Warrior tank over a Druid tank. A Rogue DPS over a Feral DPS. Why? Because they are better at what they do most of the time. Mediocre Rogues CAN get out-DPS’d by excellent Feral Druids. But an excellent Feral Druid can never out-DPS an above-average Rogue.
---
Mages of all stripes get shit on by warlocks, shamans, and hunters.
---
&gt;Druid: fast feral leveling with low downtime. Good healing but HoTS compete with priest HoTS, can also be co/of-tank and somewhat good melee DPS.  
---
I keep hearing wildly different opinions on the viability of druids in various roles lol
---
hey its me ur brother
---
doubly true this time around. Since anyone and everyone who rolls a rogue is doing so for pvp reasons.
---
Yeah I meant like soft cap not max. Thanks for stating it correctly.
---
Why do you all insist on DPS being the be all end all?
---
What has sharing a resource system with a pure class have to do with anything. Are elemental shaman budget mages?
---
When you say something is “budget” you are implying that something is intrinsically an inferior choice. 
---
I never said feral Druids out DPS rogues and I never said they can keep up. From a DPS perspective, you would not be stacking feral Druids. From a raid utility pov, you might have one or two, at most. 
---
I said that cat Druids are not budget rogues. And that’s the truth. The cat Druid still brings all the same buffs and utility.
---
It is overly simplistic to reduce “cat” Druids to their DPS.
---
All the viable feral specs are true hybrid specs regardless and will be more than suitable to offtank.
---
Priests are great because of dispel
---
If you wanna play warlock and pvp you should 100% go horde, take that into consideration as Will of the forsaken/UD make ally locks less viable in PvP.
---
Ok?
---
Yeah...not crying. I’ll be well beyond 40 doing important things by the time this happens. Have fun at 45 while I’m cleaning MC and doing actual pvp in Warsong.
---
If you can find some people who arent potatoes you can just chain run dungeons with them for pretty good exp. it wont be the fastest but youll get some decent gear, and wont have to worry about being ganked other than getting to the dungeon. Youll also avoid areas being overfarmed in the first wave of people leveling. Going to be a lot of waiting for respawns for a lot of people.
---
I think they'll be profitable, but nothing like the insanity that a mafia and extremely large population with a "min-max" attitude will cause. I wonder if control of that level will be established again.
---
For graphics and RP, thats all you.
---
For Racials, theyre honestly one of the most equal splits in terms of class/race combos. In PvE, gun skill is pretty irrelevent, NEs have a marginally larger base Agility while Dwarves have Stoneform for occasional poison and bleed fights.
---
For PvP, Stoneform is an awesome anti Rogue ability and can actually win you the fight and Rogues are a class you generally have trouble with. Shadowmeld however is also excellent for Hunters and allows you to ambush others very easily. While the nerf doesnt let you get the full Aimed shot cast off, it still lets you get the jump on people. A Hunter that opens with an Aimed Shot will win like 90% of the time. The disadvantage is obviously that you have to wait to ambush people, but it provides you an enormous advantage when they run into you.
---
So its a strong anti-Rogue ability vs amazing ambush and defensive ability.
---
And feather can be just as heavy as iron. Read up before being a smartass, bro.
---
Let's be real: you never got that staff, OP.
---
It's been confirmed during the major panel in November that some addon features will be disabled to preserve the Classic experience.
---
Would be sweet but I don't think anyone has made one. You would need the information directly from the source since making one by manually testing one manually would be agony.
---
Well then Stewie is the rogue that's why you can't see him.
---
Hard in what??
---
Well, FD/SM is still a nice thing to have for solo content. You can essentially corpse hop using them.
---
thats gonna be the next milestone post from me :D

Nothing sucks more than heading out into the world looking for a fight, but every single person you see isn't flagged.  ZzZzZzZ

Anyone who has an interest in wpvp should stay away from pve servers.
---
Daggers are better for pvp while levelling, but swords let you kill mobs faster and you don’t have to hurt your fuckin hand doing the backstab dance
---
The reason why daggers are better for levelling is that your biggest challenge while levelling is mages. Everything else you can kill if you get the jump but mages can insta blink out of your stun. Ambush heavily tilts mage fights in your favour but requires a dagger. 
---
Also if you’re questing with a buddy go daggers 100%
---
aren't they kinda doing progressive itemization? they said something about the items added in 1.10 (a ton of very good new dungeon blues) being held back until phase 5 didn't they or I misunderstood?

Cats are definitely budget Rogues. I just explained why. Elemental Shamans do share mana with mages, but when every class in the game except TWO shares that resource your argument falls flat immediately. A cat and a Rogue not only share the Energy resource, they both use bleeds and combo points. But a Rogue has much more flexibility with that system, so naturally a cat will be looked upon as a... budget Rogue.
---
Btw more DPS = boss dead faster. You seem to have a great deal of difficulty grasping even the simplest of concepts. So I shall leave you at that.
---
If you like healing, they're the most versatile healer and will always be in demand. They have the widest kit of spells: three varieties of standard heal for downranking, a flash heal, a HoT, and a damage shield. Aside from Paladins, they are the most mana-efficient healers in vanilla. That said, they are missing out on a smart heal (Chain Heal is the only one in Vanilla) even though they do get Circle of Healing in BC. 
---
They are just solid as a staple healer with loads of utility: Fortitude is a core buff and Divine Spirit + Shadow Protection are powerful additions. That have plethora or fun flavor/utility abilities that really make the game immersive imo: Mind Vision, Mind Soothe, Levitate, and Mind Control.
---
Finally, their racial spells are really interesting and add depth to your race choice. 
---
While they aren't without problems, unless there's something specific you want out of healing that one of the hybrids provides you can't go wrong with the Priest.
---
Free after a long chain of quests costing almost the same or even more

we need to make them a round head.

four lines should to the trick.
---
I still remember going to an internet cafe with my friends and spending the whole time there running this Dungeons. 
---
The Dragon's Call Dropped and my Friend on his Warrior ALT snagged it from me when I was on my main still grinding for max level... sucked.
---
But normal form literally has a mana bar.
---
whoa fucking cool!!!
---
I'd argue they massively increased the quality. But decreased the FEEL
---
That being said, new druid animations are legit
---
I never heard of WoW ever having combat music, is there a video that depicts what you're talking about id be very curious on how it sounded like.
---
Bonus points if it's a warrior

At 60. At 40 it was free.
---
Use this  [https://classicdb.ch/?npc=6491](https://classicdb.ch/?npc=6491)   And you generally get sent to the one that is closest to where you died at, but its not always the case as some Spirit Healers are Alliance only and some are Horde only.
---
Well that is completely wrong info right there. You don't need to have that many pummelers at all. They already out-threat any warrior that has a shield on by default (if geared similarly). Pummelers are good for initial threat on DPS bosses and the like.
---
Usually they are popped at the start of *some* bosses and then they switch to a mitigation weapon. After popping 1 charge you are already super ahead.
---
Also farming pummelers is not that big of a deal. It is reasably fast. Just another consumable on your list that you can use occasionally.

Play a dwarf hunter, so when you go back and watch the cinematic trailer in another 10 years you can say to yourself, hey thats me when the dwarf first appears.
---
I don’t understand why you’d need to actually spec into holy disc while leveling. The imp wand —&gt; shadow spec lets you have the most sustain while leveling and you can just hop out of shadow form to heal for dungeons, etc. From what I’ve read, nothing pre-60 requires you to go holy to heal.
---
I propose an open battle on Reddit.
---
#NoChanges *beats drums of war*
---
Is nobody gonna mention how the belf said "How's Come?" 
---
Personally, I think it's great ;)
---
Without gear progression there really isn't an endgame. If anyone could do anything, then pre-raid BIS would be all you would need to clear all of the content. Or if you did some how have progression then fresh 60s would be nothing compared to say WotLK 60s. The way they "should" have added content is add to kalimdor and EK so that they didn't turn them into empty ghost towns. ie hyjal, twilight highlands.
---
Who the hell is Harlan?
---
Female gnome warrior gotta be the least.
---
something i highly suggest doing (at least for dungeons) is to have a button that rotates through your party members automatically! healing is super fun :)
---
Actually it did for a while, now they require a custom launcher
---
What's most desired is what they don't have. If you want to get a slot in a raid, Druids are a good bet as they have a small population. You can also be the healer or tank for your leveling, though you'll be expected to heal in raids. Some guilds will have a 3 or 4th tank Feral druid who tanks some bosses and heals most others.
---
Priests are also very desirable as healers, shadow you may see one in a raid, but no more.
---
&gt; though they do get Circle of Healing in BC
---
CoH was not a smart heal in TBC. it just healed the group of whoever you healed, like PoH.
---
I can't remember most of the chain, but I remember that dude being a real workout. We had people in T2 with us and we still wiped a few times.
---

PVP Events unique to each landmass like the Gurbashi arena and what’s found in each of the TBC zones.
---
&gt;spins like a dreidel
---
oy veyyyy
---
Would you incentivize attacking capital cities in any way?
---
But isn’t BiS subjective depending on what content you choose to do? Also just because you have the gear to do a raid doesn’t mean you can do it automatically. Plus it takes so many raid clears to gear just a couple players it would make everyone’s interests lie in different content so they could get that one trinket they wanted, or tier piece they needed. I think that giving players the freedom to choose what content they want to tackle adds a lot more progression than gating content and making old gear from past expansions less usable imo.
---
Why do you have heirlooms then lol
---
Loot trading and heirlooms didnt exist 15 years ago. Though that helmet being ilvl 25 shows it was obtained before 7.3.5 I dont see what's special or classic about this?
---
How will the new graphics affect mining and herbalism nodes? Is it going to be harder seeing herbs in denser foliage? I guess probably not since retail likely doesn't have an issue.
---
Either are good. Warriors spend a lot of time eating and mages spend a lot of time drinking so your down-time is coordinated. Druids are great leveling partners overall because of their versatility.
---
Oh you’ll leave me with that?
---
Thank you boss. I acquiesce to your authority.  /s
---
Fuck, you are a dull, pseudo intellectual and I can almost guarantee you’ve never seen the inside of Naxx. 
---
I’ll leave this conversation too, we’ll never see eye to eye.
---
! RemindMe 60 days
---
Every class is viable in one or more aspects of the game, but the roles that each class can perform in are limited when it comes to raiding. Hunters, for example, farm well, are easy to get good scores in pvp, but usually are minimized in raids due to their low DPS. The spec really isn't the factor here - even with the best spec they still don't bring the same power as other ranged DPS.
---
Either Greenfuzz on a gnome Rogue or Ramone on a human Mage for me.
---
Horde Feral tanks are still doing more TPS than horde Warriors except the Warrior is dual wielding.
---
Don't die in dun morogh near the southwest unless you want to run back from coldridge valley...
---
GW2 had these events that could spawn in a zone like say a caravan going between two locations. You could add stuff like that with opposing objectives for each faction with a reward for the winner.
---
Not possible.
---
The only repeatable quests which will enable you to gain rep past ~50-60% revered are gated at level 50+.
---
This is true for any cross faction rep.
---
I chuckled and upvoted, but I'm still going to play a balance druid come Classic.

This sub is a weird experience for me because I played a ton in vanilla, and haven't followed WoW since then. So all of these posts are like, "Oh, it looks like Blizzard killed their Guild Relations Program. TIL."
---
Trolls are bis for pve for most classes though because of beserking, and they're arguably the best tanks due to the increased threat generation

All his glory sorta undone by the fact that you took a horrible quality cell phone pic of your monitor.

Couldn’t loot trade until WotLK which certainly wasn’t 15 years ago.  Heirlooms also didn’t exist until WotLK.  
---
If you started playing during WotLK, why lie about it?
---
Wouldn't really have to expand it, if Battlegrounds did not exist people would just be pvping out in the world even more.
---
I like how random people are coming in and seeing how bad this guy looks and he has no fucking idea lmao. This is one of the biggest r/iamverysmart's I've ever seen
---
As a human it will be a lot easier just pay attention to class quests, I don’t recall the early warrior class quests. A night elf will have a much tougher time getting through the wetlands. Can be done but expect a fair share of corpse running.
---
Fake news
---
You dont need to gear for defense as a warrior. The mobs dont hit hard enough to one or two shot you (obvious insta-gib mechanics excepted). Just keep shield block up on cooldown and you'll be fine. Hell, I mained a warrior from release to cata and no one ever asked me what my defense was until i hit level 70.
---
For MC, just make sure you got 5k hp and 7k armor and you'll do fine.
---
You might be getting downvoted friend but know that I appreciated the joke.
---
Actually I did not. Morrowgraine is the ungoro soil quest I referenced.
---
You are correct in that I did not include the Tauren counterpart.
---
Regardless, the quest itself is level gated which means it cannoy be used pre 40's
---
It also rewarded an extremel low portion of rep during Vanilla 5 - 10 per turn in iirc.
---
That's a LOT of turn ins for exalted.
---
[here](http://web.archive.org/web/20050815004726/http://www.warcraftrealms.com/census.php)'s some census data from vanilla.
---
you can easily see that trolls were the least played. though that doesn't prove that trolls had the least common race/class combo, it does make it slightly more likely. too bad blizz doesn't include M/F data in /who queries, or we might actually have the answer to this question.
---
naively, i would guess female troll shaman or female orc shaman would be the least played.
---
This is why I will make it my mission to roll a class that specifically is anti-Rogue. 
---
I've mainly played Shaman and Priest so playing against melee in general has sucked, and casters have never been an issue, but this time around I'll probably be making a Druid, Hunter, or Mage.
---
BiS is subjective to a certain extent but as far as raiding and high PvP go there will always be a meta. Some builds and gear are just going to be better. If everything was level 60 you'd only have to aquire one set of raid gear ever. What's the point of having all those raids if you only need 16-18 pieces of gear ever. The gear grind is MMOs, can't have one without the other. And not sure what else you need to raid other than gear, other people I guess, but that's a given.
---
Which means... They found a way around it! :V Modding prevails!
---
Less time getting ganked is balanced by not having a feeling of immersion, fun and danger. I think the answer is clear. Do you want your precious time spent to have substance? Or do you want to be safe no matter where you go, and only fight againt the computer controlled monsters.
---
 I feel like this sub is more nostalgia heads than classic wow heads. I guess that’s why the prevailing point of view is that leveling a ret pally and spending 10 days played in scarlet monastery is the best way to play.
---
This is why I roll PvE.  Can’t handle being ganked and I don’t like ganking.  Simple solution.
---
Now if Blizzard didn’t have PvE, I’d be screwed.
---
What's your account looking like stat wise? If they're low the content can be monotonous
---
NEETS and autistic meter watchers don’t like me? Uh oh.
---
I don’t even play a cat Druid. I main a Resto Shaman/hunter and raid high end. I’m very much down to earth. I know what’s viable and I know what’s actually optimal. 
---
This game is fifteen years old. Live a little.
---
Thanks for the insight. I played Shaman/Priest before so near got into the tank/melee DPS side of things. I assume you still got the +10 defensive skill (Anticipation) from the Warrior tree during your time in raids? Even though you said it wasn't a big concern.
---
Dwarf/troll rogues, tauren hunters.
---
You don’t need anything else you I just mean  it’s a challenge to beat the content, you have to know how to play. Not all of raiding is just a gear check. I see your point though but wouldn’t the meta open up if all gear was the scaled the same? Like when thunderfury was only good through vanilla and at the beginning of BC and then it got outscaled. If everything was always scaled then what if thunderfury could’ve seen use in say WotLk or late BC for example? Just an example but maybe you get my point.
---
Relax NEET. Just because you don’t agree with my proposition, doesn’t let you reeeeeeee me all the way to the dog house.
---
The unique war mount and title was enough incentive back in the day for people to organize and join city raid groups. Killing unsuspecting horde noobs was a plus. :)
---
80-85 combat and 80 ish slayer. Best gear I can wear till god armour and weapons. I just get bored and take breaks.

Classic db, the patch will be 1.12 so item stats wont change, just see what is available in the phase and that's what is available
---
Mages destroy hunters as gear scales.
---
Post BWL a deep frost mage can’t lose 1v1 to a hunter.
---
Shamans are a mix, imo CS is huge.
---
Warlocks are hard.
---
If thunderfury could keep up in the meta it would incentivize people to go back and have a reason to grind some Molten Core. Plus that means more content each week something new, or mostly just different each week to freshen things up.
---
Starcraft shits on 40k
---
Bury me with downvotes
---
Disgusting.

I play Priest as my main because they have a lot of spell utility that can be used in a lot of different ways. For instance in BGs you can Mind Control people off cliffs in to their deaths or you can Mind Control a monster in a dungeon and let the adds kill it so you have 1 less to deal with next pull. There is so much you can do as a Priest but you have to think fast and know what your spells are capable of.
---
Only that you don't need to farm gnomer 24/7 at all.
---
I don’t kill greys, greens yellows reds all fair but I find anyone who ganks greys without good reason such as farming your farm spot is lame as fuck for doing so.
---
Yeah, I mainly picked it for the extra avoidance instead of the crit reduction. More dodges and parries = good.
---
I had no idea. Also I couldn't see the nameplate from my phone. Whoops!
---
Yup makes sense. Don't think you'll have any troubles.
---
Like.A.BeyBlade.
---
I will add them to my imaginary upvotes ;)
---
Maybe more common with Joana being more known
---
Different weapons are better in different situations
---
Well it's kind of important as they are less than a budget rogue without those things.
---
Blizzard really didn't think WOW was going to be as successful as it was and was worried it wouldn't make its money back.
---
Activision is just running off the fumes of 2004. It's not Blizzard anymore.
---
Had a friend express similar sentiments. I blame exposure bias typically. To each their own; but Starcraft is much less interesting to me. I love the Tolkein model of fantasy archtypes. 40k takes that, puts it in space and gives them chainsaw swords.
---
I have played paladin duo with warlock and hunter. The amount of controll you bring with a paladin makes you the perfect fit for duoing with anyone ;) Paladin + Anything works awesome! The thing I found was that gankers always go for the easiest target. I found myself healing my friend (Especially the Warlock) vs. Gankers. We ofc took them by storm when we retaliated. When playing with a hunter its the same. With a rogue you can give him blessing of freedom and keep him up while recking whoever thought to gank you. Be prepared to be the target your self since your friend is invis most of the time :)
---
Not sure I never played hunter
---
Gravestone Scepter is available at level 18 to both factions actually
---
I played a rogue and warrior tank for most of my WoW days but played a mage in vanilla.
---
I'm gonna go rogue. Never played it in vanilla and, aside from prot warrior, it's the class I'm most familiar with.

I was a Shaman before, but I plan to roll a Warlock come Classic.  I have a Warlock a test run on a Vanilla server and it’s the easiest leveling experience I’ve ever had. Like “woops I pulled 5 mobs let me press two more buttons than normal” easy. 
---
Im lazy, so that’s right up my alley.
---
Warsong Gulch would be how you got from Ashenvale to The Barrens.  You would have to get through a portal where the flag is in the flag room to get into the other zone.  You would come out/go in to the respective portals in Ashenvale and The Barrens, where you would originally go to queue for the BG.
---
Booty hunting.
---
People buy a map for that days treasure chest, it has a 5 min respawn rate.
---
I'm doing basically this. Only requirements to raid will be show up and be 60(58? Who cares lol) I plan to be shit face drunk every raid who cares what you actually complete in Vanilla done it 100 times before personally.. Probably have to pug lots of people every raid but whatever it'll be fun herding cats lol
---
Exactly... so...
---
Well TF isn't the best example because it's an legendary so if it was all 60 you'd expect that to be the best tank weapon. But let's just say for example everything is 60 and the caster neck from KT is BiS for mages and locks just like it was in vanilla. That means that two classes would be competing for that neck and every other caster neck, in every other raid is really just a filler. Can't really have a MMO without the gear grind.
---
people told me improved mana burn is better but honestly I don't know.
---
backpacking off of this post though, why don't people max out improved mind blast?
---
Would it be dumb to take 2 points from improved VE and one point from Meditation to max out improved mind blast?
---
If it's not in your top 3-4 classes you want to play, you'll just log off one day and decide to reroll instead of logging back on them the next.
---
Always kill on sight.
---
Rogue, something different, for a different experience
---
They shit on everyone in TBC in world pvp. I despised druids.
---
manaburn and put the 2 points from improved ve in healing focus.
---
I was an Undead Rogue and a Dwarf Warrior.
---
Planning on going Shaman, since I've mained one since LK, with a Rogue alt
---
You're right this is pretty true. BUt regardless, played a lock on nostalrius with the hopes of getting into mostly pvp, quit half way to 60 because I realised my character fundamentally doesn't work on alliance in pvp.
---
Then they shut down the servers etc etc.
---
I think I'll be rolling an Undead Mage and abusing the fuck out of this stupid stupid racial ability. After all, the only true counter for an ice mage are locks and priests.
---
Ive been playing casual since 2014, not looking for a hardcore guild but something relevant for pvp and raiding.
---
-Australia
---
- Normal, pvp
---
-Horde
---
-Evening into nightime as I'm at uni.
---
-i loved pvp ever since i first played it 5 years ago
---
-i dont have any specific rules
---
-i got discord or phone in aus for contact
---
-looking to play a warrior to tank and pvp, but ive never vanilla tanked only tanked really as a dk leveling through bc. So i guess I'm willing to learn to play defensive.
---
Does that mean I'll have to go out of shadowform a lot to throw heals?
---
I played a female dwarf warrior in vanilla, was the MT for my raiding guild through MC and reached rank 12 in pvp. People couldn't wrap their heads around it back then, they were so rare.
---
Let the grunts deal with the mob, I'll deal with the grunts.
---
Can I switch from combat swords to dagger spec as a human and still be viable in a raid format?
---
Rolled an undead holy priest in vanilla, rolling the same guy this time around. Love healing in MMOs and I always dig the priest class fantasy.
---
I'm changing my alt from a druid to a warlock, though. Just for something different.
---
This pretty much sums up my vanilla experience. 😂
---
Most common: Human male warrior  
---
Least common: Troll female shaman  
---
These are purely guesses btw.
---
No XP Waste!
---
Resplendent Buckler of Shadow Wrath.
---
Think about that for a minute.
---
"I'm rolling pally because I'm gay"
---
I havent fully decided but as with druid heart of the wild spec theres a paladin one i seen thats like 20 holy and rest either ret or prot that can be a generalist build. Everyone talks raiding but i figure ill be doing more messing around farming dungeons than raiding. I remember doing some dungeons with paladin tanks in vanilla. Surely it's not like so bad its not worth it for 5 mans if you cant find a warrior to just paly or druid tank it?
---
Lol, can you elaborate
---
PvE server horde is basically an oxymoron xD
---
Played a Dwarf hunter during Vanilla the first time around, and I will most likely play that again. Mostly because I have always loved hunter and because I want to experience all of the nostalgia from the first time I played Vanilla.
---
Okay we will take these 1 at a time because the flow from comment to comment gets interrupted and it just makes for bad argumentation.
---
**"you gained almost no advantage by standing still anymore, ignoring mages used to punish you."**
---
That was basically true in TBC **when contrasted with** vanilla. Or you can argue that point, so far you haven't
---
**"Ofc you gained an advantage standing still. Spamming frostbolts &gt; spamming Icelance."**
---
This is you trying to be pedantic, every single ranged dps class with a castable spell gained **something** if they could stand still and do an optimal rotation. It was the **change** from a frost mage being able to kill a fully geared warrior with 2 or 3 crits to TBC style hp/mitigations combine with the damage values of the mage spells being rebalanced. They have to nerf the mage damage to account for their water elemental's dps, they had to nerf stationary damage to balance out with their newfound damage while mobile with 3+ ways to freeze and having icelance. What it comes down to is you think I literally believed spamming icelance was higher dps than casting frostbolts, in which case you're wrong. Or you know I was exaggerating a little bit over the crappy new balance and decided to ignore than to win internet points on a technicality.
---
**"That's not just mages though, that's pretty much every single class in  tbc compared to vanilla. And the main reason for that is resilience."**
---
I agree but that isn't **the only** thing that changed. If mages had "frost form" as their last talent, icelance had a cooldown, and all their other spells did 40% more damage it would not have been a problem.
---
**"Ofc a mage using ice Lance is gonna deal more than one ignoring it.  You're making it seem like spamming Icelance would be the preferred  tactic, which it absolutely was not. To act like frostbolts did no  damage is absurd."**
---
I never said frostbolts did no damage, you're strawmanning me. I said many times they basically became part of a rotation of spells rather than being the meat and potatos of your arsenal, and in so lost a ton of their **damage to health pool ratio.**
---
It's pretty obvious to anyone with 2 points of IQ to rub together and who has had sunlight hit them in the last week that I didn't mean every single last word **100% literally, after being sworn in by a judge.** News flash that is completely normal, people use embellishments and hyperbole to accentuate their points. But here is a video from TBC, if the frostbolts in this video do less % of a persons total hp pool than frostbolts did in classic, I am correct and you're proven false.

---
I have a feeling you might be more comfortable in the retail wow forums dude.
---
The Windstone enemies dropped some experimental prefixes that are a lot closer to prefixes we got in TBC. Some sharing the same name but not necessarily the same effect.
---
I always thought people went 3 points into Improved MB, but either way, the reasoning in PvE is for a rotation you can get 2 full MF off in between each MB, but someone with more knowledge could explain better why you wouldn’t get the extra points in PvP.
---
For me it’s “nothing sucks more than heading out into the world looking to level, but every single person you see ganks you.” 
---
I am playing on a pve server because of that.
---
Naw, I hope neither of you play classic.
---
Shadow priest and paladin. Going warrior mage this time.
---
I've done two different full on grinds to 60 (Priest and Druid), well , I say full on grind but I did do a few quests that were just there in my way, but 95% of my leveling was from strictly grinding. Both times I leveled I had more than enough money for mount at 40, and was also able to get epic mount the second I dinged 60.
---
I honestly cannot remember my exact time as I didn't check right as I leveled, but I would assume anywhere from 6-10 days depending so much on your class and how busy the server is.
---
The absolute biggest tip I can tell anyone about grinding is simply to not listen to what other people are telling that the 'best' grind places are, because chances are - they are the best, and the best leads to many other people grinding those monsters as well. I found myself way off the beaten path in Desolace grinding random beasts was was 3-4x better than cats in STV because there wasn't any competition or pvping (If you want the pvp, then absolutely more power to you to fight in STV areas). Consistency of monsters is almost always better than fighting over better monsters to kill. Find an area of beasts and grind until you over level by two levels or it becomes a waste of time with competition or griefing.
---
One of the biggest perks also to grinding a lot is having excess money, so you are able to buy a few upgrades that normally if questing you wouldn't want to spend the money on - this will lead to much faster grinding as well as just enjoyment of upgrades. 
---
Bags, bags, BAGS!! They are SOOO important, you will spend all your money if you have to get the absolute best bags possible, this will save you so much time and in turn make you level and make much more money. I'd say try to nab 12 slot bags even if they are overpriced as quick as you can and then save to get full 16 slot bags (You will more than likely find a few of these on the way up, my Druid actually self found a full set of 16 slot bags while leveling).
---
I know I'm all over the board ranting on the subject, it was just such a different and enjoyable experience for me grinding instead of questing to 60 that is it absolutely my plan come classic launch. I am no way an expert on it but that is my experience with it.
---
Speaking of darker, I kinda wish they kept the original concept for Duskwood in. You’d be essentially blind while not holding a torch. It would make the zone feel a lot more spooky
---
Isn’t BiS subjective to what spec you play? Also won’t the “BiS” change and evolve the more different combinations people try? I don’t think the gear grind would ever end. People would always be chasing something else to use in PvP or to improve their clear time or ability to clear each raid. I see what you are saying though and I could see the goal being muddied, like people feeling like what’s the point.  Idk I just I see what you are saying but I don’t necessarily think that having one BiS is a problem? That’s how it is regardless of scaling or not. There is filler gear rn but that’s not a problem? Filler gear just creates player diversity to me. Also resistance gear opens a whole new element that can cause people to try to find the best mix of dps/survivability. All the gear grind does is add an artificial barrier to content that could instead be unlocked a different way. What if maybe you had to complete one raid to unlock the next like in a sequence? Wouldn’t having every raid always be a challenge and make you have to try be better than killing the sandbox?
---
I can't thank you enough for this.
---
Effort put-in versus reward output. You spend all day grinding, eating in between kills and all you get to show for your efforts is a massive repair bill and easily the slowest leveling of all classes. If you can stick it out, PVP is insanely fun when you're geared though.
---
Just buy Blizzbucks for $7.99 to reset your raid lockout. No need to grind at all.
---
/s
---
I never understood this because trolls have that 10+ to bows. And I’m pretty sure in some stupid way skills make it easier to hit stuff (maybe improving hit in a subconscious type of way?) I’m maybe I’m just high on these wisdom tooth meds
---
I played NE and undead rogue in classic on two separate servers, got them both to the rank where you get the pvp mounts. Had an orc shaman alt and a human paladin. I was a teenager back in vanilla though. 
---
This time around I am sticking with horde. Probably going to roll orc hunter and / or orc rogue. Leaning more towards hunter just for the ease of leveling. I am old now and have a wife, job, and kid on the way, so way less time to play. I figure since hunters are such good / fast levelers I might actually get to end game even my limited play time.
---
Yup done that before. I've also just opened on them with Cheap Shot (stun) and then left them without actually damaging them if they were much lower level or something. Just to scare them a little.
---
Honestly though it never hurts  to ask.
---
Double mage is a super powerful leveling duo too, but you compete for the same gear which is a big downside.
---
Cat durid are for BENCH
---
I believe it’s +5
---
I am low key sad about Alterac Valley not being around right at the beginning. I loved that BG when I was younger.
---
But no BGs will keep world PvP going for a good while.
---
Always felts like with the excess space in contested zones, there would be little towns that would flip like Halaa from BC. Added flight paths and maybe recipes for victors?
---
That's a great answer. I'm old too. Efficiency is kinda important.
---
Why thank you, are you leaning towards anything in particular or completely up in the air?
---
I resent that!
---
Mained undead rogue since Vanilla, and I have never had an interest in PvP. I'll even help the opposing faction with mobs/quests if given the chance.
---
Looking for AU/NZ guild for PVE and PVP.
---
well too bad!
---
The name of the class makes it sound far more soft than it really is. It's more of a Battlecleric, with a magical basis for armor in Inner Fire, Power Word Fortitude for a larger health pool, Renew to passively heal damage taken at a very decent rate, and an anti-spell interruption in Power Word Shield to enable a major self-heal or offensive spell. 
---
With all these tools, the "Battlecleric" can hold their own in non-dungeon face-to-face melee fights. Intersperse wand shots with big staff melee attacks, while Holy Fire's DoT and Shadow Word Pain is compounding more damage, and at the end wait for Spirit Tap to help regenerate that mana for the next fight.
---
Fuck this hurt. I was a hunter and I couldn’t wait to be able to wear mail so I could wear my herod’s shoulders and helm. And axe of course.
---
There was an addon in vanilla but I can't remember what it was called. Basically both the players and the paladin would download it, and players would then automatically whisper the paladin which buff they needed, and the addon would record it, and automatically give out the buff with a simple click. It saved a lot of time.
---
Yes, 100%
---
I'm pretty sure you have to be at least lvl 5 to acquire enchanting. At which you can then DE everything in Classic.
---
I would also like to know! I was 8 when I played so I don’t remember much lmao
---
:3
---
I would have moved its release to line up in phase 4 with ZG in Classic. It basically fills in the same purpose as ZG as a catch up mechanic and an alternate gearing mechanism while not invalidating BWL gear.
---
I'll probably collect certain pieces for off-sets.
---
I played Shaman. I still play him today in BFA, or did, anyway. Don't play retail at all now. But I'm going priest in classic. I want to do almost exclusively healing in PvP, and if I want to PvP competitively in ranking groups, that means either priest or paladin. Shamans in the vanilla meta nowadays are pushed in to elemental/resto spec. It's just not more me. I wanna save lives
---
I healed with a holy paladin from vanilla through BC.
---
Then Tanked with a Druid through wrath and cataclysm. 
---
I've never mained a DPS in the 6 years that I played wow.
---
I'll be rolling mage come classic.
---
Time for me to be a bit less stressed out in raids.
---
Probs correct. I’ve been playing tbc servers so it’s probably altered
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28uB4ym6TCM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28uB4ym6TCM)
---
I went to school with him! His nickname was Toaster lol
---
Hi, /u/SadCaterpillar
---
Mage last time. Can't recommend it enough.
---
Priest this time. Wanna try a different role. Maybe see if I like it being on the bottom.
---
That dude was so good at playing a warrior, he got hired by Blizzard afterwards. There are a few items in the game named after him. I'd say he's a bit more than just semi famous.
---
Buffbot yes. 
---
Tank 5 mans yes
---
Tank raids efficiently in raids? No.
---
They have No taunt so No, you Can not tank raid dungeon sure
---
yes, base mana, which is like a fifth of your actual mana pool. its costly, but a shadowpriest that never heals, is just like a ret/enh/feral that never heals, a dumbass.
---
&gt; Will I still be able to tank efficiency as a Paladin
---
Depends, tank raids or dungeons?
---
&gt;  or am I just a buffbot and cooldown whore in raids?
---
Paladins are actually really efficient ST healers.
---
Is hunter viable in classic, and how much if so? I love playing archers in mmos but never did in wow.
---
Cat form, and cheetah are from the trainers which you can easily get to w/ port to moonglade spell and hearth back, or visit the top of the mage district in stormwind.
---
Mutated sealion quest is from Darn or Moonglade at 16, but thats the only 'real' reason to go back.
---
different class of abilities, really. as a shaman you should consider totem management a part of your 'rotation'. they are a play style thing. paladin buffs are prepull annoyance.
---
As a die hard warrior fan...I’ve considered playing druid just to gank people as a moon powered chicken man!
---
True but he’s got a good point since energy is specific to rogues. Literally every other class has mana except warrior (which is already represented in the meme)
---
But shit I’m not on reddit trying to meta-analyze memeology. I’m just chuckling and moving on
---
For shaman go resto/elemental until you are done pvp ranking and then go enhance from there.
---
the hunter spec removed scatter for wyvern, and wyvern can't be used in combat, it also dots the target so it can mess up your traps. For hunter pvp it seems like trueshot + survival is the most common, probably an all around build that doesn't sacrifice much 1v1. For duels and 1v1's I have a feeling 21 beast 21 marks for pet stun on top of scatter is probably more powerful.
---
I was a druid but felt like I was always sub par compared to pure classes. The expansions changed that dynamic but I wanted to try a more dominant pure dps, like Mage or Hunter. Just unsure of how it'll change my experience because I really enjoyed doing things solo and druid was great for that.
---
I played on a PvP server as a human rogue at release, and got to about level 49ish by the time the honor system was patched in. But the BGs weren't in the game yet, so the only way to get honor was world PvP.
---
After 2 weeks of not being able to get to 50 because every questing zone was full of marauding level 60s tearing my butthole apart like the nerds from gastown in Mad Max, I just stopped playing WoW. I came back in a few months and rolled a Troll Warrior on a PvE server and never looked back.
---
Why do you recommend mage?
---
World boss fights would be about who gets to the boss fight over major brawls.
---
Kill x are actually worse to do in a group as you gain less xp than you should for finishing the quest since a lot of the xp comes from the fact that you're grinding mobs, 1/2 to 3/4 of the xp value of doing a particular quest can actually come from the kill portion of doing it, and that gets slashed badly for every person you're grouped with. Duos are especially bad as you don't even get a group bonus for that. 3-5 gives you a small amount of bonus xp per kill but it's trivial compared to full amount you should be getting.
---
But you're only getting a fraction of that xp amount.
---
non-shared drop quests are more group friendly, since you have to kill extra enemies till everyone is ready so the xp from kills is about what it should be.
---
This can actually cost you A LOT of xp in the long run vs soloing for non-group quests (except non-shared drops).
---
As in like 9 levels worth over the course of 1-60 if you grouped the whole way. (it also wastes rest xp if you have any, since you could've gotten even more).
---
It's generally best to save grouping for group quests if you want to be really efficient or only group up for quests where you'll be killing a bunch of extra enemies anyway).
---
Of course. +5 with swords does help out a bit but I feel like people just exaggerate the importance of it, making it sound like you'll do 50% less damage and people will kick you out of the raids and dungeons. You'll be fine.
---
WoW WAS a casual game in 2004.
---
WoW IS a casual game in 2019.
---
WoW Classic, will also be a casual game.
---
People will be leveling professions while they level or after. It will take weeks to months, but when it starts there will be a ton of demand. Vendor some of it if you need, but you can always vendor that stuff later at the same price. Also, most classes, even healer benefit from first aid, and it really is super easy to level while you grind.
---
Was a rogue gonna stay a rouge. Gotta stay true to what made you love the game
---
Used to get kicked from LFG groups all the time for trying to guide people through this cesspool. So glad they changed it.
---
and warlock is mushroom lol
---
Wotlk
---
Go gnomish, craft all the things oy gnomish engineers can, relearn engineering for goblin
---
Awesome!
---
That's not even the biggest problem and it's a really big problem.
---
Not only is it viable, but it is also necessary. MC/BWL/AQ40/Naxx all have bosses which enrage and only hunters can dispel those effects. There are other things they bring to the table such as kiting and using frost trap to slow adds. Usually raid will have between 1 and 4 hunters.
---
Every class is viable, don't worry.
---
I was hoping to tank in raids. I used to MT as a Warrior but figured there's enough fights a Paladin should be able to offtank.
---
I didn't start until BC, where Druid was my first character. Which I loved but one thing that never stopped bothering me was never getting to see my gear or slap things with my weapons.  
---
On the flip side, the only classes that truly give things a proper with their weapons in vanilla are Warriors and Rogues (please, Paladins...just stand down). I'm not interested in Rogue and everyone and their BFF Jill are gonna be Warriors, so I dunno. Maybe I'll just shock everyone and go Warlock
---
Priest. He can give you a shield to while aoe pulling and has a little bit of aoe if needed moreover rez and healer for dungeon.
---
Played fury warrior till 60. After I switched protection. Will do the same but will make an alt lock or mage for farming.
---
Some smart urban planning. Making ally and horde hubs closer together in contested zones at max level, more gys in those areas, pretty much anything to ensure that all endgame content will at least bring you in proximity of the other faction and it will happen naturally. I really hate the BFA method of just getting a weekly quest to kill x alliance in a certain zone. Feels lazy
---
&gt; I was hoping to tank in raids.

But, in all seriousness, check [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdNFdBB3GfA) on paladin tanking and it's issues.
---
This video was made with data from a private server, not with reference from Vanilla.
---
This will not be possible to acheive in Classic WoW.
---
It will not be possible to gain cross faction exalted pre 50 in classic.
---
Rolled human rog as my first ever character, deleted after a few levels and mained a male NE hunter for the rest of vanilla.... saw some TBC raids with that toon, decided to roll rogue again because arena and haven't looked back since.
---
Will be rolling rog for classic as it's easily the most comfortable class for me, I'm looking forward to vanish-immune the most, not so excited for poison charges.
---
Cappable areas/keeps and relics that give faction wide bonuses for holding. I think Outland had something like that? I didn't PvP in BC.  
---
I did PvP in WotLK and absolutely loved Wintergrasp. Not quite "world PvP" but I thing large dedicated PvP regions generally work better than world PvP.
---
Any duo works fine for leveling. I’ve done this duo before and it works good. Having the heals alone makes everything so much faster.
---
Going to level as a ret paladin then switch to holy for raiding. Can't wait!!
---
If WotF determines which faction you play you got problems. Undead aren’t gonna faceroll locks cuz of it.
---
I played a Shadow Priest. This time around I think I am going either Smite Priest, Spell Power Paladin or Spell Power Enhance Sham. 
---
I can’t decide which yet. But I like doing weird builds that turn heads now a days. Ive played everything else.
---
&gt;https://classicdb.ch/?item=7001
---
It actually is not a prequest, just extra xp. I remember doing it on Nost where I could obtain that quest without doing the prequest. Oh well, we will see in a couple months :p
---
Loved that post. One of the main reasons I’m playing Druid. Still have my doubts about 29/11/11 balance in PVP (while using my entire kit), but I’ll try and make it work!
---
&gt; Is that a cash grab?
---
Yes, but so are all products.
---
&gt;  A product designed primarily or solely with the intent of generating profits.
---
If you're worried about levelling I would play a warlock
---
Hunter, shaman and Druid.
---
Druids and hunters suck in vanilla (well, low raid utility) so I’m either going Shaman or priest. 
---
I like healing
---
Check out this [gear list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wGBasFY8fFGpBtiD1TAUBB99wxboCSVh5MW_6b_z0oU/pubhtml#)
---
You can see how the PvP gear ranks with other choices. They're definitely great but there are other viable options.
---
In Vanilla, the felhunter hadn't been nerfed into the ground yet. It could remove magic debuffs from friendly targets and magic buffs from enemy targets. It had spell lock for stopping casts. It had paranoia for helping your team spot rogues. It had tainted blood to make it slightly tankier when an angry rogue went to kill it.
---
It was the gold standard of PvP pets. Way better than an iffy CC that shares DR with fear anyway.
---
Eventually a lot of the raids will have pug groups going. I joined late vanilla and plugged MC and a few others some times before joining a steady raid guild. Can't necessary expect to make great strides that way, but it'd work around your schedule easy.

That’s *Ser* toaster to you
---
I think you'll have an uphill battle in 5 mans as well. Tanks that quickly run oom, have no ranged pull, no taunt, and poor itemisation make everything more work.
---
&gt; Are you really losing a huge aspect of the game on a pve server?
---
Yes
---
Yeah, I think that’ll be my choice if it looks like I won’t have a ton of time to play when classic comes out. It’s kind of up in the air right now depending on when classic comes out and what my life will be like at that point
---
Dear future raiders,

I can only speak for myself. Playing on a PvE servers feels like missing half the experience.
---
Female Troll rogue.
---
I dont think anything beats it.
---
Scarlet thots drop the tabard.
---
i want to play balance druid but heard its not that good unless they balance it no pun intended xd
---
Are you picking priest over pally purely based on being horde?
---
Played Warlock from Vanilla until Legion when I quit.  
---
My favourite non-warlock spec is enhance shaman but its too weak in vanilla and I want to roll Alliance again so thinking of trying something completely new.  
---
So for classic my plan is to roll a prot/fury warrior and then do either mage or warlock alt.  
---
I also thought about Paladin as a healer, but they are so boring to level I just don't think I can do it during vanilla.
---
It's not specific to rogues though. Druids have it as well. 
---
Your argument would make sense if rogues were released first and druids were added later. But both were there when the game launched.
---
Shadow resist. Unkillable
---
Everything but Mechstriders (Dwarf/Gnome only).
---
Tauren can only ride kodos and dire wolves.
---
Dropped mounts can be used by anyone.
---
Undead priest is pretty insane with that one wand someone mentioned before. Druids are great because they can't die if stacked stam so you can have fun being the flag carrier every game.   
---
If you want a really busted twink go for a 29 hunter twink. Get the stv gun from the quest line and shred people with it.
---
Sorry I should have expanded on that a little more lol. I like being a versatile healer and paladins are purely defensive healers in premades and priests are much more offensive with dispel, mind control etc.
---
There's definitely an argument for some people being employed, aside from that I guess they did it on a voluntary basis. One thing I've noticed from discords recently is that some attitudes are definitely "us vs them" when it comes to the private server 'elite' and retail players. It's totally hypothetical, drawn out and boring.
---
I've always considered the optional flagging on PvE servers to lead to more unfair/unbalanced PvP, where someone basically gets the element of surprise or at the very least, the first hit.
---
Maybe it's because I've only played on PvP servers (and so I consider it just a way of life), but I don't remember ganking being THAT bad where I was scared to go ANYWHERE in the world. Sure, sometimes a 60 or group of them would feel like they want to control Marshal's Refuge and make leveling hell for people in Ungoro or something, and you get frustrated about it, but after 15 minutes you're in Feralas doing something else.
---
The whole "who PvP flags first" thing is a foreign concep to me. I feel like I would start out an auto-flagger, and eventually stop flagging myself after being screwed over by one too many Pyroblasts, Soul Fires, and Aimed Shots to the face that I didn't have to take.
---
I played a Hunter for most of Vanilla and a Druid for most of TBC. I'm planning on playing Shaman and Warlock for Classic.
---
I played Warlock before and actually even made a PvP video with it that was reasonably popular until Youtube removed it for all the copyrighted songs. Warlock's playstyle is really fun and in Vanilla, a demonology warlock is so tanky and has so much utility that you can 1v2 and leave the fight with full health. If a warlock has 5k health, you actually need to fight through 3 times that to kill a lock. They're absurd.
---
Tbh the pvp zones with rewards for the faction who won was a good effort. Can’t remember what they called it but it started in wotlk. They ruined it with horrible vehicle controls of course, but an open world siege type objective with an actual worthwhile reward for players was a really good idea, it actually got players out there and in the world. sort of like an open world AV
---
I’d just do something like that, reward players with some sort of content, but have a way to make sure it’s not easily dominated by one side, for instance having some sort of built in handicap for the faction who won the last battle.
---
A pvp version of the AQ war effort would also be really cool and promote a lot of pvp, having objectives you can’t complete through BGs of course, with rewards once its completed
---
Warrior and warrior.
---
kBOOOOOOOOShshshsSH
---
What the hell is a dreidel?
---
Weapon skill for ranged isn't at all as good as for melee. For both, it grants 0.04% chance to hit and to crit, but to melee it also reduces the damage reduction of glancing blows, which ranged doesn't have
---
Neither reward was in vanilla. I'm pretty sure the only titles in vanilla were PvP ranks (Scarab Lord was based on what you did in Vanilla, but I think the title wasn't created until later - TBC was when titles opened up like Hand of A'dal, Champion of the Naaru).
---
Staves, for me. I think I got it up to about 150 as a mage, having never done any melee damage in real combat ever.
---
can't fucking wait
---
Oh Jesus Christ
---
I’m trying to pick between the two actually.  I like the priest play style in general.  I like how they are more offensive and their healing output is insane.  Obviously paladins have bubble and can avoid cc etc a bit better.  But I guess that’s the trade off
---
Weekly gold quests that send players to the same locations. Fights will naturally erupt STV style with so many players competing for the same things.
---
Bows also don’t get disarmed in classic (which is bullshit imo) so maybe it’s a way of balancing?
---
Rewards-wise: probably have to replace some of the BG rewards for the PvPers. But vanilla did sort of drive you to raid in order to stay competitive in PvP (gear-wise) anyway.
---
Also I've read that pserver attempts to modify the honor system to encourage world PvP led to people just camping flight paths all day (so that they get fresh new bodies and avoid the honor penalty for repeatedly killing the same player which was a big killer for your natural open-world PvP)
---
No fun allowed because everyone should be equal Blizzard.
---
Getting killed is the least of a lowbies concern.   Phase 1 will have no dk's.   Goodluck finding a quest giver after the first few weeks.
---
I notice your shaman flair and as someone who is planning to roll shaman I'm curious about hearing more, if that's what you were referring to
---
That is a really awesome concept, but needs more work. Would probably be heavily horde-favored because naturally more traffic to and from The Barrens. And do you think we would still need level brackets? I would love a concept like that in many places around the world, maybe not as the only way to get in and out of an area, but have that be the shortcut, and another longer path around that requires much more walking.
---
This could definitely be recreated with a great server community.
---
I feel gimped going back to priest after healing on a paladin tbh. But I just love looking at a dwarf priest with benediction
---
M’Lord
---
Just download a copy of the WC 3 manual. It covers pretty much every factions history in as much detail as actually matters prior to the onset of the 3rd War.
---
Much like in WC3 the old gods are a bit of a keep it secret/keep it safe thing that we only see hints of during Frozen Throne, and even during Vanilla, exactly what the Sithilid were was a bit of a mystery. Most of which wasn't revealed until the AQ patch added a bunch of lore quests about it when the NE's finally broke their silence about what was going on.
---
True. You can make more money selling leather to  vendors than putting mats on the AH
---
I played a Tauren Druid to about level 30, but I was 13 years old and had no clue wtf I was doing. 
---
I thinking I’m going to reroll the same class and see if I can’t make something of myself this time.
---
rogues and mages also
---
Ha really?  Man ok.  I’m really rolling for the heals so I think maybe paladin is for me.  I mean I’d like to maybe go shadow here and there but that’s not my priority.
---
I mean its not ideal but most group need a tank and people will get desperate enough (easier if you know the group of people). I suppose if you have engineering you can range pull. 
---
Itemization got destroyed when they changed tier 1 from a tanking set to a healing set.
---
You're never going to convince Blizzard that less loot leads to a more rewarding experience. I don't know who designs their loot and reward systems these days but they should be moved over to the D3 team instead.
---
Rogues were the bane of my existence in Vanilla. I think I'll roll one for classic.
---
I'd say, getting ganked will be the least if a lowbies concern.
---
In phase one, after about two weeks, I wouldn't be surprised if all quest givers are hunted down and killed, at least major lowbie quest hubs.  I mean there are no dk's.   It's the only reason I want to lvl quick.
---
I was a rogue that never hit 60 (protip dont roll a class based on gear... bloodfang is amazing but god damn i sucked as a rogue.) then a hunter in vanilla. Loved it, but only being able to dps as a class that immediately falls off the dps meters as phases roll out was tough pill to swallow. This time around I'm going to be either druid or paladin. Very different raiding experience and I'll be hybrid so maybe when the game feels stagnant I'll try a different role. If you're considering hunter they're lovely if you dont need to flex on dps meters to feel good about yourself. Really fun class and it's really really really easy. The difference in a good hunter and an average or subpar hunter is noticeable so while easy it does give you something to actually make effort for.
---
I meant the physical plane/planet from whence the orcs are native when I said Draenor, sorry if that's not the correct term/labeling. Most of my lore knowledge is from WC2, before they shit their pants and retconned everything.
---
Not sure what you mean with sure buddy, disbelief?
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/s6sxQT2](https://imgur.com/a/s6sxQT2)
---
First character I leveled to 60 was mage, second character I leveled to 60 (and later to 70, 80, 85, 90) was Druid (balance at first, then later feral and finally settled on resto). I’m going priest this time because I discovered too late that I really enjoy healing.
---
well yeah obviously haha.  Glacial stone is slow and has a high top-end and I don't remember many people knowing about it so I thought I'd contribute to the discussion.
---
A Warrior tank. Finding a tank is the biggest hurdle in PvE content.
---
Amen!
---
Played a NE rogue in Vanilla, mained a human warrior from BC to Cataclysm when I quit. Now I'm consindering another warrior but something in the back of my head tells me that will be a sub-par idea now that I'm not in school anymore and can only afford to log in irregularely. So... I'm realistically leaning towards better self-sustaining classes like a druid or a warlock. Certainly not a hunter though, hated these when I still played a rogue, couldn't do that to myself.
---
Same, I LOVED the idea as a mage as a kid. Levelled one to 60 and it felt completely meh. Rolled a Druid and suddenly I was in heaven.
---
Except for rogues. It's fun sitting at 80% health after they used the usual stun+gank combo. Also way too many rogues activate that dodge skill if you hit them enough. Ah, Overpower you good friend.
---
Yes. Stay out of group and have the person who wants to be power leveled tag every mob in site, then have your 60 AoE everything down.
---
I had a level 19 human priest twink (arena trinket and all) and the wand is available to horde and alliance.
---
But he is correct, that wand with 25% wand dmg talent can make you scrary af.
---
I would sometimes spec into it, but it just doesn't make that much impact. (was pvp shadow throughout classic)
---
Is this perhaps the coastline between Dun Morogh and Wetlands? Nice pic bro
---
to be fair most cloth stuff just adds more mp5 than usual holy gear. Even in progress raids I refused to wear anything but plate. I may have to chug a mana potion as a paladin on occassion (shocking) but I preserve my dignity.
---
arena trinket sounds like tbc
---
In organized PvP you're IMO better as an Alliance Lock than Horde. Paladins cheaply and instantly dispel everything but curses you can throw out, you're in more of a utility role on Horde instead of a Shadowbolt turret like an Alliance Warlock, and Escape Artist is easily the best racial available for a Warlock (1min CD removes all snares/roots)
---
Not as black and white as people think. WotF is one factor among many
---
If I had to bet they will likely progress the servers to TBC and give people the option to transfer their Classic characters to a permanent Classic server.
---
Watching the rogue talents makes me miss hemorrhage so much
---
thats not the definition of difficutly. it just means youre class is tedious and incomplete
---
Some of the best times I've had were pushing masses of people back and forth between Tarren Mill and Southshore in world PVP
---
Esfand?
---
Ele is great in PvP, 30/0/21 is the prefered Shaman spec. If you plan on raiding Ele is gonna be a rough time but it is doable, you will go oom very quickly and won't do anywhere near as much DPS as pure DPS classes.
---
Enhancement is an auto attacker spec. You cast shocks, drop totems, and hope for windfury hits, that's it. It's also got terrible dps to boot and your only job in PvE is to apply the Nightfall debuff, which by the way can be done by Hunters or off tank Warriors much more efficiently.
---
How would you compare the story in Starcraft and SCBW to 40k? (I enjoy SC2 but its story sucked gigantic balls).
---
No, the gurubashi arena trinket. The holy Grail of all 19 twinks. Added in patch 1.11.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/item=19024/arena-grand-master
---
This brings me back...  I’m taking some time off work for Classic release, not because I need to race to 60, but because I need to stay ahead of the STV curve.
---
You can’t even tank 5 mans without being a huge annoyance to the group. And raids don’t even think about it.
---
Part is based on hearsay, some is min/maxing beyond what's needed. Not like druid is perfect, but still it can have it uses.
---
Yup just do all the night elf quests from 1 to 40. I do this on private servers all the time and I always hit exalted around 41-42.
---
but it's there again! Just try to open it.
---
www.thottbot.com
---
Muradin died in Northrend, betrayed by Arthas when arthas claimed (or rather, was claimed by) Frostmourne. At least, that was cannon in Vanilla. Also there's square brackets around this dude's name.
---
My idea for it was just that it was the Warsong map without the flags, and it was an open world zone.  Anyone could go into it, no population cap or teams.  If you were on a PVE server, you'd be flagged upon entering the zone.
---
You want to do premades? Then mana burn is is a must. 
---
Only interested in solo play? Then go for Inner Fire. It helps a ton against melee.
---
Remember that by going horde you have to face paladins in PvP, which are rather troublesome for warlocks as well. Don't force yourself to go Horde just because of a racial passive.
---
&gt; english isn't my mother tongue
---
We could tell fairly easily.
---
Keep in mind that we likely won't get BGs until several months or possible close to a year after launch, as the first BGs (WSG and AV) will not be released until Phase 3.
---
Hero'd replacement in the Mists of Pandaria revamp of Scarlet Halls.
---
Yes that would be dumb. You’re taking out 3 very strong talent points for a 1.5 seconds lower CD on mind blast.
---
Misdirect the tank
---
Any OCE gmt+8 guilds out there yet?
---
Looking to relive my vanilla glory days, with a late night (9pm gmt8 onwards) raiding crew - I know SG peeps are always pretty active around this time. Cheers!
---
It was patch 3.0. As much as its a cool idea, it didn't really last as much post Early Days of Wrath.
---
Wonderful pic!
---
Lay down  
---
Your sweet and weary head  
---
The night is falling  
---
You have come to journey's end  
---
Sleep now  
---
And dream of the ones who came before  
---
They are calling  
---
From across the distant shore  
---
Why do you weep?  
---
What are these tears upon your face?  
---
Soon you will see  
---
All of your fears will pass away  
---
Safe in my arms  
---
You're only sleeping  
---
What can you see  
---
On the horizon?  
---
Why do the white gulls call?  
---
Across the sea  
---
A pale moon rises  
---
The ships have come to carry you home  
---
And all will turn  
---
To silver glass  
---
A light on the water  
---
All Souls pass  
---
Hope fades  
---
Into the world of night  
---
Through shadows…
---
I did play a little vanilla but didnt hit max level and rerolled in TBC so i'll base my first character off of my TBC character, which was hunter.
---
I'm honestly probably gonna go Hunter again. I've tried other classes on Pservers but just nothing clicks with me like hunter does. Shaman does to an extent but I'm gonna be going Ally with my brother so that isn't an option for me.
---
Alterac Mountains isn't much of a zone currently anyway (great scenery though for what's there). I'd try to build AV but in Alterac Mountains. It'd be similar to 1.8 AV, with possibly even MORE neutral stuff in it, the big troll dude would be in it for sure, so it would take a while, and would reset daily and the rewards would be immense. 
---
There'd also be rewards for conquering SS, TM, and big rewards for killing faction bosses.
---
I fukin love trolls. Troll hunter and shaman are one of my fav race/class combos in game.
---
You want to spec resto for NS.
---
Back in vanilla hunter with T2 equip.
---
for classic the plan is shadow priest.
---
both horde
---
That was awesome!
---
Female dwarf paladin? I don't think i've ever seen one before.
---
I don't think blizzard had much choice. I'm pretty sure the activions overlords wanted someone more interested in scummy MTX.
---
*cries in warrior*
---
Orcs get bloodlust though which is fine for rogues as they shouldn't be needing healed nearly as much in raids and dungeons.
---
Took me 14 years to finally try hunter, now when I'm on priest I buff both. Knowledge is power.
---
Warriors (especially with engineering) are better AoE tanks than Druids, because shields are very good at mitigating small to medium attacks and shield spikes can help with initial threat. A Warrior can round up mobs in defensive stance with a shield + 1h, clump them together and afterwards the Mage can freeze and bomb them while the Warrior switches to a 2h weapon to deal AoE damage as well.
---
To be fair, no changes both includes battle masters AND zero battle masters. Both having them or not is vanilla Blizz-like. So it’s actually either or.
---
This is CLASSIC WoW, Warrior, Priest, and Mage were the "Holy Trinity". No one could tank better than a warrior, no one could heal better than a priest, and DPS wise no one could beat a mage with their DPS and CC. Mage CC was the best back then.
---
I knew I would find this idiotic comment in here. This has even debunked many times.
---
They did nerf it, in TBC.
---
Yes! I would like to get one as well, at least for the lower lvl zones
---
 Now when I think of it, Joanas guide covers first 10-15 lvls, after that it's not worth it due to the ress sick
---
And you just know some very low level character would run to him and start attacking/casting that he would inevitably resist/dodge due to level difference.
---
What coward chainmailed his head
---
Anyway, he'll have thin and patchy hair as a punishment. And \[Hammer of Justice\] from one of his mates
---
Cause its funny how entidled you have to be to start crying because you got ganked.
---
Again, dolphin &gt; you
---
Night Elf Druid will definitely be most popular on day one
---
I just want to see that dense forest filled to the crown with elves.
---
This is why you need to be extremely careful in Frostmane Hold...
---
&gt;no taunt no damage reduction
---
Those are pretty vital for a tank.
---
LOTR reference? Have an upvote!
---
Should have gone for engineering, instead of medicine.
---
Did you forget rogue CC?
---
I'm interested in a night elf only guild
---
So like Silvershard Mines but out in the world, and on a timer like Gurubashi arena?
---
I actually like that a lot.
---
Was Rogue
---
Rolling Druid
---
To tank instead of DPS
---
Calling combat ress low raid utility is hilarious.
---
Holy/Prot Paladin: You can level together extremely quickly, both get a free mount and you have someone who can tank/heal 5man dungeons and heal in raids.
---
World pvp on pve server is like sex where you need written consent form before you start.
---
No, but there arent many bosses in vanilla that actually crit *that* hard that it warrants gearing for defcap. Also, there is nothing as dangerous in a raid as bored healers.
---
I think with a 20lvl difference the polys should be resisted
---
Prot warrior who does no damage will just be ignored by melee while they kill the rest of your team. And you’ll get killed by ranged  without any concern. Unbridled rage is very low rage generation in pvp even when dual wielding and using flurry, so it will be almost non existent when using a shield without flurry. Improved berserker rage for rage generation is only useful when you’re super undergeared, as you open yourself to be feared while it is on CD. 
---
Lastly and most importantly, pvp without tactical mastery and you’re going to have a very bad time. No instant attacks means you’ll be relying on auto attack to hurt anything. Good luck
---
They actually admitted that there is to much loot during 8.2 preview.
---
I think thats the point. Its great PR on paper, but did they actually go through with it?
---
I think the reason why they'd never promise to do that nowadays is because they couldnt keep their promise before.
---
Having about 300 days/played combined as fury warrior I can attest that with proper gearing and consumable usage (which will increase your crit alot) your main concern will be getting a high dps OH or good stat OH. Speed will be of a minor concern.
---
You're both ridiculous.
---
They can't, unless they start promoting certain servers for a given faction, but that might backfire if people then deliberately roll on one with a high faction ratio.
---
It was before. When was this changed?
---
Hit items (either spell or normal) is VERY rare stat pre L60 gear. Almost non existent before L50 gear. As is mp5. And spirit is still nice for elemental as well as healing.
---
That was my main back then 😂
---
I did it purely for the questline pretty close to the BC prepatch. I had to re-farm and re-buy some of the Valor T0 pieces I already sold in order to be able to do it. it was quite fun!
---

---
Vanilla: warrrior
---
Classic: warlock.
---
Vanilla was my 1st mmorpg ever, so it was brutal as a warrior.
---
\- Let the bodies hit the floor
---
\- Down with the sickness
---
\- 10 000 fists (Disturbed, not Genesis)
---
\- Prayer of the Refugee 
---
\- American Idiot
---
\- In The End 
---
\- The Bad Touch
---
That should be a good start.
---
&gt;Now I am sure that Classic will be the only thing that keeps them alive.
---
Err, they aren't exactly hurting for money.
---
Love it, especially the loot tabel comment... so true
---
His argument perfectly makes sense. You are just acting like a fool.
---
Was that a problem with the idea of cappable world areas or with flying mounts and character balance in TBC though?
---
Haha, I remember that bug.
---
Ah. Spelled “rouge” like a true rogue.
---
Dual wielding instead of using a 2 hander or just a single 1 handed weapon increases your miss/dodge/parry chance by a shit ton. It's why hit% is vastly more useful for dual wielding melee than for 2h melee.
---
&gt; I was hoping to tank in raids. I used to MT as a Warrior but figured there's enough fights a Paladin should be able to offtank.
---
The best you can hope for as a paladin tank in a raid is trash packs and melee adds.
---
No taunt so tank swapping bosses are out. Bad mana efficency so long fights are out. Serious lack of gear so itemization is a nightmare. The talents require you getting crit to tank well. No burst aggro against anything that isnt an undead.
---
If the talents Redoubt and Reckoning change from "when you get crit" to "when you get hit", and if Blessing of Sanctity gains mp5, and if paladins get spell damage from strength, and if paladins get a taunt... Then things will have the semblance of warrior parity. 
---
Even with all those, paladins still have nearly no interactivity while tanking though.
---
Sweet fuck I can't stress this enough. Some people may want to do this but especially since I'll be joining weeks or months late due to assignment, first thing I'm going to do is find where they play and peace the fuck out of there and join a different server.
---
Paladin: Slow leveling.
---
Woah, here we have someone who haven't lvled up a Paladin in vanilla. They're NOT slow to lvl up.
---
most raid bosses are not taunt based so thats a poor reason. the mana and talent problems are legitimate ones.
---
To be fair no one saw any results so we don't know what we're getting. Words are just words. If enough people pre order Classic and it turns out to be garbage it's still profit in some cases like money grab with minimal effort.
---
Well, accord to Min/Max people you will never have anyone in your raid die even once. So more than 1 druid is not needed.
---
But having 3-4 battle ress can make you win that fight.
---
Honestly after the initial autismo wears off it won't be thaaaat bad, but there are going to be so many fuckers who like them that will be following them around in the world to try to help them, but moreso to try to ruin their experience via ganking, stealing mobs, killing quest turn in npc's, etc. Problem is, that will fuck it up for everyone else wanting to do that too so it'll just be an extra hassle to deal with for anyone caught in the crossfire.
---
Conjure fois/drink, portals, solid dps, always in demand in raids, in dungeon because of sheep, strong pve and pvp specs. Probably the best all around dps class if you are into range caster.

If you really don't know why someone would play a PvE server, I can only speak for myself here, but it's because vanilla PvP is just bad. You can paint a perfect image of glorious world PvP at its best, but more often than not it's just a waste of time with rock-paper-scissors matchups, fundamentally broken CC mechanics and a joke of a progression system.
---
I've had more than enough of it on private projects and am content with waiting until BC or Wrath to roll on a PvP server again. Vanilla PvP isn't worth the time, effort and resources for what I can squeeze out of it.
---
Truth lol
---
Dodge% and parry% are unaffected. They’re also not affected by hit.
---
Glancing blows happen vs anything equal or higher level. (you have a 10% chance +/- 2% of difference between your current level based weapon skill vs the enemy's level based defense skill).
---
Which means you never glance vs a lower level enemy but always have the chance to glance vs an equal or higher level one.
---
Only the damage penalty component is affected by bonus weapon skill.
---
The only thing that cares about a 3-4 level difference is Crushing Blows, which was +3 until the Wrath Prepatch since Blizzard gave up trying to figure out a way to make Paladins/Druids uncrushable without Shield Block and just raised the threshold to 4 levels of difference.
---
Yeah,  that's my usual thought process when trying to avoid world PvP. Never be the one to start the fighting, it's almost never worth it, especially with stealth classes. Even if you get rid of them for 2 mins you'll probably waste 10 mins later on killing each other back and forth.
---
Either they attack you and start a war, or you attack them and start a war, same result. On the other hand if you just leave them alone they could be chill and you can get your quest done in peace.
---
Won't they refuse to sell it to you? Saying you're too small, or something?
---
Blizzard has a weird patch numbers. 1.5 is actually earlier than 1.12. Same with 1.4
---
The more you know
---
Viable is hard to define. For non-speedrun/hardcore guilds there are many viable raid compositions available, because for a casual/semi-hardcore guild it is much more important to focus on stability, flexibility and diversity rather than clearing speed.
---
It is just a matter of how many you want to have in a guild for each. Some specs are more niche than others. The best example of this are Shadow Priests. It is always an increase in DPS for a raid to have 1 Shadow Priest as long as there are at least 3 Warlocks (the more the better), but a second one is not nearly as useful.
---
Another example is a Swiftmend Druid (Resto), they are fantastic for a raid but their HoTs don't stack, so you only want to have 1-2. The best case here is to have 1 Swiftmend Druid and every additional healing Druid is Moonglow specced.
---
The only two specs that I find hard to justify are moonkins and ret pallies. But a good moonkin druid or ret pally is sometimes a better choice than a weak standard DPS.
---
But that all said: Most guilds can't even make these choices really or don't want to and all content can be cleared with suboptimal compositions as long as it isn't too crazy.

Whats up with all these ”this wasnt a thing in Vanilla/BC”-posts lately?
---
Greykilling was more common in Vanilla/BC than in WoD.
---
top notch shitpost op
---
One of the best farm/solo classes in Vanilla, and definitely the best leveling class. DPS does not scale super well with gear so in later tiers you'll fall off but nevertheless hunters are needed everywhere because of kiting and tranq shot.  
---
You also have the best epic questline in the entire game, hands down.
---
I might have to plot them out and expand circles around each one to find potential borders. Sounds like hell to test though
---
Can’t wait to get bladestormed by Herod the Scarlet Chad again
---
I never gank people questing in the same area as me regardless of class, it always just ends up wasting time in the long run. Watching your back constantly and having to make sure your health/mana is always topped in case you get jumped is very time consuming.
---
Rammstein 24/7

That’s what I’m thinking. Perhaps a hosted private server.

Huuu not me ofc

Thanks matey. I thought it would be okay to have two crafting professions because Hunters seem to have a huge advantage in that they can solo farm instances like Maraudon for gold. I'm not convinced gathering professions like herbalism will be all that great for the first month or two because of the lack of gold. Admittedly I don't really have experience on a fresh server like that.

_- Xshotzulol, Hunter, 2 days before being found floating in the canals, with a T2 Shoulder embedded in his skull. SW Police is investigating, but not too hard._
---
A HotW specced druid can both heal and off-tank even in raids. And with good gear they can even tank bosses.
---
They are not as good at tanking as feral druids or as good at healing as resto/moonglow druids, but with a proper gear swap they are decent at both.
---
Example build: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxxhscMdxVxf0xo
---
As a healer they have a 20% larger mana pool than resto druids but lack some efficiency and burst heal talents. They can heal perfectly fine though and are better than resto druids at purely decursing/dispelling poisons.
---
As tanks they are identical to ferals in terms of mitigation/health but they are weaker in terms of threat and damage.
---
The build is also good for PvP, especially since PvP gear is hybrid friendly, you get pieces with high stats in all directions, which greatly synergizes with this build.
---
I got mine. Feralheart was a nice farming set, and I liked the design (aside for the helm which I hid).
---
I got most of Deathmist set for my lock as well but then TBC hit and it just kind of got lost in the shuffle.
---
After Wrath launched i did end up going back and getting most of them completed.
---
Whats progressive questing mate?
---
There is a special place in hell for Hunters Ninjaing that axe. It's called "Will be required to watch Ashkandi going to a Ret."
---
Female ud beats anything. Ill do a frontflip, kill ya,  and feast on your bones HAHAHHAHA
---
I'm basically a pacifist while leveling, avoid conflict at all costs. I just wanna level, man.
---
At max level though it's open season.
---
Grey helmet, noob
---
I read the Silmarillion a few months ago and man - I'd recommend it! To delve into thousands of years of history preceding the events of LotR, it's a great read. ***Definitely something to pick up before Classic comes out!***
---
Just make sure Wand Specialization and Spirit Tap are the first talents you get, after that it's not a big deal until 40. I went only 8-12 points deep in shadow and put the rest in healing talents and I was fine. The healing talents probably help you more at low levels out in the world anyway. I remember doing very well in open world PvP in fights I wasn't outnumbered or grossly outleveled. But at 40... man at 40, YOU will be the one others will be worried about. You can take down warriors 4 levels higher in the open world, you WANT to be on a PvP realm as a shadow priest from 40-59.
---
You should also be able to heal just fine as shadow if you know what you're doing. I went holy at 60 but found myself switching back to shadow for pre-raid dungeons so I could fill either the dps or healer role. Would need to use mana potions more often and be carefully efficient with your mana, like downranking and being very selective with your usse of PW:S, Flash Heal, Prayer (which was a great challenge and preparation for raiding anyway). Even in BGs, I would mostly end up healing in PUGs because there was usually a shortage, but it was great having the option to pop into shadowform when I was in a 1v1 situation - which obviously includes world PvP versatility too.
---
If it were such a big deal wouldn’t people say the same about gnomes and mages? 
---
I dunno why alliance lose, but let’s be honest demons commanded by undead sounds cool as fuck.
---
True. You might want to roll engineering for explosives and Alchemy for mana pots to fill the mentioned weak spots.

RestoSham looking for a dedicated group of people to go a little bit crazy with. I will be rushing that 60 with \~18 hours a day and then dial it down a little. PM me for a chat or answer here.
---
I was thinking the same.   Mechanical strider and ram only for gnome no?
---
That's the difference, really. 40k has a very fleshed out universe. SC doesn't bother with anything outside the games. I would recommend checking out "The Vaults of Terra" on Youtube for more but I'll give an inadequately short synopsis.
---
Jesus is real; he's an ageless being with psychic powers that has been watching mankind since the stone age. Mankind discovers how to travel faster then light and spreads across the stars. The dimension that we use to travel gets royally fucked up when a powerful entity is born within it, cutting off FTL travel. Earth, which has come to depend on interstellar imports, becomes a wasteland. Space Jesus conquers earth by creating genetically augmented super soldiers in power armor and starts a crusade to reunite humanity. One of his top generals goes rogue and cripples him to the point he has to be put on permenant life support. The game is set 10k years later.
---
Valathak and Baron Run are largely party coordination challenges. Learn the fights, practice, and you win. 
---
Over-gearing can help cover some mistakes but isn't strictly required, especially since 1 person doing the wrong thing on Valathak can potentially wipe you.
---
My first tabard, felt like the coolest kid
---
Replying for ref later 😏
---
Hey it worked for me, along with a “pay it forward” request from the guild member who gave it to me. Felt good when I finally had enough to help that next person out
---
Did you happen to play vanilla as Exiled back in the day?
---
&gt;That's the difference, really. 40k has a very fleshed out universe. SC doesn't bother with anything outside the games. I would recommend checking out "The Vaults of Terra" on Youtube for more but I'll give an inadequately short synopsis.
---
The SC books were okay back in the day. Liberty's Crusade is great, and Shadow of the Xel Naga is pretty good.
---
That said, I love your writeup here, that sounds really cool.
---
**DEFINITELY night elf.**
---
The female night elf animations are awesome, ESPECIALLY doing flips when you jump.
---
And shadowmeld... SUPER underrated.  Let's say you're leveling and you come to a spot where you have to kill a named mob but oh no! He's dead and you you need to wait until he respawns.  Find a nice hill or bush, shadowmeld, go to the bathroom, grab a snack or a drink, and come back.  Minimal risk of getting ganked while you afk in the open world, a very unique quality-of-life ability. 
---
Also, stealth-Aimed Shot combo is not only an insane opener if you have the patience, but also fucking hilarious when you hit a clothie lol.
---
The other way around, mechabostride is dwarf and gnome only, but gnomes have no restrictions.
---
Adding new quests each patch. Private servers like to do this but Classic will have all quests at start.
---
prot pally, prob aoe grind, also reckoning on a pvp server, should be fun.
---
Tauren is restricted though correct?
---
I'm just replying to the best response for the sake of most of these threads being downers for Druid players: tanks are always needed, half the warriors that claim to tank don't and will just be fury monkeys that aren't willing to take on the job. I'd take a dedicated Bear Tank over a half-assed warrior any day of the week!  
---
Skarm Tank has some useful videos on Bear Tanks that can be proof counter to the Feral haters, check out his channel:  [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5xSfo5nMGSmv00sGpRN7SQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5xSfo5nMGSmv00sGpRN7SQ)   
---
It requires a bit of effort on the player to be the true hybrid tho.
---
That’s awesome you did this. I’m rolling Dwarf Priest and this is great info to have.
---
I remember it being worse on recent pservers than back in vanilla... that may or may not have to do with my own immaturity level back then. It was just a magnet for that type of chat because it was where 3 of the 4 horde races naturally went (and probably more undead there than in Silverpine). And was gigantic so it had all 4 races covering levels 10-27 or so. 3 dungeons, a boat, and a huge zone that required a lot of walking and auto-walking, so a lot of people waiting for stuff and ready to chat. Also given the low level, there were a ton of people who were generally slower at leveling (because a lot spent their time talking instead of grinding, or they were immature kids that took forever to level, hence spent weeks in The Barrens). Add all that up and you get Barrens Chat.
---
I played druid in vanilla and I felt useless. It's not that battle rez wasn't useful but that it was the only thing worthwhile about druids in raids.
---
Don't worry about consumables when picking between these two.
---
Both mages and rogues have a lot of options to burn money / farming time into min-maxing and both have a lot of options for making money to achieve that.
---
This. It's cringy in many Vanilla PVP videos you see someone 1v2 or 1v3 with 1 healer in the group that never heal ...
---
DPS win fights. If you dead no DPS. Heals make you no dead :o
---
Glad you chose! I wish I could say the same. Every week I think I'm set for sure, and then the next week I change my mind once more.

Stoneform breaks blind, which is huge against a rogue.
---
1.5s mb cd for 3 talent points is shit. If you could have put those 2 you spent somewhere else you would have.
---
Shadow will be nuked pretty quick in team fights. You don’t have any way to escape except for 1 fear. And you have to get closer than other Casters to use mf. Mb uses a lot of mana, mf doesn’t and slows. Chaining mb mf mf mb mf...is mana intensive. Making the cd quicker makes it cumbersome, less mana efficient and for pvp often pointless. 
---
Mana regeneration and life leech are way more important
---
Look at all those fat teenage girls. Fuck me. Lose some weight

I had a max level hunter and priest. Both were awesome but I'm thinking warlock this time around. I main a lock on retail now and id like to see how it was in vanilla. Plus free level 40 mount so i can have some extra gold for spells and professions
---
Is there a difference between being ganked a few times and being ganked to the point that you can't even level passed 20? Because the latter is what was being called for, which sounds like an important distinction that even I, at my below dolphin level of awareness, seem capable of making.
---
Its pretty fucked up that on a subreddit which is dedicated to being excited about a game there are people instead getting excited at the prospect of the game being ruined for some people because they stream.
---
I played an orc warrior in vanilla and BC up to level 70. I’ve been testing out Druid and hunter in retail up to level 20 (when it’s still free) just to get a feel for them. I’m leaning towards rolling Druid for my main since you can solo pretty easily but also want to heal which is why I’ve been considering priest as well. Can’t decide between the versatility of the Druid or pure healing power of the priest
---
Who’s the dude above the chainmail dude? Asking for a friend.

I mailed a night elf rogue in vanilla and it was amazing.  I only wish I rolled female for that phat booty.

&lt;**UNITY**\&gt; \[**OCEANIC**\] \[**Alliance**\] \[**PVP**\]
---
**Introduction**: We are an Australian based guild, with a few others around the world in our time zone. We welcome anyone who will be playing Classic Wow as an Alliance character. 
---
**Discord**: [https://discord.gg/TWnNpEs](https://discord.gg/TWnNpEs)
---
**Realm: Oceanic** (realm TBA once the list is available)
---
**Realm Type**: PVP
---
**Faction**:  Alliance
---
**Region**: AUS - Oceanic
---
**Time zone**: Australian Eastern Daylight Time
---
**Guild Type**: Semi-hardcore
---
**Loot Rules**: Loot council.
---
**Raiding Times**:  Weekends and some week nights - Again not set in stone but more than likely 6pm-12pmish. At the moment there looks to be multiple raids due to numbers. We will not restrict classes until after launch
---
**Intention**: We prioritize raiding and dungeons, PVP is secondary but will still be promoted.
---
**What We Expect Of Members**: Standard Non-Harassment Rules.  Just try to be respectful of the guild, have fun but not at someone else's expense. 
---
\*You don't need to be a raider to join either, while some of us will be taking time off at launch from work, many of us promote a work life balance especially those with families (myself included). If you are interested in joining just pop in the channel and write to us or message me directly on Discord.
---
Don't get Divine Spirit for PvP. Very mana costly and often too little of a benefit in mana regen. PvP is much more often about burst/tempo/timeliness than sustainment/attrition.
---
I’ve got a similar schedule myself. 90 min commute one way and I work from 5:30 pm to 4:45 am. I’m lucky enough to have a set schedule of Tuesday through Friday but there don’t seem to be many guilds who are trying to raid on weekends let alone the hours I’m available (having a family means I can really only play after they’ve all gone to bed). I’ve pretty much come to terms with the fact I’ll be sticking to mostly 5 mans and the occasional PUG if I’m to raid at all. I’ll probably spend a lot of time leveling alts as well.
---
Rolled Priest and Paly on launch (EU) and stayed with them up to Panda Land. Took a break. Emigrated. Boost on both those classes for Legion and BFA.
---
For Classic I’ll be rolling...Priest and Paly.
---
The way TBC did it.
---
I was a hunter and definitely had the axe.
---
However, this was because I chain-ran those dungeons for like 10 levels because they were just so damn fun.
---
Then your guild did something wrong. Our 2nd MT was a druid since a lot of fights are optimal for druid tanks (in AQ40 you kind of need warriors, but with AQ40 gear a druid is up to par again), he either healed or DPSed otherwise. We also had 2 healing druids that did a hell of a good job (according to healing meters) keeping all DPS on top health with HoTs.
---
Even in a Min/Max guild you should feel worthwhile if you're the feral druid.
---
Hmm... you were a teenager during vanilla and now you’re old? Some days I hate the internet.
---
Oh, and get off my lawn!

Will TF Bindings drop in Phase 1 ?
---
I preferred tailoring and enchanting. Neither requires a gathering profession to level and u get some pretty good use out of both throughout. It's a little tough not having a gathering profession to make money off of but I managed pretty good without
---
On arthas we had a pvp night. The top raiding guilds organized it. 
---
They held it in a region within a zone, 5-8 5 man teams per faction. They rode on mounts and roamed looking for each other then charged in and had at it. People kept score and folks from around the server came to spectate. 
---
A few guys filmed it. There’s a video somewhere. 
---
Happened 3 times. Then naxx and how competitive it was broke up the server. All the top guilds left when free transfers to mal’ganis—with new server technology—opened. 
---
Basically only rules were no crashing other fights, no professions—class skills/equipped item skills only.
---
There were often midnight arena tournaments after the wsg groups broke up
---
I'm not sure mages had the best DPS. It was a combination of good ranged DPS with AoE, CC and Utility that made them popular in DPS slots.
---
Rogue, both Night Elf and Undead. Later on Shaman.
---
This time around, Horde Warrior. Going to learn how to Tank, I want the added responsibility and keen to share my vanilla experience in leading groups. Also instead of spending hours looking for a group, I'll be able to dictate when I run dungeons.
---
They were in MC from the start, so probably.
---
I’m maining Dwarf Priest but my alt Human Paly will be right behind for PvP. Love how the tabards look on Human Palys, you cant see em on my Dwarf cos of the beard.
---
Who put mortal strike on the boss???!!
---
I've always been a warrior but I got tired of slow leveling every single expansion... So I'll probably roll a vending machi- a mage in classic.
---
I like your outside the box thinking, but aggressively avoiding damage talents is not the same as building a very defensive build. Going that deep into Fury and skipping Flurry is a mistake, even if you're not a damage dealer, that's too big of a value to pass up and hope to stay competitive. You're never going to put your defense to the test if you're doing so little damage that it's never worth focusing you. Your hunter CC build has arguably less CC than the standard hunter build with Intimidation and Scatter Shot which also does a lot more damage. One day deep into the end game with a ton of gear I will experiment with some stuff like this for a weekend or so, but don't get your hopes up about a full-time PvP spec. Originality introduces a new challenge and some fun, though.
---
Bet you’re red in the face.

Man I want a dwarf femsle hunter but shadowmeld is so fun in pvp :(

I heard they were added in Patch 1.3?

We all do.

Isn't holy wand build the fastest way to level till level 40 then switch to Shadow? So you are following the meta level build

This will also be possible in Classic WoW. And it will be even easier than on private servers.
---
If you are too poor to afford $15 a month for recreation, then you should be focused more on career building than gaming tbh.
---
Yes.
---
i knew it.
---
”Why is there no trueshot aura in group 4?”
---
But in a BG scenario as a healer I feel a Priest would be much easier to kill than a Druid. So Druid wins again!!
---
Or take up pan handling ^nakid ^on ^a ^mailbox
---
Dwarf is master race though
---
This I can get behind
---
Its different for some bosses, idk why this guy got a downvote who commented. Some bosses have punishing blows that hit hard when you dodge them or harder at certain parts. So some bosses require a high defense or using defense and damage reduction cd's at the time they would "crush" you.
---
I’m (Priest) gonna take Enchanting and Leatherworking. Bank the cloth and leather (for bags). Drop Leatherworking at 60 and train up Tailoring.
---
No one is pity buying you a sub
---
🙂
---
I was thinking about doing that but the free extra gold from skinning is too enticing. My goal is to have my first mount right at 40, but then again I could always just sell portals/food/water for a day and get it lol!
---
Unless it was a druid, shifting out of roots and being immune to polymorph.
---
And yet I still look forward to playing my big beautiful bastard Tauren Druid!
---
Druids are viable raid tanks with enough work out into them. If you are looking for a hybrid class
---
As much as I love taurens, for pvp i would go orc. Tauren is just too damm big
---
The fact that it wasn't in vanilla
---
Just sell nudes on Instagram like a thot

I love your username

they tried with cavern of time. I would have liked more somewhere else. Why not have another halo on type fight in cata? Walk our happy asses back to northrend?
---
Or put zul aman in hinterlands. 
---
But it all made sense at the time. In January of 07 I wanted to be in Outland not Azeroth.
---
I'm asking how long it will take to farm out gold you fucking dumbass

Or maybe I'm a kid from a poor family and you still aren't answering my question. So don't comment at all tbh????

# The Argent Vanguard
---
**DnD style, Argent Dawn-themed Roleplay**
---
* **Region:** EU
---
* **Server Type:** RP
---
* **Faction:** Alliance
---
* **Play Times:** Varied.
---
* **Priorities:** Leveling &gt; Roleplay &gt; Dungeons
---
* **Particular Rule:** Willingness to engage in both organized &amp; random Roleplay.
---
* **Contact:** discordapp.com/invite/BGQ4Z9e
---
# Introduction; In-Universe
---
The Vanguard, commonly known as the ‘Argent Spear’ was originally created in order to allow the Dawn to strike at foes in the farthest corners of the plaguelands of Lordaeron.
---
Over the years as they gradually discovered the agents of both the Burning Legion and the Scourge have spread to the civilized regions of the world, the Dawn started deploying them as an expeditionary force.
---
Nowadays they are known to operate all across Azeroth. Anywhere evil rears its ugly head, they will be there to meet it.
---
# Introduction; Out of Character
---
The Argent Vanguard aims to be the premier roleplaying destination for all your Argent Dawn themed roleplaying needs on Classic WoW.
---
We will offer:
---
* Weekly events &amp; multi-part campaigns.
---
* A commendation system for tracking player achievements.
---
* A defined path of progression, with multiple platoons &amp; roles to fill.
---
* Our own, home-brew RPG system for events.
---
* Discord server.
---
Our Roleplay will be grounded in canonical lore, with our events taking place during the Vanilla timeline. This does not mean however that concepts expanded upon and introduced in later expansions can’t be introduced into our stories, within reason.
---
We wish to emphasize persistence through our Roleplay, so we will often spend long periods of time away from major Roleplaying hubs, even outside of guilds events.
---
We also wish to manage &amp; maintain a PvE &amp; PvP wing of the guild to fully exploit the content offered by the game.
---
With the Vanguard there will be no downtime, always having something to do.
---
There was also a guild called Eternal Ownage if i remember correctly - they were running with a warrior named Anise.
---
F
---
From my experience very close to 99% yeah
---
Warriors might generate more threat than druids againt 5+ mobs, but druids can apply hots to themselves and have more mitigation = they won't die against the pack while the mage AOEs them down.
---
Toaster looks like he is ready to take Jerusalem.
---
Never played retail, but I’m sure there are get rich quick guides on youtube. Not sure this sub is the right place for the question though. Good luck!
---
Then u never had a seriously good Prot paladin in ur raid, that's it. But that's exactly what I'm talking about. It's hard to play it good enough to make it viable, u literally just confirmed what i said.
---
Virgin Herod; Posts low resolution meme
---
Yes. Do you have a max level?
---
And wouldn't playing retaila sub anyway (just confused)
---
Yeah, I get that's what you're asking on the surface.
---
But it's obvious as fuck that you're fishing for a benefactor.
---
I did skinning and tailoring. You’ll be swimming in leather and cloth. Tailoring is just good because some of the prebis stuff are from tailoring. Skinning is just increasing your gold per minute.
---
Dwarf is master race
---
This is one of the reasons what makes them hard to play.
---
Repost
---
Low lvl ganking/greykilling is OK on a pvp realm. If you dont like that kind of stuff, play on a pve realm (thats the main point of pve realms anyway).
---
I had a horrrible time lvling in late vanilla with all the ganking. I still remember the frustration caused by pink haired gnome rogs in hillsbrad, the "car chase like" encounter in desolace against a hunter with epic mount, calling for help in winterspring and actually causing a mini BG in the zone etc etc. Hell even in tbc, when lvling my mage alt, I had so many high lvl gankers on me (the difference was I could log my main in full gladiator gear and wipe the floor with the greykiller rats, including their buddies called in for 1v2, 1v3. Then I would abandon lvling, stay in the zone for hours with my main an annihilate everyone on sight, be it low or high lvl...)
---
And what wpvp do I remember after vanilla/tbc? Nothing. 
---
You dont have that kind of happenings in retails anymore. As I said, if you dont dig that stuff, play on a pve realm. Ofc you can bully pvp in the general chat for doing so, but this gives more depth to the mmo experience as well ("better" and "worse" ppl in the same faction). Not to mention that you memorize the name of your gankers, and when you turn high lvl... well time for the revenge.
---
I'v been struggling with the same question for some time now and I'v come to decision: Both racials are awesome for shaman and its impossible to tell which one would be overall better. 
---
So I'am making my roll based on models and animations. At the moment that means going with orc male, cast animations are just so nice and shaman gear on orc means looking like champ all the time. Also orcs look nice on almost every horde mount etc.

Why should mythic raiders in 2019 be wanting to go crush mechanically simplistic MC for a shot at an—appearantly—overtuned and forever powerful TF? When the new content Blizzard is making is (even at its worst) miles better than mc.

I want to raid through classic for real again cause it’s been forever cause I didn’t finish naxx. The content is hard by virtue of the limitations of the game. But we have 15 years of theory crafting. 15 years of having killed the bosses. 100,000,000 people’s collective game knowledge.
---
I can out play the shit outta myself from 06. But I am not excited for classic because I get to do mc ~120 times.
---
It's what people have been talking about for the last few months, but it was certainly unusual to see people in Holy Spec back in the day when they werent 60.
---
I dont see a need to accomodate the honor system. Ignoring the fact that it is deeply flawed in itself, it doesnt really get better or worse by removing battlegrounds.   
---
The obvious replacement for BGs would be non instanced pvp objectives in high level areas. Mostly empty areas like Azshara would greatly benefit too.   
---
The objectives themselves should have a bit more variety than what Vanilla/TBC offered. "Stand here until the area us in your control. Repeat." isnt exactly engaging. Wotlk with Wintergrasp and its vehicle controls were too much however. What I would propose is taking single elements of these mechanics and polish them. One example: The night elves defend some ancient ruines in Azshara. The horde wants to destroy them. How can you destroy them? Find an engineer to craft some bombs (limited carrying capacity) to blow the ruins up. The alliance tries to repair them before they are completely destroyed, so better ask a good miner to get you some stones. And chop of some horde heads.
---
All of them,  probably all of them again.
---
Nah I don't have a lvl 120 and is it true the game is now free up to lvl 110?
---
Haha it won't be easier, it will be harder. Pserver reputation is overblown.
---
I doubled-checked Wowpedia, they were introduced in 1.6 (BWL Patch). So that probavbly means Phase 3.
---
Im confused, you dont have money but want to pay for a month of BfA to potentionally get one free month for Classic?
---
Nobody really cared about the areas. And also yes, flying made wpvp very awkward.
---
That’s some way to celebrate the launch of Classic!
---
I heard the game was free up to lvl 110 and I'm sure I can farm at lvl 110
---
I once had a belt drop with double stacked strenght on it for my paladin. I was unstoppable.
---
Mage. Mage. Because mage.
---
Most of the good ranged weapons end game are crossbows, so your +5 bow skill is useless then.
---
Sell it on Grindr with that premium snapchat.
---
I was so sure I was going to play druid in classic! Godamnit!
---
I think its only up to 20. You get all wow until Legion if you buy the box. But free its only until lvl 20 to my knowledge
---
Not true, pally can tank instances like strat easily. But pally tank requires mana, so if you have all melee it can slow your group a bit. His aoe threat is way better than anything else, tho. Meaning mages etc can just aoe everything down.
---
For some reason I thought they changed it so it's free up to 110 recently...weird
---
Well, they admitted that there was much more loot than it used to be. They didn't indicate that they thought that it was too much.
---
thanks that was very insightful, i no longer feel salty about ignoring imp mind blast and the build looks perf now
---
That's because of the amount of knowledge people have now about a 15 year old game
---
Don't you mean sentry totem?
---
To answer your question: yes, you can farm gold for a sub in a relatively short time. However, if you can't afford a sub when classic launches why would you be able to afford it now?
---
You're asking a question with little to no context. Do you have a level 120 character on retail? Do you have the time to farm 200k+ each month? Do you have any ideas how you are going to farm the gold?
---
The regular sub let's you level up to 110. If you buy BfA, you can get a level 110 boost to any character. Max level is where you really want to make the money - alchemy, maybe?

I don't have a 120 char but I have a lot of time to farm. I'll look up gold farming guides.
---
lol
---
But was this a thing in vanilla, or just on private servers?
---
Im playing on a pserver now with skinning &amp; tailor while leveling. Feels rly nice and easy to maintain/doing while leveling.
---
Not stupid to have an alt for the tailoring mats tho, it’s quite a lot as u prob know
---
Private server reputation is nerfed. Classic reputation grind will be a joke.
---
Is there any way to farm gold for a sub without paying a sub.
---
I did collect it on my Paladin.
---
Child pr0n nah.

If you want to tank 5 man’s just make a Druid. If you actually want to tank why are you dead set on having a bad time? Is it like dating a black guy cause your dad once made a comment? 
---
Raiding your mana problem is fights last too long. In 5 man’s the mobs sap your mana. You’ve got no taunts and pulls often have 4-5 mobs making it easy for anyone to pull one off you and you have a hard time getting it back. 
---
Can it be done? Sure. Does it require your group—all 4–to change their play style? Again yes. Is it nearly as effective holistically as a tank. No. Is there gear designed for this specbeyond scholomance? Not really. 
---
I mean the spec is built around getting crit, the very thing tank gear is aimed at preventing from happening. 
---
It has cool pieces, none of them work together. 
---
If you want to tank, just make a warrior or a Druid if you want hybrid status.
---
o o f
---
I wouldnt call pally a buffbot, you are the best tank healer in the game with some of the best CD's. You can spam flash heals, freeing priests more to group healing role in alliance. With BWL+AQish gear you can spam 1000+ HP (non crit) heals every 1.5s never going oom on bossfights. With naxx gear i dont think you can EVER go oom.
---
Man seriously, the "career" comment is honestly not a bad one. Like, if you get a job it'll take you an hour or two to earn the fifteen bucks for one month of sub. Think about how much longer that'll take in game. Plus you can afford a better computer with a job too, and help out your poor family.
---
I'm just saying, think about it.
---
Depends on to much variables but check this sub /r/woweconomy/ and guides on Youtube. 
---
I made at the start of each xpack (since MoP) around 3 Subs a month, with bfa i raised it to 5 but i really do not know how the prices are now and without BFA you have to flip the AH or farm Transmog (slow selling) because you can not farm the mats for raid pots and enchants.
---
Best farming i do when current mats do not sell well is Ghost iron Ore from Mop. Do this till you have aroun 100k-200k and then start flipping the AH. I have no idea were you come from or what Region you play but it can be better to sell the Gold on specific Plattform (i have no idea if i can mention them here)
---
Too poor for 50cents a day? $15 can easily be spent a day at one fast food joint.
---
Take to mowing lawns, shoveling snow, cleaning gutters, racking leaves and picking up sticks. 
---
Hell offer to walk a dog once a week for $5 and you will have enough.
---
- The side with the most weekly HKs in a certain zone (changes every week) gets a week-long bonus. Say something like 10% xp boost, 10% more gold dropped, 10% chance of profession nodes dropping more than normal.
---
- Make certain towns capturable (a more involved process than the Nagrand one in TBC though, have guards and stuff, more like old-school AV) and have a town-specific faction that you can only grind rep with when you control the town. Have that faction give highly competitive rewards similar to the higher-ranked Honour System rewards.
---
The base game is free up to 110, you still have to pay for subscription. You can play to level 20 without paying anything.
---
It is free to level 20.

Can confirm.

I used to be a rogue and pretend I was minding my own business.

Rogues are constantly thinking about murdering everyone.

## Le codpiece substantielle
---
I personally loved playing on a PvE server, and plan on playing on one again in Classic. 
---
A few reasons. 
---
1. I ain't got time for that getting ganked shit. I have a family and full time job so my gaming time in general is limited anyway. I want to spend the time I have with the game. Playing the game. And I know that PvP is part of the game, but I want to play against the game, more than against other players.  Make sense? 
---
2. I always had respect for those who flagged themselves on a PvE server. Flagging yourself showed your Allies and your enemies you volunteer as tribute. Your willing to play ball. I played an alliance paladin that only did raiding and dungeons, and an undead rogue that only did battlegrounds and world PvP. I loved flagging myself in the moment on my paladin to lay on hands a nearly lifeless gnome Mage being wrecked by an Orc warrior.  And also pre flagging myself on my rogue to show my Allies I'm willing to fight for them and welcoming enemies to try their chance at taking me down. I liked giving them first shot because well fighting other people was my main goal on that character.... And I liked giving them a chance ;). So yeah I'm looking forward to the experience of playing against the game when I want to and playing against other people when I want to.
---
You will not need alchemy as a tank. herbing/skinning or mining/skinning is best to make gold while leveling. As soon as you are 60 you can skip skinning for Ingi. You actually will need lots of herbs for Buffmats and lots of arcanite and darkironto craft tank items. I will go with Mining/Ingi because I will do tons of brd for Ironfoe and other nice items there. I will also run a twink for herbing on a second account to camp lotus spawns while raiding.
---
Healer if you plan on raiding so you can pretty much get guaranteed raid slots.
---
I remember fighting  this hunter in AV and a rogue was stealthing nearby just doing nothing
---
Absolutely not.
---
Arathi?
---
Yes, but not sure if it's for mount vendors too, or only for riding skill. Back then, riding skills were racial (Night Elf Riding, Gnome Riding), and you couldn't learn to ride other race's mounts - but I don't know if you could buy the mounts themselves, probably not.
---
I recall taking a dwarf to the gnome riding trainer, because he was closer to Ironforge, only to find out that "I am just too large".
---
Which server is this from ?
---
Stop assuming that I can find a normal job in my country. You probably aren't from a third world country and will never know the struggles everyone here goes through. And I DO have a shitty job that gets me 60 bucks a month but it all goes to my family.
---
1.6 was the BWL Patch when you could actually finish the questline (because of the Elementium needed). I am pretty sure the bindings droped prior to BWL but you couldn't finsih the quest.
---
Thank you!
---
Find a 1.2 speed cat you (and they) won't see the difference.
---
How about you play something that appeals to you on a personal level? Don't try to pick best race/class minmaxer just to hate it.
---
And the best ranged weapons in end game are crossbows too.
---
Lmao I’d have to check my yearbook later I don’t know his name off the top of my head

turns out most specs using 2 engineering items per fight can beat specs that don't use any engineering at all. Who knew?

Originally wanted to roll an undead rogue in vanilla but ended up being a dwarf rogue and human warrior in vanilla because of Alliance friends.
---
Am currently a human warrior in retail.
---
Will roll an undead rogue in Classic. The same reason I had 14 years ago: enchanted dual sword animations look bad ass on an undead rogue.
---
or ambushing an unsuspecting player that won't see you in time to react.

yeah i was thinking the same, sounds like something i would like to do on a RP-PVP

Capturable Towns, with full quest hubs, flight masters, and vendors, who some useful consumables for hardcore raiding and PvP.
---
So, imagine a tug of war scenario, similar to the towers in EPL, but with... let's say 7 stages of control (Full Alliance/Horde Control, Partial Alliance/Horde Control, Horde/Alliance Advantage, Neutral).
---
If you have more members of your faction in the town compared to the opposing faction  (including NPCs and lowbies, but not pets), the town will drift towards your faction's control. However, in order to reach Partial Control, you need twice as many of your faction as your opponent, and in order to reach Full Control, you need four times as many.
---
When you achieve Partial Control, guard NPCs from your faction can begin spawning in to help secure the area. And at full control, you get the vendors and quest givers and such. They don't despawn when control drops below this point, but they won't respawn once they die.
---
The idea is to bias the town so it remains fairly stable once one side achieves full control, and requires a major attack from the opposite faction to switch sides, with an emphasis on sheer quantity of players, rather than scoring kills or competing with your own faction over limited resources.
---
Then the tank and healer leave group and reform, LF1M DPS. Filled in an instant.
---
get a job?
---
yeah then bring the hunter as an alt to gold farm on, and no alt runs
---
Fair points! Thanks for your insight &amp; constructive criticism.

Ho man spent hours camping those hellfire towers Farming those stones for the noobie gems and fingers. Felt so good once i had everything. Delayed my leveling but totally worth it. One of the best memories i have from tbc are on those 3 towers

Druids have *less* mitigation against multiple mobs because they don't have a shield. Blocking attacks removes a small amount of damage from it, which is great if you are attacked by a lot of mobs that don't hit hard. Druids have other, unique advantages, because they have thorns and the barkskin+hurricane combo.
---
As I told you in the other thread, they were introduced in 1.6.
---
Well the dude is pve so i think human with sword passif is way better
---
does that include skinning or purely drops?
---
I don't understand how being immune to polymorph or shifting out of roots makes you good at CC.
---
I know a lot of people do not like them but in the Progress of WoW Warsong was the first (for people not being 51+) BG so it was okay to have everyone there ( a lot o f skirmishes happend and was really great fun). 
---
After reaching max level and playing AV most combined it with some SS vs TM wars but with ARathi i think it is just awefull to run to every portal.
---
No it makes mages not so good, if it's vs a druid
---
I agree there. Shadow is about the slow burning multiple enemies while you control them through kiting / fear / Mc / mana burn (dispel if used correctly is a form of mana burn too) etc.  The extra CD on your MB just eats away at your mana (and your health if you forgo VE) for nominal increase in damage as it’s not consistent with your spell rotations timers anyways. It is also effected less by +spell damage compared to SWP / MF . I would say it’s situationally good but I your mileage will be better elsewhere.
---
PServer rep doesn't have spillover, so it's actually harder to get Exalted. And the rep values on the serious servers are largely correct.
---
The one that you're gonna play more.
---
I’m sure as hell gonna greykill, and when they bring their mains, I’m gonna kill them as well, and then when you, the white knight decides to show up, you’re also dead. Come at me bro
---
mage, priest and if a very good weapon, warrior.
---
If you go under 5% HP its a healer problem. 
---
Go for orc.
---
but there are also jobs in fucking bulgaria
---
Nah dwarf is master race
---
Smh
---
Personally im struggling picking any of all classes. Priest being my least wanted one. Im the oldest of my "gamingcrew" and Im quite sure Im destined to be one of the responsibility classes (i.e tank or healer) incase I roll healer I will go for Shaman. At the end of the day they got beautiful tier sets, Chainheal which is the greatest heal in the game(yeah I said it) they also have some nische role in different aspects like melee capability (outside raid) and a ghettomage setup(very strong in pvp tho). Remember though that priest have the ability to dominate any 1v1 fight in world pvp, nice looking/good tier sets.

---
There's another thread from yesterday talking about the same thing (except as a human, which would obviously be easier). Check that out - it's got a lot of tips, links, and recommendations.
---
i never played alliance but night elf looks cool
---
Thanks again. Still unknown though in which Phase they implement it.
---
Why wouldn't we assume? You're making a rather controversial post, with little to no context, and an already loaded question, and expecting fully fleshed out answers for your question which is very easily answered by googling.  Making your title something suggestive "too poor for classic" is basically asking for people to come in an analyze your financial situation, and opens the door for assumptions to be made.
---
I think they had good plans with the EPL Towers and the Buffs and without BGs this system could have expanded to other zones and maybe even reach Capitals with getting buffs and lower repairing cost or something like that. 
---
Warhammer Online had a cool Region lock System so the regions got on Cooldown and people had to move on.
---
Nah, I'll stop replying to retarded comments like these and I'll save myself a headache cya.
---
Man, chill out. Nobody is saying you have it easy, nobody is saying that the rest of us aren't very lucky to live where we do. We're only saying that if things are that rough, then playing WoW might not be your best option.
---
Is this set available One phase 1? All gathered by quests woot? Where can i get the first q?
---
You won’t have it anyway so whats the point? /s
---
I would do it the other way around. Level the hunter first, its easier. There is no dual talent, you will have a hard time with heal only spec or spend a ton to respec before every raid/dungeon.
---
Sounds like an excellent idea.
---
I played a Paladin in Vanilla becaus my Clan forced me to play Alliance. I liked the class and i found it powerfull enough even in PvP (played Ret of course).
---
After a while and 59668940304 AVs later i hated it to be in front line and beeing instant down so i leveled a Dwarf Hunter and a Undead Mage and really liked them.
---
I will start again as a Paladin because i just love the class and how they level and always beeing helpfull in dungeons. I aim for T2 and Rank 10 for my pala after i reached this goal i will either level a Hunter or a Mage.
---
It's free up to level 20. After that you need a subscription.
---
You don't have to min max anything, you can clear most stuff in just pre raid bis. 
---
That being said you don't need to gimp your self either. For me if a guild is giving nef head to casters over physical dps  it is a red flag and I would avoid it. I am saying this as a mage main. Of course some people would not mind it.

If you wait until the next Free Weekend then yes, but that's it.

"strategic suicides" ho vanila, you're so unique
---
Lol, ok please don’t post his name on Reddit. I was joking.
---
Orc is considered the master race for pvp and the probably best choice minmax pvp choice for each class available to it.....but if there’s one where it’s most arguable, it’s for shaman (..and maybe rogues?), with Tauren being an arguable alternative, so this is an amusing post.
---
Shaman actually has some pretty strong arguments for Tauren. Pvp wise, assuming you are ele/resto (enhance is not good pvp), the only racial from orc benefiting you is the stun resist, which is the most important one ofc. Tauren mostly gets war stomp. 5%hp is nice. Increased hitbox is a negative, but’s its not as bad as it is good for a warrior to be Tauren...when you make a Tauren warrior, you can more easily hit all other targets. For Tauren shaman, it only hurts you much vs melee, and it’s not that big a deal.
---
It’s worth noting shaman’s pvp trinket breaks stun, at least, as opposed to some classes that desperately need stun resist. And Free action potions can help in dire situations in pvp, so missing stun resist won’t matter for at least some % of the time if you use them.
---
And of course, you desperately need that stun, since you have none. War stomp&gt;Spellcast is an incredibly viable tool for shaman. It’s also a higher skill cap play, as opposed to 25% stun resist. If you are a bad player, I’d argue the stun resist is better. If you are really good, it’s at least more arguable. But it’s definitelry more fun, because it’s something you DO and actually set up and control, as opposed to rng cheating someone sometimes. When I pushed glad in wotlk, I was ecstatic I had war stomp and had not rolled some other race back in vanilla. I couldn’t imagine being without it. Although, by then, Tauren was more obviously superior imo, because the stun resist got nerfed starting in BC.
---
That’s another thing-if they make BC and you continue with your Tauren, the stun resist will be probably nerfed to 15%. Although blood fury gets buffed to affect spells at least? Minor points, ofc.
---
If you make a warlock or hunter, and care about minmax pvp, orc is the obvious choice, and you are slightly gimping yourself with something like undead or Tauren. It’s no contest. Here, it’s arguable either way, and you are getting a top tier race for your class either way, so if one seems more appealing to you visually, etc., go with that. 
---
Personally I think war stomp is more fun. I also like the way Tauren look. 
---
I am making a warlock and warrior in classic, and I am making both of them orc for pvp racials. But if I make a shaman someday, probably not before BC, I’ll be making it Tauren.
---
I remember 3 phases of gold farming in Vanilla on my server :
---
1 : hunters at the start of Vanilla
---
2 : rogues in the middle
---
3 : heavy mage groups doing dungeons at the end
---
I don't know how they do it now, but I guess they'll be in instances : better loot, no pvp, no mob sharing and nobody sees you so you don't get detected as fast
---
If you haven't read all of Tolkiens other work besides Hobbit and LOTR I recommend all of it. 
---
The Book of Lost Tales is AMAZING, there are 2 parts. Read both! That's some really really good fantasy.
---
Yes you can! But if I were you, I think trying to get a job for cash would be better than getting a job for a game. Then you can enjoy more things in life than just one video game! Not trying to be rude or harmful. I was in your boat at one point in my life. So do you obviously. and I hope all is well with you and your family. Much love from one gamer to another!
---
Looks like [Sparkmetal Coif](https://classicdb.ch/?item=1282) to me.
---
Grats on slaying Morbent Fel!
---
nope it is not but i would keep greens that have good stats and selling them when the second wave of chars come because those people will invest everything to have an alt up fast.
---
1.6 is phase 3, no reason for that to change.
---
how is priest leveling in vanilla?
---
What spec will you go? ranged dps, melee dps, tank, heal?
---
I played Warrior and a tiny bit of Mage towards the end of Vanilla but now I'm open to playing just about anything but Hunter and Shaman. Rogue, Mage and Warrior are all fun/powerful but overpopulated, plus I've already played Warrior. Paladins, Druids and Warlocks look fun but have their own downsides. Priest is currently my front runner but my mind will probably change more than once in the weeks/months to come.
---
To wolves and kodos indeed
---
Just bubble hearth smh
---
Depends what you want to do and how fast you level. If you hit max level in the 2 weeks i would level the Hunter so you can Farm some gold and devilsaur or so.
---
If you want to Raid you should level the Healer first and do MC as soon you see a group and are above lvl 55.
---
I was a resto Druid and resto shaman in vanilla, going to go feral Druid this time. I just want to world PvP with a bunch of Rogue/Druid friends and fuck shit up this time around. Doing stealth ironforge/stormwind runs with other druids and rogues were some of the best times I’ve ever had PvPing in WoW. 
---
Elemental Shaman was my favorite 1vX PvP toon ever, but the fun of stealthing and being such a useful utility in wPvP as a Druid just can’t be beat for me.
---
Yeah be wary of disenchanting anything that will fall into the twink brackets. People will be looking for once they start rolling alts.
---
You and half the server ... could be some great PVP though :o
---
It would have to be phase 3 since you need elementium, and that only comes from bwl.
---
Yeah, be wary of disenchanting anything that will fall into the twink brackets. People will be looking for em once they start rolling alts.
---
This is why I'm playing pally. Pvp and pve is pretty much the same spec
---
Im 28, what am i?
---
This is why i play 2H fury
---
Nice, thanks for the tip! The Adventures of Tom Bombadil is highest on my list, but I'll be sure to add The Book of Lost Tales. Not a lot of time to read with Classic coming up, though :)
---
And with a pocket pally you'd be unstoppable in both
---
I wish I'd though to check my WoW favorites playlist. You were seeking an all time great PvP video. That opening segment is inspired play.
---
Easy and steady but boring until you get shadowform. Max the wand talent and always get the best wand for your class. Shield, dot, wand and aslong you take the mobs one by one there is no downtime.
---
Wow you don't exactly elicit sympathy.
---
No sympathy for close minded people, sorry.
---
This sub is full of kids who played when they were 8. I don’t know how they did it. If I’d asked for a monthly game sub at 8 I’d have been punched in the face. Simpler times &lt;sigh&gt;
---
Orc -  if you plan on doing any hardcore PVP  
---
Troll - if you plan on doing any hardcore PVE  
---
Tauren - if you want an allrounder
---
Haha a-men to that!  There's plenty of good shaman gear out there too
---
Anyways palas need crit, fuck mp5 we got infinite mana!!
---
Used to play a human priest in classic with a mage alt. I want to play something chill with few responsibilities, so right now it looks like hunter or maybe warlock.
---
Very well said, 110% agree. Orc is a nobrain superior pick for literally every other class availabile, but shaman. Its tearing me apart :-(
---
pservers have literally all armor values wrong.
---
I finally settled on Undead Warrior after originally playing an Orc Warrior
---
Similar to yours. I want to finish all PvE content through AQ, get Benediction, and after any practical uses have 10+k gold and maxed double crafting professions. Maybe a twink or a modest BoE gear alt
---
Jesus Christ yes.

If you pick that book up you'll be done with it before this week ends. That's how great it is :D
---
Troll if you wanna hear cool jamaican jokes. Orc if you wanna hear "OUGHHH AEUHHGHH OUUGHH"
---
You too, Sir :)
---
Troll!
---
For real though just play what race looks best to you. Racials aren’t gamebreaking.
---
I was a human warlock I heard they were easier to play from friends. And I did enjoy it mostly. But with several years of mmo experience behind me I now know my favorite roll is healer. Which means my faction choice matters since there is a split between shaman and pallies. I eventually decided to stick with the alliance and am going pally for the "free" mount.
---
I’m gonna be an Undead Warrior, where before I was an Orc Warrior. Gonna have the same name and play the corpse of my old main.
---
I’ve played rogue for 15 years and the rules are pretty simple: 
---
1) if you don’t fuck with me, I will kill you when you’re low health
---
2) if you fuck with me, I will kill you when you’re low healthy, repeatedly.
---
The only exceptions to rule 1 are if I’ve had a really good day or you’ve gone out of your way to MC buff me. I’m not heartless, after all.
---
As a FC you want to spec resto for NS with  [http://classicdb.ch/?item=7721](http://classicdb.ch/?item=7721)  and  [http://classicdb.ch/?item=16768](http://classicdb.ch/?item=16768)
---
sounds to me like a pretty useless addon that has nearly no impact on anything oO
---
I see your point. My idea is to make additional money because with alchemy the money starts really getting in with higher profession level. In the beginning everyone is saving their money for the level 40 mounts, so the market would be really small for enchanting mats. Once we are half a year in classic I would start putting the mats on the ah. But in general is the a high risk of selling greens because of the fees you need to pay in ah.
---
I remember my father asking me why was i playing games where i kill crabs when I used to play shooters
---
I did play warlock on the original. We beat ~6 bosses in Naxxramas before TBC fever came and everyone sadly stopped raiding until launch.
---
I'm planning on going Warrior when classic launches and second char will be Druid.
---
There is just too much cool gear for Warriors, my dream is to get Kalimdors Revenger or Edge of Insanity.
---
As far as we know, phasing is taking it's back to classic, to make starting-zone experience smooth. It is not confirmed, yet can't say if it is QoL change or not. From a pure gamer perspective, it is fine, because nothing will ruin your start. From the perspective of a player, who started a lot of l2 servers (never touched p-wow servers but still), this first rush where the amount of players &gt; amount of mobs, that's what you like about new server vs old server
---
Is there anywhere i can check the "new" animations for races. Im going to play a human female and i would like to know how the new hit animations look. And compare them to the old models.
---
dear god, I'm actually cringing at that  thought
---
ok well even if it doesn't actually increase the percentage you attack faster so its 2x as many chances to proc overpower as with just 1 weapon, and if you go double daggers even more than a slow 1 hander
---
plus you'll get increased benefit from unbridled wrath
---
When you get good enough gear dagger will outperform sword in the end of MC and at the start of BWL. Then depending on what drops you get sword will outperform dagger later on AQ/NAXX
---
&gt;Sindrex#4881
---
Ah, I see! No worries, added you on discord :)
---
My main was an Undead Warlock. Played the life out of it, was relatively well known on the server, had a pvp reputation but mostly from really maximizing dmg output of Warlock in PVE, showing these Mages, Rogues and Warriors what a Warlock can do. ;)
---
Anyhow, it was a great ride, wonderful experience, made friends and enemies, was in great guilds and remember also well our Warlock community - overall these are the memories I want treasure when thinking about the original WOW (and BC) days.
---
and that's why I will try hard NOT to roll a Warlock again. It will never be the same. I don't want to spoil it.
---
It's time to roll something else.. either Hunter (a new challenge\^\^), Priest or Shaman. :)
---
Is there a similar thing for showing the new animations for different races?
---
Most rep values on Pservers (Nost and all that use their core) have around 50-100% increased rep from quests.
---
For disenchanting alt, you can just get a level 5 and place him in a city.  
---
As for herb /alch on warrior. You are loosing out on Engi. Unfortunatly is best in both pvp and pve for all speccs.
---
Rams only até phase3??
---
Any Italian guilds?
---
Still hurts druid viability in 5 mans due to not having a regular ress...
---
Well yeah. It gives more opportunities for the mob to dodge, but weaker Overpowers and Deep Wounds. I’d always use either sword-and-board for early levels and then 2h once you get a good one, or 2h all the way. But you do you, my guy.
---
Hey man - i ranked to R13 for the sole purpose of getting the 2 piece Set Bonus.
---
Up to AQ40 the PvP Gear and especially R13 with its 2 Set Bonus offers you wide possibilities.
---
Personally I have to say: As soon as AQ40 hits it's not needed anymore since you have for each slot "better" feral items statwise (no int/spirit or spelldmg like on the PvP). I kept R13 shoulders&amp;helm for the setbonus since I didn't have dropluck.
---
Short answer: it's not needed and gets replaced in a later stage of the game easily. If you have the time and enjoy PvP just go for it. Other classes profit more from their PvP Set - cause of the natural stat-spread for hybrids.
---
I upvote you. Because. You make sense
---
&gt; SC doesn't bother with anything outside the games.
---
AKSCHUALLY ... For SC2 they spun up quite a world building effort. The 6 novels covering sc and sc:bw repsectively aren't so bad. There are also some comics (never got them).
---
So "anything" is a bit strong. It's not at all as fleshed out as 40k. But it's not nothing either.
---
Yeah, this doesn't make any sense because PVP was already ridiculous with t3 content, with more and more stuff being added, you'd probably be able to one shot people from sw:p ticks from highest level 60 gear to lowest.
---
Ni hao :-)
---
Source? I've meticulously worked my rep plan from 1-44 on LB and I've verified the majority of the quests through Thottbot and Allakazam (cant find many of them, ofc) ausing the way back machine. The few times I encountered incorrect values, I reported them and they were fixed. 
---
It's not like quests are giving obscure rep numbers. It's still the correct 10, 25, 75, 150, 250, 350, 500, etc. You're not getting 1,000 rep for chain quests for example.
---
*laughs in PVE Realm*
---
Basically the same as any other player: know the mechanics and your class duty. Knowing when you need to tank and switch gear - same for DPS.
---
Feral DPS is probably the most difficult in vanilla due to it's rotation with Combo Points and power shifting.
---
So what does it take to make them work? Same as for any class/spec: a dedicated player willing to learn and improve.
---
Or a sociopath :o
---
Fury Warrior Orcs are insane dps though
---
priest can silence you
---
On pservers  the meta somehow has shifted. You see a lot more female orcs and  trolls. Probably because they have crazy strong group PvP racials as priest and most peolpe do not enjoy the hunchback males. And they have cute faces if you pick the right one.
---
What is weird about 4 and 5 being before 12?
---
Dwarf Priests FTW
---
Fame is both a curse and a blessing. They love flaunting their fame, so I have no sympaty when they get some ressitance.
---
Just like people love giving them stuff and helping, there will be people doing the opposite.
---
Entitled streamers who thing they can have fame without the negatives are hilarious.
---
Hurr durr worship me and give me stuff pls.
---
While I don't personally care to either worship or hate them, I will LUL when they get rekt, and pog when they do something cool or funny.
---
If you don't want to be ganked, play pve, have a delay or don't stream. You cant have it all.
---
Just like you cant go yell and dance in the street without some telling you to shut up or fuck off. Welcome to reality.
---
Dont forget shadowguard scaling 100% with +sp (afaik this was properly researched from back then) and it triggers blackout + their mini MS effect. Troll priests are a solid pick for both shadow and holy or disc.
---
So what’s the question for you here..the looks of orc you seem to prefer vs the fun of war stomp? Or are you just actually trying to get the very best minmax pvp potential, even when they are this close?
---
"Why are all our warriors proccing enrage?!"
---
Appreciate the offer! I'm still torn apart since I know that the Hybrid classes need the additional effort and I'm not sure if I have that time ressource.
---
Probably gonna casually level a Sham or WL - yet unsure for Feral
---
no you have it correct, time is relative. Time will pass slower for the person travelling closer to the speed of light (not the actual speed of light, say 99%) than the person who remains on earth. Same effect with gravity. The stronger the gravity, the slower time will pass.
---
Assuming 99% it is roughly 1 second = 7 earth seconds (long time since I did this so may be a little off)
---
3 months is about 788400 seconds / 8 = 985500/60 = 16425/60 = 273.75/24 = 11.5 days, or there about.
---
So about 11.5 days for 3 months to pass
---
if you increase the speed to 99.999% its something like 1 second = 20 earth hours.
---
(as I say I haven't done this since my university days, a long long time ago so I may be remembering this wrong :P )
---
Do you even play WoW ? Thandol span is above water, so you don't die if you're MCed down ... there's no repair bill. And it's actually large enough to be a pain to cover entirely for the guy who wants to troll. MC has a short range and 3 sec cast, it's not that easy to catch somebody. It's definitely not the same thing as going to Redridge and farming lowbies for 3 hours, damn, why do I even have to explain that.
---
Or you can just be a presumptuous ass acting like you see things in a deeper level when in reality he’s just asking an honest question
---
To avoid yourself giving a depression playing BfA at 110, just get a simple one day job. Thats way less effort
---
We found the orc rogue :D
---
You're Pathologist?
---
What u mean, the rogue is there he’s just stealthed.
---
Medal of Honor: Allied Assault  
---
Medal of Honor: Allied Assault Spearhead  
---
Medal of Honor: Allied Assault Breakthrough
---
No. You need a sub just to initially play to 110, and then you’ll have to keep farming gold on retail to continue to buy tokens. Honestly, I don’t think you’d have enough time to farm gold for a wow token to pay your sub *and* to play classic. It’s not really feasible. Especially considering the token will *only* be able to be purchased in retail, there will be no token market in Classic.
---
I’ve been poor. I’ve been borderline homeless. Honestly, if you can’t afford $3.74/week, you really should have better priorities. Gaming is a luxury. 
---
And Bulgaria isn’t exactly a third world country..... so let’s be less hyperbolic, and your attitude isn’t garnering you any sympathy.
---
But will they actually release and/or progress Items in every phase? I doubt
---
i will try out to play real shadow priest 0/3/48
---
What are PoE and GGG?
---
Used to play druid (loved both feral variants, despite being pushed to heal for ages due to guild matters), shaman (either offensive variant, spent some time as ele and some as enh as well, resto was not my cup of tea at all) and some pally (pure tbc shocka, disliked the warrior-ish theme that came with WotLK) on my retail TBC-WotLK experience. Have dabbled a bit with other classes in pservers. 
---
My current plan is unclear, but leans towards either warrior or hunter. Neither of the specs I enjoyed is in a reasonable spot (only feral is sort of decent, but it's the one class I'm absolutely unwilling to heal on...) so my odds go for tanking/pulling capability . My concerns are competition for either class (low number of spots for tanks and hunters) and PvP (warrior's poor solo and hunters' wonky itemization on weapons and the effect it may have).
---
Disenchant shit stats items, sell items with decent stats. You can use those gold to buy item with same level for less, profit right there.
---
Rofl, what a cunt
---
Was there any meme that died quicker than this virgin/chad shit
---
1.) Played on Anathema (now: Lightbringer)
---
2.) Yes, I beat Rogues - you can check my char (Ajana) combat logs on legacyplayers.com
---
Eventhough those logs were from a Guild where I suspect the Rogues to be mediocre (still full t2,5/partially t3 and beat them)
---
1. The ress in normal dungeon runs can  be a pretty big pain in the ass, especially in BRD or deep in to DM N/E/W when 1 person dies and no one can ress.
---
Then just get a shadow priest, Shaman or Paladin DPS (Or tank for the last one).
---
I dont know what I wanted to hear to be honest, just 3rd party opinion I guess in case Im missing something. Tauren is in my eyes better racial wise, but I keep struggle with how clumsy the model is, which always brings me back to thought about green-boys. Regarding the PvP there are other much more important factors than race in vanilla...Im just nerd who always tryies to squeeze the most from his decisions
---
Mouseover Renew was one of my favorite things back when I played priest in BC.
---
Really boring.
---
I grinded 52 to 60 in western plaguelands. 
---
I still remember my rotation (kinda).
---
Bubble, mind blast, SWP, wand wand wand wand wand till dead.
---
Levelling as a healer will be just as shitty on either type of realm
---
They look cool don't they. For me it's either male ud or orc fem.
---
It was from this reddit few weeks ago or something, someone from Nost was in an intervju on one of those Pods they spam. He confirmed they had no effin clue about rep gains and the rep gain functions/quests that got fixed usually had insane amounts compared to what they were supposed to have.
---
cba to find it but it'll be more of a grind in retail, that you can be sure of.
---
Human warrior, the animations, the mounts, the look and feel of ally citys
---
As said: 
---
Are Druids better Tanks than Warriors? No.
---
Are Druids better DPS than Rogues? No.
---
Versatility is the keyword. And in the end it's the player and not the spec that counts. I tanked better and did more DPS compared to other people playing "the proper class"
---
they did that?
---
Mained Hunter in vanilla. Thinking of going Mage this time around. Small chance I go pally tho if friends decide to go alliance.
---
There's no disenchant limit. A just-learnt enchanting can disenchant a max level item. 
---
Other than that, you'd better keep BoE good rolls (pre-40 mail/plate "of the bear", leather/post-40 mail "of the monkey" and so on) from disenchant and sell them.  The same goes for twink-favored BoEs. They are just more profitable than the certain mats you may get from them.
---
For the record, I love your idea.
---
If youre a dps with enrage proccing in raids youre either already dead or contemllating whether to lip or hope a tank taunts you off.
---
Dude graduated top of his class
---
Armour class that is

Thats the Karazhan bridge? i smell TBC

No classic for you.
---
Hey, I'm a 21 y/o with a fulltime job and no serious commitments. I'm looking for an EU Horde PvP server guild that wants to progress through PvE content at a semi-hardcore ish rate. Not looking for no-life raiding! I can raid usually 6-11 BST mon-fri so any date doesn't really matter. Could also raid on weekends. I'm planning on being a resto druid or priest, either way, a healer! 
---
Thanks.
---
Same, I started as rogue but switched to priest once I saw how cool their shadow form looked. I started healing to find groups quicker and once I realized how fun it was I never looked back.
---
Played Priest/RShaman from BC-MoP and never really played my rogue again.
---
I had almost the entire set on my alt rogue, but drakkisath never gave me that chest piece - so I couldn't do the last part. Regardless, 4 piece bonus was super strong (proc 35 energy on attack).
---
&gt;when prot warrior (don't ask me why) about 8-9 levels above
---
Because you're probably the highest lvl he can hope to kill in a reasonable amount of time :D
---
You don't even bind Shift+1..2..3..etc?
---
You might change your mind when you'll realize that you're still lvl 35 in STV while everybody is farming BWL :p
---

Hey Guys!
---
EU - ALLIANCE - HOLY-PALADIN
---
I'm looking for a nice raiding guild to level up and raid afterwards. Im an experienced (private) classic player. I've been my guilds class guide, cleared Ony, Mc, BWL and AQ40 with 3 classes and got to the horsemen in Naxx when I quit.
---
Obviously the guild should be fun and still driven. Also I gotta say, the leaders should be ready for input. (I won't flask for MC ;))
---
Hit me up boooiis!
---
Mained elemental shaman from TBC till BfA.
---
But I want to raid on a serieus level so had to pick something else. Now I'm a mage.
---
Aren't the new model datamined in the Classic files last week? If yes, maybe we will have a choice. Frankly it would be the best thing if we have the choice of playing with vanilla graphism/model or recent one.
---
Not sure if the hit box or item level would be the same tho, an if not, we will not have the choice.
---
In premades fury isn’t going to get much done. Warriors are brought for the ms debuff as much as their damage. If you just mean outgearing noobs and smashing pub bgs yeah any naxx geared pve specs will be fine.
---
I was Shaman back in vanilla. It's tempting to roll again since they are super useful in raids and decent healers.
---
I kinda wanna roll warrior and tank though.... But then again warlocks are also cool..... As you can see I am undecided...
---
Female tauren hunter
---
From their 2007 world tour?
---
The true fact of the matter with some hunter pets is, *we have to wait and see* Assume each pet will have their own attack speed dictated by their pet family.
---
The two hunter pets that I know of, Lupo and whatever the cat is with the highest attack speed, are both things that we'll need to either; wait for a beta to test, wait until classic launches to find out, or petition a Blizzard employee in the friends and family closed beta to disclose to us.
---
One point that is brought up in this video and elsewhere, is that not raising the level cap will mean that the pre-existing content will not become obsolete for those end-tier players. That's really not true. Once you are geared in the lastest tier of gear the previous tiers become obsolete as well. It really just is a problem with increasing the power level and not with raising the level cap. The only solution for new content without increasing the power level is gear that is the same power level of the last tier. However, if they do do that, then the problem will be that by the time that content comes around, all the players who have Naxx on farm will already be able to complete the new content with having to gear up much at all, and the challenge of gearing up while learning the mechanics of the new raid will be massively reduced. I don't have a solution myself but saying that keeping the level cap static isn't one either.
---
Hotel? Trivago
---
The demo was scuffed and a marketing trick to sell more blizzcon tickets. The devs have said that what was played at blizzcon didn't represent the build they actually had at the office.
---
There is no way pets will have normalized attack speeds.
---
Bear tank best tank
---
would have been better if you said you were a warrior
---
&gt; You are loosing out on Engi. Unfortunatly is best in both pvp and pve for all speccs.
---
Can still be worth as raw gold amount in the economy will be very low at the beginning and herb/alch helps you get to 60 more than engi. Respeccing to mining/engi at 60 might be the way to go.
---
Yea that would be awesome
---
Yes. I did this a year ago already.
---
Bought BFA and 1 month; got showered with gold because THERE IS NO CHALLENGE NOR FUN IN BFA and bought several months of game time ahead.
---
I'm going to get crucified with this but, I wish I could be a straight backed orc in Classic. I'm not saying they should make that change, but boy would I like that option. But I won't have it so I'll be playing strictly female orcs whenever I decide to make orc characters.
---
I don't exactly care what my character looks like because I know it will be a clown suit for majority of its existence, but I do care about each piece of gear's proportions and how it's actually draped on the models. The way hunched male orcs display gear just isn't for me. Though I'm 110% biased because my main if I end up going Horde will be an orc warlock and cloth gear on male orcs is a bigger train wreck than Brie Larson's acting career.
---
It’s fucking easy.
---
For sure minging/ engineering is best for warriors but i dont think i can make enough gold with engineering to buy the level 40 mount. Maybe with fishing / cooking it would be possible to accomplish that.
---
Leveled two rogues in vanilla. Gonna try a mage this time, easier lvlling and i probably wont raid too much anyway so might as well make the experience as ez and fun as I can while working full-time :)
---
Yes. It's very likely that new items introduced into the game will be added in the correct phase. We won't get item changes though so whatever form the item had at 1.12 will be how the item is when it is introduced.
---
You should play Alliance then. You're not worthy of being an undead
---
Thanks for your tip. I'll keep that in mind
---
Broken tooth, your ass is mine
---
Ahh, so they actually have bots farming dungeons? That's pretty impressive. I've only seen hunter bots.
---
I'm with the OP. Dying to play Classic....
---
Dwarf female rogue
---
I once grinded a hunter to 47, doing only the 3 class quests for the pet and the 1 fishing quest from Nat Pagle.
---
Skinning gave a nice income, world drops for gear and gold. A lot of crafting materials for the ah, like black pearls. I did an occasional dungeon run here and there, cooking and fishing along the way 
---
I like the calm grind in the wilds, prefered beasts in forrest zones. I RPed I was a lonely hunter with my best friend, my cat, only going to town for trading and resupply of ammo.
---
It took me around 6 weeks casually playing. Stopped for RL reasons.
---
Pft, there is no such thing as a female dwarf.
---
I raided as a shift worker in Vanilla. Basically as long as you are up front with your guildies about it you will be ok.
---
I would describe our raiding scedule as... serious-social raiding. 2 progress raids a week, 4-5 hours a raid. + Ony every week. It took a while to get the onyxia scale cloaks for a 40 man raid.  You prob wont see the end of Naxx. Everything else is doable though.
---
Yessir. I think there's only like maybe 5 dungeons from Vanilla that hasn't been revamped (tuning aside).
---
A good moonkin/ret will never do more damage than a weak warrior. Moonkins could in theory be utilized by letting them throw out some heals here and there and wait for a burst phase go ham. Because they have really nice burst. But then they are out of mana and useless. And I dont think I have ever seen someone utilizing moonkin that way.   
---
Ret doesnt even have good burst or anything... they are just bad. The only time you would ret over someone else is when you expect the alternative to fail mechanics miserably.
---
In all honesty now. Undead is the ultimate PvP class, and Im ally
---
Nope. I do the rest by clicking. Never had any complaints and would often get invited to dungeon/raid heal when I logged on. I'm just old and I'm use to doing myself.
---
man, druids are so underrated.  i think balance with good gear is really damn good in pvp, though i prefer that 1/29/28 build or whatever it was.
---
sure they cant raid dps, but apart from that they're excellent.  same with palas, although palas are weaker at duelling.  people think dps and duelling are the only things that exist for some reason
---
A massive thanks for providing us such a big wow movies base, you're awesome
---
Damn, I'm ally too.
---
I would love wowhead to have an filteroptiom to only show items obtainable in phase 1. Looking at preraid bis stuff and seeing I need a BoE world drop epic (2x) as ring I would like to see diffrent options available during phase 1.
---
Druids are needed anyway. They aren’t the best compared to one of these classes but are the best to be versatile. They are needed to push a battle rez when it’s needed. Their buff is also needed.

Been Elemental shaman main from TBC till BFA. Ive set my mind on mage for vanilla but every other class seems intresting to me. I used to onl like and love elemental shamans..

I just have to make 7 alts.

Take a look at Wayback machine and you could figure out a route.

well, tauren is more fun thats for sure. warstomp goes really well with many shaman spells, and can be used in a variety of scenarios and situations. also warstomp into iron grenade combo, is like 4 seconds aoe stunlock. you'll use it all the time, since both spells with low cd.
---
antistun won't really help you if couple of melees got on you, but as tauren you can warstomp, iron grenade, put earthbind, trinket slow if needed and get away, getting a ton of distance, kiting them.
---
more hp is super helpful in pvp. hp is one of the major stats for pvp. since shamans are face/hp tanking class (you rely on your hp to survive bursts). especially goes well with NS. you won't believe how many times you will survive at sub 5% hp, out of burst/silence/stun and pop ns and survive. as orc you'd be dead in this cases. vanilla is very bursty heavy, as most classes do their burst combo and then do much lower damage after. so you need to survive there combo, even if at very low hp and then you are usually fine.
---
again both are good choices. but tauren is more fun. so i pick tauren any time. good+more fun vs good+less fun.

Used to play undead warlock on retail. I branched out a bit on private servers to the point where pretty much the only classes I haven't played at max level are warrior and rogue.
---
Going to play a dwarf priest this time because I really enjoyed priest on privates, I really like dwarves for the look and animations, and they also happen to have really good racials.
---
Ya I get ya, I agonized over my decisions for months.
---
Looks seems like a big deal to me, so that makes me question things when I saw the deviate/noggenfogger. I wouldn’t want to worry about that all the time to cover up a race I don’t like, but I guess if you don’t mind it doesn’t matter.
---
Besides war stomp being more fun, the more I think about it, I do think I agree that it actually maybe slightly edges out orc. The only reason I hesitate is because I always see everyone saying orc is the best and I haven’t actually played private servers, so I haven’t actually had hands-on experience with the game for 9 years. And when I did play (vanilla-early Cata), I had lots of experience with a Tauren shaman, but I never played an orc at max level, so It’s hard for me to be confident in trying to compare.
---
But when I think about it, I’m struggling to see orc being superior. For bgs...Every 2 minutes with a Tauren, you get to decide a time that actually matters to use war stomp. If it’s 1v1, you are pretty much guaranteed a cast/some room, unless you make them waste trinket on a mini stun, which is also great for your team,and if it’s not 1v1, you might actually stun multiple people. A lot of the times you won’t be battling/will be in a GY/will be fighting but the individual skirmish will already be decided, so it won’t matter if war stomp cooldown is off. If you are in a fight that matters, stun resist only matters if someone is actually stunning you, and then it actually takes 4 stuns on average to get a stun resist. If you have more than 1 person on you, that resist might not even matter much, because you won’t be able to freecast anyway. And if you are facing someone that isn’t stunning you, ability to resist is useless, while you can even use war stomp offensively against a caster to interrupt them. You won’t always be close enough ofc, but sometimes you will.
---
In a 1v1 world pvp encounter where we are assuming you didn’t just pvp a minute ago, I’d argue having a guaranteed warstomp interrupt leading to a freecast or forcing trinket, is better than a possibility of resisting a stun. Stunning them can be what you need to start shock frost kiting, even. And you do have FAPs. And your trinket, so it might never even matter unless you get 2 stuns on you. So maybe for rogues that stun resist would be nice, but if you can trinket one of those stuns, getting a freecast off without fear of kick or honestly trinketting and warstomping to free yourself to frost shock kite or flame shock dot him/earthbind will be pretty powerful, even ghost wolf. Since your trinket gets rid of immobilizing and slowing effects as well, you can 2 for 1 a stun/crippling poison.
---
For dungeons and PvE solo, war stomp is obviously awesome.
---
For raids, it doesn’t really matter, but 5% hp isn’t nothing!
---
And frankly nature resist isn’t nothing either, for both raids and pvp.
---
Nature resist, and hp in raids, are obviously extremely minor considerations, but war stomp for soloing and dungeons will be noticeable. 
---
Just my thoughts, since you seem to really be torn. I still think differences are small enough, you should consider looks if that is important enough to you. But I don’t remover how practical is to deviate fish all the way...if that really wasn’t a concern at all, Tauren might edge out for me even from a minmax perspective, and war stomp is definitely more fun.
---
Im having a tough decision between undead priest or tauren druid. I dont care about numbers, best class at, blah blah blah. I just usually play plate wearing tanks and want to do something different. In my opinion these 2 classes are very flavorful and cant decide.
---
This time I will main a hunter.
---
It's the only class I haven't leveled to max in vanilla and tbc. 
---
I probably had too much time on my hands as a teenager...
---
No one's talking about dueling.
---
It was mostly solo. As a healer, it was very easy to group for dungeons/harder quests. 
---
At the end of the day, play what brings your joy!
---
First character was a hunter, made it to level 14. Then a mage to level 33. Finally a warlock that made it to 60 a week or so after TBC came out. Been playing since with a few breaks, mainly tanking since MoP so ill level a warrior in classic.
---
It's talking about CC. Nowhere in the comment did it specify PvE content
---
Was Rogue, going to roll druid.
---
I love healing, but I love the stealth aspect. Opens up so much possibilities of exploration and solo dungeon runs. 
---
It's a perfect combo. I'm also not worried about performance of the class. 
---
Played aion as a chanter and swtor as an I.A. I brought people to the bring of rage and disbelieve, because they couldn't kill me in pvp. 
---
I think druid is perfect for me.
---
Druid players being hyperdefensive makes the memes even better.
---
Grade-A meme.
---
Yeah I clicked my way through most of BC without any issues. Can't imagine going back though (especially with /focus macros for PvP) 
---
You'll be at a big disadvantage in PvP though.
---
Also having bindable buttons on the side of your mouse is game changing.
---
Not doing that. If you don't want to play priest, then don't play the class.
---
There are 3 other choices you can consider.
---
The technology wasn't there.
---
I also took all my screenshots with a flip phone...
---
You literally cannot complete the quest without going to BWL.

&gt;Hunters now have a UI option Auto Attack/Auto Shot that if turned off means that the hunter will not automatically switch between ranged attack and melee attack difficulty when the range changes.
---
Thats patch 2.1. So before it did switch automatically.
---
But its been a long time, I'm probably wrong.
---
Those incel memes are pathetic
---
Warriors dont need to respec. There are some excellent hybrid specs that enables you to do dps, tank and pvp just fine. Unless you want to do heavy progress raiding or aim at r14, the difference is not significant.
---
I remember it used to be a hell hole trying to turn a quest in there, waiting for the npc to respawn only to die again and watch them kill the respawn.
---
I always played Shaman - and always resto with a dream of playing enhance.   
---
I got to the point where I actually really enjoy healing, but have gotten kinda tired of spamming chain heal.
---
So that leaves priest and druid as the options (I ain't no alliance scum)
---
Priest was actually what I first thought, - it's the "real" Vanilla healer, plenty of different healing spells, etc etc. 
---
However, class fantasy kinda matters to me, and I like the idea of the nature hippie kind of class (that's why I originally went shammy, based on WC3) - so druid just speaks more to me. 
---
What I'm really looking forward to is the fun leveling experience, you run faster, you don't need breaks for mana or healing (if you play efficiently) - you can tank, heal, or dps dungeons, - you can get out of any PVP situation (or just bore people to death by self-healing and going in bear form). 
---
I'm also looking forward to playing a class that is needed in the raid, and benefits the healing roster, but isn't about healing metres. I'm not gonna top anyone as a druid, but I might be the one making sure dps is kept alive when everybody has to move, by throwing around rejuv - while making tank healing easier with a rejuv and a regrowth - and the one that just has mana forever with that efficient, but kinda slow, healing touch. Also battle ress and innovate for karma points all day long. Oh and the fact that my tier pieces will only be shared between myself and 1-2 other druids (likely) definitely helps too. 
---
What I'm not looking forward to is not having a ress for instances, and having to carry around 3+ gear sets for different situations. And then I might get kinda sad with not really seeing any big crits, but just slowly chipping away people's HP while outlasting them.
---
How much time did it take to farm crowdpummelers to prepare for every raid?
---
Man it's gonna be fun being part of the great Broken Tooth hunt with all the other hunters that rush to 37..
---
Don’t like that hunch?
---
Honestly herb/alch is super bad combo on a warrior, engi is way too good for tanking and dps, but yeah you can disenchant any item with lvl 1 enchanting
---
Agreed this isn’t like current wow where you can cap a new character in a week. You better pick the one you find most appealing right off the bat and you’ll be fine
---
For ally pvp the best is gnome and dwarf. Maybe elf if you go Hunter for ambushes. Gnome is very good to escape slows and snares. Dwarfs laugh at rogues poisons and bleeds
---
Depending on the raid. I didn't use Pummlers ALL THE time - way too much effort for each boss.
---
Mainly used them on stationary Bosses with not much mechanics (Patchwerk/Vael/Magmadar and so on)
---
On Average: 1 for MC / 2-3 for BWL / 3-4 for Naxx / maybe 1 for AQ40 since you OT a lot there
---
But in the end it comes down to you and how much effort you want to put in. You make around 2.5 Pummlers in 20 Minute of runtime with another 40 minute downtime. 
---
(sidenote: killing Robots on the way out for the Fused Wirings - they are very expensive)
---
this is what this sub needs to be

Ganklethorn Vale

Benediction is such a cool looking weapon. Im having a hard time choosing between priest or paladin because of this. Haha
---
0,0069% of the time, it works every time!

Kite or die. As a 19 hunter twink from vanilla, I just have to say how amazing hunters really were. In WSG you would just dominate everything, especially in 1v1 and in duels I never lost against another 19 twink, and my most fond duel memories are beating a 30~ mages and a 30~ priests and even up to a 52 warrior. 
---
Most people play rogues from my experience, and then it was probably warriors and then pallies (I was horde). When I made my hunter I was the only hunter on my entire server, and google didn’t even have any guides or anything for hunters, so naturally, teenage me had soso-bis gear. But despite that, nobody was ever a threat at any time. As someone else mentioned earlier rogues usually skip using stealth all together since they basically are gimped warriors - they either are using a Shadowfang and just want to melee you with sinister strike or are using Assassin’s Blade and want to run behind you for backstab. Either way, they will never ever reach you, ever. Warriors and Paladins are also easily kiteable. 
---
I used a boar because I loved how it looked (a black one of course) and sounded, it was a total dumpster vacuum for all kinds of foods and of course mainly because of the charge, which would turn any bad fight into an easy win just by clicking one button.
---
I did some world pvp with the hunter, in Ashenvale and STV and it was pretty good, but getting slaughtered by random monsters wasn’t worthwhile. Worked like a charm in group pvp though.
---
Running to each portal was such a horrible idea that they scrapped it within a few months. Battle masters will likely launch alongside BGs in classic.
---
They changed this in Legion, didn't they? You have the same armor type from the start these days.

Kite or die. &lt;3
---
Just because it's in the demo isn't really an indication of it being in classic. The demo was scuffed and there's plenty of things they forgot to "roll back". So any left overs like normalized atkspeed is probably just something they forgot.
---
Night elf all the way.
---
Its not so much about warriors not being good at dps, but rather every other class sucking as tanks.
---
rofl i love chad vs virgin memes.  20 scarlet thots rush to sex him back to recovery hahaha

Playing in vanilla when no one did it compares to the dozens I see on pserver.
---
we ganked alliance on the tram for the very same reason, all through a bunch of expansions.
---
1. Ok damnit i thought i knew you
---
2. Yeah like that's insane. I'm going to roll for a Feral Druid in vanilla too as my Main, my twink is going to be a Prot pally, 2 specs that not many people will expect to be good. Looking forward to get DFT already on my Feral and be above the rogues in the DMG Meter.
---
Mate, youre on r/classicwow

It will be a customized retail API. Blizz has to restrict and remove certain functions (group finder, communities, collections etc) while adding old ones (e.g. spell ranks, honor system)
---
Oh damn I'm was on popular instead of home. Disregard that comment!
---
I really wished they implemented proximity voice chat in WoW, you can just imagine people’s visceral screams of horror fade away as you push/MC them off cliffs
---
I main a Resto Shaman and a hunter.
---
also, make sure you /spit on the corpse, not on the ground.
---
There was a macro that automatically switched between herb/mine tracking every gcd. Not optimal, but enough for most scenarios
---
I’d totally be down for something like this. Can you imagine barrens chat in the cross roads? It’d be a fucking mad house.
---
But all in all, I think it’d be a lot of fun. Doesn’t change game play, and encourages players to still actually talk to one another.
---
I suppose its because sap only works on humanoid and blind on certain mobs.
---
That screenshot is from modern wow
---
It used to happen somewhat regularly, but it would more often than not be 3 people jumping a flagged person when they were killing a mob. A lot of people in actual vanilla who started on a PvE realm did so because that was the suggested realm to them when they first logged in. So you got a lot of people who ended up liking PvP 'stuck' on PvE servers. On one of two servers I played on (which was a PvE server), some of the top players would have duel series and set up fights in gurubashi etc and a few of them went on to be glad/R1 players. In 2k19, I think there will be a lot less people who want to PvP ever on PvE realms. You will never get the same real horde vs alliance feel when the vast majority of the opposite faction you pass by are not flagged and will not attack you.
---
Not much different than on a PvP server then. On PvP servers you also mostly get attacked by more than 1 while being engaged with a mob. Opportunity is king on all server types. 
---
Don't forget that 95% of all world PvP is a gank.
---
Your booty is my looty.
---
You aren't wrong about that but with peels priests are way better healers. Druids have hots which are instantly purged or dispelled,can only cleanse poisons, and healing touch has a longer cast time.
---
Priests have way more utility but fuck druids are just too fun. 
---
I have raided vanilla as a druid, paladin, priest. The most fun I have had was with a druid.
---
That is actually soooo true!
---
I never kill any priests especially lowbie priests - they are quite annoying to kill - they can´t defend themselves - they are cute - they can´t defend themselves and they ofc can´t defend themselves.
---
Though I have to say - I skip shadow priests too because I usually get rekt by them xD (when I´m even Level with them - if they are lowbies I usually just skip every1..)
---
If you go BiS at 60 some items could be off your armor type anyway.
---
No, it won't.
---
Nope xD
---
During all the time what i played in WoW - only destrolock. But this mage rly nice)
---
Incorrect. Private server reuptation is inflated.
---
I have this song as my alarm, and you just gave me chills lol. Such a beautifully written piece of art.
---
got the entire tier 0, two pieces of the 0.5 and proceeded to to get tier 2 and 3 etc.
---
That's my problem too. Paladins are so good at PvP healing but that staff and that tier 1 priest gear is just so nice.
---
Played during Vanilla.
---
Undead character, exalted with TB, Org and revered with Trolls.
---
Eastern Plaguelands, believe it or not
---
Fair. I forget Blizz puts out a fair amount of novels.
---
Of course things can be patched. The question is, will they?
---
Had an orc warrior in vanilla. So I'll be doing the same except this time I'll actually reach 60 and tank for my guild.
---
Once again, blood fury works better here too because the dps warriors, unless they're off tanking, shouldn't be taking much damage.
---
well feral druid is already viable as a tank and DPS only thing is they require much more work than a prot war or rogue and they have certain encounters they just aren't capable of tanking. Balance is already terrifying in pvp by the time nax gear rolls around, and survival is also a meta spec at a certain agility level
---
the rest of them are more than likely not gonna move up in the "meta"
---
Yeah and then you come across the guy just playing death metal as loud as possible and is blowing out the mic. Then it’s a scramble to mute him ASAP before your ears bleed.
---
Also I imagine rogues being hilarious. Not being able to see them, but hear them. I could imagine myself sneaking up on someone and then sneezing right before I attack and they freak out and start spamming aoe.
---
Yep, still going to miss the OG experience, but I'm also excited to play a Healer from the "beginning".
---
If I feel like it, I can twink a Rogue later on.
---
there will be thousand of "Casuals" or "normal" people playing just for fun. People that are subbed here or play on Pservers are the totally Hardcore fans. 
---
So i would not worry that much but keep in mind that you will not be in the top 10 Raiding Guilds with a Ret Pala ;)
---
It's not possible, if you ask anyone who played during actual Vanilla.
---
Anyone using private servers as a reference is fooling themselves lol.
---
Not really. Just replace them as you go with good plate over time. In reality the big deal for melee classes while leveling is 90% the weapon.
---
if your going premade most of them don't want a spriest anyway
---
That just made me realize how much trolling potential Rogues would gain. Just stealthing around and talking to people that can't see them - but not killing them.
---
Safe to assume they won't. Good luck with BT.
---
I really enjoy feral but it's so freaking time consuming if you wanna do it "right"
---
Yeah man rock it and go for it - have a great time :)
---
Well the term "meta" means something along the lines of the most effective trend, right?
---
So unless they get buffs, the meta wouldn't change. 
---
In regards to those specific examples you brought up, feral tanks are good for dungeons, and balance druids and retribution paladins likely won't slow you down too badly in dungeons either.
---
If I recall correctly, the survival talent tree is used for a certain stage of raiding, when the hunter doesn't or does have enough agility.
---
Tried that. Got ganked by same after.
---
Yeah but feral druids eat rogues
---
I’m also gonna roll shaman. I think he’s referring to how the D1/D2 sets have a little bit of every stat on it, great for running around in hybrid spec. T2/T2.5 are pretty decent for the 20/0/31 spec and T3 is just healing for the most part. The hardest part of enhancement IMO is stat priority because you literally need every stat so it’s a true hybrid class in that sense. Jack of all trades
---
Troll hunter is good because of their beserking thing. Ranged weapon skill means shockingly little.
---
And eventually you'll be xbows as a hunter no matter what so that troll bonus only really does a lot before BWL is on farm.
---
Mind Blst is horribly mana inefficient. You could have replaced it with 2-3 Mind Flays.
---
The only you can only do once per fight and if it breaks ur fucked? Naw sheep is better
---
I wouldn’t get carried away with that priest talk. Routinely dunked high end raiding priests as a raiding Druid in vanilla. Regrowth spam and horsing your inner ages will take you places
---
&gt; You also have the best epic questline in the entire game, hands down.
---
Which one, which one? :O
---
I remember preparing my body for a multi-day farm to get to tame broken tooth. Instead I spotted him on my first lap and tamed him without being contested vOv

5mans are where you'll shine, as well as in wsg, so make the most of that!
---
I lol'd picturing this in napoleons voice
---
Gnome Rogue. They have the +5 to salt levels when killing an enemy player racial that's really nice.
---
Till it comes to 1v1 than rogues are budget classes compared to druid xD
---
I was a Warlock in classic, but I've fallen in love with Mage on private servers so I'm going mage.
---
People who are still subbed to BFA have no self respect nor dignity.
---
Close, but I said “intentionality” (looks similar)!
---
What I was discussing is the philosophy behind the term “intentionality” 
---
Google defines this as “the quality of mental states (e.g., thoughts, beliefs, desires, hopes) that consists in their being directed toward some object or state of affairs.” 
---
Which I guess is close enough - gotta just take it a few steps further, which is where I was trying to head. It’s not about the “deliberate” or “on purpose” it’s about things that are seemingly “deliberate” or “on purpose” but either categorized or claimed to be an accident.
---
This is where people struggle to understand law and the application of “intent” when determining criminal behavior. It’s an amazing study, to be sure! I highly recommend it for everyone, and many people come away with strikingly different perspectives that always intrigue me!

Aha. A true hipster of the classic wow community. \*Tips fedora\*
---
I think in classic, you'll see about 4 different type of players.
---
1.  Min maxxers, trying to get server first. 
---
2.  Dedicated raiders, but not 100% about efficiency.
---
3.  Super casual, been there done that pug groups.
---
4.  Casual noob types.
---
Any class, race, spec will work for groups 2-4.   So you'll have people.
---
The "meme specs" are all bad because they aren't complete, they lack design. No magical unintended change is suddenly just gonna make them good.
---
Haha soooooo many times
---
It entirely depends on the piece/class you are playing and the amount of physical DR gained and in general it really doesn't matter too much (as weapon dps/speed is going to be the biggest factor), so don't stress about it. For example, a warrior isn't going to drop Herod's Shoulder for a white or bad green plate piece but you would drop a level 26 leather shoulder for slightly sub-par plate.
---
I’m actually a casual player so I don’t care if my pet has 1.0 or 1.2 or even 1.3 AS. I’ll probably just get some cool looking cat with 1.3 AS very early on and stick with him forever.

The only “honorable” rogues I ever met back in the day were those protecting low level/low geared players, or camping campers. Honorable WPvP back in the day meant if someone ganked you, you ganked them back (if you could), and that was that. You didn’t camp them, you simply repaid the favor. If you tried and failed, you left them alone, and they left you alone. If they kept it going, you could do the same. But once it was done, it was over and you moved on. Rogues, on the other hand, will hunt down anyone mercilessly for no reason, other than “they can” - and THAT is why you make their life as hard as possible any time you get the chance. And hey, if I gank you while you’re in world combat and you die, then you spend the next 4 hours hunting me and killing me, then my sacrifice to the world (of Warcraft) is that I have kept you from success in other areas, meaning others may be safer a little longer, and you will have to wait to finish that quest/farming and hopefully you will have wasted your time engaging me to the point you have lost all honor and self respect.
---
...it’s a small victory, but I’ll take it. See ya in Classic! /wave
---
That makes your class choice easier then lol
---
Sure there are, they’re just really good at being rogues.
---
Actual vanilla cooldowns on worldbuffs will make them less viable. That said, a ret paladin and a feral druid in your raid will not stop you from clearing Naxx and an extremely tryhard ret paladin or feral with MCPs will bring themselves on par with or above less serious meta spec players.
---
...me and a few rogues too, by the looks of things!
---
Yea and Dwarf racial is totally weak right? Esp against other rogues...Man they should start teaching kids at school about the longtime effects of tunnel vision.
---
Keep your battle royales over where they belong, in the pee corner
---
Only way is if they substantially changed the game.  Either available gear would have to drastically change, or talent trees.  Likely both.
---
META is ‘most effescient tactic’ afaik
---
Proximity voice chat existed way before Battle Royale games were even an idea. Just saying.
---
I mean, I consider telling other people what they should think is fun, to be crying.
---
But that’s just me.
---
Funny, I'm a similar story. Pally heals in vanilla and bc, pally tank wrath to mop, monk tank mop onwards.
---
I'm done babysitting. I just want to dps
---
bro just use your brain
---
I wonder if it’s worth buying stuff early, and try and sell it later on
---
Big items are probably, but what about ores and herbs that will increase in price
---
Wipes whole raid then proceeds to Feign Death.
---
Do I even want to know what RBG is

I’m going Tailoring/Enchanting so I’ll probably be one of those guys buying your mars.

Well for balance druids 6% hit via talents would be enough and of they want then to be good give them more mp5
---
As for priest, I'm not as familiar, but I don't think there's much to be done except keep SW:Pain on them at all times. 
---
As for mage, you have plenty options. Open up with fireball instead of frostbolt once you have them sheeped, follow up with R1 Frostbolt. In case they vanish after the DoT expires, keep rank 1 Arcane Explosion and Rank 1 Blizzard ready. Vanilla Rogue Mage is my second favourite PvP matchup of all games of all times, you're gonna have loads of fun.
---
Staysafetv has a video on it on YouTube, just watch that. It explains how and has links to the quests you need to do.
---
classic wow will be patch 1.12 which is far past 1.3
---
Right but you still can't complete without bwl.
---
Just drove an automatic for the first time. Which moron decided reverse should be forwards and drive should be back?
---
Oh for sure, but few and far between
---
the ravenholdt q around i dont know, 30 or so? is one of the most useless time sinks.
---
Authenticity.
---
Why did MOP got the worst reaction, and WOD just a simple meh?
---
If I roll a fresh toon for Vanilla its probably priest as they apparently had a brilliant lvl 60 class quest for an epic staff or something. Going to miss my \[hide of the wild\] cloak pattern I got on my original leatherworker tho. aka the only healer cloak worth wearing in all of vanilla.
---
Switch MoP and WoD and it’s pretty accurate for the playerbase i think :p
---
Priest should heal, Druid should tank. Rest dps. Priest dps is too mana intensive (the actual dps is fine), which would slow the group. 
---
On fights where mind controls can be used, someone else should heal.
---
Really good for world PvP and duelling. Which for me is the most fun PvP, although least rewarding unfortunately as all you need is a shitton of honor. 
---
It's still fun to run flags in WSG and supporting a rogue trying to cap a base or tower.
---
I played a hunter, nelf male even, cleared most of BWL before making a guild with friends for the rest of vanilla before ultimately rerolling Rogue when TBC came out. 
---
For the most part I hated it, and have avoided it since then, playing rogue, mage and druid on pservers. 
---
Ironically I feel like I missed out as I had no idea what the fuck I was doing back then, and for that reason I'm considering going hunter again.
---
no
---
I bet that female tauren shaman is even more rare.
---
In the same way PvP servers is just mass rape then? Being raped 1-60 until you become the rapist himself? What a silly comparison.
---
I've tried this before. Your math is more or less correct.
---
It comes down to about 10k rep you're missing. 
---
You can get this rep with cloth turn ins, and I believe there's also 2 repeatable quests in Un'Goro that give you the rep. One is the turn in of a hyppogryph egg. Forgot the other one.
---
I never bothered with the cloth turn ins or those quests tho, so my undead remains raptor-less. I might do it on Classic though if the circumstances are right.
---
Switch my mind from time to time but in the end I came up wit Warlock or Shaman from warlock/shaman/rogue/mage/priest.
---
I think for now It's more leaning towards Warlock but then I got the new struggle...Undead or Orc?...  
---
Orc pretty much if I want to pvp but undead isn't too bad there either but when it comes to Rogues and 25% stun resist... well yeah...
---
Not much of a fan when it comes to orc and spellcaster when I'm such a huge fan of Drakedog, Sylvictus, Seuche, Necrolic and Goth where Seuche is the one who prob swing around with different classes. So Prob will go Orc but it's gonna hurt some in me :p
---
You have no peel and are the worst PvP healer in raid spec.
---
80% of your job is wf and chain heal.
---
Your armour is shitly itemised and looks gash.
---
the av ram, yes
---
well maybe us , as a community can try to help it. when we have server list we can make a sticky thread with a poll : "what server do you want to play on ?" , and repeat this poll every weeks before release until it balance itself a bit
---
Well, was good popcorn!
---
That'd be hilarious, AS LONG AS the proximity chat turns the other factions words into jibberish.
---
Main stats always better. But it all depends on how big the upgrade/drawback is. You would still get certain quest rewards and wear leather or mail as a warrior, for example, if it has very good stats.
---
Man this is a frustrating post to comment...On the one hand you're clearly making an effort to get your point across to which I usually reply as level minded as possible. But on the other hand your post is so condescending while being so fundamentally wrong and incoherent on some aspects that I can't help myself but react with sarcasm and condescension myself. So excuse me if my reply is gonna be passive agressive, I'll try to keep it as neutral as possible in case you're actually looking for a discussion.
---
But anyway, here we go.
---
&gt; That was basically true in TBC when contrasted with vanilla
---
You didn't put it into any context though, it was just a blank statement and that statement remains wrong. And even in contrast to vanilla it's still kind of wrong, because the advantages of freecasting in the context of a tbc fight is still pretty much as big as it was in vanilla. Arguably even more so in tbc since both CoC and Fireblast dealt more damage compared to frostbolt in vanilla than in tbc which made using them in a burst scenario more more useful in vanilla than in tbc. A little convoluted, but I think you should get my point.
---
&gt; I said many times they basically became part of a rotation of spells rather than being the meat and potatos of your arsenal
---
Frostbolt still was the meat and potatoes though. The only thing that changed was icelance (which is pretty situational and only made sense using against a frozen target and even then frostbolt STILL dealt more dmg) and water elemental, which was passive damage and an extra nova. What these things did do, was allow you to be more mobile while still dealing some damage.
---
&gt; icelance was critting harder than frostbolt
---
Like I said, Frostbolt was still the hardest hitting frostmage spell in tbc.
---
&gt; I never said frostbolts did no damage, you're strawmanning me
---
No I'm not. You literally said Icelance held other spells hostage, which is flat out wrong. Then after being called out on it you start dialing back and suddenly begin talking about a "rotation" which is a far cry from your initial statement. Hyperbole or not. 
---
&gt;  If mages had "frost form" as their last talent, icelance had a cooldown, and all their other spells did 40% more damage it would not have been a problem
---
So you're suggesting to buff one of the strongest tbc classes by pretty much 40%? That's laughable. Also just to get things straight, you complain about frostbolt being a "filler spell" in tbc compared to vanilla and is only part of a rotation (which it also was in vanilla btw, you used CoC and FB basically on cd) and your solution is to buff ALL mage damage? Where is the logic in that?
---
Again you are not complaining about the mage, but about the fact that tbc is less bursty than vanilla was, which has absolutely nothing to do with the class but for the most part with resilience.
---
&gt;  I didn't mean every single last word 100% literally. that is completely normal
---
It is, but certainly not in the way you did, because you didn't use them to accentuate anything but just randomly spill them into your posts. You don't make it clear when you mean something literally and when it's exaggerated. It becomes especially unclear when your post contains flat out wrong claims, is contradicting itself and seemingly can't differentiate between class changes and expansion changes. 
---
To this point I still don't know if you're fine with tbc and actually think the mage specifically got shafted in tbc or if you dislike tbc as a whole and badly used the mage as an example. 
---
&gt; I have a feeling you might be more comfortable in the retail wow forums dude
---
That's actually more funny now that I've read your post for a second time. Speaking of that, I have a feeling that a lot of the things you write down seem completely obvious to you, because you know your exact train of thought that went into writing it. So naturally you're looking at that compressed thought of yours with this knowledge in mind, but don't realize that there's fundamental information missing for someone to correctly interpret it, who can't look into your head. I don't know...just something that may help you communicate with strangers.
---
Enh pvp relies on getting good drops from end game raiding. You wont be getting those drops before warriors and rogues.
---
Windfury white procs were bugged, and fixed in 1.12 so none of this crazy global 1- shotting.
---
But shamans are great purgers.
---
I listed them in order, starting with the expansions that caused my downhill trend of boredom. BC and WotLK were fun.
---
they are the Horde ;)
---
My first character ever was a Human Rogue named Landroy - He would only get to 45 before BC released as I was only like 10-12 years old or so. I think for Classic I'm gonna roll something else, though. For one, Rogue are going to be a dime a dozen if P-servers have taught me anything, and, number 2, I'm not a big fan of DPS roles and prefer healing and tanking.
---
I will probably roll Priest or Warrior, but maybe I'll play Paladin and do both Sub-optimally as I'm not going to be a hardcore player by any means.
---
Or favor for alliance with instand BG queues.
---
dont forget BiS feet and /lol
---
I don’t get the hate on MoP. It had beautiful zones, none of that endless green grim shit, and lots of content. Great expansion.
---
Orc Warlock. Orc anything really.
---
Not many bows that are any good lategame unfortunately
---
Better tell what the other classes that you consider to roll.
---
never thought about it, but i dont know why it should not be possible.
---
Priest healing is really fun to play in a premade where you have a bulky warrior to intercept all the rogues who dare go near you. In pugs it's the literal worst and you may as well just buff, put renew on everyone and then die to a rogue that nobody notices. 
---
Druids are the other way around. In premades they are not as powerful as priests so they are usually taken for flag running or stealth supporters. In pugs though, oh man it's intense to both try and heal your team and get rid of the rogues.
---
Nope, i just know from experience its about 15g an hour grinding on warrior
---
I forgot to mention there's a vendor in the north west corner (not misty valley) in a little neutral camp, you don't always have to run to Stonar/Nethergarde Keep to vendor
---
I think there are people who enjoy chaos and real danger - and they roll PvP servers.
---
And others enjoy safe space and rainbows. They roll PvE.
---
I am glad Blizzard will make spaces for both.
---
I played in vanilla, but I, like many people didn't have the information we have now to plan routes to maximize rep. People skipped/missed quests, leveled in other areas with their friends, out leveled quests, etc.  
---
And I dont get all the PServer hate lol. Thottbot and similar sites listed the rep rewards just like sites do today. You can still see how much the quests gave back then using the way back machine, screenshots, old videos etc. Are some quests off? Definitely. But if you think it's going to be vastly different, you're undercrediting PServer developers and players. 
---
I'll remember this convo and I'll eat my words if I can't make it to Exalted with Darnassus before 45 -- but I think I can. :]
---
Asking the real questions
---
I had Disturbed on my Winamp playlist running 24/7 when i played vanilla. So many good albums.
---
My favorite was Indestructible :)
---
Honestly I’m just not a smart person, this happens all the time I’m used to it by now.
---
I really need a WoW classic trailer set to Momma, I'm Coming Home by Ozzy.
---
You’re absolutely right about the quality of the game but the story telling was lazy and vilified the Horde by turning Orgrimmar into the final raid. I think much of the hatred from the game comes from Horde players not wanting to be labeled as bad guys for the sake of moving the plot forward. BfA seems to be repeating that.
---
[ftfy](https://i.imgur.com/RnOoEvD.png) although I wouldn't consider vanilla a "little" better, much better. Wouldn't call any version of wow "perfect".
---
Damn dude, been looking for something like this.
---
Thanks a lot!
---
No, play what you want, and put more effort into your posts.
---
IIRC the hunter D2 wasn't very good.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJX4ytfqw6k
---
I hope so
---
shamans are great.
---
only downside is that being a totem bitch not really inspiring for an alpha mentality person, and feels super beta tbh. follow that guy and keep droping redroping totem all the time, whereever he moves to.
---
Same here. Just want something different though. Warrior is a bit stale after playing it for 1000s of hours.
---
a team of Fire mages with rollig ignite in AQ40/Naxx wont be beaten by anyone.
---
You’re probably right. Vanilla was full of flaws but it was my first love.
---
Their damage will be normalized, not the attack speed
---
Reading comment threads on Reddit is like screening trade chat - hilarious when good
---
Im not saying Horde Ferals are bad. But Horde Ferals are objectively worse than Alliance Ferals when compared side by side.
---
A lot of people got triggered over the kung fu panda aspect of it. I think that's reasonable MoP had a retarded as fuck theme, but gameplay wise WoD was such a pos compared to MoP. I would consider modern semi tolerable if the over all gameplay was like MoP, but ever since WoD they have continued that general direction.
---
Rhok'delar.

I hope so. They are nice for breaking Sap when guardian flags and towers.

To follow up on yesterday’s excellent discussion (https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bfxsej/any_tips_getting_exalted_with_darnassus_by_40_as/), if there is in fact a cap on spillover rep (halfway through honored, revered or whatever it turns out to be) it will behoove you to stop completing Darnassus quests about 1-2,000 rep away from the cap. Then, go work on a bunch of quests from the other factions to get that final push of spillover rep up to the cap before switching back and resuming Darnassus quests (assuming you dont overlevel them into gray). That way, you maximize the effect of spillover rep before it expires and save valuable Darnassus quests for that final push to exalted.
---
Funny, I thought the song was: "You will never be a rogue, always healing and crying about your class!"
---
That's only because every mages ignite gets put into 1 and that 1 person gets the DPS. Not quite fair the say mages are the best dps when it takes several of them to make 1 of them the top.
---

I don't think you could ever be killed from it. It ticked for 12ish damage per tick and most classes regenerate more than that out of combat.

- Leveling sucks

- Your raid spec sucks in PvP
---
- Your viable PvP spec needs gear from raiding
---
- Neither the PvP nor the PvE spec is really good for farming
---
- Respec costs add up quickly
---
Some people dont want toggleable modern animations because with the new animations spells are more "recognizable" and thus giving an advantage in PvP.
---
Its not that people downvote everything without a reason, some reasons are just to far fetched.
---
Personally I rather don't have the new models+animations because I want everyone to see and play the same thing.
---
I dont see why people want updated models and animations. Are the old versions to "clunky"?

Is that behind the mountains? Near that single farm?

This was good

Why? Shammy is fkin awesome to play! I played as a hunter main, and raided hardcore with a good raid guild back in Vanilla, and PVP'd also to Marshal. Loved it. But the most fun I had was on a resto shammy alt. I got him into BWL, and pvp'd the BGs with him. Loved being a shammy healer in BGs, and healing in AV or Arathi B.  
---
I didnt play arenas on him, but loved playing open world PVP.  I was T1 &amp; some T2 as well as pvp gear. I always found I was pretty damn hard to kill, and could survive till support got there if I was left at a flag alone.

\- As a group we try to keep an open mind and are willing to work with all people that share our values.
---
**Guild Structure**

\- We have an experienced core of players with private servers and the original vanilla experience (PvE and PvP)
---
\- Certain positions, schedules, activities will be decided by consensus. Checks and Balances are to be placed on all officers.

Behoove. Haha. And yeah, I agree. I was reading about that as well. If spillover is in fact going to be implemented, and I go for a more completionist approach and hit all of the major early zones:

---
Dun Morogh &gt; Loch Modan &gt; Wetlands 
---
Teldrassil &gt; Darkshore &gt; Ashenvale 
---
I think I could easily get SW and Darn to Exalted by 40, Gnomer and IF will still probably be short due to lack of quest options. 
---
I'll try and remember to hit you up and we can compare where were at when we hit 40. It'll be slow as I'm going to avoid unnecessary dungeons, grinding, and rest exp but I think it'll be worth it.
---
Some high level arguments here ^^
---
Can't do the dps in pve but can destroy them in PvP
---
It's not worth doing dungeons for weapons. Only exceptions might be Corpsemaker if you have a grp for that boss specificly and Maraudon Princess runs (axe or mace + ring).
---
Your main focus should be weapons from quest rewards. Whirlwind Axe can carry you into to 50s. At that point you can get the Beastslayer from Un'goro quest: [https://classicdb.ch/?item=11907](https://classicdb.ch/?item=11907)
---
Honestly, after WWA I'd just smash out 60. Uldaman loot is more of a lucky break if you get it.
---
People really do exaggerate it. I’ve even heard of significant loot/gear upgrades being handed to other races solely because “you need swords”
---
That being said, if I am in a guild, with the understanding that I will receive dagger upgrades after other players, but with the knowledge/understanding that when that first NAXX sword drops, or maybe even thunderfury, it’s mine?
---
...I’m good with that!
---
Suffer for your meme theivery.
---
Why does it matter.
---
Mages suffered in MC/BWL due to everything being immune to their best spec, and polymorph not working on elementals and dragons.
---
I feel yea, I wasn't trying to shit all over you, just so many people act like vanilla is the second coming of christ and I kinda gotta eye roll y'know lol. To each their own, I think most of us agree cata was pretty shit though. Imho up to WOTLK was great, but like late wrath was really weird. I started in wrath, but by the end of it I was kinda like the fuck is this bs, not cause of dungeon finder, but over all balance shit you could see the change in philosophy in the balance crap they were pulling.
---
I downvoted this thread and upvoted yours out of sheer principle.
---
Most graygankers are trying to bait out people like you. So they can kill you to add more salt on the table.
---
Its an amasing feeling to just kill a lowbie. Having them log there main. Die again... come back with a friend.. and die again.
---
Thats communitie, remember his name, remember his guild. Hate him. And when you see him preparing for raids and getting raid buffs.. kill him.
---
Its not cencurus its an invitation to his party, to his way of playing the game. Accept your lose or try winning on his terms.

Feel like you’re forgetting the PvP pop
---
Broken tooth was a nightmare to get, I remember logging out and camping him so I could check at like 3-4 am. 
---
His attack speed was horrible for casters and the interrupt in PVP was so OP for the hunter.
---
Ultimately it doesn’t, just looking for mutual interests since it’s a big one of mine
---
Who the fuck is Harlan? I only know Kevin Harlan. :o
---
I recently leveled a priest on a privat server and I will be playing one as an alt for sure on classic.
---
The only downside is that you need to keep your wand up to date, otherwise you can just grind with zero downtime (once you hit \~50 you might need to drink every 10-20 mobs). Healing as shadow spec in leveling dungeons is rather easy, around 55 you could switch to an AOE build (if Dire Maul is out) to farm lashers for some decent money + exp, you will need a lot of INT though. At level 60 all you need is one point into Holy Nova so you can still get your money with your normal healing spec.
---
Endgame dungeons are usually a lot of fun, you can experiment with downranking, Mind Soothe lets you skip a few groups, Mind Control can carry even a bad group through Strat:L, Shackle gives you an extra disable etc etc
---
If I understand correctly it is just a short form of "Metagaming"
---
I don't think that Metagaming is correct term to use when you talk about PvE. There is no "gaming" because content that you try to beat is static, it doesn't analyze your strategy and doesn't adapt to it. And it is definitely not a synonym to "tactic that yields best results" which is most of the time is meant when you see people using that term.
---
For PvP, on the other hand, it is absolutely correct term.
---
 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metagaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metagaming) 
---
 \`\`\`
---
**Computer games**
---
Recently the term metagame has come to be used by PC Gaming shoutcasters to describe an **emergent methodology that is a subset of the basic strategy necessary to play the game at a high level**. The definitions of this term are varied but can include "pre-game" theory, behavior prediction, or "*ad hoc*strategy" depending on the game being played. An example of this would be in [*StarCraft*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarCraft) where a player's previous matches with the same opponent have given them insight into that player's playstyle and may cause them to make certain decisions which would otherwise seem inferior.

---
Ok. Just a tester question then; 
---
Do you consider ripple a legit cryptocurrency?
---
Okey so its only graphic update on modells and world but old animations?
---
Don't do it bro
---
FYI you don’t need to subscribe you can play to level 20 free
---
this is a good plan. I had this in vanilla, and sent my alt all the poor drops I got and sold the mats. 
---
Like someone said above though, be careful as greens with Agi/stam make brilliant twink gear, and can fetch a tonne of cash on the AH for level 19 twinks.
---
If you’re wondering if I consider XRP a legit currency then yes, ripple is just a company

"Beautiful zones" were all overfocused on Asian culture, while "grim" zones were a boring ugly-bug-mantis thing. If you like all this Asian style then yeah, you wouldn't mind MoP. But if you don't like it or fed up with it in countless other Korean MMOs it may easily cause rejection for this theme.
---
On a similar note: are there any moth breeders in the classic community?
---
I also work shifts. 2weeks late shift (14-22) and 2 weeks night shift (22-7) (Euro time) . Good thing is i always can manage to have all of the morning hours until noon to play. When i have nightshifts i just stay up and go to sleep later the day and when i have late shifts i just get up early when my wife goes to work (she has a normal job shedule and doesnt work shifts). 
---
As iam a very pve and grp play focused player iam looking for a guild wich is active in the early hours of the day (raiding and stuff) . The idea to switch to NA server is pretty neat for times sake but i also have some rl friends wich play on eu servers and we plan to have some playtime on the weekends together ... that wouldnt work if i would play on NA servers... so iam a little bit torn at the moment.
---
Iam currently thinking to open up like a "early bird" guild myself if i cant manage to find one already excisting. I mean i cant be the only one who has that "problem" right? 
---
I hope they will publish their server plans soon ..
---
it had voice chat, it was just so bad, that you could not hear and that people did not use it, going to teamspeak or ventrilo was just better
---
&gt;I REALLY like hunter
---
Don’t over complicate it. If you enjoy it, play it.
---
Convince me to convince you to not play Shaman.
---
Levelling is actually very easy, you are gear dependant on one item alone, your wand. PvP I won't comment as I mainly raided and did dungeons. 
---
Yes you don't have the mega damage output of fireballs or multi dots, but you have incredible regen. With improved wand damage and spirit tap (should be 5/5, 5/5 by level 19) you have no downtime at all. Killing 2 enemies is no problem and 3 is normally ok unless they outlevel you by 2 levels or more.
---
You'll be welcomed to any dungeon as a healer (which is very easy, even as shadow) you have a great toolkit consisting of a HoT (Renew), PW:Shield, and multiple powerful single target heals. 
---
I started life as a Paladin way back when and I couldn't get into it, rolled a Priest though and it all made sense. They are easily my favourite class to play.
---
As a min maxer Feral druids aren't meta but they're fine, both for dps and tanking. They have some problems but are extremely useful, especially at the start don't scale well with gear, they're baseline is very nice if you abuse every possible mechanic powershifting kitty dps is great single target it just falls off as the game goes on because everyone else gets better weapons, which is the exact same as in tbc.
---
As far as something like survival hunters, everything has a place in pvp. Even ret paladins, the most useless auto attacking spec in the game can be useful if you wear full healing gear and act like ur holy, repentance is pretty nasty. 
---
It's okay to roll whatever you want and have fun with it, you can clear MC with like 15 people at the start, you can get carried. If you wanna be a boomkin do it up, blow people up in pvp with it but just have a healing set for raids and if its ur first clear might wanna respec resto for a day. Even as balance spec your just more useful tossing out heals. It's not a mythic raid theres almost no mechanics, min maxing just makes it easier to not fuck up because the boss dies in 12 seconds instead of 45.
---
You couldn't stack them could you? It wouldn't create a campfire too close to another one.
---
In TBC they didnt do enough damage to kill someone. You would reg too fast. Maybe in Vanilla they did more damage, I dont know
---
Who was worried?
---
we don't have the info but I'd guess that it will be old models, old anims, and old world graphics. Perhaps they will put in the option to choose between the old graphics or modern graphics.
---
What are you pairing up for? If leveling, another mage makes farming easymode. For dungeons, another mage. PvP? A rogue or mage. 
---
But tbh, my plan for Classic release is for me and my two buddies to level a warlock and holy paladin with my mage. It might take an extra day or two, but not a lot of people can/will mess with that group (PvP server), and all we need is a tank for any dungeon runs we want to make. (We figure enough people will start out with warriors so we won’t have much trouble there).
---
I know someone will be like “that group is turrible for PvP” because priest is better or w/e - I’m not saying this is min/max best, I’m just saying it works for our playstyle and we feel it’s gonna be fun (like when a rogue tries to sap the pally and gank the mage but just gets feared/seduced by the warlock, then if his buddies join in the pally just bubbles out of w/e to pop a heal. BoP the mage if needed and we fear/poly then watch everything die as we pick who dies next. Then invite anyone who wants to join the fun for great justice and easy leveling progress!)
---

Hah, not even close these days

There's another axe at level 53ish from Un'goro Crater it's called [Beastslayer](https://classicdb.ch/?item=11907)
---
&gt;late 30s : Whirlwind Axe - [https://classicdb.ch/?item=6975](https://classicdb.ch/?item=6975) (I feel like this will be a hard one to get right as you ding 30 on a fresh server, I don't think there will be many people willing to help out farming the elementals in Arathi Highlands, the drop rate is low and the mobs can be tough to kill) 
---
Hamstring kite the mobs with a swing timer or group up with other warriors and it's doable at 30
---
The toggle for old and new graphics have been confirmed thou? There were new worldgraphics and new models on the beta atleast.
---
Here have an upvote, your woosh 'wooshed' other people so now they're downvoting you.
---
im thinking of making a rogue for classic wow 
---
how was rogue?
---
Yes xrp, ripple. What ever.
---
Ok but false answer. Crypto’s were created as a way to have exchange of value without a 3rd party aswel as a limited supply which both don’t apply to ripple since they have a “masterkey” with full controll over their (what they call) “blockchain”
---
...I’m amazing as how many guilds struggle to do this. I wish you the best in finding that balance, but most guilds I’ve known like this attract a lot of selfish people who are going to create a lot of drama over gear drops.
---
Instead of focusing on progression and what is best for the raid to get the next boss down, they want something that gives them an edge in AB so they do... w/e.
---
If you’ve got a mature, sensible group of players, my hat is off to you! Best of luck though!
---
Never knew that, awesome! Can hordes temporarily talk with dwarves then? Or will it still be unreadable for a dwarf?
---
If I remember correctly, they only ever cast one spell in combat; frostbolt. otherwise usefull for having as channeled food dispenser. the other classes werent much better mind you, 40 mans raid meant a lot of brainless stuff, and raid bosses just had "is everyone awake" tests.
---
https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=1686 is the drop im guessing the OP means, this made me a lot of gold in STV
---
"I'm gay"
---
Enjoy the game!
---
It is a limited supply, actually it’s deflationary since I’m every tx a minuscule bit of xrp is burned. How do you know about this “masterkey “? Source?
---
Back in the day i was a Warrior main with a lvl 60 mage alt. I was a tank in MC/ZG20/AQ20 but since i was young and had school i could never put the time in to go any further. Atm im struggling to decide if i want to return to the same thing or switch it up and do something new. I think this time i will be going Druid, because they were an amazing, severely underplayed and underestimated class.
---
I like this idea. 
---
It would be cool if there was a chest in the arena where the loot gets better the longer it’s controlled until looted. Say your group/guild holds the chest for an hour they get better loot than controlling the chest for 5 sec. make controlling the chest like the epl flags or something.
---
Or an arena where all groups get disbanded upon entering forcing it to be a free for all.
---
But in the open world like gurbashi arena.
---
Rust does it fairly well if you're looking for an example of what would work best for WoW (imo). It's proximity based so you have to be close, and the further away you are the quieter it is.
---
Obviously Rust is also full of trolls that do stupid shit like scream "REEEEEEE" or n-bombs down their mics to get streamers banned. Being able to select group and/or friend list only voices would make it better for such incidents. Also a report-voice would probably be needed.
---
Thank you! Lol. Though I found allakazam to be more helpful on rep and I'll admit records from pre-2007/8 Are hard to come. So I guess if rep changed drastically between vanilla and early TBC, that argument could be made.
---
https://web.archive.org/web/20071104060041/http://wow.allakhazam.com:80/db/quest.html?wquest=4495

For exampe: as of Nov, 2007, the quest 'A Good Friend' gave 150 Darn rep, just like it does on most major pservers.
---
You know, maybe they could bring captain placeholder back for a day or two you know. I miss him.
---
Hunter is an extremely flooded class in vanilla due their easy time leveling. 
---
A hunter with real naxx xp? I'd take one any day of the week. You only really need like 3-4 hunters through all of vanilla so you need to make sure they know what they're doing and it sounds like you do and just wanna relive the glory days.
---
I'd say just have a rogue alt to pvp with if you get bored. You can keep it pvp spec all the time and use your hunters money to make the leveling and gearing process easier. If you play alone wpvping on a rogue if one the most fun things you can do along with running around dueling people. Trying to do things along on a warrior or resto shaman is pretty aids.
---
It also makes a good combo, both can control their threat. Rogues actually had feign death until beta patch 0.8 when the hunter class was created.
---
Mortal against cloth, shit against plate. If you are skilled you can permastun anyone.
---
It was difficult to find anything on it in this day and age. Since they have alot of money now they can pay alot of money to have this info unfindable. 
---
https://blog.bitmex.com/the-ripple-story/

Levelling is a glorious journey. You don't just grind for 60 levels on bullshit quests. You picked a side. Horde or Alliance. During all that time you met many allies and many enemies. You got killed by them or killed them just to get 25 bear asses. On its own that quest would be garbage, but with pvp you will remember that time. Someone with whom you fought to get a hold of those asses. Pve kills that part of the immersion. Why are even playing an mmo if there is no danger. You might as well go play some coop. Yes, sometimes it will feel unfair, but every little victory, every goal is part of that journey. I do not care about what you are or what you do or what is your reasoning. If there is a wrong way to play is simply choosing to play pve. If your choice is to play pve wow or not play at all I would just not play at all.
---
I feel like killing cyclonian at the end of the quest will be a bigger barrier, he's a 40 elite and can kill people in their 50s if they aren't careful. You would need a raid full lvl 30 warriors to kill him
---
Yeah if you find a balance between having MoP gameplay but with old talents and working out the homogenization issues then it would be a really good improvement.
---
A more likely ‘switch’ for you might be tank -&gt; healer. Look up Skarm’s ‘Heart of the Wild’ druid.
---
I’m curious as to the original. I used to have a massive Calvin and Hobbs book and this looks familiar
---
Yes it was Ctr+Printscreen 
---
I have tons of screenshots from 2005 and my guild.
---
Hunter is easily up there with rogue as *the* toughest class to play optimally in PvP
---
Cos I'm an idiot!
---
Mages are Gods. 
---
Pretty much great at everything, only downside is their spells are very straightforward so the play style can get a pit boring. 
---
Every talent tree for mage is viable and useful for something and it has the highest amount of actually good specs. 
---
I rerolled to a mage in TBC because they were so good in vanilla at everything. I got bored of it very quickly tho. It's mostly just casting many spells at one thing or blizzard spamming.
---
Properly implemented, I would probably like it.
---
Highest QoL of all classes. Only AoE class in PvP. Solid gold farm and PvE viability.
---
And the pirouette death animation. Majestät feign death a lot more fun

One day, the normies will understand what true value that mothchain technology holds. We'll all be millionaires.

Yup /cry
---
As a mage raiding your responsibilities are:
---
- Dps 
---
- Provide water and food for the raid
---
- buff arcane intelligence 
---
- sheep 
---
- decurse
---
- occasionally detect magic, amplify or dampen magic. Can be used in pulling on rare occasions.
---
Your rotation is simple. But your role is important.
---
Nobody screams when they're MCed off cliffs... It's part of the game. Your only thought should be if you can charge or shadow step an enemy, shift into cat form, pop a noggenfogger, use slowfall/levitate, use blink, ice block or divine shield/bop.
---
Anathema it is then.
---
Here is my thoughts that might help.
---
Maybe you can check out some pvp movies and compare the fighting styles between mage and a warlock since they are so different from each other, some people really like dot's meanwhile some people can't live without a movement ability like blink.
---
I would probably decide the class based on that rather than who is best in what gear, since they are both really good classes, but with vastly different playstyle and feel.
---
But if you only plan to raid, warlocks t1 and t2 are mainly picked up for PvP since they have high stamina and for raiding you want offset pieces for higher crit/spellpower/hit.
---
So you can pickup those for PvP.
---
It's similar to Hunter, where Hunters t1 and t2 is also really good for PvP, but for hunter's it can be difficult to find a raidspot. (many hunter players but you only need a few in a raid)
---
Mage doesn't usually require too much gear so its pretty good if u lack time, you can get rank 10 and be pretty set for quite some time, or even just rank 8 since u will be using engineering helm most of the time anyway.
---
But personally for me it mainly comes down to what style of play your into, since if you enjoy the class you will have more fun anyway.
---
But it’s not fiat... Where does it say anything about the masterkey in the article?
---
There’s so much more that comes with XRP that most people don’t realize is there, cause they’ve been taught that Ripple and XRP is a scam by BTC maximalists.
---
I’m not a maximalist by any chance, but I really advice you to do your own research about this mate
---
Hiding in STV, top
---
Please explain in-depth how you aim to become the "server best PvE guild" and "push to achieve several world-boss kills" while only raiding two nights a week?
---
Mage is great class to play in vanilla. They can be amazing PvPers, are great DPS, can teleport around the world, get free food/water, are the best AOE farmers, and most guilds will bring a decent number on raids.
---
Shaman leveling isn't actually that bad at all, even playing solo. There's a style of leveling where you play like an enhance with a 2 hander and you earthbind kite similar to how a warrior would hamstring kite, but instead of speccing into enhance you spec into elemental and fish for clearcasting procs from elemental focus to stay healthy on mana. I'm not personally experienced with it, but I first heard about it from the youtuber Kargoz, and I'm sure it'll show up in his v3 leveling guide for shaman so you should definitely look into it. Shamans also have the best mobility skill from 20-30 in the form of ghost wolf. During that leveling range they move around the world faster than any other class.
---
As far as rogue goes I'd definitely be more scared of their leveling, as it's one of the worst in the game. Some say it's even worse than warrior, at least when the warrior properly utilizes tricks like the aforementioned hamstring kiting. They definitely get stuck with some of the most boring roles in organized PvP, but they make up for it with how fun they are in wpvp imo. As far as gold making (I assume that's what you're worried about when you say grinding ability) they actually have some very strong and reliable gold farming methods. Pickpocketing BRD is something you can do right at 60 for a solid 50g per hour, and that's raw gold straight out of the game so no need to worry about selling on the AH, although you still can sell the BoEs you get if you feel it's worth it. Then when Dire Maul is released you can do stealth tribute runs with a druid for about 100g per hour EACH. Again this is mostly raw gold from vendoring, but enchanting helps a lot here because the mats will likely go for much more on the AH than some of the drops will when sold to the vendor. 
---
Can't speak much about hunter or priest as I'm not very familiar with them, and I absolutely despise hunters. If anything I hope you don't roll a hunter just so there's one less in the world. This may have something to do with the fact that I'm a rogue main though lol. Hope some of this helps with your decision. Good luck!
---
Everything sounded 10/10 until i realised you plan to raid for 5 hours on wednesdays starting even before dinner time, gl with that. Also imo the name is a huge turn-off for anyone that is not from Finland.
---
Alliance has fear ward and another class that can dispel magic. In group PvP, this is far more annoying to deal with than wotf.
---
Semi-hardcore with spriests, ferals and enh shamans and few requirements for consumables?
---
**How?**
---
Yeah a rogue is easy to play hard to master as well especially in PvP. Tanking can be said the same. It's not incredibly hard to tank but to be a good spacial awareness is a learned skill after many years of doing it.
---
I think it's pretty spot on for the time. Everyone hated MoP during MoP, it wasn't until Warlords that people thought it was pretty solid, and most reactions to that xpac were, like me, a bland  "I think I'll pass".
---
Female undead protesters tank in vanilla. Did it all through ubrs and strat, to mc, bwl, aq and naxx as a main tank in a progression guild. Now, this time around, I'm gonna need everything as a hunter because.. aimed shot. Its gonna be great!
---
Avoiding CC still isn't applying CC.
---
At AQ40 and naxx they change to casting fireball!
---
Username checks out (compliment btw)
---
Calvin was trying on sunglasses iirc
---
If you wanna play it, they are very needed in raids, probably more than anything else horde side. 
---
It's easy to find warriors, it's easy to find rogues, it's easy to mages, it's pretty easy to find a few hunters and warlocks. Priest and druids aren't that hard either, you only need a few so it shouldn't be that hard.
---
Shamans? You want like 8 shamans man and theres not alot of them, it's a free raid spot. 
---
Downsides, you can't be undead and all the races look pretty dumb. And to be useful in PvP you have to play very aggressive, you have no dispel, you can't just sit back and heal, you gotta run in and earth shock casts or your warrior eats a full polymorph.
---
Female dwarf rogue?
---
No I’m not retarded
---
Would you like to join my guild (alliance, PvP server, semi hardcore, main goal clearing naxx with friends)
---
The [Ancient Petrified Leaf](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18703) drops from Majordomo in MC.
---
It gives you a truly epic quest which rewards you a badass epic bow, a staff, and a quiver.
---
You have to travel across Azeroth and solo 4 well-hidden demons that are only interactable by hunters, are challenging to kill, and require special tactics (and skill, like kiting, perfect combination of your abilities, etc.).
---
It is serious business since if *anyone* heals you, touches the demon, or even gets on its aggro table somehow, it despawns.
---
If you see a hunter with the green glowing stick, you know that he knows how to play the game.
---
I had so much fun with that quest line. It was amazing!  Probably my top video game experience of all time.
---
There are a lot of non lethal damage in Vanilla raiding
---
Life is to short to listen to bad music, 
---
play bad video games, 
---
and not roll a class you want to play on *the* Official Vanilla WoW server.
---
I remember back in days Alliance players attacked to Crossroads. Heroic mage invited bunch of people and said "Don't worry I will save you". Then he casted Teleport to Orgrimmar and vanished (he was supposed to cast portal instead of teleport obviously)
---
warrior pvp was nerfed later in vanilla and the talents/power is almost certainly going to be 1.12 in which warriors aren't really that amazing as they were early.
---
Never played vanilla , and i plan to main a rouge cause i never fully played this class in retail and i think its one of the best classes so i ll try it and hope i will have fun with it .
---
I have 0 interest in the lore of it but MoP was great
---
Horde: fancy warmachines Who dont hesitate to help a fella.
---
Ally: crybabies that ask for help when ganked, dont get any and log off.
---
East choice rly

I know this is going to come off as a major shock, but bear with me, okay?

Why not... both?

-Expectations-
---
Looking for a raid guild with a great mature community, while not loosing sight of efficiently clearing ALL content within a reasonable timeframe. Guild should have the ambition for a server 1st till 4th rank.
---
-Raid times-
---
Absolutely flexible as long as it fits my 8-5 CET work schedule.
---
-About me-
---
27 years old - playing on/off since Burning Crusade release. Former raidlead and officer in Mythic guilds up to world rank 200.
---
there should be different kinds of skeletons as undead.. how cool would that be.
---
Can you kill someone though? It's like 5 fire damage every 3 second. It's not the bonfire or the rag window.
---
Not if you were lucky.
---
In wotlk being crit immune definitely was a requirement for any tank.
---
You can just use the staff from Mara quest
---
Lol.
---
Because if you play on a real (PVP) server you can't roll both factions so you'd have to start completely from scratch on a new server, not ideal
---
The real question is, during your limited playtime do you want most of it be with other people? 
---
If it's a yes, warriors pretty good. 
---
If you like grinding alone most of the time, it's a horrible pick. You need a healer with you to do anything and that matters way more than gear.
---
You can get whatever you want but you're pretty useless on your own. If you have a fulltime job but find a shaman with the same schedule as you and you guys get along it can be a blast without a huge amount of investment. 
---
Of course if your going to try to be the best in the world and get every BoE and spend a ton of gold on raid, it will require time, but you spend that time with a healer doing DME jump runs. It could be a blast farming that Arc reaper over a month or it could be miserable looking for strangers to heal you.
---
I love melee dps, but I pick rogue over warr every time in vanilla because I like love playing alone most of the time.
---
Hard pass from me, partly because I don’t want to have to wear a headset all the time and largely because I don’t want to hear retards mic spamming whatever the new hit meme is now.
---
If you want VR chat go and play VR chat.
---
In monster hunter, the term meta is used to describe the type of gear everyone goes for. In monster hunter world, the meta is just to stack as much damage and critical damage bonus you can get, instead of caring about resistances.
---
Because of this, I would say you can use the term meta in PVE games, but perhaps it just depends on the gameplay.
---
You don't use the term meta to determine what armor people use in wow, because the class dynamics are a bigger focus when a group goes into content. Or maybe not I dunno just rambling lol
---
I disagree. It might not be *efficient* from an XP per hour perspective. It’s also probably not worth it to keep doing the same dungeon in hopes of getting one particular item.
---
But dungeons are fun. I recommend people try to do every dungeon once. And as a warrior, if you are stuck with a bad weapon, an upgrade can go *a long fucking way*.
---
And even speedrunners tend to admit that under perfect circumstances dungeons are worth it. If you have a good path that funnels the quests into a dungeon, a group with quick clear speed and no wait time, then a dungeon is among the most efficient things you can do.
---
Warriors can really struggle solo. Especially if inexperienced. Give them a good weapon and they can carry an entire party through a dungeon while holding aggro and doing the most damage. If you get past a certain threshold the game can open up in a lot of ways.
---
Ww axe is indeed great but you can definitely find an upgrade in places like Uldaman. There are multiple options. It’s a fine line you should walk and know what quests to do.
---
Nah. I listen to youtube live radio while playing.
---
" -  No kid should ever be denied the opportunity to get ganked the shit out of in STV "
---
Priest and shaman level pretty easily, Its not as fast as Hunter but it's definitely solidly above rogue, war, pally and maybe single target mage
---
I get the sense you'd at least be able to play enough to get the R10 pvp set and The Unstoppable Force. That will do you fine, while it's relevant - but the game will progress without you. 
---
You've said you: can't sink much time, no mention of raiding, and intend to pvp as much as you can. 
---
With your time, you probably can't push r12+. Without raiding, you'll be hard-stuck with r10 blues and TUF for the rest of the game.
---
You'll probably regret it based on everything you've said, but you should honestly play whatever you want. Priest will be infinitely easier to level, gear and you might be able to find a BGing group you can play with casually.
---
i don't know. Since i've known this sub Nostalrius was always pertmitted.
---
I remember and reminisce more about the original dungeon gear, by the time the upgraded set came out I was in full Tier 2 and don't think I even finished it.
---
But boy did I have many up and downs trying to get that set, but overall one of my purest moments. I was so fresh/clueless back then and I even remember being so upset that I couldn't sleep because I lost a roll for the Kilt of Elements.
---
Yeah that's what I was after, couldn't think of the right way to put it.
---
Yes, just recently we were talking about firelock on my stream. At the moment, its very much reliant on Arcanite Dragonling applying the Flame Buffet debuff but it has potential to shift the "meta". Happy to discuss more, if interested.
---
Surprised no ones mentioned female taurens
---
Honestly back then I would have all the free time in the world now a days I don’t. So I have to stick with one for now.
---
Yeah we did it duo and it’s a busy area. It’s even normal to get some cross faction help on a PvP server (2/3 groups will slaughter you, 1/3 might actually lend you a hand if you have a good emote game)
---
I never said it was applying CC! I said mage CC isn't the best vs Druids

It’s true. It was the best video game moment in my childhood days. Ganks after ganks. People calling in more people. It would get out of hand pretty quick.

Good ole days.

Protip: Start grinding the Jaguars in Swamp of Sorrows starting at ~36. By the time you are 40 you will have enough Gold. If you have Skinning its even more Gold.

Is this him? It looks familiar. I remembered it closely resembled Ziliax from hearthstone. 
---
If that is really you. Please comment on this post.
---
Yeah, but by that time you have already specced into a weapon specialisation.
---
Using an axe grants you 5% crit. A green axe is going to give you more damage than the staff, just because of that.
---
Also, Thrash Blade (awarded from the same q) is vastly superior to the staff. Other than Dal Rends it's prebis, in fact.
---
So good, a true
---
Decide your class then pick what your want your character to be like.
---
If you've decided priest but hate dwarves play horde. If you decided mage but hate trolls play alliance. (of course you can play undead mage or human/NE priest but it's just an example).
---
Just go by what feels good for you and you can't go wrong.
---
As long as you like mindlessly spamming chain heal for the rest of your vanilla career then raiding as shaman is great! Also you occasionally get to wipe the entire raid in nef by getting a class call in p3

Oh man ice block really 5 mins?
---
Play what ever you want, really. I will play a Ret pala, will i be top DPS? Hell no. Can i reach Fame because i am a helpful player that helps people with low level dungeon or protect them in grind heavy ares, yes!
---
You only have to prepare that there will be tons of other Warriors. I think on Pserver Warrior is with Mage the most played class.
---
MB has 30yrd range, MF doesn't. The efficiency doesn't matter as you will easily regen the mana regardless.
---
I only want Groupwide Buff as a Pala or the 1 hours one.
---
It's the feet. A lot of people can't handle the feet.
---
Love Elwynn too man.
---
It is him. Look at his profile the comments are stil there and even the post ;)
---
I played a Warlock during vanilla and I loved him.
---
But this time I'm rolling a different class so I can have a different experience.
---
I'm leaning towards Hunter but I'm not 100% sure yet. Probably between that and a Shaman.
---
I agree 100%. 5% crit from Axe spec is very important with bad gear to get deep wounds more reliable.
---
Thrash Blade  + Mirah's Song [https://classicdb.ch/?item=15806](https://classicdb.ch/?item=15806) is a decent alternative to Dal Rends.
---
Another issue is weapon skills. Leveling weapons skills sucks, especially if you never use it for any other weapon again.
---
Nice!
---
I'm sold. I'm going to be a hunter now!
---
yeah man, druid is possibly the best 1v2 class as well depending on matchup.  as the video that guy linked showed!
---
Cool thank you. I’ll wait for him to reply if he still needs help.
---
I can’t really speak on behalf of either class, because I’ve only played each to about level 10-15ish... 
---
But after watching Platnium WoWs video on rogues, I’m having a tough time choosing my first alt. He made rogues sound very fun! If you haven’t yet, check out his YouTube videos. Great content and the give you a good laugh.
---
Forgot about that one.
---
Procs won't proc procs, so you won't be having 50 windfury procs chaining off each other instagibbing people. Waste of time playing the class.
---
Shiny
---
I know Devout isn't BiS, but I plan to get it all to later upgrade to this set.  I'll be raiding so it's not going to be relevant gear, but I really love the look and the quests.
---
None of the above. Nothing. I wanna play Classic despite some of its bad QoL.
---
Nice. I never used them like that.
---
people healed with 400+ ping back then and it was okay. It all depends on the ping and the times you can play.
---
Yeah, but because of it’s damage/sec compared to MB/wand it just goes faster if you use Mind Flay. So when people say that priest leveling is slow, I feel it’s necessary to show them how to level faster.
---
All of these are a pretty terrible idea. Besides maybe the statistics achievement tab just to keep track of stuff for fun like an addon would.
---
I would really like to say duel spec would be cool, but it wouldn't it'd be completely broken. Some classes like priests are balanced by only being able to spec one thing at a time. Spriest are a rare nuclear weapon that needs to be contained, every priest having access to it would annihilate pvp.
---
The mounts and pets stored in a tab really doesn't matter you're happy to give up the 1 inventory spot for that thing or just don't use it. 
---
Alot of paladin tier gear randomly has some strength on it, even though the paladin uses +healing gear (+spell power didn't affect your heals until tbc) instead of it most of the time theres no other use, and it only be equipped by paladins, so they already have a full "ret" set ready to go, on top of that adding more strength doesn't really matter that much you can still auto attack stuff just fine. 
---
The flightpaths being continuous was added before 1.12.
---
If you want more rezzes as a druid get engineering. 
---
Light Feathers, Fish Oil, &amp; Small Scales all drop like candy and are available at any level of the game, a level 12 bird or a level 55 bird will drop Light Feathers they are not hard to get and go for silver on the AH.
---
FUCK WOD MODELS.
---
That's completely nonsensical.
---
Mages are known for reliable and long-lasting CC in PvE and PvP alike.
---
One class being able to counter it doesn't change that. It's like saying that Arcane Power is bad because priests and shamans can dispel it.
---
Vanilla with no AIDS. 
---
Though a sortable character list before logging in would be nice.
---
The airplane isn't something to go by luckily.
---
MoP classes were amazing.
---
WoD PvP was so of my favorite pvp
---
What (If anything) does rogue vanish remove in vanilla? Will it not work with dots, hunters mark, faerie fire?
---
From u/Xennon who I hope doesn’t mind that I post it here:
---
So just FYI I’ve played vanilla wow since 04 and every year since tbc release on private servers. Up until about two years ago prior to classic wow being announced. I always play warrior, I have done the rank 14 grind as well as cleared all available content more times than I’d like to mention; so I have a strong understanding of the class in PvP and PvE. I only say this you know that I’m not making this stuff up based on nothing. Most of the private server community is toxic and either don’t help or surprisingly after years of playing still don’t know what they’re talking about.
---
Anyways to you point; best way to break this down would be as such:
---
Warrior is amazing in PvP, and very enjoyable if your play type matches. You are a vital part of any premade for BGs as you give mortal strike(reduced healing on target). You are the primary damage dealer on single targets and coordinate your groups kills.
---
If you are primarily interested in PvP warrior is a solid class, a lot of classes are. But you will be greatly hampered by not doing at least dungeons to get the gear necessary to be competitive.
---
How long will this take? That’s up to you and how much you farm gear. Once you’re 60 and running 5 and 10 mans it shouldn’t be but a few weeks till you’re BiS geared maybe sooner depending on luck with drops you need.
---
Once you are geared though you definitely will not suck, you will be the strongest dps class in raids and scary af in PvP. Given that you have a healer. Warriors alone are trash in general, but with someone to assist you they’re really strong.
---
And when I say trash I don’t mean the class, you’ll be super strong, but hunters rogues mages etc can CC you and kite you and keep you at a distance and unless you have freedom potions health potions etc you’ll have a hard time 1v1. But get a healer and you can win 1v2/3/4/5
---
So if you have a group to play with you have little to worry about. Do the standard 60 dungeons and get the appropriate gear and by phase 2 (pvp rank release) you’ll be golden for PvP. You could stick to pvp till rank 14 if you choose to grind it out and with rank 14 gear / weapons you will have gear two raids stronger in advance to normal players. Hope this helped any other questions let me know
---
Anything in Rank 14 gear looks pretty sick, but the horde armor looks more terrifying than being glowing golden boy.
---
Barrens ambiance &gt; All others
---
I agree that you should do dungeons IF you have all(most) of the quests. But it is highly unlikely that you get what you want on the first run.  
---
Another thing to keep in mind is that on low levels you you replace the weapon relativly fast. If you get Strike of Hydra at level 26 you'll replace it with WW axe at level 34ish. That is "few" hourse played time.  
---
If you get Gatorbite at level 50, you might use it until level 60, which is a conciderably longer time played.
---
Good man, thanks man
---
This is beautiful
---
&gt; every priest having access to it would annihilate pvp.
---
Forgot about PvP balance honestly. 
---
&gt; like an addon would.
---
 I'd rather have it incorporated just because we don't yet know what the addon situation will look like. 
---
&gt; mounts and pets stored in a tab really doesn't matter
---
In the grand scheme of things, no, but that's why it would be QoL.
---
I'm rolling a druid tank from day fucking 1, and one of my guildies is rolling druid heals. I've got some other friends rolling Warrior/Mage/Priest/etc. But they're leveling as DPS so (well obviously the mage is) but the warrior and priest as well. So that leveling isn't absolutely mind numbing. At 60 I'll probably tank all our 5/10 man content, and offtank in MC/ZG/Ony/etc. 
---
Druids are amazing in PVP, and they're not bad in PVE... they're one of the best raid healers around. If they're tossing hots on everyone but the tank, it gives the Priests and Pallys more time to focus on the tanks. (Shamans are good RAID healers too, but mostly they just end up spamming chain heal on a tank/off tank/dps group, and dropping totems, all the totems.)
---
17 year old first timer (for classic anyway). Watched my dad play when I was little (mostly watched in TBC and WoTLK but saw a little vanilla as well) looking for a guild.
---
NA servers
---
Definitely Alliance.
---
PvP server type 
---
In the EST zone, so preferable time on is 8:00 PM or later
---
Want to raid but social experience is a priority as well
---
Preferred contact is Reddit PM as I'm on all the time.
---
Rated Battle Ground...yes? In retail there is a separate group looking option, and I don't know if it exists in Classic or not.
---
Does Bobby B monitor other subreddits?

I was seeing them often in front of the second entrance of Stratholme.
---
They were clearly human controlled but I don't know what was happening inside the instance.
---
Yes. Killed plenty of afk low levels this way. Its especially hilarious.
---
Uldaman is also one of the harder dungeons to clear. The endboss is level 47 and you want to get there at level 41-43 before mobs/quests turn green.
---
Benediction
---
Yet unarmed civilians die far more often in the more modern wars than they ever did before those war conventions.
---
Things wont get patched. Its more that Private servers have alot of guess work such as Proc rates and boss armor and spell armor values. The meta for private servers could be quite different from what gets released.
---
I remember my friend telling me about the Garrosh raid and I thought it sounded interesting. Of course the Ally would wanna kill him, and I guess his tyranny made the rest of the horde want to kill him.
---
I'm a lil outta the loop now(haven't really played since Wrath) but isn't there a raid against Jaina Proudmoore now? What's the story to that and how is it different?
---
A low 40s BM hunter can solo it. I’d say cyclonian is the least challenging part of this quest, because by the time a vast majority of warriors can even do the quest there will be plenty of people high enough lvl to help out with the end boss, especially because most people will understand how important it is for warriors to get.
---
"M O R E   E X P R E S S I V E"
---
That's an incredibly decent thing to do, op!
---
Have your upvote, kind fellow
---
This subreddit is about Classic though, and for now that's limited to vanilla.
---
Well the mounts cost money, it's not like you carry around all the shades of your epic, you pick you favorite and only have that 1 and after you get your epic you delete your 60% because it's useless now.
---
Blizz could just give you're backpack like 4 more slots to carry that stuff for QoL but why.
---
And theres no way blizzard doesn't add the regular achievements with just the statistics tab, so good luck getting into an MC pug without linking your BWL achieve.
---
And pvp balance really matters, if everyone is running around as shadow and ele dominating you can't play the game.
---
Or... the player had less health and regents..?
---
Wish Total War had gone with any fantasy universe other than Warhammer. Warcraft, LotR, Witcher etc would've been so much better imo.
---
I feel like this item will be bought out for a week or so after launch and put on the AH, along with the lvl 14 or 16 green bow. Definitely a good idea to check for it occasionally though.
---
Imo, felt like the expansion was aimed at children. Overly colourful, Kung Fu pandas n shit, even the cinematic trailer
---
no nothing has been confirmed, but they have stated several times they're commuted to make everything as it was.
---

It works with everything but faerie fire but you will be pulled out of stealth. I’m not sure if there will be stealth protection on banish but I assume not.

---
Low levels okay I was thinking at some point your spirit/passive regen will out way this
---
Pretty sure it’s only horde attacking Jaina. As alliance you turn into a horde character. Could be wrong though
---
Or play on Asian servers and pay for a transfer when you come back to Europe.
---
You're completely right.
---
People are under the impression that it's an abbreviation for some reason. My LoL-playing friends keep parroting it, so I assume that it was popularized through that game's community.
---
It's been triggering me for a while.
---
Point re BWL/MC. Im solid PvE so pvp balance just didnt cross my mind but you make an excellent point.
---
That's why you rush to get it!
---
Only takes like 4-5 hours into the server before you can buy it.
---
Surprising. Wotlk is often cited as the beginning of the end for classic players with dungeon finder.
---
Look at the morrowgrain quests it's repeatable. And good rep.
---
I don't really care about that stuff but it's very odd when your character's nose has more pixels than your shoulders. Classic gear just doesn't match new models at all.
---
bet you played melee
---
I get that it was in Wrath but Grizzly Hills is the best
---
[Staysafe video](https://youtu.be/28uB4ym6TCM)
---
The theme alone made many players quit the game.
---
Also this ignores the fact that MB is more efficient than MF anyways.
---
Better have a plan B for strike of the hydra as it had a super low drop chance, and you could bet that everyone who could use it would roll on it.
---
Goblins as a playable race, so I can play a good looking Horde Priest.
---
If you did this, you’re an asshole.  Especially since it took so long to scan the AH.
---
Come back from taking a shower and my level 5 alt would be dead and I’d have to scan all over again.
---
Fuck you guys!
---
what? are you trying to make sense and bring logic into this? get out of here nobody wants you /s
---
&gt;  But get a healer and you can win 1v2/3/4/5
---
Surely he means 2v2/3/4/5, it's not really 1vAnything if there is two of you :)
---
More efficient how?
---
Yeah exactly
---
This. People don't give the Horde ambience enough attention. Lok'tar!
---
Shadow step was tbc.

Ah the memories... Just going to leave this here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTFN-V7Sh3w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTFN-V7Sh3w) &lt;3
---
I completed the lvl 30 warrior quest on my own back in the day, I don't remember it being to hard but I also do believe I did the quest at 33
---
Did you really just say “retarded” as an insult? In 2019?
---
Literally spat my coffee out at that sentence
---
This is the same recycled meme from what, less than a month ago?
---
There’s no reason for you to trust me or any other random stranger on the internet, so I’m gonna leave you with a general tip: 
---
Find a content creator specific to the class you want to play, who has verifiable experience. For warriors, Skarm and Monkeynews come to mind, but there is of course a lot more. This goes for all classes. 
---
As I said, you don’t have to believe me, but I think I grasp warrior very well, having played it a lot through vanilla and on private servers. The general consensus of it being the hardest class to level might be fair, but it’s not hard by any means. Tedious is a much better word for it. 
---
If you put in the time to learn, you’ll do better than many other classes based on your knowledge alone. 
---
The same goes for ‘skill’. Wow classic is not a mechanically hard game to master, it’s all about knowledge, good macro usage and managing resources.
---
[This list](https://itemization.info/?search=slot%3Atwo-hand%20source%3Aquest%20source%3Avendor%20is%3Ablue%20is%3Agreen%20sortasc%3Ailvl) might be helpful.
---
Are you dense or just trolling me?
---
I never said mages were bad! They're just a bad match up vs Druids, not all together like you seem to think I'm saying, because Druids can nullify the CC that makes mages so strong in PvP situations.
---
Where boys became men
---
since BC and Wotlk are not in that picture I think MoP was pretty much the best out of these, even tho Legion may come close. I agree that MoP mostly got better over time but damn, never ever was PVP as balanced as it was in MoP! Classes in general were very fun to play and we actually had quite good content in the end with the timeless island
---
I recently learned of WoW classic. I think someone told me last year but i didn't pay mind to it because I was going to quit playing WoW because it wasn't doing it for me. How long exactly have people been waiting for release?
---
&gt; Honestly, the accidents of people forgetting that their mic is on and screaming at their computer during wipes would be off the roof.
---
There are so many worse situation than just someone raging, things like a fan or music going in the backward while they don't say a word other wise. Or them having a conversation with numerous other people in the room with an open mic. Or their dog just barking endlessly because it wants to be let out but they're busy gaming and yelling at the dog to shut up.
---
Sheesh, you experience it in some many other games, it's just about ruined public voice chat in general.
---
I'm glad he paid some credence to Legion. It was a legitimately good expansion
---
Priest/Lock should be just fine I think as you are getting most items from quest rewards anyway and otherwise you`ll just role for it!
---
I think Lock/Priest were on of the stronger duo leveling combs aswell so GL!
---
Alternatively I´ve heard that Lock/Lock is supposed to be incredible too :p
---
Thank me by giving me 50% of the loot.
---
Yeah, I'm not worrying about ping, it looks alright here. Thanks!
---
I don't want Blizz to add any QoL because it was their crusade to QoL away every RPG aspect of the game that ruined WoW.
---
is server transfer from one region to the other possible? Never done a Transfer
---
'Loot so good even hunters ninja it'.
---
Not sure that's saying much tbh, hunters will ninja whatever they can. Nice try though.
---
Holy pala
---
You can't get a crit from a boss L63 when 440 def. Still the defense increases your parry, block and dodge after 440.
---
Although you should NEVER focus only in the defense aspect of a tank since you lose to much damage from defensive items.
---
People running around with 340-360 defense and dualwielding tanks through naxx nowadays. Meta have changed. Tps is way to go, give the raid more space to do good damage. Healers should be able to heal you.
---
The big brain
---
Just depends how you look at it I suppose, thirties feels old I can tell you that.
---
It's a shame that theme is with Pandas as the zones and architecture is really awesome.
---
What is the difference between that and running to each dungeon?
---
Some people since the first expansion...but most people? Ten minutes
---
MoP was waaaay Breyer than legion
---
As in more damage per mana.
---
https://youtu.be/_CLytIpJniY?t=500
---
makes sense too even tho I loved to play my holy pala in MoP as well. But everthing that was wearing cloth got ripped apart hard in WoD warry and dk were super op
---
It’s true! Put some shoes on you hobos!
---
Tauren warrior is obviously most badass. Alliance will stick to you like flies to shit. Noobs will always tunnel ino you while your healers keep you dispelled and WF totemed.
---
The absolute shoulder size is bigger than orc's and with a drawn Ashkandi you are like 14feet tall.
---
Thanks man. I’m not looking for recognition. I’m just trying to give back to this great community.
---
Armor is not a priority over other stats except for intellect for warriors. Even as tanking. For other classes this is even more obvious.
---
That would be best, but can you do those kind of transfers? I thought it was only possible for the same region, so basically only realm change but not the server.
---
Also, are we getting transfer service in vanilla?
---
Nah... The drums get old too fast.
---
They plan on releasing the honor system a phase earlier than the battlegrounds. I’d say that World pvp will happen at that time, but probably on a larger scale - one faction attacking another to try and get a battle going - I suspect the most popular spot for that will be south shore/hillsbrad but I’m sure raids on grom’gol, et al, will draw in world pvp. That might/probably will die after bgs are released I’m guessing.
---
The worst change was what they did to the flat top haircut. They turned into anime crap.
---
Great combo, I recommend just going full combat tho and acting like a warrior, seal of command stun doesn't do enough extra damage to be worth the rogues energy, just do it every time HoJ is up.
---
With a healer rogue has no reason to ever stop killing stuff.
---
I hate ret, I think its a useless spec, but with this combo i'd say the paladin should go full ret for repentance, if you're fighting over territory with the opposite faction, the paladin can catch people with a repent and have the rogue walk right up to them. Movement is a huge issue for rogues in vanilla esp as combat. 
---
Plus if you pull too much like fighting in a cave, repent and blind can save your butts.
---
THIS is wow for me. This is the score I combine with wow. Trust me when I‘m 85 years old and wow is dead for decades (or on its X expansion) I will still recognize this score
---
id rather die than wear crescent staff as a warrior...   
---
lmao
---
Probably not. It was a liiiittle too OP that they were fear, polymorph and MC immune due to being undead.
---
Alliance is literally more difficult than horde - this is why so many scrubs gravitate towards playing horde, then call it “difficult” in order to impress people.
---
Blizzard stated they'll add items the same way they came out in Vanilla, but that items would use patch 1.12 stats when implemented. Since the Bindings both were added to the game in patch 1.6, then you'll have to wait for phase 3 to see them.
---
I'm not sure what "warrior talk" you're referencing. Straight out of the gate with a set of dungeon blues and an Arcanite Reaper, Warriors are very strong. You'll really only be outclassed by Warriors who are lucky enough to get an early Spinal Reaper or Bonereaver's Edge. Later on, yeah, the gear disparity will get a bit worse.
---
The problem with warrior's time commitment is that they generally need to farm a set of tank gear, a set of dps gear, a set of pvp gear, they need to grind a ton of money for expensive BOEs, constant respecs, consumables, etc. If you're only focusing on PvP then the time commitment will be similar to other classes. Just need to get over the initial hump of farming an Arcanite Reaper.
---
The raid you’re thinking about is called the Battle of Dazar’alor, and it is unique in that Horde and Alliance players will have differing experiences. The first three bosses, while mechanically identical, use different models and dialogue depending on your faction. For bosses 4-6, Horde players temporarily become “Alliance,” their races are swapped and they get access to that race’s racials. The same is for the Alliance in the last three bosses afterwards.
---
&gt; a few hours every other day and the odd binge session but that's it. 
---
Forget about a PVP warrior then. You need excellent gear (and some dispellers / healers) to get anywhere as a warrior.
---
If you told me I want to be a casual PVE warrior and tank dungeons I would have tell you go for it you will love tit (and they will love you).
---
Arcanite reaper is the bare minimum you need when people are still wearing green / blue items.
---
Once everybody starts raiding you need an epic 2 handers.
---
&gt; Is all the warrior stuff just talk that's been a little bit overblown? 
---
The levelling yes. I had 3 lvl 60 warriors in Vanilla, never had trouble levelling. Yes my other chars felt a bit easier, but nothing that would stop me rolling warrior.
---
What frustrated me was PVP. I couldn't raid or rank, so my gear wasn't good enough once everybody and his dog was farming BWL / ZG.
---
But make no mistake, what is true for a warrior is true (a bit later) for all classes. Good luck with any blue gear char against players that are farming AQ and Naxx.
---
Honestly, if you like playing the warrior i would just roll one. A lot of people are going to claim that they are the worst to level and you always need to be in a group, but this is simply not true, and there is plenty of information and guides on the internet to help you.
---
I'd say the most important thing is just having a really good weapon (pretty much upgrade every 5-10 levels depending on bracket).  If you know where to go to get a decent weapon, once you get that and a couple pieces of decent armor to boost your stats, leveling is quite enjoyable as warrior. Keep your first aid leveled, and you will blow through mobs without having to eat much. Chain kill 3-4 mobs then bandage, repeat.
---
ToT was cool, the dragon rep mounts were cool. 
---
Loot piñata, intro of titan forging, the monk class, panda race, Island of welfare gear were all much heavier garbage.
---
I’m feeling that the optimistic answers here are from former mage players, since I’m not seeing downsides, only praising. Rephrasing my question, I would like to know the upsides and downsides of leveling a mage in vanilla. As a former rogue, it was not that hard if I was careful to pull and cc the right enemies. One orange was dangerous, two greens were dangerous, otherwise it was fine and almost no downtimes. I’m trying to gauge how a mage would deal with one, two and three or more enemies as I level up.
---
you can kill low lvl AFKers easily
---
"But I'm a warrior..."
---
\*dies from a goblin throwing a dull knife\*
---
Idk anyone who played since vanilla/BC who liked Garrosh as a leader. Killing him was great, being stuck with him as a leader sucked ass.
---
I know both mage and hunter are reasonably good at soloing, better than most. Now whether or not they are better than druid I can't say, I never leveled a druid to any significant level.
---
I doubt you'd have enough money to buy it if you rushed for it.
---
What's 45M Baron?
---
Wait, did they actually remove it?
---
I recall still taking it, but it was like 20 or something and I had like 2k HP or something, so my natural regeneration was higher, and it only made an annoying sound and kept triggering addons.
---
Ten minuter checking in
---
I’d put Ironforge right up there with it
---
I didn't know these were added in BC. I'm going to have to rethink my bank plans then
---
This is what I'm almost excited for for Classic; seeing all the super racist edgelord types who spammed the N word on private servers getting banned and having a meltdown about "muh free speech"

---
Yay, more bouncy disney cartoons &lt;3 
---
Yes, when we look back at it we realized it started things that snowballed into shit.
---
But it was the peak of wow subs, everyone played. PVP was arguably at its peak, and ICC was a fucking amazing raid. Such a great xpac.
---
Your memory is not complete / wrong. I did it at 36 with a low level healer in the zone. It is not soloable on fresh.
---
Is it really worth buying and training staves just for crescent staff? I think you’d probably be ok with just a minor quest/random drop upgrade until Hydra if you’re that determined to keep running dungeons.
---
Tbh I think MOP was actually a solid expansion, it offered a different sort of feel to the game with pandaria. The area was so aesthetically pleasing and always loved going back there levelling alts.
---
well.. reading RBG was a quite common thing in classic too! Although it just meant 'random bgs', as there was no such thing as what you know as RBG. There wasn't even arena, if you didnt know already.
---
...mind. Blown. You, sir, are a genius
---
Not a lot of love for Asian themes in the Western market from what I’ve heard

I'm from Bulgaria myself too, and i find it hard to believe you cant afford 15$ per month (30 leva, which is the local currency). There are loads of jobs in Bulgaria, especially for young people. If you cant find any decent i can hook you up to work in a hostel in sofia, where you will earn 25$ for 12 hours, every 2 days. I can even hook you up with leaflet distributing job, where you can earn up to 15$ for 6-7 hours of walking around Sofia.  
---
Me personally i earn 2k euro in Bulgaria, but im a java dev so that's understandable
---
No. For most classes level 10 is when they have enough spirit to out-regen the damage of fires, braziers, bonfires etc. Don't ask me why I know this because it's not an interesting story. Just the result of being a bored teenager with too much time on his hands.
---
I'd really recommend picking a different race, Night elf doesn't have anything to offer and Night Elf rogue is considered one of the worst race/class combinations in the game. The one extra stealth point doesn't change any breakpoints and so it really doesn't do anything, and the 1% dodge is not going to have an impact.
---
If you're 100% married to how they look then go ahead but people will assume you don't know what you're doing right off the bat.
---
I can't blame you tho, the flip jumps are great.
---
I didn't think of the region thing. You should ask Blizzard.
---
If transfer is not a thing, I'd roll on a euro server, and if I wouldn't be able to raid I would work on a pre raid bis and or PVP set.
---
Or find your future guild and become their dedicated off hour farmer so that when you come back they take you in alt raids.
---
I think in vanilla at max level you pretty much had to strip your gear off in order to die before the fire would go out. But if someone was AFK and you brought them down to 1/2% hp then lit the fire I suppose it would do the trick!
---
How easy MC is depends entirely on how much of the raid encounters private servers got right. We still have to remember that raids on pservers are mostly guesswork.
---
I think he meant 4 different kinds of raiders.
---
You could only kill people with it in the beta/early patches afaik. Quote from the WoW Diary by John Stats:
---
&gt; "Another “grief” Roman found was killing AFK (away from keyboard)
---
players by building campfires at their feet. People returned to the game
---
to find their character dead in what was supposed to a safe area. Roman’s
---
trick convinced game designer Eric Dodds that player-created campfires
---
shouldn’t do damage."
---
Still does as a 32 year old. I got the warlock set because it looked cool. Thought I looked like a ring wraith.
---
Yeah but I'm currently in a village and will be there up until summer so there's really not much you can do here.
---
Gotta wear them down to 1/2% first I think
---
Time zone and faction?

* We play Prot Warrior, Holy Priest, Mage, Warlock and Rogue

LF Decent guild that aim to start raiding within 8 weeks of classic wow, we're no noobs and have cleared everything up to Naxx. Several of us raided in guilds that

had all content on farm on Nostalrius.

Hit me up here or add discord Nhetik#2307
---
Chromaggus, Nefarian and patchwerk are the bosses you need to focus on more defense. All other is just plain tps.
---
Even chrom and nef is doable without even close to 440. Patchwerk tho you need more focus in def cap (440). Might have missed some boss.
---
The only real downsides to mage are your setup times when you play (making food, sometimes for multiple people..and mana gems) and behind to use that food fairly often, but it's free!
---
What you'll save in food cost gets absolutely destroyed by the cost of teleport and portal runes, though
---
Don't worry, since you'll have a shitty weapon to replace Crescent Staff, you'll die a lot :p

12 is after 4 and 5...just so you know

Wow logic. "My eyes are full of dirt so I will set myself on fire to see again"

Well.. You can't be **GNOME MASTERRACE**.
---
I’m not going to disagree here, but that’s because I wear plate.
---
Runecloth turnins wont be there from launch i would pressume, other then that its morrowgrain turnins (if that will be avalable) and quests.
---
Which is why you should always get a 100HP and some spirit enchants on your bank alts.
---
74 silver is probably all the money you have. Nothing left for abilities / food etc
---
Yep. Also in more prosperious countries there is always a possibility of a lengthy ilness burning out all person's savings. Life can be very harsh sometimes.
---
&gt; Yeah, but by that time you have already specced into a weapon specialisation.
---
I know that you get 5% crit from axe specialization, but there's this thing called 2H fury.
---
Do you know if they've commented on keystroke broadcasting? Playing 6 characters and plowing through content seems like a bigger deal than auto accepting a quest
---
I would have to disagree. While Blizzard has rarely been capable of telling nuanced stories (something they haven’t really been capable of since WC3 or Starcraft), I believe MoP was perhaps the closest they’ve gotten in a very long time.
---
A major theme of the expansion was the power of negative emotions, and how important It is to balance them with the positive. The entire culture of the pandaren revolved around the suppression of emotion, as showing any negativity like anger or fear would unleash the sha, the final echos of an Old God.
---
Garrosh, however, went through the other extreme. He tried to harness his hatred, rage, and fear and not only use them, but rule by them. The Horde became a repressed police state as a result, one that favored Orcish heritage no less.
---
While MoP could still be silly at times, and in true Blizzard fashion was also bombastic and crazy with how it delivered its story, it tried something new and, in my eyes, succeeded.
---
Well I love the drums when you enter the gate of Iron Forge!

No hassle bro, as you may have seen on this reddit, there is a dude who is already looking for you who wants to give you money so you can play Classic. If you ever find yourself in Sofia, drop me a PM so we can meet and I can get you a months subscription :)
---
wat
---
If you’ll play a tank I’ll heal you anytime.  I’m mage who is dabbling into priest because I don’t wanna wait all day for groups.  So maybe not the best response to your question but tank healer sounds like hella fun duo leveling
---
Arms isn't the only way to level. 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=17743 with 2H Fury is way better than anything arms can offer.
---
Is this what you are looking for? 
---
https://youtu.be/NXX8URSUWm0

Evretiem!!!
---
Well I know for a fact a ton of mechanics on private servers are just entirely false. But that doesn't mean they'll be harder. 
---
Good example is the Rag knockback effects his entire hitbox on private servers, but in real vanilla it was tank only mechanic and only affected his frontal cone. You can see this in the world first MC video, none of the melee dps ever get knockbacked while attacking behind the boss. However the durability loss effect may be very undertuned as well.
---
But with what we know now about items and consumable cheesing i'm confident the fights will still be pretty trivial. Harmful effects on players can easily be removed now with consumables like resto pot and FAP you can completely avoid mechanics blizzard wanted you to deal with, which is pretty much the meta on private servers if the boss actually lives long enough to do any mechanics. 
---
Another example is burning all of Shazzrah's mana so he can't do any mechanics was a real strategy in real vanilla, but on private servers his abilities don't cost any mana so theres no reason to do that. 
---
You're 100% right about them being incorrect values and hazy memories, but the real deal could be even easier.
---
Spirit is OP when you level up, never realised it but it's without a doubt the best stat :o
---
Level on a private server and see what you like. There’s plenty of time.
---
Thank you so much for the kind offer, but I should be able to work as an interpreter around June. So I might just not be able to play the first month and then come.
---
About 25 years.
---
Came here for this.
---
Thought I saw in some video they said no to achievements. Never was in vanilla and I never had a problem getting into a raid. If you suck you don't no loot and the boot
---
&gt;Neither the PvP nor the PvE spec is really good for farming
---
What spec do you use to farm as a shaman ? Enhancement ?
---
I think it's pretty complicated to outline. As a low skill player my thought is that it's going to depend at minimum on your skill level, and the type of PvP (World, BGs, maybe duels i guess). 
---
As a brief example - lets look at warrior versus X at "low to average" skill:
---
Warrior eats rogue
---
Frost mage eats warrior
---
Shadow Priest eats warrior (even if they're asleep)
---
As you move up in skill cap and maybe gear, certain matchups become more competitive. In a 1v1, world pvp, or even BG a rogue played well can beat a warrior, but this is very unlikely at lower skill levels. Meanwhile the shadow priest and and frost mage are still blowing the warrior up. 
---
I've seen a lot of discussion lately about skill floors, and skill ceilings. I don't have nearly the wealth of experience to list them all out, but I feel like that would be a good approach to educate the masses.
---
This comment is a prime example why you don't want to be Horde.
---
Warrior beats everything
---
NOOOO!!!...but my shaders!...and anti aliasing!!!
---
I didn't know that.
---
As said, mages are great in AoE. Pulling multiple enemies at once is not a big deal. You will eat and drink a lot after the combat has ended.
---
Why the big hate against pandas? They where allready in the lore in Classic it was just a matter of time until there would be an expansion about them, I was always curious about them since I heard about them.
---
Ye, if you are 10...
---
It's expensive but a common trick is to borrow a bit of silver from a friend to get it first. It's completely do-able to get it at 14 though as long as you don't waste money on things you don't need.
---
Dude that's retarded wtf I can't believe it
---
I also strongly remember this. I remember discussing boss strategies and people wanting to see if we could use campfires to break CC and it didnt work.
---
People have tried and tested this method it's really sick to rush hsm and there's always competition for it on pservers.
---
Did you read my comment above? I'm not saying there will be achievements, they will definitely not be achievements in classic, and i'm explaining why that is. 
---
And theres no determination of skill for an invitation in vanilla, you have to guess everyone skill level when pugging unless you have information on it already, and I'm saying that's a good thing.
---
&gt;If you suck you don't no loot and the boot
---
Rewrite your second sentence.
---
My first reaction to the first graph, it doesn’t spike Mind Flay’s Damage at level 40, meaning they didn’t include Shadow Form. I’ll keep watching though.
---
Any specific improvement you'd like to see? feel free to create an issue [here](https://github.com/itemization/itemization.info/issues).
---
My life is so full of action and adventure that I don't mind taking a break with some "dull" WoW classic or Diablo grinding! ;)
---
It's a good thing there's multiple PvP realms.
---
It is indeed Karazhan but taken before TBC came out
---
I think on pure subscriber numbers it was.  At the time I think everyone loved it because it was kind of extension of the Vanilla/BC playstyle and mechanics.  I don't think people at the time realized the complete cancer that LFD was until it was too late.  Hindsight is 20/20, after all.  It's kinda like that old wives tale of if you drop a frog in boiling water, it'll jump right out.  However, if you drop the frog in the water when it's cold and heat it up around him, it'll die before it realizes it's too late.
---
Wrath was the point that Blizzard turned the burner on full fucking blast.
---
Hunter. Will be rogue or lock this time.
---
Every guide quest saying that you cannot kill solo cyclonian, need party or help of higher level, so hmmm
---
Then you just answered your own question. If you don't have enough time, dont play something that's not familiar to you. Or else leveling will take longer, with the little time you have.
---
It's the third beam that goes on raid, 2 on first pull target 3rd on random. Although There are plenty of tactics for "pulling" C'thun. Whatever works for the raid, you should go on. The pull can be tricky for a new guild progressing c'thun.
---
There's no real simple way to outline it. It's just that some matchups are favored for one class even if the other class has good matchups versus a lot of other classes.
---
Like say hunters. They beat almost every class quite easily. However they actually have a challenging matchup versus warriors, eventhough warriors are beaten by almost every class.
---
Sounds like you understand where I'm coming from.
---
I like new SFK over old SFK though.
---
No changes. While it is tempting and vanilla has obvious design flaws it's like opening pandoras box.
---
They did not
---
As somebody who was alliance whats so special about the barrens chat? I mean Ive read enough to understand what there was going on I just dont understand why? Why in why the barrens? Its a low level zone and you should have no reason to hang around there? I mean I would understand it if it was maybe the chat right before orgrimmar where everybody would hang out to duel or something like that, but why Barrens chat?
---
Comments like yours are what people usually refer to when saying "this sub has gone to shit".   
---
If you think youre smarter than anyone else, go away
---
I played a Troll Shaman back in vanilla. I intend to play as an Human Rogue now because I always played Horde character, even in private servers, so I would like a change and to have things feel fresh as there are some low level alliance zones I never bothered to know well enough.
---
OH man I'm on the border between rogue and mage, I forgot all about the red bandit mask from Deadmines... hmmmm
---
Started playing in BC as a Warlock. I plan on rolling Warrior for classic, because the PVE game play for the casters is dull as all hell. 
---
I'd like to roll Mage, but casting nothing but frostbolt until AQ40 sounds terminally boring.
---
This is very useful!
---
How about pve. I'm in the situation where I want to play as a warrior. I love tanking and dpsing with them but also know that I'll never have the time required to main tank.
---
Can you can end game dungeons in dps spec? Do raids always take dps warriors who are happy to off tank.
---
Whenever I ask about warrior tanking I'm always told "don't bother unless you can no life it" so what about a hybrid of tanking dungeons and dpsing in raids?
---
But it's also a prime example of why you want to be horde... You don't have to deal with dudes like him on the other faction corpse camping you.
---
This doesn't put the horde in a good light, but he is one of the few. I play a lot of pservers, both horde and alliance, ganking happens on both sides in equal measure. But, i've only ever been spawn camped to the point where i have to log off and play something else by alliance whilst playing horde. So make of this what you will
---
I played mop a week and quit. Played Wod a month and quit. Mops story and environment were just sooooooo bad.
---
Honestly I don't understand how they got their numbers. I just accept them at face value because they made a nice graph and obviously spent more time than me to think about it :)
---
Bubble &gt; MB &gt; SWP &gt; MFx2 &gt; Wand will get the job done. Add or remove MF casts depending on your mana situation.
---
Always Hunter for Life.
---
Druid for helping others.
---
Are *you* dense? The original post even explicitly clarified "DPS wise no one could beat a mage with their DPS and CC" - pay special attention to the first two words of the quote.
---
It was never about a who is able to literally beat a mage - plenty of classes can. 
---
It was about comparing overall performance within a given role, in which mages excel at reliable CC and do good damage.
---
Being able to counter something doesn't make you good at the thing you countered, and it's completely irrelevant in PvE.
---
Yeah that's kind of the thing for me, I totally see the enjoyment of wpvp with two evenly matched sides going at it! But in my mind that will be the anomaly and the normal situation will be unwinnable 1vsX fights or rogues camping outside of dungeon enterances makingsure it takes even longer to get a group into a dungeon. I take as little enjoyment in ganking helpless players as I find it challenging to get gangbanged. However, with modern communication it may be easier to setup large wpvp events, so perhaps wpvp will be even better in classic! :)
---
WotLK was the peak and it was the last to break new ground in terms of sub numbers, but the increases in subs were far more gradual and slight than the massive spikes vanilla &amp; TBC oversaw. Stuff like the Argent Tournament did too much to drive off older players even as it drew in more - it was still spectacular but it's clearly when wow started to move away from the things that made it successful and I consider TBC to be the best of WoW for that reason.
---
this won't be relevant for the patch version classic is launching at though, at the start warlocks may have been weak but in 1.12.1 and a bit of gear warlock turns into a hit 2 buttons to melt anything class
---
Given this update, this is exactly the rotation I’d use.
---
Stick to retail
---
As for leveling speed this should not be a concern in my opinion. You will outlevel the gear pieces with worse gear faster than you would need for aquiring these pieces of gear.
---
I personally however really enjoy going for better gear. For me the leveling is a HUGE part of the game and I dont rush it because I really enjoy leveling it. I enjoy going to certain instances many times while leveling. I often go as soon as I can (as a healer that means I am often not even eglible for quests).
---
So if you want to level fast skip gear mostly with a few expections (try to get good weapons as melee or get a good wand as a priest for example).
---
If you enjoy the leveling instances and are not concerend with leveling time like me go for all gear you can.
---
The reason almost everyone plays female on private servers is because in warsong on the alliance side theres part of the fence you can jump through if you're character is female and you can't jump through if you're male.
---
It doesn't matter if you're a tauren or a gnome, it's just male/female. 
---
And in super high tier premade vs premade this matters alot. But it will probably be removed in classic.
---
Alliance quests are better. The onyxia chain quest on the alliance side is one of the best quests ever implemented. Also Ironforge &gt; Orgrimmar
---
The fact anyone would choose human in a fantasy game boggles my mind.
---
I'm thinking....rogue, nah no way -- gnome mage, rogue? Nope, human warlock, did someone say rogue? How about a nelf druid? Nah, ima roll dwarf rogue
---
You know how when you create a new character they all spawn in the same spot, now imagine you put like a hundred different campfires on that same spot...
---
I recently ran a guy through Borean Tundra and couldn't help but notice that Garrosh was kind of a shit leader even when he was only in command of a single base. If it weren't for Saurfang he probably woulda got overwhelmed by the Scourge before long.
---
This was always my favorite Alliance song, something so mystical about it:
---
[https://youtu.be/GzUB-9ElhVk?t=4061](https://youtu.be/GzUB-9ElhVk?t=4061)
---
Laughs in mage
---
Id be blasting Erika goosesteping through the barrens fo sho
---
I didn’t write that post, but based on everything I’ve read DPS PVE Warrior is Tier 1. The no life stuff comes into play for Main Tanking. It’s so much responsibility
---
But there was no specification that it was PvE, it said nobody could beat a mage with DPS and CC yes, but damage and CC applies to PvP just as much
---
&gt; Assume each pet will have their own attack speed dictated by their pet family.
---
No. Attack speeds weren’t normalized until TBC. No reason to assume they will be in Classic. Lupos though, that change happened during Vanilla, so there’s no telling which version we’re getting.
---
Idk winterspring is pretty damn relaxing.
---
If I played Alliance I’d probably play humans I like how they look in gear.
---
As I said, not ideal. Not impossible, but not ideal.
---
Ooft, dress ups like retail transmog
---
Yep, i mean my server back then did have wpvp events like at crossroads in barrens etc. you can make that happen on both types of servers but the levelling on a pvp server is gonna be a pain for sure.
---
The portals and food/drink alone are enough to make me go mage again. One big thing I think people are forgetting it how long it takes to get around. Portals are gonna be in big demand again.
---
not everyone plays fantasy because of the silly looking characters lol
---
&gt;Rewrite your second sentence.
---
Since we are being asses, perhaps you should proofread as well.
---
That's what you think. Let the vanilla dream love on!
---
I'm not sure what you mean by hopefully they will realize it.  There wont be any class changes.
---
You and the other 35 people at all times
---
balance is a constantly shifting meta / reliant on spec variations / cooldowns / consumables / engineering / map layout.
---
In any given situation (say guarding a flag) balance will go one way.  Take the exact same players and put them in a different situation (protecting a flag carrier) and the balance change.
---
Same again, but give one team consumables and its all turned about again.
---
This is why vanilla is so fucking awesome
---
It's beyond rare to find a good druid PvPer though. Which is probably why these players try and engage Storm even though he got the opener. The vast majority of druids can't beat anything in PvP so they are usually free kills... Usually... But then someone like Storm comes around and dominates everyone and you sit there, looking at your corpse, pondering what just happened and if you should reroll.
---
This sub is for Classic.  Were pretending its 2004.
---
Not trying to get into an argument, but perhaps someone appreciates a second perspective.
---
&gt; But it is highly unlikely that you get what you want on the first run.
---
I could not disagree more. If you look at Uldaman, you have a 2/5 chance to get either the two handed sword or the two handed mace from the boss at 43 DPS (up from 36 DPS), which is a nice 16% increase in DPS.
---
Even RFD has a tiny upgrade at 1/5 (and is a super quick and efficient dungeon).
---
ZF has a 44 DPS staff at 1/5. And a 43 DPS polearm at 1/4.
---
That's a 71% chance to get an upgrade to the WW Axe by doing one very good dungeon, one dungeon that is not so great and one decent dungeon.
---
I agree with low levels. *But*, I don't agree with Corpsemaker. RFK is such a quick and good dungeon, IMO it is worth it to do it a few times. It drops at 2/5. I would definitely look for a group really quick whenever I have a good opportunity of turning in a lot of quests or having to move between zones. But I would only go there, if no other people want the axe (so no Shamans or other Warriors mainly. I don't think druids really want it).
---
Is getting Corpsemaker efficient? Probably not. But at 40%, IMO you should do RFK at least once. Replace Corpsemaker at 30 with the WW Axe (pay someone if you have to, getting it a few levels early will pay for itself).
---
After that, hope for an upgrade but WW Axe will get you to ~ 50 if you are unlucky and don't get an upgrade. I would not grind RFD for the weapon. And I recommend against doing multiple Uldamans. Zul'Farrak could make sense depending on what kind of ZF run it will be.
---
Don't get Strike of the Hydra. You need to do Akumai runs and it drops at 1/5. If you get it good, but I would not count on it. And it does not really matter with RFK runs being ~ 30 minutes and dropping Corpsemaker at 2/5.
---
I also recommend against Gatorbite. People need to decide for themselves whether they do Maraudon or not (I would only do a full clear with a very, very good group). If things go wrong in Maraudon you can look at a nightmare that takes 6+ hours at no end. People need to decide themselves whether they grab it. Drop is 1/5. Sure, perhaps you are lucky and get some princess runs going with a friend. But if you just did the fun thing: Do every dungeon once (with the one exception being Maraudon), then it is very likely you already have an upgrade that is probably even stronger than Gatorbite.
---
You'll never go back from 144hz once you've experienced that sexy smoothness.
---
If you want to PVP you have 3 (2 for a while) BGs. You have to run to each entrance just to queue and then as soon as the BG is finished do it again, all day. It's a nightmare. 
---
Dungeons you're generally doing one specific one. Far less of a headache to go there once. Even if you're farming it you don't have to bounce between two zones just to wait to get in.
---
Claming that classes/playstyles are more complex in classic is just plain wrong, retails is a lot more complex in almost every aspect.  
---
What suffered is class identity and character development, the main rpg aspects.
---
50+ mighty ucha quest 2h Axe

Welcome friend! Glad to have you!

I saw a group of people burn an afk bankalt to death with campfires in ogr. The image will never leave me.
---
Scan AH?
---
You really don’t see how your changes would ruin the entire game?
---
Nice
---
since WOTLK
---
That’s my thought exactly, also they run like fucking teletubbies. If Im gonna run from Darna to IF I sure as hell aint looking at those wonky animations.
---
Achievements? Op is a troll
---
It’s actually best weapon for that level horde side.
---
Sorry for offending you and killing your first born. Jeez....
---
this is my fav
---
youre first mistake is asking these spergs what they think.
---
Someone will correct me if I give wrong information, thereby answering your question: so I’m pretty sure Blizzard officially announced they would launch Classic WoW back in summer of 2012.
---
(Jk, Blizzcon 2016)
---
P.S. actually summer 2018
---
P.P.S. Blizzcon 2018
---
P.P.P.S. Whatever someone else on this thread actually replies with viable, useful information
---
P.P.P.P.S. Reddit comment threads on this subreddit are like trade chat
---
Warriors in pvp should be arms which means a disgusting amount of respeccing. If you're game then yes you can have fun with it.
---
Music off &gt; All
---
WoW was never difficult. The top end activities like world first racing in raiding or high pvp duels are fair points but most of the game is not complex by any means. It's more about forcing you to think if you want to be effective and not wipe. The game will stop you if you try to faceroll the content but it only makes the victory better when you fail couple times imo.
---
dude what does "if you suck you don't no loot and the boot mean? I"m not being an ass I don't know what you're trying to say lol
---
Warrior without heal/dispel is pretty useless against most classes.
---
But the real question is what shirt do you wear to be the best looking. Without that you just look like a dwarf wearing a dress.
---
Speaking of CC, there are some items that give you some good combat buff, but make also you take like 10% of your health in 10 seconds, or something.
---
Does it mean that CC's that break on damage break every second? If so... then that's a quite OP PVP trinket

That's a shame, since MoP has a ton of great stuff. You've got the Sha, remnants of an Old God killed by the Titans, the Mogu, an extinct civilization that enslaved the entire continent, the Klaxxi who are simultaneously fighting against the influence of the Sha while awaiting the rebirth of the Old God who spawned them, the Zandalari who once ruled the entire world, the August Celestials that are the natural gods of the region, and then there's the groups like the Tillers and the Lorewalkers just to flesh out the story. It's maybe worth a second look.

Apology accepted

"20 scarlet thots rush to sex him back to recovery after he is defeated"
---
I fucking lost it and had to explain to my coworkers what I was laughing at.  WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?
---
I know, how dare they use an existing fan favorite race that people have been asking to play as and has an established character with at least one reference in WoW rather than pull something out their asses.
---
Mage kick ass at leveling, but what it really comes down to is what you want to raid or pvp with. Mage do perfectly fine at both though so you might be fine.
---
If you're interested in this sort of thing you should dig up some old blizzcons and dev discussions about their opinion on classes. 
---
Preach said in Cataclysm they made many things in the game harder to bring back the feeling of hard TBC heroics that was lost with super easymode WOTLK heroics. Despite homogenization and pruning Cata rotations were an increase in difficulty, players responded with outrage and blizzard has made every class easy to play since then and removed hard mechanics like multidot snapshotting to avoid potential player outrage. 
---
This is the opposite of the original dev's opinion, it was always the plan to add more and make things more complex as time went on, which is why every class got like 4 new abilities in TBC and that was a clear design choice. 
---
They didn't abandon new players tho, they kept some things just downright easy. Jeff Kaplan (the overwatch guy) says on video at the first ever blizzcon that Paladins got pruned to be easy. In earlier beta builds they had abilities like Crusader Strike and Holy Strike, but since they were so cool in WC3, blizzard new non mmo players would select the class and so the made it more supporty and easy and removed those.
---
As a paladin you literally have no attacks in vanilla just seals to buff your autos and that was fine. I picked Paladin as my first class to heal for my friends and in TBC I moved on. There should options for beginner players but you're 100% right, blizzard has made every class like this and lowered skill gaps on purpose in the current game.

Green quests give as much XP in vanilla so it doesn't really matter. 
---
But you definitely want to be closer to 44-45 than 40-41 if you intend ot complete Uldaman. And there are only like 2 quests to do inside as horde. Huge waste of time.
---
people still don't understand that prebis is a pve concept?
---
Any word on whether non viable specs will be tweaked for Classic?
---
Jesus christ, man - ok, let me try to *really* dumb it down for you.
---
**Can a mage do more damage than a druid? Yes. Does a mage have more reliable CC than a druid? Yes.**
---
If both of these are true, then the mage is superior to the druid when it comes to DPS and CC, which doesn't change when the mage loses to a druid countering him in a PvP situation.
---
I repeat, from my last post which you seem not to have read -  **It was never about a who is able to literally beat a mage,** in fact I'm pretty sure it wasn't even supposed to include PvP.
---
If you still don't understand after this, I give up. I literally cannot simplify it anymore.
---
When you zone out of the instance you are where you queued though? Why are you running again? You should be right outside
---
I agree - many PVE rotations are dead simple in Classic andonly got more conditional and challenging with later expansions. 
---
Honestly I'd love to see some changes to 1.12's class balance - nothing major but I'm sure a few new (or adjusted) drops for underutilized speccs and maybe slightly tweaked numbers on some skills would do wonders. That's what they did up until 1.12 anyways.
---
Banana human warrior for life!
---
That’s the guy you ask round for a threesome.
---
Did frost not get a bonus as you were in a fire scenario?
---
I don’t remember seeing anything other than frost mages back then but can’t remember if the other specs just weren’t viable or if frost was just too good for MC
---
&gt;if you suck you don't no loot and the boot
---
 if you suck you don't get  loot and the boot(kicked)
---
True class-to-class balance would mean that every class has equal chances to beat every other class. That's not at all the case in vanilla (and it would suck in my opinion). Rock-paper-scissors implies that A beats B beats C which beats A. That would occur if every class had definitive strengths and weaknesses that matched the strengths and weaknesses of another class in a round-robin kind of way. That's also not really what's happening, but it's a little bit closer than "everything is balanced". It's more that class and build provide toolsets that players can use along with their class strengths and weaknesses.
---
Personally, I like new models except for gnomes and tauren. They tried too much by painting gnomes in a more realistic light and now there are just creepy. They completely lost the goofiness. Tauren are the opposite. They looked intimidating and now they are goof cows.
---
I’ve been thinking about this a lot, and I’m pretty confident that I can buy the charms for WW Axe and get my mount right at 40.
---
I tried to recreate the Vanilla face in the character screen for a better comparison.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/hmKTSjd.png](https://i.imgur.com/hmKTSjd.png)
---
I think the new models look good. The running and jumping animations are a little too dramatic but I prefer the new models to the old ones.
---
Sorry, not happening.
---
Easily solo-able as soon as 50 if hamstring kiting works to some extend on the Classic client, which we are not sure so far but a ~~man~~ warrior can hope...
---
Upsides while leveling:
---
- Can mass AOE 5-10 mobs (the fastest levelers are mages if they are uncontested in their AOE farming spots)
---
- Decent single target killing
---
- Polymorph available
---
Downsides:
---
- Uses quite alot of mana pr. mob so you need to drink alot
---
- Squishy if things go wrong
---
- AOE grinding requires full attention and focus.
---
Do you hate gnomes? If you hatred for gnomes is anywhere higher that tolerable than role horde.
---
Mind control him off the Clift now!
---
in what universe is a priest easier to level than a druid?
---
What I remember back then was people said "Go Frost because Molten core is immune to fire"
---
However no one ever said anything about arcane, people just kinda laughed at arcane missles due to it's cost. Even though it had insane regeneration capabilities when built with spirit
---
In early MC videos most mages are spamming arcane missiles and that might be the reason why. It's very possible clearcasting could proc off every missile hit, throughout all of TBC it can proc off of individual blizzard ticks.
---
One of the downsides to this being no +arcane damage on gear, however +(school) damage gear was added with updated itemization.
---
On private servers most of the serpentscale bosses like Lucifron have like 200 arcane resistence, I don't know if this is blizzlike tho.
---
Great info! I appreciate you taking your time writing it. Thanks!
---
Undead mage in vanilla.
---
Kept the mage and added a human pally in BC. 
---
Rolling dwarf priest because I liked the healing/support playstyle more, and I really want to progress through more raiding. Also, I really want anathema/benediction.
---
I just loved the play style. Idk what they went wrong with afterward. It was a shame
---
WOW radio back, please
---
I’d say they’re even.
---
Paladins throw blessing of sacrifice on a warrior or something to keep themselves out of cc.
---
Thank you for the heads up.
---
Playing feral in PvP seems really enjoyable so I might grind it.
---
Also did you raid as full feral or did you do the 0/30/21 build?
---
Well now you do :b only warsong, arathi and alterac were available in terms of instanced pvp.
---
oh, so you get invited then kicked? I thought you were saying you wouldn't get an invite at all. I agree with you then.
---
a reliable fury willing to offtank when necessary will get plenty of tank loot during raids once the first line of tanks get them. once you have a few pieces of raid gear, you can tank dungeons in dps spec and steamroll everything more or less
---
"Downsides, you can't be undead and all the races look pretty dumb"
---
Huh? Dumb? I guess that's a subjective opinion :)
---
I rolled a hunter cuz I'd never played any games like this b4.  I loved having a pet to sacrifice when i was making noob mistakes (thank you, FD).
---
However, after playing around with a frost mage on a priv-ahem... server, i think that is what i will start out with. I'll roll a male troll, most likely, even though idk if I'll be able to make time to raid. AoE grinding is a fun way to grind when questing gets annoying or the area is overpopulated making it impossible.
---
Same. Was rogue now going Druid since I want something new but love that stealth.
---
If I was running a more optimal healing spec like full resto or moon glow but had a full set of tanking gear would it be possible to tank dungeons? I’ve heard from some people that you can tank dungeons with any spec as warrior so I was wondering if this was the case for druid as well
---
that alone would explain a lot
---
Did they make any expansion based on a single race that was added in it?
---
Thank you all for the answers, I think I'll level a mage then.
---
It's not my opinion I like orcs and trolls, but I've heard it around alot and I wouldn't wanna main a tauren for the same reason so I get it I guess.
---
The AoE version is summoning an infernal and banishing it in the AH, the fire aura still ticks and kills most level &lt;10 bankalts.
---
Right in the feels, man.
---
I sincerely hope that the take away from all of this is that community/social engagement gives MMOs longevity and can be profitable. WoW is the only game ive ever played that bonded players enough where we would keep playing together and talk about IRL shit constantly in guild chat, etc.
---
As much as i think all of the PS4 sharing options (and others) and social media stuff is nice to have, it never bridges the gap (for me) between gaming and making friends. Discord is the only thing where people tend to get together, around a subject, and sometimes play together, but it still pales in comparison to the in-game relationships i used to see back in the day.
---
People loved this game because of the effect it had, among other reasons, and will keep coming back for it.
---
I think we should look at it a bit different way.
---
It's a cycle. The great cycle of life, of birth and death. Everything gets reborn, when the time comes.
---
Even you and me.
---
Hooray for Druid: instant upgrade of armor to plate-equivalent levels with Dire Bear form and without having to replace a single thing.
---
How will warriors handle pvp when everyone is in MC gear? Will they basically be a free HK? I know they are gear dependent, but what happens when everyone has the same low level gear? I'm thinking of going warrior because tanking would make for quick groups and sitting around for hours trying to find a group isn't a luxury I'll have this time around.
---
If every person in the raid had the arcanite dragonling and used them one after the other, you still wouldn't have full uptime.
---
&gt; Leveling weapons skills sucks, especially if you never use it for any other weapon again
---
It's honestly fairly easy and quick to get your weapon skill up to ~200 with hamstring spam on low 30s then low 40s mobs when you pick up Resurgence Rod.
---
That said Beastslayer is best if you spec'd into Axe spec already.
---
My first character was a nightelf named Burbadorf. This takes me wayyy back.
---
But it's funny tho
---
Spicy... could be interesting on launch.
---
No you have the concept wrong. Time is relative. For the person travelling time is constant. Time is also constant for the person not moving. But if the person not moving observes the person moving then it appears to them that time is moving slower for the person who is moving. 
---
TLDR - time is perspective, constant from your own perspective, changes for people outside you perspective.
---
If only they had only more pixels.
---
They completely change the feel of them.
---
But how boring to play. The Druid was the only cure for my altaholism. Stealthing healer FTW!
---
Yeah, they both had Titanforging.
---
Can't put a campfire over another.
---
Wow, that actually looks really nice.  I dont play many humans, and normally have a helm on (well, i guess not on my female pally, but my low level male warlock does), so i guess i never really see that.
---
I love the newer Dwarf/DI Dwarf models, though.
---
Vurtne was a male Undead.
---
If you roll a none standard spec there is guilds that allow that.  
---
If you roll that way expect to work harder for your slot.  Pots/ enchants etc to reach better stats.  Also where in the raid your put will make a difference. 
---
Balance druids with characters who gain benefit from spell crit etc.
---
Using an addon like Auctioneer - it could scan the AH to compile data on all prices so you knew how much you could sell stuff for. But the scan took 5-10 minutes (standing at the auctionner in the AH) depending on how much stuff was on at the time.
---
I agree, Cataclysm was kinda like WoW 2.0. Mostly in terms of that seems like the natural break of old wow and newer wow. That or after Pandaria.
---
but there are quite little class abilities that give you a DoT in full meaning. Most that damage the player, give either single-time damage, or channel.
---
And, that trinket works on every single class.
---
Uhm, warriors dont stand a chance agsinst any hunter who knows what he is doing.
---
Im not all that sure, but I think Shazzraz had a lot of arcane resistance or maybe even immunity to it. I dont think any other boss had any. The problem is that even if one boss is immune to arcane, you are gonna be useless at that boss, due to no dualspecc or even respeccing.
---
Pretty sure most bosses was completely immune to fire dmg tho, which is the reason everyone played frost, as it was the only effective specc in all raids.
---
My absolute favorite weapon of all time is Corrupted Ashbringer.
---
dwarf hunter for lets say solo play leveling and exploring WoW
---
turned out for gryhard pvp as restokin druid and slsl wlock on tbc that went into wotlk arenas too, quit when wow was destoryed by Cataflying and moved to private realms with arena-tournaments
---
this time i will be rolling a druid, probably a hyperhybrid build to try the skillscap on 60s with dudu combos to rekt 1v1 w/ engi n vanilla cheats
---
Will go rogue as well, but as an alt. Me and a friend will lvl up duo rogue. Can't wait until we get to STV and further on dem bad bois.
---
People were too hung up on “ermgee kung-fu pandaz” to really pay attention to everything else. And then SoO got extended.
---
I too, felt that way. Looking back on it i realize that'd be like finding a nazi tabbard IRL and running around wearing it.
---
If you are looking for alternative Mage PVP videos I recommend these 2 guys. Both are pretty good and play different specs.
---
Vurtne - Frost Mage PVP - Search "Vurtne" on Youtube
---
Otherguy - Fire Mage PVP - Search "Sorrow Hill Otherguy" on Youtube
---
That talent is not usually in a prot build, there just aren't enough points to justify it. There are too many better talents in that range. 
---
For example, as a standard tank build you need:
---
Last stand (requires 2/2 imp bloodrage)
---
1 point imp shield block (requires 5/5 shield specialization)
---
5/5 defiance
---
5/5 tactical mastery (requires 5 points in arms)
---
Your talent build should look something like this:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LchxzhbZcZxizsg0zVo
---
A few of those are optional:
---
You can swap 3/5 parry for 3/3 imp heroic strike
---
You can swap 3/3 imp revenge and 2/3 imp sunder armor for either anticipation or imp shield wall.
---
Note that it takes about 8 points of defense to equal 1% dodge or parry, not counting the crit immunity from defense.
---
I normally play a Warlock, though in Retail from when i started in Wrath-now ive (at various times) mained....
---
Warlock, Rogue (DS for the daggers, guild didnt have one), Monk (shortly, hate em now), Pally...and have had a strong showing from DK (many moons ago), Druid, and to an extent Priest alts.
---
Im going Priest in Classic.  Largely because i want to play a Dwarf, and its the class i want to play the most that Dwarves can be.  Also because i dont want to be a soul shard bitch.
---
Sometimes i think about making a Pally, but i think that'll be an eventual alt (along with a lock)
---
Argent Tournament was exactly when I quit. A shame after one of the greatest raids ever made in Ulduar.
---
If you buy the charms and get help from a higher level character to kill Cyclonian then can you still consider it's a "fresh server" leveling scenario? You're basically getting boosted, it's very different from being in the first wave of 30s-40s and fending for yourself, in which case WW axe is a no-go for most experienced warriors.
---
It's probably more like level 47 or so before you would hit exalted.  The best strategy is yes to do the quests that give Darnassus rep at the level range they are made for...so obviously doing all of the Night Elf quests starting at level 1 or 2 is ideal, then follow the leveling path Night Elves would.
---
Main key is to do the quests while you are in the level range of the quest to get the most rep.  If you go back at level 60 and do them you'll only get like 20% of the rep compared to if you were at that level range.
---
I instantly get chills whenever I listen to this.   
---
Probably one of my favourite pieces of music ever at this point just because of the emotional attachment I have to it.
---
I had a boss who left his final fantasy 14 subscription on for like 2 years without playing. He knew it was on he just...... never got around to turning it off.
---
I'm sure that people like him represent a very small percentage of the overall picture, but they're out there..... giving free money to blizzard/squareenix.
---
Ah yes, Skull of Impending Doom is probably the most common. Also gives you a movement speed boost.
---
noone serious pvps as memehancer. the spec dies with lvl 59.
---
Had to level my bank toon to 20 to stop this from happening.  No matter how many times I and other people reported this griefing, Blizz would never do nothing about it.
---
Played on PS and the admins were quick to shut it down and warn/ban players who did this.
---
Still an asshole move.
---
I’m also going rogue as an alt because it’s the character I’ve loved for so long.. using him also as a duo leveler but my friend hasn’t made up his mind what class he wants yet lol
---
People still don't understand that given Blizzard drop rate and everybody needing the same items, prebis only happen in the wild dreams of the spreadsheet maniacs.
---
You'd better enter MC in whatever gear week 2 after release than wait 6 weeks and still have holes in your pre-bis.
---
True Vanilla story : I got recruted in a HC guild at lvl 58 because someone vouched for me.
---
Few days later I dinged 60 with them in Strat UD, they said "Ok this evening you can do MC".
---
First MC run on my fresh 60 warrior I got the T1 legs to replace my crappy "of the asthmatic bear" legs. 
---
Felt good.
---
That’s exactly what I thought of when I started reading the post!
---
He was the unexperienced dude that only recently dealt with his complexes about his father fucking up his race. He was taught by the Saurfang about the honor and was showing decent character qualities during Cataclysm zone storylines like his reaction to the Sylvana's actions in Silverpine, his intervention in the Stone Talon and it was just cool to have him leading the assault on the Twilight Highlands.
---
The only QOL change I would want is guild banks. Would prevent account sharing or having to wait for the GM to log on to get something out of the guild bank.  Only QOL change that is viable.
---
Same thing for me, except the oposite....so...
---
I’m not playing 12-16 hours a day, so 1-30 is probably going to take me a week. Still a fresh server by that measure. If you want to be one of the first 30s on the server, better strap in to your desk and take 2 weeks off work.
---
Mainly just a more traditional search/filter UI similar to wowhead &amp; classicdb.
---
Also would like to display the values of stats that you specifically queried for alongside the ilvl and required level values in a column.
---
As well as clickable ascending/descending sorting for all columns.
---
Mostly just UI &amp; quality of life improvements, not really any major additions I can think of.
---
Really the only expansion where they pulled something out of their ass is WoD with the time travel bullshit. 
---
Vanilla was obviously based in WoW/WC3
---
TBC was mostly based on established lore in WoW/TBC with outland, blood elves, Illidan, and the Burning Legion, even if they did fuck that lore up.
---
WotLK was obviously based on established Warcraft lore.
---
Cata I believe was dealing with established Warcraft lore as Deathwing wasn't just pulled out of their ass.
---
Pandas had one lore significant character that I can remember in all of warcraft before MoP. They kinda just pulled Pandaria out of their ass, really.
---
WoD was fucked
---
Legion was based on the Burning Legion which is obviously established warcraft lore.
---
And BFA with Kul Tiras and Zandalar is based on established Warcraft lore.
---
so so far, MoP was probably the one where Blizzard pulled the second most things out of their ass.
---
A rogue names hamburglar
---
Well it's either human or dwarf for paladins and I don't really want to be a dwarf so...
---
How come BC isn't on this...one of the best expansions.
---
Please do not actually try to level as a healing spec. If you are a priest and you play shadow you will pvp just fine, most people will completely avoid you if they see you in shadowform and full mana and if they don't you can 1v1 them easily. 
---
Healing classes all pvp fine while leveling and even out 1v1 damage classes alot of the time, for instance as a shaman you can kite a warrior forever.
---
And gouge!
---
This. Just adding into it but leveling is a breeze, which means farming is a breeze. You scale really well with gear, mages will consistently compete with rogues and later on with warriors for top dps. In PvP mages are gods, great burst, great cc, they counter warriors which will be the most popular class. In 5 man dungeons at the start people will take mages over other classes because sheep is so strong, plus food is always good. And tunes for portals can be expensive, but people pay for ports all the time.
---
Whats even weirder is that human males have two general hair vibes. Anime and amish. Where is the inbetween!?
---
Do you want a less streamlined early leveling experience with more travel between zones and harder access to a lot of instances before level 40 or do you want to set your HS to Kargath at 60?
---
The no life stuff is tied to raid preparation, namely farming consumables. And warriors in general are really bad at farming.
---
It's me. The innocent poor Bulgarian boy. Gib moni pls.
---
It depends. Armor is huge in PvP and most classes do tank NPCs at level 40. Obviously ignore it as mage, hunter or warlock but even for priests it is pretty noticeable because of how well it synergizes with PW Shield. Dropping inner fire tends to explode the incoming damage in many situations.
---
Their back-up concept: A previously unknown race of elves that look kinda asian.
---
ya, i understand, if one boss is immune then theres no reason to use that spec cause you'd have to awkwardly shuffle in and out, which wouldn't work very well since how deep the dungeons are.
---
Honestly it wasn’t. It was focused around Beast Mastery (Beastmasters). In the sense of a BM spec, the epic pieces were legitimately good, with giving measurable benefits to the pet while engaged. 
---
Boots: 3% pet damage
---
Helm: 1% hit, 3% pet health
---
Gloves: 2% pet crit
---
Chest: 10% pet armor, 1% crit
---
4pc bonus was: 4% chance on ranged attack to restore 200 mana.
---
Yeah, but JOHN FUCKING MADDEN
---
:P
---
The only DPS i really put any effort into on Retail is my Destro Lock.  Its not really a difficult rotation, but if you fuck up at the wrong time your DPS is fucked for the fight (or annoyingly, if you have to move.  WAY too much of our damage comes in a 25s window.  Youre hitting with a wet noodle for the other 2.5 mins).
---
Sometimes i miss the simplicity of Wrath Destro (when i started).  It wasnt a fancy spec, and lack of CDs kinda stunk, but it was so smooth.
---
"Existing" is a stretch.  There was only one pandaren in all of warcraft lore, and he was mostly intended as a joke.
---
Boy you really narrowed it down huh.
---
Are you me?  Quite literally my exact current resume
---
https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Ripple-centralized 
---
here are some sensible answers and some ripple shills lying. 
---
sanjeev is right about ripple not being as decentralized as btc.
---
Good troll, I laughed.
---
Depends on your spec and gear. If you're in blues with a decent weapon and arms spec, you'll hit pretty hard. As a warrior, you're ALWAYS better off in group PvP. In group PvP with a healer, you are absolutely NOT a free HK.  Out in the world grinding mobs and getting your freak on with a mage....bad news bud.
---
&gt;Did you read my comment above?  
---
&gt; And theres no way blizzard doesn't add the regular achievements with just the statistics tab 
---
Confusing as fuck. You made a double negative. If there's no way blizzard DOESN'T add the regular achievements, then that would imply they are adding the achievemenets, hence his confusion due to your poor grammar.
---
The 'War' comes on....
---
Definitely Thunderfury. Gotta get those bindings.
---
More like people hated MoP when it was announced, the people who actually played it enjoyed it, and the people who came back for Warlords learned that people enjoyed it by that point.
---
Last I checked:(Correct me if I'm wrong, naturally)
---
&gt;rockbiter/earthbind was found to level pretty well, saves alot of healing downtime. Essentially a hamstring kiting analogue for shamans
---
&gt;Shamans are well known for having an acceptable hybrid elemental/resto spec that works well for PVP and PVE
---
 I doubt the toxic vets will be abundant. The devs are leaving things like this up to the community. Run into an asshole rogue who shits on the group the whole time. Let friends or guild know. They'll get their own reputation.
---
 I also think there will be more casual and nice players than tryhard min/maxers who shit on new players.
---
Most pre bis are bis until bwl if not later. And with the raid lockout and raid loot scarcity you are more likely to get your pre bis first even if better loot exist in MC anyway.
---
Death Knight.
---
Still, is 60$ a legit wage in Bulgaria?
---
I'd rather believe it was unemployment benefits, pocket money, or part time job, uber, or something like that. East Europe but still Europe. 
---
It just can't be a full time job. It would be $0.5 per hour - even "earn by clicking ads" sites pay more.
---
I played like three priests on private servers and I played them pretty well. This time I am heading for a warrior because they are super dynamic to play and a good tank goes a long way.
---
MoP was pretty good. WoD was even okay in hindsight. Legion was, as I saw someone else put it, the beginning if WoW2, and WoW2 sucks. The endless grind for "special points" where the bar is constantly moved, and you just have to grind grind grind for your special points in content you couldn't give a shit about.
---
I'm also thinking about shaman or druid. What do you think?
---
There is no reason it would not work on Classic
---
Why not paladin?
---
Watched a great video about spirit and how a warrior should use staffs while leveling so they don’t have to eat as often.
---
You could still spam frostbolt on those bosses, sub par damage but not useles. Also mages switch to fire spec once AQ comes out and especially in Naxx. So frost half the game, fire half the game.
---
Sound advice. Thanks!
---
Hunter.
---
BC talents after Naxx like a year later. Technically they were in vanilla.
---
This isn't exactly a bad thing depending on how you look at it.
---
Having a faction leader be the boss and a faction city be the raid environment is actually such a cool idea though.
---
Some people will rage after a wipe, others won't. There isn't much to talk about here. Get up and try again. Ignore flaming (unless you like counter flaming) and try to learn from your mistakes and other people's suggestions.
---
You mean non-optimal. Honestly, play what you like and tryhard...try as hard as you can, be the best player you can, take every advantage you can whether flasking, consumes, engineering tricks, whatever and things will work out for you even if you're not a Grade A class/spec.
---
We're seeing so many new 'what should I play' post each day. Maybe rather than everyone asking they should go read some of the older post. 
---
I'm sure they'll be plenty of answers to any questions you might have regarding a specific class. 
---
Play what you want - if you don't know, then try the different classes.
---
I got BFA for my birthday...

thanks, Blizz.

This is gonna sound like a huge troll but last night I had a dream that I ran into a dude that was wearing the arathi tabard and was talking to them about classic.  I guess it’s safe to say I’ve absorbed all things Classic into my psyche.  Great pic.
---
&gt; complexes about his father fucking up his race  
---
His father saved his race, not fucked it up.
---
Mage
---
Beats: Warrior, Paladin, usually Druid
---
Loses: Priest, Warlock, Shaman
---
Even: Hunter, Rogue (depends on skills levels and who gets the jump on the other person.)
---
Hmm, paladin sounds interesting also...
---
I still (and frequently) see all the goofs you mentioned on private servers.  
---
Any veteran that expects every new or retail player to immediately know everything about Classic is entirely missing the point. A year after Vanilla's launch groups would still get lost in BRD or ST. Classic was a learning experience, and some of the best social aspects of the community were built around learning the game together. Veterans should be helping the newbies learn the ropes of Vanilla.
---
Have they had an expansion where only a single race was introduced besides Mists? Let’s also not forget that Outland had plot points from Warcraft 2 and 3 to focus on too. Pandaria did not.

If you keep your wand up to date, priests are actually great levelers.
---
Their damage output is mediocre, but if you do it right there is zero drinking in between mobs. On top of that you're everyone's favorite healer during the leveling process, so fnding dungeon groups will be very easy.
---
I was NE priest healer and rolling a rogue this time as main.
---
As a priest you aint gonna get a billion whispers for fortitude m8, in fact, being the priest is one of the easiest jobs buffing, just dont forget your mats for the buff and pop it once per raid wipe :)
---
Just know that if you roll a dps you aint gonna get so wanted as being a healer. A healer really opens doors faster to raid guilds etc.
---
Legion and MOP were both great expansions.   Legion is my favorite WoW has been since Vanilla.
---
Some people may feel an over saturation of asian themes if they ya, for some reason play Korean MMOs, but I bet lets of people feel the same about the Western Medieval/High Fantasy saturation of most Western games. So I find the idea of this being "over saturated" a bit subjective. It had a strong theme that stayed consistent, something that some other expansions lacked. It felt like a cohesive space, instead of a hodge podge of random ideas.
---
I think you misunderstand who is who here.
---
Actually there is. It did not work in the Classic demo client. The improved AI and pathing of mobs in the modern client make them a lot more reactive and faster to follow you and adapt to sudden changes of direction, which results in you taking a lot more hits because you can't make as much distance between you and the mob inbetween swings.
---
There is a zero % chance you solo'd the WW axe quest at 33 lmao, maybe in wrath.
---
"I'm creepin' around right now"
---
Then why was Chen being at the founding of Orgrimmar canon? Or why was [Chen’s empty cask] a thing?
---
I've heard of it, but we didn't know about it in vanilla, so I'm not sure if its a pserver thing or not. All the guilds on my server farmed NR gear.
---
Your better off just throwing out shields and keeping the improved ve switching and healing is just terrible you’ll go oom and be worthless
---
&gt;when tanks dont know where to go in certain dungeons
---
yes, but the other ones no. Vanilla isn't hard and low dps isn't really possible if you just use your abilities. 
---
But if you like, break sheeps, ninja pull stuff or don't bring water as a healer people could get pretty mad.
---
Just join a guild, join the discord when you play and talk to people, someone will know what to do and gladly teach you if you're willing to listen. The only reason to reject people is too big an ego. The game is pretty easy, you don't have to be amazing to play. Just show up, be a nice normal person and people will be happy to spend time with you.
---
And if someone super hardcore rages at you /ignore (playername) them
---
For people that haven't played rogue in vanilla but have in retail, you're in for a surprise! Your CDs are long, DoTs will ruin your day because you don't have CoS, and you're a god 1v1 and just support in group PvP...and if you try to stealth up on mobs in vanilla the way you do in retail, the mob is going to see you and pull you out of stealth, even with MoD...and you move verrrrrrrrrrrrrry slowwwwwwwwwwwwwwly.  It's A LOT different. Faerie fire = fucked.
---
no. There was something with "berserk" or "battlerage" or something like that, in name. It was dealing damage in %'s of your health, and I think it increased crit chance or attack speed.

Ah I miss pre WotLK where you could go from one zone which is a lush, green forest to another zone that's red mountains or a dark, halloween themed zone. I'm sorry for the horde though which had brownish/red clay durotar and brown barrens, and brownish/red barren thousand needles, and brownish/red mountains with patches of green.
---
or if you had a strong enough gravitational pull. This would have the same effect without the speed. Talking block hole levels of gravity here
---
As a hunter, if I see a warrior alone that is a free HK.
---
Doing it well is a science but doing it slowly is pretty easy. A great priest will optimize damage per mana significantly. A good priest can almost always fight 2-3 mobs at once at the cost of having to drink afterwards.
---
A lot of people have horrible rotations (even here the bubble, mb, swp, wand rotation is horribly inefficient and slow). A great priest can do 3 mobs per minute and sustain mana. Most can be happy to push it to two.
---
In some scenarios you can even spread dots on many mobs and get to the next level but that is mostly for farming and not for leveling.
---
Disc is very underrated (holy fire and smites). Shadow form is horribly overrated. It’s pretty bad at level 40. It takes level 46 to even break even. Mind flay is also bad until it hits level 3-5.
---
Pro-tip: Downrank your shields. Almost nobody does.
---
False.
---
I guess you give up then, because whether you personally include PvP in the original post or not, I do, and my comment was about mage CC "Against a Druid", meaning PvP.
---
For example, is mage CC the best AGAINST A DRUID? No, because Druids can counter it. Rogues however have hard stuns, blind, sap. Possibly the best "Against a druid". 
---
However many times you repeat yourself, it doesn't change that my comment was in regards to crowd control, in a PvP situation, versus a druid. My comment was "Who is able to literally beat a mage"
---
Ok, where was that posted?
---
Sure, I think the harder problem will be if you have looted decent swords in raids and other people need gear, they're gonna say "you're the sword guy" and give the dagger to another raider. It's not a foregone conclusion, but I would carefully choose your path before even starting to raid because loot isn't as easy to come by especially for rogues.
---
You're guaranteed all the raid slots you want if you roll Balance druid.
---
Okay, so you don't think all the races look dumb? Yet you state it as a reason not to play shaman?
---
HUH?
---
I had to google it and was met with some dude called "Harlan Sweete" which looks like a villain out of Lazy Town. They sure went astray with the character in this game.
---
Majority of bitcoin is mined in China though? That could cause a 51% with the right money which I’m sure is pocket change to those people

---
It is 0.12% to hit.
---
Hunter and druid would be awesome so they can keep up with you.
---
Yes Chen is the one panda I'm talking about.
---
&gt; If you like grinding alone most of the time, it's a horrible pick. You need a healer with you to do anything and that matters way more than gear.
---
Not true at all. Just learn how to play the class properly.
---
Apparently people do not know that Pandaren existed way before Kung fu Panda was a thing.
---
https://i.imgur.com/z482Xwi.jpg
---
Not an excuse still IMO. They could make more shit like this Lizardman culture or more focus on Yaungols, more Zandalari trolls from the start, not from 5.2
---
Thanks for your valuable contribution
---
What you have to account for is that group pvp is often more important and that the dynamics are way different.
---
For example, assuming good gear and skill, a warrior won't really beat any class in 1v1, but give them a good healer and suddenly they can 2v5 anything.
---
Depends on the scale of time dilation. Experiments have been done with atomic clocks showing time dilation.
---
Syncing the clocks then keeping one on the ground and fly the other around.
---
When the flying clock was returned they were out of sync, the flying one being behind the static one. This of course is minuscule levels, but solid examples none the less. 
---
Travel at the speed of light is a 2d world, does not make sense to us with our current level of knowledge. We know that's how it is, but cannot contemplate it properly because time ceases to exist at that speed.
---
Imo no. MoP looked gorgeous and the story was fine. Fight the other faction, get fucked up, find out that negative emotions feed the remnants of Ysharaj, have old god spawn called the sha start popping up because of you, destroying and corrupting beautiful lands like the vale and jadesong. Find out the pandaren has a secret police force for ages trying to force everyone to be happy or drunk to stop the sha from awakening. Work with them. Find out about a new insect race that serves the old gods. Cause the secret police to be corrupted by the Sha of Pride, go in to free their dead and kill any corrupted, save taran zhu. Then Garrosh gets sick of Voljins shit and steals the heart of Ysharaj and almost kills zhu. Que SoO. 
---
Way better imo then most of wows storylines. 
---
Also classes were insanely fun at MoP.
---
Especially warlock. Not joking when I say most warlocks want our class from MoP back. The class designer worked with the community on it.  And in WoD the community and class designer were pushing back against blizzard fucking with warlock. To the point that the class designer told blizzard that changing warlock was a bad idea and got fired for it.
---
And it WAS a bad idea. They needed life support for the first chunk of WoD and haven’t felt good sense. Warlocks haven’t tanked anything since and warlocks are in a bad spot design wise now where the dot class is ST burst, destro just waits for anti heal and 1 shots and demo just keeps throwing around demons that people ignore.
---
Hell warlocks at the beginning of legion were on life support too.
---
And this expansion, instead, they were one top DPS on fight with affliction ST.
---
\_tv in your name means you're a streamer right ? Show us !
---
They're keeping it as close as possible to how it was back then. So no, no "balancing"
---
Nice troll, give druids a rez like priest and pallies? that aint a QoL change lol, thats game changing, think before you post pls.
---
Pretty sure you just live in a bubble.
---
Shadow Priest is pretty good leveling speed, but feral is better.
---
Yeah but at the time the sad state warlocks were in. F for respect
---
He thought his father fucked it up and during Nagrand questline, Thrall tells him about the real story.
---
Yeah but srsly if you want to play and can´t afford it due to subscription - I believe there is a lot of people happy to help you out there! We were all young once ;)  
---
Just be honest pls (which I believe you have been!) :)
---
That sounds like an AWESOME GROUP!!! Who would say terrible??  Mage with portals, food, water, awesome CC and damage, holy paladin for BoP, heals, MP5 you guys will EASILY be able to get a tank. "Hi, LF1M Tank, we can summon you! Have heals and mage!"  I'd be all over that shit.
---
No.  Spell resistance only goes one way; it doesn't really go negative.  IIRC, there are some mobs that are vulnerable to specific schools of magic, but those are because of specific (de)buffs and not a function of spell resistance.  They're the exception rather than the rule.
---
Mages specced Frost for MC because of widespread resistance/immunity to Fire, not because Frost had any special advantage.
---
Yeah, but AQ wont be out for a long time, every mage was frost for MC and bwl back in the day. Maybe it will be different this time around, maybe arcane will work if it really only is 1 boss that is immune.
---
True but.. how wrong?  If they are 95% correct versus 10% correct that's a huge difference.
---
I kinda did the same, but it was at the second spawn point and not the first. I was very lucky.
---
 I also believe that if you suck and get kicked, you are stuck in a raid lockout for 7 days. I don't know if it is after one boss kill or after entering the instance.
---
My bad about earlier, tone is impossible to tell.
---
I'm a poor Bulgarian boy, can you send me money?
---
Well he was the first orc to join the demonic pact but if it wasn't him then it woulda been someone else, idk.  You have a point.
---
That's why you hop in direct path backwards like seen on some speedruns
---
Spirit warriors are just a meme though. Some people started talking about it as a joke and now people actually believe it's a real thing.
---
The logic is that by having a set with spirit as you run between mobs you will regen more hp and reduce downtime. That in itself is reasonable.
---
The issue is that not only do you need to carry a full set of gear with you in your bags, which means more trips back to the vendor when your bags are full, but you also risk getting attacked by mobs or players while wearing your spirit set which most likely results in a corpserun back from the graveyard.
---
It's simply not worth doing the spirit build when you can achieve the same result by just waitng for another tic on your magefood and not be free honorable kill in the meantime.
---
My sides
---
because i'm replying to someone. Do you know how when you open the achievements menue they'res that little tab on the bottom that says statistics? I'm saying blizzard cannot add that without also adding the rest of the menu, which they will not do. They won't do X and also not do Y. I'm discussing 2 different things related to the same topic. I am saying no the individual thing AND no to the entire topic. I don't know how you would word that without saying no twice. Other than saying object X is related but not the same as object Y. I'm sorry I assumed people would know there are 2 tabs in the menu, but If you quit before Wrath I guess you've never seen it, but I have no idea what would make you want to comment about it, i'm sure theres a wowhead video somewhere explaining how to use it and what it does.
---
Don't forget Rogues.
---
well, it is the country considered "the hardest to get a working visa"
---
Bloodrage deals about 5% of your health in damage and gives you some rage. It's usually what warriors pop before engaging. 
---
Berserker Rage is a 30 second cooldown that makes you immune to fear for 10 seconds and generating extra rage. 
---
Death Wish increases your damage by 20% but reduces your armour and resistances by 20% for 30 seconds. Also makes you immune to fear.
---
Just because Warcraft is based on Warhammer lore doesn't mean Warhammer is better.
---
Warhammer lore is all over the goddamn place and doesn't make any sense. ESPECIALLY Warhammer 40K. But that's my opinion. I am very glad that you enjoy the lore - just not for me.
---
Storm wind - Jason Hayes 
---
Takes me every time even though I’m a horse player
---
Because people think that Blizzard stole things from Kung Fu Panda, which came a long timer -after- the first Pandaren turned up.
---
Or they moan about Blizzard pulling Lore out of their ass, which happens in almost every expansion yet you don't hear them whining about that.
---
We don’t need blizzard to intervene in these matters. Waste of time. Should actually be warned/banned for reporting this, wasting resources.. Got to love them snowflakes.
---
No "more prosperious countries" will force a person to burn through their savings due to sickness. Except one.
---
If it is only that one boss, it wont be too much of a problem as you still have frost spells and there are no enrage timers. If you make up for it on the harder bosses it could be worth it. But i honestly dont know if arcane is bad on other bosses, people werent that smart back then, so if 1 boss was immune it was just a no go.
---
Did you even read the post? He's talking about how shit modern wow's class balance is due to pruning and homoginization and how they need to look back to vanilla.
---
I'll never understand the hate for pandas, in a world of giant cow men, green midgets or regular midgets (both of which make mechs) somehow those are acceptable but pandas are over the line?
---
I didn't play Asian MMOs at all, but I just not a fan of Asian(mostly Chinese here) culture/myths in the first place and I also like "a hodgepodge of random ideas" throughout the expansion with a strong focus on something per big patch.
---
Arcane missiles are actually shit in vanilla. They fixed it in tbc but you can read on why no one uses it. It sucks to have a whole arcane tree for fire and frost.  It's a great pvp finisher though.
---
I played a lot of classes in vanilla but my main was a night elf priest.  I've been a priest since.  I'll be going night elf hunter this go around.  With less time I'm looking forward to the fun leveling, pet fantasy and insanely high pvp skill ceiling.  I'm a r1/multigladiator on live so I'm hoping to just roll over 90% of the player base with pvp skill and I think hunter will be the most fun for it (kiting, range, lots of tools).  I look forward to spamming bgs on a fun class with a high skill ceiling and no tedious things to do like make people water, shards, ports etc.  I guess managing your pet can be a micro game but its kinda fun when you have one pet that you feel attached to
---
The elven chants always get me... reminds me of running around teldrassil on my numerous alts which never got over level 6
---

---
I did not watch the video. But that‘s just wrong. Mind flay does about 2 dpm and gets more efficient as you rank it up. Mind blast does about 1.2 or so dpm.
---
You don’t need fancy graphs to divide a damage value by a mana cost.
---
Holy fire is probably the most efficient spell at all times.
---
SWP is usually also bad because ideally you kill mobs before the fourth and fifth tick.
---
Shit you right
---
Oh I see what you mean.  Good point.
---
I saw more people like MoP than hate. Infact I saw more hate for WoD and BFA. Most of the hate  for MoP seemed to be from people not playing, who didn’t give the expansion a chance or like tried it quickly before they got the stuff that made classes crazy and before the storyline even really started. Even then we knew classes felt amazing compared to previously, especially warlock. Hell warlock was so fun that when they tried to gut it, the class designer and warlock community tried to argue with blizzard to leave it alone, and the class designer got fired for it. 
---
And warlocks still want that class design back.
---
100%. Its so good for nose defending
---
He isnt. 60$ isnt a legit monthly wage for full time work in bulgaria
---
dual wield tanks are alot stronger horde side with windfury.
---
MoP has better titanforging. You could buy it and it was capped.
---
That's awesome of you! Hell now that I know I would join in ;D
---
I can totally feel what this must be like - everyone was Young and broke once :P But never too broke to get ganked the shit out of in STV.... 
---
Must be terrible...
---
Very good work OP!
---
I did read the post.  I interpreted it differently.  We are on a classic wow subreddit and I assumed we wouldnt be talking about retail.  Context matters.
---
People come to Gurubashi arena to 2v2 and 3v3. Spectators bet with each other on who wins.
---
It is a reason you may not what to play shaman. It may bother you it may not. 
---
...It does not bother me, as i stated above.
---
Being lactose intolerant is a reason to not eat ice cream. I am not lactose intolerant but if I was, I would not eat ice cream.
---
Staffs until like you get your lvl 30 wirl wind axe have the same DPS and always slow or really slow AS, so they're strong warrior weapons. They can have a lot of spirit.
---
At lvl 20 there's a 12+ spirit staff that drops in WC, really good weapon for a few lvls.
---
Don’t grab shadow form at 40. Mind flay needs a higher rank to keep up with disc and you don’t want to get rid of the wand spec.
---
It might feel better at first (though frankly it doesn’t) but you will have to drink a lot at those levels.
---
Try to stay holy/disc hybrid until level 46.
---
What? WH40K lore is all over the place? sounds like you never bothered to look into it really well or read any of the books. It shits all over WoW's lore and storytelling I can tell you that much.
---
&gt;Or why was [Chen’s empty cask] a thing?
---
It's a reference, I guess, to the Warcraft 3. Like Pylons in Un'goro is the reference to the Starcraft.
---
My undead priest's jaw would have just dropped if he had one.
---
I think he meant that paladins are so much better than priests at PvP healing
---
Narrowed it down haha
---
&gt;TBC was mostly based on established lore in WoW/TBC with outland, blood elves, Illidan, and the Burning Legion, even if they did fuck that lore up.
---
They pulled out of their asses Draenei lore and retconned some Pantheon/Burning Legion lore.
---
Not only your opinion but it's a fact, they just were lol
---
I think Classic will be a success and it'll cause retail to go back into being more of a true RPG rather than a raiding simulation with constant and easy kicks off "You're awesome and get what ever you want without effort!"
---
Retail now is a like a facebook game =/ I still enjoy playing it with my GF now and then but I would never play it as much as I'll play classic.
---
to 0.5% hp yea that would bring them quite low
---
In demand: Priest, Shaman, Paladin, Warrior  
---
Low on demand: Druid, Hunter, Rogue
---
No. HotW is your best bet for that sort of thing.
---
But that doesn’t mean it’s bad like everyone claims, it just means you didn’t like the theme.
---
Also legion was basically Night Elves .exe
---
Nearly everything in some manner was about night elves or looped back to night elves. Even high mountain had quests about night elves. Like Huln working with Jarod and Malfurion to fight the legion.
---
Even Suramar was night elf shit, since they all were night elves and that city is tarandes old home.
---
What kind of druids are you facing?? Mages are my favorite target on my druid, besides maybe rogues.
---
Im sure eventually it will be a bit annoying but initially I’ll probably have to relearn the difficulty curve.  Game is very different than when I played in 2004.  No one likes to feel like their time is being wasted but if they were really worried they should start a private group of friends and not pug stuff.
---
I will play one of the classes.
---
I remember them not being too difficult usually. But it was a loooong time ago. Maybe they were just bad.
---
Yeah, Warlocks are great in the patch WoW Classic will be released in.  But in the start they were like sad mages. So sad and lonley they summoned demons that did nothing worthwile.
---
My understanding that the way to level is to respec for Shadow Form at 40, and put your next 5 points into wands.
---
Druids are fine as they are in Vanilla.
---
Jack of all trades, master of none and it should remain like that.
---
I didn't know that Chris Griffin is so excited for WoW: Classic.
---
Yeah, but you would never call it that unless you played one of those expansions from the past decade that I'm not going to name.
---
Legion was all about demon hunters xD it may not be a race but the entire expac was about killing demons lmao
---
We weren’t labeled as bad guys, we were along side Voljin openly rebelling. Also most hordies I know found the idea of raiding orgrimmar and exploring the areas we can’t reach to be cool.
---
Warrior is fine but the hardest to level and the most expensive to gear up. It’s not “efficient” but definitely viable.
---
Warriors also make or break every group tbh.
---
Suramar was mostly about Highborn (Nightelves are Tree humpers and Elune praisers). But I also didn't like most things about Legion zones outside of Suramar and I agree with you. Valshara was meh, Aszuna was trash, Highmountain was okay, Some parts of Stroheim was good, some was bad, but the Suramar was probably the best location since Forstfire Ridge.
---
It was colorful till you played the game. Shortly after things become black, white and grey in areas because of the old gods.
---
Millenial.
---
At 60 - Pally on a PvP server, Priest on a PvE server.
---
During 1-59 leveling, priest is going to be amazing in every way especially shadow at 40 if you let the priest get the killing blow for spirit tap to proc. You guys won't have any down time and won't compete for gear.
---
Pally would be fine too, I just think priest would be less down time and easier as far as splitting up loot.
---
As a vet, who also played on a P server for a couple of years, I can say I will have no problem helping explain a dungeon before we start.  I'll probably roll a warrior, druid, or paladin, so I'm not too worried about the tank or healing part.  I think the responsibility falls more on the Vet to explain how things work.  If you go into a 40 man raid the person leading should be the one to explain all the pulls and boss fights, you don't just expect everyone to know everything.  I would say the same works for 5-10 man dungeons.
---
I had a few solid rogues start reflecting my traps on me to counter this on a p server. Made me switch to explosive trap if I saw certain names (then fd/immo trap). Actuslly worked pretty well with entrapment and clever traps. Not bad magic damage, and roots the fuck out of people.
---
The old models and animations will always be used. The option is for old vs new lightning/shadows/water effects.
---
I finished mine in early TBC
---
by far, druid is only 2nd to hunter in terms of leveling speed.
---
Linken's Adventure.  Un'Goro Crater.  Gotta have that boomerang.
---
If you're trying to decide which class to play, I'd recommend also accounting for how well each class will be represented compared against how easily the class justifies a raid spot in a vacuum.  Mages and priests will be in high demand, but will also have very high representation for the same reason they'll be in demand: they're high-performing classes, and everyone knows it.
---
Warlocks, especially Alliance-side, will become more desirable as guilds begin attempting more difficult content (e.g. AQ and Naxx) due to how well they scale with gear.  Alliance warlocks will be slightly less common than Horde warlocks due to the prevalence of Will of the Forsaken, which makes Alliance warlocks significantly less powerful in PvP than their Horde counterparts.
---
I think I just mean they’re awesome healers for PvE and PvP.
---
Definitely go read about and understand the 5 second rule. That's the main thing to get because it effects HOW you heal. Also you want to use the least ranked heal spell you need and not over-heal.
---
Well highborn are Night Elves now, just nobles. Like I said, Tyrande lived there, if she was behind the wall she may very well have ended up a night borne.
---
Every class in the game except two has a mana bar. But Resto Druids have solid HoTs, Battle Rez, the most mana-efficient healing spell in the game and Innervate. The other specs have that as well but they’re still simulating other classes before being a Druid. That’s my point.
---
It's all based off our encounters. Like I legit got corpse camped in Shimmering Flats just yesterday by a war party of 5 Horde lmao.
---
Id say once Wrath introduced LFD. That was the break.
---
minimum wage is close to 300€
---
Yeah, they did pull some lore out of their asses. You are correct. TBC is probably 3rd place in the "Blizzard pulling shit out of their ass" ranking. At least they didn't pull an entire island out of their ass, though, and 99% of a race.
---
i agree. grizzly hills is the best zone blizzard ever did. there's nothing that comes close. ambience, music, art.. everything is perfect.
---
Class Discords:

Warlocks: BRING BACK MOP WARLOCK
---
Ferals are already great tanks and a lot of knowledgeable guilds use them in Naxx. They are the best meat tank for Patchwerk. Their incoming damage is higher than for warriors on average. But super steady. Some bosses like Stalagg and Feugen can leave your warrior at 100% for ten seconds straight and then obliterate them in 1-2 GCDs.
---
Top your druid off at all times and they won’t die. It’s the kind of tank you can keep up blindly by just spamming good heals.
---
I had a undead rogue, will roll orc rogue for resist. I’m actually considering having a healer alt this time around depending on how much I play. I also tanked and enjoyed that as well.
---
Rank 3 &amp; 4 are best iirc
---
MC and Onyxia attunement.
---
Ya, I'm not on the bandwagon of overall hating the new models, but there are changes I'm not a fan of. The flat-top change is a big one, my main had it and his backstory as a no-nonsense soldier was important for me. The haircut originally looked well groomed and precise, so it fit my concept. Now it looks haphazard and goofy (I mean it's already kinda goofy as a style, but now it looks like they aren't trying).
---
Yeah, my bad. But, it's not impossible to die from it. Also, it probably wastes more time having to run back from that drop, and potentially dying to mobs and getting a repair bill, than it would be to have someone kill you in Redridge a few times. 
---
Also, no one ever said to camp lowbies for hours on end. Just kill them when passing by.
---
To be honest with you, I am not holding any post MoP expansions as any sign of quality or to compare it with anything. But as someone pointed out - there is much more Night Elf-Highborne theme than Demon Hunters.
---
How is it game changing? It's not like would be usable in BGs/arenas?
---
I agree with this 100%, and I ran this spec in vanilla and always healed in raids. Hell, even in group PvP if it was a premade people mostly wanted me to heal and that was fine because I could burst someone down too if the occasion called for it. Then when I'd go solo, I'd just shit on everyone with the insane burst. 
---
Point is:  embrace that you CAN heal and you have utilities that people want. It will help you get your elemental gear with the symbiotic relationships.
---
FR I'd like to know how people jump to such conclusions. Common sense alone tells you it won't run on the same exact clients as soon as you realize that 80% of the world looks completely different now.
---
&gt;priests letting people die on accident 
---
Pft I’ve played priest since the start. We let people die on purpose...
---
Properly is an expensive word.
---
I played a rogue, warrior and mage.
---
I am going to play a priest because I want a Benediction
---
Oh no doubt a dick move I am not saying I'm going to do it lol fuck that I try to help the community not grief it.
---
Ashenvale furbolg questline 
---
Ironforge tram rat whistle questline
---
Ungoro Linken quest chain for neat Legend of Zelda items
---
&gt; Depends on the scale of time dilation.
---
Right, that's why I said "in order to start noticing the effects". Time dilation occurs no matter what speed you're traveling relative to another observer, but it isn't a truly noticeable effect for humans until you get to a very high speed. Technically people who live at the top of a mountain will live longer relative to time observed by the people at the bottom of the mountain, but over the course of a human lifetime the time difference is on the order of nanoseconds. The effect exists, but it isn't something we'd notice.
---
Actually Fullscreen+144hz doesnt work at all for me, always resets to 60hz. Maximized Windowed however unlocks it completely, with me mostly sitting at 240fps+. buttery smooth tho, no stutters or hiccups
---
You say that now until you're about level 35 in STV and start thinking that x or y class would be really fun and reroll
---
Prebis is a functional metric for gear balance. PvP included.
---
Because it changes the class thus meaning more druids will be wanted in raid setups etc. etc.
---
A quality of life thing would be to make a buff not require a reagent or something, the things you suggested arent small things, hope you can see that.
---
WOTLK definitely had some elements that signaled WoW was heading in a bad direction, but on it's own I think it was a fun expansion. Every class had multiple viable specs and interesting/fun rotations. PvP was very solid, the raid content was great, allowing the playerbase to see Naxx, and Ulduar and ICC were two of the best raids WoW has ever seen. 
---
This one is a point of contention, but I really enjoyed the "instanced" zones. When used sparingly, I think it's an awesome way to tell a more interesting a long lasting story, as opposed to vanilla and BC where you quest through a whole zone and supposedly "solve" some problems but everything goes back to the way it was. Questing in Dragonblight was epic, and when you finished you actually saw and felt your accomplishment, which was pretty cool. Obviously it's not something they can (or I even want) implement into vanilla, but I think it would have been interesting to see a handful of zones have that style with the classic/BC story.
---
But I am talking about the "theme" of their race. Highborn are all about magic/arcane crystals/mana etc, while NE are all about trees, living close to the ground, archers and a bit of magic regards to Elune priests. Yeah, lorewise they are almost the same, but their flavor is different.
---
Carrot on a stick.
---
Will we need hammer quest chain or not if it is 1.13 though ??
---
I thought Rogue was high demand but also high competition.
---
Dick move mate
---
Arrogant fools! I am empowered by the souls of a thousand conquered worlds!
---
I don't think it's crazy to want to be a human in a fantasy world, as opposed to being something crazy like a centaur. It's relatable, and you are still immersed in the fantasy experience.
---
And Stranglethorn Vale. Sooo relaxing.
---
That's because there's very few downsides. Mages are top performers in pve, pvp, solo grinding, utility(ports/water), pretty much every aspect they're above average. Mages are THE caster dps in vanilla
---
Well yeah culturally they are different. I do t dispute that. Biologically and history wise however they are the same.
---
Warlock in Classic, going Priest this time. Reason is, I want to do that Benediction questline and get that beautiful staff. My alt will be Mage and/or Warlock, we'll see.
---
Warlock it is!
---
An oversight ;)
---
It really is a sign of our current, modern, weak society where people expect 'big daddy' to solve their problems for them. Not gonna make it too political here but let me say this: the atmosphere and social environment in classic WoW will be VASTLY different compared to the WoW of 2004-2007. And I say this as a 24 year old...
---
That's fine then. Going to be playing druid so wanted to see where I stand in world PvP, rogues should be easy then.
---
It's understandable, the tournament was complete garbage, but they followed it up with, imo, an even better raid than Ulduar with ICC.
---
Thanks this helps a lot! I am picking off both PvE and PvP. I plan to at least raid BWL. I'm off to college and going to live at home. There can't be a better time to start raiding in vanilla I feel. I was thinking Mage or Warlock as my main.
---
I want MoP warlock back :(
---
But the point is you don't need prebis in vanilla because MC just isn't difficult.
---
And it's only going to be easier today with modern skill levels/add-ons etc. 
---
Pre-bis is just a concept so that you pick the dungeons you do intelligently where you have the most helpful upgrade potential.
---
Only the tank needs to be reasonably geared.
---
Alot of classes that have strengths that aren't obvious or fun are in high demand. 
---
It's easy to see how a hunter's leveling speed a good and useful but a paladin's mana efficiency isn't as fun.
---
Even thought you need more of a class they might be harder to find due to population. you only want 2-3 druid and hunters, but hunters are way easier to find than druids. You never really have a hard time finding shamans but druids can be tricky, even though you require the same amount. 
---
Just look at the least played classes like. Priest, shaman, Paladin, Druid, Warlock. And they'll have an easier time getting in raid.
---
But as a Warrior, Hunter, Rogue, Mage. A ton of people play these so no matter how many you need you'll always have enough. 
---
If you 100% want a raidspot i'd say play shaman or priest, but pick what you want to play. I played resto shaman all through Wrath and hated it just because I wanted a raidspot. In vanilla you need 40 people to raid so you can't be picky or have the *perfect* raid comp.
---
what i was trying to say is that back then servers were tied to their database. now with phasing everything is dynamic and they can just bring up extra shards so to speak when the population gets too big for a specific zone to avoid overcrowding and players don't even have to reconnect because everything is done in the background. 
---
with old tech this wasn't possible. the only thing they could do is create entirely new server (realm).
---
I vaguely recall one our mages going arcane for a week and having issues with the bosses. Most of the serpentscale bosses produce some arcane damage so I'd imagine that they may also then have immunity as you say. I don't specifically recall what the issue was but he was back to frost the next week.
---
They shouldn't have added the spaceships in TBC. It was such a disaster as a result in Legion.
---
So you think it is a realistic idea that *all* miners in china would cooperate to perform a 51% attack? Dream on.
---
He’s correct, as a fury warrior you are a top tier dps and outside of raid consumables there’s really no need to be a no life player :)
---
# &lt;MF&gt;  A US adult raiding guild is LF a few quality members to join our ranks. 
---
**Who we are:** 
---
Goal-driven adult gamers, just like many of you. We are parents, workers, family members, but most of all, gamers. We love our hobby and love accomplishing our goal with friends. Many of us play nightly while others play casually. We understand real life and work with all our members to ensure everyone has a place. 
---
**Our plan:**
---
To raid, of course. Our core members have been gaming together for years and all came from a guild that cleared everything up to early Naxx in vanilla. We are looking to raid twice a week (3 hours per night) with the goal of seeing everything the game has to offer. 
---
**Who we are looking for:**
---
Adult gamers driven by a passion to succeed. We have the most hard core of players while also having super casual members. We are recruiting raiders who want to clear content in a timely manner in a non-toxic environment alongside other laid-back adult gamers. The goal is to make friends, kill lots of bosses, and make a ton of memories. Make no mistake. We are in it for the long haul. We want to provide you with a longterm home and a place to make some real memories. If this is the first time playing this content, or if you are coming back to experience it again, give us a look. You won't be disappointed. 
---
**The important stuff:**
---
**Days:** Either Tue/Wed or Tue/Thu
---
**Times:** 9p - Midnight EST (8/11 CST). Invites start 15 min before raid.
---
**Server:** PvP
---
**Voice:** Discord
---
**Age:** 18+
---
**Contact us:**
---
**Discord:** Pimsley#0836
---
What level do you start the quest line for these?
---
Serious question: who do you think goes OOM faster in PvP? I hated priest PvP healing because Stam buff was mana aids and viper sting
---
Meh I played a lot of classic and don't remember a ton of it. Feel like I am coming into it pretty new hahaha.
---
wrong. prebis lists only show pve relevant items, most of those are actual crap in regards to pvp.
---
I think you could create another group between 2 and 3, honestly.
---
Maybe what im thinking gets lumped into 2, but theres quite a few guilds out there already advertising for 4~6 hours of raiding per week (which i wouldnt call super casual, and isnt pugging, but im not quite sure i'd say is 'dedicated').  
---
I think that those types of guilds will probably be a bit more open to the 'less desired' specs in general, though theyre by no means filled with bad players, etc.  Mostly its likely to be people in their late 20s/30s/40s that have played the game for years, and just want a nice, relaxing MMO to chill out on after a long day of work/dealing with the kids/etc while having a few beers/a bowl/whatever.
---
I dont have kids, but thats the kind of guild ive been looking at.  I work too much to raid 'seriously', but i also want to clear content.  I dont need to do it super quick/seriously (so im not sure i'd call it quite 'dedicated'), i just want a solid group of people that can stay out of the fire and push buttons.
---
Don’t mind at all, happy to help
---
Just goes to show that cucks play both alliance and horde!
---
Personally I prefer the new models, especially on Forsaken with that tongue Physics.
---
Just dangling and moving left and right. 
---
Which is why I’d like everyone to be able to choose classic or new models. 
---
Not that I wouldn’t play without tongue physics, but man is it disgusting and cool.
---
I second Wrath, although not just for the LFD system. Wrath was also the first expansion that completely dropped the Classic progression system (Where most people had to gear up for the current raid by doing the previous raids). Sure, TBC had badge gear, but it was time-consuming enough (and badges dropped from Kara anyway) that it didn't complete kill off running the earlier raids. In Wrath, the day Uld launched, people basically stopped running Naxx entirely. Same with ICC, and every raid after - Blizzard removed any incentive to do the earlier raids in Wrath.
---
Thanks this really helps! I am thinking Warlock or Mage. But I am beginning to lean more towards Lock. Because I do plan to raid quite a bit until around AQ
---
You really want to counter a rogue, be a hunter. Druids fun and if you don’t get caught out of Bear form you can beat rogues, but TBH Druid damage is pretty low so it’s more about whittling people down than bursting.
---
Spooky boi!
---
Can only imagine the caster cries when the warrior takes the crescent staff.
---
55 for attunement to the core  
---
54 Dragonkin Menace (this one is a REALLY REALLY LONG CHAIN)
---
Going to nursing school combining with work in nursing home and another job in a caffee. I work my ass off (sometimes from 5:00 in the morning until 22:00 every day) but I will try to do some casual raiding. Real life is unfortunately more important than everything else. But don't give up hope and play the game. I will have to find some forums for where some people will casually raid (going to play with german peeps since I live there for 2 years). It would be a waste if I level up to 60 and realise there are just hardcore raiding guilds.
---
Man, I can't wait for the epic attunement chains. Some of my favorite times in WoW was grouping with guildies and getting attuned to Kara, SSC, and TK back in the BC days.
---
Nah, Crag is right. Warriors are a great matchup against hunters. Good warrior will get on you and stay on you. Net-o-matic is good for this matchup. Although warrior struggles if they don’t get the initial charge, admittedly.
---
But what are you comparing to? I wish bfa had half of these things.
---
I agree with this as well. I think people like wrath for the Lich king. Outside of ICC and Ulduar the rest of the expansion was pretty much the start of the downfall of wow.
---
That’s literally DarkRP on Gmod.
---
I usually shot the people playing music if I didn’t like it.
---
I think that's the main thing what's important, not their bloodline. It's like if there would be an MMO about Warhammer 40k, they would make an Eldar expansion and zones will be about Craftworld Eldars, Exodites, and Dark Eldars and people would complain that these zones are the same because they are all Eldars, ignoring the fact that culturally they are very distinct from each other.
---
A few mining pools would be enough. 6 mining pools control 80% of bitcoins mining which 5 out of those 6 are from China. 
---
Doesn’t matter if I think it’s realistic or not... it’s a possibility whether you and me like it or not..
---
Neat. As a warrior I think hunters are the same thing, as long as I can get the charge :)
---
Exactly friend, there are always dicks from both sides.
---
I'm not sure when they changed it, but in early vanilla you could definitely be killed be open world fires pretty easily (like the braziers in ironforge.) They ticked for a ton of fire damage early on. I'm not sure you could ever be killed by player fires though.
---
Both are great
---
The only way this would be feasible would be to heavily regulate it. Others have already commented on the many issues it could cause, but there are certainly workarounds for each scenario.
---
1) It would have to have a toggle. Maybe I want to wear my mic and chat with friends on a different program while I play WoW. I don't want proximity chat interfering with my other chat.
---
2) It would need a filter. It would need to differentiate between ambient nose and actual voice. Not all mics are capable of filtering out that noise, and I wouldn't want to hear someone else's background noise when they just walk by me. It would also need a filter for profanity for those who don't want to hear it or have their kids hear it.
---
3) It would need automatic volume control. I don't want my ears to burst when an ass is either yelling into his mic or blaring loud music.
---
4) It would need language translators to translate one factions' speech into whatever jibberish for the other faction.
---
It would be pretty expensive to actually implement it...but if it did make it into the game like this then I would give it a chance.
---
My main was a gnome, but the night elf zones are still the ones that bring back most memories for me. The visuals and sounds really made me feel like being in an enchanted forest. You know, the "na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na" song.
---
That being said, the ambience, music and visuals of BFA are actually very good. I have started playing again just to pass some time, and I am trying to focus much more on what Blizzard is doing right than wrong. It has actually made me realize that the new zones are quite well done.
---
Except for Nazmir. Didn't like it.
---
You can be expected to be given by your guild the cost of your respec to resto. You can pretty much expect that.
---
Rogue is definitely in higher demand because of their very high single target dps. Honestly, only the guilds min/maxing and aiming for fast or server first progression will be able to be picky. For most guilds they'll take people that show up since getting 40 players to consistently log on is the real raid boss.
---
I don’t think they’ve specifically commented on those kinds of add-ons yet.     
---
Add-Ons that modified the keystroke behaviour were a thing even back in the day (for example “Snowfall”), but I’d imagine that Blizzard will take necessary counter-measures if they feel that those add-ons are too powerful and would upset the balance of the game.    
---
We’ll have to wait and see, I guess.
---
Same. Am not leaving disappointed
---
\^
---
Join a fucking discord server for your class, people. Every time someone posts something here, I know of a better version from Discord or Barrens chat.
---
It's a quest reward though.
---
Literally made me lol
---
OMG LOL...I filtered by 2004/2005 and some of the first pvp videos are so noobish compared to current vanilla pvp videos...it's hilarious how bad we really were in the beginning.
---
Comparing to vanilla-wotlk. I didn’t like MoP much, and I’m listing reasons why myself and a lot of others didn’t. Why am I being downvoted for an opinion and a list of reasons for that opinion lmao. 
---
Some big MoP fans in the thread I guess.
---
Nah, many people probably dropped the game when they found out what's up with daily quests in 5.0.
---
It's been theorycrafted. Every mage in your raid is 31/0/20 except for 1 WC mage. The reason you use frostbolt is because of the high talent synergy.
---
I know the female dwarf thing is a fun meme, and its even true...but it still kind of surprises me.
---
I know theyre not the 'cute' or 'sexy' option that Gnomes/Nelves are, and theres probably a fair amount of female players that are going to go human...but female dwarves actually look pretty nice, imo.
---
Ive made a few female DI Dwarves on live and actually like them.  Granted, i like male DI Dwarves as well, but the females look quite nice.  Solid (no pun intended) models, nothing really annoying about them (too big like tauren, too small like gnomes at times), etc.
---
Ive actually considered going female on my Dwarf Priest on Classic, though i think ill stick with male.  Maybe when i make a pally alt ill go female for the hell of it.
---
This is it.  People seamlessly transition between comparing 1v1 and group fighting ability without delineating between the two.  This is gonna cause a lot of confusion for people that never played classic.
---
Group PvP, with dedicated support and excellent gear?  Warrior is S-tier.
---
Solo with so-so gear?  Garbage.
---
Rogue in solo PvP with decent gear?  A-tier.
---
Rogue in group PvP with BiS gear?  Good.
---
The game's been "solved" more or less for years. But I imagine the hardcore min/maxer's will either be too few to notice or too cloistered within their own groups to give you any real grief if you want to just have fun experimenting.
---
Play what you want, you're bound to come across plenty of others doing the same.
---
Lok'Tar!
---
No it is not. My origins are in Macedonia which is far poorer and normal wage there is 400€. You live in a bubble, Balkan is not Bangladesh or India
---
Agree. Definitely a small percentage
---
He's just a poor boy from a poor family. Pay for his sub so he can die in STV!
---
Play indie games. Devs don't have excuses. If their product sucks, they're gone. Divinity Original Sin, Transistor, Bastion, Path of Exile, Grim Dawn, Celeste, Into The Breach, Risk of Rain 1/2, Dead Cells and the list goes on.
---
You should look somewhere else if mainstream sucks. Regardless of industry you're instrested in.
---
The top guild will require the pre bis because it mean faster run. Can't have sub 1hour run if everyone is slacking.
---
Also, you still need to gear for bwl, on some spec you can have only a few items in mc/ony that are better than pre bis so you will still need these anyway. And you are not guaranteed to get the MC upgrades before BWL if you play a class with lot of competition.
---
2H fury is good, but if you like to group with healers, Sweeping Strikes will basically double your kill rate since you start pulling 2 at once.
---
I had to click "context" to understand what you were talking about, lol!
---
They absolutely butchered tauren.
---
Afaik, the damage from the campfire was relatively low, so really only useful to place under yourself to prevent CC (break sap, blind, poly, ice trap, scatter shot, sleep, etc.) but the damage was so low natural out of combat regen would outpace it at high levels.
---
Now the real question is, does the damage from campfires generate rage, and can it be used in tandem with an [Unconscious Dig Rat](https://classicdb.ch/?item=5052) for bears and warriors to passively generate and stay at max rage while defending AB/AV/WSG nodes?
---
Shut the fuck up
---
Aeldari and Drukari not only have cultural differences though... like Drukari feed off people’s pain and torture people for fun and sustenance. You could make an argument for them actually changing enough to be classified as different species now thanks to Aeldari eating actual food. 
---
Also Highborne live within Night Elf society. Highborne and Nightelves would be like America really. Different groups care more about different things but we’re still American.
---
Hi! SS/FS/Trap. New fight, enjoy your kite!
---
Ive actually seen quite a few guilds that raid weekends pop up on the guilds discord.  I considered it myself (my schedule isnt anywhere near that crazy, but my base day is 10.5 hours gone at least, and if i go to the gym its more like 11.5-12), but i just cant give up my weekends in the summer.  Too much fishing and stuff to do.
---
No matter what you are presented you will always keep shilling xrp the digital fiat.
---
1. Ye it's really good and the spec changes based on your wep
---
2. Yeah every 2 hander if yours and theres some crazy ones
---
3. no, but you get intercept, costs 10 rage, useable in berserker stance. Which is very similar to charge. 
---
Hope you enjoy it!
---
Laughs in holy paladin
---
Daily Quest quiting is fair and I understand that, but that’s not what I ever hear. I hear bitching about it and how the expansion would have been better without it, but every time someone bitches about MoP it’s Pandas and calling it a childish, kiddie friendly expansion.
---
The wait of Classic kills me. I'm ready to play now, I know I have enough time now. But I'm not sure what's gonna happen in the summer.
---
Forced me to buy a copy of Legends of Aria. Yet to play it, but hopefully it'll help.
---
What phase will it be available?
---
As a bulgarian, I can confirm this is not a monthly wage, he probably meant allowance. Minimum monthly wage here is roughly 300 euros.
---
I understand why people like the new models but the artistic liscense taken with some of them and the scale in which things have been dialed up on the high fantasy meter to become more over the top is just not for me. The way they were made in vanilla is a middle ground to me. Don't get me started on the animations, or the hairstyles.
---
Fair enough
---
But they’re not worthless- we get HKs from them! Especially the ones that suicide charge in BGs, I love those guys!
---
I don’t understand why the two of you think I’m disagreeing with him, i’m further saying paladins are just dope healers in general, not just pvp
---
That's the easiest thing to remember when you try to remind yourself about the expansion, what was good and bad about it.
---
No it was a real question. I’m debating both myself
---
I just really enjoy the lore of Tirisfal. The guardians of Tirisfal, Arthas betraying his kingdom, Sylvanas betraying Arthas and forming the forsaken. And then in WoW you get the beginnings of the Scarlet Crusade, the instance (though that isn't really part of the "starting"). Undercity is also a pretty rad idea and cool looking city.
---
In TBC there was a bug that allowed Shamans to damage friendly targets by placing a Fire Nova Totem and logging out right before it sets off. I used kill random low levels and spam bots near the AH before I got a warning from a GM. I'm not sure if it worked in vanilla.
---
Still one of my favorite WoW videos lol.  
---
Although Paladins being paper never felt quite right to me.
---
with double mage you just make everyzone in the game your aoe grinding zone since lvl 14 thats when you learn arcane explotion
---
I thought it was the aq phase for classic.
---
shaman pvp is awesome... and enhance is great... you are listening to elitist min maxers...
---
ok so it's not ideal for premade bg or raids... 
---
but just random q bg and wpvp you will definitely enjoy it....
---
it is more enjoyable than frustrating ... nothing like those crazy windfury procs and big numbers and watching someones health pool drop in an instant.
---
i'd be perfectly happy with vanilla -&gt; tbc -&gt; wrath cycle on repeat as these were the best expansions and many share the same views. rotate them every year so people can experience them and slap on optional character transfers for those that want to advance to the next expansion and they're set for the next 4 years.
---
at this point i'm almost positive that blizzard will re-release tbc and wotlk down the line once they see how popular vanilla will be. i'm sure they'll start working on tbc once vanilla gets released if they aren't already.
---
wotlk already started to implement too many things that strayed away from MMORPG forumula that made wow popular however it was still a very good expansion. sadly after it everything went to shit. cataclysm was horrible and mop was decent story wise but everything else was already too gutted because of their game vision from wotlk onward.
---
it would be super interesting to see what would happen if they kept vanilla/tbc formula and released an entirely new expansion after wotlk.
---
I do like undercity and Arthas's story a lot.
---
And they cant kill you anyway you just vanish.
---
That is true. You can gank the kids  in RedRidge as a decked out 60 rogue and true daredevils toggle PvP on a PvE server so they are always at a disadvantage, got it.
---
Glad they made space for both.
---
The other answers are good but I would also say it relates to efficiency. Minimizing detractors, and maximizing growth. For example, leveling in a way that you can ensure you will not need to grind for gold to buy your mount after 40, since that grind would detract from you hitting 60 sooner while having the gold beforehand would help you get to 60 sooner.
---
I mean most of the kiddy arguments seemed to be by people who didn’t play or give the expansion a chance since it’s about as dark as Ulduar.
---
I really like it but I've done it a bunch. The main reason is the pure number of quests is just really high and I have them all memorized. But from reading your post I realize your right, it is aesthetically pretty bad compared to the beauty of elwynn. 
---
I don't really like Durotar, because it feels like it has no quests and its so bright it hurts my eyes. Also it's really crowded being the starter for 2 races.
---
Try it out if you want. But it’s bad. I played priests and only priests for years of play time.
---
If you don’t downrank shields and lead with holy fire (your best spell) then it’s just as bad as before, though.
---
It also depends on your weapons. You can weave in auto attacks between mind flays with any weapon that has an attack speed of 3 or quicker.
---
You lose a lot of OP spells from the disc tree. You should be stacking spirit and get 15% regen. You really need your damage to be significantly higher for it to compare.
---
Specced PWS, Inner Fire, regen, wands. They are all non negotiable mana. Mana is damage. It’s been a year but use 13/0/5 and dump the remaining 17 points into holy (or disc).
---
Most people play priests wrong. Don’t listen to guides. Spec into shadow once your mind flay levels up (at 46 of the top of my head).
---
Weave in autos and play around the 5 second rule. Keep your mana at 30-60%. Let it dwindle slowly over time but any mana not spent is XP/hour you lack.
---
Don’t drink often before you are shadow. Even then you can probably avoid it by downranking mind flays.
---
Stack spirit if that is not clear. Ignore int,str,dex. Ignore vit unless you are on a PvP server and are looking to fight instead of flight.
---
At 60 with spell crit gear pallies are obnoxious. You won’t run out of mana.
---
Priests are 20x easier to level, get benediction... can shield quickly to get enough time to rip those heals in pvp due to it. Paladins tend to rely on flat heals to get the job done (no fear less util than priest). Mana sustain shouldnt be a huge concern in pvp though, the fact that you’re a plate wearing badass that can bubble if they focus you instead of your buddy is invaluable in pvp
---
I see. I'm just really fighting the warrior idea. It seems like everything I see is about warriors and it makes it feel like there's gonna be 8500000000 of them. I'd like to not be playing world of warriorcraft. If a 40 man us 25 warriors deep thats lame.
---
Top tier TPS!

It worked, I mained a feral druid throughout entire vanilla so I remember.

I also remember our night elf hunters shadowmelding far from the flag and just annihilating (Aimed shot from shadowmeld) anyone who tried to ninja the "empty" base. We used to leave our NE hunters to guard Stables just for that.

I ran MC at 59 on my nelf priest, dinged 60 later that night and got my first tier piece the next day.

&gt; My question is how viable is Arms spec?
---
In pvp, very viable.
---
&gt; Are there any end game 2h axes that are exceptional?
---
In pvp, [Dark Edge of Insanity](http://classicdb.ch/?item=21134). The proc is not broken by taking damage.
---
&gt; As far as Charges(the ability) goes, can you do it in combat?
---
Nope.
---
&gt;like Drukari feed off people’s pain and torture people for fun and sustenance
---
And Highborn are addicted to magic, wither and die without it. Yeah, Highborn were accepted to the Night Elves because it's the easiest way to make Night Elf mages available and they had some questchains, but having them didn't change the way Night Elves are presented that much.
---
One per player, but it doesn't mean you can't have many players place them.
---
You are absolutely right, I'm from Bulgaria and 60 dollars/month is blasphemy. Gipsy street cleaners get about 400.
---
I imagine in most 5 man groups *someone* will know where to go, so if the tank doesn't know he just needs to ask. Also, the tank out dpsing the dps was relatively common as a lot of the time your tank was just a pally or warrior in their dps spec. The more difficult part will come in the pulls. A lot of the trash in the mid-high level dungeons required CC.
---
Problem is that whirlwind axe on a fresh server is going to be a bit difficult to get. You can't just buy the charms. While it can carry you to 50, you'll sacrifice speed to get it. If you can get a group to help you get it, it would be good, but that isn't likely either.
---
As a Bulgarian myself I will tell you that $60 is not a legit wage.
---
We don't know what are his circumstances so it is false to assume if he works or not.
---
But I will tell you this, around 30%+ of the population lives bellow poverty, the only way for a person to get a chance for a decent life is to go abroad, assuming he comes from a poor family. i mean it is doable in Bulgaria, but I will give you example with myself: Graduated Uni with CS degree and went to become a Fullstack Dev. Went abroad few years later to work and I am earning  times what I used to and the expenses are the same, even in some regard cheaper.
---
Everything you mentioned are the reasons I like it.  I also enjoy the brighter,  slightly easier zones,  but there is an atmosphere of gloom and despair in Tirisfal that makes completing it feel like a real accomplishment.  Mostly RP reasons,  but I love everything about that zone. It almost feels like some kind of Munchian nightmare that you may never escape.   The restless dead are wandering in Tirisfal,  and you,  Hero,  must escape the nightmare.
---
monkaHmm
---
My only thought for focusing axes is literally the talent for the increase crit chance.  Slow hits, but man if I do and it's a crit that'd be huge.
---
Loot will be tradeable for 2 hours but only for raids.
---
Its fine in Retail, so it will be fine in Vanilla. 
---
And that Exploit in AQ was no Model-Swapping. People literally edited the fucking Worldspace!
---
definitely nifty stopwatch and skull of impending doom. if you don't do them then you'll have to do it at 60. and the nifty stopwatch is really great for leveling.
---
ah yeah fair enough, in ordinary terms of noticing it yeah that's true.
---
I just have a habit of looking at it from an experimental point of view, comes with the job, can't help it :P
---
When that stormwind chorus kicks in.  Hnnngg.
---
It is for raids only. You can't trade in any dungeon (includes brs).
---
If you're a resto druid you're actually a lot less gear dependent than most specs. You have stealth, you have cheetah, and you can heal whoever is the most geared / skilled player on your BG team to help your chance of winning. The biggest downsides to druids are no regular rez for 5man and the fact that HOTs can't keep up in T3 pvp meta.
---
I know, right? I’d love to duo level. There are so many good options too

WoW Human males are severely deformed body builders with weird necks and blocky muscles. It's been like that forever. They're...quite bad, and I recall people saying so for practically the entire history of the game.

Don't get me wrong, I'll play one but the new ones at least have a higher polycount on those biceps...

That’s the Nightborn and High Elves not the Highborn I believe.

The optimum spec for bwl/Mc is arctually 31 in arcane and 20 in frost. This let’s you use most of the important arcane talents as well as the essential frost talents to boost your frostbolts.
---
Well I guess it would depend what level you are?

lol I just remember bubble hearthing to all these combos...

While I wouldn't mind even a lvl 58 healer in MC, it wouldn't cross my mind for a tank \^\^

A big reason why I enjoy Tirsifal isn't just the lore perspective but how it is properly reflected in the enviroment. It's the same reason I enjoy the plaguelands, despite what you might consider drawbacks you could cut the atmosphere with a knife. I like the feeling of danger. I like the idea that my character is going to have a rough time and the setting combed with that really makes for a memorable experience. The first time entering Undercity to hear the whispers hidden under the audio I think is the peak 'vanilla'. It's not technically a real 'RPG' but it has all the elements there to make up for the systems you would expect. All of what you hate about the zone is what makes it good to me, apart from annoying abilities and spawns, like I always said it properly reflects the zone. A very dark, dangerous, hostile place that has been racked by an apocalyptic plague. To appreciate the zone you really have to love the original WC3 and the lore. If you care about the backstory to these elements they stop being a hinderance.

Mists launch was still fairly big, 10 million players. I doubt that many people didn't even try to play it because of the theme. I think they tried it, got through the lvling in these Asian zones, tried out dungeons and raids also focused on Asian style and decided that they were fed up with it.
---
If a bunch of 40 year old dads are flaming each other in Classic, I will be gravely disappointed.
---
Yep, wear leather as a warrior in PVP and wonder why you die even faster than usual \^\^
---
Sure but there's plenty of time to do dungeons for prebis gear while you're raiding MC
---
The topic is about getting into raids. You don't need prebis for MC, and by the time BWL comes out you'll have MC upgrades and will have had months to get some dungeon drops. Even then if you have some garbage slots you can still do BWL.
---
And if you're trying to get into the "top guild" well you should already know what's required
---
Everything depends on situation, current gear, current spec, skill level and if the attack comes without warning.
---
Considering all these, it's pretty hard to outline a specific order.
---
What discord servers would you recommend for classic warriors?
---
I guess you could have some sort of macro to switch to a high-spirit staff when you're OOC? And then switch back to primary weapon when you go into combat again.
---
Negligible gains but might be worth giving up one inventory slot for it.

You'd hear echoes throughout the Barrens...
---
"WHERE THE F*CK IS MANKRIK'S WIFE?"
---
He said it was between Warrior and Priest.
---
Well when I’ve questioned people who had the kiddie arguement the majority of the time they didn’t know about the secret police, the Sha, the mantid or genocide.
---
It probably won't work but I hope to come back from afk to see campfires at my feet anyway.  People trying to kill me (IRL and in WoW) is what I live for.
---
They're viable, yes. A lot of people harp on hunters for falling off post-BWL damage wise, but this really only matters if you're wanting to be in a top-tier guild pushing server firsts, and you care about showing up on top of damage meters.
---
Otherwise, don't be an idiot, know your class, be punctual, be properly raid prepped, and you'll get into raids no problem. People talk like there is an endless supply of BiS DPS in full T2 - there may be if you're the top guild getting to pick and choose, but reality is there isn't. Getting 40 people in PvE specs in minimum pre-raid BiS is a tall order, being able to pick your class comp on top of that is ridiculously hard.
---
One thing to remember too is that raiding isn't the only thing that counts. You're going to spend a lot of time outside of raids farming and doing PvP, which the hunter class excels at. Hunters have one of the best, if not, the best gold farming tactics in the game. You'll be spending a lot of time farming gold for epic mount, enchant, consumables, and respecs at minimum.
---
They are also the best levelers as well, and considering leveling is a 10-15 day /played task for the average player, this is a real thing to consider.
---
Hunters also have a very low skill floor, and very high skill ceiling. What I mean by this, is to get to 60 you just need to get to 10 for your pet, and you can auto shoot with auto growl, not having to learn any more to get by. But at 60 this will do crap damage and get you kicked from groups. To be good, you need to manage your pet, learn to kite and use abilities between autoshots, and learn how to use feign death to drop combat and abuse this mechanic to perform out of combat tasks during encounters to max your dps. This takes practice and learning, which compared to say a mage, only has to spam frost bolt as their entire rotation, to be competitive with you.
---
So yes they are very viable, but just understand what you're getting into!
---
just play whatever you're immediately interested in and then roll with it, next thing you know you'll be level 30 in stranglethorn vale. probably not warrior because it's a very difficult class to play and pretty much every other classes will kill you assuming you're not on a pve realm. priest, hunter, and warlock are very easy to level. it's also pretty hard to die as a rogue and your vanish gives you something like 80 levels of stealth so you can escape from 60s. 10s instant blind is invaluable because pvp trinket doesn't exist.
---
You overestimate the drop rate. In vanilla the bindings dropped before BWL was open, and people just had no idea what they were for. I think one of the world first binding drops ended up going to a hunter because no one knew what they were.
---
My alt mage was a 49 twink for a while just for fun and I had a ton of +frost damage gear. My hp pool was pretty funny, but I could two shot most people
---
MoP is the day I realized I was to old to  be playing this children's game anymore.
---
And then he goblin rocket helms on to you and it’s back to step one where a warrior is on top of you pumping out mortal strikes.
---
Arcane doesn't scale well. It also has no arcane only buffing talents. It had an invisible debuff that will push off other debuffs. Plus it wasn't highly mana efficient. It could be with lucky CC procs but if you ever had to move early into the spell you lost all your mana for it while frostbolt you don't spent till complete. People may have used it back then because they didn't know better and thought the no pushback from damage was worth more.
---
Yeah, High Elves are made out of Highborn and people that were exiled out from Night Elf communities for practicing magic. But they are basically the same in the end, magic crackheads with high potential in using it.
---
Trying to balance 1v1 or 2v2 PVP is a fools errand IMO.  You lose too much class complexity and it takes away the fun. 
---
I think when TBC rolls around again, Blizz should continue to add more abilities/complexity, but focus on larger group PVP vs 2v2 arenas.  That just cannot work.
---
Maybe 10v10 arenas?
---
So, they existed?

UD players are already 40% of horde pop. Imagine if the zone was charming, easy mobs and rewarding quests ? ;-)

My favorite starting zone is by far Mulgore even if the quests involve a lot of running.
---
No, I mean I’m pretty sure Highborn don’t have the dependency that BE, HE and NB do. 
---
I even tried to check the wiki and it says they were just a noble class and illidan was one of them but not officially due to his skill in magic.
---
My favorite zone and it’s not even close. I just went 72-80 all in the hills. I love the music and the pine trees and literally everything. Wrath has some of the best zones in the game.
---

They probably have gone through quests and story without giving attention to it because it's all "kiddie" and stupid for them, just grinding through quests to get to 90 and start the endgame content.

No he isn't. His point is in his last sentence, and his point makes no sense. There's nothing to realize. Classic is classic. It's a preexisting state of the game that's being recreated. Nothing is going to change.
---
Paladins are much more mana efficient. However, they lack offensive utility, and their heals are less potent than priests. I prefer mixing r13 gear with a lot of t2 on priest getting a ton of stam and spirit, then going 26 points at least in disc for a lot of mana regen. It helps a ton. The most annoying tb ing about priest is rebuffing yourself everytime you die....or fight a shaman...
---
I feel like responding to beta rumors shouldn’t have taken the place of our weekly blue post, but I suppose they saw a golden opportunity and took it.
---
Yep where it all began (for me at least.) August 2007 human warrior. I had never played an MMORPG before and had no idea what this game was about. Only selected human warrior cause that’s what my dad was. Otherwise I didn’t know anything about it. This brings back such fond memories of the last 12 years. Through all the ups and downs, there are zones/music that correlate to certain time periods in my life. Good or bad. Regardless of where wow goes in the future, I will always have those memories and associations.
---
Not better than Enrage, fury scales better
---
If you play warrior you'll be expected to tank in raids, even if its offtanking at times. If you don't want to tank at all, play rogue.
---
People say MoP is actually really good, which is probably why I never spent too much time with Legion either. I played through all of MoP, and it had a handful of cool raids, but the class mechanics felt dull compared to older WoW. The world was *beautiful* but the hub based quests and horribly cheesy/tacky cinematic quests (like with the hozen) kind of took away from that beauty. 
---
So I tried Legion too, since a lot of people said it was *the best* expansion. Real quickly I just did not feel that way so I quit after 2-3 months. Sucked me back in with 7.2 and quit again. 
---
I want to enjoy them, but even in the next unknown expac, I know the first thing I do will level 10 times in 5 hours, hit cap and do dungeons, and probably do LFR before I’ve done the whole raid in normal. Then the whole allure gets spoiled, because I felt pressured to get gear :/
---
Omg you are so right. I  could not lay my finger on it but its idd a stretched out dwarf...
---
/woooosh
---
I think it's because all the Highborn were always around powerful sources of magic and the great sundering was the rude awakening for them when the Well of Eternity was gone.
---
Everyone hated every version of WoW when it was current.
---
I hate 30/0/21. I use to love but now PvP groups force you to use it. I want my sweet heals ):
---
The face on the left looks like something out of Shrek.
---
&gt;which one would you say it the easier of the two to master?
---
I think dps warrior is easier than rogue, as long as you wirlwind and bloodthirst on CD you get most of your damage out. Mastering them tho? It's a hard choice theres tons of min maxing stuff you can do with items and broken mechanics that make them both really complex. 
---
I'd say if you like playing with other people most of the time you play pick a warrior, they do much better farming gold, in wpvp, in BGs with other players. But rogues do all of that solo. 
---
If you want to pvp I think Arms pvp is relatively straightforward and the hard part is probably when to use what consumes, like when to rage pot when to FAP. Rogue is managing all your cooldowns and it takes a really long time to know if you need blind to kill someone or if you can go without it.
---
I play rogue tho so i'm probably bias. I hate tanking so I usually don't play warrior. If those don't bother you i'd go with the warrior.
---
Orgrimmar Vs. Ironforge
---
Thats the question.
---
Same here, but with HotW/NS spec for me as a Druid.
---
Everyone would disable it because of all that Russian kids in Ironforge

my favourite quests, were the long quests in the Plaguelands and the battle of Darrowshire quests.
---
For Ony it depends on the faction. For MC I think it's 55+
---
Thats a really cool idea for a documentary, I hope you post it here when you make it.

I was there but I was 9 years old so I won't be of much help lol.
---
I remember landing from the flight master in Ironforge while leveling my paladin, the flight master was dead and there were some bones, I figured it was just horde and walked toward the AH, I got to the common area and died instantly due to being level 30 or so. I ran around in ghost form and saw people were dying as soon as they got close to other people and people were /yelling stuff in caps so i resurrected at max range and hearthed to southshore and didn't even realize it was a big deal until I read articles about it later. I remember warlocks troll summoning demons in cities all the time and letting them lose along with horde raiding cities or fun. I never even realized I had gotten a debuff and that's what killed me. I'm sure it affected max level people much more as they
---
Did they change this? I levelled a human on retail and feel like I haven't heard this song in a decade.
---
1- Arms is not only viable, it's the best PVP spec period !
---
2- oh brother, you and 17 millions other warrior drool other the same weapons. You don't absolutely need an axe for PVP. Check [classicdb.ch](https://classicdb.ch).
---
3- you can't charge in combat, you need to switch to berserker stance and use intercept
---
I think Garrosh as the final boss was excellent. Garrosh escaping and opening up time travel? Less excellent.
---
...but this shit with Sylvanas... where the fuck are they leading it... is she poised to be the *second* warchief final boss? Meanwhile the alliance is more “the good guys” with every expac.
---
Love this song!
---
No idea, I recall getting it as a result of the hammer.
---
You can heal as that spec easy, it's getting the Elemental gear that's the hard part. Esp getting spell power trinkets like ToEP.
---
What a deception
---
Undead mage will for sure be a really strong pvp pick. In 1v1 other then lock and priest I think hunters are the big weakness for mages. In group fights a warrior with BoF from paladin might cause some troubles. But still very strong choice. I think once geared fires has burst which is just as good, as ice has control in pvp. 
---
I know it's the unpopular choice but I'm playing druid. They shine in open world 1v1 situations extremely versatile class. The true Jack of all trades master of none.
---
And this is exactly why I always spoiled a couple of the healers in my guild with spare gear/enchants/help. Small price to pay to always have a healer in the raid that will bump you up in the healing priority.
---
If you raid at a level where you can get those weapons, you'll get enough crit from the rest of your gear.
---
Basically you take the best 2 handers you can get and spec around it.
---
The most important factor is not which class you play but how you play that which you chose. If you're an exceptional player you will stand out among the crowd. Don't be satisfied by picking  a class simply to fill a quota, be an educated player who puts effort into their character and you will find a home in a good guild.
---
If were talking Horde ambience then it’s all about Tirisfal Glades
---
For me, barrens are associated with the yellow/gold color of it's "dry" Flora on the sunlight.
---
Remember that class is a selection after assuming the player is in pre-raid BiS, PvE spec, shows up to raids, and has farmed consumables. Ideally you may not want more than 2-3 hunters when pushing beyond BWL because Mage/Rogue/Warrior/Warlock provide better DPS, but it's not as simple as stopping in Org/SW and picking one up.
---
Just make sure you're in a viable spec for your class and do everything right, and raid spots will be open for you.
---
This is a tough one. I played warrior in Vanilla to Grand Marshal and played rogue from TBC through Cata. 
---
They are both a lot of fun but ultimately I stuck with the rogue because life was simpler. You just stab stuff. With warrior you carry tanking gear, DPS gear, and pvp gear. The repair bills for plate get pretty bad in Vanilla without daily quests and warriors don’t farm as well as rogues. World pvp is pretty one sided with you running back to your corpse if people get the jump on you, whereas rogues control the terms of engagement. 
---
If you’re looking for a challenge or big time commitment you can do warrior, but if you’re looking for quality of life rogue is less stressful.
---
I recall being level 6 and begging all mobs to drop something, so I could finally afford that legs off vendor, get 12 more armor, and be stronger.
---
Armor was an universal measure of strength. Guess, that's because people didn't know that much about other stats.
---
Oh yeah, for sure. As long as blizzard doesn’t bow to these folks it’s going to be just fine. It’s like Bill Burr said, you have the 50/60s generation who were tossed into the world young and those who still live with their parents that can’t seem to find a job when they’re 40 y/o. And we have to find a middleground. Hopefully the next generation is less fucked up.
---
Titanforging didn’t exist until Legion.
---
Warforging was fine.
---
This is why I'll be leveling this area regardless of the class I pick.
---
It'll probably be blizzlike so yes?
---
nothing set in stone tho, I think only one person can loot it at a time so just loot it yourself when the fight ends to see the loot then ask the people to come up and take their items one by one.
---
Step 1.  Roll horde. Step 2.  Profit
---
I liked the original human model and animation better too. They look goofy now, and their hair is definitely not the same haircuts, changing the whole look of your character. The animation went from being relatively plain (but very grounded) to a very pronounced bobbing jog that makes them look silly imo. I was very excited for the animation and character changes, but at the top my of head I can think of zero races that benefited from it in the end.

The music,  particularly the Celtic viola music, is unreal. Gives me ridiculous nostalgia pangs. I don't understand why they don't go for this type of vibe in their zones more often.  I think I'll go listen now...

It kind of was. LFG, 4 separate difficulties for raids, 5-man content was too damn easy, and power bloat out the ass. Still an excellent expac, but it causes ripples that keep growing.

you should play what you like the most, but warrior is definitely way harder than rogue. in both pvp and pve, the height of rogue difficulty is knowing when to use thistle tea and using your adrenaline rush with blade flurry. in wpvp warrior is either win or die, and a lot of classes you will just be unbeatable without engineering while leveling. for rogue you can always vanish prep vanish blind sprint etc you have a lot of tools to escape high level ganks.
---
Meta-shift, no.

But there is alot of room for non-meta builds because 40 spots is harder to fill than people think.

Because you’re showing an obvious bias.

Saying MoP had welfare gear, the new class sucked, loot piñata (I assume you mean world bosses), and a race that’s been in existence since WC3 is bad.
---
But then you say Wrath is better even though Wrath had a new, extremely broken class, faceroll dungeons and raids, welfare gear, and loot piñatas in VoA, EoE, the dragon sanctums, and Onyxia.

I think Cata onward turned the game into something else. So Classic really is the second coming of Christ to a lot of people. Their favorite game that was forever lost is finally coming back.
---
Got the 2 first pieces, it stopped making sense monetarily after that tbh. I'd love to do it, but by the time you're generally able to get it done, you don't need it, and the cost is vicious. Hundreds of gold per piece as I recall, scaling higher and higher as you went along.
---
Yes it will.
---
I think frost had the AoE advantage for adds with blizzard.
---
Get rid of dishonorable kills, or rework them to make sense and add something to wpvp
---
Are you talking about pve or pvp? And if so which spec for warrior / rogue? Combat dagger or combat swords and tank or fury for warrior?

MoP gets waaay to much crap for having Pandaren. It was a fine expansion.

WoD was good for the first month and a half, and then it was a dumpster fire of repetitiveness.

You're certainly right. I don't find myself to be a god like player at all. But I wanna roll what I want, but also something that allows me to shine. I want someone to think "hey that's the warlock blynqs who was pretty good." I feel if I play mage or rogue or smth like that that is overly abundant that'll happen less so ig.
---
Mop was miles better than anything after Wrath (with class mechanics and boss fights, outside of ulduar hard does and heroic LK—it could be argued MoP was better than Wrath)
---
I want to play paladin super bad, but i dread having to wear cloth and leather for 80% of my armor. Thats just vanilla itemization
---
It shouldnt be required to change blues at 40 for lesser Greens, just cos they are plate/mail etc,   The5 mans arent that tough, and by the time you get to 50+ for the tougher 5 mans, you should have replaced the armor via quest rewards anyway.
---
Yes, buffing is brutal, viper sting, and no counter to poly except trinket, and easily focused. I love dispel but I might give it up just to live longer and not constantly be OOM and drinking
---
Thanks all
---
R u on that wsg server?
---
That's a fair point and something to consider. In the end, I'm personally more interested in the PvE content. That's really what it should come down to for people. I mean, the difference is right in the name!
---
If he is a kid, then no. Depends on where he lives and what he does. I am not surprised by this, he probably does something part time for a few hours. If he was employed full time he would get minimum of £260/month which is ok if he doesnt pay any rent and bills.
---
When I was growing up, I was very lucky to be able to afford a wow subscription, none of my friends could. To this day this is still valid for kids under 18 in Bulgaria, so I don't think he is lying.
---
I always recommend that you play the class you enjoy playing the most as thats what you will put the most effort into. Classic is a long haul experience and if you're just playing something to fill a raid spot rather than playing what you enjoy it will detract from the overall experience. Best of luck on choosing!
---
Yep
---
Now that you mentioned it you might be right it's the totem you have that let's you see where you placed it
---
Mop was a sick expansion. You cant tell me otherwise. I had more fun on timeless isle then should be allowed. 
---
Also SoO was one of the best raids blizzard ever made
---
warriors aren't bad at farming. some classes are certainly much better at farming, but that doesn't mean warriors are bad
---
Except for the fap and stun grenade...
---
you should just continue playing classic, try a tbc server if you're getting tired of vanilla.
---
I plan on going full resto.....I will be leveling a twink to get my PvP frustrations out though.
---
Uhh. No lol, a very good rogue will beat a good warrior in a 1v1 with all cds up. I used to shit on warriors with rags hammer. Rogue is NOT beginner friendly in these kind of fights. You can avoid the fights if you want which is beginner friendly but if you’re going to beat geared warriors 1v1 in pvp you need to know your shit. Exposure armor, rupture, vanish. Wait until last tick, cheap shot, backstab, gouge, backstab, kidney, repeat if pots used or needed and a ton of other variables. It’s extremely difficult to master in these type of fights. As far as a skill ceiling rogues are way above warriors.
---
*Excuse me*, we were also health stone and summoning machines and blamed for not putting up soulstones after every wipe.
---
The new models are hit and miss. I think all the Horde ones are pretty much better (Except removing the spooky skeleton face from female forsaken), but the Alliance suffered a bit with their humans and gnomes. Dwarves look great though.
---
And undead and orc running animation, that shits horrible.
---
Thanks my dude, it is good advice. At the current moment I have chosen warlock! But that could still probably change...
---
That's a different dungeon but still very odd and not very "wow" imo
---
Thrash Blade is trash. There are lots of other weapons you can use as dal rend's alternatives that will be better.
---
Right, I've seen so many posts on here asking if the community is going to be too toxic for new players...
---
Private servers are literally filled to the brim with people who have never played before and are just checking it out, leveling up some random toons. Just about every group I've been in, up to level 60 dungeons, has a tank who doesn't speak English and clearly does not know the dungeon or his class, a hunter with pet taunt on auto who keeps pulling when the healer is OOM, a healer who doesn't know to dispell sleep or manage mana, or a rogue who rolls need on every single piece of loot.
---
Hell, if we can make it through a dungeon like that, I'm not worried about new players at all. They'll be able to figure it out, and the dungeons aren't *that* hard, if we can make it through with some of the private servers groups I've been in, people on retail shouldn't have any issues.
---
You gotta get creative with that stuff. I PvP with a 1h and offhand so I can use skull of impending doom for polymorph. I can also stoneform viper sting and take an elixir of poision resistance. Pro tip i literally learned yesterday: elixir of poision resistance doesn't trigger your potion CD and can be used every 2-3 seconds.   Still though, if you are worried about mana in PvP, priest is the wrong choice. But I accept all of my brothers and sisters in the light, whether they are of the Silver Hand, or the Holy Order of the Northshire Clerics
---
I love the lore behind Gunther Arcanis or whatever his name is
---
That's not right. It was this way for a long time but nowadays every class can do everything. Everyone has stuns, everyone has dots, everyone has a little selfheal, everyone has damage mitigation or invincibility, everyone has a sprint, everyone has gap closers.
---
You can't possibly tell me that those things are even close to vanilla.
---
Cannonball runner trinket!
---
I don't mean costs on medical treatment. When one is ill, they can't work, but they still have to eat and pay rent.
---
Cooldown checks before raids will happen.
---
Very cool!
---
As though warriors don’t have them either? Like it’s not a guaranteed win for the warrior, but in a pvp scenario, warriors (with engi) have the tools needed to beat a hunter if skill is equal.
---
lol.. Fan favorite Easter egg is what you mean, right? Maybe some kids wanted to play as cute pandas, but I can't believe it was something people vehemently asked for like playing as Goblins, for example. Anyway, they could have added Pandaren in a village or something like that, but base an entire expansion around that race was lame.
---
Also, that trend of adding new playable races every now and then kinda sucks, when they added that bunch of allied races to the mix things got even worse. If they wanted updated looks on the main races they should have simply done that instead of shitting in the Lore and adding Dark Iron Dwarfs in the Alliance and inventing new Elven varieties, etc.
---
Retail WoW is clearly catting to the chinese MMO fans that like all those shine and flashy designed races, armors, mounts, etc.
---
Yeah I know it’s just a fun conversation. Everything looks different on paper...it’s why we play the game! /salute

Honestly just pvp until rank 11 lol
---
Ret paladin here I come
---
As a resto shaman I don't bother any more with ele/resto build. It's cool if you want to like farm silithus cultists, but hoary elemental summon will be close to imune to nature damage. Other elementals also varying. Plants for Argentyna dawn turn in resistant. mobs that drop greater nature protection potion recipe also with some resistance.
---
So i pumeled few of those recioe mobs as resto with shocks and melee. Sold excess recipes for around 150 then went fishing and herbing to make few hundred more... And I don't do aby DPS pvp. 
---
One of reasons for classic I'm going mage/druid or mage/shaman. Main for majority of activities and alt when healer/tank or healer are needed for something (plus extra professions slots).
---
I think the classic dressing room in the post above mine has that feature
---
not really, rogue is pretty easy. even if you don't know how to kite with crippling, cold blood eviscerate usually covers for any lack of skill. it's really not that hard to play rogue. warrior skill ceiling is way higher, even if you have bis you will still get mopped by certain classes.
---
i just said that, but its not because windfury its because lack of salvation.
---
100% the player matters more.
---
I am gonna be a feral druid so I know I need to bring my A game in order to pull my weight
---
I seriously miss hard Cata 5-mans. I think it's an extremely underrated time period and expansion, solely for this reason. I remember grim batol on heroic, or the ZG/ZA 5 man dungeon where you were on a timer and needed to mark/CC just about every pack to get through without wipes.
---
Honestly super fun, but then they nerfed it all to hell.
---
Thanks for the heads up. I want to make sure I'm working on these as early as possible. Really looking forward to raiding this time around.
---
Priests mages and warriors will be in high demand. This is even after you account for the larger population of mages and warriors. There might be twice as many mages on your server relative to hunters or druids but they get 4 times as many raid spots.
---
This isn’t going to be a international mega server in classic. People need to remember this.
---
Shaping of the world is where it's at. Track's so good it was never in the actual game.
---
Thanks so much.  The Holy Order of Northshire Clerics is taking tithe for anyone who would like to download it. Just forward them to Northshire Abbey.
---
Really? So if say 6 mages where channelling arcane missles, would a mob only be able to have 6 debuffs on it?
---
Yes. Hide helm and cloak was a thing back then.
---
Added in patch 1.2.
---
The truth is by Cataclysm, players were pretty much done with the 2-year rush of new expansions where all your work and progress were made obsolete.
---
I still remember being at a house party talking to players just as Wrath had come out. We were all excited for the third expansion but most of us agreed once another expansion comes out, we'd be done. Then we talked about Burning Crusade for the rest of the night.
---
It's sort of like Pokemon. For a lot of us, there's only 151 Pokemon and the rest are irrelevant. We came. We saw. We beat the original games. We moved on.
---
Yes, this is in 1.12 and the current 1.13 "beta" client
---
But with the 2hour loot trading in place, it might be safer looting everything myself, then trade it to the right person afterwards?
---
Hell yeah brother
---
Hunter: beats everything
---
Same goes for nightelves. An axe goes into two things, trees and nightelves.
---
Ninja looting that chest catapulted me into greatness lolll
---
But the new models have better ~~nipple~~ nude textures!
---
You prefer your tauren with a head that looks like a rectangle, and painted on panties?
---
MoP was the best expansion. You can’t change my mind.
---
I think both quests starts are called Dragonkin Menace and I believe they're both available at 54. The rest of the quest is different for each faction but I think they start the same.
---
LONG AMD AT 16.36
---
I've never understood why such a high pop class gets SO many spots. Is it the philosophy like warriors and how they are best melee dps in things like Naxx so take a lot?
---
They looked like Tauren, not furry direct-to-dvd offbrand lion king characters they look now.
---
I am the mighty paladin! Saviour of the light!

Atleast you know there are at least 1 million other people in the same boat as you.

Turn on the flags? So you're playing PVE?

This requires a GIF. Make it happen!

MM.... I still have my fully geared twink lvl 29 night elf hunter with the super fast attack lion "the rake" sitting on my deactivated account.
---
something like a +17 agil 2h sword with +25 agil on it.
---
are 1200+ aimed shot crits fair at lvl 29?
---
Whoever attacks first is favored.  Same with Rogue matchup.
---
&gt; I like how they look in ~~gear~~ plate bikini
---
It was such a hidden golden age.
---
Are they announced Russian servers?
---
Yeah Mythic plus is just not the same. Doing difficult dungeons is nice, but putting speedruning into them was an awful idea. Its fun to take it slow and making sure you do everything right because wiping will cost you more time than the time it took to plan it out.
---
I miss CCing mobs and taking it slow and actually following the mechanics instead of AOEing everything down and instantly resurrecting when you die.
---
Played a gnome rogue back then. Made it to like 46 before TBC came out. I never quested I just grinded mobs most of the time. 
---
This time around I’m going tauren shaman. Elemental PvP looks fun as hell

https://youtu.be/PZapYnHSSsQ

I think it's going to be fine. There will be more than just those 3 types of players. You will have more new players than any private server, so there will be fuck ups that happen. There will be both casuals and vets from retail that will have varying degrees of seriousness about raiding, and they will probably be figuring everything out for the first time. There will be veterans that haven't played since TBC and Vanilla. I imagine those will be the chillest players, as they tend to treat the game more nostalgically and are open to bringing new players into that nostalgia.
---
The final segment (though there are many others) is the private server community. Even those guys aren't as leet as they'd have you believe. I'll use WotLK pservers, because that is what I am experienced. I've had 4 80 h pallies from retail through 3 separate private servers. The amount of h pallies that fail to use JoL is astounding. In the portion that does, the people who use JoL on fights like Patchwerk 25 that fuck the raid is just as astounding. Not everyone on a private server is a pro, and even on private servers you can find people with your mindset.
---
Don't worry. You will be fine.
---
I think you meant that is there going to be a point where people will try speedrunning things as meme specs as your raid composition as a new tryhard kind of thing.
---
Yeah I used to play private servers but I’m holding off until classic releases to be fresh for the grind.
---
"Looked like tauren"
---
Questionable, at best.
---
I don't think you quite understand the game Blizzard was making.
---
FWIW i started in Wrath and there were still PLENTY of Naxx/Ulduar/ToC raids after the next tier came out.  Yes, the added heroics and whatever helped you gear up, but odds were you still were going to pug the older raids to get more chances at loot, and some chances at things that were BIS the previous tier, and often still either very good or BIS in the next tier.
---
You also werent going to fill every slot by running through ToC, so at some point you had to get gear elsewhere.  Yes, badge gear was a thing, but iirc when ToC was out there wasnt a whole lot of 'new' valor gear, so a lot of the slots you could buy were still only 200/213 ilvl.  Ulduar dropped 226 on 25m IIRC, so it was more than worth it to run.
---
Also, maybe its because i was still newer to the game at the time and raids were...idk...mystical...., but plenty of people ran them just to see the content, or because...*gasp*...they *enjoyed* raiding.
---
Ive actually been doing some thinking about that recently, and i still havent decided if i dont enjoy raiding as much, or if i just flat out dont enjoy the raid content itself (in modern Retail).  Im really leaning towards the latter.  Nostalgia is always something thats hard to gauge, but i really, really just enjoy those Wrath raids *so* much more.  Maybe i just know a bit more about the lore and that makes it more enjoyable, but i think a lot of it is things were just...idk...more straight-forward at the time.  Less annoying bullshit in the fights, less RNG (in the mechanics, loot is a whole different issue), things were visually spectacular (and epic!).
---
I should say that i did all of that on a Medium pop server that wasnt really great in the PvE department (when looking at realm rankings) even back in Wrath.  Things were likely much better on higher pop servers, and when i moved to Kel'Thuzad in Cata they definitely were.
---
Ive been trying to get back to pugging raids, and i really just cant figure out why i dont.  A lot of it is flat out the community.  I used to pug shit and we'd wipe, but whatever.  Maybe you'd have a leaver or three, but overall people just wanted to kill the boss.  You talked about the mechanics, were probably in vent from the start, etc.
---
Maybe some of that is that the mechanics were easier at the time, and maybe i just prefer that.  I dunno.
---
Some of it is probably that aesthetically i'd rather spend a few hours in Ulduar than anything in BfA, though even Naxx/ICC were preferable to the new raids for me.  Hell, i probably had more fun in ToC than the newer raids...and thats saying something.
---
Wow, this got kind of long winded.  I should get back to work...
---
For healers it’s the chain that leads to Fordring’s Seal. That ring is so OP, you basically can’t replace it until you get BOTH Cauterizing Band and Pure Elementium Band, if you only have one or the other you’ll still need Fordring’s in the other slot. And good luck getting even one of them, with low drop rate and every healer needing them.
---
Yes, this. The artstyle from WC:OaH through WCIII through to WoW had a consistent grounding in the sketches of Chris Metzen which gave it a unique stylized look that was more graphic novel than Pixar. The new art has lost that grounding, and has become far too cartoony, especially with some of the animations and emotes, to the point that it doesn’t look like WC anymore. The art in Hearthstone has gone even farther down this road.
---
there are at least 1 million people doing hard drugs right now as well
---
I can't find any buffs to Arcane missiles in the patch notes spanning 2.x, only bugfixes.
---
Tot/soo mop and dragon soul shadowpriest were the best we’d ever been. 
---
Pretty sure feral druids were super complex too.
---
Mop warlocks were by far the best they’d ever been.
---
Rogues I think had their hay day in Wrath? 
---
I dunno every class/spec, but I spent a lot of time in heroic raids in mop—people were a hell of a lot more satisfied with that content than Cata. Like usual the least satisfying boss was the untested, hidden heroic only Ra Den. 
---
I raided hardcore from mc to siege of orgrimmar, I haven’t played the game seriously since—maybe that’s why I enjoy mop. But I enjoyed the art, the fresh story, my class mechanics (priest, lock alt: RIP Dot snapshotting), the raids. The unique cloak was novel and the daily grind (after the first few months of doing everything every day) was your farm, I liked challenge modes and the lock quest.
---
Tot island and whatever that misted island was called were cool returns to that island of quel Danas thing. 
---
Finally, the new talent system is actually really good from a gameplay standpoint. As much as I like talent trees when leveling. At max level in current wow, the current system is amazing. Having multiple viable plaustyles in a given spec allows for choice and decision making, the fact that some combos perform better on certain bosses or PvP comps the better. It introduces a whole new level of game knowledge. 
---
In Bc/Wrath we had talents and occasionally you’d Just not be the right spec and need to go to town. Or if you’re in PvP specced v melee but it’s a caster comp. modern WoW, long before new talents were introduced stopped being about rpg and your character and started being performance driven and encounter based. 
---
I like the way they released the first tier, spacing it out so I had a few weeks of lower intensity raiding while I was blasting through all the world stuff. Heroic lei shen, siegecrafter, Garrosh, spirit kings, and the first boss of heart of fear (pre nerf) were insane.
---
lol nice, Glimmering mythical insignia. Nice to see someone else appreciate that item for how gnarly it is.
---
the 'meta' already implies minmaxing, and this wont shift due to the nochanges autists winning. if anything, more people these days are aware of how to properly build your character (compared to originally when only the high end raiders cared), so youll likely see less off-meta specs out there. the game is also ancient and has been theorycrafted probably entirely; its extremely unlikely that someone will discover This One Cool Trick that makes balance druids worthy at this stage
---
that said, regular raiding guilds will be able to beat current content with off specs, theres just a few limitations (eg fire mages in MC). if you pick a bad spec you just have to be aware that you are gimped compared to the usual suspects, but if you like spec enough it doesnt matter (outside of pvp)
---
Mages get mad gains lugging spellbooks around and drinking conjured protein shakes all day. Sounds like someone’s jealous.
---
You’d be surprised with a 40 man raid I’m sure I’ll need this beast to keep over 144 FPS and utilize my 144 hz monitor. I’m def gonna need to get tougher if I am to survive phase 2!
---
I'll second Grim Dawn. I bought in early access and even then it was extremely fun. So many character combos you can create. Very replayable. Been meaning to go back and see what content has been added. I think I last played after the gauntlet content came out.
---
Thanks for all your comments guys, appreciate it!
---
Not talking about change for Classic but for future games or expansions, as in hopefully they will realise that with the succes of Classic.
---
You are the only class with a defensive dispel magic on the horde side besides warlocks who r dispelling through felhunter which isn’t a good substitute at all. Priests are vital to hordes success in pvp. I also think it’s one of the only classes that make troll an appealing choice for all content pvp and pve. I like the shadow balls.
---
Did someone say [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]?
---
and they're idiots, because they could be getting hyped for Classic for free.
---
I wish we could hide the hideous NE ears too... If not, I am going to wear Rocket Helmet for eternity lol.
---
I leveled a Shadow Priest 1-60, and respeccing Shadow Form at 40 worked great for me. Huge boost in DPS, and because of Spirit Tap, I never had to drink. I’d only use water when healing dungeons. My next 5 points went into wands, then I went for improved PW:S. Mana was never an issue as Shadow, I’d generally hover around 85% mana unless I was gonna stop grinding, I’d use it all up killing a bunch of stuff.
---
I'm that kid please send money

I used to the braids myself, I'm from a celtic country so I've always been drawn to stuff like that. Even made a backstory for the character since Stromgarde reminds me of the Highlands but when they updated the models the braids were injected with super steroids. The beard I was using at the time in particular makes me think of hair from 1970s adult movie.
---
Monkeynews begs to differ, check out his videos on YouTube
---
Yeah its mage, it's always mage. 
---
Paladin may significantly worse at aoe farming for classing, if sitting down for reck stacks might not work and on private servers Seal of Light procs from every auto attack, which is not blizzlike. 
---
mage mage mage.
---
i think the massive vanilla dungeons are better though, literally gnomer and dire maul are legitimately the same size of leveling zones.
---
You are only looking at total experienced gained, not experienced gained per time spent. 
---
You do "kill x" quests three times as fast in a 3-person group, getting three times (or however much it is) less experience for the mobs even that out. But you still get full experience from the quest, while spending a third of the time, making it a net positive. 
---
Drop quests has in ideal circumstances the same efficiency in a group as alone. You kill things three times as fast, but also has to kill three times as much. Quest xp remains the same. 
---
Only time it's bad to group up is if you for whatever reason can't multiply your party's kill speed that way. Maybe if there are limited amounts of mobs or something like that, but even in that case, you would still presumably be competing against the other players for the spawns available, so it wouldn't matter in the end anyway. 
---
&gt; It's generally best to save grouping for group quests if you want to be really efficient or only group up for quests where you'll be killing a bunch of extra enemies anyway).
---
Depends on your class, warriors for example gain a lot from grouping with a healer. Being able to reliably cleave, and not having to stop to eat massively increases the warrior's own effectiveness. And the healer gains a lot in return from grouping with someone with considerably higher killing power than themselves. 
---
&gt;As in like 9 levels worth over the course of 1-60 if you grouped the whole way
---
Yeah, but you would complete the same quests a lot faster if you grouped the whole way, so you would be able to easily make up for the 9 levels of lost mob-xp by grinding mobs outside of quests.
---
This is so good. I tried to return to WoW during MoP after skipping all of Cata (I left because, well, LFG/LFR and flying mounts had essentially made the game boring).
---
During TBC, even though the lore was a little screwy like you mention, and the Dreanai were difficult to accept - especially as playable characters - I thought maybe Blizzard was going somewhere with it. Even little oddities like SSC being in Outland instead of in the Well of Eternity could be sorta explained by one thing or another. (I mean, from reading the books I thought it was the Old Gods who supposedly rescued Princess Azshara from death in the well, which was implied as a portal to the realm they had been locked away in by the Titans, so finding her on a world with all of the demons didn’t quite make logical sense, among other things... (but maybe that’s just me). However, the raids were fun, inventive, and while PvP was broke (thanks arenas and ridiculous gear) overall the expansion was pretty good. Yet the PvP was enough to make me think twice about WoTLK.
---
Then in WoTLK, the amazing lore was pretty much back, and I loved the game. It was kinda hard to leave the game then, but as I mentioned, it just lost “something” with all the extra bells and whistles (not to mention how annoying gs was, and suddenly everyone was an expert on what you should be doing...)
---
So I was done. Then MoP. It looked odd. But I was bored, so I tried to come back. What I found was complete nonsense. How you describe the “Easter egg” was brilliant. THIS was the REAL “you think you do, but you don’t!” Moment of WoW! It was everything you hoped it would be, but also everything you knew you didn’t want. It was silly. It was nonsense. It was a racial affront. It was a stretch - even the opposition didn’t make sense. There was no sense of community based off of a culture with the strongest communal sense ever in the known history of the world.
---
...and Kung-fu panda didn’t help - it ruined any chance this expansion might have had. It was from that point forward, completely unoriginal. I can’t say enough about how bad pandas were/are. I have zero desire to ever return to retail, or ever play any game with any chance to ever run into a panda character in any capacity.
---
It was completely unplayable and I couldn’t justify paying any cost to continue. And for the record, I never met ANY player who actually wanted pandas as a playable class. I knew one guy who thought it might be cool to see the lore developed, and always pointed out the good parts of MoP, but even he didn’t play them.
---
There’s already some made: https://m.imgur.com/gallery/EqXH0FM
---
The new Tauren are a travesty, and orcs lost a lot of variety in their face styles. Trolls and undead fared okay. Overall I wish they had just increased the resolutions of the old textures and not “reimagined” the designs.
---
AoE farming, yes mage.
---
DM farming? Hunter running tribute.
---
Til ZG croc farm, hunter is far superior in farming gold.
---
They were probably pretty bad yeah. Was 30/21 feral/resto in vanilla and I honestly can not remember ever loosing a 1vs1 against a mage and I don't think full resto, feral or balance would make much difference. Rogues and hunters with good gear were tough as hell and I think a lock with felhound could be pretty nasty, but all mages were free.
---
It has shifted more and more toward that, I'll give you that.  But I think classes still excel at different roles despite some homogenization.
---
Gotta do Mara.  Mark of the chosen is an incredible trinket while soloing.  Basically permanent 25 Stan/str/agi.  Free thrash blade or staff too.  Also, fun.
---
I recommend kingdom come deliverance as well. I need to get back in on that game. It’s pretty epic. I am just not that drawn to single player games.
---
For AOE nothing is really comparable to a mage, mostly because of their ability to keep mobs at a distance while they are burned down. Other classes have decent aoe abilities, but without that control they are never going to be as effective.
---
this is literally literally me, even down to the same class
---
Okay well then my list is trash and should be ignored then.
---
The first 10-20 lvls aren’t bad.  But it’s gets worse over time.  You don’t have much downtime if you play right but they are pretty much the second slowest class just ahead of warriors.
---
There's virtually no gear for fury warriors in MC, you better get those truestrike shoulders if you want to do any dps
---
Frost mage is fantastic
---
Yeah thats actually the best idea if the 2hour loot trading makes it in. 
---
If you're really min maxing you can just loot everything yourself and give it out after the raid if you finish in under 2 hours.

afking at the auction house is the most superior way of farming gold
---
Yes, but we can still agree that MoP was shit.
---
my bad dude, I was a grumpalump when I responded to you
---
didn't realize this was when the gear was easy to get
---
The Mechanical Chicken quests obviously.
---
That's a fair way to go about it too.

Bubble wand leveling and as a dwarf you’re basically guaranteed a raid spot
---
More facial features during emotes is a bad thing? Oookkaayyy... Tauren males look almost the same in their stock stance.
---
I know modern WoW gets a ton of criticism, especially on this subreddit, but MoP and Legion proved that type of MMO can work.
---
&gt;or would say perhaps a prot paladin with their survivability edge out the mage in this particular farming method
---
No. Paladins suck at farming. Mages are definitely better in just about every situation. Paladins *can* aoe farm, and it's good for *them*, but it's not good objectively compared to other classes. As far as AoE goes, it's the mages.
---
I could see that happening in the more hardcore guilds for sure.
---
None of the guilds seemed to speak up about promises being undelivered from the research I did on their individual websites, so draw from that whatever conclusion you want.
---
The benefit I mentioned also doesn't actually seem that hard to provide since it was undefined in scope and could've very well been just a single 10 minute skype session with a designer for each of the 5 guilds. There wouldn't have been a good reason they couldn't have provided that as a one-off thing.
---
I don't doubt that they could've been lying, but outside of contact one of the guilds involved or shuffling through archives for hours, I see no way of definitively knowing.
---
[Song of Elune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhhvWeXHjP0) always brings me back.
---
Trying to decide between pally and priest for this reason.  I know they play pretty differently so are you just saying that because of the offensive potential of priests?  My biggest concern is getting trained by melee and vipersting
---
The tauren got very Banjo-Kazooie like if I recall. I agree though, the models tend to be 'graphically' better, but they lost a ton of style and the personality of the old models. I could rant for a while on the human female faces I was fond of which ended up getting butchered.
---
Thanks. This is really good news. I'd resigned myself to playing priest as that's the only other class I've really loved but have always preferred melee. I'm back to rolling warrior!
---
;)
---
That's pretty rad. O_o Now I know why there was that thread a while ago about wanting everyone to roll tonguedead...
---
Assuming equal skill ofc u rat
---
ToT and Timeless Isle was peak wow for me
---
I mean they are different and I miss those too, but cata dungeons were low key insanely fun. I'd grind through them multiple times per day as a tank, not even for any gear but just because I thought they were so much fun to play. The mechanics were well designed and very punishing.
---
since most of horde is undead i'd argue the reason people don't appreciate it is because they already have it at level 1.
---
People who often criticize people playing humans often don't bother to read the lore, or that's the general rule of thumb. Some of the best roleplayers I've met played humans and worst typically placed the more exotic races.
---
That's fair. I was just thinking about for the fun of pvp and not so much farming. But that's a valid point. Tho I will prolly do a lot of gathering and fishing for gold. And having 2 characters setup like that is prolly a good idea as well.
---
I once convinced a guy priests did not have access to a rez after letting him die, because he pissed me off so much.
---
I employ the afk at the Org bank strat but my gold output is significantly higher than my gold input with this method.
---
MC attunement is barely a quest but Onyxia is a real grind. At least it’s fun to do.
---
&gt;Some people may feel an over saturation of asian themes if they ya, for some reason play Korean MMOs, but I bet lets of people feel the same about the Western Medieval/High Fantasy saturation of most Western games. 
---
Eh, variety is the spice of life. The cool thing about Warcraft is the way it uses cultures from all over the world. If we can accept an extremely norse expansion pack with Wrath, then an asian one should be just as aceptable, imo.
---
As a private server hero, I'm looking forward to the thrill of leading a group of new people through the mazes within Sunken Temple. Theres nothing more boring to me than silently smashing my way through a dungeon while everyone in the group tries to have as little social interaction as possible. I would love nothing more than to hope into discord with 4 random people and strategize our way through the dungeon, laughing when we wipe instead of swearing at the person who caused it. 
---
Dungeons and group questing with friends are what I'm looking forward to most in classic.

* 22 Points in Prot without picking up ANYTHING useful is legitimately amazing
---
* Stopped at 16 points in Fury, next point would improve the end result no matter what
---
* Remaining points in Arms
---
Deliberately avoided putting points in Imp. Demo Shout (since a dedicated TC/Demo warrior might actually be more helpful to a raid than, say, an Oomkin). 1/5 Tactical Mastery ensures this build has no use as a Utility/Flag Carrier role in PvP. 
---
I could see maybe moving 1-2 points from Deflection to Improved Battleshout. I also thought about putting the Toughness points into Shield Specialization, but I decided that would benefit 5man tanking more than it would hurt raid tanking.
---
Think about it the other way around, you can get UD racial in a trinket, can't do the same for orc/tauren/troll.
---
Why? Does the high simulate what it's like to play vanilla or something?
---
i dunno was just a statement lol
---
create your own goals
---
Does raid tanking require MCP's?
---
If I choose not to farm MCP's, what other weapons are BiS for feral tank/dps?
---
It may be low enough priority they will push each other off but after pushing 1 other debuff off the damage is done. The debuff does not need to stay on.
---
I don't believe Echoes of the Past was in the game either until Caverns of Time opened up in BC.
---
Haha I’ve been listening to the original Warcraft soundtrack all morning, it’s so good
---
You should check if the guy that made the "All the Things" addon is planning to make something similar for classic, probably the next best thing.
---
Yeah and the good old Orgrimmar music. I love it.

How is everyone getting any work done?  I need a youtube channel or twitch stream I can listen to that is SLLOOOWWWW progressing so I can let it run for hours like a WoW IV drip. A

[There will be no achievement system in Classic.](https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=2065)
---
10% haste, axe expertise, and a 1 second stun
---
Don't think so because of cast time
---
I have to completely disagree. MoP was like the first expansion they REALLY pushed storytelling and narrative. Every single patch there was a shit ton of quests that progressed the story forward with characters receiving equitable development. 
---
We didn't really see that before MoP.
---
Can trade in raids, the perfect system
---
Source?
---
I suppose it could happen, but it's unlikely since there's no way to predict where the campfire will spawn.
---
People will probably jump on this comment and say "they always spawn to the left of your character," or somesuch,  but that's just not true. Maybe that's how they work on private servers, but campfire roulette has always been a thing on official servers.
---
I've been role-playing on WoW for as long as I can remember. Let me tell you, even when you thought you had it down, you could never quite predict where or how the campfire would spawn. Sometimes it would even pop out behind you.
---
Picture it. You're role-playing with your guild. It's night. You're telling ghoulish stories around a campfire. Suddenly, blackness. The campfire de-spawns.
---
"I've got this," you say (out-of-character, of course), as you hop up to place another fire.
---
"It always spawns to the left," you recall. "But only on a full-moon, and you have to be a Pisces otherwise it won't work." You try to aim it - a little to the left, a little to the right, and...
---
Fuck.
---
The campfire spawns somewhere completely random - behind you, in fact - and now the entire group has to awkwardly reposition to compensate. You notice pink text in your chatbox. It's the Guild Leader. You've lost your position as the guild's resident "campfire guy". Now you're just regular old "guy". You sit back down, defeated.
---
"Fucking campfires," you think (out-of-character, of course).
---
Ok I see your point. I suppose it remains to be seen, depending on how successful classic is. I can't help but feel like games are trending towards the Instant Gratification design, which I despise. But I hope you're right!
---
Wheel my crookedy-ass up with yours then and we'll blast it (because of the hearing loss at that age, surely).
---
The quest that gives the Rune of the Guard Captain trinket in the Hinterlands is a must for any physical dps. That's the horde item, I believe there's an Alliance equivalent.
---
What. Nobody waits for full pre-bis before they enter a raid. If they were to do so they'd've completely missed the point of getting pre-bis gear. It's just that 40 man raiding means there is a lot of competition for each gear piece so you need to get pre-bis because it's the best possible upgrade that isn't locked behind weekly RNG loot pinatas.
---
It's also a handy benchmark that allows someone to see that there is a person who's going to earn their keep. If I see a Hunter in full pre-raid bis wearing Cape of the Black Baron, Hand of Justice, Blackcrow, Mask of the Unforgiven etc. within a month or two of launch I know that he's actually worked his ass off to get that gear because those items are insanely contested. As a prospective recruiter, if I inspect a person wearing that kind of gear shortly after launch that alone tells me more about them as a person and raider than almost anything else they could say and do.
---
I'm too from bulgaria, and I can say stuff here is very, very bad. I'd say its the worst country to live in besides maybe Moldova, but even that I'm not sure. I'm 16 years old and the way me and my brother are going to play the game is by me making enough money from my programming skills. The only way to earn good money here is by the internet and nothing else.
---
I know, I was trying to make the joke that playing vanilla is better than getting high.
---
I was there but the story isn’t a great one.  I spent a lot of time farming and leveling alts when we weren’t raiding.  We just avoided the plague
---
"Live, laugh, love."
---
Sad emoji
---
That sounds interesting! Thanks a lot!
---
It's mostly party coordination. A full dungeon set equiped group should be able to do it but a few choice Onyxia and MC parts do wonders. Our first guildrun was with 2 warlocks and a holy paladin + feral +defwarrior. it was basically the tryhard party. No mana issues and buffed to the gills with potions/food = 3 minutes left. 
---
If you are really serious you can spend a fortune in potions and holy water/grenades to cheese it. You basically only need a tank and healer for bosses then.
---
There's going to be no extra purchase tho...just your subscription. It's not like buying the base game or an expac.
---
It's more than 10% attack and casting speed, if your missing hp. If that was a trinket it would be the best trinket in the game by far.
---
You can't get axe skill in a trinket but the stun resist for pvp is more useful, which you can't get from any item in the game.
---
You can get a 3sec stun from Tidal Charm as a trinket, but you can't get an AOE stun. And Tidal Charm doesn't give you 5% hp.
---
Azshara didn't have any questing in vanilla, did it?
---
stun resist is a low chance and also made useless by the fact that every race is spams 50 living action potions and is immune to stun lategame
---
huh really?  its not exactly rocket science
---
druid, imo, is the ultimate duelling class.  maybe not sooo great in group pvp cos it doesnt bring huge burst or the best healing, or something like blessing of freedom, but they ofc carry flags etc
---
I think some of it is nostalgia (and there's nothing wrong with that - shit, I *fucking love* BWL and AQ40 despite knowing the fights were mechanically crazy-simple), some of its definitely changed raid design. A lot of BFA (and Legion, and even WoD)-era fights have, as you said, "annoying bullshit", which is getting more and more common as Blizzard makes more complex fights. And I don't think there's anything wrong with that, but it does change the atmosphere of the raid when you can't kill a dragon without having to play some in-fight mini-game while dodging shit on the floor, *for the entire fight*. Old raids had much longer periods where you could "relax" between mechanics and just focus on DPSing/healing/rotating defensives.
---
TBH, I think the pug community has basically gone to shit. Its a little better if you're exclusively pugging heroics, but the ease of pugging via the LFG tool and the massive pool of players (Since all realms are connected) means there's very little reason to "stick it out" with a group that's having even moderate trouble. For the most part, in Wrath and Cata, if your group was struggling you were more incentivized to just stick around and struggle with them, since finding a new pug likely wasn't going to happen that night. Now? If your group is struggling, you can drop, find a new group, and continue your raiding *much faster*.
---
I like the fact that WoD is so bad you didn't even rank it.
---
Lady Vashj was the boss of SSC not Azshara
---
Why not both ;). I’m planning to play ally warrior and horde shammy.
---
hm?
---
That still doesn't change the fact that Tourists are their own species lol. Expect them to disappear reasonably fast after launch.
---
It had some, but the combination of relatively sparse quests &amp; annoying geography (god help you if you fell down one of the cliffs far from a ramp back up) made it less than enjoyable for most.
---
https://discord.gg/9EKEePz
---
All class discords.
---
It had a couple of questlines but not many
---
I really like Darkshore and Barrens, just heavy quests you can knock out a ton in one day and feel like you really got alot done, without even looking at your experience bar.
---
Swapping a shaman into a healer group for the Mana Tide is defo worth.
---
Not many afaik and the level got changed iirc.. changed lower before flex leveling became a thing
---
Best one

Heh, I was thinking of setting up a 'Webcam" in the Crossroads but that would technically make me a filthy streamer.
---
Still, might just do it.
---
Are tourist people who didn’t play Vanilla? I’ve got a few friends who’re going to be playing classic who have never even played wow before.
---
yes and no, if you want a pre 1.4 no armor epic mount, questing is the only way
---
But the flute.
---
STV is not a relaxing place it is pure evil
---
 &gt;None of the guilds seemed to speak up about promises being undelivered from the research I did on their individual websites, so draw from that whatever conclusion you want.

or vice versa.

&gt;The benefit I mentioned also doesn't actually seem that hard to provide since it was undefined in scope and could've very well been just a single 10 minute skype session with a designer for each of the 5 guilds.
---
If there was only 5 guilds, that would seem incredibly small with how broad the requirements are. 
---
idk, this seems like an incredibly lackluster program thats more PR than impact
---
So long as some of your healers are specced right—and everyone knows how to play well—you can afford a few “pvp” spec healers in the raid for mc/ony and bwl once it’s on farm
---
Hunter. Warrior. Priest.
---
I've played both classes on pservers and am genuinely asking if there is anything the warrior can do if the hunter gets the drop on them, unmounted, at max range? I've tried the Mn strat of trying to kite the hunter until you get a lucky charge off but it just doesn't work against anyone competent. I never even got in intercept range against good hunters. If I got the opener on them with charge and either ice reflector'd or pet taunted the trap, it was just me vs a hunter in melee range and obviously the warrior is going to crush in that scenario.
---
I just can't wait the posts where people rage on forums because they gave up at lvl 5.
---
Tanking with MCPs is only needed for TPS heavy fights - e.g. BWL: Vaelstrasz / Broodlord Lashlayer AQ40: Twin Emps - where you need to build a lot of threat within a short amount of time.
---
For Tanking is also the difference to make: is it a mitigation fight, where you need a lot of survivability? Or do you actually need the additional threat?
---
Mitigation wise: Warden Staff (43 World Drop) will be BiS the entire vanilla content for you. Unyielding Maul (DM Tribute) does almost the same job is just slightly supbar stat-wise.
---
Threat (additional Attackpower in Feral):
---
Those Weapons will only come with the Green Dragons and after. There are like 4 Weapons overall (beside Atiesh) with AP in Feral Form. They'll increase your DMG only slightly though, so it wont matter too much.
---
BiS is the Hammer from the AQ40 Armament Token - has a lot AP paired with Stam&amp;Armor. (You can switch to Warden Staff during the fight as soon as you have enough threat).
---
For DPS you'll look for one of those +AP weapons (here as well the one from AQ40 BiS)
---
&gt; respeccing Shadow Form at 40 worked great for me
---
It does not mean that other specs don't even work better. Have you tried speccing into holy for quicker smite cast times? Did you use Holy Fire?
---
&gt; because of Spirit Tap, I never had to drink
---
You have spirit tap in the 13/0/5 base as well so that is nothing new. And if you never had to drink, chances are you were being inefficient (which is fine, but we are making a discussion of efficiency).
---
Proper rotations depend on a lot of things, but once you are Shadow your best options are usually to just Mind Flay about three times. In some situations you want to use rank 1 spells to ramp up one or two stacks of shadow weaving (especially while getting into range you can use r1 SWPs). You want to finish with a downranked Mind Flay.
---
SWP is almost always bad. If you take 15 seconds to kill a mob, then you don't deal enough damage.
---
Mind Blast can be O.K.
---
Wanding should no longer be done once you go deep shadow as low rank Mind Flays are just better.
---
Yes, you can SWP, Mind Blast and Mind Flay then wand them to death and take 15 seconds to kill every mob. Or you kill them in less than 10 seconds and still sustain mana.
---
Not trying to tell you how to play. But I tried every different spec throughout and I also raced to 60 before.
---
Just get lucky and personally know 5 people who plan on starting a raiding guild.
---
Just roll the gnome master race.  Problem solved.
---
Hahahahah veryyyy narrow.  Thanks for that man
---
I agree but if your healers are actually running oom they're overhealing. 95% of the time.
---
Feign Death + Shadow Meld + Drink/Eat
---
Öhm.. why not both? :)
---
I mean druid can run flags in WSG...but yeah they are a master of none.
---
I agree. The internet is very different now. You used to be able to talk trash in about any game, now you get banned for "toxicity" because everyone needs a "safe environment".
---
With the proper gear you could. You'll have to manage your rage well and your threat will be significantly lower. Warriors can tank with any spec because all of the specs are *somehow* increasing threat.
---
But I would recommend you to get at least 11 points in feral for feral charge. A lot of Druids do that, especially PvPer. Noone will fault you when you go for a flag carrier build like this:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zL0hZxxzoZVgcoeq0o
---
It is a healer build with swiftmend that still has feral charge, which is a very important spell for PvP and tanking.
---

&gt; Your little "Comparison" doesn't actually show much &gt;\_&gt; Besides how tauren *used* to look when graphics sucked. 
---
The middle picture is vanilla tauren. FYI.
---
Yeah you can do one princess run for Thresh Blade and ~ 10k extra XP. Sooner or later you want to farm the ring anyway depending on how they will do progression.
---
A full run might not be worth it depending on context. People need to decide that themselves. It's a bit like raiding before reaching raids. Some people love it, others hate it.
---
every tourist is going to roll blood elf
---
I know it had a few quests, I just meant it wasn't an area you went and "quested".
---
new players are wanted and welcomed, but tourists look more like [this.](https://i.redd.it/htqu0347xwj11.jpg) they haven't played classic, but are going to give it a try only to b*tch about it.
---
A mage is good class. They start strong get stronger with gear. I still find them a bit boring to level as a lot of it is stand there and watch your cast bar.  
---
As for talent trees frost is strong in all situations. Fire gets really strong for raiding, but not great for farming. It's pretty fun in AV were you can stand still long enough to throw down some fireballs and 2 shot people. Arcane mages are rare. My thought is they could use a better damage spell than arcane missiles to make it viable. You tend to go into that tree for specific things like clear casting and presence of mind.
---
By then, we will hopefully be too busy playing WoW and hopefully never visit Reddit ever again. :D
---
You can never have enough crit as arms.
---
Tourists are going to be the ones who check Classic out, but who might not play long term.
---
yeah i was in that phase... and now I'm completely obsessed... i wish i was in that phase still haha... WHEN IS THIS COMING OUT UGHHGHHGH
---
I think people are over-valuing the "meta" in classic in relation to it's total lifespan. At the start of the game, and at the release of each raid tier, there will be a lot of focus on min-maxing and efficient raid composition- as guilds get hardcore about completing the content.  HOWEVER... there will be PLENTY of guilds out there that aren't racing to complete content and will be playing with raid compositions that aren't aimed at min-maxing. Especially as the months progress, people get geared up, and casual players reach 60, you'll start to see the number of casual and semi-casual guilds explode. Something I've seen other people mention in forums here and there, that a lot of people seem to forget is that we are all a LOT better at the game now than people were in 2006. Raid mechanics in classic will not be as complicated/challenging as the stuff that people who have been playing since Wotlk and onwards have been exposed to. Many people have had 10+ years to get better at the game, whereas in 2006 the most time you had was 3 years, and that's with minimal exposure to challenging raid mechanics (compared to the dozens of raids that people who have been playing 10+ years have exposure to). My point is that even at semi-casual pace, with average gear, people will be able to complete the raids. Classic's raids won't REQUIRE minmaxing composition or gear to complete (though they'll certainly benefit from it). I'm certainly not saying that classic's raids will be raid-finder level of easy either though, some effort will be required. But a 100% min-maxed group will not be required to complete content 6-months in. If you want to be downing Ragnaros with your guild soon after release, then yeah, you might need to pick a specific class &amp; spec to make that happen. But if you're comfortable taking your time, grinding out 5mans, leveling alts, pvping, etc. Then by the time we're a few raid tiers/6months in, you should have no problem finding a group that will accept your wacky experimental builds. Remember that leveling takes so long in classic that you're basically stuck with whatever race/class you choose. You might get an alt up to 60, or maybe 2 if you are hardcore, but ultimately, your character choice really matters. You gotta get that right. The most important part of "getting it right" is picking something you'll have fun playing. So ALWAYS prioritize that first.
---
I think I’m one of the few that left ICC whelmed. Granted I had already quit by then and came back just for a few weeks a sight seeing, so I missed the progression aspect, but I was also far more interested in the lore behind the Titans than I was in Arthas and the Lich King arc.
---
I "secretly" raided as 30/0/21 on my shaman.  They did wonder why I was casting chain lightning instead of chain heal, lol.  Hey no one died.
---
in classic you wear your achievements
---
&gt; Even little oddities like SSC being in Outland instead of in the Well of Eternity could be sorta explained by one thing or another. (I mean, from reading the books I thought it was the Old Gods who supposedly rescued Princess Azshara from death in the well, which was implied as a portal to the realm they had been locked away in by the Titans, so finding her on a world with all of the demons didn’t quite make logical sense, among other things... (but maybe that’s just me).
---
Wrong Naga. Vashj was the one that met with Kael in TFT and went to Outland with him, and was the boss of SSC.Naga Azshara still hasn't even shown up yet.
---
Balance.
---
I'm genuinely envious of those that already have their classes and faction decided already.
---
You're in the wrong subreddit for that opinion lol. Not sure if many here will agree with you.
---
I can't stand the new models, I don't care if they have a trilliion more pixels. I understand updating them as technology has advancements, but not allowing me to use the old ones on retail is laughable. The old models just feel like home and look way more serious and badass, less flappy and goofy.  
---
I love classic but if the only option was to play with new models I'd prolly give runescape a try.
---
Ah. Well I did, struggling to find any quests at that point though. Seems like it might be worth a decent chunk of XP if you show up at level 52 and do them all. The quests were kind of unique too. Teleporting up mountains and stuff.
---
Ahh yeah I couldn’t remember if the raid tiers were WotLK. I hated that with a passion. I liked the way Ulduar approached it. Unlock hard modes via gameplay.
---
Depends on what exactly you mean. Horde Ferals don't profit as much from Shamans as Alliance Ferals from Paladins. But the Horde profits just as much from Ferals as Alliance does if not more, because horde has more threat issues.
---
lmao at this image
---
I think when most people talk about “tourists” they are usually referring to folks that are not really interested in Classic, but want to check it out when it releases anyways to see what all the fuss is about. They’ll be a substantial part of the population in Classic in the first few weeks but most of them will likely drop out before ever reaching level 20.
---
I’m pretty sure most druids run a hybrid build. They live up to their jack of all trades in PvP.
---
&gt; What you'll save in food cost gets absolutely destroyed by the cost of teleport and portal runes, though
---
Compared to paying for flightpaths or paying someone else for portals? :P
---
True, too much work for me fam I’ll take the armor 😂
---
i think the trading of soulbound items and battlenet integration are pretty small details that will have a big change on the game. also i'm assuming the updated shadows and waters are turned on by default so not everybody will know to turn them off.
---
Imagine if it changed voices into racial voices.  Youd just have some mad orc shouting zug zug at you.
---
Sounds to me like youre just arguing semantics. Which is utterly pointless given there is no agreed upon standards of what is good or bad. So lets just say that at literally every point in the game warrior is one of the worst farming classes.
---
I'm not looking for agreement, just wanting to share so maybe some people who get misled by the front page post will have a better comparison to reference.
---
Their definitely should be a toggle if they want to include the new stuff. I would never be okay with forcing people to use new textures and models when they're trying to get their nostalgia.
---
Not everything was fire immune in mc/bwl. I think most mobs weren't. I raided as a fire mage and topped the damage charts most of the time, having hit enough hit chance and warlock curse.
---
I think I put Wrath&gt;MoP but otherwise that list is spot on. Wrath PvP was really fun and I loved raiding Naxx, Ulduar, and ICC. MoP PvP was really fun too but I personally didn’t raid much outside LFR.

I mean obviously none of us know for certain, but it seema pretty reasonable to assume we'd get a normal damage Lupos with all the "1.12 is the best/most complete patch of classic" talk
---
No he will sit at 41 yards in cheeta form. You don't run fast enough to close the gap and, you don't move fast enough to get away. If a good hunter gets the drop on a warrior. The only play a warrior has is to die.
---
That being said the skill cap on a hunter is really really high. If you stumble even for a second he's on you and your dead. Like I said though unless the hunter fucks up. You won't get on him and you will die.
---
41 yards is 37.49 meters

&lt;Deus Vult&gt; is NA horde pve, we are using loot ladder.
---
Raiding at 11pm to 3am EST (8pm to 12am PST) on Friday and Saturday.
---
We are recruiting prot warriors and dps, maybe a healer.  DM me if you’re interested and we’ll chat!
---
T3
---
No Deadmines in the beta
---
I remember confusing my guild leader in MC by topping the DPS charts as a Holy Paladin.
---
I was spamming Blessing of Sacrifice and causing damage to myself.
---
that actually sounds even better nice
---
Fine if you only want to do one of the BGs. If you want to queue for more than one at once you need to get running.
---
There was no blood elf in vanilla though?
---
Wait, where's pornhub in that browser history?
---
From what Ive gathered you want me to make a priest. /s
---
I appreciate your enthusiasm for sarcasm, but to become a master you mustn't use /s.
---
*I'm a human being, and this action was performed manually.*
---
I don’t remember MoP warlocks, what was unique about them? I played Lock in Wrath and Cata but switched to War for MoP.
---
New expansion is pretty good imo although new class is whatever but it feels great with Demo who never had clean class combination. Also they added infinite mode and mobility skill to buy for every class.
---
Yeah that's what I was thinking. Then on AQ and up I'd just eat the Respec cost.
---
Hi, /u/Chiefontheleaf
---
Theres an NPC that patrolls from Goldshire to Sentinial Hill, to Darkshire, to Lakeshire and back, he waits by the inns in the cities sometimes. His name is [Antonio Perelli](https://classicdb.ch/?npc=844) and he is [still in the game now](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=844/antonio-perelli). He sells some limited quantity weapons that are pretty good like the Executioner's Sword.
---
On most private servers he patrolls to the edge of elwynn by hogger then walks back to the other edge by redridge.  On TBC and Wrath servers sometimes he's programmed correctly but it's still pretty rare, the items he sells are actually useful for leveling but pretty high level for elwynn. 
---
I like to point to him as an example of good scripting. NPC behavior like him is almost totally forgotten about and buried and a ton of NPCs are supposed to do things that they don't on private servers and were removed from the game in Cata.
---
How is this different from dungeons you can only do one at a time or get running
---
Haha that is amazing! And that's the main take away. As long as no one is dying or wiping due to lack of heals, it should be fine.
---
I think "retailer" might be a new slur on Classic. Even though Classic is actually going to be a retail product now...
---
they are not fair.

---
Thats probably the reason we never got it
---
They have compromised on the soulbound item trading. It only being available in raids is a big plus to limiting it's impact on the game. Most gear will be master looted in these scenarios anyway so having trading to limit mistakes and gm tickets isn't a bad deal. I would have been game breaking to have in dungeon groups though.   
---
Battlenet integration isn't that big of a deal. If you don't want someone to have your battlenet ID... just have them friend the character. How would you decide that is game breaking?
---
I remember there being a small quest line in azshara that you just did a lot of running around turning in these quests but it gave you a ton of experience. Definitely worth to stop by there
---
Pretty sure hide helm/cloak was always there.
---
That really pissed me off when they took that option away and made it part of transmog....
---
This make me feel a little less at ease.
---
Gnomes... Won't be in, small things that no one really thinks about.
---
The problem that most people have with the new models is that many faces lost “character”. The new faces look mostly the same while the old ones had some stark differences between them.
---
Here are some examples:
---

I was terrified when I first played Diablo 1 and was chased by the Butcher. It was just a bunch of red and black pixels but it sure didn't change anything about how I felt back then. Imagination goes beyond graphics at least in my mind.
---
If the hunter gets the drop at max range it’s obviously an uphill battle. But you should be able to close the gap with some combination of trinket, rocket helm, rocket boots, stopwatch, speed-pot, skull, tidal charm, net, grenade, intercept, right? May have to speed-pot just to drop combat and switch to hunter-specific kit.
---
How many feet is it though? Since your so gosh darn smart?
---
Depends on itemization timelines but for the most part, no? By the time the pvp system is out and you'll be able to rank up to get these items most of them will be outdated. Theres probably a few exceptions but generally it will probably be useless.
---
Exactly.
---
sure, but even being on the low end you can make enough gold to cover consumes without "no-lifing" is i guess more what i'm getting at
---
I was there as a teenager, but I don't think it's as interesting as people think it was. Feel free to DM me and I'll answer whatever questions you have to the best of my ability.
---
Also, I recommend you look up Kevin Jordan (former WoW class designer) and John Staats (former WoW 3D level designer), as they're both pretty active in the Classic community and were around during the time of the Corrupted Blood event. You can also find one or two peer-reviewed papers that cover the Corrupted Blood from a scientific viewpoint.
---
If they level fast enough DM North won't even be out yet to give him time to get gear at least...
---
No. You have a skills tab, and a reputation tab, and gear slots for a reason.
---
1/29/21 is such a good pvp spec, and to be honest is very similar to 30/0/21 (or 31) where you have all the necessary baseline healing talents to heal well with a proper healing gear set.
---
Unless you're in a "hardcore" pve raiding guild, either is totally fine assuming you don't suck at healing.
---
Cast on the move incinerate, a lot of utility spells still, still have most of our CC, inferno and the like weren’t CDs the way they are now, Aff was still great on AOE, Demonology had Metamorphosis so you could sit back with demons shooting people then jump in as Meta smashing shit. Meta also had a glyph so you could tank. Our mount could have water walking, hellfire still existed and Rain of Fire was still good. The class was pretty much better in every way.
---
Also we one shot people at SoO gear level with chaos bolt.
---
Wow that was very well written thanks!

Chen wasn't an easter egg. He was a full blown character same as Cairne or Rexxar. They developed lore and a backstory for him as well. He was an integral part of an entire campaign.
---
Assume things will be in their 1.12 version unless stated otherwise.
---
&gt;I love classic but if the only option was to play with new models I'd prolly give runescape a try.
---
Kind of hope it's like that then. So tired of the #nochanges shit. Going around like you're better than everyone else because you want lower texture resolutions or whatever. Sniffing your own farts. Smug fucks.
---
Oh hell yeah. Hunters are amazing solo. You're already fairly tough (leather then mail), and in addition you get a permanent group member in your pet. Leveling and questing is a blast.
---
The old model looks like Lenin so I love it &lt;3
---
&lt;Deus Vult&gt; is a horde pve guild.
---
We have an experienced core already who has cleared end game raids throughout multiple expansions including vanilla.
---
We raid Friday and Saturday night at 11pm to 3 am EST (8pm to 12am PST)
---
Currently in need of a couple prot warriors and some DPS.
---
DM me for more details!
---
the pvp gear for rogue isn't great. also are you talking about pve or pvp gear? you're either going dalrends and doing pre-raid bis or you're going full on raid logging. bis for pvp is full t2 with x2 misplaced servoarms with lifesteal enchant for hemo, or full t3 naxx for prep dagger
---
I wonder if there would be a way to do this properly? Admittedly no idea how you could prevent scammers, but something like Blizz drastically lowers the sub for people in some countries/some circumstances, based on donations from better off people? But to ensure people getting the reduced subs actually were low income would probably be too complex and take a lot of manpower/investment from Blizz . . .
---
Happy to hear that. 
---
I like them for more than nostalgia I think they just look overall better. Like Male orcs in the correct game throw their hands over their head when they jump and it just looks so silly like a Disney character. I think they're objectively more cool with old models because the skeleton movements were more robust and strong. 
---
But with the movie you linked and a good amount of other stuff they mix the new models with the old animations and movements, which makes the new models look like just a huge improvement, but when you play with it in BFA you're flappying around like a pool noodle lol
---
Eventually, it'll be shortened to just "Tailer" and it'll be confusing to new players.
---
*YIKES*
---
You should start doing bird houses on fossil island if you havent already. 3 days and ive gone from 9-47 hunter and made about 350k gp passively from selling the nests and seeds.
---
not sure if your playing the same game I am, been playing wsg all weekend and I can count on one hand how many LAPs have been used against me
---
Get a full tier/pvp set to display in the middle of your city for others to see 
---
That’s pretty much it 
---
But it’s worth it
---
Every class was essentially a different class with their own unique mechanics. Tons and new spells and interesting play styles.
---
God damn i love that movie.

Haha that's ingenious!

Like anyone can even know that.

---
I thought realistically only warriors could tank?
---
Hi everyone,
---
I’ve decided to come back to WoW after 6 years, looking forward to Classic.  
---
I wouldn’t call myself a hardcore player, going to play with some RL buddies and end game Raid/PVP
---
Looking to play a Rogue or Warrior I believe but which one would you say it the easier of the two to master?
---
I'm happy to tank 5 mans if I choose Warrior but when it comes to raiding no, strictly DPS for raids.
---
Would love to hear all your suggestions on which one
---
Appreciate all the replies thanks!
---
The stones that bind us
---
It depends. Assuming comparable gear elemental typically has a faster single target time to kill. Enhancement killing is is slower but it requires less stopping to eat and drink. Either is viable so people either go with what is more fun for them or what their available gear supports better.
---
Yeah I was wondering that when Phase II hits, while focusing on raiding most of the time, if there are any PVP rewards that are working farming that may last up until AQ.  
---
It doesnt sound like this is the case and from what you're saying, PVE = loot, PVP = just for fun correct?
---
Forget it, you won't understand if I just keep repeating it. PVP is not PVE.
---
There's a reason it took Blizzard a few weeks to implement teleporting to battlegrounds and five years to implement teleporting to dungeons. Think for a minute.
---
I hear you, I'm ready to enjoy the scenery and just worry about my dps rotation. frostbolt...frostbolt...frostbolt...frostbolt...frostbolt
---
I still wake up in cold sweats after having a nightmare of dying in a single unbreakable death coil.
---
The worst thing about the new models are the new crap animations :/
---
I played on a PvE server most of early WoW (until Cata or MoP I think), and in hindsight I really loved to have that opt-in PvP. There were still huge fights that broke out, leading to Tarren Mill vs Southshore, or similar events which did happen on PvE realms. I'm going to begg my friends to play on a PvE realm.
---
ya itll be interesting to see how big of nazis many guilds are.
---
I 5 manned Ony in t2. and we'd 15 man mc in bwl gear. it isnt tough stuff it people know what they are doing. And people "who knew what they were doing" in retail vanilla are a lot worse directly compared to people who "know how to play" today.
---
Okay, I'm sure all of the dragons in BWL were fire immune. And I know at least Rag and Baron were immune in Molten Core. Which bosses could you actually hit?
---
Stop jumping backwards and melee fight me, damn it.
---
There is no source, there was one fucking panda in the entire universe! But we get an expac about that and not the numerous other races that were being asked for.
---
You definitely hit on a lot of good points.  I think i originally was going to mention the LFG community but forgot.  Oops.
---
In general the pugging scene has gone to shit, and honestly i think it was already bad before all the cross-realm, though a lot of that may be lower subscriber numbers.
---
I remember running with other guilds on weekends and stuff, or guilds that were known for running more 'open' groups with friends and stuff.  Maybe those still exist, i just dont really see them.
---
Maybe some of that is that i dont socialize as much anymore.  Maybe a lot of it is that most players dont have as much time as they used to.  I dunno.
---
How about "retail retard"?
---
I can already hear the murlocs in the background
---
I don't think literally anybody will care about "top guild" for vanilla content.
---
At that point it's literally about who shits in a bedpan more, than about who is more skilled.
---
No what's me mean longer then Arthas?  They're both in WC3
---
Desolace, 100%. I get really upset when I reach the level that I have to spend my time there...
---
Got to level 11 as a mage on a P Server.
---
Holy crap, is it boring. Kill. Drink. Kill. Drink.
---
Cannot speak for the other 49 levels but there's absolutely no shortage of mages everywhere I go so I'm guessing a lot of players love it.
---
It kinda started as rock paper scissors but by the time 1.12 rolled out and player skill improved it lost most of its meaning, then when you add in engineering and other random pvp items (skull, tidal) etc it becomes even more muddled.
---
If he's a warlock that means your group still needs a healer or tank. If you want groups fast be a healer or tank.
---
IMO you have two options. If you go Paladin then you can eventuall go prot and get huge groups of mobs and the warlock will DoT them all up and it would be a lot of fun leveling together. Killing like 10 things at a time and they all die at the same time. Then you could also use more damage based pets rather than sticking with a boring VW tank the whole time. And you'd be a tank in groups so that would be nice. 
---
Or you can go priest and if you're both shadow you can DPS things very fast and play off eachother nicely. You can heal most dungeons even as shadow specced until about level 40-50 then you might want to switch to heal if you're doing a lot of dungeons. 
---
If i'm a warlock I'd probably rather have a Prot pally friend. because if you're  both shadow cloth classes you'll also be competing for items.
---
Didn't play a hunter in classic but our hunters usually showed of their skills early in UBRS with competent kiting and later by simply having their quest bow.
---
New models are fucking garbage, having the real models is a huge deal and made together with everything else the game we all fell for.
---
2000% another game with the updated ones.
---
NO!
---
&gt; been playing wsg all weekend 
---
yeah me too and lap is used by almost everyone myself included. just cuz some level 58 shaman doesn't use lap on u doesn't mean it isn't true. i even see pre-raid geared players popping living action potions
---
I think you're looking at the wrong faces. They redid them recently. Here's around half of the new faces:
---
[New faces!](https://i.imgur.com/j49OUIb.png)
---
Thanks for the comparison! I never really realized how massively different the new style was. I think I just kind of got used to it. 
---
Please make it go away now.
---
Yeah that was ideal. Honestly, having a 10m easy 25m hard was perfect, too. It wasn't TOO convoluted, encouraged the more extreme raiders to group with a larger team, closer to how it was in Vanilla/BC. Yet 10m wasn't a pushover compared to 25m, like how Normal mode is now. 
---
Flex-mode was a godsend at the time, but looking back, it took NO time to find a replacement for Siege of Orgrimmar. The entrance was literally at the main city. Realms were cluster-fucked together so there was a "healthy population". I would gladly go back and undo flex if i could, not only does it make the raid feel way too fluid and non-consequential, but having that \*extra\* difficulty just made things feel awful.
---
*:shudders:*
---
I'm not sure about arthas and the details, as I never played old warcraft games, but they've been around since warcraft III
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/History_of_pandaren_in_Warcraft
---
Will the /sit macro shenanigans work in Classic?
---
It feels a bit weird when a BIG ORC WARRIOR sits down during combat to proc enrage.
---
I'm not saying the new models are perfect, or I like everything about them, but I'd take them over the old ones all day everyday. Just give us a toggle and let the topic rest in peace.
---
Yeap. Wasn't so bad when we still could enable old models, but the priest I played since Vanilla absolutely does not feel like that priest any more. Honest, that Human Female head makes a pretty decent head double for Chucky - including the receding hairline.
---
Nope, vanilla warriors are worse. They are pretty much hunters without a ranged attack in that bracket.
---
Yeah you can, but you won't have to worry about it until later. Unless you get the engi goggles, you won't have a helm for a while.
---
Yeah I've never been a fan of the new animations. Way too flashy for me too.
---
While I agree, I've been banned from places for less offensive words.
---
Summer.
---
All the tourists will call us "beaters" and rage at how quickly we breeze through the zones =3
---
You remember undead rogues dominating because people think undead look cooler than orcs. I mean dwarf rogues are the best rogue and I rarely saw them.
---
I fully support Napoleon Dynamite memes
---
The weird thing is when you DO find a bloodelf and realize it's just a pale-skinned version of the night elf model.
---
Can we have checkboxes instead of having to write everything?
---
So....if we should not report it to Blizzard as griefing (which it is and clearly a reportable offense), what should we do?
---
Report it in General and get trolled even more?  
---
I’m far from a Snowflake there sweetie.
---
Its kind of sad that the Horde equivalent of Red ridge, Stonetalon Mountains, is such an empty zone.  I actually quite like it there, but I guess its out of the way and not as pretty as Red Ridge.
---
No, druid can tank very well in all 5man, all of MC and most of bwl. Then they need aq40 gear to tank aq40 and some naxx bosses.
---
Blood Fury gets a nice buff to it's base power (I think it may scale up with you're attack spell power, not sure) and includes spell power in TBC and makes it a considerable buff to have. In Vanilla and TBC orc rogues are BiS in PvE on a pure patchwork besides the very last patches of sunwell and naxx, at that point Trolls overpower you due to Berserking Scaling with gear.
---
Hardiness unfortunately gets nerfed to 15% and stays this way until cata were it decreases the duration of stuns and becomes godlike again. It's still very good but 15% is just kinda meh, but resisting a 5sec kidney or HoJ is still insane.
---
Undead takes over as dominate pvp race just for TBC and Wrath horde side, somewhat due to the overwhelming prevalence of warlocks in TBC but also the reliability of the racial, you can WotF every arena, but you might resist any stuns in a given game.
---
Orc is always a great choice for a rogue race, you will always be #1 or #2 at something, through the 14 years of WoW, you are never useless if you PvP and PvE, even if sometimes you #2 at both. I'll be going Orc rogue in classic.
---
Very few wil be prepared for a fall which is why so many people die, and yes people do actually scream in these types of situations even if it’s not about falling
---
true. fjord was amazing. pretty much everything was great. tundra was not mine though
---
You can't close threads in Reddit 
---
LMAO at all of these people crying and downvoting because you said you like pvp
---
Well if he can afford 200 of them more power to him, if your using full consumes in pug bgs you gotta be loaded, prices add up quick considering bgs don't give shit for gold
---
Yeah, it's no issue to get in melee range against bad (or just not so tryhard) hunters, but against good players who would match my rocket boots with their own, etc, I just have no idea what to do. Do any items outrange 41 yards?
---
 [http://www.nooooooooooooooo.com/](http://www.nooooooooooooooo.com/)
---
It doesn’t matter, it was one panda there was no deep lore! There are literally 5 other races who had deeper more interesting lore at the time mop was created.
---
Ally get salv (and wisdom and kings) on the whole raid with just 3 or 4 pallies whereas horde need 8 shaman to come close and would still be missing buffs. For example melee classes need windfury and it's the same totem as salv so they can't have both. Or they can but then the shaman can barely heal (or dps) because half their gcds and mana are going to totems. Salv alone is a massive buff, it lets your dps go much harder and covers for your tank not getting lucky with threat gear and weapons while gearing in new content.
---
Fear ward also turns some 2 tank fights into 1 tank fights which can be easier to manage.
---
Pallies can also do some fun tricks with bop and aoe tanking that horde just can't really replicate easily. These are mostly used in speed runs, but still that's something that draws in the more hardcore raiders.
---
And lastly real late game when everyone is full T3 kings becomes a ridiculously op buff. To the point where if you look at private server records for any server that has made it that far, ally will hold 9/10 spots for the top dps or hps in any class.
---
Nah, Arthas was in the lore before Pandaren were. Pandas were announced as an April Fool's Day joke during the development of WC3. Pandaren ended up in WC3 as a neutral creep and sort of an easter egg/joke, and then Blizz added the Pandaren Brewmaster for the expansion.
---
Refresh this feed every 5 minutes, that helps tremendously.
---
That's with trinkets and dr, you poor sap
---
Go play the founding of Orgrimar in WC III. The foundation of vanilla.
---
Lol still heard the na na na song in my head
---
Then you just have multiple people use a campfire. I've seen 4 at the IF flight master murder 60s
---
For all the flack it got about way too many dailies for rep grinding, that was part of the reason I liked it so much. It reminded me of BC in that regard, and it always gave me something to do and build towards.
---
What was in WoD was pretty good by modern WoW standards. Main problem was that there was basically no end game content, you ended up raidlogging, and even that was pointless after a while as they didn't release the new raid for ages. It was a really cool expansion to play for a month or two though.
---
The little orc "Yo" they throw in there fucking gets me every time.
---
Awesome to see Hybrid specs becoming more accepted! Maybe druids can finally fulfill their dream of proper multi-roling.
---
Maybe it can be auto disabled in large cities or when there are a crap load of people in one spot
---
Old PVP videos are the best for this.
---
I very clearly remember dueling people on the campfire next to scholomance to die and run through the door, maybe the fire was just always there and wasnt player made, that i cant remember
---
The way I'm approaching Vanilla is: one glorious run through my favourite ever game. If some dude wants to roll a non-ideal spec, no biggy. We're gonna laugh all the way through a 3 hour Maraudon wipe fest, right?
---
RIGHT?
---
In all seriousness, I look forward to people playing their hearts out to make non-ideal specs shine. It's all part of the fun.
---
Yeah got to love how badass Undead Rogues look.  
---
Another plus for Orc is their racial mount.
---
Hi, /u/ithilras
---
I mean, WotF is definitely a big factor in making UD more attractive for pvp.
---
- killing a lowbie once is ok
---
- hanging out and killing them over and over makes you a loser
---
- dont be a loser
---
On launch? No it's not. It is quite some phases away..
---
Play the World of Warcraft board game. It feels far more like WoW than WoW has for years.
---
Whoa, I never knew this! Seems much less useful without being raid-wide and a smart heal... I only played my priest in Vanilla in WotLK where I loved CoH.
---
I played Horde back in the day. So I am going with Alliance this time. I keep reading that when you are done leveling an Alliance in classic, you will have more people in your friend list. So that was the factor that made me decide.
---
Hell, just play WC3 + TFT in its entirety. That's about 40+ hours of Warcraft goodness.
---
I thought spell batching was a fairly small detail that Blizzard wouldn't bother with but I was proven wrong.
---
paladins are pretty unkillable with full t3 with naxx shield, they also have ranged 6s stun. eye for an eye also reflects 2k damage to casters so they're a lot more offensive than priests. shadow is still lots of fun tho
---
Yeah I really really should do this. I was hoping that new remaster would come out before vanilla but it doesn't seem like it.
---
I have never played the original warcrafts. Maybe I should play diablo II as well
---
[FTFY, STV theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqGVh7ODu7I)
---
this is a thing?
---
Also if you get the Baron Rivendare mount as an Undead, no one cares, it looks just like your normal mount. But an orc on an Undead Mount draws enough attention for people to look and see you got a crazy rare cool mount.
---
I'd be so pissed if I was undead and I saw it drop.
---
gimme your faves bro
---
You do not stack reckoning while aoe farming as a paladin.
---
But sitting for stacks ***is*** blizzlike.
---
Top guilds will require pre-bis for new recruits looking to join up later (and they would be much happier to see you in pug'd mc loot than just pre-bis) but you can bet your ass they'll be doing mc in greens the first week
---
IIRC it was initially nerfed to 15% chance to resist instead of 25% and then eventually nerfed to 15% stun duration rather than chance to resist. I could be wrong on that, but that's how I remember it. 
---
UD rogues were really strong because WoTF was just crazy and never got touched while orc racial got nerfed to the ground.
---
I thought so too but apparently its up for debait? Idk, not counting on it.
---
Here are my problems with the new models:
---
1. Tauren are completely ruined. They were so badass before. Run animation legit looks like it came out of a backyardigans genre cartoon or something
---
2. Gnomes were cute, now they’re just disgusting. 
---
3. Orc run animation is dumb as hell
---
4. Male troll run animation is dumb as hell
---
5. Male dwarf run animation is actually the worst. The models definitely look better, but the running is so ugh. Like they’re taking quick little hops
---
It really doesn't change. Unless you are going to be aoe grinding, Frostbolt will be your friend until 60.
---
as Teradar said, Mages are pretty much Gods that can do almost anything they want... the trade off is not bein very fun to play in dungeon/raid content.

Not my cup of tea anymore but it does feel like I’m 14 again thinking of those songs.
---
the amount of armor you have only matters if you get whacked without anything between you and what whacked you
---
Eastern plaguelands was great, I loved the battle of darrowshire quest line.
---
I've lost track of the times I've played through Dun Morogh and Elwynn Forest, and I could still do them again happily.
---
But still not a dispel. That's why priests are used more offensively in the higher end premades
---
Yeah if you can pick up BRE from Raggy you will hit pretty hard. Warriors will always fair infinitely better with heals, even in bad gear

The WoW boardgame is fucking massive. There are two expansions (shadows of Amn and the burning crusade) and a blizzcon exclusive card back. I paid $500 for all four pieces and consider it one of my most prized possessions. Games take 4 to 6 hours, and are really fun. Quests and items are randomly generated, so no two games are the same. The game is faction vs faction, horde vs alliance, with each faction working as a team with 2 to 3 people. The objective is to down the boss first, but they're HARD.
---
Doesnt WoTF also get nerfed at some point and become dispellable?
---
Right?! Those damn runes. If only there was a way to get from Orgrimmar to Undercity without paying a copper...
---
I do not see how there is a debate about that, a /sit macro was a known thing for pvp reckoning in vanilla.
---
HotW is alot better then this
---
You can basically level a hunter like a complete retard and you will still reach lvl 60 easy. Back in the day, a lot of hunters just kept being retards at lvl 60, and that's where the "huntard" name comes from.
---
Like u/Money_Manager mentioned, the difference between a good and a bad end-game hunter is massive. Nowadays there are video guides on how to play a hunter, so there really isn't an excuse for being a "huntard" ;)
---
Classic will use 1.12 data (including NPC placement and scripting). Nothing of this nature will be missing. :)
---
That's because you have no brain and you don't think. You think you do, but you don't.
---
Yeah tweaking specs changes the entire game dynamic. Aka not Classic anymore. Might sound extreme but it’s accurate.
---
Agreed but i expect alot of new and not so experienced vanilla healers will turn up in Classic, Mana Tide can help them :D
---
If a game has voice chat, I turn it off.
---
I feel you, the only humans that don't turn me off in fantasy games are, well... more exaggerated variants like giant bearded dudes. 
---
It's a common choice across games, most popular races are almost always fair skinned and attractive humans or elves. 
---
Even in games where racials don't exist or matter less, or non-mmo's like persistent roleplaying nwn servers, humans tend to be the most common choice, unless aforementioned fair skinned elves are also an option.
---
Absolute shit taste. Feralas, 1k needles, and desolace are all awesome zones (although desolace does kinda suck because you don't have a mount at that point).
---
Personally, I hate ashenvale and STV
---
Being MT healer on Nef was fun. 
---
But seriously, you get Benediction/Anathema, the hands down COOLEST ITEM in ANY game EVER.
---
Scarab Lord obviously if we are talking bragging rights.
---
Is there a pre-bis raid document, What to do and where to do it to unlock the raids and all that stuff, for Horde.
---
&gt;this is actually a pretty funny idea. nice
---
I feel you man!! I like Destiny 2 but was sort of over it so took a break and playing it is pretty fun again. Diablo 3 has a new season I’ll rock coming up. RDR2 is good, GTA V is SO good, monster hunter world is dope. Lots of good games out there. Another approach I have been taking is just not playing video games as much so when classic hits my wife doesn’t kill me.
---
It depends. A lot of marines suffering from PTSD actually feel more relieved when they go back into combat.
---
You know how "The real &lt;x&gt; was the friends we made along the way" became a huge meme because of Destiny?
---
It's actually true for Classic.
---
Gotta give a shoutout to hillsbrad foothills, alterac mountains, hinterlands, winterspring, and tirisfal glades
---
Blood fury also affected spell power in TBC.
---
and this is correct, but you shouldn't pass on an ashkandi simply because you want an axe.
---
ahah, i just fell and lost 20min to find my way back
---
Also, Ice, undead, lich King and nordic themes&gt;&gt;&gt;panda themes.
---
You can pretty much avoid that by advertising your portals in the chat (Just make sure that you have all of them) and then you usually get tipped 4-5x the Value of a Portal Rune.
---
At worst you'll get the Rune paid.
---
Only 2 zones out of Wrath expansion are based on Vikings and their mythology - Howling Fjord and Strom Peaks.
---
I only really have myself and 3 good friends who'd be down to play. Is this enough people to play?
---
Only people I have seen hate on MoP were people who didn't play it at all or only very little, and couldn't stand the panda/chinese theme. Everyone I know who played the expansion says it's one of their favourites. But there was a huge outcry about MoP before it was launched, but again, that's from people who didn't play it and simply couldn't stand the theme. 
---
Literally everyone dislikes WoD in some capacity. Some people (like me) liked what was in the expansion, but we still felt like there was way too little end game content to be playable. So despite liking most things about it I still quit a few months in due to boredom. WoD also brought probably the biggest sub spike at the launch of a WoW expansion ever, there were a ton of players coming back to the game for that, not many "I think I'll pass". Problem was people then left again not long after coming back.

wow soundtrack.  hits you right in the feels.
---
although grim is one of most known rogues, he wasnt that good and would never fight with disadvantage (aka out of stealth or no cd)
---
And you wouldn't be terrified again if you played Diablo 1 now.
---
What is a Lore PvPer?
---
You should be fine, I was in a casual raiding guild in vanilla that allowed hybrid specs and we didn't really use consumables or optimize at all. Without really trying too hard we made it all the way up to Twin Emps in AC40 before BC release (everything else was on farm). 
---
I'm confident we could have kept going if we had more time. While we weren't the best guild on the server we had fun and did well, we actually outlasted a lot of the hardcore guilds because of our mentality.
---
Honestly I think this will be the norm in Classic (at least moreso than the hardcore/private server crowd makes things out to be). In my experience, just filling 40 raid spots can be a challenge so at a certain point we would take whoever was online - more people is better than less regardless of spec. Plus, you start being able to clear farm content with less than 40 people pretty quickly.
---
Really, pure specs, optimal compositions, and consumables are only required for progression guilds. Personally I wouldn't even want to do things that way as the content becomes too easy and you run out of it more quickly, but it's vanilla so I think we'll see a lot of people playing differently/how they like and that is a good thing.

---
0/22/29 is the real deal
---
[https://imgflip.com/i/2z9lyt](https://imgflip.com/i/2z9lyt)
---
Great against shamans? As in alliance warriors would have an extra class to beat up on compared to horde warriors?
---
It me.
---
didnt hear about the phases, nice this is great news
---
&gt;Hunters have one of the best, if not, the best gold farming tactics in the game. You'll be spending a lot of time farming gold for epic mount, enchant, consumables, and respecs at minimum.
---
Solo tribute runs won't work in classic if the demo client is an indicator.. they updated the mob pathing
---
I actually don't know, but even if it does you can always use it to freak the fear right as it happens. As long as fears exist it has some value.
---
On my rogue I leveled 57-60 going in the same circles of orcs over and over again.
---
Wrath had some serious flaws that get lost.   
---
What the fuck was that first tier? Every boss was a joke, only Sarth 10m 3d had any challenge. 
---
Then Ulduar--great. 
---
Then TOGC? Okay raid, but what is that pacing? 
---
ICC was good
---
All raids in mop were good until the first...7 of SoO? (only heroic is considered) 
---
wrath introduces LFD. I always see Wrath as the point where Blizzard looked at the data and said "Aha! making it easier is the answer!" then by the end of mop blizzard is beginning to realize theyve gone too far.
---
We do it because it makes us laugh.
---
They are great next to shamans
---
The game is balanced around either 4 players (2v2) or 6 (3v3), so you can absolutely play with you and three friends.
---
You can also play a 3v3 game where your 2 man groups control three characters. Because it's faction vs. faction, the two players on the horde (for example) are going to be working as a team anyway; you don't just control your character and ignore your partner. That's a good way to die fast. If you walk into a green quest by yourself at level 1, you're headed to the spirit rezzer fast.
---
With three toons for two players, you'd just work together like, "Okay the Hunter can solo this quest because he's BM, but the Paladin and the Priest will two man these quests over here, and then they'll all loop around and 3 man this quest for the big reward."
---
I see your combo and raise you: fire nova , war stomp, ele mastery chain lighting, shock, goblin sapper
---
&gt; I see your combo and raise you
---
**no string bets, please!**
---
_^(I'm a pointless bot. "I see your X and raise you Y" is a) ^[string](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/string_bet) ^[bet,](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/string_bet) ^(and is not allowed at most serious poker games.)_
---
Yeah I agree, but theres a massive amount of people saying its "a private server bug" and blizzard might listen to them. Idk, You're the only one I've seen agree it's blizzlike.
---
Poggers
---
I laughed pretty hard at this
---
Exactly
---
as you say, in pvp. It doesnt proc on white hit from mobs nor player. Only yellow hit from both players and npc.
---
Tourists wave will also contain a significant amount of players that will discover their love for less streamlined gaming experience for the first time in their lives.
---
Please be kind to them, if only because the future of gaming is dependent upon these players.
---
Good one. I’m going to use this one a lot if some of my fellow hordies piss me off.
---
One thing to consider too, is take a look at the content phase releases. AQ40 is phase 5 and Naxx is phase 6. We have no idea how long the phases are but if we assume ~3 months average, then AQ war effort won't release for a year+, the point where most people say hunter damage falls off. So that's a good year of being very viable, all else equals.
---
I think what's the most important is to determine if you like the class play style. Make sure you like having a pet and all the quirks that come with hunter pets. Make sure you like shooting your bow from afar. If this combat and system feels good to you and is fun, you'll enjoy playing a hunter.
---
Two orange enemies is easy for a mage. Sheep one, nuke the other.
---
Three green or orange starts to get challenging. For a frost mage, sheep one and kite the other two.
---
Usually if I died while soloing, it was because I ran into other mobs while kiting or screwed up my blink. Positioning is important.

wod was terrible. yeah i totally forgot it. Only expansion i skipped. Got to max, got my pre raid, cleared normal, and quit the week heroics or mythics or whatever they were then--didnt log back in till antorus of legion. Was disgusted with bfa within 2 months. 
---
Back to playing d2lod while I wait for classic :(
---
Of course not every single program they launched was a success. That does not mean they were not more "down to Earth"/openly community oriented back then than they are now.
---
Just look at [this snapshot from Mar 15, 06](https://web.archive.org/web/20060315195732/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/) and you'll see what I mean.
---
On one page, you can see movie contest winners, the screenshot of the day, a community spotlight, a comic strip, a weekly roundup of blue posts on the forums, multiple different contests to win a TBC beta invite, fan art submissions, and the initial post about the guild relations program.
---
And ALL of those community oriented posts are coming from a 12 day timeframe. Are they doing all of this as simple PR stunts? Or to show their level of investment within their community? You tell me.
---
Compare this to the current [worldofwarcraft.com](https://worldofwarcraft.com/) homepage and it's night and day. No sense of community engagement.
---
You cannot view this comparison and deny the level of community engagement old "down to Earth" Blizzard had compared to now.
---
if that was true, it would be pretty much everyone. Vanilla ended 11 years ago.
---
Always played a warrior in every game. Probably going to do that again. Currently trying out different classes on private servers to see if anything else clicks so I don't waste my time leveling something I don't enjoy.
---
actually the double hit proc from sword spec is way better
---
The only thing ive settled on is a rogue lol, still debating race, spec and professions :(
---
This is one of those 'wait and see' things as we don't know what will be patched and fixed. Solo mara and generally hunter farming is still very good though.
---
There’s quite a lot of people who played vanilla,
---
Yes I remember it doing damage then not later on, but I am not sure if it ever put you in combat. So it could kill very low level players doing about 4 dps to overcome OOC regen.
---
Will sell Firestones for food.
---
But that's a private server, that's what I'm saying. It didn't work on the Classic demo client, mobs ran faster and would never stop hitting.
---
Maybe not completely must do, but I'd recommend everyone to complete the Scepter of the Shifting Sands questline. You are mad if you do it before the war effort is done, but once you are starting to raid AQ40 the rep grind goes really fast even if you don't clear the raid. 
---
The questline is long and epic while also giving some pretty damn good rewards. It's also doable for just about everyone, it'll just take a bit longer.
---
Green lens for them twinks! Man 39 Twinking was awesome! I still have my 39 hunter with two 1h swords and a green lens of the eagle
---
Give me the line that ‘clearly’ states this is an reportable offense. Come with an official blizzard line and not some psvr one.
---
Corpsecamping is also grieving but that also should be allowed. Then you’ll have to log off and wait.
---
It is the way it went in 2005~ and it is how it should go with classic.
---
I’m not the person that would do this but I would accept this behavior. Is it annoying? Yes. Do I need to complain to mr daddy? No.
---
How much is the real world blood fury DPS buff say in AQ?  Because as far as I know, it affects BASE attack power, not overall AP.  I assume at some point your base AP becomes less significant as your gear improves.  Anyone know?
---
I'll give it a shot. You can't say any class always beats another, skill, gear, CDs, RNG etc. all come into play. Some matchups are neutral, so I'll just list actual signficant disadvantages that will always be difficult. Maybe someone can expand or argue some points, I didn't play all classes at 60 after all. 
---
Warlock - disadvantage Rogue
---
Mage - disadvantage Warlock, Priest, Druid
---
Warrior - disadvantage everything except Rogue
---
Rogue - disadvantage Warrior, Paladin, Hunter
---
Priest - disadvantage Warlock
---
Hunter - disadvantage Warlock, Priest
---
Shaman - disadvantage Rogue, Warlock, Hunter
---
Druid - disadvantage Warlock, Shaman, Hunter
---
Paladin - disadvantage Shaman, Warlock, Priest
---
TL;DR - Spriest and warlocks are 1v1 gods, warriors are shit at 1v1, everything else is debatable.
---
you are right but there are people that simply don't do a lot of math daily and might not see this immediately, chill out
---
There are 6 phases to be released over what i assume will be atleast 1.5 years. And aq and naxx is phases 5 and 6 so quite some time away.
---
you mean this as [STVnam!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec0XKhAHR5I) theme
---
Legit greatest zone in any MMO ever, imo.
---
Atmospheric, brutal, varied, riven with game lore AND player lore. So damn good. I cannot fucking WAIT.
---
It's not even hard to be good, it's just people are so insanely bad.
---
Realizing your abilities clip auto-shots, and you can run sideways to run away at full speed and still use abilities, is half the battle.
---
probably my favourite starting zone in all honesty
---
Which means they, unlike the undead, did their job properly.
---
i wouldn't say mages struggle against shamans, but the ranged instant cast kick is brutal especially in BGs and even if the shaman has blue gear they can just spam purge on you and destroy your buffs. but in 1v1 a skilled mage with engineering isn't going to lose vs shaman. horde rogue is a bit harder than alliance rogue because stoneform removing blind and perception, but the skillcap is generally pretty low all across the board so it doesn't matter too much, most dwarves don't even seem to have stoneform hotkeyed. horde warriors can also be pretty tough too because of paladins.
---
But Deso/Badlands are pauper zones compared to STV. Empty in all senses.
---
EMBRACE THE LAW OF THE JUNGLE
---
warriors blow to level solo. That weeds out a lot of people.
---
Warriors are by far the worst class if you dont get "the gear". Your non raiding warrior caps out at Unstoppable Force unless he wants to go for R14--but if unwilling to put in the time to raid, whatre the odds they will make the R14 grind?
---
Everyone wants prot warriors for 5 mans. Every raid guild needs prot warriors--you may have trouble getting into an established one, but if you want to tank--find a fresh guild and be one of their tanks. 
---
Most warriors are afraid to tank, if youre not youll get invites to groups, and often have the power to exclude dps warriors or paladins allowing you to get the prot and dps warrior loot. (any warrior who doesnt tank everything pre UBRS/DM is a moron and deserves to be gearless)
---
None of my gamer buddies seem like they want to play, so I wont be playing a warrior--otherwise I would. But ya, im with you, im not slumming it with the masses as a warrior with no support system to help get me the gear to elevate me above the chaff.
---
Watch gameplay videos that involve leveling, raiding and pvp to decide what you want to play. It takes a fair bit of time to get to max level, don't do what I did and level a priest to 60 only to find out that I despise healing.
---
You don't want to read a short paragraph about enhance shamans, roll one and realize at level 57 that all you do is shock and bonk and pray to windfury jesus for a proc.
---
oh gosh i would give anything for new episodes of blue plz
---
Sounds awesome! Best of luck on your documentary. 
---
I was there during the incident. One of the things I remember was that right when I logged in my guildmates, and some chats were warning ppl to stay out of IF and SW. I was in a top raiding guild so I knew what corrupted blood was so I ported myself to Moonglade (druids ftw) and flew to Darnassus to check mail, bank, AH what not. I think after that I left to collect herbs in a remote place. Not sure if this was the case for all server but least on Aggramar-US i think Darnassus was blood corrupt free early on.
---
My favourite music in wrath is the one from Scholazar Basin. It gives me some sort of feeling inside and I don’t know how to explain it.
---
Yes, that is correct and thats why the Troll racial eventually becomes better in PvE. But the attack power is always a factor and always an increase in DPS, theres never a point were it becomes insignificant or not worth using. 
---
In actual vanilla the Troll racial berserking required you to be crit to use and Blood Fury [reduced your attack power when it faded](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Blood_Fury). But in the 1.12 versions the only downside is the healing debuff, which doesn't matter at the start a fight and the GCD, which you can also use before the fight starts, so theres effectively no downside and just a free extra 50+ attack power, I don't remember the exact values but you I know its 25% of base and your base AP at 60 is around 200. +50 attack power is like wearing an extra item.
---
Pre-Raid / Early into MC with a big 2H (Arcanite Reaper, BRE, HoR) is apparently when you are the strongest in the game (relative to everyone else), according to Monkeynews.

Feral tanks -&gt; Mark of the Chosen from Desolace and Mara questline
---
If you roll horde as a Warlock you never have to deal with Will of the Forsaken. Warlocks are more popular horde side, either because of that or orc and undead are badass as fuck.
---
Alot of people hate attacking into a paladin just to have him bubble so they role alliance. 
---
As a rogue it's nice to roll horde so you don't have to deal with Orc Stun resist. 
---
A druid's weakness is fear so going horde would mean fighting less warlocks. But gnomes can break your roots. 
---
As a horde hunter a dwarf rogue can remove serpent sting and vanish off hunters mark right next to you. But 
---
Theres tradeoffs to everything but you definitely want to be aware of how common racials interact with your class.
---
horde warlocks have the benefit of not having to play against will of the forsaken
---
It's not Deep State, it's Deep Rock. The secrets go beyond Old Ironforge and deeper than Blackrock Depths.
---
MoP classes were absolutely not dull, the real bones and mechanics of the game were very solid in MoP. Classes were well balanced and felt great to play for the most part, and PvP was balanced too. Most peoples issues with the expansion were about the theme, the stretch of the lore for the expansion idea, and the story line. Those are all fair complaints but I do not think a fair complaint is "the class mechanics felt dull".
---

---
The Arcane tree really has no talents that increase arcane missiles damage / crit.  On top of that, channeled skills get very poor contribution from spell power, so they never scale well with gear.
---
The normal raiding spec for MC on private servers is a 31/0/20 arcane power build, but you still use frostbolt because it just does better damage.
---
Me upvoting your comment: https://i.imgur.com/KRN8tSr.png
---
They were hardly in the lore... certainly not enough that it was "a matter of time" until it was apart of an expansion
---
Was an NE hunter from tail end of Vanilla into WotLK. 
---
Rerolled on OG PrimalWoW as an Orc Hunter and had great times there for a long while -&gt; fueled me to continue playing with my community and dive deeper into Vanilla. 
---
Have played other classes on different servers to expand my knowledge of the game but I still feel at home as a hunter and will be rolling troll hunter upon release.
---
It really will be interesting. Will just have to find a guild of people who support it. And that's also very true.
---
Good point for sure. But with time they will figure it out lol
---
Could I get a link to that wowhead rogue compendium? Tried searching the forums but i couldnt pull anything up
---
Dungeon finder is the exact reason i have disliked modern wow. Only reason i ever stayed subbed was to raid. Get max lvl, get raid ready, log out til next raid. LFD prettymuch killed wow for me.
---
&gt; If you roll horde as a Warlock you never have to deal with Will of the  Forsaken. Warlocks are more popular horde side, either because of that  or orc and undead are badass as fuck. 
---
alliance warlocks are usually sm/ruin so wotf doesn't matter

---
????
---
&gt; As a rogue it's nice to roll horde so you don't have to deal with Orc Stun resist. 
---
every race is immune to stuns at t2+ because of living action potions, and even then 25% doesn't really mean matter i have both alliance and horde rogues, and living action potions are the main concern for rogues
---
&gt; As a horde hunter a dwarf rogue can remove serpent sting and vanish off hunters mark right next to you. But 
---
any rogue can use anti-venom and vanish?
---
dwarf can remove blind
---
&gt; A druid's weakness is fear so going horde would mean fighting less warlocks. But gnomes can break your roots. 
---
what?
---
*slurping*
---
Well multi-roles in a raid where there is 40 people is totally useless just by the nature of the enviorment.  You're better off having two people be specialized to do a single task than a single person who can do a little of both.
---
However, for 5 mans, small scale pvp and that type of enviorment, hybrids CAN fufill their multi purpose role. DPS warriors can offtank the first target kill in a pull, shamans can tank spell caster mobs while still healing, druids have the option depending on situations to be in a feral form and also spot heal, etc.
---
But in a raid, its just better to do one thing really well rather than 2 things average.
---
I bet. They all have there benefits. Especially the flexibility aspect of the feral one being able to OT or pick up a mob.
---
That'd be pretty sweet to see!
---
Spelled "Alliance" wrong.
---
I view the rock, paper, scissor as valid until you throw in Engineering, certain items, and consumables. Then it's actually very balanced and higher skill will usually win. 
---
For example, a warrior will lose to frost mage every day of the week unless he gets frost reflector, imp intercept, and/or Live Giving Gem, Last Stand. 
---
Rogue can actually beat warriors until they get Life Giving Gem as well. Locks can beat rogues, but rogue with Tidal Charm can win. Etc, etc.
---
I love Ironforge but the music makes me angry, it's so loud and aggressive I'm trying to sort through my bank I'm not going into battle
---
Northrend overall resembles a Northern/Eastern European region of several countries, just like Pandaria resembles several different climes/countries within the continent of Asia. That seems acceptable to me for an expansion theme. We're pretty much just trading out one geographic region for another in that example. 
---
I also enjoy the diversity of WoW overall, but having one expansion focused on Asian visuals only adds to that diversity if you look at it from a big picture.
---
100% what I plan on doing. blowing people up in PvP while healing the raids Wooooo!!!!! try and sotp me!
---
If gnome racials were swapped with humans, I wonder how many people would play gnome. I know I am, mostly because I like the idea of being a tiny gnome mage, but the racials are nice too.
---
Suppose I'd be pretty pissed off if someone called me Alliance scum. Especially as a Troll.
---
That is literaly me right now..and tomorrow. And the day after...
---
They're pretty similar looking to me.
---
Honestly they didn't care because one person playing a bad class well is better than a person playing a good class terribly.
---
Mages counter shamans

Switch legion around for MOP and you're close
---
at one point I realized that I was looking up what school spells were in in vanilla so I had a better idea of how good certain talents will be
---
I mean I'm talking about the game in general, being like level 37 in STV, not high tier 1v1s dude. Obviously you can use consumables but getting entangling rooted when your level 30 means you're dead if anyones around and literally no one will carry anti-venom while leveling the entire time lol.
---
sure man: https://www.wowhead.com/forums&amp;topic=5962#p56045
---
Just a heads up though the author mixed this guide with his TBC experience aswell so might be some stuff thats not valid for classic.
---
Its great for explaining the core role and stats of being Rogue though.

I think the kind of things that might go under the radar that nobody thinks about are the kind of things that go under the radar that nobody thinks about on pservers, like some bugged NPC patrols and such. Blizz does have the 1.12 server-side data to correct a looot of this whereas previously people could really only guess, but I'd expect to see "wrong" in the same areas we see "wrong" on pservers.
---
I also expect error reports because of our own old/faulty memories of vanilla. The demo saw reports of warlocks, certain rare mobs, and Jangolode kobolds working incorrectly but Blizz was able to verify that on 1.12, those things were all supposed to work that way. But a lot of people were under the impression they were wrong for a variety of reasons, especially the warlock pet dismissing when you start summoning a new one. Blizz was able to confirm "summoning disorientation" was a TBC addition for 2.0.1, not 1.12.
---
At least better than "Kid"
---
He's a beast. But also geared, which I guess goes without saying for any warrior looking to win 1v1s. Even his pre-rank pre-bis video has got lionheart, TuF, stronghold gauntlets.
---
Agreed. I was one of the few people that actually really enjoyed 40 mans. 25 was cool and I did my highest level raid progression in 25 mans in BC, but I quite enjoyed the aspect of so many people in a raid. I also miss the class requirements from Vanilla, like Mind Control in Naxx or Tranquil Shot in MC, I believe. It allowed classes to feel unique and important. “Bring the player, not the class” is a noble idea, but it makes raid design stale, imo.

---
Pretty much.
---
A prebis for an ele shaman in pve is 99% cloth and doesn't use a shield.
---
Try to pull that garbage in pvp and you're a free kill.  
---
prebis is a pve damage/performance min-max list.  Those lists are almost totally irrelevant to pvp performance.
---
&gt;when you DO find a bloodelf and realize it's just a pale-skinned version of the night elf model
---
wait, the guy in Molten Core attunement quest?
---
I remember it as a typical blood elf from Outland.
---
You realize there were multiple versions of MC during vanilla. Just because the knockback wasn't 360 at launch doesn't mean it wasn't added as a mechanic later
---
wait, did they make a stick for this?
---
If all you care about is speed, you run solo.
---
Groups are slower. Always.You do not make up time, you lose even more time.
---
A two man "group" running solo except for group/Target kill quests will hit 60 roughly a ~day sooner than a duo who grouped the whole time.
---
it's about the same speed difference as pure quests vs Quest/Grind in terms of leveling speed.
---
You can use the charts on my site to help you make those kinds of general PVE/PVP gear comparisons. For instance, the Rank 7/8 gloves/pants with the 40 AP 2-piece set bonus is roughly comparable to the Devilsaur set.

---
I'd agree overall you're right, I just think this program specifically is a poor example. 
---
I think most game companies gave up on that type of community engagement with the advent of social medial. However, I think Bungie still does awesome shit like that:  https://www.bungie.net/
---
Quick search says the player damage wasn't removed until Wrath, so...yeah you should absolutely be able to do it in Classic.
---
:(
---
Hello, Smibbs! Don't be sad! Turn that frown upside down!

^Hello! ^I ^am ^currently ^in ^Beta. ^Please ^visit ^/r/INFIN1TYBots ^our ^subreddit ^to ^send ^feedback! ^Thanks!
---
&gt; and literally no one will carry anti-venom 
---
i carry like 10 anti-venom while leveling
---
Ratchet, on the way out to kill pirates.
---
LOL, silly labels. Remember, only grizzled salty classic Warcraft veterans can criticize the game.
---
Summarizing China, feudal empire, etc themes as "panda themes" is pretty off the mark.
---
Hardiness was nerfed to 15% but you could get it back up to 20% with a gem so really it was just a 5% nerf. And Warriors could get 40% stun resist with talents. 
---
You saw many Undead Rogues in TBC because WoTF became really valuable in arena. Resisting the odd stun in arena wasn’t a big deal, but getting out of a fear on command was huge.
---
Orc racial still good in TBC, with meta gem you can get 20% stun res, so it's only a 5% nerf. People go UD for looks tbh, BC had more rogues than locks imo, so the stun resist was nice.
---
Hello There!  
---
I am looking for friends I guess, gaming buddies if you will. Almost none of my friends group has overlapping gaming time anymore it seems. I'm not looking for a guild for Classic right now, just looking for someone or people to play with, maybe a friendship will develop and we will roll up in Classic together too.  
---
I live in Arizona, I'm on usually from give or take 5-11 on weekdays, most of saturday, and from noon to night on sundays. Unless I am going out for plans, movies, food, etc. But a typical day this will be my typical schedule.  
---
Are you on for alot of overlapping time? If so, let's talk from there!
---
Man that sucks, a 25% reduction in AP when it fades..........
---
I guess I'll reroll Undead in TBC :)
---
It was the trendy slur on private servers. But people are going to discover pretty darn quick that blizzard classic, the community, the atmosphere, are nothing like what was on private servers.
---
Sorry, durotar and barrens for me.
---
Damn that was an impressive leap in aggression at the end
---
Agreed. Grim was pretty shit compared to today’s standards. Jumping all over the place while his target is stun locked missing out on multiple auto attacks, vids made me cringe.
---
They’re pretty good in PvP especially world pvp.
---
Tbh I love these zones but I can’t pretend I have much connection to wow’s soundtrack. I think it’s too subtle.
---
Will do!
---
:)
---
No, they don't. They have more VERTICES.
---
And, the new textures have more TEXELS.
---
But, the amount of pixels occupying by the model, depends on the observer. If you zoom in, or display it in greater resolution, every model will have more pixel.
---
Somehow assuming that a hunter will get the drop on the warrior isn't really fair.
---
Yeah, I'm curious how they're going about making sure everything's in there. Surely it can't be just eyeballing it and memory. Seems like there would be tons of things forgotten if that were the case.
---
Yeah. I said in the post we don’t know lol
---
People have different opinions. Some people want old, others want new. This person is simply saying they want the option. Is that not the same thing that those who want new models would like to have in the game? The option?
---
Because a lot of people hated mop as it added in a LOT of features that murdered the sense of what WoW use to be.
---
I disagree. The skin tone and hair being the same is the only thing similar, and completely my fault for not swapping them around. That particular skin tone darkens lips, eyes, and eyebrows.
---
Mages are best at everything in Classic.
---
The title is a jab at the post on the front page of the sub.
---
6 weeks and you still have holes in your prebis? That's a joke. It really isn't that hard to get as long as you farm the dungeons.
---
Cool. I see from your post history you think naxx will be out at the start as well. I suggest you update your knowledge friend :). Have a nice day
---
None has ever said that prebis is mandatory, but people gear up because it's the responsible thing to do for your raid to ensure as smooth as possible raids.
---
No
---
Ret Pally and Ret Pally,
---
Just love the way they play regardless of where they line up. Considering warlock or enh shaman though too
---
it looks more like a pixar comic movie/book than warcraft
---
Did you read what I wrote? That’s an older version of the ability before 1.12 it will never be that way again. I even linked the change log.
---
Shamans benefit from Horde and Paladin from Allaiance...
---
Woah woah woah. Lets not forget about Nagrand guys.
---
but it's more like retail, tbh. Far too easy.
---
You forgot Resurgence Rod: https://classicdb.ch/?item=17743
---
It released like a year or two after Kung fu panda.
---
It was about pandas that knew kung fu.
---
He's saying that the lack of an option in Retail to show old or new models is 'laughable'. Even though they design new content with the new models, and not old.
---
He's also saying either "only old models" OR "option to switch from new to old", not "I want the option"
---
He's also saying "If it's only new, I'll play Runescape"
---
Which is the source of my ire, and the reason I responded at all.
---
So, no, in the strictest sense, it's not. And even then, there are people who swear they won't play if there is an option and they don't force everyone into the old models, because "it's my character and I want it to look the way I picked, not the way it looks with new models, even if I can't see it." This guy isn't saying this exactly, but he's not far off either.
---
Disclaimer: for the most part I liked the vast majority of the model updates for NPCs, players, and creatures. Or rather, I should say I was not *disappointed* or *unhappy* with all but a handful of them, and would love to be able to toggle them in Classic.
---
That said, I don't really get what's so hard to understand about why some people don't like it. Art and taste are rather subjective. Some people prefer the older art, and it's a fact that some of the player faces especially were interpreted differently from where I would have taken them, and the same goes for a lot of other players. My paladin's face did not look recognizable after the update. I, personally, did not mind, but I can understand somebody else feeling bummed that they can't recreate their character because none of the faces look similar. My warlock's face looked nothing like the one I picked, but I found a different face that did look similar (to me) so it worked out (for me).
---
I don't like a lot of the new animations. They're too "busy". A little too much bounce in their step, faces are a little more expressive than I would have liked during certain idle, casting, or other animations. I feel like there was a little too much emphasis on adding more animations where previously there were none, and one-upping those that did exist rather than simply making more fluid recreations of the old ones.
---
I think it's an objective fact that some of the models do not look merely like an exact HD replica of the original. I can understand why some people would take issue with this. Character creation is an important part of the game. It's why we have customization options, why transmog was later added. To log in one day and find your character unrecognizable and none of the other options make it look like your old character again is, I should think quite understandably, a bummer for a lot of people.
---
And some people just feel like the art style has changed direction (understandable, lots of vanilla devs etc aren't developing WoW anymore) and they just happen to not enjoy the current aesthetic because, again, preference and taste in art is very subjective.
---
Mordhau on steam released on Friday.
---
ShadowPanther no way man!!!  I cant believe it's you.  I used your website all the time what, like 10+ years ago?.  You had great content!  I recently came across your site again but I figured you'd quit and move on.  Small world! Brings back so many memories.  
---
BTW - in TBC/Wrath, I found your website invaluable.  It helped me A LOT.  Thank you!!!!
---
I think people might also get lost in its windy, meandering design and turn back. It’s not quite as bad coming from the tunnel from Ashenvale, but coming from the Barrens one very quickly starts to wonder, “where the hell am I going”. Also doesn’t help that Sun Rock Retreat is so easy to miss… if you don’t see the signs pointing to it you could walk right by it 50 times and never know.
---
By contrast, Redridge has a very straightforward design: the main path leads you right to a hill where the flight path, main town, and the first half of the zone are all visible, and the rest of the zone is a simple loop design.
---
It's hardly a surprise. I'm not an 8 year old and know what will happen in the game. If you're digging into the graphics and not age there are plenty of succesful indie games with okay or pixel graphics. Corpse Party, Dead Cells, Celeste, Moonlighter, Pillars of Eternity and the list goes on.
---
It's okay if graphics are important to you but there's no point telling others they should be if these people clearly don't really care about them. It's hard to talk about it if we're having opposite perspectives or whatever to call it.
---
yes i didnt know about the phases, heard it would be launched as is and im very happy that blizz has release progressively
---
&gt; update your knowledge  
---
what knowledge needs to be updated?
---
You’re not sorry don’t lie
---
Yeah, from the big picture it is, but not from the point of a single expansion when you are playing it, especially considering that Arthas together with a scourge was much more interesting than all this emotional therapy Sha thingy.
---
wrath baby
---
im very affraid those might ruin the game by wishing for more QOL and asking for a "middle ground" between classic and retail.
---
God i hope so
---
I dont understand the gatekeeping of this place sometimes. Youre right
---
He was a single character.
---
I don't know, denizens of PvE servers still seem to hate the term "carebear".
---
And you're just going to ignore that Chen was in the Warcraft franchise, well before Kung Fu Panda released? MoP was also 4 years after the release of Kung Fu Panda (2008 vs 2012). 
---
It's alright if you didn't like the expansion, but equating it to Kung Fu Panda is pretty disingenuous at a minimum.
---
I get what your asking but classic is largely about the classic experiences.  
---
Balancing would break the classic experience and make it something else. Would you also make Druids and Paladins viable main tanks for raids?
---
The Savage Gladiator chain depends on if we're getting progressive itemization or strictly 1.12 item values.
---
You're bringing as much ranged dps as you do melee.  If you stack warriors because they do 5% more dps you will take teice as long to gear your raid resulting in slower progression.  
---
They wont be doing balancing updates.
---
Yes with rare drops and a banner that can be raised with a world buff if you kill a opposing leader
---
I do understand why some people don't like them. I, for one, don't like the new animations either due to personal taste. My only confusion is when people like to say that the new models don't feel like "Warcraft" anymore, or they don't feel "authentic". Looking at W3, the art style of that feels a lot closer to the new models to me, so it feels like a silly complaint. It's okay for someone to just say they don't like something without feeling the need to defend it.
---
The topic though was just a jab at the one on the front page of the sub. It's a disingenuous meme, and I feel that it's unfair to pit someone against the new models if they've never seen them before then.
---
This post is a reflection of my soul.
---
Honestly, when it comes to healing unless you're in a min max guild it isnt that big of a deal. What makes this statement funny is I'm REALLY not in favor of off specs for dps. Usually folks that run PvP healing specs are still good enough to pull it off in PvE. The same is most certainly not true for those who attempt, quite poorly I must add, off spec dps. Also, having enough healers consistently show up for 40 mans is hard enough. Dps is always a dime a dozen. Why take a terrible ret Pally when you can take a terrible pure dps? The floor for a terrible ret Pally is God awful terrible. The floor for most pure dps classes is at LEAST double if not triple that of a terrible off spec that is terribly played
---
That particular dude is actually a high elf, along with Haleh in Winterspring. I don't know if there are any real bloodelves in vanilla, there probably are somewhere.
---
Chen was a singular character, not enough imo to base an entire expansion around.
---
Also Kung fu panda 2,3,4 and 5 are all a thing.
---
It was being released nearly alongside the second movie.
---
Wew lad
---
Is that rock you're living under heavy?
---
It's been talked about a *lot*. For now, the goal is to replicate 1.12 vanilla as faithfully as possible. After that, we'll cross that bridge when we get there.
---
You can tell he plays a mage and doesn't actually understand how expensive food is lol.
---
 play ~~Runescape classic~~ EQ Progression Server and have my friends text me "hey bro did you hear about this new game coming out?"
---
It felt like an expansion on top of Cata, as far as mechanics go. So, they were more fleshed out ideas from Cata, but many of them felt dull to me. I played a pally, and you'd think having holy power would make things more exciting. I think it did the opposite, I just felt like a shittier rogue. Most of what made classes exciting to me were their strengths and weaknesses, and every expac Wrath and onward made every strength less of a focal point, and every weakness filled in with a new ability or feature.
---
Even if it did do damage, it would not do enough damage to out-dps health regen from spirit.
---
&gt; Would you also make Druids and Paladins viable main tanks for raids?
---
They probably would have been if we had a few more patches before TBC since that's the way they ended up trending.
---
Massive repair bill? You are wearing cloth....
---
Honestly, this is strictly a subjective thing. Neither of you are right or wrong. My preference is the new models, that said, they arent perfect and they brutally fucked up a lot, including ALL Nelf males lol. That said, its not a deal breaker for me, and if its the case that theyll work on new models later, im okay with that
---
typo, meant to say enh.
---
Someone else thought so, too...
---
If you don't see the problem with these cartoony, over-exaggerated, emotive-to-the-point-of-being-comical animations, nobody here is going to be able to help you; you're a lost cause.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go8eJuc_6kc
---
‘Current’ geared warriors are always a threat. 
---
When arcanite reaper is considered a good weapon a priest/mage is at like 2.2-2.4k health, iirc. 
---
When bre/sulfuras are best, clothies are low 3000s.
---
Once you get unstoppable force, even t2 characters can be tackled. (292 top end, bre is 310? DTC is 300 spinal reaper 305)
---
Am I the only one who doesn't even remember the last time he has heard any kind of sound effects in WoW? I've had them muted for over a decade now oO
---
&gt; Tauren are completely ruined. They were so badass before. Run animation legit looks like it came out of a backyardigans genre cartoon or something. Favorite race before, can’t stand em now. Looking forward to playing them again in classic.
---
[You don't like these?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go8eJuc_6kc) lol
---
Have played a Warrior, Shaman, Priest and Mage. Been playing private servers on an off for close to a decade. Will be playing a rogue this time around. I am a truly awful rogue. The mindset of one is super foreign to me. It makes them very hard to play for me so I wanna master it.
---
loch modan, barrens, westfall, redridge mountains, STV, ashenvale, thousand needles, tanaris, elwynn forest, wetlands. I actually think almost every zone in vanilla wow is amazing. seriously they're all really well done and interesting in their own ways.
---
&gt;on YouTube
---
So, compilations of him getting crits and trinket procs.
---
As a bit of a completionist I also like to bust out all the achievements in certain games (WoW was never one of those games though lol).
---
I don't think there are any plans to add any achievements to classic. That said, most likely somebody will develop an achievement addon for those of us who want to go full spreadsheet nerd and itemize all the milestones in classic and keep track of them lol
---
I know people say "you wear your achievements" or "you have a rep tab, equip slots, etc" but that doesn't track or display how many squirrels I OCD killed one afternoon, no loremaster title, no explorer tabard. I'm not advocating putting achieves into classic, just hoping somebody makes an addon to help me keep track for myself lol
---
It definitely is subjective. There's pluses and minuses for each set of models for sure.
---
Graphical-fidelity-wise, they're (mostly) fine.  I'd argue male humans look awful.
---
The animations are almost unanimously horrific though, IMO.  For every race.
---
Again, KFP 2 was May 2011, MoP was September 2012. So almost a year and a half later, not alongside. KFP 3 was 2016. 
---
You are still ignoring the actual theme of MoP, which was feudal China. Yes, there are martial arts in China. Yes, there are pandas in China. But there is so much more to the expansion themes that you are willfully ignoring. 
---
I'll reiterate; if you didn't like the expansion, that's fine. But trying to claim MoP = Kung Fu Panda is disingenuous at best, and quite frankly shows you struggle to grasp anything more than one singular theme that you've been fed via memes.
---
I’m totally okay with tweaking classic...on the next server reset.
---
Next time let’s remove the debuff limit, buff raid mob health as required.
---
After that and seeing new numbers with specs able to use all their abilities, maybe there is a balance update reset.
---
Blah blah blizzard used to patch d2 like once a year or so with a ladder reset.
---
Make vanilla like ladder resets, and take 3 years to collect and analyse data and feedback and make measures changes.
---
dude this community kinda sucks.
---
I always felt the hybrid tax was a bad design choice, and too heavy handed.  Putting in the same amount of effort for around 60% of the viability of a 'pure' class isn't right.  80% seems about right to me.
---
On top of that, warriors weren't even subjected to the hybrid tax, they were allowed to be top DPS and top tanks.
---
People want to play Classic. No one claims it's perfect game but private servers got big numbers for a reason. The game is good despite having its negatives. If you want to change it feel free to play with the game files and make your own version. 
---
I just want to play Classic on a server that won't dissappear. If that's not what you want, you won't like the game.
---
TBH that axe is pretty shit for most melee classes. It's worse than WW Axe or Bonebiter for warriors. Bonebiter also for pallys/shamans. 
---
The axe is meh.
---
Stopped playing 6 mos into TBC....so I guess I'm in the first expansion group? 12 years?
---
Teldrassil music always will hold a special place in my heart. Chills and nostalgia hit me when I hear it.
---
Oh yeah, no I think the "warcraft style" is still adequately maintained and people complaining about that are just trying too hard to defend a subjective opinion that does not require defending and validating. Totally agree there.
---
In Classic your gear and your reputation is your achievements. If you need some arbitrary point system to keep you playing, then that game already exists for you.
---
Only thing that pisses me off about the new models is the animations. Like the fucking troll male run animation. So dumb and bouncy whence before it was slow and lumbering.
---
Oh and the Undead male having their weapons shrink by half when they're sheathed on the back.
---
As a tauren only player I have to disagree.
---
Ah ok. Had a nostalgia blast, guild on my server back in like 2007
---
The reason I didn’t like the expansion is because it doesn’t belong in the Warcraft universe.
---
It’s main focus was pandaren monks, granted there were other factors.
---
Overall, this expansion was a cash grab for Chinese players and children and the story is some of the worst, besides the time traveling bullshit.
---
MoP should have never existed.
---
https://youtu.be/YS-vwAGZBik?t=28
---
Also, no.
---
Something like this would he cool. I'd also not mind seeing a new server rolled out with new content for classic.
---
The possibilities are quite vast but nothing is being made public...
---
better racials ez
---
"I'm excited, not obsessed lololol" I say as I update my private blog full of classic resources, class guides, quest routes, auction house stuff, profession guides, while refreshing the official forums several times a day to check the blue tracker for any official updates.
---
Yes, lots of classes have Hybrid\* PvE/PvP specs that get a lot of play. Nobody wants to full respec just to run a few BGs, so it lets you be 90% viable in both scenarios.
---
You pick up your crucial PvP talents while keeping your raiding efficiency talents. Best way to do it.
---
They dont like it, but you right. "Furries" know how to do anthro faces, as much at they hate it.  The OG female tauren face may be one of the least detailed, blockiest things ing vanilla wow.
---
Well, I've been waiting for classic WoW since Cataclysm
---
For paladins, there's a quest in Ungoro crater that rewards a boomerang tricket.
---
That's the only ranged pull available to paladins, so it's definitely worth getting.
---
They have done so for two years now, I don't think Blizzard will cater to them.
---
Still have it in retail after all these years. Blizzard removed most the other "toys" e.g. a staff equippable by rogues but thankfully left it in.
---
I'd rather dance naked on the fountain
---
Please be right about that..
---
Your the lost cause lol. Wow has always been "the cartoony mmo" literally a big criticism from the old days.  New tauren models are objectivly better.
---
Very few: http://classicdb.ch/?items=2&amp;filter=ty=13;#0-4+1
---
Whats a cooldown check
---
[The worst is Tauren.](https://imgur.com/a/oT8bLiF) I used to love playing them, but I just can't bring myself to do it with the new models. Look at those doofy grins.. I hear Banjo's guffaw in my brain every time I see them.
---
Say what you want about the old potato tauren female models but at least they looked neutral. Tauren are stereotypically supposed to be stoic and proud, like idealized, archetypal native Americans.
---
Why isn't he playing on a private server right now?
---
I decide if I'm right, and you decide if I'm right, we all do based on how we all contribute to the community
---
Oh me too. Sooo much bounce. Definitely not my cup of tea.
---
Bring your Nostalgic memories back! We were on Andorhal PvP back in the day 2005-2009/10ish.
---
Iirc, enrage could not be triggered using /sit in the demo.
---
actually i see a lot of UD females
---
What is so good about the staff that it would be better than a normal weapon?
---
Well your speaking towards the general class homogenization that began mostly in WoTLK and has carried through the game since. So yes thats a well known issue people have but relative to the other expansions in the "homogenized" era, MOP was pretty damn good with class identity, mechanics and feel.
---
Mop was pretty awesome tbh. shame they didn't make the pandas super edgey like DH and they'd have received a better response
---
I don’t think there is an equivalent, but horde should DEFINITELY get it.
---
Theyre not fine lol. You have high tier Blizzard employees consistently mentioning how Vanilla was totally incomplete in terms of balance. All specs were meant to be viable at all tiers (not equal, just viable). I recommend you listen to Kevin Jordan’s interviews on Countdown to Classic in the episodes where he covers Druids and Paladins. Paladin tanks, Ret dps, moonkin, bear tank are definitely NOT viable as main tanks or dps in raids.
---
Do you need another friend?
---
Ok, tourist
---
You need to be really special to worry about that.
---
I never said I agreed with the Hybrid tax and quite frankly it's bullshit that Warriors, as you said, the top Tanks and almost the top DPS.
---
But Druids are a whole other thing as they are capable of using almost all of their skills regardless of what specc they are in and their utility is insane.
---
If things were changed up, they would have to lock certain skills behind certain speccs which would bring us back to Retail.
---
blessed_wow

https://i.redd.it/gr3xmh9ky9s21.png
---
The link is the raid distribution on private servers. 
---
It's not quite as bad as you picture it but there is an over representation of warriors.
---
When you count melee (warrios and rogues) vs. ranged (hunter/warlock/mage) then it's pretty much evenly spread.

Let's stay to facts and discuss from that instead of making up our own imaginative numbers.
---
While you can not charge in combat, in PVP it is possible to drop combat and then charge them again.
---
I don't care about the graphics that much I just wish we had more variety with the model sizes. I'm sick of every human looking like they've been benching 500kg everyday for the past 10 years.
---
I used to watch some Discovery Science
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoMMrM7m1ps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoMMrM7m1ps) 
---
and, if I recall correctly, dealing with graphics card drivers causing problems with The Sims 2.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlsVYgxj12c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlsVYgxj12c) 
---
I thought it was because of software, so I decided to install a Service Pack for the first time in my life. I recall getting a CD from friend, with it. But, it was a full Windows XP installer, just with SP2. Still, I could use the "Upgrade" option.
---
Since it was just a service pack, the sound card drivers were already working. That's the first time I heard this:
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKricIeeru0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKricIeeru0) 
---
That graphics card card died next February. Probably because of overheating, but well, I was not too educated on that back then. Well, at least I could finally use ultra settings, with the new card. With 25fps, but still, that was something I called "smooth".
---
Also, after watching The Return of the King, I was touched with this song:
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoVaK2NXmJA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoVaK2NXmJA) 
---
and made more research into the entire soundtrack from all three parts
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7MLT4MmAK8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7MLT4MmAK8) 
---
That's the time when I started to learn that Elvish. Mæ govannen, mellon.
---
This one was popular in the radio:
---
Also, I was starting to get into Druidism, and generally Druid things. So, class choice was obvious. Even though I had to be some weirdly-looking Night Elf, not looking any close to how Druids look like, I got used to it.
---
I don't expect many tourist to make it past lvl 30, and definitely not to lvl 60.
---
If a retail player makes it to 60, that's fine they are likely going to have realized while leveling up to 60 how different classic is than retail, and will likely be more willing to learn again.
---
Water totem quest line for shamans
---
Who ever told you the shaman thing has never been a horde mage. Trying to kite some one with cleanse being spammed on them. Or with BoF rolling. Same with warlocks. Yea an alliance warlock don't run into will of the forsaken. However they do run head first into cleansing bubble boys. So it's all relative.
---
The only class in the entire game that should really have an opinion is rogue. Paladins truley and completely suck for rogues lol.
---
What he said is still true of that as well.
---
There's a guy who is considered to be one of the best tanks for vanilla/classic; his name is Skarm. In some of his videos he goes into detail on why you \*don't need\* to be def capped.   
---
The TL;DR is that if you stack all mitigation and no threat, you won't have a good time tanking. 
---
Also, It's worth noting that Skarm has a build he uses called fury-prot; it's a threat alternative to deep prot. I think that looking him up might be worth your time.
---
Vanilla private server?
---
Do we have any information as to how loottables are going to change during the phases? I.e. is the Ancient Petrified Leaf going to be available right away, even though it was only added in 1.4?
---
No point in a vanilla setting if they change it. Excitement around vanilla is directly related to the original e state they plan to bring back changing it would trigger me and a lot of others and I would not play it just like I don't play retail
---
You also said private servers had it wrong
---
Can't believe he thought Might and a two-hander would be good enough to tank Arthas.
---
Living Action Potions aren't in the game until ZG, patch 1.7, so they won't be around for World PvP ranking etc.
---
The warlock class is particularly good solo. It's a pretty self-reliant class like hunters. But I would say out of all classes, any class that can heal would benefit a warlock best. So priest, paladin, or druid would all work best to duo with a warlock. 
---
Keep in mined that in endgame raiding/groups, the priest, paladin, and druid will most likely not be invited to raid/groups unless you can be the healer. So generally speaking shadow priests, ret paladins, and feral druids or boomkins aren't going to be invited to end game raids or 5 man groups unless you are spec'd to heal.
---
I mained a druid in vanilla retail until early Cataclysm. I can tell you first hand they definitely cannot do everything at the same time.  If you have decent sets for each role you can switch between them giving a lot of flexibility, but your actual performance for an offspec role will be like 40% of a 'pure class' at best (meaning basically full consumes).
---
Never happened
---
It was an incredibly stupid thing  especially for RP to not be able to remove your helm and cloak when entering and inn to sit at a table. Now you have to go back to the xmogger? How ridiculous. 
---
But it’s par for the course of blizzard introducing new shit and then failing to update/patch/support it. 
---
The current game is just so packed with bullshit it’s hard to keep up.
---
Imagine taking the single coolest casting animation (undead male) and butchering it with a new model. It looks weak on the new model, somehow. The old model undead male casting animation looked badass and strong.
---
If a tourist enjoys the sights and the journey, they belong!

You know as well as I do that Blizzard does not specifically state what is reportable in terms of “griefing”....it boils down to their interpretation of “player conduct”. 
---
Corpsecamping IS part of the game and Blizz has stated multiple times that it’s allowed.  I’ve camped and been camped my fair share of times.
---
If we’re not supposed to complain to “mr daddy”, how do you expect the game to get better?  Do you like all the racist/homophobic/sexist comments that permeate the pservers?  
---
If there is something that I find offensive whether it be griefing/language/whatever, I’m taking the 2 minutes to report it.  It’s up the the GMs to sort it out and issue punishment if it’s deemed necessary by them.  I’m not complaining to “my daddy”, I’m trying to make the game I love playing better.
---
My wife will be rolling a hunter. Not the best supporting class for a warrior probably. She has had everything about her character decided since the blizzcon announcement lol. I'm the indecisive one on this end.
---
Again, I disagree. But I do know people loved their classes in MoP at the time, especially coming from Cata. I’m not even saying you’re wrong, I wish I could appreciate every expac like some others. A lot of that class feel to me, comes from those strengths and weaknesses. Wrath DID start that trend, gave some people minor AOE, cooldowns, etc... but most classes still had glaring weaknesses. No AoE heal for holy pallies for example. 
---
But when the game mechanics and philosophy change as a whole, the class I’m playing suffers as a result. So while I think Cata added a shitty combo point system for pallies, MoP *expanded* on it. Kind of how people argue the Azerite system is expanding on Artifacts. It might be worse or better, but when you hate the system to begin with, it’s problematic.
---
Thanks for the kind words. I’m glad you’ve found my site to be useful. I came back when I heard about Classic and restored all of my old charts and guides back to their 1.12 state.
---
From 2005-2013, I continuously updated various resources on the site from expansion to expansion, but at a certain point I simply couldn’t keep up with the all of the endless changes to gear, mechanics, etc. With Classic, everything should remain fairly static, so I won’t have to worry about constantly updating multiple resources with each patch change. That allows me to spend time on other projects, like my current quest completionist guide.
---
Copy that.  Read it too fast.
---
I never understood how someone could move away to college and THEN move back in to their parents house.
---
&gt; assuming good gear and skill
---
Blizzard has a working version of 1.12 running internally for reference.  Most of the development work as I understand it involves rebuilding that code and data structure according to modern standards.

Warlock PvE is waaaay smoother on Alliance due to Salvation.

Thought I'd link this video here as I haven't seen anyone talking about it since it came out. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U67psLSdLQ0) the separate video by the same guy comparing level 19 twink armor.
---
i havent read all the changes, i usually just play. is there a big list somewhere?
---
am winning again!
---
You do realize WoW was basically called "Cartoony" back when it released, right? They are just keeping the theme. Oh, and most of the emotes were  *supposed* to besilly/over-exaggerated anyhow
---
Cool, thanks for sharing, I want to roll a druid alt and was wondering about specs for pvp and pve.
---
Yeah, like when people would report you for saying "ass" or "shit" and you'd get a warning on your account for it (I got a 3 hour ban once for saying "holy shit"). It sure was a more hard-skinned time back then, populated with internet tough-guys /s
---
Even if it cant be solod, 2 hunters should be able do it together, each taking a mob. 
---
The 2 end bosses are slower than an AotC hunter speed. So even with updated pathing a hunter can out run them in a big circle. Each hunter can take one of them.
---
I'm not really looking into stat bonuses like that. 
---
I've always loved night elves from warcraft 3, so they're my preferred race.
---
Thanks for the recommendation though.
---
I played pally in vanilla... getting kited constantly was horrible.   I fucking hated shamans.
---
I'm going to go with a different class this time around.
---
That's actually a Swedish nyckelharpa (keyed fiddle)! You can hear the wooden keys clacking in the background.
---
"Alright, now shamans. Each of you pop mana tide totem so we know you aren't cutting corners on helping the raid with your spec. If we don't see you cast it, then you're not full resto"
---
You also have to deduct a bit from warriors are some of them are the tanks.
---
If you think you didn't get banned for saying naughty things back then you're fucking delusional. Blizzard practically had a zero-tolerance policy for profanity, even WITH the profanity filter option.
---
The people getting high AND playing classic WoW? They’re more powerful than we could ever hope to imagine.
---
I'm not a fan of the threat changes that made Warrior fotm in 1.12. But I'm even less thrilled with the idea of going down the class banace/change rabbit hole.
---
Maybe later down the road after Classic has launched, proven itself to be stable, authentic, etc, many of us might be more amenable to actually discussing things like this. But Blizz has a track record of taking a mile when given an inch. I can use daily quests as an example. Mists: I feel there are too many dailies to choose from and find myself having a hard time picking and choosing where to start, and additionally that I have to grind too many factions just to gear for heroics. Their answer in WoD? Like 5 dailies, and it randomly picks 3 each day that you can complete.
---
I, personally, am super hesitant for the community to encourage Blizz to make some tiny change because my experience has shown me there's a good chance they'll run wild with it.
---
There are alot of things.
---
I would argue against good ppl its nice to be ally rogue (no pala , no dwarfs), and as a ganking rogue its nice to be horde (no orcs, wotf).
---
But the biggest thing in classic WoW that benefit from faction AND race is shadowpriest.
---
Ud Shadowpriest have DP and dont have to fight shamans and UDs that so huge.
---
Alliance warlocks will have the benefit of paladin threat blessings, giving them more dps than horde.
---
Yeah, but still, it's gotta be something more sophisticated than having 1.12 on one monitor and classic alpha on the other, right?
---
Maybe it's something like plug in a 1.12 function into the modern codebase and see what breaks or something like that.
---
Sneaky stealth. You stun lock. Will you let him go? 
---
UN-DEAD ROGUE NOOOO! WE WILL NOT LET YOU GO!
---
Found the Pserver player.
---
What about pve?
---
Alliance warlocks will have the benefit of paladin threat blessings, giving them more dps than horde in pve.
---
Rofl.
---
Theres quite a bit more who didn’t though
---
just waiting for classic. I have not played wow since late cata. I have tried a few private servers in the meantime. Have a couple friends interested in retail vanilla, but i'd like to get chummy with a few more
---
I'd been going back and forth between playing hunter again and playing a rogue. 
---
Was on hunter for a while actually. But someone here said something along the lines of "new class so it's a new experience rather than replaying what I played before". And that kinda stuck with me.
---
How is the "option to switch from new to old" different from " I want the option "? You literally used the exact same word. Also why does someone else's gameplay preferences cause you ire? As for your last paragraph, he's pretty far off from that, actually. Again, he clearly wants the option to choose the models and animations he wants. We all want the option. Can Blizz make it happen? I don't know, but why get so upset that this person would choose a different option than you if given the choice?
---
I think that was changed in late Vanilla, no? I know there used to be a very complicated way of aoe farming the SM dungeons for insane exp
---
I find it amazing. Mainly because of lore. The whole Arthas/Lordaeron/Scourge thing is awesome.
---
Yeah for real.  I rolled a rogue alt at some point in BC I think, and came across your site.  It was instrumental in getting me up to speed, particularly since I was such a noob at the time.  I had no idea haha.  Turned out to be a good decision because rogue ended up being my most fun PVP class to play.  It was a blast.  
---
Really appreciate the good work.  I will dissect your spreadsheets when I have more time.  Kudos!
---
Which did mean that every time you got to visit Shadowprey Village it felt 10x better to be there, had this sort of safe feeling over it! I loved stuff like that.  
---
Overal though, fuck Desolace.
---
Classic is not a Pserver. So, a lot of what you think you know is wrong.
---
Pick a class based on the three specs you’ll want to play and master. A mediocre priest will never do well.
---
I feel quite comfortable around rogues, lvling my paladin. Can't say the same for hunters or shamans, and mages can't be a bitch too.
---
The magic that is Vanilla though, I'll do it again, and somehow find a reason to love it.
---
True, but isn't your character sitting there for a while if the player chooses not to skip the little intro cinematic?
---
They won IMO
---
I wouldn't call those players tourists, but I agree with the sentiment.
---
By far the biggest factor is how much a given class benefits from having paladin/shaman and the implications of the opposing team having paladins/shamans. 
---
Every class has benefits and drawbacks from being on either faction and in pvp none are objectively better in all situations. (Pve is a different story, blessings are usually op compared to totems)
---
For example warriors gain tremendous offensive power from being horde thanks to windfury totem, but that comes at the cost of not having access to paladin blessings. The biggest for warriors being freedom. The bane of a warriors existence is being slowed and kited. (Horde warriors can circumvent this with free action potions but those can be dispelled and then you’re fucked) so you’d have to choose, would you rather have big dick damage when you get to stick to people as horde or would you prefer to have better mobility and overall stats thanks to paladins. 
---
As a side note, in my opinion racials matter much less than paladins/shamans. Racials only really make a big difference in 1v1’s where a well timed will of the forsaken or lucky stun resist will likely make the difference between winning or losing. In team battles it’s very unlikely to be the determining factor.
---
&gt; You'd better enter MC in whatever gear week 2 after release than wait 6 weeks and still have holes in your pre-bis.
---
1. You can only clear MC once a week. And the chance of you getting loot out of a raid of 40 is relatively low. 
---
2. A few months after release many guilds are hesitant to bring freshly dinged 60s into raids, they expect you to gear up at least a bit in dungeons before. 
---
3. You have never been meant to get exactly everything on your pre-bis list before trying to raid. It's just a tool people use to gear up more easily and effectively. If you know where the best items for your class drops you can prioritise dungeons that way, instead of running stuff that only gives mediocre loot. 
---
4. Some pre-bis items are better than anything that drop in MC.
---
Vanilla's balance is very underestimated for some reasons
---
In PVP you can pretty much play anything, there is nothing weak
---
In PVE there are a few bad specs (ret, elem, balance, enhancement) but most of the specs are fine and you obviously won't be bringing only warriors and rogues dps is not the most important, utility is.
---
Elem and balance are even somewhat playable in pve if you're not min maxing that much, enhancement is fine with nighfall. So only ret is really bad, but not even unplayable bad if you're not a tryhard guild.
---
Not enough to justify “pretty much everyone”
---
Or we could encourage people to enjoy the game and not gatekeep like children :)
---
All set in my mind that I'm rolling Horde. Then I hear this, and now I don't know!
---
✔️ I'm in this picture and I don't like it.
---
tl;dr: Look at the Tier 1 raid set and see what it's geared for. That's the spec that Blizzard themselves set out to make viable for raids. 
---
Anything else is going to be an uphill battle. That's why Druids and Shammys are mostly expected to heal, their sets are obviously geared towards that.
---
The "Totems of the Grizzlemaw" track is my all-time favorite piece of music, and will bring tears to my eyes a strong 85% of the time I hear it.
---
Same thread 2hours ago, scoll down abit.
---
aww yeah
---
I have a pserver level 52 Priest. What spec should I try?
---
Wish I could roll belf.  :(
---
&gt; but you can bet your ass they'll be doing mc in greens the first week
---
And you can bet your ass they will be grinding dungeons for pre-bis any time they are not raiding MC, which is most of the time.
---
For The Horde!  
---
For The Alliance!
---
guys, tryhard pvpers
---
I am abit of a duel/1v1 nerd, i just love duelling infront of OG, i did a small sheet what i think generally, i rated the class in duels and open world 1v1 what i thought. The Number is more or less the effort the class has to put in to beat the other class for example in the Shadowpriest vs Mage matchup its in favor of the Priest so 60% ("winchance") so the Mage has to put in abit of effort to beat the SP for example with the same skill a nate and UD as a race could be able to decide the match in favor of the Mage :

---
pls dont take everything there with a grain of salt, i did the spreadsheet more or less for me to help me with my class pick.
---
You are absolutely right.  Honestly I don't trust current Blizz to balance things correctly.
---
Druid. Benefiting from the awesome look of Night Elves, plus being the same race as the elites of Cenarion Circle, and generally, being the master race of all things to Trees and Nature. Plus, wisp spirit makes Night Elves the master race, anyway. Unfortunately, the decombatbug racial doesn't work in vanilla - Shadowmeld can be used only out of combat.
---
Paladin. Benefiting from its existence. Same as shaman.
---
And warlock, as long as you don't hate gnomes, like any mentally capable member of the Alliance does.
---
Hunter, because Alliance starting zones have better pets.
---
I will say that I raided as a warlock in BC and boy, that was fun... if you wanted to keep it up! In Vanilla I raided as a mage and with the rolling fireball ticks in BWL you felt like a god.
---
wtf why?
---
Jup free 40 mount. Quest was worth it. It truly gave you a reward worth working for.
---
i used the Naga Hex for ages and now using the new Model with the 7 Buttons on the side. I never could use the Naga because of the small buttons but the HEx is just great
---
i want an authentic vanilla experience which means i am moving back in with my parents and exclusively clicking my skills
---
I think like most things, choosing Druid is what you make of it.  There’s no reason why you can’t be an active member in end game content on any spec as long as you put in the time and effort to make your contributions meaningful.  I don’t understand the mentality that if your favorite spec/style isn’t the flavor of the month, then it brings no value.
---
yes
---
&gt; and will have had months to get some dungeon drops.
---
Which is what pre-bis lists are for. Don't think anyone has ever said you need pre-bis to be able to do MC, it's a notoriously easy raid. But you would still look at pre-bis lists while gearing up *after* your first MC kill.
---
I was always bothered by how the new orc model beards looked.
---
Oh yeah for sure in PvP, PvE on the other hand.....
---
I wonder how many prospective Classic players are returning Vanilla players. I'd say "let's do a poll" but that would invite so much gatekeeping... best not to.
---
If they kick me, I won't trade it away.
---
Oh my dear soyboy.. You do what you got to do man. As to any negative loaded comments, I just don’t care / laugh at them for being so dumb. Those people will harm their own reputation in the end. I just severely dislike interventionism. It’s stupid.
---
Dwarf hunters are not rare but the other two yeah.
---
Hunter because I enjoy the class and want to master it. I’ve always wanted to main a hunter on retail but never did. Now I have the fresh start.
---
I’m going to have a shaman alt as well since I like resto shamans.
---
Sorta. In the blizzcon classic panel they said they stuck the 1.12 data into a modern client and then looked to see what broke. They do a side by side comparison for reference/validation.
---
Wow is a much more data driven program than a code driven one. I'm sure there are client adaptions that are needed but most of that is ui and art.
---
Lmao take my upvote
---
We don’t know yet, since it isn’t exactly confirmed how all mechanics will work nor exactly how items will be itemized or located.
---
That said, isn’t figuring out your bis yourself like an integral part of playing an rpg? An mmo? 
---
I guess I don’t understand the obsession with bis lists—to me at least, the process of figuring it out myself is part of the fun
---
I think we will probably remain on reddit too, there always will be some ingame drama worth posting about imo.
---
I mean no matter what they can't fully replicate the classic experience.  Classic launching in 1.12 is already a huge change from what I experienced in 2004, it changes the balance from the get go.  The thing is I don't think current Blizzard could actually balance the game.  So it being patch 1.12 is OK with me, I'll take it for what it is.
---
This is getting frustrating, and I'm not blaming you OP directly but I guess I'm blaming all those know-it-alls who made it sound like Vanilla was way harder in terms of classes than it really was.
---
I have shat on people both in Wpvp and BGs as an undergeared arms warrior with wrong talents.
---
Believe it or not, *SKILL* is what mattered most in Vanilla, not so much gear as it is in retail.
---
Roll warrior, level to 60, learn the basics of the class/spec and just keep playing to get better and earn better gear. You will get rekt but you will also rek equally as much. The 2k+ mortal strike crits are easily achievable with minimal gear. Early-game, most people including plate wearers will have anywhere between 2.6-4k HP.
---
You do the math of how squishy people can get when you've got a big dick damage ability...
---
People really need to fucking relax and just play it without worrying too much. Sorry for the passive aggressive tone of my post but it's just how it is. I love this community but some things are getting too overblown.
---
r/CLASSICWOW **RULES**
---
**1.**  
---
**1. Content must be related to WoW: Classic**
---
That priest definitely looks 60+. Not Classic.
---
&gt;How is the "option to switch from new to old" different from " I want the option "?
---
Because, again, he's not saying only "I want the option", he's saying "Either old models only OR the option".
---
&gt; Also why does someone else's gameplay preferences cause you ire? 
---
It doesn't. If it's a toggle, and he wants to use old graphics, no skin off my back. 
---
&gt; Again, he clearly wants the option to choose the models and animations he wants. 
---
He clearly wants "Not the new models", not clearly wants a choice. 
---
&gt; We all want the option. 
---
No, not everyone wants the option.
---
&gt;  but why get so upset that this person would choose a different option than you if given the choice? 
---
I'm not upset, and I don't care what he chooses if it's a toggle. But the "I'm gonna play runescape if it's new models only" mentality is so dumb. If your entire decision to play Classic or not is down to graphical changes that don't affect gameplay, then you are a moron. Please, don't play. This is not directed at you, the person I am replying to, just a general statement about those that feel this way.
---
Weakest class in the game in terms of raw healing or raw damage. But we have the biggest toolkit. Forget about moonkin but 1 feral per guild is not unusual.  They are good offtanks and somewhat decent at dpsing. A feral druid can be both dps and tank by just switching gear thats why raids bring 1.
---
If you’re rolling a Druid you should definitely go Alliance. They benefit a ton from pally buffs (kings and might), but don’t get anything from Shaman’s windfury.
---
Now I leave Earth for no raisin.
---
Yeah I hear ya.
---
The truth about druids is that you can dance in forms.  Nothing else matters.
---
There are PvP pre-bis lists as well. 
---
At least for warrior there are, but maybe it's not as common for other classes? Warrior PvP and PvE gear is almost entirely different.
---
Yeah agreed, I healed in Vanilla and have tried it in Retail. World of difference. Learning to heal in Retail will not translate to Classic.
---
I saw it aswell but it seems to be deleted, to be fair the answers wasn't that detailed anyway.
---
I really wanted to play druid to heal but a lot of stuff I read has put me off, so I'm think of paladin now.
---
Because it speaks the truth?
---
Mobility and utility are their strengths. Rebirth, Innervate and Faerie Fire are amazing. Speed boost on demand from cat ability is good in every "oh shit" scenario. Bear form is good to tank some dmg when you get jumped on in pvp by melee and poly immunity is such a good cock block vs mages.
---
I quit wow during work then came back for TOC.  I just spammed LFG heroics as a ahitty geared tank (it didnt matter, heroics were a joke) and got a full TOC ready set of epics.  I didnt do a single raid before TOC and it didnt even take me that long.
---
Yeah, sometimes having enough stamina so your healer can manage to get off a heal before you're dead is very important to successful PVP in a premade.
---
No resilience stats and weirdly balanced itemization of gear can make "best" gear far from what does the most damage.
---
Priests are solid. can always find a group for dungeons etc. Gold making is the primary concern. you kind of need one of 2 playstyles. 1. run dungeons have enchanting or alc. to charge for crafting rare enchants/flasks. or you have to go for a more fishing/cooking method which is also good, but some find a bit boring. alc/tailoring have a 3 day cd for guaranteed gold as well.
---
Oh yeah, stonetalon, which made him a great character, got ret on. Blizzard tweeted it was a mistake.
---
Frankly somewhere between 20-30 you stop being a tourist. The tourist spends all day getting to 20 and does wailing caverns or deadmines and never logs in again.
---
you can though, play a private server and wet your whistle
---
Isn’t this from In Dreams? Has a few other BiS items.
---
I've seen several private server vids where they stack rogues and warriors.  You bring one or two of the other classes to mop up any gear for that class.
---
EU or US?
---
They do only in 2 circumstances. The rogue has the best gear available, and 2 knows what he's doing. They can kill a pally 1v1 duel consistently even vs 2 bubbles
---
Ah this is me since February.
---
I just like the vanilla models more, what are you gonna do about it ?
---
Legion had it's flaws, but it was an amazing expansion. I think anyone who played it in its entirety feels the same. The legendary system kind of sucked, but they were still super fun to use, and the mage towers were some of my favorite content ever added into the game.
---
There’s some in azshara too. They were the original models. When tbc released they got switched.
---
This is why I love vanilla. Combining knowledge (obscure items, positioning, etc), grinding, and mechanical skill will always net you the best results
---
As someone who has competed at a high level (&gt;1%) of multiple competitive games, there really isn’t much ‘skill’ involved in WoW. There’s almost nothing that’s mechanically challenging, and things that are ‘sick slomo skillz moments’ in WoW videos like vanishing a blind are just requirements to be even mediocre at a game like league (flashing an ult or skillshot)
---
After reading your chart, if I understand correctly you believe the warlock to be a better open world PvP class than the mage? Could you go into detail a little bit about how you came to this? Or maybe just explain your thoughts a bit between the warlock and the mage, as mage is what I'm considering right now if I go caster DPS.
---
Wowprogress tracks guuld rosters
---
Nope
---
Ahhh it's really gorgeous. Thanks for the info!
---
They can fill a niche role in raiding, pretty good at it though. For PVP, from my memories, they were garbage. If they get BWL+ tanking stuff (All the slots that aren't actual armor) they get very tanky in PVP. Still killable, but it's hard. They don't have enough offense to really kill someone else in that situation either though.
---
I’d assume vanilla players are the primary target for classic. It’s why I’m coming back anyway. A poll wouldn’t reach a large enough audience to get any accurate numbers
---
Agreed. They're just too damn cute. You can argue that the models were always cartoony, and more detail is better, but put the two comparisons next to each other and no one can argue that the newer models are more cutesy. Not a good change for hulking, minotaur beasts.
---
For me its great.  Its a goals list/what to go after. Its something to strive towards.  Each his own I guess.
---
Bro this is some gatekeeping buuuuullshit.
---
I’ve never even heard the term tourist used like this till now and it’s hilarious to me. Maybe I don’t come to these boards often enough to develop that armor. But You really wanna be antagonistic to people that might stick around until they see shit like this post? And lose me with that “if they stick around then they’re not a “tourist”” logic. You should be completely and utterly welcoming to *anyone* who plays the game, religiously or even for an hour.
---
Everytime I see a leveling, pvp or gold farming strategy that relies on specific glitchy-looking pserver tricks I just assume there's going to be serious disappointment/rage afoot
---
You need to specify if this is in duels or group PvP. 1.12 warlocks are a world beater in duels, but their overall effectiveness declines as the number of players on each side increases.
---
Redonculous 😂 👍🏻
---
Hey, I know this is going to come as a surprise, but pretty much everybody sucked back then compared to today's standards. There's a couple outliers like Vurtne but for the most part they are mostly considered 'bad'.
---
Grim was still better, relatively speaking, than the rest of the player base at the time. I'm sure his playstyle will update with the more modern version of the game just like everyone else.
---
No not rly thats why there is a solo pvp section mage is imo better in open world pvp.
---
But the "open pvp" section is only for 1v1, i felt like making one because some classes like hunter or rogue and even druids are way better in open world 1v1 then in duels where they are limited by space or opponent prep.
---
If nothing else, MoP was a blatant pander to a burgeoning chinese playerbase.  That knocks it down a couple pegs.  Not because of who they pandered to, or how they pandered to them, but the very fact that they pandered so obviously.
---
I was there, it was a lot of fun.
---
My main was a hunter. I had the idea to give my pet wolf the plague and then dismiss it before the debuff ended. The next day I summoned my pet in the middle of the AH and everyone got the plague again. It didn't last as long.
---
That sort of behavior wasn't uncommon though. We loved the game but it was a little bit of a mess, and we loved that about it too. Boats would sink, infernos would be banished at the AH, raid lockouts would screw up so you zone in to a cleared MC, you could talk to the opposite faction using non-alphabet characters, etc. The wild west mentality was awesome. But like the BWL exploits or Kazzak kiting, people would eventually catch on so these bugs so they had to be patched up or risk becoming the norm.
---
In vanilla the regen wasn't absurd as it is right now
---
&gt;I don’t understand the mentality that if your favorite spec/style isn’t the flavor of the month, then it brings no value.
---
It's not FOTM. In Vanilla, there were specs that worked, and those that didn't. You don't spec into fire as a Mage and go into MC. Balance Druid offers nothing. They do so little DPS that they might as well not be there.
---
Damn do I look forward to some new fresh youtube videos displaying the ninjalooting of Majordomo's chest!
---
Them nerd screams give me chills hahah
---
Well they call Druids: "jack of all trades, master of none" for a reason, you are not the strongest in anything, but you are versatile.
---
Wrath kiddo, BFA Babby, tourist, freshcuck, vanilla virgin - those are just the ones off the top of my head but I am sure we can cook up some more before launch.
---
Yeah I just read through the entire post. I found about two quality comments. There was still plenty of information to be desired.
---
Westfall chicken, duh
---
Not sure if thats going to be a thing. Didn't blizzard ban most of the mods that make that possible? I know they might have been around back in the day but, I thought blizzard bans that stuff now. Am I wrong?
---
The whole "New models don't fit in the world" argument is akin to the "You only like Vanilla because of nostalgia" argument.
---
I played vanilla private servers for years with updated models patch. Not just character models but mobs as well. It enhanced the vanilla experience so much and it's a damn shame this is not a toggle option.
---
Easily googable. Just Google the blue posts they address different info they've specified.
---
I played Priest and Druid at 60 on Horde with a focus on PvE.
---
It was fun to top healing charts with the Priest while making hard decisions constantly about what spells you should be casting to keep everyone alive.
---
As a Druid it was fun saving the f\*ing day when everything went to hell with battle rez and innervate. Also easier to focus on mechanics because you aren't thinking about spell selection so much.
---
Lol at Hunter and warrior beating rogue. More like they gave a chance to kill a rogue, but not really beat the class.
---
From my understanding (and I played Vanilla WoW but I was 13 and only leveled, no end game.) Druids are just kind of second best at everything.
---
Balance Druids don't do more damage than a Mage or Warlock and have mana issues.
---
Feral Druids require more work and prep than a Rogue for (probably) less of an outcome
---
Bear Druids don't quite have the survivability of a Prot Warrior
---
Resto Druids don't quite have the healing power of a priest or the utility of Paladin/Shaman.
---
So if you were a player/guild trying to min/max why would you bring any of those over the other classes I listed? For their buffs/utility that they bring in which case bring 2 or 3 resto druids and call it a day.
---
But this again just from reading and not exp.
---
I assume you mean in europe, cause  uh... north korea and somalia would like a word otherwise.
---
she was cute ;)
---
Currently smoking a bowl and playing classic on a pserver, am I the chosen one?
---
Ahh, that makes sense. Thanks!
---
I bought one of those $30 MMO mice from Amazon recently because I wasn't sure if I would like it and I didn't want to invest a ton of money into an experiment.
---
So far, I haven't been a huge fan. Part of the reason is that the buttons feel really stiff, which is probably just related to the cheap product.
---
One thing I guess I didn't realize is that the side buttons aren't unique; they essentially duplicate the number keys on the keyboard, so you can't bind them to separate things. I'm curious how other people have gotten around this restriction. I'm guessing you can somehow change the binds on the mouse itself, but if that's an option I'm curious what people even remap it to. Maybe something weird that you'd never use like the Tilde Key + number keys? Can you even rebind to a multi-key combo?
---
This is true but also it will take you 10 times longer than it will take a mage.
---
Because you cannot inspect eachothers tallents sometimes the GM wants proof and lets you cast the ability you got from the final tallent.
---
Shadowmeld is still pretty good on hunters. Feign Death into Shadowmeld is great for soloing instances or the jolly good Aimed Shot from stealth.
---
Is the corsair mmo mouse good aswell?
---
What the hell is a beater?
---
In Vanilla, not really. The time investment needed to keep up was absurd. In Classic guilds could take their time, nothing would prevent them from doing progress without raiding literally every ID.
---
shaman and pallys are always in high demand. druids are hit and miss alot of times there are not enough of em in a raid goup yet sometimes ppl won't take new ones. rogues are solid. priests are solid; warriors are solid. mages can be a bit over saturated also hunters. Locks can be over saturated at start, but generally guilds would take more aq onwards.
---
Yes sir, veteran AB flag defender here.
---
Preferably using Brokentooth, stealth him on one side of the flag somewhat far away, you go to the other side. If you get sapped, wait till he’s spinning flag and send pet in. Important also to be at max range, so they have to run all the way to the flag, minimizing the effective sap duration.
---
I afk at the Org bank modless, like a pro.
---
I love my 5 button Zowie too much to switch just for WoW. There's plenty of keybind real estate on the keyboard if you utilize Ctrl, Shift and Alt modifiers on everything.
---
Funny enough this is pretty much the post I was hoping for. Grateful to everyone else in the thread for the responses but I'm glad to head this POV.
---
Like I said I'm very aligned with the 'roll what you want' crew but my fear is spending all my short valuable time and not having fun due to time limits, I love the levelling in WOW but for me the most fun is the pvp at 60.
---
I think you're right about things getting overblown, people complain that the min/maxer rush to BIS rhetoric has gone too far(youll only be taken seriously as a dwarf priest? Come the fuck on) and I think maybe that's bled into the game as a whole rather than just the gear.
---
It's me your Bulgarian brother.
---
Mistake to retcon it or mistake to make this questline?
---
SoO was indeed pretty good, but I think it lasting so long soured peoples' opinion of it.
---
Don't forget this:
---
http://gordogato.com/oscommerce/catalog/images/zm_dell_logitech_ps2_mouse_1.jpg
---
I don't remember that, but I remember campfires used to be physical objects which people could walk/jump onto.
---
Some had the idea to build a bridge of campfires across the ocean and bypass the fatigue water. So Blizzard decided to make campfires non-physical.
---
1. Chat antispam delay - no more ASCIIart
---
2. Quest links
---
3. Realm selection wizard - the "Suggest Realm" window
---
4. Disconnected message (this matters, seriously)
---
5. No loading screen when hearthing to the same map
---
6. Instance Selection for battlegrounds ("Alterac Valley 2")
---
7. Deserter debuff (it was added in some patch, wasn't it?)
---
8. Light's Höpe Chapel and Silithus - even if there are no NPCs or quests, there could be 1.12 terrain.
---
9. Rotation animations, for both NPCs and players
---
10. Failed attempt
---
PS. @AutöMöderatör thank yöu för införming me aböut that private server.
---
I do feel your compassion for the least fortunate.
---
However, you are clearly uninformed, and most likely will be a financial victim of a "poor boy" from Bulgaria who earns "$60 a month".
---
Bulgarian minimum wage is 260 euro/month (aprox. $300). Median wage is around 500-600 euros a month. I am sorry, but there is no way in hell someone could work for $60 / month in Bulgaria.
---
Looks like Nigerian prince scam is, for WoW, "poor Bulgarian boy".
---
Don't throw away your money.
---
&gt; Rune of the Guard Captain
---
Confirmed.  No Alliance equivalent.
---
Yeah, its good... The real problem is the time you spend in the zone hearing the same music.. It's like OG, I can't stand it anymore.. hehehe
---
...I'm well aware of that. Even in vanilla, spirit health regen was high enough that taking 10 fire damage every 2-3 seconds would not kill you.
---
Oh, I totally just want everyone to come together and have a good time.
---
But sometimes it's still fun to rip on each other. :)
---
Resto Druid (played since Vanilla) - LF a semi hardcore to hardcore raiding guild. 
---
25 no wife and no kids willing to fully dedicate time to WoW.
---
Region: EU
---
Server Type: PVP
---
Raids: Looking for either a WEEKEND raiding or MIDNIGHT raiding guild. I work evening shifts :(
---
I mean tank druids are already considered to be 'fine'. Warriors are still overall better, but Skarm has done alot to de-stigmatize feral tanks.
---
As for DPS specs.. Meh no it's really not going to change. There might be a bit of a shakeup just because they are launching the game with 16 debuff slots instead of 8, but for the most part nothing is going to change. 
---
By shakeup it means the raid might bring 1 shadow-priest. Maybe 1 feral druid can have a bleed spot. For the most part people have solved the game as far as what does the most damage.
---
Lack of healers does kind of make it a seller's market I suppose lol. PvP spec healer is better than none in the end.
---
It's not about "real estate", it's about not having to take your hand off of the movement keys, or take your hand off of your mouse.
---
This exchange made me giggle
---
The axe specialization racial doesnt really do anything for pvp. Orc is still a good choice for pvp though.
---
Also, to my knowledge, sword spec is generally better than axe spec
---
Every role has a prebis item from that chain, I believe
---
Onslaught girdle and strikers mark beg to differ
---
I literally top the HPS and overall healing done with the least amount of overheal on every raid as a resto druid. This is in a private server hardcore guild with everyone in T2 and T2.5 gear. Anyone telling you that druids aren't beasts at healing is just wrong. Learn how to play it properly and be #1 in all your raids
---
I'm sure its doable for pugs and farm content but not for progression
---
Unfortunately, your comment has been removed because private servers blah blah.
---
Herb/mining and skinning while leveling and use it for farm until you start an alt and repeat, this way you will have lots of gold and stock it on banks and use it to level proffs and sell on AH to make you rich.
---
Thinking about 3 chars (lock, mage, rogue) doing the same on all. If I'm able to play the first 2 phases I think I will use that time leveling my chars making me economically stable. Also doing the lock first because feel it will give me a huge head start gold wise.
---
I'm fairly certain I'll be a gnome warlock as my main.
---
I might dabble into warrior or rogue as an alt eventually... as a gnome.
---
Engineering +15 for the win if you're going to do both Gnomish and Goblin items.
---
On planning to home Back to g502 plenty of customisation there.
---
0 kg
---
I welcome all walks of life to the world of Azeroth.
---
Except for gnomes.
---
Going to an inn to see at night
---
I'd just add that at the top of the skill level, warriors are beaten by rogues too.
---
played a priest on private servers. your BiS tank while leveling, but come late game dungeons BRD, Scholo, Strat you will start to fall off a bit. ergo can be hard to heal, but it is very doable: it's just not the path of least resistance. Can tank raids when ppl are overgeared since alot of times ferals generate more threat than warrs, but you oom your healers faster. So you can clear easy raids faster. Just keep in mind you will be offtank at best in progression raids.
---
I applaud your enthusiasm!
---
Yes, but you become immune to that insult after level 40 or so
---
Thank you :)
---
I still wonder if they remember to make the green dragons shadow damage instakill impossible to reflect with the engineering trinket. 
---
Also there are if I remember correctly some demon mobs that turn invincible after taking too much damage that can be WL mindcontrolled and then brought to a city.
---
And recbombing worldbosses as a paladin.
---
lol Sword Art
---
Yup. This confused the shit out of me because I vividly remember him having the blood elf model. Then when I saw him on the P server, I stared at him for a good while in thought.
---
Improved WF totem?
---
Horde &gt; Alliance quest chain
---
The retail is completely different now. All zones have changed after cata and mobs/quests scale to your level.
---
If you want to give yourself a refresher before classic, you'd be better of jumping on one of the private servers.
---
probably a cash shop item?
---
For me it's Vanilla &gt; BC &gt; Wrath &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; MoP... The rest are all pretty bad. 
---
I feel like Legion was only considered good because of how bad WoD was and now how bad BFA is. If legion came out right after WoTLK or BC people would have hated it because of how terrible the itemization was and how simplified all of the classes are.
---
How much you wanna beat I can throw this gnome over Mount Hyjal?
---
I've never had an issue with moving while using a keybind w/ modifiers
---
This is a good mindset.
---
Am I alone here in thinking this video is stupid and a waste of time?
---
Nah, they have been taking away stuff for the last few expansions. Especially now in BfA classes are extremely gutted. 
---
&gt;Everyone has stuns, everyone has dots, everyone has a little selfheal, everyone has a sprint
---
As a frost mage, nope. I can get gear that heals me a bit, but that's about it. 
---
I'm not a PvPer, but in general what they have done compared to vanilla is taken away all the minor abilities classes had, and consolidated it all into fewer but more significant abilities. Each class still has a bit more tools than they did in vanilla, but it's no longer the case that "everyone has everything", like I think it was a few expansions back. 
---
There are at least many other much bigger differences between vanilla and retail PvP, the huge health pools is the first thing I thought of.
---
According to his post history he's 15 years old and a student, so might only work part time, since it's strictly regulated at that age.
---
But since he's able to buy "expensive" rapper merch, I personally wouldn't support him - but I guess it's a matter of personal opinion.
---
lol I hated this one.
---
I will not go into much detail for each spec other than saying Ideal, viable, not viable for Hardcore to Semi-Hardcore Raiding. Viable is defined as is acceptable dps/tanking ability/heals. Please be aware a lot of these do just fine in casual guilds, or in other aspects of the game like PvP. I am Only covering raiding as you asked.
---
**Warrior:**
---
* Arms: Not Viable/Viable Really depends on the 2 hander being used, but even with the best 2 hander Arms is less dps on average than Fury
---
* Fury: Ideal
---
* Deep Prot: Ideal
---
* Fury/Prot: Viable
---
**Paladin:**
---
* Holy: Ideal
---
* Prot: Not Viable, outside of a few fights throughout the raids
---
* Ret:  Not Viable
---
**Hunter:**
---
* BM: Not Viable
---
* MS/Surv: Ideal
---
* MS/BM: Ideal
---
**Shaman:**
---
* Ele: Not Viable
---
* Enhance: Not Viable
---
* Resto: Ideal
---
* Ele/Resto 30/0/20 +1: Viable
---
**Druid:**
---
* Boomkin: Not Viable
---
* Feral: Ideal as both Feral dps, or Feral tank
---
* Moonglow/Resto: Ideal
---
* HotW: Viable
---
**Rogue:**
---
* Combat swords: Ideal
---
* Combat daggers: Viable
---
* I know there are other specs but I don’t know rogue too well to know if other specs are or are not viable
---
**Priest:**
---
* Dsic: Not Viable
---
* Holy 21/30/0: Ideal
---
* Shadow:  Viable
---
* Disc/Shadow: Not Viable
---
**Mage:**
---
* Deep Fire: Ideal for AQ+
---
* Deep Frost: Ideal before AQ, normally 1 per raid for Winters Chill
---
* Arcane/Frost:  Ideal before AQ
---
* Arcane/Fire: Ideal for AQ+
---
**Warlock:**
---
* SM/Ruin: Ideal, very slightly worse dps than DS/Ruin, but is a better PvP spec, and also is better on fights with lots of movement. Aka the better spec imo
---
* DS/Ruin: Ideal
---
* Destro: I am unsure, but I think not viable
---
Every boss till naxx can be done with 5 of every class in your raid. 
---
Only 4horsemen, third to last boss in the game, requires class stacking (8 prot warriors).
---
Who's worried. It was just a shower thought.
---
I see a lot of people saying Ret Paladin damage was bad in vanilla, and that if you want to play paladin, you need to be a healer.
---
What about shaman? Could they do respectable DPS? I've seen crazy windfury sulfuras 2h videos, but what about the average shaman?
---
Right? Come on Saurfang Jr.
---
No. Not even the part with Scarlet Monastery. Maybe the instance is good, but not the entrance area. I hated it. Always hard to find the door, the main gate appears closed.
---
About the zone, there is nothing good. As a Druid, I will never agree to the undeath and corruption. And, there is no single natural place with non-broken ecology - maybe that fairy ring.
---
The city located there is also BS to navigate, even for a horde. Even finding the flightmaster is tough, boring and irritating.
---
On your 1-6 keys, sure, but what about everything else?
---
i knew bulgarians playing in 2008.  if they could pay for it then, they can pay for it now. bulgaria is not as poor as it sounds
---
Damn, im getting real good at downvoting threads like these by only reading the title.
---
Balance is impossible, only meta change. So what now? Do you call retail balanced? You either change that meta every few patches or you don't touch shit and leave classic, classic. If you make you happy, someone else will cry for the same reason. I hope you people will someday realize that there is no such thing as balance.
---
For rogues in raids, I'm assuming the 16 debuff limit meant that rupture was a no go? Does that mean the rotation was keep SnD up and eviscerate when you had the window?
---
I totally agree
---
As I recall, one of the ONLY zones NOT effected from cataclysm is Dun Morogh. And even then, new quests have been added. And even then, the leveling experience is so radically different, that is, you level so much faster, it's kinda pointless.
---
That said, there are numerous vanilla leveling guides online so check those out. Beware though that some are based on private server data so it might not be 100% accurate.
---
thats just because a mage is extremely good at farming. warrior is still more than serviceable enough to support itself without requiring another character or an unhealthy play schedule
---
Have they said if new models will be in classic?
---
Wouldn’t even know where to start with the private servers? 🙄
---
Except for the part where that cant be true because the dungeon finder was added with ICC, not TOC.
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_3.3.0
---
Out of curiosity because I'm strongly considering playing druid what exactly does your encounter healing look like? I know you use lower ranked healing touches but what about regrowth/rejuv?
---
&gt; I'm not a PvPer, but in general what they have done compared to vanilla is taken away all the minor abilities classes had, and consolidated it all into fewer but more significant abilities.
---
That is exactly what people hate. It were these abilities that gave classes an identity.
---
On everything lol. Have you ever seen a good vanilla player's keyboard? Nearly every single keyboard button and modifier is used. They obviously aren't clicking them, it's not at all hard hitting these buttons with decent finger dexterity. 
---
I'm not denying the MMO mice are nice. I'm just saying it's a nice to have not a must have.
---
Its more like, people considering between druid and some other classes may move towards the others from being told that druids are bad.
---
Is it not in the logs?
---
Warriors were subjected to the hybrid tax before their rework in 1.6.  Warriors could not dps and they were bad.  Once they got their rework they took out the hybrid tax.
---
Get that Luffa from Searing Gorge, baby. On-use Trinket that removes a bleed once every 2 (maybe 3?) minutes. Not sure if they will have the 2.1 (?) nerfs still baked into the vanilla version (doesn't work on bleeds cast by mobs over level 60), but it will still work in PVP. Niche, but quite nice on my warrior and rogue back in the day, and worked against Corehound bleeds as well.
---
Priest can offensive dispel, yes. However having blessing of freedom for a warrior(or flag carrier) is ridiculousness. The utility that alone brings is pretty OP.
---
For tanking having a high health pool is more important than armor from a healers perspective.
---
Sure numbers dropped a little after the initial launch just like every expansion after wrath, but MoP held a steady 7 mill subs for the majority of the expansion. Took me 2 min to find the numbers on google, do some research before you just assume stuff.
---
I know it’s cloth but it has better stats 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Very true, so many of the animations have this bouncy/stretchy thing going on that peeks down the uncanny valley.
---
If you don't know what I mean, go on BFA and turn on the old models, and play a 2h class. Then go hit stuff. You'll see the model warp in the most unnatural ways, stretching out and bending erratically. You can sometimes see patches of bright white on the character where light is reflecting off a single giant, stretched polygon as the character does a whirlwind animation or something.
---
&gt; I honestly can't remember how I managed to play for so long without a 12-button mouse. 
---
I can. The same way as today. Using the back/forward, ctrl-back/ctrl-forward, sihft-ctrl-alt/shift-ctrl-forward bindings. Never liked the keyboard keybinds.
---
I'm waiting for the delivery of an MMO mouse.
---
&gt; Logitech makes MMO Mice as well 
---
G600 - but it's not being sold anymore
---
FBI OPEN UP
---
If it's some cheapo china knock off you're probably fucked. The Logitech lets you bind the buttons to be almost anything you want.
---
Ah ok, will take a look.
---
I still have my original wow manual with many quests and leveling info. 
---
Will check out some of the online guides.
---
Made me a much better WoW player.
---
Razer Naga/Logitech G600 are the way to go. Not restricted to MMO's, you've got an advantage in literally any game you play.
---
Hi, /u/mikeclav
---
Warlocks were super gimpy when the game released. The talent trees weren't even finished until 1.8/1.9. Will of the forsaken lasted 20 seconds, which was longer than the whole fight some times.
---
1.12 warlocks are in a much better place.
---
I have stuff like ctrl D, F. S and same for alt. Even ctrl space bar
---
not only shame for you, but also for your family, and your customers (for an ice cream seller)
---
To make the quest line. They basically said stonetalon garrosh is non cannon.
---
I never said MMO mice are a "must have". They just make things insanely easier, no having to awkwardly stretch your thumbs out or "jump and autorun".
---
We have to give the Tirisfal Glades soundtrack some credit aswell. The slow piano and just the overall mood off of it gets me everytime. It captures the history of the zone, it’s very dark and sad and it reminds you that this place once was filled with life. Now it is just filled with darkness and death.
---
My 31 goes into Enha
---
Warriors probably benefit more from pallys though.
---
I’m planning to just roll fresh when it drops, not played since tbc. Playing horde instead of alliance so I’m going in even more blind. Sticking with my original class though because nostalgia and shadow priest was fun
---
Its funny, legion is part of the reason the game sucks now, but legion itself was so much damn fun.
---
You need hammer but there’s no quest for it just get the two parts from the elites innhinterlands but good luck getting it before lvl 45-46.
---

---
I think having that kind of flexibility is super sick for pvp.  As for raiding, vanilla seems easy enough that people won't need to minmax, eh?
---
I dont dont find it funny now and I highly doubt I wouldve found it funny back when I was 15.
---
Are you talking the 3x exp for RaF?
---
Because if so, no.
---
I have [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Redragon-Programmable-Precision-Buttons-Windows/dp/B00GU8W5AE/) which is apparently programmable. I'll have to mess with it some time to see if I can just macro some weird key combination to fake having extra buttons.
---
Thank you for the response, when I'm no longer driving I'll reply back with a more engaging follow-up. With everything you just stated in terms of getting a raid slot, I now have to consider the difficulty of getting geared via raids. At the end of the day I want to play a class that has strong 1vX capability.
---
&gt;A two man "group" running solo except for group/Target kill quests will hit 60 roughly a ~day sooner than a duo who grouped the whole time.
---
I can believe that. But it's mostly a logistical thing, not mathematical. If you could actually coordinate enough that you were not standing around waiting for each other and stuff like that I'm pretty sure it would be at least equal or maybe faster to go in a group. But in reality that amount of coordination while levelling is not realistic. 
---
Loot quests are obviously a lot slower as a group, especially with limited spawns. But it also depend on how you look at it, if you are just grouping up with random players it won't make a difference, as they would be there competing with you anyway. It's only when you deliberately level in a group for longer periods of time that you get held back while waiting for respawns and stuff like that. 
---
If you are solo levelling and get invited by other players doing the same quest it's pretty much never slower to be in the group, no matter the quest type, assuming you are equally good at tagging mobs and stuff like that. Since you are comparing killing stuff for shared xp vs killing less stuff. At least I don't think so, or how bad are the group penalties in actual vanilla? Do you get less than half xp from being two players? Or less than a third from being three players?
---
&gt; One thing I guess I didn't realize is that the side buttons aren't unique; they essentially duplicate the number keys on the keyboard, so you can't bind them to separate things.
---
Why exactly is that a problem? The entire point of having these buttons on the side of your mouse is so that you don't have to use the number keys on your keyboard.
---
With alt + shift + ctrl modifiers that gives you up to 48 different keybinds you can use with the mouse buttons. There's no way you possibly need more than 48 things keybound.
---
im just speaking from my own personal experience of playing warrior/rogue on multiple servers in the past years. i have always ended up with a nice cushion of materials and gold without any absurd time investment. all it takes is a bit of planning ahead, making friends, and knowing what is worth spending money on to stretch your dollars a little further than usual.
---
Hi, /u/twtchtv_LottoOne
---
ALLLLLLLL ambiance
---
I use a corsair mouse that has 12 buttons on the thumb, adjustable position. It's really good with wow gameplay.
---
Is that the hit and ap trinket?
---
The reward is that you get to play with a friend
---
google? :)  since they are illegal to play on i'm not gonna post any links here...but its not hard to find :)
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/ZuhfuJF.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/ZuhfuJF.jpg) 
---
That's the truth. At least was on vanilla back then - a very rare class, feeling "elite".
---
Back when I played Vanilla, a priest in my MC raid got upset because I was healing other people outside of my group whenever my party was full on health. I had a lot of overhealing but plenty of mana. I always out healed any of the other healers. Not sure where the beef is coming from but they're definitely great healers
---
&gt;A feral druid can be both dps and tank by just switching gear thats why raids bring 1.
---
and a healer
---
Lol nice counter.
---
It would be cool if they added a reward for getting inactive players to return, a while after release of course. To help push those undecided return home (whoever they are?)
---
And then $20/month
---
You know what used to happen to these people in classic wow? They get called out in general chat, then someone (or 5) better than them come kill them and spawn camp them at the graveyard.  
---
Let them try killing lowbies, it's their own game and their own pride that will be shattered very soon after
---
As some would say #nochanges. This wasn't in vanilla.
---
age of consent is 14-16 in europe, FBI has no claim, haha
---
&gt; So, how good are druids?
---
They are arguably the best best class for flag carrying, so there is that. But then again hunters, mages and paladins also does very well on that part.  
---
  If you like druid pvp and flag carrying then check out [Stormling/Stormx](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo4Fn7tCjnFSBATOE0lEekA)
---
I played vanilla but haven't played WoW in 15 years. I don't remember jack about the game mechanics. I'm pretty sure I'll be right alongside you as a noob.
---
From what I remember, the mechanics are pretty simple anyway, at least for PvE. The main challenges are teamwork and social stuff. It's not like an FPS game where there is a huge learning curve and veterans will dominate a new player.
---
Then Mage or Rogue are kinda good bets imo.
---
But no matter the class, 1vX allways comes down to outgearing, and having more tools. 
---
So Engi, and world items , pots will help alot, and can give every class its moments.
---
Mages and Rogues just have them more often, if you can play them, both classes have alot of tools but on the flip side are very squshi, if you make one mistake you can die even against a "bad" player.
---
Why are you calling me out like this, your don't even know me. How rude!
---
In all seriousness, I can't wait, and this is my life now.
---
Can I recommend you [MadSeasonShow](https://www.youtube.com/user/madseasonshow/videos)? :)
---
Especially the [Time Warp series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5Tl-BUN23g&amp;list=PL0hAOfdoZQkIogz4SIw20uY4f6wJhgSKZ) and [My Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0anqyc7greQ&amp;list=PL0hAOfdoZQkKwtaqopOagKmO3HL75rdpB) for the nostalgia.
---
The offensive potential is also defensive though, if a Warrior is on you with Freedom or FAP you can just dispel it, meaning he can be cc'd by your casters, PI is also completely op on Ele Sham and Mage, you can even go tri spec in a triple Priest comp for the Silence, Blackout stun and trash buff stacking in Shadow Weaving. I say its the strongest class for premade because it enables your teammates offensively and defensively, even though Disc Priest is bad outside of group PvP you can just go Shadow and faceroll in solo PvP (:
---
10 man 3d was challenging for you? There were legit a melee and a caster composition that could nuke Sarth before any mechanics came into play. That was a JOKE.
---
About as illegal as people going 36 mph in a 35 mph zone.
---
There is no Scarab Lord title in vanilla/classic. Just the mount.
---
No in game rewards, except maybe ONE cosmetic item. Could give a month of free game time or something
---
All is fair in a world at war.  I resolved to never let it get to me.  If I see a hostile, I will kill them, and keep killing them, whether they are the same level or lower.  If they are above me, I will avoid them, but if I get ganked and camped, I welcome it.  If I can revel in the misery of someone else, then it is only fair that they get to do the same.  The solution to getting ganked?!  Log off and play an alt/do something else for a bit.  They will probably get on their merry way as well.
---
What logs?
---
I'm probably very wrong on these but it's what I remember. 
---
Mage counters warrior/rogue
---
My feral druid countered rogues because of fearie fire
---
Warlock usually killed my druid
---
Hunter, good against melee harder time with range unless they just nuke you. 
---
Theres a lot of skill required tho for each class some more than others like warriors or druids.
---
Chen and thereby pandaren were canon since TFT.
---
I was originally alliance then rerolled horde. Seemed less drama on horde. Main was a hunter, but thinking of shammy this time.
---
I believe it you got some amount of game time when you referred someone.  Don't remember how much it was. Some type of incentive that didn't affect any gameplay.
---
Changing the leveling speed invalidates everyone else's progress thats already been made.  Not worth the risk IMO.  I agree with you.
---
grinding for fire resist potions and consumables most of the time instead tbh
---
"BUT BUT dude what you say is impossible and anyway nowadays no one would be dumb enough to take you in raid. Bring your weight in DPS or fuck off!"
---
Well like most raiding, if you understand the mechanics and have a half way decent understanding of your class you can clear most content. The issue you'll find is that a lot of people who played Vanilla private servers are looking to play optimally and druids aren't optimal.
---
That said, the community at large won't care what you play because they just want bodies to fill a 40 man.
---
There isn't anything wrong with picking druid if that is what you want to play. I plan on playing one whether I main it or as my alt. I just wouldn't expect to be part of any of the first guilds on your server clearing progression.
---
My main was a hunter, and I never had an issue with gold.
---
I think mage aoe farming takes more skill to learn how to do it well, where as hunter is easier due to pet / FD etc.
---
If u really wanted to play classic that badly just play a private server. Satisfies my urge just fine :)
---
I have no reason to not believe what you are saying but keep in mind, just because it so happens, IN YOUR GUILD, that you are the best healer, this, by itself, doesn't tell the OP much about Druids across the board. And a lot depends on WHY you are the best healer in your raid:
---
How many other Druids are running it? How many of them are healers? Are they behind you in gearing? Better? The same? How many other healer classes do you have? Are you running 25 man's or 40s? Are you horde or alliance? Could it be you are simply better then the other healers? What types of addons are you running?
---
Just these variables make a massive difference and yet none if it will prove definitely that Druids are competitive. You would need a much larger and more comprehensive sample size then this. 
---
All I can say is that Druids do deserve the "Jack of all trades" tag since they can (technically) do everything. And blizzard has worked very hard to balance all the classes both in pve and PvP.
---
Plot twist: He names his character Scarablord.
---
No. Your reward for bringing friends to Classic is having friends to play classic with. Their reward is being able to play the game.
---
Greater than as in more time consuming, yes. True. Correct. Grats.
---
In phase one hunter can farm Mara which is nice because of no competition.  Mage can do some serious air farming though.   Once phase 2 comes if dm farming still works mage will pull ahead
---
Remember, you’re only a tourist once you leave, you can always convince them to stay :)
---
Tell that to the *Nostralius* staff. Never the less its still easy to find one to play around on untill the real deal launches
---
I mean, kind of tough considering hunters have 41 yards range, a pet to tag you and a freezing trap waiting for someone to overeagerly charge into it. The matchup is easier if you get the jump, but it's still super hunter favoured
---
The original video was taken down by Youtube years ago for copyright violation. All the ones that are up are copies.
---
No, nothing like this, ever.
---
It works best when you have friends doing it with you so you can stack multiple fires on 1 person
---
I didn't claim anything regards to that, so your remark is a bit out of place.
---
There are potions for that!
---
&gt; It were these abilities that gave classes an identity.
---
I disagree. What gave classes their identity was their big, unique, and easily identifiable abilities. Like warlocks had fear, mages had sheep/blizzard/blink, rogues had stealth/stuns, warriors had huge ass weapons (lol) and charge, hunters had pets/kiting, etc. 
---
Amplify/dampen magic or frost/fire ward is not what gave vanilla mages their identity, but that is the sort of thing that has been removed in retail. It definitely did add flavor and could be used for interesting micro-management in PvP, but that's not really what we are talking about. 
---
The issue I would agree on is that giving too many classes similar abilities makes the game less interesting (and lessens the individual identity of classes, obviously). But I also don't think that actually is a huge issue in retail any more, at least not on the PvP side (which suffers from this as well as PvP).
---
I really hope this stigma does not follow us into classic. Warriors are commonly used for Main tanks in raids, but outside of that, druids, pallys, and even on some occasion shamans can tank, and often times are more than capable. The elitist of the elite will always spew the "only warriors can tank", despite so many videos on YouTube showing otherwise.
---
Correct. 1% hit and 20 AP, IIRC. Pretty insane considering how hard trinkets were to come by.
---
Because I'd rather have additional buttons that don't conflict with the number keys. And I'd prefer to have more keybinds that don't require ctrl+ or alt+ as having to press 2 buttons to execute an action is slightly more awkward.
---
Mages are an insanely good class. 
---
They have top DPS potential at all raid tiers.
---
They have a cornucopia of survival and escape spells for PvP.
---
Their CC is the most desired in 5m dungeons. (even if it's not -really- the best).
---
They can farm gold almost as well as hunters right off the bat. Once ZG comes out they will be the undisputed kings or gold farming.
---
They will get raid spots easily because most raids take eight of them.
---
All three talent trees are good for something.
---
They really don't have any downsides.
---
Sure. Be familiar with your roster, look at your roster when you get online, see who is missing.
---
Lowbies aren't unarmed combatants.  What you are saying is like getting mad that a guy in an f-15 shot down a guy in a P-38.  They were both equipped for war, just one is in a shittier tier plane than the other.
---
Man, this reminds me of another crazy private server pvp video.
---
It was this Night Elf Rogue, running around in dark red leather armour (I forget where that comes from--T5?) just jumping around for like 12 damn minutes. And three songs played on it. He was just mindlessly showing off in Dun Morogh movespeed, items, whatnot. Silly as hell.
---
But I really liked one of those songs so I kept watching that video over and over again lol. I could never find it since.
---
MoP was about horde vs aliance at max lvl,a thing which was mostly just in vanilla really, with a bit of it thrown in in wotlk, just a tiny bit tho, the rest, tbc, most of wotlk, cata were about saving the world, which is lame that the game is always and constantly about saving the world
---
Kill Hogger
---
warlock depends on the pet youre using though
---
Does he have any vids where he actually fights decent players?
---
The lame part is the Kung fu panda theme.
---
Which is weird since I reckon the Venn diagram of MMO players and anime fans is about as close to a circle as it gets. (Full disclosure: I am both)
---
Mostly about dead zone management and learning the strengths/weaknesses of other classes.
---
For example I remember noob hunters would serpent sting me(warrior) for some extra damage and then lay a freezing trap down. 
---
It’ll come with practice though.
---
Pet management. Trap usage. Maintaining your range. Picking your spots. Setting up macros. Knowing what other classes are capable of. Swapping Aspects. If you master all of those you will be a force to be reckoned with.
---
This isn't even a marginally OK effort. The video is cringe.
---
Why would you post this, OP?
---
I want my seconds back.
---
I loved Desolace. All my toons went through there. It was a haven if you are tired of STV ganking. Plus it gives a ton of quests for mara. Downside is the amount of traveling in that zone, the upside is it's fairly flat with very little obstacles.
---
Just read the first sentence of my post pls
---
Then GMs step in and suspend you for harasment/griefing
---
Until their large group of followers ganks and harasses you mercilessly.
---
every class has one class that crushes them in 1v1
---
🤷🏽‍♂️
---
You are not gonna MS crit for 2k+ without r14 weaps and epic pvp gear. Remember doing 600 MS crit with spinal reaper and r10 gear against bear druid. stop talking about things you don't know
---
Not all heroes show capes
---
Side question - I read that some key abilities are different in Classic.  Sap takes you out of stealth, WTF! 
---
So be it, but I realized Cloak of Shadhows doesnt exist in Classic.  How do rogues remove dots and vanish?
---
Elementals are also immune to bleeds iirc so double no go.  You'll rarely be able to sneak a rupture in somewhere like Twinemps where a spell immune target means a lot of free debuff slots but generally speaking you're right, no rupture.  tldr without adrenaline rush up 1pt SnD &gt; 3pt evis &gt; repeat unless you have tea or AR up.
---
Ah, I didn't mean that was always the case. Just wondering what to do in that specific situation.
---
Those all sound incredibly fun. Thanks so much for the answer!
---
This is the problem.  For every hateful dude looking to gank him non stop, he'll have 100 fanbois hanging from his nuts to give him free shit, power levels, and protect him while he does his thing.
---
I honestly don't care if they change vanilla. They could add artifact knowledge, and legendaries that drop through world maps, but that's beside the pint if the joke.
---
I gotcha. I'm sure a lot of it comes down to experience. Thanks for your answer!
---
You remember that female tauren had their eyes permanently closed in their unitframe, right? That stuff annoyed me to no end.
---
It's a china theme. With your logic we could say WoD is a JoJo theme because the main characters were muscular dudes.
---
Fun for booming in pvp, rarely will parse well as elemental in bwl if chromaggus has a bunch of nature vulnerabilities, otherwise isn't ideal or much damage.  Ele &gt; enh, though enh is probably equal value if you have a thunderfury in the raid.
---
15$ a month is so much money saved if you think of all the other stuff you would be doing to fill that void
---
Thanks! I like soyen and oto's guides posted on the Nost forums, but always welcome new info.
---
It's from an anime, Sword Art Online. It's meant to be a mix between "beta tester" and "cheater", because of information advantages that the beta testers had over other players. Not that it actually makes sense in this context, as all information you could possibly want is already out there.
---
play what you like man, even druids! mostly you will never meet with all the people bagging on druids here
---
Yeah : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtMsTlNowQ0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtMsTlNowQ0) but he lost almost every duel.
---
Holy fuck I hate the MoP circlejerk, like all expansions/patches post 3.3 it sucked ass
---
Any reason why streamers ruin games?  If anything I would think they are good because they bring more people into the game.  I would think the more the merrier
---
class stacking makes fights boring. If they can be killed without it--it isnt an achievement to do it stacked.
---
That said, Sarth 10m 3d was far and away the hardest fight of the first tier. However, the only tier easier than first wrath tier was vanilla wows MC and Ony. 
---
Also at the time I played with \~17 potatoes. Even when we did the 10m after our terrible 25m raid we still carried 2 potatoes with us. We didnt have a depth chart to stack even if we wanted to.
---
Fucking lol WoW2 began with patch 3.3 dude
---
Improved WF is \~4 DPS.
---
What about steamers ruin a game for you?
---
Does the mount not qualify as a hard to get item to you?
---
&gt; Bonebiter also for pallys/**shamans**. 
---
Bonebiter is only for the Alliance-side quest. Horde version of the quest only has a 1h sword for a weapon reward.
---
What in the fuck at all of those? COCAINE!
---
Aren't you just helping their stream by making exciting content?
---
The counter circlejerk about it on Reddit is way too strong though
---
Warrior beats Druid?  Maybe if the fight is indoors in a small hut and there are no pillars or exits. Lol
---
Druids are my favorite class in Vanilla. They are beasts in PvE and PvP. They also have the largest variety of specs by a fair margin. They have their quirks for each role like not having an OOC rez as a healer, immune to polymorph in animal forms, lazerchicken being essentially useless but when played correctly a druid is a very valuable asset and a blast to play
---
It’s more like a swarm of paparazzi following a celebrity into a nice quiet restaurant where everyone wants to just relax and enjoy their meal
---
Yeah this is another thing that differentiates skill from noob. Don’t run around in Cheetah the entire time getting dazed all over the place. Use it to get to where you need and swap to Hawk.
---
It depends what kind of PvP. For vanilla the deadzone was tough, but totally manageable. 
---
Hunters has to learn to wing clip, jump shot (art of running and jumping, doing a swivel shooting and then Landing still running away, Learn to drop traps all the time, keep your stings up etc!  
---
Hunters were great in AV and Arathi Basin as they could guard flags well. Track hidden, sitting on traps, and having your pet close to the flag also helped you against rogues sapping and flag capping. 
---
I got to rank 12 as a hunter. Only thing stopped me getting higher was time.
---
Then we will do battle on the plains of Azeroth.
---
as long as i get the old animations back then i couldnt care less
---
Even with hamstring?
---
what about wallwalking into Hyjal
---
As someone who enjoys using the AH to produce most of my gold, I will tell you that niche market is not difficult if you have 2 things. Endless time and unlimited money. You have to always be ready to either buyout other auctions or undercut others. If they undercut again and again your profits are just lost. And buying out other people is a tough one because if they're just a fraction under you and you repost you're going to lose your profit or take a loss from the AH fees. So picking high demand but low population goods is best, but you'd be surprised by how little you can actually make trying to strangle a large open market like primals were unless they are very careful.

Right. It sucks because all my countless Vanilla screenshots are still stuck on a dead hard drive I have laying around. Could link you tons of pics of big dick MS crits with my level  51 Ice barbed spear :).
---
A bear tank has the most base armor though, I'll give you that. Naturally crits against them will do much less damage.
---
I think being a skilled hunter is one of the most rewarding experiences. If you fight against a good hunter, it's extremely frustrating.
---
Its not that Im not striving for the loot either, I suppose its just its maybe 2-2.5 months away. we get news at a trickle, but we do know the phases, have access to patch notes from the day, and have multiple classic wow databases.
---
If my phone isnt ringing at work, Ive been monkeying around developing my own lists.
---
What do you mean small buttons??? They're pretty big already
---
I was always jealous of the Night Elf zones as Horde.  So damn amazing
---
AFAIK you can’t be punished for PVP
---
Love the time aspect of your answer! Thanks man! Why is warlock and mage different in regards to time investment? I am certain i can’t pull that kind of warrior, which might take that out of the equation. 
---
I’m a filthy casual. 
---
Love the warlock class fantasy, and played it back in 2005. 
---
Rogues are entriguing, since i’ll be able to get away from a sick fat kid ganking me 24/7.
---
I don’t have much love for mages, but they seem fun, at least same fun tier as rogue and warlock.
---
It's not about the quality of the content in this video
---
It's the fact that this video may be nostalgic for a ton of people around here...
---
I know this is classic wow, but the class order hall for druids in legion plays like a remixed version of that song and I really enjoyed it
---
Just throwing my binds out there since I use a mouse with only MB 4 and 5 on the side and feel like I still have enough binds.
---
I use Q, E, R, F, MB4, MB5, SHIFT+Q, SE, SR, SF, SMB4, SMB5, then 1 - 6, then Shift+1-6.
---
So that's 24 binds right there, plus I use Middle Mouse Button (Shift+MB3) for a few things as well. So 26 total without an MMO Mouse. 
---
I'm not opposed to MMO Mice at all, I've honestly never used one. Just wanted to point out there are tons of easy to reach binds on the keyboard.
---
It's not as bad as a Druid. You'll mostly heal using healing touch anyways.
---
You can get away by not using Swiftmend in a Raid. But Mana Tide Totem is just too usefull for the whole group.
---
I've done both sides, can't really remember them being different, lol
---
eh... I think the bigger impact is the positive effect the savings would have on your mental well being. I don't know how much you could get out of $360 over 2 years. That could fund a 2-3 day trip, 10-15 nice dinners out over those two years. Or, it could just barely buy you a brand new gaming console, but then you also have to continually spend $59 to get new games for it.
---
So it really depends. If you want to play Classic WoW, I'd say it's worth it, if not, then it's not.
---
No. You don't heal in a raid setting as a feral druid.
---
Battle on the plains of Azeroth but not to be confused for *Battle for Azeroth.*
---
I’m also rolling on a pvp server this time. Was on a pve before due to a friend who quit 1 month in 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Can’t wait to see how much I’m going to hate levelling this time 😭
---
I need to go into a coma for 3 months... At least I know what it's like to be immortal, because time is *literally not moving*.
---
How do streamers ruin games for you? I can see if they are causing a ruckus and bringing thousands of people into STV where they just erase everyone for 2 hours. 
---
But other than that I'm not seeing it. 
---
Maybe because im such a small streamer I really haven't witnessed the full power of it. The only things I've witnessed so far is getting stream sniped every once in a while which actually turns into some fun RPenis every now and again.
---
From googling quick it seems like G600 is still for sale, even directly from Logitech's Site. This is in the US at least. Also saw it on Amazon and Newegg.
---
I will never forget the magic of first time doing Grilly Hills quests while leveling. The music and story was so good. 
---
I want to be a noob again - and a teenager with no responsibilities.
---
That's a first

I don't think they will nerf it. It's all relevant. TBH I think DM solo farming is healthy as it puts more gold into the market which drives prices up of all trade goods. Plus there is a lockout limit on how often you can do it anyway. Unless you have multiple characters, you couldn't just sit there all day every day getting 10s of thousands of gold.
---
There are a lot of different ways in vanilla if you were dedicated to farm good gold per hour. DM was one of the better ones due to it being in an instance. You have 0 competition and no worry about being ganked to slow you down. Your profits come mostly off just vending junk.
---
With the amount of mages and priests at launch. Felcloth will most likely be a very very hot commodity to farm in the first few weeks. Every cloth character is going to want to gorge on the stuff. Not to mention it's needed for some of the biggest bags as well. IMO I am going ot live on felcloth farming (also demonic runes don't forget!) for some time.
---
What talent tree should I go down while leveling
---
Thank you for your many years of service.  You are an invaluable resource.  Cant wait to see you in classic
---
Yeah you can, he said he will be streamsniping to find a location of an enemy player without actually looking for him himself, which is against ToS I think.
---
Maybe a human, but the Superior Dwarven paladin should prevail.
---
Arena failed because blizzard wouldn't address balance. Resto druids with a lock or warrior were disgusting op for 18 months. Then came DKs... blizzard pvp balance was a joke compared to league  which came out in 09.
---
They are small.
---
Hi, /u/The_Lne
---
I forgot about this! Watching this makes my heart ache a little.
---
Tirisfal Glades is far easier than those damn quests at Sen'Jin Village.
---
&gt; Maybe druids can finally fulfill their dream of proper multi-roling.
---
What would need to happen is someone needs to create a "Useful Meter"             
---
Druid performed this much damage + healing + innervating which lead to X amount more healing/damage + Battle Rezzed X who went on to perform X amount of damage/healing + soaked/tanked this much damage.                
---
           
---
Shaman performed this much healing + Damage + How much damage increase totems provided + Mana restored + damage soaked with stone skin                 
---
          
---
Everyone talks about how stupid current Retail WoW players are because they need everything dumbed down to the point a toddler can understand it but those same shit talking dickheads look at damage meters and only care about who healed the very most or who did the very most damage.            
---
Interrupts, not standing in shit, watching your threat and supporting your fellow raiders is a billion times more useful but "Durrr bIG NumBEr MeAN I WOn!"
---
If it can be proven
---
That really only applies if you're MT and kind of sort of primary OT. As long as you can make raids and have ok OT gear in your bags you should be fine. The nice thing here is you will be able to potentially get more weapons to have fun with in PvP or, if you're lucky enough to be in a guild that can do AQ 40, get bad ass dps plate for PvP
---
I understand that Classic from all the games is the most time consuming one even to just reach 60. But honestly all classes can be fun and can do great regardless. Some are slightly more niche than others especially some specific specs, but overall millions of people played millions of characters and classes.
---
If you like the idea of the warrior, just roll that. They get huge damage spikes around level 30, 40 and 60. So it may be awhile until you feel properly overpowered.
---
In the patch that we're going to be playing come Classic, would hunters that tamed pets way below their level (for example, a level 60 hunter taming Broken Tooth or The Rake) immediately be granted a pet within three levels of their own? So a 60 taming a level 10 would get a level 57?  
---
Did you have to level them all the way up?
---
Does anyone else remember the trick in I think Duskwood where in a tomb if you turned the ambience all the way up and everything else down, you could hear Arthas I believe arguing with someone. 
---
I believe I got that right. Been so long
---
Feral can not be a dead weight to the raid group if you are dedicated and farm the appropriate gear.
---
Balance druids are crap in vanilla unfortunatelly and the party-wide 5% buff/innervate/battle ress is not enough to justify bringing one balance instead of another mage/warlock.
---
Wrong.
---
There are very few universes where pandas do Kung fu.
---
Lots of universes have muscly men.
---
It’s a shit theme that doesn’t fit in with the universe.
---
I played on Illidan-US so for me it's the login music lol. A lot of time waiting in queue
---
Saying snowflake and cuck unironically... kill yourself my man
---
locks are pretty shit as a fresh 60. They have  little mobility and rely on big health pools instead of a plethora of snares and mobility spells, which makes gear even more useful to a lock than a mage. They dont do as much as a mage in pve until end of bwl/aq (which will require a bit of dedication to get the gear from). Locks generally require more understanding of the game to play well. Mages are obvious in their toolset and can effectively be played against people in better gear.
---
Lmao. No, you won’t get banned for “streamsniping” (what a stupid fucking term btw).
---
Uhh yeah that’s about right
---
I played Horde until a couple months in, so the first time I walked into Stormwind I was like, THIS has been in the game all this time and I'm just discovering it?
---
So true man, growing up and reading all the early warcraft comics and books, all i ever wanted was to play a panda! All the great storylines, iconic characters, and memorable moments really stuck with me throughout the years and when MoP released I could finally at last play my favorite part of the Warcraft experience! Fucking pandas!
---
The music always reminds me of looking for prickly pear fruit
---
There was the April Fool’s joke that they based a few things on (Pandaria and Shado-pans get mentioned, but they changed the latter)
---
The best thing about druids, at least in 5 mans is that they really turn a bad situation around. If you pull adds and your healer gets instantly killed from behind you can quickly rez, take up healing or even off tank the adds. If the tank drops you can bear form and stay alive regardless of spec just by using a few cooldowns. I have no problem bring them along just for the ease of mind that they can bring.
---
Except daily quest grinds have been in previous expansions that had higher sub numbers.
---
fuck you all
---
Thank you for that quick answer :)
---
I don't think there's a way for that to really happen without changes.  I think the smallest actual change with the largest impact they could decide to make in regards to "offspec" viability would be removal of the 16 debuff limit.  That added flexibility alone would allow:
---
Rip
---
Rake
---
Judgement of the Crusader
---
Shadow Word: Pain
---
Serpent Sting
---
Moonfire
---
Corruption
---
Curse of Agony
---
Siphon Life
---
Curse of Doom
---
The problems that would cause though, Warlocks would rise above all other DPS (until they pull threat and die anyway), and basically every encounter in the game would become significantly easier due to a large increase in overall raid DPS that was previously limited/eliminated by the debuff limit existing.
---
Well as someone who loved Mop gameplay but hated the style I can say the style didn't match the seriousness of earlier expansions.
---
Can't recall saying banned, but it's against ToS so you can get punished:)
---
Im sitting here working, any opportunity to type about wow instead of analyzing spreadsheets ill take
---
I'm actually anti private server. I quit halfway thru tbc... Tried one and the community was trash. Filled with edgelords and people who think they know all about min maxing meanwhile I played at release. I'll be trashing on private server babies in the barrens and displaying hostility towards idiots openly in the barrens chat
---
🤣
---
Depends on the streamer. I sometimes watch his content/reactions, but fuck playing on Asmongold's server. Sodapoppin's cool, but I still want to avoid any massive hype machine for the wrong reasons.
---
I wouldn't mind playing on melderon/defcamp/Kargoz' server, though. They seem small enough to the point where I doubt there would be a tornado of desperation swirling around them at every moment. Plus, taking part in a genuinely wholesome community event might be cool.
---
I usually muted the music after level 20 or so.  Im not sure what any of the zones' music sounds like after 20
---
Yes. On the classic demo, with hamstring up, you could not make enough distance with a mob inbetween swings to get out of his melee range and prevent some hits.
---
I'm exact opposite, I love that battle music. Reminds me how badass Horde is.
---
I loved PvP with my Hunter in Vanilla. Just remember that in Vanilla it's less about class or even gear, it's all about your skill. If you know your player in and out then it'll be hard to take you down.
---
Since Cata the entire map is rather different, plus, leveling is damn fast now compared to how it was. Like XP values are radically altered etc and alot of the quest lines are different. The closest you could possibly get to trying out a leveling route would be on a pserver. But at this point, just wait, read a few guides and maybe hope for an open beta.
---
Grizzly Hills is the WoW. Not a single zone since then has come even close to this masterpiece.
---
Holy shit I miss Wotlk. I know many people here see Wotlk as the downfall of WoW, but for me personally it was peak of WoW.
---
I think 1 free month for the recruiter, and the friend. That way nobody is incentivized to spend money for flashy unobtainable bullshit cosmetics, and it just incentivizes playing the game with friends.
---
people totally will care about that

I re-rolled to a Troll Mage from my previous Gnome Warrior, changing servers and social groups completely. I joined my friends' raiding guild and, once hitting 60, went to raid MC with them. Thing was, I didn't have much time to get gear, nor did I really understand stuff too well, probably. As such, I went to raid MC with them wearing mostly "of Frozen Wrath" gear. I got the name "Pirkka Mage" or (paraphrasing) "First Price Mage". Good times.
---
You should check out a P. Server, just keep in mind it's not 1:1 exact but me and wifes having a very good time and it's the absolute best way to decide on a Class. I was dead set I was going to play a rogue but I didnt care for it too much, so I said Hunter would be a good class and it was but I think deep in my heart I prefer casters then I said fuck it Ill play mage which was fine but I played a Mage as an alt in Vanilla and i want something different so I tried a Shadow Priest, it was okay not bad and could heal if i wanted to BUT then I tried a Warlock. 100% I'm going to play a Warlock, I love the mechanics.                
---
                
---
I understand wanting it all to be fresh because I was also planning to do the same but I am so glad I didnt because a month in I would just now be starting over with the Class I really want to play.
---
People want to feel superior.  I think theres going to be a lot of surprised people when they see how easily many retail players can re-adjust.
---
I wana play ret so bad but I'm not gonna be handed BiS like these streamers to make it "viable".  I hope I'm wrong in the fact that I need God gear to be... average?
---
I don't watch wow streamers much.  Do they actually have large groups of people following them?  Also I would argue that WoW is a pretty big restaurant.  I would think the odds of running into a streamer with a flock of people following the to be pretty low.
---
So you have your most-used binds on 1 through =, and your slightly less used binds on alt + 1 through =. Works perfectly fine for me, not "awkward" in the slightest.

Fair enough. The earlier expansions had some light-hearted moments but were overall a lot darker.
---
Same here haha used to use that site a lot in wrath mostly. crazy stuff
---
Pets start at the level they are in the wild and have to be leveled all the way up.
---
It truthfully is not a hard adjustment. It's just making piece with the pace of the game, that's literally it. Just made the switch on a p server myself, was not a hard transition at all
---
I saw that actually, so much form swapping, makes druid look fun and high skill.
---
A legacyplayer link reveals a lot.
---
High damage and low speed for the lower levels. If you really want to be a try hard it's the best way to level.
---
You slow an enemy and then use a swing timer. Then you only approach to auto attack it and then kite it until the swing timer resets again. Very effective way of leveling with minimal downtime because you won't take as many hits as if you just stay on melee range during the whole fight.
---
&gt; I use Q, E, R, F, MB4, MB5, SHIFT+Q, SE, SR, SF, SMB4, SMB5, then 1 - 6, then Shift+1-6.
---
&gt; So that's 24 binds right there
---
And if you were using an MMO Mouse, it would just be "1 through =" and "alt + 1 through =".
---
Not exactly required at all, just makes things easier and simpler.
---
Yeah you’re right. Will concentrate on just getting ready. 😂👍
---
I dont use that one, but why not?  Theres lots of fun little toys in the game.  Quite a few arent really 'my thing', but oh well.  Theres plenty i do enjoy using, like one that makes a cooking fire out of a little burning wickerman (from the midsummer festival), or one that puts a little flag on my back.
---
Nu-male human
---
The greatest living classic wow meme
---
2h fury if you're just focusing on leveling
---
Arms if you plan on pvping while leveling
---
That would be a phenomenal meter but yeah sadly people don't look at the non damage contributions as being as beneficial for some reason. Those non tangeable contributions are hard to give a set value to though.
---
You can pull some decent dps as feral in raids but you need to farm pummlers from gnomergan for the on use haste effect that only has 3 charges. On top of that their rotation is one of the more complex ones in classic wow, its going to be harder to get gear, and it will be harder getting into pugs as feral dps. But if you put the effort in you can make it work.
---
Does the gold increase every time you respec?  Any cap?
---
Both DMN and DME are easy to farm as a mage. ZG takes a lot of skill and makes a ton of gold but you need really high end gear. 
---
I was thinking that Hunter took a ton of skill to solo DM tribute and had more gold per hour than any other class.
---
If I'm not wrong, the first level 70 was done with a whole guild killing mobs a guy tagget outside of group. I don't think they "fixed" mobtagging in vanilla.
---
&gt; You can’t enter the windy cliffs of Stonetalon Mountains for example, and expect to make it from Windshear Crag to The Charred Vale without seeing at least ten players from the opposite faction *just waiting to kill you.* 
---
This is mostly a Horde zone, Ashenvale had more PVP at the beginning. Although very early on there will be plenty in STM.
---
&gt; What happens if you choose to play Horde but down the line Alliance ends up being the main faction on the realm? Like, by a big percentage. 
---
Some prefer this and would honestly see this is a Pro.
---
Another big Pro for PVP realms, you learn way more about your Class than you would without the PVP side of things. Makes you better overall, and some of it does translate to PvE. 
---
Downside to PVE realms? Boring. You don't get the rush from WPVP. You don't get the satisfaction of finding that rogue that ganked you 30 minutes ago farming some leather and jumping him without stealth. You won't be as good at your class at level 60 as someone who leveled on a PVP realm.
---
asmongold i'd like to avoid. Sodapoppin seems like a douche. Someone here posted a video on this reddit with him and the warglaives of Azzinoth. He lost the roll and threw a tantrum. He still got the glaives and basically cheated the person won the roll out of them. I just hate the atmosphere most bring streamers bring to games.
---
smaller streams I'm fine with. they can go have their fun.
---
Mmmm... Shoe noodles....
---
Lol, i wonder what the version of 'kid' will be this time around.
---
&gt;HAHAHA, youre only *30*?  Bro, are you even married with 5-6 figures of debt and at least 2 kids allowing you to get zero sleep? LOL
---
This can be a PvE spec if you take the bear talents in feral (not cat) and actually tank stuff. You spend more time in bear than cat in PvP anyway so it works for both.
---
From OP's post looks like he is not gonna raid or rank. With classic timeline everyone will be prebis etc in phase 1 so its not problem. But when people get gear via raiding,ranking etc difference between him and enemy gonna be huge. He will gonna hit like kitten when ZG AQ patch hits, gonna get kited like NPC. Again gear is more important than skill if you are warrior
---
That can be fixed.
---
Instantly drop Earthbind and Magma Totems. Try to put your back to the Magma Totem.
---
The best part about Classic WoWs release will be never coming back to this sub again lol
---
Why thank you! You named a lot of the reasons I’m excited about our group - I just assumed someone would say it wasn’t. Thanks for your positivity! 
---
...maybe there is hope for humanity after all...
---
I leveled to 60 in Classic.
---
Yeah so?
---
In one sitting.
---
I ran Wailing Caverns on pserver recently. 2 hours or so. Best damn time of my life. New content is boring.
---
Ah that sounds lame that he'd throw a fit about something like that. I don't actually know much about him. Damn, popular WoW streamers can be childish at moments, even if I appreciate their advocacy for classic.
---
Yes officer, this comment right here
---
you must have been high
---
The Logitech MMO mouse has software which you can change what the buttons use as keys.  For instance side button 1 can be mapped to the "k" key or something.
---
is there a blue tracker specifically for Classic news btw? Asking for a friend.
---
I'm not a fan of 1 point in Nature's Grasp as a primarily Feral Druid. It's not reliable and it can start the diminishing returns on your roots at a bad time.
---
All very good points.  I’m aggressive at heart but I’m also interested in primarily healing.  I know the play style is also a little different based on your faction.  I hate how much I’m struggling with this decision :/
---
Going a resto/feral build is a very cool spec (even resto/balance for pvp but you won't tank) as you can heal and still do dmg/tank outside of raids. In terms of open world play I always loved druid versatility. The only times you'll really notice that they aren't top is damage meters in raids or when there's a wile and you only have a battle Rez. The only downside druid healers might have imo is that it's easy to overheal because of a long cast but if you're watching health correctly you can definitely be top healer with their strong/diverse healing spells.
---
It is. Staves are one of the best warrior weapons for the first 30ish levels
---
If youre a warrior, berserker rage/bloodrage, get ready to demo shout. If you're a mage, arcane explosion, but don't frost nova like a noob unless you KNOW they're there. Hunters can obviously just sit on their freeze trap. Rogues will never kill a good pally. Druid = natures grasp, bear form. Warlock and priest? Well, if you can't manage a solid fear... good night :/
---
yep.  this is about as accurate as this meme can get.
---
        1
---
Didn't EVERY expansion get slated at release and slowly improve, and by the end they were all loved?
---
No you can't. If you roll on a PvP server getting ganked and camped is just one of the risks you take. Nothing prevents you from 'streamsniping'. If the other person doesn't want their location to be known then they shouldn't be streaming. their fault for exposing themselves, not mine.
---
Running them vs playing on them is substantially different legally. Playing on a pserver is 36mph. Running them.... bigger ticket.
---
Depends if they spec for imp rejuv or just focuses on healing touch ranks. Regrowth uses so much mana that it's discouraged
---
The problem with the huge focus on Asian culture was completely ignoring the militarism of it. Outside of the Shado Pan, every zone was basically fat pandas gleefully ignorant of any kind of combat. Compared to every other expansion prior where there was always some kind of greater conflict at hand, Mop was absent of any sort of imminent threat which left the player staring at the same architecture while picking carrots and fighting off drunk rabbits. I get that the idea they wanted was a land untouched by war but it was horribly executed. Looking at paintings and adaptions of Medieval Asian culture, they totally dropped the ball on large swaths of content.
---
On 5.0 release they got rid of 25 daily cap on these quests and made all the amount of dailies that you needed to do (you needed it because you were getting lucky charms for bonus roll + reputation), I think it was more than 30+ dailies to do. These numbers were never a thing in previous expansions.
---
Ya Vanilla PvP has a unique feel for sure.
---
I dont think i could ever use one of the 'numpad' style MMO mice with a bunch of buttons on the side in a square, but i do love my G502.  Its especially useful for healing.
---
Lvl 11 really doesn't tell you much but really what you described is every class.
---
Kill. Heal. Kill. Heal
---
Kill. Eat. Kill. Eat
---
Kill. Drink. Kill. Drink
---
Warlock is one of the few classes where if you manage your spells you can really just keep on killing.
---
That link says it is 8.5DPS. Why would I want that piece of shit?
---
&gt;Hunters can obviously just sit on their freeze trap.
---
And Flare.
---
Warlocks just wait for the stun then sac VW, drop a dot or 2, deathcoil, fear spam.
---
I was in a tier-2 raid guild in vanilla, and we had both a feral druid and a boomkin who raided regularly. We were a few months behind the world-firsts guilds. We even had a ret paladin occasionally.
---
You really don't need to min/max for raiding unless you are trying to be in the top 5% of guilds. For the tier-2 guilds, the main limitation was time commitment, not suboptimal specs.
---
&gt;I can’t think of any downsides to playing on a PvE realm. So this is awkward.. Maybe you can though? 
---
1. Less sense of accomplishment (yes I know the EA meme but I think it's real here) by levelling to 60 after making it through such a chaotic system.
---
2. You say you can still wPvP, but it's not the same. You will never get the first hit, which fundamentally changes the game for many classes: warriors won't get their charge, hunters will be deadzoned, rogues don't get stealth openers, etc. Another example: someone can see your flag, call for a whole group of people, and then decide to jump you. The quality of wPvP you will experience will be greatly affected, in some positive ways and some negative ways -- but it won't be the same, for sure.
---
3. You will never be able to conquer resources like you can on a PvP realm. This punishes good players, and rewards bad players -- which makes it bad game design.
---
4. No faction wall. Being able to roll both factions makes the choice inconsequential. There may as well be one faction of pals. You can have alts and friends on both sides, and if you do manage to get some of that PvE wPvP you're talking about, someone can log on over and whisper you nice things like "u mom gay" and "no-life lmao".
---
5. Freedom of server migration. Should there ever be paid server migrations, PvP servers can transfer anywhere they like. PvE servers have to remain in their ecosystem.
---
6. Honestly, the lack of wPvP stress from PvE *is* a downside for many people. How many people would care about the Souls series if it was BfA easy? It's hard to enjoy games that are too easy, and since WoW is such a grind-heavy game, the looking-over-your-shoulder aspect of PvP is about the only thing that keeps you engaged.
---
That's why I do with mine. Just make it weird key combo's you would never use otherwise
---
I might very well die, its true. But i might also succeed. And if i start a territory war in game then ill chalk that up as a success too.
---
You are not wrong, unfortunately. I really love Paladins so it pains me to say it. 
---
I did one on a pserver two years ago. Grinding AB for the IBS was tiresome, contributing practically nothing in my mostly dungeon blues. Raided a bit in pick ups as holy. Never got any gear to help ret. it was slow and not very rewarding. 
---
Still will probably make a pally as my first alt though. Love them too much.
---
&gt; What's the consensus? 
---
There isn't a consensus on this Sub. One thread says one thing, one says the opposite. Either will work.
---
[Wow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dn5Tattkj_E)
---
steamsniping is new and different.
---
Mages are just the best ranged dps in late-game. Once fire becomes a viable spec nothing beats them. So having more mages increases your total raid DPS and makes bosses easier to beat.
---
Most good druids will have a resto set as well. You are one big multi-class.
---
is that some kind of reptile on that wall
---
Lol you’re delusional if you think blizzard would punish people for ganking a streamer
---
40man it with lvl 1s or you are just a pleb.
---
I think you can play ret, if you are fine with not excelling. Be comfortable with AQ20/ZG/MC, and maybe a pity BWL. You won't be able to chug flasks like on private servers, since the respawns will be MUCH lower. 
---
But, I think you should *still* play what you want. Just know, if you want to do end-endgame raiding, you should have another toon *also*.
---
I just tried it out myself and all the faces have the exact same eye shape. You could say that's because the eyes are actually modeled out this time whereas in the original models it was just painted over, but it is what it is.
---
I am pretty sure they gave you a free month subscription back in classic.  Not items or XP rates like today.
---
&gt;And blizzard has worked very hard to balance all the classes both in pve and PvP.
---
Sorry, in vanilla gear trumps skill most of the time
---
A noob in tier 2 will kill the skilled player in blues because the ttk is so short.
---
There's slight exceptions like when fighting your countered classes or 1v1 as a rogue with cooldowns up or a druid that can run away, but in general large gear differences matter more than skill
---
It depends what your goal is. DM Tribute run took a lot of skill too, and concentration. 
---
I used to farm lesser instances in my T2 hunter, I’d DE any rubbish greens, and vendor BOP’s, but the enchanting mats and occasional good blue or twink gear made good gold....and I could watch films as I did it.  I could easily get upwards of 80-100g from a couple hours running the deadines for defias gear and the cloth, enchanting mats from DEing.
---
Human in Cow Town?! What is this........
---
Undead is amazing for pvp.  Cannibalism is awesome for leveling too.
---
In vanilla wow, Hardiness is 25% chance to resist the stun.  It was hard to know when it worked.  Since warlocks and priests are already good matchups, hardiness may be better than WotF.
---
It's a meme for a reason.  Like all other meme specs, you will have to try hard consumes and gearing to put up mediocre numbers but you can be valuable if you work hard on it (much harder than an optimal specs would for the same results)
---
reading your comment then clicking on the picture LOL, thx for the laugh, blood elves would be the perfect race for tourists :D
---
Could always make a 19 Twink Retadin. They own BG's at that level.
---
Not true at all. Hybrids are an essential role in raids. You need more than 2 tanks for most trash and a lot of encounters, but if you run more than 2 Prot Warriors you're wasting their potential.
---
Tank / Heal hybrid Druid is a better offtank than a Fury Warrior. They put out more threat and they take less damage against mobs level 62 or lower (higher armor + no crushing blows). Most guilds don't use Druids this way because Warriors are everywhere and I think it's more common for a Fury Warrior to have a tank set than for a Druid to have one. But there's no reason why it doesn't work.
---
11/30/10
---
Give dps with the dmg and omen from Balance.
---
Gives enough talents to do good bear threat, better maul dmg, lower shred energy cost. 
---
And in resto we have Furor and faster HT cast time. 
---
It wont win any awards on mana efficiency, but with 20% more mana it doesn't matter much.
---
Sorry... I meant during vanilla... balance died when arena's debuted.
---
I vividly remember being a clicker for my longer cooldown abilities...we shall see if my gaming skills have improved during my decade off
---
"You just can't see me, as I've evolved in this ability."
---
What are you even talking about? We are talking about talents here, if you're fully specced into feral you lack the key talents to heal in a serious raid setting. You have no reflection, no improved healing touch and not even nature's swiftness. Has nothing to do with what set you have
---
No, go the whole 9 yards.
---
First start by repaneling your walls and make it that old wooden lining that all houses had that I can remember.  
---
Second, get a shitty small desk and chair that wobbles too much. Follow this by either a bad laptop or an old box monitor. Just downgrade your rig or cap all your games at 15-25 fps for max immersion.  
---
Third, have some old movie or tv show playing in the background while death metal plays softly in the background through some sort of speaker. If you want a headset, get one of those headsets that all indian tech support people use for some ungodly reason.  
---
Fourth, begin playing whatever old game you played at the time. Like Runescape for example, proceed to have your friends send you the texts.  
---
Finally, look at old articles about beta or alpha wow. Along with some screenshots. However, you may not use google. Preferably internet explorer to make it even slower.
---
yeah man, glad you did. I'll check it out now
---
25 man Sarth 3 d was definitely hardest of the tier, not 10 man. Zerging it made it obsolete, end of story. It had nothing to do with class stacking. It was split, Rogue, Ret, Dk, Enh, and a Fury warrior. That was the best comp for melee. And yes it was an easy raid tier, but Ulduar more than made up for it with hard modes and the baseline difficulty.
---
&gt;Actual representation of the population with sharding activated.
---
...I joke, but I hope there is still a MASSIVE miasma of people on day 1, even with sharding. I get it, you want to get to level 10 and have things to kill, that makes sense. But if the population level is to the extent that the Classic Demo was, that's a huge fucking shame.
---
I have played wow since the beginning and I have never leveled a shaman past lvl10. I just can't stand shamans.
---
No natural shapeshifter and no LotP, can't dps. Unless you're in a meme guild.
---
don't play then
---
Used to have mmo7, best damn mouse i have ever had for button placement. Too bad the sensor on it was total crap.
---
Someone should make a mouse with that thumb, 4 way hat again. Instead of wasd, you can just use the mouse to move. Still had a shitton of other buttons on it, but the hat under thumb was the best thing ever.
---
Eleresto spec
---
Agreed, demo was a fucking literal ghost town.
---
the multiple stat squishes that took place made 60 gear as good as (classic) 40 gear

I'll have to look him up. Thanks for the reply.

About Me:
---
I ran a fairly effective guild back in Vanilla/TBC. I played Troll Holy Priest main. Now I’ve got 3 kids, a wife and a career, so my family always comes first. But I’m still gunning for some serious progression. Our community is getting set up pre launch so we can go into Classic with a different kind of family from day one!
---
Sign Off:
---
In the darkest night, we are the light. Sol In Noctem.

---
I get you.
---
Personally, I sit in the #NoChanges camp, because I view Classic WoW as a restoration of a historically significant work of art. It'd be like modifying the Mona Lisa to "better appeal to a modern day audience"; even if I am part of that modern day audience, even if I think it would make the art better, I don't want to see it happen.
---
But from a "living game" perspective, for all the Achievement system's flaws (and I think it ultimately did more harm than good), it did an AMAZING job at finally providing recognition (and incentive) for in-game activities other than levelling, raiding and PvP. I wouldn't want to implement the achievement system itself, but there are some individual achievements that I wouldn't mind seeing integrated into the game in some other form, such as Loremaster, Explorer, and that achievement to raid the enemy faction's cities and kill their leaders.
---
I generally think of Bloodsail Admiral as the prime example of "this is basically an Achievement, but done in the style of Vanilla WoW." So if any "achievements" were to be implemented, I'd like to see them done in that kind of style.
---
Yeah that's just flat wrong. If you run 0/30/21 for HOTW you can easily put up respectable numbers. Are you the best healer in the raid? No, but you are a very solid contribution. You can also DPS on fights where you don't need the extra tank/healer, and you are factually the BEST Decurse bot in the game since you have the highest base mana pool and your heals aren't as valuable as a main spec resto.
---
Even in some encounters you will heal AND tank. Druid way more versatile than you think.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG5P71m6D4g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG5P71m6D4g)
---
Yeah, I can see the advantage. I've used the Naga Hex for a few weeks and it took me a long while to get used to that, I feel like I'd need a decent amount of time with a 12 button side mouse to appreciate it.
---
Some people prefer different binds so something easier and simple for you might be a pain to learn and get a hold of for others.
---
I still would like to have an MMO mouse and play with it for a few months and see how I do.
---
I was gonna clean my room...
---
I think I normally quit around the water totem quest. Not necessarily *because* of the quest, but everything that seems cool about a shaman is just SO far out of reach. Chain heal, Chain lightning, just to name a few.
---
Usually guild mates will inform you if someone of value has left.
---
I have no idea, have been trying to find a new one, not used, and always something wrong. Either delivery for another mouse's price, or not delivering abroad, or out of stock.
---
I recall that I was googling so deeply, that I found some webstore in Pakistan - but was quite anxious about accepting a package from there...
---
Hyjal's closed
---
Paladins - slow levelers  
---
shamans - I play alliance....
---
Druids are a fantastic all rounder class, feral is very viable for Raiding.
---
Last two runs I had at Vanilla wow servers I played Feral myself in one (we had two ferals in raids and 2 main tanks)  So could run 2-3 Tanks depending and have 4th feral ready just incase.
---
Feral dps in full dps mode, try hard (actually decent bit of micro going on to do it correctly) is actually damn good, if you max out your consumables and use Crowd pummelers on each boss encounter your honestly capable of doing some great numbers, keeping up to Warriors/Rogues even.
---
That as well as the utility they bring I think having 1-2 Ferals in a raid is a no brainer.
---
Good thing Logitech just re-released the G MX 518 :D
---
I was thinking about playing Rogue, but I'm wondering if I should settle for a weaker rogue that can do other stuff in druid.  I think druid is my most appealing class for open world, but pretty damn low appeal for raids.
---
I typically only use 1-5/6 on the number keys. I use q, e, r, t on the next row down for abilities (wasd for move forward/back and strafe) as well as f, g, z, x, and c. Throw in mouse 4 and 5, along with scroll wheel up and down with plenty of shift and ctrl modifiers and I usually have way more binds than i need without having to dance across the keyboard much, or move my hand far from the movement keys. 
---
MMO mice suck for me because I squeeze the mouse hard enough sometimes to mis-press the buttons...
---
Literally? She's near the road between camp mojace and Cross roads. Shes on the ground in one of the huts.l
---
Beef comes from Taurens.
---
Don't @ me.
---
leveling on a pvp server can be frustrating but i couldnt imagine being 60 and stuck on a PvE server.
---
In that case you have a couple of options neither of them are amazing.
---
A) Use some sort of potion like swiftness to get back in range.
---
B) Engineering device to get back in range.
---
C) CC the pet, run away, then intercept the pet when it's close to the hunter and fear immediately. This is hard to do and even if you do it correctly, it does leave you vulnerable.
---
Ah word, makes sense.
---
Also human males. I tried replicating the look of the human on this [wallpaper](https://i.imgur.com/zuWNUXB.jpg) that was posted recently and I couldn't. And before anyone says that's artwork, it's clearly ingame models painted over a bit. All but one or two of the human male faces in retail look like retarded knuckleheads. Same for characters with special models like Khadgar. It's like they decided that all humans now genetically look like Beefy McChunkhead.
---
SWTOR body type 4 ftw.
---
For me I never levelled a mage or warlock.
---
I quit about 2012, had an 85 level hunter, shammy and pally. A 70 rogue and priest.
---
Personally, I'm still battling between running a Druid or a Warrior with emphasis on tanking.\
---
Advantages of a Druid: \
---
- easier to gear early on during pre-raids / mc
---
- similar to above: not much competition for gear
---
- can perform two roles using one specc (tank/heal or tank/dps)
---
- pretty good to solo the world
---
Advantages of a Warrior:\
---
- will always have a spot as a tank
---
- will get that thunderfury that we're all dreaming about
---
- will ultimately be better suited for the endgame compared to a druid for most (not all) fights
---
- interesting metas with Fury-Tanking
---
Thing is, both have strong disadvantages:\
---
- Druid can't use anything in his forms (potions, healthstones, engineering)
---
- Warriors on the other hand can do and therefore have to (lots of farming, leveling engineering)
---
- Warriors will be more difficult to gear early on and will have lots(!) of competition on practically every single slot
---
- Druids are having a pretty hard time during BWL when it comes to gearing. You're literally waiting for AQ40 to become available because MC and BWL loot is all just "meh"
---
- Druids kind of "have to" go farming the Crowd Pummeler for pew pew single target TPS to throw out some TPS that warriors can only dream of
---
So if it's a tank-hybrid you'd be intereted in then Druid is really a great choice. Don't ever believe anyone saying that a CLASS is dead or weakest - it's just bullshit. Every class has playable options, some stronger and more meta than the others, but they all work. Surely there's some dead speccs (moonkin-druid, survival-hunter) but that doesn't make the whole classes the "weakest".
---
As a roleplayer (read as: person who spends way too much time looking at how various gear looks on my character), some of Classic pieces (especially cloth ones) look surprisingly good even on modern characters.
---
Pretty much anything that isn´t too detailed still looks good.
---
Would caution against any "accounts" of it, people embellish it a LOT at this point. At least on my server it happened once or twice and then just about every chat/forum was spammed with it so people knew what was going on.  After that point there were still the occasional events, but it was more like "ugh, auction is f'd again by some annoying troll trying to make a name for themselves"
---
i know the Mankriks wife has been a meme since day one, but everyone should do that questline.
---
read the quest text. immerse yourself. put yourself in mankriks place.
---
it is truly great.  the rewards might be mediocre, but they fall in line with RP of the quest.
---
do it. live it.
---
Priest, shammy, hunter, pally.
---
I pvp'd rogue in vanilla. Paladins were definitely quite formidable oppenents. Even gear and skill, the Paladin is going to win. However, if the Paladin is less skilled, and the rogue can make good use of stuns/interrupts as well as energy conservation based on timing/reactions to the Paladin's health and especially mana pool, then the rogue has a decent chance.
---
WINDFURY.   
---
I will say, Ghost Wolf really kept me going on it. It was so badass having something that most others didn't. Hunters' Cheetah was only 30% and they got slowed if hit while it was going. Ofc, the Druid one was better, but the Shaman one looks cooler. But, it can get dispelled =(.
---
Yes they do, but it’s not going to be an issue for anyone but them. It’ll only cause an issue with the huge streamers like asmongold, Soda etc. And they won’t be able to do anything outside of instances with the swarm of autismo’s following them around so it’s not like you’re going to constantly be competing with a swarm of people killing everything in sight like the whiners on here seem to think. The only thing that would suck would be the excessive queue times on those servers so if people care they just have to not play on those few servers...
---
It's quite simply really, the pro of pvp realms is you get to gank people, the con of pvp realms is people get to gank you.
---
natural shapeshifter is only needed for powershifting. In normal fights hoping in and out of Bear doesn;t happen too often. 
---
LotP can be gained by moving 1 point from HT cast speed. .1 seconds shouldn't be too much of a loss for LoTP.
---
Well, that's true. But you can still both tank and heal.
---
The thing with tank/dps, though, is that you can shape mid-fight into a cat, when offtank is not needed. You won't deliver as much damage as you would in dps gear, but still better than a typical tank.
---
BUT BUT
---
In some situations, the healing could be a bit useful even if you're DPS-specced, and in DPS gear. I can't recall ALL encounters right now, but there may be some situations when more healing is needed, let's say for 10 seconds, and the raid may cut a bit on healing, by telling DPSes to heal.
---
And, as far as I recall, druid is the only class with reliable dps build and healing spells.
---
Druids have the lowest numbers when it comes to raw healing, thats a fact. Doesn't make us useless for that, did I say it does? I literally just said that we have the biggest toolkit in the game lol doesn't get more versatile than that. And what was the point of that video? I already said that we can tank/heal or dps/tank in one spec.
---
"To combat streamers who ruin the game I will ruin the game for streamers so that their game is ruined haha showed you"
---
Few things. 1. Some people just don't like PVP, so it's a no brainier for them. 
---
2. No faction wall can go the other way. Maybe you have a few friends who play but they don't want to play on the same faction. Convince them to play on a PvE realm and you can join then both. Although I admit Classic isn't a multiple main kinda game. But leveling is a lot of the fun. You decide. 
---
3. Neither of us have facts to back it up, but to say that PVP realms will have more active battlegrounds might be true once bgs release, but I think long term the subsection of people who like PVP in Bags but not WPVP will start to populate the PVE servers more. They might start on PVP servers to have a little bit of fun before BGs though.
---
4. *Tapping the lense of my webcam* 'get out of my PC and leave me and my OST playlist alone'
---
I will agree that the Sha was not that compelling to me. "Fight your emotions... literally they're just some adds in this boss fight." Sad? fight it. Angry? Fight it. Doubt? Fight it. Literally fight it with a damn sword.
---
One does not simply walk into Hyjal
---
I like the looks of that build. Thanks for the input.
---
I just hate the way cloth classes look and operate. Anything restricted to cloth only is a no go for me.
---
Sounds nice, ty for the info.
---
&gt;and I could watch films as I did it
---
Underrated statement. I played mage and could farm zg, but after a couple hours of it I just wanted to log off. Dmn is way less g/hr but it's easy and completely mindless. I could binge a few hours of tv or even get some work done and end up making more overall.
---
Go roll on a private server for the next couple months. Don't level past 20 on any class.
---
This. When it comes to these kind of things we'll probably rely just as much - if not more - on external websites as we do when it comes to retail.
---
Eh, you are really only moving a finger so not like you are completely unable to move.
---
I main healer and use a lot of mouse macros, never understood needing an entire action bar on the mouse. Then again, I use it with Clique because it helped me with not having to target off of raid frames. Still, such a huge bar makes it annoying to have to remember the exact position of each spell, at least for me.
---
Honestly, I'd agree. I leveled a pally in late BC when it was much easier, but it took alot of slow chunking away. I think that kind of eased me into it, and now I can't wait to play the class again.
---
I'd love this. It'd be really complicated but perhaps a function of:
---
Damage done \[adjusted for class/role expectations\] + Healing done \[adjusted etc\] + Healing received \[adjusted\] + Damage received \[adjusted\] + utility spells cast \[e.g. Innervate, Battle Res &lt;3 pet drood!\].
---
All rolled into one simple number, with a rogue's damage obviously compensating massively for their lack of healing done, and a tank's healing received meaning little compared to a hunter. Etc.
---
&gt; How many other Druids are running it?
---
What does the number of other Druids in raid matter?  He said he tops the heal charts, not that he tops the heal charts of just the Druids in his raid.
---
WoW Vanilla 40man raids typically take 10-11 healers.  Druids can top heal metres with the nature's grace/regrowth spec, this throws out low rank regrowths and procs nature's grace.  With 5pc T2 you get regrowth cast times to 1.3s.
---
It really isn't unusual for a regrowth spec Druid to top heal metres.
---
Of course, whether topping heal metres = good healer is another question entirely
---
Firstly, all specs are useful and viable in 5-mans, non-healer hybrids are welcomed for their buffs and do competitive damage; the lower damage or inefficiencies in mana that we see among hybrid/off-specs in raids are mostly due scaling, raid buffing, and prolonged fights. Druids of any class will be welcomed while leveling or in 5 mans, they offer great utility regardless of spec: Hibernate for beasts, MotW, Thorns, Battle Rez, Innervate. The only real issue I've experienced with a Druid in 5-mans is the lack of a normal rez if they are the sole healer/there's no hybrid in the party.
---
In raids, Druids are pretty good healers but have some limitations. Most raiding Druids rely on Rank 4 Healing Touch for efficiency and to prevent over-healing, this is a solid and efficient heal but it is slower than Paladin heals which are especially efficient. The biggest issue with Druids in raids is each target can only have a single version of any give HoT, so HoTs don't see much use for raid heals mostly due to heal sniping/topping off HP. That said, it is very useful to have a Druid healer on the MT to keep HoTs up and provide Swiftmend in an emergency. Overall, they fill a good niche and bring some great utility, they aren't as efficient as Paladins for single target and they lack the raiding healing of Shamans but they're a solid healer to have around.
---
In PvP, Druids have tons of options. While they tend to lack the burst of other classes, they are incredibly slippery, mobile, and tough to kill. A Druid who uses their entire kit in battle is a force to be reckoned with. Also, Druids are the best class for escaping combat if things go south w/ Nature's Grasp, Cat form + Dash, Travel form etc.
---
Overall Druids are an incredibly flexible class that is very fun and stimulating to play given the number of options you have. They are rare and the class has a tight-knit community, they have incredible mobility, very unique and powerful utility options, and they have the largest toolkit of any class. I don't think they are nearly as bad as people make them seem, most of the hate they get is due to not having a super strong niche in raid healing which is only one aspect of the game. It just depends on what you want out of the game, people who value being the best any single may not like the Druid but when you play one they feel fun, diverse, and powerful as a hybrid.
---
Lol people see class balance in the title and instantly down vote it without even reading.
---
Farming crowd enough crowd pummelers to use it every fight sounds uh... tedious, to put it lightly.
---
How could I forget windfury :P One of the joys I'll never experience. I don't really play melee dps that much anyways, so whatever. :)
---
Rolling Horde in classic and I was really looking forward to avoiding Jailbreak. Are you telling me that the Horde questline is \*worse\*?
---
you wont ever succeed not ever. they will have 5 pocket healers
---
Oh man. Speaking of bug fixes. I miss that brief period where arcane missiles had infinite range. That was hilarious. When they first made it so you could switch targets and have each tick hit a different target they forgot to do a range check on each tick. So you could stand at the blacksmith in AB and start casting AM on a critter, then switch targets to a player standing at the farm and blast them with arcane missiles. 
---
I think that only lasted a couple days before it was hotfixed.
---
It's not "easier and simpler". You now have one finger to control all of your spells and much less real estate in terms of buttons. I know you can get plenty accurate with your mouse after enough time, but there is 100% a higher chance of misclicking on an MMO mouse than a keyboard given button size. This is very annoying if you are like me and have rather large hands.
---
I have no desire to roll a druid because they are a master or none. I also don't have any intentions of playing a Paly as I have no intentions of playing Alliance.
---
At that point deep shadow. 10/0/31
---
&gt; Depends if they spec for imp rejuv or just focuses on healing touch ranks. Regrowth uses so much mana that it's discouraged
---
Learn the meta before you comment.  This is the standard regrowth spec that gets regrowth cast times to 1.3s with 5pc T2.  The idea is to downrank regrowth and rely on mana pots, runes and innervate to keep going http://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLxf0xoZZxecocaV
---
Here's the logs for a Regrowth spec Druid topping the heal-logs on AQ boss fights  https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Viewer/?id=32307&amp;exp=0&amp;upl=51113
---
Powershifting is what makes dps even viable in the first place for us. If you remove that you're gimping yourself hard, would be straight up at the bottom of the dps list. Why take a good class that can do 2 roles with ones spec and turn it into sh\*t just to say "look at me I can do 3 roles in one raid" ? You're missing key talents for both healing and dpsing with that spec. Just go for heal/tank or tank/dps and do a better job at those two roles.
---
You have to travel around the world a few times. It is much more time-consuming.
---
But on the other hand you don't have to do an overly long escort quest, so that's a plus.
---
A E S T H E T I C
---
Plus, seems like Perplexity is just messing around with various strategies and could beat him consistently if he wanted to.
---
How tedious is it to farm Crowd Pummelers?  Sounds horrible.
---
&gt; Looking at W3, the art style of that feels a lot closer to the new models to me
---
Just how do you even get that idea?

---
You think these are closer to retail's models than to vanilla's?
---
If you run a raid with all Druids, it matters. Even if not, it's a variable. As a comparison, if a hunter said he topped dps meters on his raid you'd want to know who he's competing against.
---
Human Shadow Priest and then I made a Blood Elf Shadow Priest once I realized that my blood was horde red. I also made a Goblin Arcane Mage. 
---
For classic - Playing Tauren Druid for the first time. And probably a Tauren Shaman. If I have time I’ll make a Troll Shadow Priest and an Undead Frost Mage, just for old times sake.
---
I understand if the peaceful nation theme doesn't fit well, or is poorly executed. Though I disagree with it necessarily fitting \*every\* aspect of Medieval Asian culture. I think Warcraft ultimately borrows aesthetics from historical civilizations, but isn't necessarily looking to reproduce them. Vrykul are certainly Vikings, but Vikings were not former titan constructs trying to regain favor with their lost gods by sleeping for millenia. Nor were Vikings necessarily as violent year-round as the Vrykul, that's always a bit exaggerated in pop culture. 
---
Overall they borrowed the style of Asian architecture, art, and geography, and then adapted it to completely different origin story with a different culture.
---
Private servers are not like Vanilla. Especially when it comes to ressources
---
what armory.... what logs ;) this is classic not retail
---
Druid hots overwrite each other in Vanilla so if he was the only Druid healing in a raid his meter could be artificially inflated.
---
Heh, fair enough. Was thinking about it though, I don't think I'd mind leveling any class. Did Shaman and Lock in Vanilla, had a twink rogue. I was thinking about it and most classes seem like they'd be fun to play. No Paladins though. Not only am I not going to play Alliance this time around, even if just as an alt, I hate Paladins. Fucking Bubble Hearth.
---
Yes, and some people play Skyrim as a naked futa klingon berserker, doesn't mean naked futa klingons fit into Skyrim's style.
---
Thats where i'm at with leather/mail. Not tanky enough to have huge armor, and not squishy enough to have awesome defensive spells.
---
Someone posted the idea of compiling a list about which streamers were playing on which servers so people could avoid them, which is a nice idea. Unfortunately, this means having to wait for streams to start first. Worth it to avoid the 'autismo's following them around' as you eloquently put it.
---
Pretty sure RAF didn't exist at all in classic.
---
It didn't even exist in TBC until like 2 months before the Wrath Pre-patch.
---
I won't call anyone a tourist in Classic, even if they clearly are.
---
Won't worth the time and the effort of typing it in a chat, simply because I won't met them again in 1-2 weeks.
---
But would you hate *being able to* Bubble hearth? You hate it if you ain't it.
---
Do you normally have music on loop? That would get annoying for me. I like it where it plays the song when I'm questing then when it finishes listen to the ambiance. When it comes back on again I'm usually in the mood for it.
---
Most big streamers (Not All) will be rolling on PVE as they want to rush to 60 and try for world firsts as well as get level 60 PVP started. They don't want to hassle with real world PVP.
---
Yeh it’s worth the grind especially for melee dps that need all the hit they can get. I used it as a tank to try and smooth out threat generation.
---
&gt; but there is 100% a higher chance of misclicking on an MMO mouse
---
I never misclick the buttons. The rows are tilted at different angles specifically so that you can feel which row/button you're on.
---
"illegal" thats cute
---
The biggest con of a PVE server is honestly boredom. Sure if you’re looking for the casual relaxed route and watching Netflix at the same time then this is for you. 
---
Coming from EverQuest I wanted nothing to do with PvP because melee classes were terrible there. You also had to be careful not to carry too much coin, wear garbage resist gear, and melee bind points made for long runs. So my first character was on a PVE server and it was weird seeing a horde run by and you couldn’t even talk to them. I later rerolled PVP and have never looked back.
---
For the time being I'd prefer they stick as close to 1.12 as possible. But once guilds start putting Naxx on farm I'd like to see them put out an expansion for levels 60-70 that keeps the important parts of vanilla wow. 
---
That would be their opportunity to balance the classes. I would just be very upset if the "balance" the classes by homogenizing them into a hazy paste like they did in Cata and MoP.
---
Do all roads look the same to you?
---
Regrowth gets double value on pservers, you get both +heal from the hots and the direct heal. that wont be the case in classic. If you look at most logs on legacyplayers, its just that spell that puts them on top.

A group of me and a bunch of friends camped Sodapoppin for about an hour.  We got a soft ban (I think it was for a couple of hours or maybe 1 day or something).  After seeing what happens to FPS players who loose ranking from Stream camping I have grown past the idea of ever doing it again.  It's an unfair advantage.  I will however love the chance to take on a streamer in fair PvP content in the future should that ever happen, minus the whole watching their stream thing!
---
That's the point. For $360 a year you cant really get much. So if you pay that and play wow 20 hours a week, you're saving money because if you were doing other things during those 20 hours each week, it could potentially cost a lot of money. $15 for one month of wow is at least 100 hours of entertainment, ass opposed to paying hundreds of dollars to go to bars, go bowling, go to the theatre, buy other $60 games, so on and so forth.
---
This is my hope :)
---
&gt;I already said that we can tank/heal or dps/tank in one spec
---
Yeah but the point is you can do all three in just HOTW spec. You won't be the absolute top in any area (except tanking on specific fights) but you will provide value via your versatility. A Feral tank doing DPS as cat on fights where the extra tank isn't needed is way better than a Prot warrior doing DPS.
---
Video was just to show that there will even be encounters where you perform multiple roles in JUST that encounter. So tanking -&gt; decursing or tanking -&gt; healing or tanking -&gt; dps. But to think you won't do all three roles even in one spec is not true.
---
&gt; Sooo much bounce
---
When was too much bounce a *bad* thing? ;)
---
Well, to be fair, warrior really is the worst to level...
---
Whirlwind weapons - Can do in early 30's and the axe will last you well into your 50's.
---
But if it's the only way you can get a nature's grasp off? How else are you going to peel a melee off of your, hard cast entangling roots?
---
Yes, I was asking him if he personally really needed it as it doesn't really fit PvP.
---
&gt; I literally top the HPS and overall healing done with the least amount of overheal on every raid as a resto druid.
---
Then your other healers must be absolute hot garbage. Not saying this to insult you, I mean that Priests/Paladins are literally, objectively, better healers in terms of HPS than Druid is, so if you truly are #1 on healing in every single raid on every single boss, your other healers must be terrible.
---
In Europe the game came with two 10 day guest passes, and that was it.
---
I wouldn't call that "stoic" as more of a "Painted on lips".
---
But the downside of PvE without Salvation.
---
Yes, the thought sickens me.
---
Not really though, just a Horde fanboy. I did play a BElf Paladin a bit in BC, but I only ever got to like level 30 or 40 or something.
---
That’s good, I couldn’t do DM or ZG farming unless I concentrated. But doing lower instances with a gorilla let, explosive trap and volley meant fast Aoe farming and good gold per hour, while I barely looked at the patrols. Haha. 
---
ZF in Tanaris was another great gold maker 😀👍
---
Lol, I just watched this last night. Very nice.
---
never say never.. I have a few friends playing with me and they love to start zone wars. We'll make a guild event out of it. And even with a lot of healers people still drop pretty quickly in vanilla
---
agreed, most people are set in their ways thinking having multiple tanks in mixed specs, mixed gear sets etc.  Additionally forcing more warriors to get more BIS sets for off tanking.
---
Where in nearly all encounters Druids can perform the OT role easily and use largely seperate gear set.
---
50g
---
Not seen this before +1
---
You can still powershift lol, you just can't shift in and out of cat as many times due to the higher mana cost. This doesn't stop powershitinf from working. it just lowers it's dps. 
---
This spec is not ideal for DPS, or healing, it just a thought, as it can do all 3 roles to varies degrees. It tanks better than dps or heals for sure. Only missing armor, which isn't too much of a lose, but missing Imp enrage is a  bummer.
---
I think you're gonna get a lot of hate on this forum. Best of luck.
---
Fire in BWL = God
---
You can heal instances as Shadow, Ret, or Feral. It just makes it 10% harder. Pre-60 content normally isn't harder enough for 10% to make or break you. The rough part is if you level ret or feral you need to keep two sets of gear...
---
&gt; If you run a raid with all Druids, it matters
---
WTF are you on about?  Who actually does that
---
Thanks for establishing you're talking absolute shite
---
I'm all for an option in the graphics menu. Specifically because it's already in the game anyways. 
---
Personally, the new models stick out to much. Everything else in the game is on a 2004 visual fidelity. An entire graphic rework would take away too much time from other projects though.
---
Me and my friend gonna play ally gnome mage and human warlock
---
I checked the blizzard policy briefly and try to google and related forum discussion. Once again very briefly, and all i could find was a mod saying it was unsportsmanlike conduct but nothing that was a breach of service to be punishable.
---
druids, why play the ultimate hybrid when you have every class?
---
You could damn near buy a new mount doing the netherwing questline/dailies after getting epix flying.
---
I was waiting for a punch line. 8 minutes and not a single funny moment.
---
staff is only for early levels (1-30 maybe) before you get the 2h specialization talents, because there are such good staffs in that level range, like staff of westfall or crescent staff
---
You can bind them to numpad numbers (and the other numpad keys). They are different keys than the number row.
---
Yeah I know, my good friend plays with one and does just fine, but personally I've flubbed plenty of inputs on it due to hand size. I wasn't saying that you will misclick, just that the chances to misclick are definitely higher.
---
"Way more serious, and bad ass"
---
More like "Way more polygons" :V
---
I wouldn't say the difficulty is brutal, once you know the quests you can breeze through it plus it leads up to silverpine which is one of my favorite zones aesthetically. Overall I just love the entire story of Loredaron and the forsaken.
---
Warlocks are insane, always a higher demand than supply which is one of the few classes you can say that about. Also so many god damn buttons for Vanilla, my friend's warlock PoV has like 6 stacked action bars between consumables, random warlock buttons, and the actual relevant keybinds.
---
exactly, Druids and numerous other hybrid classes bring essential components to raids, Rebirths/Innervates/Emergency off heals/Ankh/etc.
---
There are numerous moments where these things get used or tested in a raid enviroment where it isn't as simple as having a bare minimum raid filled with fury warriors and a absolutely maxed out dps setup that is 'optimal'.
---
Sure if your trying to get best clear time speedruns done, sure.
---
That doesn't mean its the actual optimal setup for a reliable raid to get through 100% of content with the least wipes.
---
750hp Muscle car vs a refined 500hp awd.
---
Which one is more controllable and gets to the finish line more reliably, albeit sometimes a bit slower.
---
Hell yeah. I played Warrior from TBH through WotLK (I never played during original vanilla because I couldn't afford a PC), and I played Arms for PvP and would respec Fury for raids, so I remember loving the Orc racials for that.
---
That would be insanely cool, would love to play an actual orc looking undead.
---
SAME :D
---
I'd take Trisifal over Westfall any day. Both for aesthetic and practical reasons.
---
If by "underutilized speccs" you mean like ele shaman spriest and oomkin, the gear's there, they just don't use it.
---
Does anyone have tips on leveling as a hybrid resto shammy? Like which talent tree should I prioritise? I've also read that enh/resto is stronger than this build?
---
I just love the story of Loredaron and the Forsaken, plus it leads up to Silverpine Forest which is another one of my favorite zones.
---
I wouldn't say mediocre numbers unless you're in hardcore guild. With full consumes on equal gear ret can definitely compete with others who of course don't use that many consumes.
---
ALL WE HAD TO DO WAS FOLLOW THE DAMN ZEPPELIN CJ
---
You're right. Never in the history of this game has ANY guild ran all druid healers! You are wise beyond your years oh amazing one!
---
Orrrr, you could learn to understand rhetorical questions and the fact that variables must be factored in, regardless of how seemingly unimportant they are. Good try though. A for effort!
---
HOTW is a tank/heal spec. If you're not tanking, you're healing. Thats the whole point of the video lol. Nowhere in the video is Skarm dpsing. Your dps is dogsh\*t with 0/30/21. There is literally no reason for you to dps in catform spamming claw for 200 (lol) instead of healing. You're either dps/tank with full feral or healer/tank with HOTW.
---
Server: Nerz'hul
---
Guild Leader: Rang Rang Liao
---
The guild leader setup a website to signup for his "Communist" guild. What I mean by this is if you agreed to his terms everything you earned and found that was green or better and most of your gold would be given to him. In return he provided appropriate level green items for your class every 5 levels until you reached 60. At that point you had priority in Raids and drops in those raids. I don't remember exact numbers but I believe it was mentioned that his main character was worth over 10K gold after a year or a year and a half.
---
Maybe it's not gamebreaking for you, but I'll take that rectangle any day over looking like the goofy comic relief.
---
Question:  
---
I never played a shaman past 39 or so because I was Alliance 90% of the time from vanilla to WotLK, so I decided to look at a talent tree for elemental/restoration and decided I liked 31/0/20 for PvP at 60 with the capability to heal dungeons on the side.  
---
Is Mana Tide Totem \*that\* much better for PvE than Elemental Mastery is for PvP? I see lots of people talking about 30/0/21 and am curious if they know something that I don't about Elemental Mastery that makes it unworthy in their experience?
---
I don't know who Asmongold is, but based on my youtube recommendations he's a dude who's job is to react to shit.  All kinds of shit.  And makes a silly face every time.
---
I'll be your huckleberry. 
---
Just make sure you roll alliance.
---
Fair point my opinion was from a hardcore raiding perspective
---
I actually really love the way male orc warriors look too, but I figure I should change it up and advance the narrative of my old char
---
i think once geared, in later tiers like AQ40 and naxx, that resto druids can start fighting for the top spots on the healing meter, at least that's my experience, but I might be wrong
---
I got a SteelSeries Rival 500 in preparation.
---
Because I’m in my 30's, and teaming up with badass edgelord children just isn’t how I want to spend my precious free time.
---
Will you come back if you're visited by the California Raisins?
---
Shaman / Paladin. You CAN do it!
---
I've lost count of how many times I've listened to this.
---
Priest. Always priest. It's just so god damned boring. It's very safe, sure; most mobs can't break through your power word shield, and mind soothe effectively gives you stealth. You stack spirit and wand things down while staying at full health and mana. It's just SLOW AND BORING.
---
I like being a cat, prowling around, sneaking past stuff, giving surprise heals out of stealth. 
---
I never hit 60. Never had any BIS or any good gear. I just fucked around a bit. Never was in a guild or was serious. 
---
I learn a lot from posts and comments like these. Most of it goes over my head but that's fine. I'm not the serious player like most folks here. You all seem to really know the math behind the game, what to expect and how to be the most efficient player you can be. 
---
I've heard of end game raids, big groups, long time commitments, and everyone working together to take down a rather large boss with phases. Sounds like a military mission sometimes. It's the kind of organizational skills that should get you hired on as a team lead in a job, given how much work is involved.
---
Ahh yes hypothetical raid compositions are super relevant, not.
---
Moron
---
I love raiding and instancing. Questing is fun for me too. I don’t want to level while being ganked over and over by someone who see’s that as fun.
---
I’ve got kids and a good job, so limited to 2 maybe 3 hrs a night during leveling....so don’t want to spend it corpse running. 
---
I got to rank 12 doing BGs in vanilla and loved it, so will get all the PvP I want there. World pvp was still great when alliance attacked TB or undercity!  And horde we attacked ironforge several times. Never did manage a raid on stormwind, would have loved to see that! 😂👍
---
Nah this is the best one imo:
---
https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ
---
Well this would be the wrong kind of bounce!
---
Which yeah, I agree with. It completely ruined playing male trolls for me and the females always had a wonky run to begin with :(
---
Monk, not a fan of them at all
---
I combed through the wayback machine to verify and found they did indeed have recruit a friend back then.
---

These video's  really helped me decide: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiGcT3dOk5iAZ8woMatxbKvfM1rMzKivz](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiGcT3dOk5iAZ8woMatxbKvfM1rMzKivz)
---
Other than that I would recommend trying some classes out on a private server.
---
I don’t know what to tell ya, it happens to me! I can’t provide any pictures (as all my 15 year old data is all on a computer that no longer exists), but I did get a soft ban.  I remember it being really odd because I never thought it would happen as the TOS didn’t distinctly say you can’t camp someone.  I’ll look to see if he has any old videos.  I did play a private server for a bit though, so I could be confusing the two.
---
The evidence for his statement is all over legacy players
---
https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Viewer/?id=32307&amp;exp=0&amp;upl=51113
---
These guilds are doing MC,bwl and aq in one night so clearly they're not bad
---
I’d say step back and decided not just what class you want to play, but really look at what you are excited to do endgame. Are you mostly gonna pvp and do some pve content? Are you going to join a raiding guild and hardcore raid? Are you going to do a lot of farming and messing around with some pvp/pve thrown in there?
---
Tank and even ret pallys are fine for everything except hardcore raiding. If hardcore raiding is your goal though, I’d say go dps warrior or mage. Personally I’d say go warrior because mage is easy mode.
---
Yeah it’s great. I feed off of the hate I get when I tell people I’m 40 boxing classic lols.
---
it is tedious. Keep in mind though that it has 3 uses, so 1 pummeler will last you 3 bosses.
---
I mean, it's not simple.
---
Maybe if you are looking at things completely optimally, but there will be times where the extra tank and healer is not needed. You could sit and bring someone else in or just play suboptimal dps for a fight. It's not perfect, but it will definitely happen. Of course your main focus is either dps/tank or healer/tank but it's not true to say you will never DPS in that spec.
---
Wasn't in Vanilla.
---
for you and other neckbeards, literally no one else cares if it has pandas, because they know that mop is about horde vs alliance with weaved in old gods
---
Another thing about Bloodfury I don't see mentioned here:
---
The attack power buff switched from only Melee AP to just "AP" in general in TBC. So Hunters actually got a benefit from the Orc racial where in vanilla it only buffed melee AP making it basically useless
---
One of my favorite episodes haha
---
I will probably never level a druid, rogue, or pally.
---
I will absolutely level
---
Shaman
---
Warrior
---
Priest
---
Hunter
---
I am not sure which order yet but will be starting with Shaman and then probably priest or mage. All the while collecting gear for my warrior so that he has gear throughout leveling that i don't have to buy on AH
---
1.12 client, I can't recall, but probably not. The modern/classic client has had guild invite/leave/rank history for a long time.
---
Why do people hate Jailbreak so much? It's so easy and takes maybe 30 minutes tops. Clearing the trash is easy and then the escort itself is easy.
---
Alliance just has to complete an easy kill quest, then go back and forth between Burning Steppes / Lakeshire / Stormwind to talk to NPCs, then go back and forth between BRD and Burning Steppes a few times, do an easy escort and then run UBRS once.
---
Horde has to do a full LBRS run, then go to Org, then go to Desolace, then go and find Rexxar with his massive patrol route, then go do UBRS, then go to Dustwallow, then do 3 elite dragon quests which are in Tanaris, Winterspring and Swamp of Sorrows, then go back to Dustwallow and get 1 more elite dragon quest in Wetlands, then go back to Dustwallow AGAIN, and then go back to Desolace, and then go do yet another UBRS run.....and to back to Desolace YET AGAIN to finish the chain.
---
It's a pain in the dick compared to Alliance because there's so much more travel involved, over both continents, whereas Alliance is mostly just back-and-forth within the Stormwind area, with a couple easy trips to Winterspring.
---
If a druid is offtanking then he should be full feral doing cat dps when he's not tanking rather than hotw. There are no encounters that call for more tanks and less healers or vice versa.
---
the only way I could think of it is if you ended up in a group with someone and you win a need roll or something above them you might get mass hate messages or griefing later.
---
that being said just find out who the streamers are and avoid grouping with them.
---
they had to have been high. Horde is nothing but UBRS runs, looking for a little shit in Desolace, and killing some world dragons..... soooo much better than Allies shitty jailbreak.
---
It is tedious to say the least. And you’ll also be farming juju’s, mana pots, runes and plenty of other consumables. If you’re off-tanking, you’ll also need to bring tank consumables. It’s a high maintenance spec, definitely not for everyone.
---
Enjoy your $600 a month epics? Lol.
---
To be fair though Warriors and Rogues would still be up there on the usefull meter. 
---
Not sure who would be at the bottom, hmm. Vanilla had good class design for sure.
---
Yeah that’s why it’s the most popular expansion ever right /s
---
I'm very much for the "no change" camp, except for the cross realm battlegrounds. That was really a relief and during the bg your fighting anyway, no time to be social or inspecting. Not being in queue for an hour or more also was nice.
---
well TBD if we'll get an armory or not... they haven't said either way if theyll have an armory and wowapi for web like live does.. but if their data is managed the same way it should be next to no work to implement so they may.. not sure.
---
otherwise your point stands. but we shall see no one has really brought it up on this sub that I've seen.
---
Just let us know which PvP server you decide on for the 2 for 1 HKs :-)
---
Multiple warriors being outdps'd by hunters, they seem pretty bad to me.
---
That’s the spirit dude. Love me some faction conflict. Make sure you give their stream a /wave when you’re on top of their corpse
---
I'll take the "I just heard a dirty joke involving two trolls" grin over "ermflglergh (My lips were pasted shut".
---
It's pretty much this.  You can do really good damage as feral, you just have to put in 5x as much work as a warrior or rogue.
---
Been playing druid on vanilla servers since 2015, never in my life have I been asked or seen someone be asked to dps as 0/30/21 because healing "isn't needed". And in no druid guide does anyone ever say that you sometimes DPS in raids with that spec. You would be doing less damage than your main tank.
---
'Best Rogue' is pretty situational, and subjective. Rather be UD against a lock, any day.
---
Can we stop and appreciate how that 1 video just got blown the fuck up out of nowhere by reddit conspiracy theorists?
---
None that remove an effect that's already on you without also sharing cooldowns with other consumables.
---
Hah funny thing is, that’s 95% of the time not his doing, but someone just using clips from his twitch streams to make YouTube money. Asmongold didn’t really have a YouTube presence so people just been pumping out videos with his name on it....with silly faces
---
Title says you're 'Thorn', so it's safe to say you should go druid ;)
---
in this specific example you're probably right. druid in many cases make a superior offtank to some fury warr with meh tank gear
---
but in general specializing &gt; hybrid
---
it's not like cata was doing good before wow and wod was even worse than cata, mop put life into wow after cata.
---
I never said that mop was the best xpack, imo it was tbc.
---
MoP did many things right, but i suppose you never experienced that, because "hurr pandas", it had the best class design, even though it had gimped talents, rotations were perfect for most specs, it had great music and scenery and the raids were mostly spot on.
---
No they won't, and they shouldn't.
---
a lot of people will have a sort of 'culture shock' when they first start classic.  they might be annoyed at not being able to kill 5 mobs at once at low levels, having to buy skills, eat/drink all the time, etc.
---
i felt these same things when i tried a private server last year. iwas used to faceroll WoW. i got a bit annoyed and frustrated. but i quickly adapted.  the differences in the game, the need to ask other players for help, it was part of the game. and a good game, at that.  
---
hard games, where you have to do a bit of planning rather than just dive in head first, are still popular.  dark souls and the like.
---
so yes, help the people that are angry and frustrated, because this is something new to them.   there is a good chance once they figure it out, they will love it, and you might have found a new in game friend or guildmate.
---
Warriors shred rogues pretty handily in my experience, as a rogue player.  You can try to keep one incapacitated and stunned, or try to drop some bleeds and kites, but I've always had a hard time with them.
---
Paladins I won't even bother fighting. Ret Paladins tend to wreck rogues and even if they didn't they're just too hard to kill.
---
As a (ele) shaman I've had great luck destroying mages. Purge and a well timed grounding totem, and then a lightning bolt-chain lightning shock combo usually does the tricks.
---
So does this build just spam low rank regrowths?
---
I’ve played one recently on a Voldemort server, and yeah, never again. It’s been fun, and there is a lot to appreciate about a druid, but I feel like I’ve gotten the best ends of the stick leveling 1-60, and I’m happy to sit out the raid experience.
---
Can I offer you an egg in this trying time?
---
Are you saying that healing gear double dips on private servers making actual throughput different, or just that the logs report it wrong?
---
Sorry, rereading your comment I misinterpret :)
---
omg finally. time to activate my trap card. 
---
https://imgur.com/aiQfTqY
---
One time I was able to lure a gold farming bot using a mob so that the mob would die when the hunter was near a fire. it would then try and heal up with food/water before moving on, however since it kept taking damage, it would deplete all its food and then eventually die to the fire.
---
It depends on which code they use for it.
---
The original cache was effectively just a regular chest with a different model, which is why the old rules applied. In the client that classic is based upon, there are many boss cache spawns that operate with normal corpse/masterloot rules (Legion client examples: Cenarius, Frosus, Guldan, Kil'Jaeden, Gorothi, Eonar, Argus).
---

---
Why would you need more than 1-12? Just configure your action bar around it. I use 1-12, shift 1-12 and crtl 1-12. That’s too many, I normally end up binding multiple mounts to the last 6 keys because you never need them all!
---
Gross
---
One million percent agree!!!!!!
---
Raise a little hell! Raise a little hell! Raise a little hell! This is what classic pvp is all about baby! Keeps the severs lively !
---
Warlock - something about this class does it appeal to me in the slightest.
---
Rogue - as someone who originally played on a pvp server, this class annoyed me. I will never play one.
---
Shamans - I play Alliance. If I did have a horde alt to play with a friend, it would not be a shaman anyway.
---
Druids - That’s all we needed, a(nother) Druish princess.
---
(Ok, not really in-game reasons, but to sit behind the toon for hours on end I have to mentally attach and enjoy them. And I can’t get behind these classes.)
---
Shamans counters pretty much all 3 primary casters. Earthshock, Purge, Tremor Totem, Grounding Totem. Using a nice 2H and a decent WF hit tears through their dresses and does good damage. Maybe slightly less so against Mages since they don't have a fear to bait out.
---
What a perfect line.
---
What part of carrying anti-venom is wrong, though? It's a pretty prudent measure. I always have some on my rogue as lots of mobs drop a long duration damaging poison which is irritating for stealthers, and cleansing potions later.
---
favorite leveling zone hands down for me
---
As much as I want to main warlock (they’re so fun and OP for leveling too) I agree, something puts me off to them.
---
But that's the difference, it's style vs complexity. The old style was better and truer to the game's lore. I can bridge the gap between potato graphics using my imagination. Coming from WC3 where faces had even less polygons, that's easy. What I can't bridge is mine and everyone who looks at me's impression of my perpetually laughing-gassed character.
---
TBC is the best era in wow history, in my humble opinion. It improved on many of the weaknesses of vanilla without totally scrapping a lot of what worked. The only thing I really didn't care for was how people got funneled into HFP. It was a ganker's wet dream.
---
Oh I will
---
You could...just take those items off, if you were concerned with the RP thing.
---
part of being snowflake dps, gotta do some unorthedox things to make yourself keep up with the warriors/rogues.
---
But I mean not every raid leader is going to be as harsh to threaten to replace you with better ferals that want to be top in the server.
---
The logitech one not only let's you bind the side buttons to whatever keys you want, you can also write scripts allowing you to bind keys that arent even on your keyboard. It also comes with a ring finger button which is pretty unique and I love it. I have f24 bound to it which discord recognizes as a key so I can use it for ptt and it doesnt conflict with any other key press.
---
Hi, /u/DHenderson97
---
Because this sub is full of douches. The community in game will be worlds better.
---
Nothing... never said it was. But most people, especially in the launch rush, are not going to worry about it. That's more something for the first or second alt wave.
---
Some Questions:
---
1. Will i have to join a server and be stuck on that server and not be able to play with other people on other servers? (as it was in vanilla wow). Will i need organize all my friends to one server in order to play with them?
---
2. Can i make an opposite faction character on the same server?
---
3. Will item drop be the same? Will there be need/greed and will there be an optional master loot, as opposed to the current "personal" loot that people receive?
---
4. What was the current player count per server back in vanilla, and what will it be in classic release? same? more?
---
5. Will there be raid tools such as the star/diamond/moon icons, and flares to orgainze 5mans/raids? It was a tool added much later, perhaps in wotlk if i remember.
---
6. Will battlegrounds such as WSG and AB be server specific which on original release were?
---
7. Will there be battle groups, which were brought later in the wow lifetime.
---
8. Will there be Looking for Dungeon?
---
9. Will loot tables still be the same? Will an alliance guild that kills a Molten Core boss have a chance for Shaman item to drop? Will a boss only drop if your super lucky, up to 5 items?
---
I have a million more questions, but for now these are the few i could quickly just come up with.
---
Does anyone have one that's good for big hands? I'll be getting a new one before Classic and the Naga was too small.
---
Is it easier to get things or harder?
---
Shaman raids DPS falls into two categories: 
---
- Enhancement: Your best contribution is totem twisting and white-hitting the boss. Reasonable DPS, but it's a major bump in DPS for the melee in your group.
---
- Elemental: You do great DPS as long as you have mana. Problem is, you don't have mana long. You can blow tons of consumables and hold out a little longer, but your damage is really bursty and - over the scale of a raid boss fight - pretty short. Viable, but expensive on consumables.

If a Paladin is what you really wanted to play, be a paladin. If I'm recalling correctly they make okay dungeon tanks and the buffs are always nice in raid. You don't need to be the Best healer tank or DPS class to get into raids. Just because a class is good doesn't mean the person playing it is good. I used to raid back in vanilla and my guild had several ret paladins, we still cleared everything up to AQ.
---
Good! As long as everyone is having fun that's what the game is about!   
---
Ishnu-alah!
---
I wanted to roll that spec as well as a support/heal shaman in classic, but then I saw someone do the math and it is so not worth it at all to skill into that.
---
True. It's just weird how they ignored the war aspect in a game called warcraft
---
I remember that there was a good totem for them.
---
Depends on how much time you spend in these zones.

Thats what i call „classic“ ❤️
---
wow almost a complete opposite to mine lol - i plan to level pally -  rogue - druid, and i quite prefer the zones listed as hated. 
---
But i could end up passing on the zones listed as fav's lol, at least i dont hate them tho. After attempted leveling in the new expansions i don't think i hate any vanilla zones anymore!
---
They could have at least pushed forth a stronger monk militia presence, considering the Pandaren lore.
---
Not being able to have horde + ally characters on the same server.
---
Wow, forcing mages to lose all of the pvp and farming parts of frost for 3% spell damage and crit. It makes sense if your raid exists in a vacuum, and the characters don't matter afterward...
---
I came here to say this
---
Paladins are a fun class fantasy tho so it kinda makes up for the slow leveling.
---
Did you just answered beforehand to the guys who replied ? O_O
---
You can make any class combo work. I’d just pick the two you want to main at 60. Ideally have a healer so you don’t have any downtime. 
---
Questing is your best bet. It won’t be hard to quest once you get the hang of it. I use isboxer and when accepting/completing quests I just press a keybinding to interact with target which opens the quest window, and then broadcast my mouse to all windows to accept/complete the quest. 
---
Unless you have a lot of experience multiboxing id advice that you don’t try to run dungeons and if you do only do double dps since healing/tanking and doing decent dps simultaneously can be tricky. People tend to blame you for everything when you’re multiboxing and the group wipes 😋
---
If you don’t have any experience you should mess around on retail with multiboxing to get a feel for it since it’s going to be pretty much identical on classic.
---
1) yes 
---
2) yes
---
3) need/greed plus normal looting rules (FFA, round robin, master)
---
4) 2500 iirc, which is less than original 
---
5)idk
---
6) idk if they are doing that or bringing back battle groups
---
7)
---
8) never
---
9) faction only, I believe bosses drop 2/3 items
---
If you're a horde damage leather class, the Gnomeregan quest from Orgrimmar gives some amazing blue Agility pants that will last you a long time.
---
+ healing counts for both values. it shouldent. i played rdruid in vanilla aswell as has done it on pservers. its to much healing on it, thats why its so strong and druid healing meta has changed from Rejuv+HT to Regrowth, on pservers.
---
I played mop, instances were a face roll. The lore was so boring and out of place that I just did not care. LFR showed me more of the same.
---
You can talk about mechanics all you want but if the story is trash who cares?
---
The art, music and level design was done really well.
---
Story is still garbage and the theme does not fit within the Warcraft universe. There are multiple other races that deserved an expac over fucking pandas.
---
All other healers have a 1.5 and a 2.5 sec heal. All other healers can buff thier tanks with 25% armor. All other healers can Res. 
---
Druids get a 3 sec heal that scales crazy good. It becomes super effecient with +heal. So they can heal pretty good. If you get to heal the tank you can top the healing meter just like all the other healers can. 
---
So you make up your own mind if the things a druid can't do makes them weaker or not.
---
The Golden God has spoken.
---
Awesome video, reminds me of my first time playing, I was on my desktop and my friend was on his laptop, I kept making fun of him because I had 30+ FPS and he only had like 10-15, nonetheless we still leveled and had a blast.
---
If that's your video, how well did your friend's laptop run WoW if you remember?
---
&gt;	Another approach I have been taking is just not playing video games as much so when classic hits my wife doesn’t kill me. 
---
This is what I’m doing pretty much haha. Well put.
---
The naga ones are way to small for my big hands but I also like the original Xbox controller ;)
---
Hunter - weird ass boring ass class
---
øi øi øi!
---
Why wouldn't the hot portion benefit from +heal effects?
---
[https://youtu.be/FvpeiEca6og?t=46](https://youtu.be/FvpeiEca6og?t=46)
---
IIRC depending on the raid comp/content you're running, moonglow can be a better healing spec than traditional deep resto.
---
For players with larger hands might æike some customization, Ive been using the Roccat Nyth for ages. I'm loving it.
---
Yeah both are strong and both may have solid points... it's all subjective.
---
But the people acting as though MoP did nothing wrong and that it wasn't the final nail in the coffin in terms of the death of what made the OG WoW great.... are being incredibly disingenuous.
---
it should be cut in 50/50. not add +heal for both.

I experimented for a while trying out different combos dual boxing on private servers. In the end I decided it's just not as fun as playing one character, you never feel like you're playing one class well, or are in control trying to juggle multiple characters of different classes. The way around this is to just play 2 mages or 2 hunters in sync, but even that felt lame as well, even if it is very effective.
---
the only reason I wouldn't want to do that all the time is that you can bring 35-40 over-geared people and be done with Ony in 5 minutes or MC in 40 while fucking around and not using consumes.
---
I can believe it. I once had a GM threaten to temp ban me in classic because i said in trade chat i was going to sell someones testicles. For context i was trying to sell an item in trade chat and someone else was trying to sell the same thing but kept undercutting me by 1g. I was young and this annoyed me so in trade chat i said 'WTS 'playersname's nuts'. I got a warning within 20 minutes by a GM telling me i cannot use the human anatomy in an improper way. makes me laugh to this day.
---
Maybe years of some retail players shitting on people wanting classic had a part to play.
---
Good times!
---
After a while you get mana gems, evocation, which helps a bit. Talents also allow you to down mobs fast and more efficiently with things like shatter combos.
---
But you're pretty much right, Mage is the one class where drinking is unavoidable.

---
But I like fat chicks.. hm..
---
if you're ending the fight with mana, you're wasting potential.
---
if you dont' need to use that mana to heal, why not dps?
---
Alliance all day every day. I started as an alliance player in vanilla. Became a horde player because of my friends in retail. Can't wait to go back to the Alliance again. Raid me some Orgrimmar and kill me some thrall too!
---
The more you know ;D cheers and ty sir.
---
Isn't that in duskwood at the cemetery off the path to Deadwind Pass? 
---
You can also hear the Frozen Throne Arthas' Return cinematic in Undercity
---
Oh, please.... "True to the game's lore". Thoe only people who can make that assertion are Blizzard themselves.
---
It really should be 
---
"Ah yeah, here we go again."
---
Elemental isn't viable before level 40 because the most important talent to put out respectable dps is the reduced cast time on LB/CL, which is deep in the tree. Level as enh to at least 40. 
---
Past 40 you can respec, but I wouldn't recommend it because there is a severe lack of good spell power mail at that level AND you need to drink a lot. Do it if you really want, and you have a mage friend willing to give you a few stacks of water for questing. It's probably slower than enhancement. 
---
You don't need to be resto or even have points in the resto tree to heal anything before level 56+.
---
Alliance may be more difficult PvP-wise due to racials (somewhat countered by paladins) but Alliance wins by far PvE-wise.  Paladin is far better than shaman in raids (better buffs + unlimited mana for heals + cleanse).  PvE-wise they also have better racials (human sword skill + dwarf fear ward) although that is relatively minor compared to class difference.
---
Wyvern sting is pretty terrible in organized pvp and you have to give up scatter shot to get it.
---
0/30/21 for counterattack is a legit build for pvp if you see a lot of rogues and warriors.
---
0/21/30 for lightning reflexes might be good for people with naxx gear (my hunter was an alt and never had that much gear)
---
There is no way I'd give up scatter shot in PvP tho.
---
Oh don't worry Dee, we boil all our denim.
---
Mulgore Street. Home. At least it was before I fucked everything up.

Haha this is 100% true

Dats not good for u
---
Hey I know Janitor and Hiddens, I'm surprised they're playing together after a certain previous encounter
---
Eventually I'll level all classes, but hunters and rogues are the least interesting to me.
---
That is where I am thinking of.
---
Impressive, and welcome.
---
They don't. U must do your stealth shit in between dot ticks
---
Back on Ely our guild (and other friends from the server) would pile up in BRM to wipe Esfands guild.  We did this often enough they would attempt to change raid times/days to avoid, but we had inside knowledge so we knew when to be there.  
---
Esfand at this time only wanted to stream his raids, so was funny to hear his excuses when his stream began late.
---
Good times were had.
---
I don't think you can turn on old models anymore.
---
I was wondering when somebody would already point it out.
---
Major important quest here!
---
WoW community is supposed to be about what you do and say in-game, not how many viewers you have on twitch.
---
do you really want to be on a server where 60% of your faction is just a streamer fanboy and trade chat is just constantly posting twitch emote words?
---
People trying to use the word tourist as an insult just remind me of Tokyo Drift. I've seen that movie way too many times.
---
BRO this is for classic wow only!!!! None of that pserver garbage!
---
I played an EQ private server (EQ vanilla basically) and then heard via reddit about classicWoW I think through pantheon reddit.  Considering reliving my EQ days was fun (although it had buggy problems due to the nature of private servers) I have pretty good expectations for WoW vanilla 2.0 and at worst it should be a fun ride.
---
He asked if I was on it. Not if that picture was taken there.
---
Biggest mastery is kiting and keeping enemy out of your dead zone. As a hunter, you outrange every class, so maintaining that range is important. You need to know how every other class tries to close the gap, and act accordingly. Mastering knowing when you can switch to cheetah to gain distance is key. 
---
An example of one small tidbit vs mage: 
---
If a mage blinks toward you towards your dead zone, I mainly use a scatter shot right away. This often buys me a few seconds to get out of frost nova or cone of cold range. They will often iceblock the SS but even still it gives you at least 1 second (often more to get out of Frost nova range). Assuming you are now out of cone of cold and frost nova range, most Mages will use a fireblast. That’s your cue. You can now switch to Aspect of the cheetah since they no longer have a way to daze you. Now a really good mage will notice you getting away with cheetah and try to sneak in a rank 1 frost bolt, so to counter you feign death interrupting their cast and then proceed to make them cast it all over again. At this point you should have good distance, potentially you are now far enough that even when they blink again, they are still not close enough to deadzone you and potentially you have now just outranged them altogether and they can’t touch you now, so you proceed to blow them up. 
---
It’s fun skill matchups like this that can make hunter so complex
---
Definitely guilty of calling them that
---
Good to know. Thank you!
---
watching a stream to find out where they are isn't much fun. Watching the stream to see them bitch and moan about being ganked is what its all about.
---
full value from +heal, then you gain the increase from crit on top of that, its a big number all of a sudden.
---
Sounds like you want rogue. Badass armor sets but still squishy so they use defensive spells - evasion, blind, vanish

You are correct.  Kazzak isn't in at launch.

---
I bought the soundtrack back in the day for vanilla WoW I still play it when I need to chill. First night elf I got to Ashenvale is just remember feeling so... Mythical and elfy. It really made me dive in deeper.
---
Lol everyone says this, but most players on pvp servers never gank others, and never have any intention of ganking. I've played on PvP realms for 5+ years now, probably 10+ characters levelled to 60, and I doubt I have ever killed someone for no reason. It's just not fun for me. It's just like smurfing in Starcraft 2 or Dota- purposefully losing 50+ games so that you can beat up noobs. Yes some people do it, but the overwhelming vast majority of people don't, it's just not fun.  
---
Most people play on PvP servers because it makes the game feel alive and dangerous and fun. At least 90% of the interactions between the factions while levelling on PvP servers are not aggressive, more often than not you just completely ignore each other. The actual gameplay is exactly the same as it would be on a PvE server. But because the names are red and you *could* attack it makes it way more fun. That is why people play PvP.
---
I find multiboxing much more fun than playing 1 character especially in vanilla. In a world of 1-2 button rotations it’s nice to have more stuff to think about.
---
It's because he got social anxiety and can't bear talking to people In a mmo
---
I think the eye of shadow also has a small drop % off elite demons down in blasted lands?
---
Is it better than Smoking heart of the mountain &amp; Mark of Tyranny? Where does it see use?
---
It was a guaranteed drop from Kazzak but any high level demon could drop it. I think we farmed it up in winterspring alot of the time if I recall right.
---
What the hell does 1 point get you?
---
In 1.12 the eye drops from elite demons in blasted lands/winter spring so it’s hard to say for sure if it’ll be available or not.
---
They used to have this as the Scroll of Resurrection.
---
The elite demons in winter spring also have a chance to drop the eye.
---
They are AMAZING Innervators!  I’m a priest, so I loves me some Innervate.
---
You have the Boomkin dance!  Yes, you have to have a ridiculous spec to get this, but.... Boomkin dance!
---
Druids are not the best smelling in animal form.  I’m tired of watching them slide their itchy butts across the carpet.  Why put up with them?  Boomkin Dance!
---
People are overestimating the ganking. Like you, for instance. Of course you will be able to enter stonetalons and no, there will not be a Raid dedicated to kill you at all time in every zone (except in phase 2)
---
Is there even wow classic streamer
---
And Winterspring, IIRC.
---
I would like to eventually level every class - except Paladin. That class bores me to tears.
---
Agree with you. Dont understand how anyone thinks its fun to oneshot people 40 levels below you
---
Yeah, I think a lot of players leveling their first character we're turned into "neverrogues."
---
Yeah exactly, wow had been on the decline for years before MoP even came out but Reddit acts like it was some golden age
---
That's fine, the pro of a pvp server is random open world pvp, the con of a pvp server is random open world pvp.
---
Oh noes, internet people don't agree with how I may choose to enjoy my free time!!!
---
&gt; I started as an alliance player in vanilla. Became a horde player  because of my friends in retail. Can't wait to go back to the Alliance  again. 
---
Are you me? My story is exactly the same! I might add that I did go back and forth alittle in between at first, before settling with the Horde. Though I'm not done with my 673823 times of changing my decision between which faction I'll eventually pick. #struggle :-(
---
Lol yeah that’s gotta be it
---
Our PVE server back then had a lot of wpvp skirmishes in crossroads, it was great fun but most importantly you had a choice of joining as a low level.
---
I will never understand ganking someone in STV 20 levels lower than you is considered pvp. Thats just griefing to me and why should i allow some no lifer that pleasure?
---
Besides i actually think that PVE servers BECAUSE they havent done pvp through levelling to 60 are more keen to join the BGs, i know on our server back then queues were not a problem.
---
You're not a loser for playing on PVE, you just get your thrill for downing bosses over players.
---
Don't forget the 2 endless corpse run in that cave in winterspring...
---
Personally, I'd pick once i found a guild i wanted to raid with and what was most helpful to the group. Having hybrid classes that can switch on various boss pulls is awesome.
---
Did you just combine by two favorite things, Sunny and Classic WoW?
---
Automatic upvote.
---
"Raene's Cleansing"
---
..because then I can not finish it, and keep that sweet, sweet [Dartol's Rod of Transformation](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5462/dartols-rod-of-transformation)
---
Yea that's what I thought. Sort of hoping the new rules applied to old content asell. Im not that hellbent on 100% nochanges, so this would be a welcome change for me 😁
---
But a dot tick will take you out of stealth right, so no way to clear it and them vanish?
---
My plan was to use /follow. Will that bring my slave character close enough to NPCs and such in order to interact with them? As I recall there was a 5 or so yard Gap when using follow, but I could be remembering wrong
---
Yes the Linkin quest line that is a legend of Zelda reference. I came here to post this but you beat me to it!
---
No slurs please.
---
Yes abbreviated slurs count.
---
That's fair, but I never played Warcraft 3, I didn't even know about Chen until they announced MoP lol. It was a great expansion despite my disinterest in the pandaren though, I spent so much time hunting the rares for their unique toys. Plus the farm and cooking was a nice break from raiding.
---
Can't agree with this at all, hybrid druids are actual trash compared to a fury.  You have a druid with no aura, therefore no melee group, camped in group 7 or 8 with other healers then all of a sudden he's tanking something?   That alone is a recipe for disaster, most healers are not very good at tank healing anyone outside of g1/g2.  Further, fury's actually fucking own.  Shield + dstance is just as effective for reasonable mitigation as bear form, and shield wall, shield block, tclap or disarm are all reliable ways to significantly reduce incoming damage that a druid has no access to.  When the snap tanking job is over, a fury goes back to being literally number 1 dps material, whereas a full rdruid has to fight tooth and nail to stick with a priest on effective healing.  Can it work? Yes.  Will it be anywhere near as good, assuming equal skill players on ideal roles? Never.
---
The Golden God in all of his glory.

Gnomes are by far the worst with this, the males all went from looking like jolly annoying kids to looking old and wrinkly, while almost all female faces look super grumpy.

The other day while messing around on a pserver I got unstealthed by a campfire and she'd a tear of joy

Hey there,
---
Saw you mentioned it was a PVE oriented guild- will you guys be rolling on a PVE server or PvP?
---
Not OP but cool videos.
---
Ah yes but we're talking about the lore and how much of it was pulled out of Blizz's ass.
---
You could get that to work but if you use isboxer it has built in macros to toggle on click to move when you press a keybinding to interact with target so it makes all your slaves target your target, run up to it and interact with it with one button.
---
I played alliance in Classic and Wotlk. then switched to Horde after. Alliance have a much better story line against Onyxia (i guess Nefarian too by extension) and Arthas than the horde imo. Also the one thing that drive me insane about the horde is how they are all hunched over and the tabard looks like crap.
---
Don't insult users. "Soyboy" is an insult.
---
This will be done in your name.
---
&gt; You say you can still wPvP, but it's not the same. You will never get the first hit, which fundamentally changes the game for many classes: warriors won't get their charge, hunters will be deadzoned, rogues don't get stealth openers, etc. Another example: someone can see your flag, call for a whole group of people, and then decide to jump you. The quality of wPvP you will experience will be greatly affected, in some positive ways and some negative ways -- but it won't be the same, for sure.
---
True but most PVE servers just did wpvp events, the events were highly popular back then i remember. Also if you really wanted to show who was boss there were Duel option.
---
&gt;I get it, you want to get to level 10 and have things to kill
---
TBH the main reason I'll login day 1 is not to level, but just chill and see what everyone is saying in /2 :)
---
Will choose a server and level properly once the crazy mayhem/bugs die down a bit, and can get a better idea of server populations
---
It's very good into 60. If you don't have enchanting for Smoking Heart of the Mountain, it's one of their pre-bis tanking items.

Smoking heart is so good b/c armor is multiplied in bear form.

I think OP was talking about combinations actually in the game
---
Use an ability in front of me to make sure you have it. Basically it's the leader micromanaging and being a douche. Sure, if you demand mana tide as a raid leader and you find out later someone defied you, punish them. But to baby them before the raid even starts is a level I'd never stoop to.
---
Since you'll be healing in dungeons and raids as you said, I'd say that ret is much better for leveling/PvP than prot is.
---
This post looks like it was written by a Boomer - even the phrasing is there.
---
Quake, an FPS, is still played today - multiplayer private servers, and played by speedrunners to see who can beat it the fastest. Plenty still play it.
---
Classic is the same - it has a dedicated community who have enjoyed it for over a decade on private servers, and many more who want an official version.
---
Saving this :)
---
But seriously?! Who cares? IT IS A GAME. Let people enjoy themselves. Leveling my two toons or taking them through a five man will in no way impact anyone else.
---
So good. Goosebumps every time. I agree that Elwynn Forest does it for me as well. Teldrassil is my trigger song though. I'll never forget starting that Nightelf back in 2008 and living through the confusion and slow pace of still quite-vanilla WoW. Wandering around in Shadowglen for the first time, then eventually marvelling at the capital of Darnassus once you make it. Then of course the eye-opening moment when you make your way across the Veiled Sea for the first time, en route to Darkshore, and you realise just how big and grandiose this world of Azeroth is. Unreal.
---
Double lol
---
Yeah, my comment was more of an aside than an actual continuation of the conversation
---
"Boomer" on the internet is different from actual Baby Boomers. It seems to be a rotating age category instead of a definitive one - late 20's and early 30's type of people who are growing older and prefer the games of their youth. 
---
*\*sips white monster\** yep, now that was a game.
---
Elwynn Forest+Westfall+Redridge+Duskwood+STVdoesitgetanybetter?
---
It doesn't really change the example that I named.
---
Why bring a Rogue if you can bring a Cat that does the same DPS but COULD potentially throw in a few heals or a battle rez if the need comes up or supply a Healer with Innervate?
---
This is the main reason why they probably put in a Hybrid Tax, you might not be great at everything, but you could potentially -do- everything.
---
Rogues, Hunter, Warlocks and Mages are stuck doing just Damage.
---
Rogue-druid is a solid combo. If you spec feral and pick up the tanking talents you'll be able to make finding groups much easier and remove one of the more frustrating aspects of the game for new players.
---
It also makes a solid combo for when you decide to gank someone. Imagine she opens with cheap shot into kidney shot while you ravage and shred into ferocious bite. Whoever you target first is going to explode.
---
I have one of them, and I just couldn’t get used to it properly. My thumbs are kinda stumpy so I couldn’t accurately hit the button i wanted, as well as them being kinda stiff. I didn’t think the 12 is that useful. I did kind of adapt and use 7-12 on the mouse and 1-6 on the keyboard, but even then.. meh. I wouldn’t purchase again.
---
In terms of my play style I’d probably get a mouse with 4-6 programmable thumb buttons that are easy to distinguish and use them in conjunction with the keyboard
---
**Features For All Healers**
---
Stat Weights dynamically calculated given your choice of healing spell and rank. Stat weights are based on the effect of +1 stat point on the "Total Healed In Fight" stat. Option to set custom stat weights instead of using the pre-calculated ones.
---
Full gear lists sortable by value based on pre-calculated or custom stat weights.
---
Stat Calculators that calculate all of the healer's stats given comprehensive selections of gear, talents, buffs, consumables, etc.
---
Stats for every rank of every heal calculated from the healer's stats, the fight length, and other factors. Most notably the "Total Healed In Fight" that represents the total amount that can be healed during the fight if only that rank is used as much as mana permits throughout the fight duration. "Heal Completed %" refers to the percent of time the heal can be spammed during the fight given the constraint of mana and helps the user to decide whether a higher mana cost heal should generally be used.
---
**Known Incomplete Features**
---
Trinket use effects not implemented. Trinket sheet in general needs some work.
---
A few talents and set bonuses not implemented. All such cases are clearly marked with triple asterisks.
---

Comment above was referring to warriors
---
Yes it only broadcasts in game macros to do its fancy stuff. There’s no actual automation in game it just makes all the wacky macros for you and makes it much easier to broadcast them. 
---
The isboxer developers are very active and have never had someone banned for using their software over the like 10 years that it’s been in use.

Wait until you make friends and join a guild and see what they need
---
What is the purpose of having a 19 twink rogue? Is it literally just to play WSG? I made a twink back in vanilla, played a few games, and never logged into the character again because the 10-19 WSG doesn't have a lot of depth to the classes. I understand if you like stomping people on an OP 19 rogue, that's totally fine, but there's so much more to the PvP fights in the later game IMO.
---
Lol if shadowpriests/enhance were at the top of the dps charts and warriors were getting benched for pallies to tank raids it would be an improvement? GL with that.
---
EM is worse than NS beyond the initial stages of gearing at 60. However, taking it at 40 and levelling as 31/0/++ to 60 is the best choice as you will not have NS access until 60 anyway and EM can delete people between 40-60 in a burst combo. 
---
There is some play for EM in coordinated PvP as it will set up a insane crit if you can pair it with a ZHC/toep and good communication.
---
They announced it blizzcon November 2017. Though I’ve wanted it since wotlk- since 11/3/2017 is how long I’ve been on this sub everyday. Kinda crazy
---
&gt;The biggest con of a PVE server is honestly boredom. Sure if you’re looking for the casual relaxed route and watching Netflix at the same time then this is for you.
---
How would PVE content not be boring aswell on a PVP server?
---
I assume you're talking levelling here?
---
boi she dont look 18+
---
wow look out we got a badass over here
---
Correct. World pvp while farming and leveling.
---
This dude gets it
---
TBC was more based on WC3 than vanilla in terms of endgame content: Vashj, KT, Archimonde, Illidan, Medivh's tower versus Ragnaros, C'Thun, Hakkar, Nefarian, etc. Sure you have Stratholme and Kel'Thuzad and many other WC3 references, but more of it was original than it was a continuation of WC3. (I like to call it original vs "pulled out of their ass"). A faction of undead calling themselves the Forsaken and joining the Horde (and being able to cast holy spells) is just as retconned as the draenei story. MoP is more pulled out of their ass than WoD since it like you said has only one existing character and a whole new made you continent never before heard in the lore and a whole new set of gods, compared to WoD which explored tons of familiar orcs and a familiar planet - time travel crap was some BS but time travel was something we had seen before in the game
---
Eye of divinity was also added in 1.4 (honor patch)
---
Aw my bad thought we were still talking about priest - warrior is def the hardest
---
Thank you for your example, that helps a lot. Seems like match up knowledge and fight experience is going to be a major factor. Is there a place that you recommend for hunter information?
---
Thanks for your comments!
---
main reason to log in day 1 is to secure the names you want, playing is secondary for me tbh given the assumption that launch will be nuts
---
You can get away with 30/0/21 in a casual guild tbh, most won't care if you're not dropping mana tides
---
Druids are a jack of all trades kinda class, if they were 1. in each of their roles, healing, dps, tanking the class would be overpowered.
---
A resto druid in raids might have limitations over priest and pallies but provide the raid with other great tools.
---
If you're looking to go Alliance, Unity is an Australian and New Zealand guild that is aiming to do both PvE and PvP. Come pop by the Discord of you're interested. 
---
https://discord.gg/TWnNpEs
---
They also pulled the Forsaken faction out of their asses so some of this retconning isn't all poorly received
---
warriors, countered by frost mages, everything else i beat. 
---
humans engineering and gear go a long way
---
Warriors because the gear is super expensive/very hard to get. 
---
I'd play warrior only as main.
---
&gt;Warlock, Paranoia to help find stealth, SL to make you have more effective health than anything else in the game on top of **40% damage reduction before armor**, dots to break stealth, aoe to break stealth, at least fear has a short range and locks out their shadow school
---
Hold on just a sec. You bring up some good points but you can't call soul link damage reduction. That's just not correct. It's an increase to their health pool, but it doesn't reduce damage.
---
Also, they only get the 10% physical DR from MD if they roll with the VW. Most locks in PVP would have the felhunter out and get added magical resistance(so that sucks for mages, not rogues).
---
So that's 0% damage reduction before armor.
---
Is this the start of the Jimmy Story?
---
if its gated by mc it sort of should be in a 1.12 build
---
i forget if it was a 100% drop in mc , either way each raid can give it to 1 priest per week max so it should take months for a good number of priests on a server to have it.
---
between what raids was it put in , i guess they could enable it at a later phase 
---
i assume this will be tied with the bow too
---
Paladin, because it’s the most boring, stale, easy to play class. 
---
Next is Druid, because there are so many cool unique classes that are balanced in different ways, why play the most gimped hybrid in the time when the hybrid tax is the highest and they have the least to offer in pvp, and get amazing in BC. (I would level one in BC)
---
There are ways to clear SOME of the dot effects. Dwarf racial makes you immune to poison and bleeding effects, also Luffa trinket takes one bleeding effect off you. Other than that, if you have a dot on you, you must live with it. I.e when in a duel or in 1v1 situation, try to blind/sap when the dot is about to end to get a full resetealth.
---
Does anybody know what this guy is talking about?
---
Problem is that getting 40 people is a bit difficult for some guilds. That's where hybrid specs like HoTW shine. A HoTW druid is prepared to off-tank, hold second threat, dps, and heal/decurse at any given moment and is prepared with multiple gear sets for each situation. For a guild that struggles with attendance, having a HoTW druid that is on time and willing to give 110% is invaluable.
---
In a more serious guild though, I 100% agree you should just go deep feral if that's the role you want to fill.
---
Thanks I'll have to check it out
---
Resto shaman.  Resto shaman.
---
Shaman has always been the class I end up coming back to, and that's largely because it was my first raiding character back in Vanilla.  I did get out of the habit of healing once I stopped playing so regularly and ran mostly guileless for multiple expansions, because the game moved on and expectations changed.  But I fully intend to Chain Heal my way to glory once again when Classic ships.
---
Think I might go tauren this time around, even though the consensus is that they are mechanically weaker than the other options.
---
It was already a disaster for 3 expansions going into Legion with or without spaceships
---
This kills the crab
---
What exactly is out there? I thought it's a faction that you controlled during wc3 TFT lead by Sylvanas.
---
I think the issue is that flex raiding ensures that guilds don't really need to invite members outside of them (Unless they just need to fill a slot), and if they do/want to, all they have to do is host their group on LFG and they can immediately pick up whoever they need.
---
Socializing is harder in modern WoW, and I say that as someone who does socialize and tries to make friends with the people I pug with. The game is *much* faster paced, which leaves less opportunity to just...talk. How many people did you meet in vanilla after grouping with them,because you could have entire conversations *just on the way to the dungeon*? And chatter between pulls while the healer drinks? Or even in-combat, since so many classes had slow, simple rotations that you could chatter during? That kind of stuff is missing from retail, where downtime is nonexistant.
---
Cool cool, well i see your point, me personally i just dont like the idea of being delayed to get to 60, i do however like the wpvp at max level (vs equal level opponents)
---
I had written up a reply to a post I guess you deleted but I'll post my response to this comment anyway since it addresses your edit...
---
A cat would be using his mana to power shift, he cannot throw heals.  Even if he tries, his mana pool allows for at most 4 total casts before he's out, if he started at 100%.
---
Warlocks have utility for the group too, they summon people, give imp buff, and healthstones.  They're also commonly used to tank an encounter in AQ40.
---
Mages conjure food and water for the raid, make portals, and do immense aoe damage.
---
Rogue utility is a bit lower, but they're important for a lot of bosses for interrupts, and can even evasion tank a boss for a bit when necessary (and this DOES happen).
---
Hunter utility is also a bit low, but they can perform some kiting maneuvers, pulling, and traps to help control adds.
---
Druid can do none of those things, even if you could put out 100% the same amount of DPS as those classes there is still a reason to bring them.  Druid utility for the raid basically consists of innervating the priests.
---
Also, if you spend 3 talent points into improved sap (21/8/22 build, hemo build) then sap doesn't take you out of stealth.
---
Seconding the ISBoxer recommendation, excellent program for multiboxing, no TOS violation as it doesnt automate any of your gameplay, only downside is that iirc you need to pay for a license to get the most out of it, but it's not terribly expensive
---
/moo
---
Just will not work out like you envision. I am going Druid(or mage) and would love for a little boost. I can not see it happening without big consequences.
---
Fuck that, call me Tour Guide.
---
I patiently tank for newbs and give descriptions of boss fights, pointers on the subtle distiction of playing their class in a group, as opposed to the solo rotations they may be used to.
---
I’ll give advice on why some items should be deferred to particular classes. When to need, when to greed, and why.
---
These Tourists can be converted to fresh blood for our servers, but only if we treat them well.
---
&gt; 9
---
Hey this sounds right up my alley! Would love to connect with you guys... Planning on rolling warlock. I mained a Resto shaman from Vanilla - Cataclysm, had some server first kills and heroic kills. Looking to raid semi-hardcore around my schedule (which is very busy), but still want to contribute! HMU!!
---
&gt; Leveling is super slow. You won't die, but your dps is shit. Even with shield slam fully buffed, it's just painful.
---
You're supposed to level at fury and just put a shield on for dungeons...
---
Untill you took literally less than 15 minutes to do ANY research at all and figured out how much students loans and housing(especially in certain states) actually costs, then add on food, the 3 major insurances, and then maybe try to add in a function to not spend your entire "living" wage on just barely scraping by. You can also try a basic model of time spent during the day, and when you add up just a single job(+commute) + sleep, you only have ~30% of your day left. How do you spend those 9 hours? A decent amount was probably getting ready for work, maybe caring for kids, or fucking eating food. Soon, just after the most basic of necessities you barely have a 5th of your day left.
---
Ever think people may also actually not mind living with their parents, possibly wanting to spend more time with them before they kick the bucket, to help out for all the shit they did for them as a kid? Maybe if you all weren't so concieted and selfish you might have been able to develop a sense of empathy before becoming whining man babies yelling at suffering, extorted people, just fighting for scraps.
---
How about you all get this "kiddy safe space" crap out of your viles heads and treat people with basic respect and decency? Is that too fucking hard to comprehend?
---
Maybe put the bit where you tell people to get aimed shot first while levelling at the start, so they don't have to read so much before realising there's no point reading this.
---
I mean, hell, it's almost like people once played MMO games for something other than watching numbers go up. For me the community was always the main draw.
---
The quest loot from majordomo was added with the world boss patch
---
 you get one eye from the chest in MC off of majordomo which is the second last boss which is a trinket called the eye of divinity, which can be rightclicked and it basically clues you to go to eastern plagye lands
---
You get the other from kazzak (~80%) or atleast a very high chance without it being a guarantee. If you dont have a guild thats contending in wbosses then you can still go to blasted lands and farm the demons around kazzak spawn or the demons in the very southern point of winterspring which is a trinket called the eye of shadow.
---
You equip the eye of shadow and now an npc becomes visible to you that has a quest that you must do solo, im not going to explain the quest itself butbit gives you an item called the splinter of nodrissil wich you combine the eye of divinity with to make your staff
---
I smell sarcasm, but I'm taking it as a compliment whether you like it or not.
---
The LFG system existed before 3.3, although it wasn't the same system. Before 3.3, the LFG system was more like the system currently used on retail for m+ - you selected a dungeon from a dropdown menu, and you could start a group, or see a list of people LFG so you could whisper them. 
---
I suspect that's what he meant.
---
Paladin, Shaman, Druid. I spent my first go through being frustrated with being a jack of all trades, master of none. PRIEST MAGE OR WAR LOL.
---
Has it been confirmed that servers won't have any of the current cross realm and dungeon finder type tools? Looking forward to having to socialize and talk with your dungeon group and knowing people on server. Really feel like LFD killed the truly social aspect of the game
---
Peon logs tihi
---
Ahhhhh I remember doing this quest and finally getting Benediction. Felt like a legendary weapon tbh
---
You can Intercept in combat though.
---
Do you not care about the impact it would have on pvp? Meme specs would be absolutely unstoppable in pvp if they were balanced in pve
---
Yes that too :)
---
I want to see the nuts, just to experience it again :)
---
What about their change allowed that?  I feel like it had way more to do with people learning to play and getting access to better gear but that's not based on any hard evidence.
---
On top of that, at least during my vanilla raiding career most warriors weren't even fury spec, everyone thought warrior DPS was using high top end damage 2 handers (Ashkandi and Untamed Blade were the two most desired items back then... before AQ40).
---
Mage definitely does not need a boost.
---
Best class imo. Strong in every area.
---
Yeah, it became a crazy mess with time traveling, rewriting history, parallel timelines, etc. But seeing fucking space ships warping and starting the orbital bombardment made me feel like I am playing EvE online, not a WoW.
---
TLDR version available?
---
I have a 60 prot war, fury war, Hunter and warlock on several P servers. Stopped 2 months ago so i wouldnt be bored, and I dont have the same time to play anymore. But all this vanills hype is driving me mad. Im also gonna roll aly lock this time. All my 60's was on horde so i wonna try something new.
---
its ok some weirdos also still like bfa
---
Im aware of the old system, but it was by no means a convenient way of finding a group.  At that point you just spammed trade/guild because LFG was empty (at least on a medium pop server).  Thats why they changed it to be easier to use.
---
Wasn’t the demo available to only those that bought a Blizzcon pass?
---
&gt; Don't play a paladin, it sucks to be the best healing class in the game with insanely good buffs, **the only magic dispel other than priests**, fastest most mana efficient heal in the game, instant full heal, two different immunities, and more armour than most warriors.
---
Warlocks have a magic dispel.
---
I would also consider Warriors a hybrid. They tank and they DPS. Druids tank and heal. The only hybrids that don't work are damage and healing hybrids. Those guys get stuck healing full time. (See: Paladins and Shaman.)
---
Thanks, will be checking this out. Absolutely loved your Priest guide you posted a long time ago.
---
Judging by the "Design Philosophy" they've talked about in the past, the answer is no. They've outright stated that they're treating the 1.12 data as sacrosanct, and they're not going to touch it to make the game feel better for modern players. They are explicitly aiming for an authentic recreation of (what they consider) the Vanilla WoW experience, even if that experience was influenced by things like poor game design, technical limitations, balance issues, etc. Hell, the stated reason for reverting back to the 16 Debuff limit is to preserve the game's balance as it was in 1.12.
---
So, as someone that loves playing weird, experimental and offbeat specs... no. Unless there's a serious shift in their philosophy, they're not touching it.
---
Why do you want to get a melee off of you when you have 30 points in Feral? Melee range is good for you. It's how you deal damage.
---
If you absolutely need to (i.e. You're running a flag in WSG and you need to peel the Rogue off of you so that you can cap), then you have Nature's Swiftness.
---
I suppose from a math point, arcane missles i believe is 20% of spell damage = damage, so every 3 seconds your firing 3 which = 60% spell damage in comparison to frostbolt or fireball which is 100% every 3 seconds.
---
If Arcane missles was re-balanced to have 33% of arcane damage instead, it would scale the same as fireball. Correct me if i'm wrong on the former numbers of fireball/frostbolt arcane missles % scale.
---
&gt;Don't play mage. You'll break your 1 key.
---
No I won't. I always map frostbolt to the 2 key.
---
Wow, thats actually more than i thought.  I think the only times i went there when i started (Wrath) was for gathering.
---
Well isn’t a huge reason Paladin tanks are tough to play because they have no taunt? Would it be so bad to give them a taunt or even make them spend a talent point in their Protection tree? That has absolutely zero effect on PvP. 
---
Druids I’m not sure what their issue is. I think it’s the lack of gear. If that’s the case, then done right, PvP gear will still be superior for PvP and druids could get better tanking PvE gear. 
---
But this goes against everything for the No changes crowd.
---
The eyes are the same lifeless eyes in everyone. (Yes the colours are different bit that's it)
---
Yes, the population couldn't have been even 1/100 of what the launch day population is gonna be
---
It might have just depended on the server you were on. Looking for non-heroic (especially looking for leveling dungeons) was impossible, but I didn't have any trouble forming heroic groups with it basically instantly as a tank. That said, I believe I was on US-Shadow Council at the time - I'm not sure if that was a medium-pop, although it def wasn't a full server.
---
that's very interesting. I did not know this.
---
Yes, one pandaren, I said that.
---
Yes, confirmed will not be in classic during last years blizzcon
---

Please release early July!  I'm a teacher pff for the summer....

If you see a hunter wearing hoj assume hes an idiot.

Took me too long to realize this wasn’t some weird date lol
---
Tips... so annoying. /squelch
---
Here's a great guide from 1-60 made by the world record vanilla speedrunner, Joana. He leveled a hunter to 60 in 4 days 20hrs /played. (He even has the entire speedrun on YouTube btw, pretty cool) 
---
https://www.joanasworld.com
---
It's currently geared towards horde but he is releasing the alliance side guide before classic comes out.
---
Pair this guide with the questie add-on and you'll be set :)
---
I got one vanilla screenshot left. Its with my 56 gnome warrior using IBS hitting a t2 rogue for 917 MS. I will keep it forever.
---
I feel the same way. Played Warlock in classic (and really only class I have played in all versions). So I am kind of sick of warlock. But also back then I really hate a shit talent setup for both pve &amp; pvp and idk.... I really do like the class. I am too afraid to try healing or tanking so think I am stuck with dps. I was really thinking Rogue but.... idk how much I want to raid as a rogue i like being ranged dps. 
---
Keep thinking of just going Lock again but fuckkkk want to change it up also lol. I would mage but think my buddy going to. I could too I suppose. No desire to play hunter. Would maybe go druid but gearing it out sounds annoying plus I hate NE starting spot haha.
---
I know, but its the only thing I have... If you know something better to use please let me know!
---
Serious Sam, is that you?
---
2hand fury is harder but dont go around fooling anyone its useless in pvp.
---
No it wont
---
They’re using real data, i.e. comparing the numbers/algorithms/mathemtical formulae side by side. So I can’t imagine it being more precise than that!
---
Same, I look forward to enjoying leveling like I did back in BC. People say the hype will die down 2 months in but I wont even be max level by that time! lol
---
Wait what's salvation, I forgot?
---
For context, I want to mention that I currently am heavily involved with raid comps for two separate horde side guilds on AQ patch with Naxx around the corner.  In one raid we run a feral and 2 rdruids, in the other we are full tryhard and run only one rdruid, no others.  It's nice to have more rebirth, but druids in a tryhard raid exist for faerie fire &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; everything else.  Everything you've described, to me, boils down to a rare instance where a healer may pull healer aggro, and the rdruid is somehow more likely to be nearby and can snap to bear and tank that mob up.  Works great, except a tryhard resto is already running a few armor consumes and has no problem doing that fully resto spec'd in full resto gear.  The aura also doesn't add more damage for the raid than another fury, same argument as boomkin aura and another mage.
---
Meanwhile on Alliance side..

You want nostalgic? BTPB, Jenkins, Drakedog, Radagast, Onyxia Wipe, The Internet is for Porn, etc

True that, my personal focus was more towards Undead... So I only put the numbers of the other factions in just to have a complete picture. Thanks for mentioning!
---
Let‘s annoy the new kids in town with this old grandpa music!

Without a 12 button MMO mouse you will find yourself using control + numbers and alt+ numbers for additional bindings.
---
Corsair Scimitar is my go to mouse.
---
Thats prob true, but i see kings as really good blessing so part of me wants that, but can't have everything.
---
That looks awesome in every possible way. What a nostalgia trip!!
---
Paladin tanking problems are so much deeper than taunt, the details of that topic have been gone over to death on these forums.
---
Campfires. My only proper way to react when you see a Moonkin in classic.
---
When they start to ask questions why you keep on following them you link them a Roasted Quali and point towards your pet.
---
Works every time to freak them out :3
---
Horde in Vanilla, did the alliance thing on a private server, felt dirty, returned to the Horde. 
---
Alliance looks shiny, but brings in the derps.
---
Horde looks badass, but brings in the dregs.
---
The worst part is, the "S.E.L.F.I.E Stick" was literally the main feature of the first content patch in Warlords of Draenor (6.1). No raid tier, no new quest chains, just the selfie stick.
---
1dps enhance happens especially with the weapon nightfall.  You'll never be top dps, but can do respectable on some fights and the improved totems will boost a melee group enough to be worthwhile
---
Isn't regrowth broken on private servers?
---
Does anyone remember WSG items that were useful for running flags? 
---
Obviously Rogue prep with double Sprint was popular, Skull of Impending Doom and I swear there were other trinkets or items? Rocket boots I remember being very popular in arena but I don't remember if that was a thing in classic.
---
if he doesn't like bear talking then he should be fine as long as he avoids druids.
---
You're in for a big disappointment then if you think Hunters won't roll for it. HoJ is bis until phase 2 when Dire Maul comes out.
---
In order to make paladins a viable or even optimal tank you would need :
---
-Items that gave mana AND defense
---
-An ability to mitigate damage since BoP drops your aggro for when bosses do some sort if rage mechanic/nuke
---
-better single target damage to keep threat.
---
I WILL say paladin tanks are my favourite 5 man tank since they have consecrate which makes my job as a healer a lot easier since he doesnt have to tab target each mob and hit it once so it doesnt come after me when i cast my first heal
---
I mean, I browse r/classicwow for, like, two hours everyday so I guess you could say things are gettin' pretty serious.
---
Posts from 2006 say that sitting only proceed effects of the attack was an ability and not an auto attack. Blizzard claims to be using the 1.12 backup code so it should work the same way.

&gt;main reason to log in day 1 is to secure the names you want,

Who can type in "Sephiroth" faster than anyone else? Or "Sephiiroth" or "Sephirooth", ok maybe "Legoooolaaaas", "Legoland"?... :D
---
Malagus needs to take off his rose-colored glasses for a minute. Blizzard **may** have worked hard to balance all classes for pvp and pve in vanilla, but they didn't succeed... at all.
---
Thanks for the reply. However, the calculation does already include all the reputation you gain from the starter zones. It also takes in consideration that you are going to complete all the quests before they turn grey. However, the numbers are based on what I can get from the DB. I did a lot of research but I was never able to find something with detail.
---
Your statement with reaching exalted around level 47 is probably based on this video here: [https://youtu.be/n\_yhrHCPeFo](https://youtu.be/n_yhrHCPeFo). Not sure if he tested it himself and we also don't know where. His statements are all based on the same DB values I used, so based on the quest reputation they fit. However, he says also: "Every time you complete a quest for a Horde quest giver, not only do you get reputation with the quest givers faction, you also get 1/4 th of that base reputation value given to all other Horde factions". Not sure where this is comming from... I tried in the fresh release of ND (private server) to do exactly this, do as Undead all the Darkspear reputation quests.
---
So the char (currently at level 37 cause I stopped playing that one) is at the moment Honored with 3.950 / 12.000. And I did all the quests until this level which give Darkspear reputation before they went grey! I only missed 2-3 quests at the starting zone in Durotar. According to the DB I should be on 5.745 / 12.000. I obviously did also all the other normal quests... However, I gained only reputation from quests which give (according to the DB) Darkspear reputation. So the statement from the video does not fit to ND at least. I also did some double check on my PTR and I tested some quests and non of these gave Darkspear reputation if it wasn't directly mentioned in the DB.
---
The guide you linked is also not very helpful, what it says is do all the Darkspear reputation quests (which we already know) and also try to donate as much cloth as you can.
---
Sssssh don't tell my opponents this
---
That's right, it was BM focused. Was there a legit BM spec before burning crusade?
---
The rotation is also very hard to learn far as maximizing DPS. IIRC, I believe you need to powershift right as you are about to get a tick of energy, or is it right *after* you get it? One of these. Timing is very important.
---
THIS.
---
Nobody knows... What you are describing did however work on private servers...
---
I will be greatly entertained
---
The first time it's truly unexpected, and it's wrongly attributed
---
Dude I walked to ironforge at level 10 maybe to play with my friend... took I think all day and I died countless times lololol. A week later I learned of the fabled “deep run tram” my trips between major city’s and leveling my weapon skills were never the same
---
Depends, the mail helmet from Herod is good for warriors even past 40, but if your tanking yes armor is important, southsea headbucket would be a good replacement for tanking. A full set of mail vs a full set of plate will make a huge difference in physical damage reduction.  Like you said its not nearly as important for hunters.
---
With no cross server play those people that make it to 60 like this will likely get ostracized pretty quickly. But you’re best bet for having a good time in Classic is to find a guild or an alliance of guilds and only play with members.
---
Most raiding guilds are going to have 8-10 warriors on staff a feral Druid probably and a bunch of healers. Make friends and run with them.
---
This meme template gets me every time
---
Bare in mind that regrowth gets double the value on private servers as you get both +heal from the hots &amp; the direct heal. You wouldn't be topping your charts if the game still played as it did. 
---
In a realistic setting a pala/priest who is playing to a high level will always out perform a druid whose playing to an equal level in terms of healing output.
---
Pretty sure they play that in a few zones, not just the barrens.  I could be mistaken though.
---
why not respecc a single time when you hit 60 and made a bit gold?
---
Is there a confirmed release date yet? Or is "Summer 2019" still all we've got?
---
Never used anything past the 4 key and was kiting with one hand.

When you keep the e key as strafe you can even kite in a circle and always face your opponent.

While it's a private server example, we had a feral druid go all out cat DPS and he was able to put up record breaking parses on many fights...  [https://legacyplayers.com/Armory/?charid=338852](https://legacyplayers.com/Armory/?charid=338852)
---
I tamed him at 60 and never had the patience to level him up...
---
First time I've seen this, thank you!
---
AND MY AXE
---
I'm not saying "replace your Fury Warriors with hybrid Druids." I'm saying that your healing Druids can tank instead of the Fury Warriors, which allows the Warriors to continue to top the damage meters at the expense of one of your average healers (as you put it).
---
That should be a net gain, right? Sacrificing one of your weaker healers to off-tank duty, rather than sacrificing your top DPS?
---
You could also make your kids play with you. Me and my wife played vanilla and now have an 11 and 10 year old that will be playing classic with us.
---
Agreed. This is the one song that practically brings me to tears from the nostalgia and fond memories
---
Shouldnt make fun of people with mental illness, stockholm syndrome is real.
---
Except you are left handed like me.
---
Nagas are no longer produced for lefties.
---
Teldrassil is what got me hooked so I'm biased 😅
---
Yeah honestly who buys a blizzcon ticket? It's overpriced af and you get practically nothing.
---
This sounds like private server cancer where people don’t care about their reputation/characters.
---
I feel you, kids work/uni.. still having played only a pve server in vanilla .. i feel like trying out a pvp 😅 But knowing that i only have a few hours each night not sure how bad are the gank fests on pvp servers 😂
---
See for yourself: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWQ6ucy-QEk
---
It's listed as 40% chance to drop, so worst cast scenario you get 2 per hour? This is assuming the rule is still 5 instance resets per hour. I will be farming myself just for the Lols, probably won't feral DPS myself, but if I ever decide to, I'll have a supply of these maces ready.
---
Sounds like a Mario quote
---
I did this .. the day before our first ony raid..
---
MoP was god-tier, fun story, amazing class design, beautiful visuals.
---
Truly the Renaissance of WoW post TBC, dont @ me
---
Everyone is afraid to step out of their comfort zone. I've done all three roles before, and I can tell you, tanking and healing will make you a better DPS'er, better player, and stepping outside your comfort zone will make you a better person in general :)
---
Yeah, but you get to experience the disappointment of Diablo Immortal 10 minutes before it's the front page post on reddit!
---
As a tauren female main, sorry but id take the new look ANY day. Just give a toggle option to make us both happy.
---
Suffered so bad that they remained the most invited class to MC.
---
The slate should be wiped clean with a WoW2 that takes into account lessons learned from retail's mistakes and Classic's successes
---
I saw this in raids often on pservers. This is why it's very important to get in a guild that you know meshes well with your personality. You can't control who runs the guild unless you run it yourself, but you don't have to endure the very vocal and insulting type of raid leader (I've heard my few).
---
For dungeons? I've rarely seen issues on pservers. Granted, pservers have their own meta and a very large, experienced core audience. The influx of retail and newer players to Classic will very likely see a culture clash with the new meta.
---
The absolute best answer to any of your issues (and issues we all share) is your choice in guild or how you choose to run your guild. Class officers are highly beneficial. Players get to learn how to play their class role while leveling and prepping for raids when approaching 60, instructed by experienced players. 
---
Just note that pre-made progressive guilds often do not have the patience for this and only wish to recruit experienced players. This likely means recent experience on pservers and not ancient retail vanilla experience. This likely will include even full experience in obtaining pre-BIS and they don't want to have to teach you that either. So find the right guild for you, and don't pretend to know more than you do to get into progression guilds shooting for world/server firsts. 
---
Friendly guild runs, set at the pace of the experience of the players, will help weed out terrible pug or speed runs if one wishes to avoid the bulk of the common negative experiences within more socially cooperative games.
---
Just my experience anyway.
---
was expecting Drowning Pool-Bodies
---
What he mentioned occurred on retail than on pservers. Don't assume or believe BS memes.
---
I hate the Razer mouse with the small ass buttons. I'm going to have to purchase one with larger buttons on the side.
---
There is no meme spec in vanilla. There is meme specs in reddit thread or forums. Just play what you like, I would not care someone in my raid being a shadow priest or a boomkin. Most raids are 40 man, we have done them one billion times, I think guild can handle doing them with few guys not using optimal spec. Plus some specs will probably be more tolerated in general because of classic increased debuff slots. But honestly we do not need any rebalance things, most raid content will get facerolled and the 'race' is in fact over since 15 years now. Lets just get the most fun times you can with whatever class/spec you like. You will make friends, have some great times and laughts, that is what you will remember in years, not that you were 300 dps behind an 'optimal' pve spec.
---
Thanks! I'll be sure to go as enhance then.
---
Personally the only one that bothers me is auction house addons that affect people who don’t use auction house addons. And by that I mean listing 50+ pages of 1 stack of linen cloth because they sell higher that way.
---
They were in Vanilla, don't see why not have them. At the same time, I don't plan to use any. Don't wan't a big red arrow telling me where to go or something using my abilities for me. Maybe something to give more detail in in the raid frames.
---
You guys are ridiculous.  Grim was awesome.  It's not like today ppl are better it's just a different game.
---
Nah they're not old enough for dungeons. Make them grind slaves.
---
The forsaken joining the horde isn't a retcon. They aren't changing pre-existing lore, they are just adding onto it. Like, it happened between WC3 and WoW. Also, a faction of undead calling themselves the forsaken happened in WC3. When Sylvannas takes Lorderon in WC3 she literally states that her people are here on out called the Forsaken.
---
This is a great outlook!
---
HEY MA, I'M A LUMBERJACK
---
Can anyone make a web page where you were here a song and have to guess a lot of someone that goes with it? It would be fun.
---
Druid healing is actually really good. The problem they have is their HoTs don't stack. Which means most guilds don't bring more then two, three as a max to any serious raid. They also suffer in fights were the raid isn't taking much damage. The problem is, if you put a HoT on a target then a priest heals it to full, it totally wrecks ur effective healing.
---
However any fight were the raid (or Melee for example) is constantly taking damage is were they really shine. Golemagg is a good example, melee get a stacking damage debuff the longer they beat on the boss. Your hots are incredibly valuable here because there will be a lot of people who only need small long duration heals (what a druid does best)
---
That’s kinda funny tbh
---
Activision Blizzard would never commit to the project of this size, it's "too risky" Project Titan was the last chance.
---
Maybe ally side. Its definitely not bis horde side. Rune of the guard captain and black hands breath are definitely better. I guess its bis pre diremaul trinket never played FRESH ally side.
---
That’s stupid of them
---
I used Addons in vanilla so I guess I'll use them again
---
Would HotW ns be good  enough for tanking 5m dungeons?
---
RotGC is sadly Horde only yeah
---
One will spam Heal and the other will spam taunt.😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
---
For PvE, absolutely. But for PvP, playing mage is an art. Distance, level of spells, split second decisions, beautiful kiting, it’s a lot of fun and not boring in the slightest.
---
Mop was pretty good or so ive heard
---
Definitely rolling HOTW spec myself - will raid as heals and then be ready for sweet sweet wpvp/bgs, cannot wait &lt;3
---
Ah yes, the true masterrace
---
Is it really unexpected to use a quote from the game this meme is from? But yeah, definitely not thanos lol
---
Vendor the loot. I think you just kill 3 or so bosses in the Princess area. Tinkerer, Princess, and Rotgut. 
---
DM  Tribute Runs you actually get the loot from the final boss if I understand correctly. It's a chest on the ground you loot instead of having to kill him, so you do some tricky trick with the pet and FD and loot the chest.
---
Mages would also farm DM, but they would farm the low level plant elementals for greys, as opposed to getting the loot from the final boss. 
---
What makes them special? The Tribute can be looted w/o killing the boss, or any mobs for that matter I think. The Maraudon run you can just teleport in using the Staff from the quest. Teleports you towards the 'back' of the dungeon near the 3 bosses you want to kill.
---
Currently reading fellowship for the first time in 20 years and it's excellent.
---
Those with great experience with can provide specifics but:
---
1. Pricey vendor trash
---
2. Tons of rares to disenchant (a prime target for many mages)
---
3. Selling pre-BIS runs
---
4. Best chances at pricey BoE items.
---
I played WoD for most of its entirety and that expansion fucking sucked hard right until the end. The only good thing that came out of it was BRF.
---
Was it in vanilla?
---
I'll be ok with new players. My slurs will be towards the private server baby min maxers who think they know shit about azeroth...meanwhile I entered at launch when they just got done potty training. Fuckin privys
---
My fiancé is playing with me this time, leveling Warrior is going to be a new experience with pocket heals!
---
The Thanos part was unexpected
---
Again, this is part of the confusion behind TBC: Lady Vashj is the handmaiden of Azshara... which is also part of the confusion behind why SSC is in outlands - she would never be separated from Azshara by choice!
---
Absolutely nothing beats the classic human melee animations. Especially dual wielding.
---
Rexxar is not little
---
Paladin...yet I’m gonna main one. Just gonna rush the leveling process. Rip the band aid off fast as it were.
---
As ridiculous as it sounds, a company that huge shying away from a huge project, you do seem right. When that company's big announcement was a damn mobile game instead of the sequel for a game that came out 10 years ago. Seriously, what is Blizzard's next big project going to be? Likely still Diablo 4 but other than that is there any indication they'll be releasing a significantly new game?
---
How uncommon are female Orcs?
---
Goblin rocket boots, Nifty Stopwatch, Free Action Potions. Noggenfogger and World Enlarger trinket to make yourself small and hard to click.
---
Yes, 21st June!
---
Not really in a somewhat serious guild. Pet pathing wasn’t the greatest, and issues with AoE were always a problem. If you’re in a guild that doesn’t really go full tryhard, or maybe look at meters, then maybe a BM spec would be fine. Issues arise when you’re trying to advance content- the hunter, outside of really just Tranq Shot and MAYBE some useful slow traps on Gluth, is just not able to carry weight. Add in Hunter’s mark AND T2 8pc proc debuff (which only benefits hunters), you’re bringing a class that isn’t carrying their weight in damage. 
---
Trueshot is almost mandatory. If you can somehow eclipse the additional 400 AP through a survival (lightning reflexes build), then maybe the guild would accept you swapping. 
---
Many guilds that I recall used hunters primarily as ranged soak in Huhuran with AotW. Damage was pure shit and were just shit support characters in there. 
---
Thaddius in Naxx would chain off pets and wipe raids. They didnt follow your debuff and were treasured as their own unit. 
---
Source: was a hunter tryhard in vanilla and TBC.
---
Shareholder dependancy, nothing else.
---
That’s partly what I was getting at - Vashj and Azshara should never have been separated, much less in Outlands, randomly with the demons vs. with the old gods...
---
Fair? That's downright gorgeous
---
It was well established that Chen was not the only Pandaren.
---
Holy/Prot is a godly PVP spec but only once you get a good 2h and some gear.  It's still a good PVP healing/support spec without gear but you'll never really kill anyone unless you get a decent 2h and can use some reck bombs. 
---
Holy/ret is much stronger in open world grinding because of seal of command, vengeance, and the other damage boosting talents.  It's still decent at PVP but reck bombs, BOK, the shorter hammer and BOP cooldown , improved conc aura and toughness are all nice PVP talents.  The ret tree only really boosts damage, not PVP utility, so you might find yourself not being able survive nearly as well but those vengeance crits can be nice =P
---
Not really clear if you mean at level 60 or while leveling either, I'm only speaking about once you're 60
---
Don't know where you're from but here the state will look after you in those circumstances.
---
Watch some Chapelle Show and order mozz sticks and a large pizza then pretend you have to hide somewhere to smoke a bowl before your parents/roommates catch you.

I have the Corsair Scimitar and like it very much. As long as your thumbs are bible and small enough to hit the individual buttons. I don’t use all 12 though, probably 6 of them and the rest on keyboard.

I have found it very nice for Druid with all the form changing and utility spells.

I gave my account to a friend mid burning crusade.. the expansion was decent but the end of faction rivalry, major raids and the vast feeling of the world's ended it for me. I logged in like a month after vanilla release. This will be my first time logging back in and planning to play.
---
Part of the class identity of Warrior, Rogue, Mage and Priest is that they are the best classes for most PvP and Raid scenarios. Other classes attract players for different reasons, they have more dimensions to them - Hunter and Warlock have pets, Shaman and Paladin have faction uniqueness, and Druid has flexibility. 
---
IMO the best way to balance the game is to accept that some classes/builds are the strongest and that's fine as long as players are having fun. 
---
Maybe Blizz could add some difficult duos content that's only really beatable if one of the players in the team is a hybrid build.
---
Ask Jeeves for some oc wow.
---
Bless, I remember the stopwatch.
---
Its obviously a matter of perspective, and for me addons makes the game more enjoyable. I understand why some people are against them but as long as we aren't getting the old API back and the current APIs will be restricted, I don't see how addons could affect the game negatively in any way.
---
&gt; The Tribute can be looted w/o killing the boss
---
lol my buddy in classic got banned for kicking gnomes and calling them midgets.
---
/r/wowcringe
---
This is what was the start of wows decline, trying to make every spec viable for pve which led to class homogenization.  Why play a priest when a Druid can heal just as well. Or a warrior, mage, or rogue for that matter.  Just make everyone a Druid.      
---
The philosophy of vanilla was being the class AND the player
---
If you want to seriously raid you will be expected to be a certain spec.  If you dont want to be a buff bot don’t roll a pali.  Any serious raid guild in vanilla did not run shadow priests.  Their damage was crap.  No arc mages.  You cant depend on procs to keep you from oom.  No feral druids or space chickens.  Play how you want to play but realize that if you want serious raiding you will have to play a certain way or else be like the majority of people from vanilla.  Either never having raided or barely finishing mc after everything was nerfed to hell and back.
---
Just don't be a lefty!
---
That's the point. Nearly everyone NOT complaining about leveling and ganking, already leveled, obtained pre-BIS and are raiding to get even better gear ... all during the patch with no honor system in place.
---
These are called easy mode levelers. They know, and fully exploit the least pvp active moments on the server. Try entering a pvp server around AQ or later and see how easy it is to level as a fresh character with no 60's or infinite gold to twink their alt. It's an entirely different experience.
---

This. Youre all gonna be the same faction on a PvP server. Boost your people up and trash alliance...
---
We were all new to azeroth 14 or so years ago
---
Ah cool, I actually missed WoD and Legion completely, was going off forum posts (not the best admittedly 😝)
---
This does relate to WoW classic.
---
As a Warrior am I better off being Orc or Undead?
---
They’re like a jack of all trades except instead of being semi decent at each role, they’re complete garbage at everything except healing.
---
So I don’t understand this meme, but am seeing it literally everywhere. What is it?
---
Put 13 points into Ret so you get the movement speed and SoC.  You'll still have enough left over to pick up Kings.
---
Forgot Drizzzzzzzzzzzzt.
---
Going Pally too. Personally, my favorite part of leveling and WoW in general is the dungeoning. I’m looking forward to level as ret, heal dungeons, and maybe even get the opportunity to tank a few, if I’m overleveled.
---
This video isn't really that relevant anymore now that we get to use modern api :P
---
Mana Tide Totem gives same mp5 as BoW Rank 1 you get at level 14 lmao Shamens on suicide watch

Just look at that soy grin
---
Most popular addons during vanilla were just adding quality of life that was missing from the default Blizzard UI. Not GPS, but things like:
---
* Equip Compare, which compared any item you hovered over to your currently equipped item. Blizzard UI had this only for quest rewards and in the AH
---
* mailing multiple items at once 
---
* target markers and ready checks
---
* auto flying (you could get banned for these but oh boy, did getting to places suck before the automatic connections were introduced)
---
Most of this is now integrated in the UI. There are also useful addons that remembered details about your twinks or class-specific info, like a druid's mana while he is in animal form.
---
I don't remember GPS add-ons being popular, but there were a lot of add-ons designed to remove gameplay from the game, like decursive and healbot. I understand both are around today but at the time they were borderline cheating, reducing healing in raids to literally one button. Those won't be possible with the modern add-on API, though no need to discuss them.
---
There's still place for many UI modifications . Some people like to tweak their UI or replace Blizzard's frames altogether. It wouldn't make much sense for Blizzard to introduce too many configuration possibilities when enthusiasts won't be pleased either way.
---
Some are okay. I'm not too fond on the ones that tell you what to do and when to do it in a raid. Kind of takes a bit of the skill away.
---
All around, Orc is better for weapon skill increase on axes and 25% chance to avoid stuns.  Undead are good for the Will of the Forsaken to break out of magical debuffs like fear and charm.
---
So Orc is great against rogues and has a slightly higher chance to hit, and undead are good fighting against locks.
---
There are more bonuses for each race but as far as I know these are your biggest selling points.
---
Leveling pets was part of the fun of playing Hunter ...
---
Not off the top of my head, good hunter info takes a bit of digging around. The best way to learn is experience it first hand!
---
I admire your restraint. If it turns out sharding is going to be more excessive than they planned, then I might take a knee for a week or two with you.
---
Times is money, friend!
---
I made sure to include classic versions as well. But yeah all the tips about Super Macro are a bit wasted :P
---
There is nothing wrong with the vast majority of addons.  They provide tools that people really wanted but weren't offered by the game.  People who think it turns wow into easy mode aren't obligated to use them, but I sure as hell will.
---
What’s a solid minimum tier gear for a priest to do the Benediction/Anathema quest chain?  I didn’t play Priest that far in Vanilla and want to this time around. I know I need Majordomo’s drop for the Eye, so I’m guessing Tier 0 with maybe a few Tier 1 trash drops might be enough?  I’ve heard the healing/cleansing quest is a royal pain in the ass, just curious how soon I could try and accomplish it without getting stomped.
---
I been here all summer
---
Hmm...Sounds like tourist speak to me
---
You sure sound precious for a 30 year old lol. He was obviously joking but some of you really need to grow a thick skin. As for edgelord children, the Alliance will probably have a younger audience because of the prettier races and the good guy persona. 
---
Just FYI, you're gonna be playing a MMORPG. If that comment offended you then you maybe stick to single player mode games.
---
I love the class fantasy... also the mad utility you bring to a 5-man. Sweet buffs, a stun, judgements, and you won’t die in 3 hits if you aggro. Plus I legitimately like having a ret Pally with repentance.
---
ITT: your favorite class being torn to shreds.
---
Learn the right way to play your class right being his subjective oppinion you should be weaving aimed shot in between autos while leveling. His gripes with beast mastery talents and something about tier gear for some reason.
---
Did I seem offended? That’s not the case.
---
You should do it that sounds awesome. Even just a stream of the chat would be worth it.
---
We're only here until Classic launches. Then I can finally swear off Reddit for good! (Again)
---
can't wait
---
I’m going to use addons. Hopefully they will bring the modern AH api in so TSM can work better and I can be rolling in gold eventually.
---

I sadly can't talk about PvP because i'm un experinced as hell in it.
---
But for raiding i can say, that Druid Heal, Druid Tank and Druid DPS(Feral) are viable. Balance Druid is playable, but not powerful by any means.
---
All 3 viable specs though, especially heal and i guess even tanks, will definitely be put in a raid group. For Feral DPS though.. many might still be unsure about, whether they are doing good DMG or not. So if u have the gear &amp; know how to play Feral DPS, u can convince ur raidlead and everyone else that it's definitely viable to pick u up.
---
I'm looking forward to do it, i already did it on a private Server, and i'm happy to do it again. Some people will actually be surprised how much DMG i can do even as a so considered "non-viable spec"
---
The private servers have some of the worst communities wow has to offer. I wouldn’t recommend it.
---
And I like you.
---
They're the jack of all trades but master of none.
---
I think a lot of people diss on Druid because they're the 'cheap' version of the real deal, like how people use to say "If you're a shadow Priest why not just be a Warlock".
---
The same thing applies to Druids, Cat form is the equivalent of being Rogue but none of the utility or poisons. 
---
That being said, anyone that says their healing was subpar in Vanilla never played.
---
I throughly enjoy the 2 hour 2v2 arena duel that turned into 1v1 Resto Druids which only ended because the other guy decided to leave a stalemate lmao
---
Orc for sure, Stun resist is fantastic in PvP because of how spikey damage is.
---
You are everything that is wrong with this sub. Hyper sensitive and thinking people are insulting you when they’re simply asking a question.

Hi, /u/markbbbm
---
I totally had a mage named frostitute
---
When playing on a p server every hour I would end up getting ganked at least once by either a low level or when I just got out of a fight vs a mob and at 10% health. That in my opinion is the gist of a pvp realm... and a “fair” fight never happens
---

I've seen loads of people claim there's no real difference since WoW has "always been cartoony", but my main gripe with the next art style is that it went from serious-comic-book cartoony to pixar-movie cartoony. It's a big change to me.

Classic Wowhead has Regrowth at "Heals a friendly target for (28.6% of Spell power) and another (49.7% of Spell power) over 21 sec."
---
I know that the coefficient would be different for both components.  Your OP made it sound like the hot wasn't supposed to get any +heal.
---
I knew what you meant when I saw your reply to me.
---
If you're a user experience person I wonder why you're making the classic mistake of throwing a wall a text at people (maybe you don't care how the post is received). If you don't get the convo you want out of this you might try resubmitting parts of it in chunks.   
---
I did read some of it, good insights from what I saw
---
&gt;This is basically the short version of how hunters earned the nickname huntard. A class that's easy to pick up with a skill ceiling beyond what most people understand.
---
And it came from those huntards that wanted to be special "pure melee hunters" because SV happened to have some enhanced melee talents LOL.
---
This intro is why I don't understand the people who play undead yet doesn't like Sylvanas anymore on retail. What part of that makes people think they were going to play nice with anyone?
---
Yeah, these I think are what most of the anti-add people dislike.  DPS meters and whispercast and shit existed back in 2005, those are fine.  But now there is an add-on that will almost automate a Hunters shot rotation and perfecting that was the biggest thing in separating good and bad hunters.   That definitely didn't exist in 2005.  If we are going to be consistent and expect no changes from blizzard then how can we be ok with add-ons that kind of sort of help you cheat that we didn't use back then.
---
&gt;Although warrior struggles if they don’t get the initial charge, admittedly.
---
Hunters have all the tools (and then some) to make sure the warrior doesn’t get the charge.

Initially, our focus as a guild will be leveling, experiencing the content and teaching the newbies all they need to progress. When a large enough number of us are ready, those who wish to do so will transition into raiding several nights a week. Those who don't are more than welcome to continue to enjoy the game however they choose.
---
**Rules:** Be excellent to each other and excersize common sense. We don't police language or humor, just be respectful. You're not required to be on at X time or X number of days per week. It's a game. If we have a movie night, you can come or not come. Your standing in the guild is based on your attitude in and out of game, not how many hours you've logged or how high your DPS is.
---
If you're interested in joining or have any concerns, don't hesitate to PM me directly here or DM me in Discord. I'm happy to answer any questions you may have.
---
**Discord:**

Hope you're using paypal and a random email/password. Site is infested with malware and is just a cashgrab.

The downside to rolling PvE realm is that if you change your mind about the random WPvP then you'll have to reroll (unless they make server change a thing on Classic), while on PvP realms @ 60 it's not that hard to avoid a fight if you don't want it with mounts etc.
---
If add-ons were in vanilla, they should be allowed in Classic.
---
Now some might argue that today's mod makers are far more skilled, and maybe LUA scripting has better features, or websites have more data from add-ons than vanilla times. That doesn't really matter though. You can't restrict a mod maker from Classic just because they gained scripting skills over the years, or that information websites work better. We're going in to Classic with knowledge of how to min-max in our brains, so there's no real way to prevent modern knowledge affecting the game.
---
I don't have a problem with having them if vanilla had them.
---
Bulgarian here. This dude you're talking about cannot have such a low salary. It's simply not possible. As someone else said already, the minimum wage is way higher than that.  
---
Go donate to charity instead.
---
The lore of Draenor was pre-established before WoW was even released in the warcraft games, so that's not true either.
---
I'm sure some people will tell you to get engineering after you reach level 60, but I think it's a lot more fun to level it as you level your character. Engineering is one of the easier professions to level as you level up it doesn't cost very much at all.

I'm so curious about how you couldn't find this mouse. When was it? Where do you live?

---
They're great late game healers in AQ and Naxx because of their insane healing efficiency. A bit underpowered during MC and BWL.
---
They're decent tanks and you could make a case for why they should MT certain fights. They're not your go-to MT class for every fight though.  
---
Cat is at least decent single target DPS but they lack any kind of AoE outside of Hurricane once every minute. Their DPS rotation is kind of wonky because of the constant shapeshifting. And you chug consumables like your life depends on it, it gets expensive to raid as a cat druid. It's extremely annoying to farm Manual Crowd Pummelers every week as Feral.
---
Balance *can* work in world PvP, but they don't even spec moonkin form. Balance PvE is so rare that I've only ever seen two or three actually try to pull it off as their main spec in my years on private servers. [Check out FinalFlash's balance video](https://youtu.be/vCvb8MwvsD4). If you're interested in PvP, FinalFlash also has clips of him playing Feral and Resto.
---
Lastly resto druids are gods of WSG. They're the best flag runners in the game bar none and a good flag carry druid is basically invaluable to a premade. If you're good at it you'll be among the most popular people on the server, at least among rankers.
---
If you ask me I'd say druids are underrated. They're legitimately useful in every stage of the game, even if they have some glaring weaknesses.
---
Reminds me of my first journey from Mulgore to org. Got big axe. Couldn’t use big axe. Google why. Need go to org. How get to org? Very far for lumpy Tauren. Remember buying lots of food (useless food). Got to org (after about an hour). Not enough money for train. Response to that? Quest in Durotar. Oooo! Big doggo for ride?! Must have.... but that’s a story for another time.
---
On the flip side Frosaken men spellcast animations are still sick as fuck, AND we get cool tongue physics!
---
It just flaps around and looks hilarious when casting.
---
Yeah you got a free month for a referral that subbed. RAF in WoW context is now always a reference to the 300% exp bonus though.
---
iirc it was a 50% drop chance (shared with the hunter item)
---
Takes 15 minutes to farm 2 to 3, each one has 3 uses. After 5 runs you're locked out of instances for an hour.

---
From a threat per second view pummelers are insane for Horde and can allow your raid to go ham on a boss, something a warrior can't pull off due to no Blessing of Salvation.
---
No way to fix it without hurting the integrity of the game just ignore it and drop the ban hammer
---
extra funny as I intend on doing a full rewatch of It's always sunny as I level.  I'm betting I finish the show before I hit 60
---
It being subjective is why I want the option to use classic or live models.
---
Also because everyone should see the glory of Forsaken tongue physics.
---
Did you know to learn charge rank 3 for boars you need bellygrub in redridge, or tame elite boars in razorfen(which is inconvenient because you are most likely there with a group and you cant bring out your stabled boar). There is no boar in the game with charge rank 4, so you are either stuck with charge rank  1, run up to loch modan for rank 2, or decide to take a daytrip to redridge and hopefully tame bellygrub. Rank 5 is at level 47, in blasted lands, so take this into consideration if you want a boar as your pet as horde.
---
I've been playing OSRS, FFXIV and Smite. Thinking of getting Risk of Rain 2 but dunno...
---
I've heard some say that they would take their 19 twinks out to various world PvP "hotspots" like Stranglethorn Vale and just brawl with people. But other than that, yes, WSG is the primary application. 
---
Personally, I find the Healer role to be very exhilarating in PvP, yet sometimes overwhelming at the higher levels (what with all the buttons to push). So level 19 is where I go when I want to focus on the action more. As an alt-oholic, It also lets me have more variety, because it takes so dang long to level up a single toon to 60 whereas I can have all 9 classes up to 19 in less time.
---
I've got larger than average male hands and the Logitech G600 is the perfect size for me.
---
Hunter: #1 tactical class to play in pvp.
---
If you like a high learning curve and built in class mechanics no other class has to deal with, that creates the situation where you must play perfectly or die ... it's the class for you.
---
Enjoy getting banned by blizzard for targeted harrasment and stream sniping.

GTA San Andreas. When the main character CJ, gets kicked out of a cop car in gang territory, he says the line. It's the first line in the game and the starting point for a memorable game filled with funny moments, so many people memed it.
---
Uh, you jump to the top of the mountain.. there's a portal that takes you right to that boss... \*insert mind blown emoji
---
&gt; There is no such thing as a DPS PvE Warrior in classic Raiding.  
---
Hmm.
---
I don't think you can say they didn't intend for some classes to end up as meme specs in pve. Classic wow had much deeper rpg elements and Dev's have stated before that classes should have a specific role and a unique identity. The meme specs are people taking what were envisioned as healers falling back on their secondary roles. 
---
And for paladin's, they were also worried about faction balance. Having faction specific classes from the start was going to make that challenging. But if they gave ally an extra tank it would have been unfair. Even if they buffed ele shaman to offset that, I'd argue that having another dps isn't as beneficial as having a tank with a pally toolset. And also good luck dealing with buffed ele shamans in PvP. Obviously they resolved this by giving both factions both classes.
---
At that point, restart the servers, and let me start all over again. I'll be 75 years old and on the 25th iteration of classic servers, still slaying Rag and his homies.
---
It sounds so perfect!
---
It doesn't, but the dude above thought it did, so he tagged /r/unexpectedThanos
---
I think if someone’s been playing for over a month, they’re not a tourist. It doesn’t matter what level, how far they’ve gotten, or how good they are. They might be a nub, an elitist, or a douche, but after that month of playing, they’re not a tourist. 
---
Except for gnomes, gnomes are always tourists. They only plan on being here for a short while.
---
I've never coded anything but this sounds like properly soul-crushing work.
---
Dps meter, threat meter, a questing addon. That may be all. Probably a DBM equivalent.
---
Druids are *the* hybrid kings in Vanilla and those who play the class have to pay the dues. Feral and Resto are the strong trees and Balance is the weak one. 
---
I had a Druid in TBC but I don't plan on playing Druid in Vanilla.
---
Past 40 ele is faster than enh even taking drinking time into account. It's also much better in pvp.
---
 Before 40 it's not ideal, mostly because of not having imp GW, but it's doable.
---
That is the thing you know it will happen and that people do it already devalues a lot of things. I don’t see annything wrong with being able to buy game time with in game gold.
---
Most players won’t buy gold and just buy game time with these tokens. These gold farmers usually hack accounts and sell theyr gold that is why I am pro selling gold from blizzard to destroy their market before it is there.
---
I feel like most of this community will be welcoming to newcomers. The problem is that this community is not representative of the real Classic WoW community, come launch. But we have to try
---
From my experience on this sub literally everyone cleared naxx in vanilla and hit rank 12 or 13. They know not to pretend they were rank 14 but it was the rank that gave you x. Nevermind you had to have farmed your life away and knew damnwell what rank you were if you were over like 7. You just can't remember any of the details.
---
From my experience as an ally huntard. My guild got hard shit on in naxx.Truest purest vanilla experience. We never downed a single boss. Granted I was just a B squad raider but I still sweated bullets pulling any raidmob even trash. Younger me felt like if I wasnt at my best every pull i was lettin these strangers down. I still feel that way. Excited to get that huge satisfaction of a boss down again. Maybe this time around I'll actually see aq40 and naxx all the way through.
---
Ah... this reminds me of the first time I played WoW...
---
I didn't, thanks for sharing :)
---
For me I think I’d just quit after having all of that time and effort just erased to start over fresh with no actual new content but I did make the post for opinions.
---
You say that...but I really feel like that's what it has to be at this point.
---
I'm a Warrior :C
---
No clue why people are downvoting you for asking a legitimate question ... 
---
Anyway, I think it's safe to say that it won't be, it'll more than likely be introduced in phase 2, with the introduction of Kazzak. Until then, the quest items won't be in Major Domo's loot tables
---
In reality, I'd rather it be like diablo if anything. Move my character to a permanent grouping of servers and have fresh servers.
---
More people will buy gold from blizzard, The thing about buying gold from china is the risk of being banned. Most people won't buy from chinamen for that reason. The economy will be in ruins because of the wow token. Chinese gold sellling was a thing back in the day and it was fine. Chinamen will sell gold and hack accounts regardless of the wow token
---
Friend plays Warrior, I play Paladin. It's just not even fair when we meet people in world pvp.
---
Ya man, and balance druids are brought for their top tier dps. Did you get that memo? I'll go ahead and get you a copy of that memo.
---
Hey now.  Gnomes are great. they make for good eating
---
I like some of the toys, but I think they went waaaaaaay too far. I don’t even give a fuck about the selfie stick. But I remember going through MoP and WoD, it felt like every 20 minutes I had a new gadget in my toy box that did some quirky thing. 
---
I’m not even trying to kill fun, I always loved using the staff of Archmage Vargoth, or the Sylvanas Lamenters from the Shadowmourn quest. It’s just a little immersion breaking when you can drop 200 random things on the floor.
---
Yeah, but it’s dead as hell, so it might as well not be
---
Ah then RIP. 
---
My only melee forsaken are Fem DK and M Rogue so I never noticed it, I notice it on BE though and it always annoyed me.
---
Interested. Will send a discord note
---
Actually hadn’t really considered that approach. If classic is successful, which I have no doubts that it won’t be, Perhaps blizzard will slowly implement a system of being able to play in specific expansion versions of the game. I’m aware of how much time, work, and money that would go into something like that but it’s an idea.
---
That would make my class selection much easier as I'd pick druid in that case
---
I kind of agree with the other guy. I think we’re gonna be in the minority.
---
I have a list of names for my characters, going to make one, log out, repeat. lol
---
Well, things are getting pretty serious right now. I mean, we chat in Barrens for, like, six hours every day so I guess you could say things are gettin' pretty serious.
---
Exactly what i thought, i mean grabbing 2 beers at my local bar is the equivalent of a months game time. And not just any game, the game that fucked my life up... in a good way
---
Prices are going to be low to start, low enough that you'll likely vendor a lot of that stuff. If that's the case then you're wasting your bag space on nodes which don't grant you xp. Might be better to just focus on killing and using your bag space for the drops off mobs, then you level faster and get to the better silver per kill mobs sooner.
---
People that refuse to use addons are basically shooting themselves in the foot. WoW's default UI is awful, it forces you to spread your attention across your entire screen to gather basic information. Preach made an amazing video about how Raiders across the years have separately evolved their UI's to be more and more homogenized to center it around where the action is so they never have to take their eyes off of the action.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFejOUmlhJw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFejOUmlhJw)
---
Maybe at the start. But I think only the players from vanilla, bc, and maybe wrath will stick around long term. Modern gamers prefer streamlined games.
---
The point is that if you use an addon like questie you get to feel that much better than the people that aren’t using it!
---
He probably means crescent staff
---
Rare Aussie? There are dozens of us!
---
It's almost like different people play for different reasons. Some people want to just level as fast as possible or don't like to explore. There are a vast number of other reasons that people enjoy vanilla over retail or other games and different people pull different things that they enjoy.
---
US
---
No shit I was playing with my wife on a P. Server the other day and were rip roaring up and down the Barrens because the quests are very spread out and I am FAR from being a speed leveler, I constantly go the wrong way or forget to grab the right quests in order and she says in a very serious manner "Why dont we start up our real accounts, then we would have all our mounts and money and stuff and we wont have to walk everywhere or pay for spell ranks."            
---

I'm looking for a divorce lawyer now.

Missing BC. Best xpac besides vanilla imo
---
With low res the mind can make a lot of subconscious assumptions. Low res is less clear thus more mysterious and unknown.
---
Just how the original doom enemies are still to me the most terrifying characters in any video game. It's the unnaturalness of them that you can put your finger on. But when everything is overly detailed you see what it for what it is, just an art piece.
---
I enjoy doing quests the old fashion way. It’s enjoyable to figure things out for yourself and get into the lore. But I also need to get to 60 as fast as I can otherwise I lose my raidspot. So questie is just a tool to help get to the part of the game I most enjoy
---
I agree. Love his videos.
---
I remember people hating MOP during.
---
Exactly, if someone’s gotten to 20 then they at least know a thing or two about Classic. They’ve probably died to fighting 1-2 mobs, gotten chased down by a harvest reaper from forever away, gotten 3 shot by a defias pillager. 
---
It already takes like 4-5 hours for a tourist to get to 10. I doubt 80% of tourists will make it that far and still play.
---
The only reason I could think to do skinning while leveling is to already have skinning by the time you get to be able to skin devilsaurs instead of coming back after the fact to level it. I wouldn't go out of my way, though.
---
Usually what I do is jumping while pressing the bind, so that the movement still goes.
---
Hey I wish I was. I’m jealous of those that get to experience the game fresh
---
Vanilla: Hunter
---
TBC through Cata: Priest
---
Classic: Warrior

I want easy groups as a tank and I want to wreck folks with an Arcanite Reaper.

I'm only 2 years old but I LOVE reading quests.  My friends think I'm crazy and they all use Questie!  I was def born 20 years too late!!!!!
---
I’m kind of looking forward to this sub exploding this July. All sorts of nostalgic memes and frustrations. Also, centerfold pics of Princess Theredras, like every day.
---
"I can't be happy about things I like, without shitting on everyone who likes something else."
---
Freal, I'm all in on the Classic &gt; Retail bandwagon but also not here for fat shaming
---
Skinning is less of a time kill than mining at least.
---
MoP was good for sure and even cata was a lot better than the last 3 xpacs imo
---
Continue the "classic" series and move onto burning crusade. They could go up to Wotlk and i'd play it. After that is when the game started to go down hill.
---
You're an excellent typist for a two year old.
---
There's a sizable population who just want to do end game, some want more group activities. 
---
Personally, most quests are boring for me, I prefer group activities like dungeons and raiding.
---
I too fell off after WotLK but I’m more thinking along the lines of what Runescape has done with Old School vs. RS3. Two separate games with diverging content.
---
Just play whatever, It doesn't matter whether it's the most optimal spec or not the most important is that you have fun playing it. (and I mean playing, not trolling with it)
---
What specifically are you having trouble with?
---
The eye of shadow required does not *only* drop of Kazzak.
---
So the only gating will occur if Blizzard decides to implement the eye of divinty in Domo's loot table from the beginning.

I enjoy reading quests and getting into the lore. But I also enjoy being efficient with my play time. Questie helps me not miss quests and group up the ones that are close together. It doesn't prevent me from reading the quest text and immersing myself.
---
Blizzard themseves have used the term tourist. It’s the large wave of newcomers that are “seeing what it’s all about”. You know, taking a tour. Now, that doesn’t mean it’s even an insult. I welcome tourists, and hope they stay long enough to *not be* tourists. The major reason that Blizz feels they need sharding for the starter zone is *because of* the tourist wave. There will be a lot of newcomers, half of which will stay and level far into the game. The other half will quit, either because they don’t like the play style, or because they don’t like the concept of dying in the open world, and taking care.
---
I don’t mean to speak for OP, but for myself, I can say that I don’t gatekeep when I talk about tourists, I very much like to keep the gate *open*. The more people who stick around, the healthier the game will be.
---
What is the meaning of every icon in the God row for https://imgur.com/isbJlCa ?
---
Now add a couple of hundred other players all saying the same thing.
---
No, you’ll be back for the complaints about druids and STV memes.
---
Hell yeah, Logitech's G600 is cheap as hell, lasts a long time and has up to 24 keys via modifier key on your ringfinger.
---
Been using it since WoD. It's a great Mouse!
---
#2 isn’t a legit concern. No one levels in healing spec and it’s silly to expect them to respec
---
Don't play on pservers, save that feeling of discovery and freshness for when Classic releases. Otherwise you'll just burnout and it's not worth it.
---
I was definitely in majority tier 0, maybe a couple of tier 1 drops, maybe shoulders by then not sure which came first but not a meaningful difference. Consumables will make up a lot and you can get some buffs from a paladin friend and mage say before heading in.
---
If someone buys gold and is caught they should be perma banned. Gold is so vital in vanilla that cheating by buying it should straight up cost you your account. 
---
Some would surely slip through the cracks but most would not take the risk.
---
I've appreciated your posts in this thread. Pretty much exactly how I felt. I was gone within three months of MoP's release after having fairly alienated the entire time.
---
Are you trying to be a min\max player? If not there is really nothing you need to have. 
---
If you are, or are going to be serious with PvP then engineering is a must. But you can level it from scratch at 60 in a day for around 100g in mats. Nothing you need to worry about on day 1. 
---
Tailoring is the other one, but again it's not something you need right away or even keep unless you want to. Robe of the archimage is bis for a while and is bop, so you have to make your own. In Phase 4 the bloodvine set is bis and if you are a tailor you get an extra 2% crit. But you'll only wear that in aq until you replace it. If you get the robe of volitile power in mc you can build a good set and avoid needing tailoring at all.
---
There are obvious differences in artstyle between the new and old models/animations beyond just polys and texture res. There's a clear middle ground between the old models and high-fidelity models that also look like rejected Kung Fu Panda extras. If you can't see the difference that's fine, but they could have been a lot better across the board, and shouting everyone down over rectangles is kinda missing the point.
---
Against rogues, cant even get fear of before i die. Hunters, cant even target them before i die. I have killed a couple of mages that mana shields my Searing Pain (lol). But maybe in general, for example as mages u use rank 1 frostbolt for instant slow, rank 1 blizzard for stealthed players and so on. What rank 1 spells are good to use as a warlock?
---
Well the funny part about that was I met more immature people on the horde side then the alliance but that being said it’s a double edge sword.
---
I would like engineering &amp; something i can make gold with
---
I've appreciated your posts in this thread. Pretty much exactly how I felt. I was gone within three months of MoP's release after having fairly alienated the entire time. 
---
&gt;Yeah, from the big picture it is, but not from the point of a single expansion when you are playing it
---
Very true. When ALL relevant content is and will be *that* for two more years it's pretty imposing for people who don't like it.
---
Maybe to an extent, but I disagree. Vanilla drew in so many new faces back in 04. And people will tell their friends who tell their friends, etc... it’s a social game, and there is a *gaping void* in social games right now. The leading MMO, BFA is as asocial as hell. 
---
I also think it’s hard to judge what the market wants, *based on* what developers produce. People HATE micro transactions, yet most games are micro transaction based, for example.
---
&gt;paladin friend
---
Horde :(
---
I’ve heard the scholo (or was it strat) pots did make a difference. I’ve looked up a couple of videos on YT that outline the quest but like my question none really say how geared you really should be before going in.

Thanks for the help!

I read all your replies.

This should have been the intro to the WoW Classic trailer...

---
Tbh the warrior vs rogue situation is the only one that screams Rock Paper Scissors. Rogues beat a lot of stuff, but then warriors stomp them unless they are extremely fancy. It’s one of the only times a rogue has to bleed his own blood.
---
What level are you and what race are you playing? Once you get howl of terror, that can really help you peel rogues off you. Also, saccing your void for a shield the moment they open up on you.
---
The reason to do skinning while leveling is for the extra vendor loot for almost every mob you kill. It adds up.
---
Please, never revert back to conventional style of writing!
---
I was wondering where the daily what happens after naxx post was
---
I think feral and resto are fine in PVP. Mainly due to their mobility. For raids I think priest and paladins will be better healers and shamans bring their totems, so they are decent but their battle rez is really their big claim to fame.
---
&gt; I hate NE starting spot haha
---
Hold on. Let's just back up a moment.
---
If you are new then as harsh as it sounds, it is likely a factor of a few things;
---
1) If you are leveling then Warlocks are fairly squishy, I mean Rouges will pretty much Ambush your entire HP bar away. 
---
2) If you are 60, then possibly it is a case of gear, trinkets etc
---
3) If you are new then it may be a L2P issue, which is NOT a bad thing, I would advice watching some warlock PvP videos or any caster videos to be honest! See what is helping these players get casts off and try to emulate it!
---
I spent years leveling on PVP servers, I've had my fill of...
---
Getting ganked and camped by random bored level 60s...
---
Having literally every questing hub destroyed and camped for days by the same people who keep coming back even after they're killed...
---
Getting sheeped and sapped for days by bored rogues and mages, I'd rather be killed than CCed forever haha
---
PVP Servers are a blast, don't get me wrong, it's fun at first but slowly turns into a nightmare, 
---
Want to put on some music and farm some ore/herbs? lol ganked and camped
---
Want to finish a long quest chain? lol gankers at the very end camping the NPC
---
Want to level up an alt later down the line? lol 60s everywhere camping everything
---
It's amazing when armies of Horde and Alliance attack each other's cities, that stuff is amazing, but when it's just bored high levels ganking everyone in sight, that's when it's not very fun anymore...and let's be real, 80% of world PVP in vanilla is just unfair ganking
---
TLDR; Going a nice cozy PVE realm haha
---
I refresh this reddit every 5 minutes on a daily basis(hyperbole, I know) I really haven’t seen another post. In any case, good talk. I really value that opinion.
---
I’m a gnome warlock at 25. Getting completely destroyed in ashenvale and stonetalon. I’m glad i will get a few spells later on that will help me with that, completely in love with playing lock right now!
---
Yeah, and there's more to it than just 'double fear' them. WOTF is a huge deal, and this isn't controversial.
---
Wow this post makes you sound like you tell people youre vegan or a honda ricer... why you even gonna but a civic if youre not gonna drop a type c into it her her herrrr
---
I think nothing happens. It's stays a wow classic server forever.
---
After this they will make new classic servers with the understanding that they will progress to TBC eventually. If profitable.
---
Or my personal favorite. Make wow remastered. With a level cap of 100 and including all expansions up to and including WOTLK. However the raids would be normalized to lvl 100 meaning your guild would have to progress through vanilla raids to do BC raids where the items would be better.
---
Ah okay. Did you have any input? Or were you here just to react negatively to the conversation?
---
I mean, I've done my route before so I am more than happy for a little prompt so I can zone out of the leveling process. 
---
People also seem to forget that some people don't enjoy the leveling. They just want it over so they can play end game or maybe they do like leveling and are a fan of the speedrunning life.
---
Each to their own I say!
---
Dude... thats pretty much exactly what I said.
---
Undead is shit, troll and orc rogue is arguably better vs every fight excluding warlock.
---
Why does it matter to you?  The addon is optional, you can personally choose to not use it if that's what makes the game fun for you.
---
Personally, I don't feel that there is anything to explore because I explored it 15 years ago on multiple characters.  Me (or anyone that's not you) using an addon like Questie has zero effect on you.
---
Go with engineering and mining then. Mining will get you the mats you need to level your engineering and any extra you can vendor/AH when prices are reasonable.
---
Efficient.
---
Also you have no A for your acronym.
---
Afaik, you don't know shit.
---
I'm not bothered by it, I'm just curious why you would use it. 
---
I mean you did everything else in the game 15 years ago as well. Why play it then? By exploring you might find something you didn't know was there 15 years ago.
---
Yep, as soon as I see a rogue get off his stealth I know I’m dead. Have not gotten a single rogue out of stealth with rain of fire yet. Thank you for the tips! I’ll take a look!
---
I forget what level your get howl of terror at (mid 30s?), but you should already have voidwalkwer sacrifice. Have you been buying your pet grimoires?
---
I know certain people will pitch a wobbly about my even mentioning it. But I've always had a pipe dream that they would continue development of Vanilla some year or two after Naxx has been cleared by a majority of the playerbase. Balance tweaks to bring the specs in line nad make the shit tier specs viable. Finish and introduce content that was planned/cut from the game (such as: Karazhan was intended to be a 40man raid after Naxx, during Vanilla, and much larger than what we got in BC), among other things. Like a branch away from the retail timeline but without adding an expansion pack or additional level cap. A what-if scenario where Blizzard completed all of their original plans and polished them painstakingly, if anything.
---
Then I would suggest mining and skinning while leveling, then dropping skinning for engineering. That will give you good cash while leveling and provide you with mats for engineering, plus you can farm arcane crystals. 
---
Or you could skip mining and go herbalism, since mages make really good herbalists with dme farm, and just buying engineering mats.
---
Very overrated
---
&gt; it was better back in the day when you actually had to read quests.  
---
I will never read the quests. I didn't read them back then and I won't read them now.  
---
Get me to 60 asap.
---
play all your games with a vga monitor and in 800x600 resolution
---
I know the endgame scene is pretty big, but is it really that big that people who hate levelling put themselves through it just to get to it?
---
Lol I still game with a wired dell mouse. Played through Legion with it.
---
Wow, I’m completely lost as a warlock, you get void sac from grimoires? The only spell I have on my void rn is taunt rank 1 haha
---
Ahhhhhh...good old Camp Narache.  I'll be back in Red Cloud Mesa again soon!!  It's been a while since I've been there on pservers, but going back again on retail Vanilla will feel like slipping back into a warm cozy vagina.
---
Groundbreaking.
---
Warlocks are mushrooms.
---
Red Dragon is bargain brand name imo.

---
Would be better, has less buttons to be sure, but is gonna be a lot better too.
---
This is a very biased analysis. Down Side to PVE would be more monotonous leveling and less immersion into Alliance vs Horde fantasy.
---
Is this good, though? More loot per mob means fewer kills per run into town to vendor which means slower leveling.
---
You're attributing your own definition of what's fun about the game to people who aren't you.  I'm going to play the game because I enjoy the game, I miss the game, I didn't finish all of the raids while it was current, and a dozen other reasons that have nothing to do with reading quest text or remembering which set of defies I need to kill for which quest. 
---
If you don't want to use it, then don't.
---
You should definitely buy all your voidwalker spells. Some people will tell you to skip the grimoires for you other pets to save money while leveling. But you get a free 40 mount anyway, and I think all the pets are fun, so I always buy them all!
---
Awesome. PM sent!
---
The site is pretty good for research. That's all I used it for.
---
Yes, skinning a mining is what I’m doing. I’ll probably post it on the AH for what I want to earn for it and let it sit in my mailbox and repost weekly. Just because it won’t sell day 1 doesn’t mean you should vendor it.
---
I'm in the vast minority on this but i am super anti addon, of almost all kinds.  I think it trivializes the game.  Quest addons are the worst, but people that use addons to make their class mechanics easier (rogue timer addons, hunter feign death/trap macros) are completely missing the point.
---
I hated leveling then. Hate leveling now.  The game starts at 60 for me.
---
You'd get more money from keeping the bag space open and looting a few extra items. A stack of light leather is only like 2 silver whereas even just one grey item can be a few silver in much less time and you can kill more mobs before running back to sell.

I may use it on my 2nd or 3rd character... but not the first.
---
Indeed.  I remember when I didn't know any better, actually looking at the frost tree for the first time, then going to the trainer to respec and get my shit together.
---
You know what was in vanilla? Healbot. You know what got banned from vanilla? Healbot. 
---
Bad argument is bad. Addons are a thing that exist and will be used.
---
Love this!  The music is one of my favorite parts of leveling up a new Blood Elf pally.  It screams TBC nostalgia for me.
---
I'm done leveling up on private servers now that Classic is coming.  Next time I roll a BE pally it'll be years from now when they release The Burning Crusade Classic, and it will be a sweet homecoming.
---
Yeah I noticed a lot of Logitech mice are like 60% off right now. Unfortunately that wasn't the case when I picked up this one. Like I said, it was just to try out a MMO mouse to see if I liked it or not.
---
any addon that functions against the api will be allowed
---
Oh, please... Low res stuff was scary because kids with hyper-active, naive, imaginations played them.
---
Hey, can you like, keep talking please
---
You're going to get pretty wrecked by most classes if they gank you as a lowbie warlock, especially by UD when you're on ally side. You can sac your VW and healthstone but generally that just means you live a bit longer, it's still going to be very hard to get any good casts off vs warrior/rogue/hunter/mage. Once you get deathcoil and get felpuppy for casters and CoEx/siphon life you'll have a much better chance.
---
I loved Paladin tanking in early BC, that model worked just fine.
---
literally 0% of my enjoyment in Vanilla came from leveling and quests. Why not streamline the small portion of the game I don't enjoy to get to the part I do enjoy?
---
&gt; Having hybrid classes that can switch on various boss pulls is awesome.
---
Your talents are static in vanilla unless you hearth and pay and get summoned back.
---
*More faithful*
---
Oh boy... Here we go again with da "I know how warcraft was supposed to be!" bullshit.
---
Ok got ya, thanks. I’ve never played that series but this thing has been coming up all over the place recently. Pretty fitting.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsL-akEhIoY
---
What makes it special compared to retail WoW? Isn't retail WoW much more sophisticated mechanics wise?
---
Lol this is such a weird thing to say. It's like choosing ice cream over KFC and then complaining because they don't want sprinkles. Vanilla with Questie is still absolutely nothing like Retail, it is a completely different game. Just because you very slightly changed the experience of 2% of the game doesn't mean you hate the other 98%.
---
It can be relaxing when you're on a PvE server and you don't have to put up with gankers around every tree.  But I spend so much time in STV leveling up, this music is a bit TOO familiar.
---
It's also about the fact that spending 2 months leveling in THIS era of Vanilla, is a disadvantage. Sure play the game how you want, love leveling the old way, but enjoy being rolled through by full BiS geared peeps before your 60.
---
Also, enjoy Phase 2
---
Not complaining, just genuinely curious why people use it
---
&gt; Once you get howl of terror, that can really help you peel rogues off you. 
---
Howl of Terror takes longer to cast than a regular fear. How does that help against a rogue?
---
&gt; 99% of them are just lashing out to cover their own insecurities over using them.
---
insecurities?
---
I just don't like leveling, get me to the good part of the game.
---
Even without Questie you can be 60 long before phase 2, even if you're slow. No worries
---
He hearthed!
---
If you are leveling, I'd just mount up and peace out. I don't think I lost a single 1v1 as a rogue while leveling in which I opened!
---
I can't be certain from this post about which side you're on regarding this. Are you saying people should need to sell or pass to someone who'd equip?
---
Short answer imo.
---
 Raiding: you can do good, never best. 
---
Nonraid-love: great, very versatile.
---
PvP: great, soo many options.
---
Very unique class, but you are kind a shadow of other classes, but never quite as good.
---
But, the best flag carrier ;)
---
it's a fun class, if you don't care about logs or min/maxing go for it.
---
Looks like an insane amount of work. Thanks for the quality content!
---
Hmmmm I will probably take this advice and take mining/skinning.
---
I couldn't play WoW these days without an MMO mouse. I have a lot of bindings and macros set up for the thumb grid. When I got my first one back in Cataclysm it changed my game forever.
---
Near the warlock trainer there will be someone that sells grimoires, which is a fancy word that means "spooky book". These books will teach new spells or new ranks of spells to your pets.
---
I thought it was instant cast! It's been so long since I played a warlock in vanilla, my bad if I was mistaken.
---
I think this guy is severely undervaluing stamina for a twink. 9AP over 90hp? Nah dawg.
---
Maybe unless you're specifically going ambush spec or something like that. Other than that stam is one of the most important stats for a low lvl twink.
---
&gt; you may even be considering Alterac Mountains instead of Ashenvale/Stonetalon (shit zones imo) at that time.
---
Alterac Mountains is a level 30+ zone
---
Hehe, spooky book.
---
Yeah, that's the music that starts playing when you enter Ratchet.
---
If Blizzard wants subscribers to stay, they should adopt the Old School RuneScape model. Such that new classic content, (maybe) unrelated to the other expansions, is developed and released based on worldwide polls.
---
added a extremly simplified tl;dr for the rotation part. I don't think that the entirety can be just rounded up that easily as it tackles a couple of different points
---
If you aren't hardcore pvp, engineering isn't needed. Pick the crafting one that looks coolest to you and the appropriate gathering profession.
---
If you know you want engineering, level it while you level and take mining with it. You can farm nodes for gold in addition to other methods like farming mobs that mage is particularly good at.
---
That's fair, but it's a little suspicious that there are hordes of classic fans (like myself) criticizing retail leveling and clamoring for the classic experience, but then mysteriously almost all of them suddenly only care about 60 and want addons to trivialize leveling.  Someone, somewhere, is full of shit.
---
Honestly, the biggest drawback is being squishy, and you can mitigate that somewhat as you progress by going frost spec.  After that, managing your mana bar can be a hassle as others pointed out, but that gets better when you level up to get mana gems and evocation.  Maybe its just been so long since vanilla, but I don't remember any huge drawbacks to being a mage beyond that.
---
It’s shocking how much money skinning can give you just selling it to the vendor.
---
I’ve read posts in the past that have tested things and I seem to agree for the most part. Someone could fact check me though.
---
If you’re getting light or medium leather, only skin for the increased skill, don’t skin every mob.
---
Once you get heavy leather, skin every mob.
---
The math was something like 10-12 gold total from the vendor for all of your light and medium leather combined. It’s just not worth it early on time wise.
---
 I do apologize for the length.
---
I'm not the type of person to toss a simple claim into the room without a proper backup of a detailed explanation for it. (Well I guess that much is obvious now)
---
added a TL;DR on the very top for that very reason
---
confirmed
---
That kooky music in the Brill tavern isn't played anywhere else.  Whenever I level an undead priest I'll hang out in there for a little while just listening to that crazy off-key tune.
---
I think you are overestimating the ban chance of *buying* gold, it literally doesn’t happen.
---
For me a lot is nostalgia, not gonna lie. I miss OG vanilla raids, and I far prefer the old talent system. And as a raid leader, i love the challenge 2-3 days a week of putting together the best raid, with the best group comps, gotta have that imp warlock in the MT group, pally 1 specced into lasting judgement for judge light on the boss, etc etc etc.
---
"Although I might have a measly shiv..."
---
That’s what in my opinion would work the best. I doubt they’ll just release classic and then never touch it again. At the same time I guess I could see that happening if classic acts as a constant revenue for retail.
---
Affliction locks can spec into the instant cast
---
Horde has always been my side but the Org music is played out for me.  Sometimes I'll turn music off when I'm there.  Love Thunder Bluff's music though.
---
The economy will still be in better shape with chinamen running rampant (which they still will be with a bnet token)
---
&gt; clamoring for the classic experience
---
there is no "classic experience" there's about 7 million classic experiences.
---
Cool story bro, having played WOW, the race with an extra pvp trinket obviously has an advantage in pvp when it breaks something your opponent does, but whatever.
---
Not in vanilla they can't. That was a TBC addition.
---
That's the rogue vs warrior match up though. The warrior is not supposed to win in situations like this(all trinkets and engi gear available). In normal circumstances if they met in the wild things might be different because the rogue might not have all cds up or tidal charm on cd or they might not even have tidal charm. you get the point
---
Except the classes were even less homogenised in tbc and were better balanced so this argument doesn’t really make sense. Pally tanks were completely different to warrior tanks. Spriest was completely different to hunter dps to feral dps, but they were all viable.
---
Mining is fine for earning gold but you'll have to save it for a while to make a decent profit. Low level ore will skyrocket in price once people start leveling alts or switching to engineering at 60. 
---
Skinning is a great source of vendor income and will help you out quite a bit as a mage. Many of the best AOE grinding spots in the game contain beasts. You'll really start to feel the gold per hour increase when you get to heavy and thick leather.
---
Ahhh
---
From TBC onward you would spec into instant howl. In vanilla it's a 2-second cast.
---
I noticed that in the other video as well, he kept talking about the ambush spec and ditching tons of hp for more agi (although he included the recommendations for non-ambush spec).
---
Ok buddy. You play undead because you like how it looks. At least other people admit that.
---
Sentence before that
---
&gt; A Warlock? Great - you will run to a Raid, summon everybody, use a Soulstone on a Healer, and then stand somewhere in a corner. 
---
Sorry buddy this is garbage lol
---
so this is not him trying to bait himself some donations huh
---
One recommendation is that you mentioned Raptor Strike having +20% crit on talents.
---
I'd be interested in seeing the talent build your numbers suggest, as I always kept my Hunter as an alt I've never reached high-level play with one.
---
BANG BANG
---
I'm kinda gonna miss the old installer with swapping out the discs! Don't even have a CD drive nowadays haha
---
Your wife's priorities are quite fucked up.  Good luck with the divorce!  You'll have more free time to play Classic.
---
From left to Right
---
Aimed Shot, Auto Shot, Multi Shot, Melee, Auto Shot, Raptor Strike, Feign Death, Jom Gabbar (as reference for trinket swaps if you want to) Auto Shot Followed by the typical mana recovery items. Major Mana potion (2 min cd) Night Dragon's Breath (farmable consumable on a different 2 min timer) and Demonic runes (same CD as Night Dragon's Breath, another farmable consumable that offers you more mana but that deals damage to you) and the typical icon for dual wielding crossed out - as you are supposed to do this with a 2 handed weapon
---
I imagine someone coming at you from a long way off, and doing a drive-by Reeeeeeeeeee that gets progressively louder as they are closer and then dies off as they run off the other direction off a cliff
---
Don't forget it costs silver every time you post.
---
Only viable melee hunter is 2x  Dragons call for PVP IMO
---
Oh gawd I'm looking forward to AB again.
---
"Call out incs!"
---
"INC LM!
---
"Mine clear, inc BS!"
---
Memories.
---
I did it during vanilla as a 15 year old, I’m going to do it now as an adult with a job.
---
I paid $60 Canadian for the 1000g needed to get my epic mount in vanilla. I had it the second I turned 60. That was the second time or 3rd time I bought it at that point. I had boe epics for level. The lvl 45 boe sword and then the Krol Blade. 
---
The point of my story is that I have to have purchased gold 20-30 times throughout Vanilla and TBC. Never banned, nothing from the GMs at all. 
---
They won’t be able to stop it. Shit i had two characters leveled to 60 for me! Paid service from a Chinese farmer. 
---
They won’t stop any of it from happening.
---
That's nice.
---
He also mentioned something about venomstrikes +nature damage increasing your poison damage? I dont think thats accurate, and you don't have poisons at 19 to begin with.
---
Also if you're going to make a video talking about the (lvl 60) enchants, include how to get them and the restrictions/challenges surrounding that.
---
The pserver veterans already level 2-4 times faster than normal players with Questie available for all. If you deny players Questie, that advantage will only increase for the players who knows this game. 
---
The only area where Questie really assists me anymore is that it reminds me to pick up the retarded quest chains that start in capital cities or off the beaten path (even though I remember most). These quests will 99% be forgotten by normal players without such an addon.
---
I started with the downhill trend of expansions. BC and WotLK were incredibly fun.
---
That’s me too except without the rank 14 weapons
---
No it isnt? Why is this upvoted? 5% crit from axe spec is strictly better than 5% reswing sword spec.
---
I agree, engineering is a lot of fun, and offers a lot of utility to level with. Though Personally I'd rather take Eng/herb then eng/mining. I've found that herbing is better gold with less going out of my way for ores.. or into caves *shudder*
---
Rogues and Hunters are really OP at low levels, If they open on you there isn't much you can do. Just fully dot them up and try to outlive their burst with healthstone, health pot, void sac and soul stone. At level 42 you get deathcoil which makes the fight a lot more winnable.
---
Does it matter? It's not a race. And if you care that much about getting to 60 as fast possible, you already have your route planned out to the tiniest detail anyway.
---
Except we’re not talking about tbc.  We’re talking about classic.  There were no Pali tanks cause they didn’t have the gear to tank.  Same with shadow dps.
---
People who live in California I always assumed. Same a MineCon.
---
Or you know: Wherever big conventions are held.
---
Ok I use it because I find spending time working out where to pick up quests and where to kill things and find quest items boring. Making this part of vanilla less boring doesn't diminish the other 98% of vanilla I enjoy, like making groups to do things you can't solo, pvp, taking your time and feeling like an achievement levelling up, getting gear upgrades that matter, recognising different players, having an active realm and guild community and killing things and questing efficiently.

---
Would that revenue stay constant if classic stays constant, though? I think subscribers will be bored fast after all original content is done. Also, I don't think that starting fresh is an option for Blizzard... For the same reasons as it isn't for RuneScape.
---
yes but going int holy and ret/prot. this person can heal on some bosses and either dps or offtank on others. in Vanilla you can do all to an extent
---
The only change I want for classic. Is I want feral druids buffed to be viable tanks in 5 mans and viable dps in raids. I know they technically are already but, I want it clear they work. Not having a second tank class for 5 mans is devastating. To be clear I know druids can tank 5 mans. They just don't. I want them buffed for a "culture change".
