Boo hoo, people keep telling me to stop using slurs. Woe is me.

You mean the cities sharded with people from 3-4 different servers are packed?
---

---
You’re very smart :).
---
It's amazingly hilarious that some random dude who likes the name Herod thinks he can "assign" people who play the game for a living to Faerlina.
---
As someone who intends to play on Faerlina, I am reassigning them right back to Herod.

I'm in a guild raiding later on, Empire: [https://discord.gg/bz5TmD](https://discord.gg/bz5TmD)

my wife and i were both on the same server same time same faction and couldn't even group with each other, tried inviting through friends list and it thought we were on different servers :(
---
Sometimes though, I really wish I could flag against a player in my faction
---
they hated him because he spoke the truth
---
been playing on RP servers for 15 years. can confirm the vast overwhelming majority of people there do not RP.
---
I know, it's easier to take the lazy way out: get that 'feeling' of being surrounded and involved by literally being surrounded by scores or hundreds of faceless anons.
---
You had that in the starting area, for sure.
---
You don't have it now, so you feel...empty?
---
So find out where people are...and go there. If you just \*expect\* strangers to always be hustling and bustling around wherever YOU happen to be...sooner or later you gonna be disappointed.
---
You create your community experience.
---
Ebbnflow has a levelling series where he goes full balance, resto, feral, hybrid builds etc. Watch his stuff
---
There is one of them and tens of thousands of other people. Not saying the server is going to do nothing to help reserve that name on some specific server. Blizzard is gonna have to do it for them. If even soda and asmon get the name they want on the server they want, I guarantee that blizzard did it.
---
Personally I'm ok if they just announced it after the name reservation, if they wait until launch day they are just being dicks for dick sake.
---
you should like a very ignorant and dumb person. Streaming makes sense... hating on streamers makes no sense and if anything your just jealous of their success.
---
Do you have a source on the "first couple of days" quote?

Can't you just join Pacific servers
---
Is anyone still defending this..?
---
Correct! Non-RP servers it's just non-offensive names and non-lore names. But the latter of the two would be stopped at creation (like naming your character Thrall).
---
Im rolling RP-PvP for the first time so this is just from me reading official posts and such and figuring it all out myself recently.
---
Excellent find, you are absolutely correct.  I forgot to remove wine-staging.   As for Haswell, I am unsure if there is much you can do about that.  I think the Vulkan cut-off was somewhere around 2014-2015, Haswell is unfortunately before that time in development.  Being said, there could be solutions out there outside of my knowledge.
---
&gt; 100% agreed. It infuriates me that they think they are above everyone

You are acting entitled af. Take a good hard look inward

Now you’re speaking my gamer language brother now that I am freshly divorced and lost custody of the kids the only thing i have going for me is dedicating all efforts into taking the fight to THEM DANG STREAMERS

No, it does.

I would love to!!! We actually really fell out of touch :( I don't even know if he's alive anymore. I've tried to find him so YUMAN IF YOURE OUT THERE....

Wow ... I want to play on thalnos but I am not an American citizen. 
---
So English wouldn’t be my native language... I can just hope that I don’t get blocked or excluded. I am German and live in USA. 
---
Thanks Brazilians.

In multiple places, with multiple characters!

Sorry I should say 33/0/18
---
With tier 2/2.5 and the right offset pieces you’re essentially a healer with teeth. Nothing better than having a sword and board on, and some cheeky rogue or war opens up on you sensing an easy kill, only to have you trinket the kidney shot, switch to a 2 hander, take 4/5 of his life in a hoj and hit him with a crit hammer of wrath as he tries to escape
---
Nationality != race
---
And there going to have followers come protect them and camp you. Lol.... just play the game it's literally not rocket science.
---
You’re doing that to yourself. A few people wanted to legitimize their hate/jealousy of streamers, it then spread to the whole sub, which GREATLY overexaggerated the impact that streamers will have on your experience. Can’t wait for Classic to actually come out and for reality to kick in.
---
I just think posts such as OP are entitled and cringy. If you care if a streamer is on your server, you are as much as a sperg as the ones following asmold around you claim to hate.
---

---
It’s not a month you’re wasting it’s 2 weeks. So even at $15/mo it’s $7.50 for the name reservation.
---
It's not a tiny amount of power. They can literally impact your ability to find groups on your server if they decide they don't like you personally.
---
Who is in charge of the server discord is a very important job for a realms community. You really don't want it in the wrong hands.
---
God I fucking hate all these dipshits. Force them all into quarantine on one server IMO
---
Take your studies seriously. TBC set me back a bit more than I would like to admit.
---
Theres just not enough people, some sacrifices will be made.
---
Yeah, instant queues are nice... but so is being able to level in relative peace and farm without getting killed over and over.
---
Because it forces people and guilds to change names which is an even worse of a cluster fuck.
---
Being forced to do something outside your control is a very bad feeling Blizzard would prefer not to emulate.
---
Can confirm had a Chinese tank I grouped with in beta who couldn't use discord. We talked ingame which he could do
---
Look, the client can be run as is for priv servers (aka real vanilla). you change one txt file and you connect to another address (pserver). The only thing that needs to happen is that the server respond correctly, but that has nothing to do with the graphics engine or transparency of water.
---
Nobody knows; but he will probably go where the other streamers aren’t; we are all just fucked.
---
This is incorrect, i trained swords on my rogue at lvl 8 on the stress test
---
1 pvp server for 14 countries in the oceanic region....can’t wait
---
Cause their fans are twats? 😂
---
LMFAO
---
I thought it was funny but I'm 4hrs late to the party, so...
---
Are we gonna need to make a guild dedicated to killing streamers on this server? SEG(Streamer Extermination Group)
---
Why do people watch sports then? This argument is so old and stale
---
G R O B M O B
---
I play Horde but secretly I love dwarves and especially that face.
---
It's those f*ing humans and nelfs I can't stand.
---
How is this any different than if that person went on a different server to begin with? You'd have less opportunities on a less populated server right?
---
Would you rather have the guild GMs creating alt characters to act as a guild bank to hoard all your guild's items instead of an actual guild bank? 
---
That's one of the reasons why I think Classic might fail after a while, because people are so closed to QoL features that don't change the Classic WoW experience at all.
---
Comments like this really show how the WoW audience has changed
---
I will because logging out of a character doesn't have any relevance to a queue
---
A few people wanted to legitimize their hate/jealousy of streamers, spread it to the whole sub, which then GREATLY overexaggerated the impact that streamers will have on your experience. Can’t wait for Classic to actually come out and for reality to kick in.
---
That’s my concern. I want to play pvp but my mates want to play pve. I had to keep turning off warmode when I played bfa to play with them.
---
Or you could, you know, stop being a xenophobe and expand your world by learning another language. 
---
Just a thought.
---
Simple answer is no mate. Welcome to the Human Race. Enjoy your stay anyway you can.
---
Thanks, this is great!
---
tell them pewdiepie is the best
---
I agree with you, but you're wrong about loot trading.
---
The only time I ever hated multiboxers where the few dudes who would multibox 3-5 elemental shaman in tbc and become omnipotent gods smiting people with more power then fucking Zeus.
---
Even then, we'd be losing an entire server to them. We didn't get enough servers to throw them away like that.
---
Because to play sports at a level that is televised, you actually have to be pretty good at it.
---
Any plug can just go on Twitch, set their shit up, and stream. Half of becoming a popular streamer is luck.
---
The idea does sound fun to me but I wouldn't want to do it unless the game was actually designed around running teams of characters (ie Dragon Age Origins style) and everyone was doing it.
---
I forget the name of the game and I don't know that it ever took off but I played a beta of an MMO that did just that with each player controlling three characters so you had to choose a team, set up tactics and formations etc. Was a good concept but it meant that each of the classes was quite basic in its skill set to account for it and pretty much every player just ended up running with the same three classes. With the greater complexity in WOW I could see that it would be a lot more interesting... and confusing.
---
image  if amy schumer put her layers on you
---
I just want to add, I feel like there has been and was genuine joy in everyone I have seen playing this game this year. Whether livestreamers, private server players, beta and alpha invites, people just investigating meta.
---
I cannot WAIT to see which direction Blizzard takes ClassicWow. I personally hope they feed the ecosystem after all the raids are released, and give us as devoted long time players a much deserved good experience. Unadulterated with microtransactions and LFG/LFR...
---
Coming from FFXI where NA and JP were on the same servers with player based rules (specifically JPONRY) I was always floored when a JP player played with my party and sure enough, they were AMAZING players. 
---
Granted, ffxi was a jp based game so the NAs were the BRs of their servers. I would feel terrible if I knew they spoke of us like we do BRs. 
---
I knew they didnt want to party with NA players but the ones that did, it was always a blast.
---
Id never discriminate a player for their nationality. I hate that this community is basically forcing them to find their own server. It's toxic as fuck.
---
What do you mean by Thalnos will be Azralon 2.0 and Faerlina will be classic Ragnaros or Quel’thalas? Sorry Im not sure what that mean.
---
https://github.com/Hoizame/AtlasLootClassic
---
Bartender let’s you have 10 action bars, the stock UI has 5 I believe.
---
&gt;and go there
---
But they are layered. I was going to meet my guild and it was empty because it was layered.
---
Bruh.. OCE has two servers. There is no fucking way they’ll dump layering. I feel so let down. This shit sucks
---
Considering all the people from ragnaros quelthalas and nemesis ive played with, while their demeanor is annoying the real reason I actively avoid playing with any players from those servers is because they make your average private server player look good.
---
Oh yeah good idea let me just learn Portuguese these next 14 days
---
Best content?  Are you talking about streamers?  Far from the best content
---
If someone dedicates their life to that single reason, I really feel sorry for them. I'd rather just enjoy the game.
---
This isn't retail. You aren't going to be spending all of your time afking while waiting for a queue to pop up and instantly teleport you somewhere.
---
I’m confused why it says Azeroth at the bottom of Eastern Kingdoms, isn’t Azeroth the name of the entire world? Or is there a bit or old lore I missed out on?
---
Lmao did you just unironically call someone "a smoothbrain"???
---
This sub is gold
---
So you have more data on it than they do?
---
I'm seriously considering it. Never been a real RPer but always done what I call soft RP, like making a fitting name for the race/class, wearing a thematic transmog (won't be an issue in classic lol), and making a little story about who they are in my head. People from RP servers are generally very pleasant in my experience pugging on retail too.
---
Preachs community is pretty chill. So I would only bank on drama time being the drama.
---
Dont listen to this guy. If you want to be half way decent there is a LOT going on with hunter. Low skill floor, very high skill ceiling.
---
I got my wife playing, my 9 year old has her own character on limited time, and my 7 year old gets to fish.
---
Different variables that pservers had to guess on without hard data.  They may have gotten close on many things but not perfect.
---
it's a victimless crime!
---
Yea I read that on the wiki, but I figured it was worth a try anyway. I'm traveling, so I am currently on my old reliable Thinkpad, but I'll have to give it a go when I get home on my desktop. Vulkan is truly a blessing, hopefully the need for windows to play certain games will soon be a thing of the past. Excellent guide my friend :-)
---
Confirm that undead warlock can pick up class quest from Durotar with no issues. 
---
Tauren hunter (lol) can not pick up class quest from Durotar, you get sent back to mulgore.
---
I don't know how it works for each Indivudal combo.
---
I am playing on the german server with english client aswell and I wouldnt worry about that to much. The only acces to classic server for the last 10 years was private servers. This servers have almost always been english servers. While looking for a german guild i have come to know that many people play on eng client because they are used to it from their recent classic experience.
---
It's actually like asking for fries from chik fil a during breakfast and them saying you gotta wait 5-10mins for them and having a hissy fit. You're still getting what you want, but its gonna be awhile for perfection. They COULD of sold this as a 60/40 dollar game as a remake like other publishers. But they're not. ( they know people would of paid for it and dont kid yourself think a mass of people wouldn't)
---
 They're also giving it to you for just a sub with their main game included that could of also been separate and an additional fee. 
---
It's called being entitled. Complain when layer actually lasts longer than they say, if it even does. Were you there when servers would literally go offline and be unplayable for days due to lag even if they were up near the start? Would you take days spent down over this? Would you rather fight 6000 people to get the 1-10 stuff vs 1000? What experience does that increase? Be thankful for blizzard not really changing the game at all. 
---
Layering will affect you as much as falling through the world does. A mild annoyance that you'll get over in a few days.
---
There is not nearly enough servers. They had 10 million people willing to come back for WoD because of nostalgia. If even 1/4 of that come back they will need to make dozens more servers.
---
Happened to me too man.
---
It’s not, are you kidding? The map was altered, that does not make that cata zones.
---
&gt; I really don't fucking understand all this angst over streamers. Streamers go where the population is. Streamers go whatever the new hip thing is. In a few months, the bulk of them will move on to something else. Classic is not going to have some massive audience after that time. Why all the damned worry?
---
I don't know about you but I want to be able to enjoy the game from when I start it. Not after the streamers leave. I mean we all waited this long for Classic. If the streamers would play off stream, that'd be great but sadly they don't.
---
Damn that is pretty depressing. I was under the impression that layering went by area and that seemed like an ok, if not ideal, solution to deal with overpopulated areas early on given the potential for player drop off later. With so few people around though it just seems totally unnecessary for that to be layered so is each layer just server wide instead?
---
You could have 5 times that amount of people in just that area of Org without it needing to be layered. I remember when we gathered as a guild we would just find an empty spot to stand in and other guilds would do likewise so it was never an issue that there were too many people around in cities.
---
Yes people are. Demanding streamers not play on the same server as you and demanding they decide before you aka going out of their way, is acting entitled and like your owed shit.
---
Thanks I’ll give it a try!
---
"Wow this company is bringing back a 15 year old game, we should all thank the heavens"
---
How do you defias brotherhood guys treat people who wanna do pve content? Ive been playing on argent dawn since cata for.. some reason and it's gotten so bad if any guild even advertises theya re looking for raiders on the forums they get attacked by a bunch of morons who cant seem to grasp you can do content and RP on the same server. I wanna avoid that this time around but at the same time i prefer the general vibe on rp servers
---
Go outside
---
What? Did you reply to the wrong thread or something? This thread is about people not wanting to play on streamer servers.
---
Some were, but mostly you had guilds doing the shit streamer fans do now.
---
It's not the language barrier, its the extreme toxicity that has been a pillar of BR gamers since 2003.
---
fuck me, okay. Thanks! It gets confusing, for some you keep the -master and others you remove it.. Haha, thanks anyway.
---
Wow a whole 12 guilds...

Because I like having indoor plumbing.

Engineering is necessary for pve as well as PvP for rogue.
---
That and herbalism to stay in top of your consumes and make money.
---
Yeah no. That would be so stupid. Just change realms after if it's an issue.
---
It makes no sense to define Sperg as someone who spergs out.  I feel like you don't even know that the origin is based around labeling someone as if they have Aspergers.  Just like calling someone Autistic who isn't or retarded who is not mentally handicapped.

Your use of normie, pepelaugh, and boomer is more telling of your own base iq than anything about the person you have responded to.

very happy for u :) im glad that a lot of ppl that tried vanilla for first time loved it so much. it truly is a completely different game and a lot better

So thalnos is the worthless server that will lose you battlegrounds when they inevitably implement cross realm bgs.
---
They’ve already announced they are going to one server. Which one specifically will be announced on Monday. Stop bitching and at like an adult.
---
Mald PepeLaugh
---
I agree with that as well but we both know they don't give a fuck.
---
Hi Nieve, id like another slayer assignment.
---
You seem really angry.
---
Let me tell you a story.
---
When I started this game I played hours upon hours at a time. I leveled each class to max level within 8 months of starting to play this game. I cleared as much content as I could.
---
Then I got married, had 3 kids and now I dont have the time to play a lot. So yes I shortcut to save time.
---
As for p2w. I know in GenZ/Millenial world that is some sort of insult maybe? In my world, I work too hard for my money to throw it away on a video game for some competitive edge of pixels. 
---
True I spend extra on 3 subs occasionally. In the long run I am saving time and for someone in the business I am in, Time is money friend"
---
&gt;Say what you want but anything else is cheating period fuck you the end.
---
Grow up

To be fair, Windows has A LOT of bloat that consumes system resources in the background, so it's not too difficult to achieve better performance with a basic linux installation haha. I'll be trying out your guide on my desktop to assess the stability and if I deem it adequate, I'll wave goodbye to my Windows partition.
---
When you start going OOM.

Are you American?

google "natural hourglass figure" plenty of women who go to the gym have a small waist.
---
Vicious fanboy case and point. 
---
Feel free to sully your chance at a good time by supporting this streamer bullshit but don't come crying when you realize how much you've fucked up later down the road.
---
Yes, having public chat channels turn into twitch spam has no affect on anyone.
---
Even longer login queues due to hoards of fanboiz has no affect on anyone.
---
Hundreds of people feeding their idols with gear/mats/gold has no affect on anyone.
---
Once you get to barrens, where you don't have a constant influx of fresh players being funneled into layers, it feels REALLY empty.
---
I've played on a dead private server recently, which had far, far more people throughout that part of the game. It feels wrong.
---
This is moronic. And it's pretty funny to be calling streamers "entitled" while announcing on Reddit what others can and can't do on your chosen server.
---
The honor cartel is much more willing to play 16 hours of BGs per day than a streamer, that actually has to entertain their fanbase.  16 hours of evading other premades and stomping pugs is absolutely mind numbing content,as stated above.  They wont be doing that.
---
Thanks! I was confused to see that the server volume was "Heavy', figured they were live. Guess that is the beta key people?
---
It's grouse mate. :)
---
An amazing SL Warlock will get pratically anyone 1v1.
---
Op shiet.
---
Why do they want to play normal? Alliance? I say just play PvP and find new friends. If you’re horde you can join me!
---
Your reddit post really told em good
---
is this some fresh pasta?
---
Then play it, it’s never going to be the same experience you had, imagine getting triggered at someone else playing the game.
---
And if he goes PvE? What then?
---
Such a piece of shit. He's monetizing our fun. He is playing the game to make money, he has forfeited his rights to ha e any fun.
---
Was this changed recently? 
---
Sounds more like they should change that "feature" of Discord than add a differentiation case between the Classic and Modern games.
---
Hey there, I'm making sub domains for all these. We can compare lists later if you'd like, but I'm currently at work doing a double behind the bar so it'll have to be tomorrow. Pretty much every class and realm has a something.classicdiscord.net address
---
Jesus this is cringe.
---
If you think the developers give a shit about what the 2500 people in this echo chamber say, you are naive
---
Yeah people downvoting are just mad I called their non-RP servers toxic. Seriously, after spending a few years on a PVP server and transferring to RP, the difference was night and day.
---
Asmongold and his rodent DNA can fuck off

The real question is can the mobs see it... hmm...

If you would’ve told players back in the vanilla days what blizzard is now they wouldn’t have believed you. I remember playing vanilla one day killing mobs when all of a sudden I die from a fireball. An ogre appears and it’s a blizz go, he rezzes me and we shoot the shit for awhile. It was those kind of interactions that made blizzard such a great company, fuck what they’ve become now
---
I was thinking of doing engineering/mining, mining to supply my engineering needs. Does herbalism make a notable amount more than mining?
---
With all the added features to make it feasible to be done/not be a money sink, it was a impossibility to be anything than what it is. I guess since they're not making you install with cds is making you angry?
---
And I saw 100 people combatting everything he does too. This was from other streams. 
---
Also all those people sniping him have nothing to do with you. When do you ever need to be in the same exact zone as a streamer besides world bosses, cities and the very beginning of the game?
---
Scarab lord and r14 isn’t feasible for 99 %% of people on this subreddit let alone the game. And if you’re truly capable of it I highly doubt asmongold is gonna make it impossible for you. (In fact that he’ll make it easier. Get a group of people and just camp him and his snipers, if you’re actually good enough to get r14 I bet you and some equally skilled people would shit on whatever they’ve got.)
---
Again I’d rather not roll on a streamer server because of the annoyances. But I’m not gonna be a dick and streamsnipe because I’m upset that I don’t know how to share an experience with people and things I don’t like.
---
Hey everyone in this fucker's guild, if you want me to create a screenshot of you at level 15 with under 6 hours /played, just PM me your character name, race, and class.
---
But I will only do it under one condition!
---
You must become one of the seven raiders that he will depend on to douse the runes to summon Ragnaros. And when it comes time to douse your rune, you must refuse, ending his chance at a World First Ragnaros.
---
There's no way they'd intentionally fuck up classic out of spite. How would you justify that to executives?
---
It's rather just a case of underestimation/incompetence/arrogance.
---
Yes, lets lose an entire server just so 10 dudes can make money while playing WoW all day.
---
Feral tank isn't bad at all. My guild had one through aq and theyre really close to warriors in terms of tanking ability. You just need to be on top of consumes more 
---
Skarm tank on YouTube has some good videos on bear tanking
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-WHW-QNswE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-WHW-QNswE)
---
I am really really looking forward to compilations of streamers getting ganked
---
Condolences
---
Because they have enough PR problems without inviting more by "catering" to streamers like that. Why would they invite that on themselves?
---
Sorry for your loss.  Glad you could find reprieve from the sadness and stress for even a short time.  Best wishes to you both and happy gaming.
---
You don’t lose anything, you won’t be on that server. Stop. Crying.
---
I wish I could be as delusional as this sub. No wait.. I don't. Being outraged about everything and seeing the impending doom which won't happen instead of just looking forward to Classic like I'am sounds like a really boring way to anticipate Classic.
---
Wow you're kinda delusional dude. Asmon reels in an easy 20k viewer floor and upwards of 75k for the exciting moments on beta. For launch he'll hit that again easy. And you think of those 75k viewers only 100 want to play classic wow. Have you ever seen how many people follow him around on stream?
---
Herbalism is good for poison crafting and such. Might as well get alchemy to pair with it.
---
Bro steam does the same thing. You can load any game "through" steam, and have steam call it anything. I used to play "Lord of the Dongs: Battle for Balls Deep" or some such silly name and people would message me with "wtf are you playing?!" all the time.
---
In the named server date announcement they said they would specifically looking at the data during the name creation process to decide if they need to add more servers or not. If 25K spanish speaking clients sign up through name creation they might consider spinning up some SA servers or more NA PVP servers.
---
All they have to do is announce they decided they would need more servers and have another name reservation day a couple days after that. Plenty of time before launch.
---
I did it before.
---
Its a lot of fun.
---
I'd say yes.. yes we do expect that
---
It’s the stress test. Anyone with an active sub can log in and play. Level cap is 15, ends Monday morning.
---
Its not whiteknighting to call out blatant racism. It doesn't matter if you've been to Brazil or not, you're saying racist shit along with the whole thread.
---
Nice
---
I'm not saying streamsnipe him, I'm saying get them their own fucking server or something. I do not want to play with them or his friends. Have you seriously ever played with these people? Have you run into his toxic behavoir bullshit? I've been on his server since before he was a meme. Back when he was a nolife moron who treated everyone like shit and was completely entitled to everything. I give up, you simply aren't gonna understand because you are one of his viewers.
---
Isn't it ironic... Don't ya think?
---
It's not a lost server anyone can play there. It just may not be the server some of us want.
---
Here's a simple rule:
---
Inside the Addons folder should be the folder with the name of the addon you want. Inside that folder must be the .toc file and any other files needed by the addon. That folder and the .toc file must have the same name.
---
Surly this shouldn’t happen if you are in a Party? Seems like it must be a bug?
---
I didn't know Thanos snapped Azeroth.
---
lol, I'm Brazilian and I want a non-brazilian server too....
---
Valid point
---
why do you think it's blue
---
I'm glad you skip past the actual point of the post to just openly cry about streamers, if you want to do that, go reply to the 2521341 other crying posts about streamers, thanks.
---
Functional adults dont just take shitty circumstances on the chin. Functional adults are proactive about issues and do something about them. Perhaps you should be more like an adult yourself, yeah?

Damn, I should play there then! Keep America great
---
RISE UP AND TAKE BACK CONTROL FROM THESE FALSE PROPHETS!
---
It is a good point that people who joined late into vanilla of course would not hit max level before TBC.
---
I wonder if the stat means they didn't hit 60 during Vanilla or that they gave up entirely and didn't hit 60 even post-TBC.  I'm not sure we have those stats.  Just some comments by the devs.
---
PAPA GROBB
---
Should organize a hunt on streamers if the go on the same server.
---
It’s interesting to me that they’re the ones preaching about “the community” that made classic great, and how they’re so passionate about the game... but they’re simultaneously fine with destroying it for personal gain.
---
A DPS warrior without raid gear is just not going to be super great end game.  However, a tank warrior who only casually raids can rock and roll and always be in demand.  Even as a somewhat under geared tank, you will find raid/party slots. The reason is, many of these raids just downright require multiple tanks, and everyone's tanks wont always be online opening up pug slots.
---
They promised it'll be gone by phase 2. I don't see how. If we assume population has fallen down to 1 million players, that's still over 90k per server. (Also it won't be a perfect distribution). The only other options are they leave it in for phase 2, or they delay phase 2 long enough until the population has fallen to something like 100k, in which case you'd have a bit over 9,000 players per server - with none of the 'changes' which private servers have done to make servers of this size work.
---
What server do you play on?
---
&gt; They can’t but streamers can?
---
Can't you see the difference between saying (you):"You can't play here" and (streamer):"I'm going to play here".
---
Still i'm going to keep away from any streamer server best i can.
---
Why would I argue with a 3 year old.
---
IMO it's a good thing for a PvE realm, since you can't really interact with players in the other faction. If you're going to run into other players, might as well be people you can chat and group with.
---
However it absolutely sucks for the players on the minority faction. There was like 5 horde on Stormrage compared to 40,000+ alliance. It was a rare sight to see one of them.
---
what surprises me more is why the hell everyone is saying "dd" instead of "dps" on the eu stress servers. like lfg RFC need tank and dd. ive never seen that ion the 15 years ive been playing mmos and now everyone is saying it exclusively
---
really the only cancer is asmongold.  other streamers like tipsout baby and preach are pretty respectful.
---
Is that supposed to be a capital where people go for trade and lfg? Looks like a small village with that little amount of people.
---
[This sub in a nutshell](https://tenor.com/view/daniel-bryan-fickle-gif-13060126)
---
Rouge can not sap a mob that is in combat.  The rogue of course isn’t in combat since he is stealthed.
---
Can someone coherently explain what is so bad about having streamers on your realm?
---
Yes. You can't see any people from any other layers, and the people you are amongst change on a daily basis - so you might never meet the friendly guy you quested with out in the world again.
---
Just the fact that there are multiple "realities" shifting its population every day - like the reliable enchanter in front of org bank, which you suddenly can't see anymore because you logged into a new layer.
---
You also have several examples (like the top post on the sub) where people are phased out from their friends. Or earlier today, when I logged in and couldn't see my friend in Durotar.
---
It's a massive blow to immersion, and that's without even getting into the consequences of borderline-exploits possible with the feature.
---
I wouldn’t know, I can’t watch that stream it drives me insane.  Clearly you’re a follower though! Good try at switching gears when you already made yourself sound foolish.
---
Thanks for playing.
---
Streamers don't really acknowledge either their influence, or the effects of their actions.
---
It's an ego driven career, with no oversight, no limiters, and not really any regulation to their bullshit.
---
Like I don't blame them for making money how they can, of course not. Like fuck capitalism, absolutely fuck it. But what these guys are doing is just, well a talking head with no external moral compass. We are all fallible when it comes to morality, we are often checked by those who aren't us, but these guys don't get that check, they don't get it nearly quick enough at least, and it leads to really shitty behavior that's detrimental to the health of the game.
---
The game assumes we're all faceless mooks, not that's we are an army behind a single person. It fucks up all kinds of balance and game mechanics.
---
Sharding killed retail WoW, layering will do the same to classic if its not taken out by the time people hit 60.
---
Still crying about everything? Look, I know it's tough being wrong about everything. Thinking Classic would have 10 million subs and then they launch with 11 servers in NA, ROFL. If you don't want to play Classic with the other 500k max players after three months, then you can go back to your 1k pop pserver.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Or play BfA with the other 5 million subs.
---
The more attention you give to streamers, the more money they make.  Who gives a shit where they choose to make their character?  Odds are slim you'll ever interact with them anyway.
---
I love these, but please do some horde zones! i feel like the lift on the back side of Thunder Bluff would be a good loop animation!
---
Oh yeah same but I’m just saying a lot of people will end up leaving. I don’t think it will gain people I think it will have a bunch then lose people. That’s probably wha they are planning on
---
Sub 6 hour for 15 is nothing
---
We've got 17ish more days, might as well do a couple more loops
---
&gt;The Group is managed by a Council of Guild leaders from each guild that joins the server that creates a system of checks and balances and ensure that the rules are put out to the discord are being followed and that the players are being held accountable for their actions as well as maintaining a level of professionalism among the server and other guilds, The leadership is meant to keep each other in check and to ensure a fair balance is struck.
---
Two things.
---
1. Holy goodness you want to be god emperor of a server but you can't figure out where to end a sentence?
---
2. This isn't a pserver so you can't just run it how you like.
---
Sorry to tell you but this subreddit is overrun with those players that are still defending blizzard right now. They had to come along and shit it up for the rest of us. They couldnt just let us having fucking classic REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
You’re pretty safe when you’re surrounded by a raid, no?
---
I mean, if you care that much about a silly name, then you pay 7 dollars, and if not, you don’t. It’s pretty much like cosmetics.
---
Also most people already have a subscription
---
:pikaminediamonds:
---
Or they want their names, just like I want mine and you want yours.
---
Only saw 10 people in Stormwind on my layer in stress test, does blizzard think this is OK?

More autists and weeb shit going down.

Unfortunatelly (and im brazilian), its simply not true that the toxic huehue no english spergs are a minority

They want their names is the main reason
---
The name "Austismo SA" doesn't offend me like it does for the guy above me, and multiple other people in this thread. 
---
So no, I'm not being sensitive.
---
don't do that, don't give me that hope.

Joking lol, I'm glad for you two!

Are you a retail tourist or something? You can't just pretend that a group of dozens of people isn't there.
---
I am not saying he's right or wrong here, but if someone is a bad leader, and people choose to follow him, that's just the shitty pied piper leading away the cringe fanboys. We win either way. Also 3 man pom pyro teams with coordination will beat any 20 man healer team protecting a streamer.
---
This is clearly a feature.
---
Instead of adding WoW tokens blizzard should just have random bots send messages to players sometimes to buy gold with a website. Players can go to the website blizzard has, pay them, recieve it in game, and then after a few days you have a 50% chance of being banned. 
---
Blizzard get's money, and it stays true to classic! (/s... well kinda)
---
Same lol
---
You are just wrong dude, please inform yourself. The whole old world, including content, e.g. zones, quests, mobs, everything got updated in cataclysm. 
---
Your ignorance just hurts.
---
To me that sounds like hyperbole and exaggeration. I do not recall any case with any MMO where streamers were making the game unplayable or miserable for everyone else. If you know of such a thing, please point me in the right direction.

&gt;anyone who isn't freaking out over layering is a BLIZZARD CORPORATE SHILL DRONE!!!!
---
Yikes.
---
Brazilians have earned their reputation in the gaming community, that much is obvious. They’ve also earned it in the sports world. That’s just how a lot of young Brazilians behave. 
---
Plenty of Americans are complete jackasses in real life and terrible players online. If I were an EU player I’d probably avoid NA gaming servers. 
---
Does that mean the EU is racist against Americans? Nope. Different cultures don’t always get along well, and that’s typically not a race issue but many factors including regional culture, social norms, socioeconomic conditions etc.
---
CAREFULL. while the starting zone quests work for other races... CLASS QUESTS DO NOT!!! Hunter quest, warlock quest, warrior quest, ect... Have to be done in your starting zone
---
I just want to know where i need to save my names. :(
---
Dude never even fucking played vanilla.
---
Like I didn't either, but come the fuck on I'm going to take it slow and like casual cause I don't understand and don't know what kind of time this game will take. I get some of the mechanics and shit, and I've played WoW enough to understand the community, but I sure as shit ain't making these kinds of demands as a god damned wrath-baby myself.
---
If it's a rogue or warrior you definitely can cc with ff and roots.
---
Druid burst isn't bad either with the balance/fc/ns setup and a hero charm. You're gonna have a hard time 2v1ing any comp with a priest, warlock or any healer but that holds true for literally every class. 
---
Use grenades, open out of stealth and trinket swap correctly and you definitely can win 2v1s
---
You're allowed to gatekeep your own guild.
---
I have never played a private server, we are not running the server it’s a community discord
---
What a toxic community
---
Imagine trying to win a stupid fucking debate on a tangent essentially completely unrelated to the actual conversation. I’m done responding to you.
---
1 boss in bfa has more abilities than an entire raid in classic. the actual in-instance content will be a cakewalk. but like you said there's more to it then that. preparation takes a lot of work
---
Asmon and Soda both have plenty of chars with other names, I doubt they care a whole lot about their names being available. The big streamers are gonna stick to a server regardless.
---
If you are given the choice between:
---
-Layering
---
and
---
-Game is fucking unplayable due to 1000 people in the same zone
---
Which would you choose? Honestly.
---
That's some fellowship of the ring shit.
---
Maybe its my class, but I can solo elites in Nazjatar since like ilvl 380, dunno what you are going on about.
---
This is the same guy that died doing the "in dreams" quest
---
Yeah you are lmao 
---
Getting all butthurt and shit because someone said they don’t like something
---
I know a few people that only have ever had a taste of admin/mod authority and will burst into crying if they lose their rank. It's all they have in life that makes them feel important.
---
That's hilarious that anyone thinks a guy who never plays without an AV group's worth of bodyguards could be intimidated by four guys posting on a message board.
---
This will only encourage streamers to play on Herod for more delicious Herod drama for their stream.
---
I don't really care about streamers or people trying to fuck with them. But if you choose to broadcast your position to the world then it's your own fault if people go out of their way to target you. As much as a disadvantage as that is, they seem to gain a whole bunch of other advantages from having massive hordes of people helping them out through the game.
---
Org looking dead is intended...
---
If everyone in your layer is somewhere else, you won't see dick in the capital city. That's SPECIFICALLY how it was designed, coded, and implemented. There are 3k people per layer, which is another version of the ENTIRE world. Where those 3k people are is a fucking guess, and sometimes the majority may not be in any major city.
---
No gear to switch. I just know you're not worth having a discussion with. 
---
Thank *you* for playing c:
---
Wait why is boomer an insult now? It's just people who were born at a certain time period. What the hell is wrong with that? 
---
Also quoting Asmongold for whatever the hell you are trying to say... cringe.
---
I don't know where you work but in most corporate professional environments, being on reddit would not be ok.
---
Between the streamers and these server manager dudes are making me really want to roll a rogue.
---
Who could Tips possibly be carried by to make that possible?
---
Did he get a spot in APES or something?
---
Then you need to reread your single run on sentence because that's not what it says!

Its shorthand for person with asperger's

I'm pretty sure most of them want to go Faerlina at this point.

tasty tasty treat
---
Shitty streamer on your realm - gank and corpse camp the scrub
---
I agree totally. And I would venture that most of the classic community is really happy. It's that whole vocal minority thing going on here with all the bitching and nit picking. You are right though. Some people can never be happy. And if everything was absolute perfection, people would bitch about having nothing to bitch about.
---
ah thanks!
---
Have fun feeling like you’re a hero fighting the Nazi regime.
---
Thank you. I have to go on retail and figure out all the frame sizes though, Luna comes in a bit too big on stock :9
---
I don't think so, not really. Like, for example the owner of 8chan isn't a racist because people who use 8chan use it to talk about racist stuff. The degree of this persons involvement in the boards is important, but thats just my opinion i guess
---
As we've aeen in the beta I think blizzard will have some sort of priority queue system for streamers.
---
Troll translates to “people that have a different opinion than me”
---
It's not even a lofty requirement, he just worded it like the absolute douche he is.
---
Dude came up with the name "Warcraft"
---
wow USA people really hates South Americans
---
Yep,
---
One 
---
Cohesive
---
World.,
---
# nochanges, and then everyone bent right over, cupped blizzard and said thank you daddy for the gift of layering.
---
I agree in principle but the effects on me are the same. World bosses and whatever lucrative farm exists are still limited to me. And a bunch of idiots fighting for attention also doesn’t really matter to me.
---
No matter where you play in classic there are already discord’s for each server like this
---
I played a PvP server with a gap like Fairbanks in vanilla. It was absolutely miserable on the smaller population side.
---
IIRC, pressing the sheath weapon button can bug it out to how you see it here.
---
And this has always failed in the past? Those new servers are NEVER highly populated and always dominated by a single faction. History shows us releasing new servers post launch with free transfers to them does not fix this problem. People organize things before launch and I guarantee you they will try to sit through the queue times before server transferring. New servers will more than likely just further fuck the ones that were there on launch making faction population less and less even.
---
Wrong forum.
---
Yeah man, it’s a recipe for disappointment. The game is obviously going to have a large player base, people have been playing it on private realms for years. But this isn’t going to make MMO’s mainstream again. Just enjoy it for what it is, don’t miss the opportunity to experience this fully because you’re obsessed with it overthrowing retail or something.
---
I never understood streamers who always complained about being sniped.
---
If you willingly broadcast everything you're doing to the world in real-time, are you not responsible for anything that happens as a result of it? It's simply the price you pay for the privileges it affords you.
---
I honestly have no idea, its a total wildcard to me.
---
I mean at least a few more would be nice but only Blizzard knows the total numbers.
---
95% of the time you encounter one in LFR or Mythic+ PUGs, they are awful and likely to ruin your run.
---
This is the guy who actually bothered the police because he thought he was getting arrassed by Alexensual's community. Drama queen.
---
Dozens? Try thousands m8...
---
Just got fooken layered.
---
&gt; camp streamers.
---
Good luck even finding them until phase 2, getting on their layer is probably going to be a 1 in 30 dice roll.
---
I don't think that is what troll means. Sounds like maybe your personal definition?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ev-cy000SaM
---
Either a fake screenshot or he's joking. It took him 10 hours to get 15 on this stress test launch LOL.
---
He's awful?
---
GM wants people in his guild who can level fasts. Asks for proof that they can level fast. /u/uimbtw cries about it.
---
but that would interrupt us surrendering to our base instincts of tribalism and mob mentality.
---
Well mages get some free hit from talents, locks don't for pve seeing as shadow bolt is destro and destro spells don't have a hit talent.
---
Is this real life????
---
And deleted after all that hard work.  Server God 0 : Reddit Trolls 1 !
---
It's to react to population drop. If the population doesn't go down like they expected they will probably just add more servers.
---
Layering should exist in level 1-10 zones and that’s it, but even then that’s suboptimal compared to dynamic respawns. Neither is blizzlike but at least one of them feels like an MMO. No clue why they are insistent on shooting themselves in the foot when an obvious solution is staring them in the damn face.
---
Nah, sperg has been around since at least the 90s.
---
There will be a cool down so it can’t be abused, and also a delay so you can’t avoid gankers
---
This is absolutely sad and it actually ruins a big chunk of vanilla aspects. We need the cities without layering. At least. I hope layering gets removed ASAP.
---
I'm gonna use that for all my abilities now
---
throwing beer bottles at guards again... good ol' Bartleby
---
ill add it in a bit for you :)
---
Funny how servers all had their own dialect. Like the timeless DM vs VC debate
---
You can't macro that sort of conditional (as far as I'm aware) but it should be fairly straightforward to code an event conditional (in an addon) that checks the combat log for the resist and then does the text message.
---
That's disgusting and depressing.
---
Entitlement isn't by default a bad thing, nor is expecting courtesy. I don't owe you your life or liberty, but we can both agree it would be bad for someone to take either and that the claim they should be respected is entitlement, correct? By the same principle, Asmongold and the other streamers don't *owe* the community anything, but the courteous and correct thing to do is to try to minimize the harm you cause to others while maximizing the good for yourself. If they want to tie the scales further in favor of themselves to the detriment of others then yes, they can do that. But there is an expectation they understand the community is a collection of independent actors as well making the same kind of decisions and should expect disgruntled responses like blacklisting, griefing, and general complaining. 
---
And, by your own logic, the aggrieved streamers can't complain about any of these things, because none of these people owe the streamers anything. It would be entitled and stupid not to respect the desires and decisions of others, right?
---
tl;dr: Expecting courtesy from streamers is stupid entitlement, but them wanting not to be griefed isn't according to people defending streamers.
---
Solid advice! Thanks for the input.
---
His own guild collapsed today after we saw that shit, there have been a lot of occasions of really vile behaviour in his guild which a lot of them were really apathetic about. We just took the good half and reformed without them.
---
Are you missing a /s or are you in another dimension where BfA has 5 million subs?
---
Lmao streamers arent going to be getting r14/13 unless they´re the kind of player who only does that.
---
Getting your mongoloid followers to premade together doesnt mean jack shit when all the hardcore nerds from private servers show up.
---
Not only cheaper, but actually manageable technically speaking. A dynamic, on the fly sharding like that is quite complex to set up, but sometimes you just reach the limits of whatever hardware you're running on, and that's the sane way to go.
---

Here's the audit log from the server, showing that steaks didn't delete his own discord.
---
Each new raid release is the "new hip thing". So, in other words, they will be there for the entirety of vanilla. And then when TBC is the "new hip thing", they will go there as well.
---
 **Please do not discriminate the Brazilian, we do not want another server, we want to play with you!**

---
Didn’t know you could eat in stealth.
---
aww thank you &lt;3
---
The capacity was much smaller than what it is today though
---
If you completely ruin someones ability to play the game, they probably would stop playing it atleast for a while.
---
Not that I would condone such actions.
---
The main problem is the level of reliance on layers completely obfuscates the picture. But it definitely seems clear that they intend to rely heavily on layers and less so on realm seperation.
---
You’re in luck! That’s every server!
---
In-game events (Fishing Event, the arena in STV) occur based on server time. Otherwise (and excluding datacentre location for ping) not really.
---
Good server choice.
---
The good thing about choices is they don't have to be optimal or "correct". You just need to make the choice then learn to live with it one way or another.
---
Imagine customers putting up demands from a billion dollar company. How dear we!

If you create a character with or without the same name as the stress test *on a different realm*, then it will have fresh settings as the settings are stored i to realm specific paths.

Yeah pretty dick way for him to put it man I agree

You can have fun living single with a minimum wage job. Given the way your views are it would seem you're content with just accepting whatever circumstance you're in and doing nothing about it so it's hard to imagine much better for you.

---
He isnt demanding anything you nitwit.
---
Hes saying that if streamers dont want to be bullied by a mob, dont livestream your location and actions.
---
They literally said exactly where they weren't going and everyone took it as "THEY'RE TELLING ***US*** WHERE TO PLAY!!?!"
---
Nah, you show a source for your claim, you argued in the affirmative, prove your affirmative. I'll get you started because I doubt you know the scaling of spirit off the top of your head. (no offense) 8 minutes is an extreme almost no fights are 8 minutes, and no fight will be 8 minutes unless it's progression, in which case I would still want the increased mana pool for several reasons, mana regen items can be used "sooner" with a larger mana pool, 300 more mana is 2.5 seconds sooner, and also increases your total pool for evocation, I think with those 2 things the spirit still nets you a loss.
---
Here is your stat page showing spirit scaling. They don't mention how frequently a "tick" of mana is, I believe it is every 2 seconds. You could just borrow the spirit values for BiS-preraid gear and show from there.
---

I am saying that is how you are actually using the word, instead of its actual meaning.
---
thats kinda fucked up. why are they special just because they have a following, all players should be on equal footing
---
Nah. You’ll probably need like 10 days of /played, which is 240 hours. So 17hours per day. No way to do that with a full time job.
---
You know that normal, and even hardcore GMs don't type like this, right?

"@everyone Hey. As you know, we expect you all to post a screenshot of a sub-6 hour level 15 before Tuesday to keep your spot. Good luck."

That's how you get the same exact message across, with the exact same consequences implied, without seeming like a cold narcissist.
---
How does being sensitive have anything to do with him mocking their name for not fitting into a model of image change...? I think you missed the joke champ.
---
Doesn't matter. People will be watching his stream expecting a Ragnaros kill and they will all leave because it can't happen for another week.
---
Not sure on why, but br was decided back in beta, especially as there were no oceanic servers.
---
Reverse psychology, my dude.
---
I have people to level with but we won't keep the same pace and I'm too impatient to wait.
---
'Member when it was just going to be sharding for the first zones at launch?

I used to, but then I got floaters which has made dark mode almost required for me

Seen this happen to a few discords for a few smaller games like wizard101 and such its always best to have a backup server setup and ready to swap to if anything like this happens
---
Do you agree then there should be no consequences for griefing streamers in particular, including stream sniping?
---
If that was true they wouldn't have any reason not to announce which server they are going on ahead of time.
---
THIS. It'd be the same if we had a bunch of servers with a pop cap of 3k.
---
Pissed normal people cannot meet the abnormal dedication of the fanboi battalion
---
It hasn't been an rpg in a long time
---
yeah, so you want to play a single player rpg in an mmo since it is easier and you don't have to deal with other people
---
Oh no, they can cry to the piles of money from streaming after not getting the exact names they wanted.
---
I swear the concept of cause and effect is completely lost on modern society.
---
keep reporting and thinking it will get fixed when it's like that by design lol
---
hey suddenly everyone on this sub is going for r14, scarab lord, thunderfury. We got a lot of pros here.
---
So I didn't know about the stereotype at all. All I knew was that players from certain servers seemed to be consistently awful.
---
Come to find out, those servers were Brazillian and Spanish speaking.
---
I’m starting a guild on Fairbanks (Horde) with a couple of friends from Vanilla. We plan on raiding Wed/Thurs 9:30pm PST until 12am PST. And by 9:30pm start, we start pulling mobs at 9:30pm PST. If you are interested, message me. If not, good luck!
---
Shadowmeld on top of stealth makes you harder to detect. That means you can get closer to your target and avoid detection or combat stealth-piercing abilities of others.
---
Such a little bitch haha
---
but they've got a blacklist!   /s
---
As I said already
---
&gt;GM chooses to run his guild how he wants. /r/classicwow cry about it.
---
A what now
---
lol. That boy be out of shape.
---
[Streamers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWAdB8IEb_o&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=104)
---
lol reddit server, 80% humans 10% nightelves 10% horde
---
You linked an opinion piece. I asked for an example of an MMO where such a thing was going on.
---
&gt;They won't do that because it would cost blizzard more money
---
Sure, having people to wait for 45 minutes before being able to play would cost heaps of money. In terms of lost subscriptions after a week, most definitely.
---
For real everyone is being unreasonable.
---
They've said what servers they won't play on, that's good enough for me
---
Yea, Im sure Asmon will be alone on his server, you and your 20 buddies are gonna hardcore camp him dude!
---
Better than many well thought out discussion threads, at least according to the mods.
---
more like a few months with only 3 east pvp servers lol
---
Agreed. I want sodapoppins classic wow experience to be ruined. I seriously dislike the self entitled wanker.
---
Streamers aren’t multi millionaires.
---
And it isn’t defending, it’s pointing out how entitled your acting. The only people being toxic are the ones making demands.
---
&gt;  A single big crit might drop the tank from half health to near zero or even dead.
---
I don't know what game you are playing but it's not WoW
---
There are both international/english speaking guilds and language specific guilds. The server language is english and this is how pugs usually communicate, generally you'll have no problem playing on an english realm. Of course there's a lot more diversity than on a German one.
---
&gt; Having them congregate on one realm and letting the rest know beforehand is everything you need.
---
It would be nice if they could actually fucking decide and announce then.
---
They've already said where they're NOT going, just play there
---
I played BC during launch.
---
I got out of school at 2:50 PM, went to work until 8, stayed up to 1030 getting in, played until 3am and enjoyed having a full, vibrant server.
---
I'd do it again now without a beat. 
---
Get this weak shit outta here.
---
You're joking with me right? Earlier there was a post about changing the display name of Classic on discord with half the comments saying "lol retail sucks I don't want people thinking I'm playing retail", as if it matters what random people on discord think about your gaming tastes. 
---
Now we got this trainwreck of a situation with streamers. Not all of it is necessarily the community's fault, but their reactions to all of this are pretty concerning to me.
---
Unless you're just joking with me here and I fell for it...
---
Blood Moon? I hope the rest of those (good) people are fine and I wish them the best. Good riddance!
---
We won initially, alliance came back with double the numbers later on. I started recording around then if anyone is interested.  [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/465438828](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/465438828)
---
Alliance on a normal server... Pitfall
---
ok
---
I would put money on Blizzard having a system that gives streamers early access to get their names.
---
What another stupid ass argument to make, you’re on a roll. Feel free to keep going, I won’t be reading them though.
---
100% this.
---
It's sad that you don't have anything better to care about
---
Support exists for a reason, mate.
---
Yep, we're doing great actually. We've created a great positive place and have been having a much better time already.
---
I think this is more of a bug but in the grand scheme of things this will probably only be a problem on launch the first couple of days.
---
Hello, if you are interested, I’m starting a guild with friends from vanilla on horde Fairbanks. We plan to start raid pullng at 9:30pm PST Wed/Thurs until 12am PST. If you are interested, feel free to message me, if not, then good luck!
---
Yes and no.
---
I don't understand why layering needs to exist at all in a capital city, so that makes me sad.
---
I do understand why layering should exist outside a capital city and in a starter zone. So that doesn't make me sad.
---
TL;DR I have no problems with the means. I have big problems with the execution.
---
At the moment all they will link you is opinion pieces like the one below. Its a vocal minority going around raging over streamers. Blizzard isn't about to ban streaming and the bulk of them will move on to games that provide them with higher viewership in short order.
---
Setting aside the cost for a moment (like you, I don't care about that), what exactly, from a player perspective, would be the alternative? 45 minutes queues as back in 2008? What a great experience indeed.
---
How dare you! Stream man BAD. Don’t pretend like they are human.
---
I don't disagree with anything you said. I still think streamers are free to shut you out of their circles, just as the anti-streamer community tries to do to streamers.
---
Entitlement IS negative. 
---
And saying they owe you nothing isn’t defending them. I’m trying to get through to you that you and those other people are acting like spoiled entitled twats.
---
The strawmen are strong. 
---
Answer is neither.
---
I'm in the same situation. I mained a Shaman in Vanilla through Wrath. When I came back from a long hiatus, the class just wasn't the same. I will be rolling Druid for classic, and I am very much looking forward to the Druid toolbox.
---
The bad reputation didn't really start until we got cross-realm grouping.
---
Blacklist streamers.
---
&gt;  earn some goodwill from the community at large
---
why? you guys promote them on this sub all day, drama makes classic wow work, and where will people watch the drama? on streams.
---
It is an extremely close recreation. People just know how to play and gear and so you can rush a bit more than before, but you’ll most likely have to CC stuff at fresh 60 with no gear
---
I have this feeling that the entirety of Classic, especially the release, is going to be filled with drama like this, and people will come to realize they will never be able to recreate the experience they had playing the original Classic.
---
Delusional? A little extreme. Have you looked outside this sub with regards to classic? Having conservative expectations for a game met with lukewarm appreciations outside of this subreddit is just being balanced and cautious about it. People could say the same thing but in the opposite direction... how butthurt and disappointed are the fanatic vanilla fanboys gonna be when in a years time, classic might be in serious decline? Are you going to then blame blizzard for not doing enough? Where does this really end? Just play the game and enjoy it. Or don’t. It’s up to you.
---
The sad thing is that those same “delusional” people would be extremely happy if that ends up being way more popular than expected. Ultimately we’re on the same side here but with different expectations.
---
But Ion literally said 'You have my promise' about that. It would be REALLY bad if they didn't follow through.
---
👍
---
They promote the game and bring in extra money. If the free walking advertisements want something as simple as their regular streamer name, they'll get it.
---
Yeah no consequences. Go ahead and try and camp Asmongold. Hell I have streamers on my team in league all the time. Stream sniping is to be expected.
---
He told you where he's not going to be, he went out of his way to do that. Can't you appreciate even that much?
---
That's what GW2 did at launch. It was called an overflow server. Thing is GW2's server and network infrastructure was built from the ground up with that tech in mind. It's hard to say whether nor not Blizzard could do that without a significant amount of time and by then it would be pointless.
---
Welcome to Maraudon or even as late game as Dire Maul. There are bosses that can do quite large crits. If the tank is in greens or maybe even some blues... might not have the health total nor mitigation to take them from half health.
---
Do you mean Fairbanks? 
---
In which case it's here; [https://discordapp.com/invite/RZBaJUV](https://discordapp.com/invite/RZBaJUV)
---
At least now they'll have better data to build a true private server
---
With layering factored in, each server will have like 50k players so good luck blacklisting anyone when 95% of the players won't know or care that someone got "blacklisted" by Sodapoppin. That was just a pathetic attempt of bluffing to discourage stupid people from stream sniping him.
---
ALL STREAMERS KILLED ON SIGHT IF THEY ROLL HEROD
---
Imagine being this autistic
---
Why do people spend so much time on someone they supposedly dislike?
---
Just follow a simple rule
---
Red = Dead
---
It's not a matter of being owed. You asked why would he do a thing, I gave you a reason why he could do the thing. 
---
Many on the server make a point to trash only Asmond and the like, expressing indifference or appreciation to many other streamers. They do still want to have an experience unimpeded by the ripple effects of major streamers being around and it is neither chill nor respectful toward the community to deny this opportunity to them for something as petty as spite or a brief lead on griefers who likely don't care about their name or have an extensive organization of friends and guildies they'd like to roll with.
---
What a fucking nerd.
---
This whole thread is full of people demanding streamers make a choice first and calling them names for not doing, so yes people are, read the room.
---
Wouldn't want you to expend much more energy thinking anyways. Seems you're at your limit.
---
Shit wrong name lol
---
Everyone on this sub needs to read this, then reread it.
---
Yeah have fun with the 30/70 split on fairbanks, goodluck with that
---
It’s only one server. So don’t play on it... crybaby
---
Statement was not mine. I just explained the scenario
---
He literally said socials exempt.
---
Whats the problem here?
---
I don't even like the guy but fuck me if someone is advertising for an elite guild and posts elite standards for the elite players then what the fuck is there to complain about?
---
where did they say this
---
This is such a bummer, was standing in orgrimmar baffled of how empty it was, then I started /who-ing people in the city and there were actually hundreds of people in the city :/
---
When the GM did a 10 hour run on stress test launch and he should lead by example, yeah it is.
---
My guild, Nightshift, will be raiding from 11pm PST on Thursday and Friday nights. That’s 2AM EST, so we’re later than most.
---
https://www.guilded.gg/r/EnGRq1wA6R?i=xAY39BGd
---
The playerbase is just consistently awful.
---
If you go into LFR and half the group is from Azralon and Ragnaros, you are in for a bad time.
---
Did they update the old armor in retail when they updated the models?
---
they do and have made changes before to bugs that got significant traction...?
---
Ok thank you!
---
 /s. I’m sorry I think you dropped this
---
 Could be you are not losing out on anything. I don't think it's unlikely they will have added more servers by launch or very shortly after. No names will be reserved for those.
---
 I'm going to reserve names but if they open up new servers that seems to be less crowded I will roll there even if I don't have names reserved for those.
---
 A name isn't really a big deal. Might seem like it at first but you get used to whatever name you end up picking sooner or later. For the stress test I picked a couple of stupid random names on the characters I tested. After 10 hours of playing I didn't really mind the new names that much.
---
Gatekeeping is when someone takes it upon themselves to decide who does or does not have access or rights to a community or identity when they are in no position to do so. In this case, the leader of a hardcore raiding guild is in exactly the position to decide what qualifications a member must meet to remain in.
---
I get why I just think it shows a lack of respect to the normal playerbase. What if theres like 3 guys who have no following and had the name asmongold before the streamer one even thought of it?
---
We would need at least 2 servers.
---
Not even the Brazillians want to play with the Spanish speaking community.
---
I apologize I should have edited I’m referring to NA primarily
---
wtf is "spergy"?
---
and the new servers haven't even opened yet lol, it's possible that they will say where they're playing before name reservation or before the actual start date
---
but all this drama is gold, jerry - gold!
---
Shazzrah is for snakes, golemagg is for big guys (for you)
---
I think it used to be available to choose in the macro icon list as well.
---
It was always a bad idea
---
It isn't the vanilla experience
---
IDK, anytime myself or others talked about it our threads were deleted or comments downvoted. My stress test made it abundantly clear that layering will kill classic. 10 people in stormwind btw.
---
You really only need to play 5h/day of pvp when getting from 9 to 10 though. Every other rank is pretty easy
---
Why not go old-school?: Notepad and Pen beside PC
---
Your previous comment proves otherwise.
---
The guy who want it opened a ticket and a GM took it away from soda and gave it to him. The GM only did this, because Soda's dumb ass filmed the entire rolling session. The produced the clip and the GM reviewed and gave him the glaive to the rightful guy.
---
I mean Brazil is literally on South America. While they might not speak the same language it makes way more sense then having them all go to NA servers.
---
TY you for the help and others giving me there opinion i decided to also make a alt at some point and make him go either  herbalism/mining or  herbalism /alchemy  ill prob have my main as eng/mining and make a herb alt so u need to do any end game content to get to recipes so i know if i have to gear him up a lot ty again for the help guys
---
This will end well. Get popcorn ready people.
---
People on this sub will find anything to complain about. If there aren't any actual issues, they'll invent one.
---
At this point I’m convinced that the stream man bad cesspool is full of whiny neckbeards that are going out of their way to be victims. The very existence of streamers is making them absolutely miserable. Demanding where they play? That’s not going to work. They’re not releasing their choice because petty assholes like yourselves will make it a point to take their names. They even listed both a west and east PVP server that they would 100% NOT be rolling on, but this self proclaimed martyr on the general forum made it a point to not choose one of those. Just to stir up drama. Yo it’s not 2004 anymore, get the fuck over it and play the damn game.
---
i feel like they are all going to take a different server so no matter what we have to deal with at least one of them.
---
goes two fold for you nerd, pretty sad that you want to be soda's unpaid internet pr team
---
My friend and I literally had this same conundrum today. A bag mod is basically the last piece of the UI puzzle for me, at least until ElvUI is ready and I have to redo everything.
---
She is dying and comes back to life in the future! THERE ! SPOILERS !
---
How so? Saying "Hey streamers, you can't play on this server! :)"
---
Is delusional
---
Zero chance Tips isn’t kicked from his own guild by Phase 3. Imagine how deluded you would have to be after never even leveling a character to 60 in vanilla or on pservers without being boosted, take the core of raid 2 from a mediocre raiding guild and think you are going to be competing for world firsts.
---
&gt;This is clearly just a bug that will be fixed before launch.
---
aahahhaha another blizzard drone? Layering issues have been getting posted (and deleted by mods) for months and blizzard havent fixed shit.
---
What do you expect? It's the internet,  land of monkey see monkey do. People will repeat the same shit all day lonv even if it makes them look like complete retards.
---
Literally don't throw them away then. You're gonna end up on the same server as a streamer, that's something you have to live with. Watch as it doesn't disrupt your classic experience in the slightest.
---
It's really not depending on your class. Monkeynews did something like 15 runs as a warrior, in addition to his previous runs he's basically at just shy of sub five hour.
---
To say sub six hour is "nothing" is a gross misrepresentation of the majority of the player base.
---
If he wasn't a streamer this would be a non issue. I don't really care for the streaming community but people here are going out of their way to find something to hate on.
---
The Twitch client definitely works for Classic, but the categorization for addons is a total shitshow right now. There's no separation between Classic and retail addons yet.
---
&gt;play BfA with the other 5 million subs.
---
LMFAO. 
---
How do you get on with your day to day life being that delusional?
---
I absolutely agree, except, layering will be a hurdle. It works out for streamers in that it takes extra effort to hunt them down even when you already know where they are. Especially as a solo player or small group.
---
If layering wasn't a thing, I have no doubt world pvp would be a living hell for the more popular/toxic streamers. Shit, joining a guild that hunts streamers as its focus sounds like fun.
---
It was more than likely an Addon. 
---
I think back in vanilla BossMod did this
---
It's a joke for fuck sake. You are all so goddamn ready to brandish your pitchforks like a mindless bunch of retards
---
My Dwarf Paladin had to go back to IF/Dun Morogh for the resurrection quest.
---
So, rights are negative? The desires to be able to live, be free, and have one's happiness be respected are negative? This is where we'll have to agree to disagree, Bat. 
---
The streamers are acting like spoiled entitled twats for considering their own experiences and choices to be more valid than those of others. They may believe they are entitled to the same freedom as others, but knowing it will cause harm to other players, which it undeniably will, undermines the equality of that entitlement and turns it into a freedom they retain, but is discourteous to exercise.
---
They are more likely to add more servers than fix layering.
---
We downed lvl 24 Ilkrud and minions and got the quest done
---
You´re replying to a single person and calling them entitled.
---
What the rest of the comment section contains, has nothing to do with it.
---
The worst part is that you try to sound smart with that retort in the end, which just makes you look like even more of an idiot.
---
You do realise we can re-read the comments right ?
---
What do you consider cheap basically any new pc Will be good enough.
---
Welcome to Classic! Somehow more fragile than the BFA fanbase. It'll be like this forever, every time the community can wind themselves up about a new issue.
---
I tried OmniCC for debuff durations, but it doesn't have that feature on Classic. Next thing I'm going to try is Raven.
---
Probably one of the few disease I want inside me.
---
Go into a computer shop. Throw a dart. Buy what it hits. It will run it well.
---
...but seriously the requirements are so low given the game's age that any cheap computer these days will be absolutely fine.
---
This dude didn’t even play Classic. He needs to relax, I’ve unfollowed all his socials. He’s literally the only streamer who does Classic that I cannot stand.
---
Ex-fucking-actly this. 
---
This is the same fucking whining that turned WoW into what most of us here hate. 
---
How long until the same people that lead oh so busy lives find it impossible to find a group and clear BRD. What then? More concessions?
---
It's not like people in fucking 2004 didn't have families or jobs. God damn.
---
Didn't he own/partner in an esports team?
---
FO' MO' YEARS!
---
I didn't just watch a clip.  I watched 10+ vids and tried his stream on multiple occasions.
---
You love to make assumptions that suit your argument.
---
Talk about blind.
---
A few ugly retarded poor russians with 3000 rubles per month were able to create a closer version of vanilla than blizzard. Just shows how far blizzard has fallen.
---
I do not understand the point of this post.
---
do you know a link where i can download it?
---
Idk, I was on the stress test and saw hundreds of people running around asmon blurting our twitch expressions and sayings right in front of me. I don’t want to hear Pog or pepega. Shit is disgusting. Even when he’s just on YouTube people are congregating around these players. I don’t hate the streamer - I hate the mindless sheep who would rather follow them around,  not play the game, and ruin it for everyone else.
---
How is this a better solution? You have 100K players invested in EU PvP 1 and 2, they'd have to reroll or die from congestion.
---
You guys are describing an world pvp event that sounds pretty epic tbh
---
I'm sorry, I'm daddy asmon's fan actually
---
Careful, they'll ban you for stuff like that here.
---
Just once? That happens all the time in retail. Half the time as it is being looted.
---
Autism at its finest.
---
This version of Vanilla has AH in all major cities.
---
I don’t like him either but this point is not good.
---
I agree that anyone who streams should accept the fact that they can get stream sniped. But I also think that anyone is allowed to do anything within their power to try and counter stream snipers.
---
Christ, don't get my hopes up. Anything to quarantine these mutants lol.
---
No I'm using its actually meaning. Thanks for checking I guess
---
Methadin Bronzebeard &lt;Terror of Azeroth&gt;
---
I guess you weren't around for the previous controversy and the reason streamers are hiding their server choice to begin with, eh? You're missing/ignoring why they're being looked at as entitled spoiled twats, to use your words. 
---
League is an entirely different environment and if you can't recognize that or the basic value of courtesy I'll just call you a lost cause and be on my way.
---
is that for real? i'm surprised a GM would step in there; people being shitty like this was just a part of the experience back in the day lol
---
i mean it's appropriate but i'm still surprised
---
This must be how Christians feel when they want to "save people from damnation". I feel for you my son :(
---
I foresee a lot of rp booty being plundered.
---
DM said by level 20 = Deadmines 
---
DM said by level 60 = Dire Maul.
---
This. Should be higher in the thread. The likelihood that the, probably, very large number of people on launch day stick with it is very low. Fewer servers at the start is better than several underpopulated servers later.
---
FFS this thread
---
&gt; but he didn't even play vanilla
---
And?
---
I don't understand why that is relevant to the issue here.
---
If he did does that make it better?
---
The other petitions worked out well. Hope the same happens for you guys here.
---
No
---
How many people know Asmongold as the streamer, and how many know Asmongold as the 3 random people with no following?
---
It's a pretty niche argument anyway as the names Asmongold and Sodapoppin etc are very rarely used by the playerbase except copycats, as can be seen in [the armory](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/search/character?q=asmongold). Not really worth worrying about unless you were hoping to snipe a streamers username.
---
Nah just roll a alt on that server and tank them.
---
It's a shame that the cringey part of the community decided to use Whitemane as their base.
---
That's not the way they tell the story!
---
Do you have this problem with other games/tasks? If so, just putting this out there, but it's one of many symptoms of ADHD.
---
My suggestion to you would be to schedule a time frame for play with your wife for after your kiddo heads to bed, maybe even picking nights of the week. Say, Tuesday &amp; Thursday 8pm until 11pm is WoW Time. Yeah, it's not a ton of time, but maybe you can work with your wife to get Sundays to have fun while taking over more around the house on Saturdays so she can do her thing.
---
I think a bit important thing is to talk to your wife about it. I HATE being interrupted and I hate it about anything I'm doing (even if it's a miserable task, 'cause it's still gotta get done and being interrupted means I'm getting delayed and I just want it over with). My husband can't stand when he announces food will be ready in X time and I'm not ready at that time. What I started doing (because my time management is decent but my ability to understand the concept of time is trash) is, say he gives me a half-hour head's up... I try to finish up what I'm doing and get to a Safe Place in-game to hide/wait.
---
I don't have any suggestions for dungeons, though. They're very long and you can't leave your groups hanging. You may have to chat with the wife about that, too; explain the time consuming aspect of it, that you enjoy doing it, but you don't want to let anyone down by leaving the group or not being available for her if she needs you; maybe you could try and 'schedule' dungeons with her, like at least a head's up that you're gonna wanna do SM or something and it might take 2.5-3 hours (overestimate ALWAYS and DO NOT do more dungeons in that time frame just because you finish early; prove to her you stick to your word or do better). 
---
Obviously I don't know your wife so I don't know if she 'gets' video games or not. I'm the one with the addictive personality in my marriage, and my hubby plays WoW too (used to be a heroic raider but is now very casual since he's a PM and works 12+ hour days) so it's easy for us to talk about/schedule these things. I took off the 27th through the 30th for Classic and he thinks it's silly but I let him go on cruises with his old college friend(s) without me and I explained that it's something I enjoy the way he enjoys cruises and I think he 'got' that. Give a little, take a little, you know? 
---
You could also ask her to 'step in' and say something if she feels like you're slipping into crazy sweaty nerdbro marathon-playing. If you're anything like me, time gets away from ya sometimes and it's hard to be aware of it unless you've got alarms set or something (which is another idea you should try when you play).
---
One more thought and I'll shut up, I promise! Have you considered playing a rogue, druid, or a night elf? Shadowmeld/stealth would be SUPER useful for the 'I'm questing but it's dinner in 2 minutes' issue! Just zoom to a quieter spot and stealth up!
---
I cant disagree with your arguments, but you dont seem to understand mine. Gaming nowadays is mainstream, everybody play videogames. 
---
Gaming(term didnt even exist) 15-20-30 years ago was enjoyed by a select few. The kind of people who played AD&amp;D, ate McDonalds almost daily and never ever tried playing football.
---
On the website you can
---
Body shaming so edgy.
---
I most likely won't be taking part in that. However, if we decide on an inofficial no-streamer server, they will have a bad time when they join only to find that the entire server wants them dead.
---
Couple hundred bucks?
---
If I had gold, you'd get it
---
Speak for yourself, i was saying these things and getting my post deleted and comments downvoted. Blizzard shills took over this subreddit post-launch date announcement and now its too late.
---
Flying isn't the only thing that killed WPvP.  Organized PvP contributed as well.
---
I kinda feel bad but for a whole year I remember we called a guy "butt sweat" in high school.
---
He couldn't even build a working doghouse for his dogs the other day.
---
The streamers?
---
The reason streamers are hiding their server choice is because of griefing. It stemmed from the stream sniping controversy in the Beta and seriously why else would they? To be petty, spiteful assholes to people who want to avoid them? That makes it worse, not better.
---
This is some r/wow worthy shit. Gtfoherewiththat.
---
cant wait for massive guilds to camp him, best of all he wont be able to roll horde haha
---
Flies attract to shit, so it checks out.
---
Did you guys not listen to the video? People are blacklisted for STREAM SNIPING. What’s the big deal?
---
Someone should make a massive guild specifically to gank streamers.
---
Download it from curseforge. Search for Weakauras2, press the "files" tab. Select the correct file. If you just press standard download button it will download the retail version. Good luck.

How are resto druids brand new 60 healing 5mans?  How is resto ability to farm jobs?

I'm stuck between paladin and druid. I played a lock late naxx patch and into TBC.  A prot  paladin in wotlk. My unusual work schedule prevents me from raiding competitively.
---
Definitely looking for a role that gets picked up faster for pugs and I have always had a desire to play druid.
---
End of Legion player here, questing for me was entirely just about skipping dialogue and running to quest objectives, aggroing a ton of enemies at a time and mashing through them as fast as possible.
---
Going into Classic I'm dying when soloing multiple enemies, I actually have to read quest text and have used sign posts on the side of roads to figure out where I'm going, and I've actually had a good reason to try and group with other players when questing.
---
It's like they respect me and aren't pulling punches even at starter levels, and its great.
---
Soy good
---
The idea of classic is to mimic original release.... phases should do this to the best of their ability.
---
There will be people who did not stream snipe and just happen to gank them when theyre angry and will get put on the list.
---
It will give them a better idea of how many are playing, while there is still time to add servers if needed.  Think it's a good idea for the cost of basically 1 week worth of sub time.
---
So he is solid middle management.
---
You are getting confused friend. Classic is not the game you are looking for. Please fuck off back to retail carebear edition.
---
Were you on EU? I swear I remember being a lowbie watching a lvl 60 solo the sewer monster back in the old days and asking that exact question.
---
In favor of horde?
---
Active racial is a big deal, though. Can coil + escape artist to get room for fear.
---
That's crazy enough to work!
---
Honestly I just remember kkkkkkkkkkk for laughing
---
And I didn't even save the details to avoid them in the future :(
---
Every guild should do that imo
---
I’ll be rolling horde here. Love the RP community.
---
People who want scarab lord should go on any of the pve servers.. hot damn so few people by comparison planning on them.
---
Hahaha 
---
that interaction was gold, being aware of the meme
---
The only one looking like an idiot is you.
---
Or just let them play wherever they want, who the hell are you to tell anyone what they should do?
---
Method
---
You are correct, but this is merely a reference to the original release of the game. At the start, there were only auction houses in Ironforge, Orgrimmar, and Everlook. They did get added later in vanilla, but there originally were only those three.
---
I've seen a lot of people today on the stress test saying "Oh yes! They real auction house!" when they see the one in Stormwind, but I would just be thinking to myself "Yeah, but we used to only have it in IF!"
---
So I made the meme.
---
CSS, CSGO, WoW, GW2, Planetside, LoL, UO private shards. All games I've played over the last two decades where BR's have absolutely stood out as dipshits, trolls, toxic, etc. 
---
I've effectively had hundreds, if not thousands of gaming sessions adversely impacted by Brazilian assholes. Do they exist from other cultures? Oh my god yes. But it's not a near unanimous experience. I've met maybe 3 identifiable BR players in 20 years that weren't assholes and were worth dealing with multiple times. I'm sure I've had positive experiences with plenty of others that weren't obviously Brazilian, and that's how it should be. The problem is that a lot of BR players let you know they're BR while being douchebags.
---
If you care about this shit you really need to get laid.
---
He is overreacting because he has to put on a show. The real shithead is the one who gave him the glaive.
---
No, I didn't.  Why, do you really think classic is going to bring in record numbers and sustain them?  It's not 2004 anymore.
---
Local boomer yells at cloud
---
Is this the part where like a whole 500 people decide to boycott this and then claim it's the reason 90 percent of the population is gone within 6 months?
---
The people who are to blame, without a shadow of a doubt, are the people who went absolutely full sperg over sharding. That directly led to Blizzard trying to find a compromise, and this horseshit layering situation is the result. 
---
Sharding in low-level zones only is the only good solution, but people freaked out and this is what we got. Probably too late to fix it now.
---
Nah, there are some good classic streamers. Madseasonshow is like the antithesis of Asmon
---
Ok, go back to Asmongold's stream and give him a few bucks. Maybe he'll even say your name!
---
Seek professional help.
---
This reddit is still apparently full of that kind
---
That's awesome. I guess I have some unfounded fears if time zones. :)

Or it would just take like 30 minutes of running to aszshara to refill and getting summoned back...

---
All about the Chapeau.
---
I’m saying that suggesting any changes for this shit is stupid. But if Blizzard were to cater to anyone it would most logically be the streamers. There is no arguing against it, they are free advertisement, and they pretty much require nothing. So they wouldn’t have to do anything to placate streamers besides maybe post their twitch on the battle.net launcher or raid them on twitch or some shit.
---
Never donated to a single streamer in my life. But hey, nice attempt at trying to save face.
---
Not as nice as yours.  I was in the orc starting area, finishing the quest inside the cave where you need to kill the little mini boss.  It was my second toon, so I kind of knew it was going to be hard...but I was a loc so had the pet.
---
Get there and there is a guy, hunter maybe, kind of racing me...I assume to get to the end guy first.  I invite when we are almost there, and he dosn't accept.  So I sit off to the side, as I know he can't do it solo.  He see's that he'll get the add etc and turns to me and invites.  I don't accept, sit down and wait.  Watch him kind of hem and haw for a bit then try it.  Wait until he dies, take the mob, and leave knowing that he is now at the xroads spawn with a long confusing walk back and no way to rez.
---
At the time I felt like it was quite clever, and getting revenge for all the people stealing "my" bores/imps/etc...but after a min or two it hit me that he probably didn't know the area/game and probably wasn't trying to screw me out of the quest kill....and I was the jerk.  That was back near the original launch...maybe 2nd or 3rd day.  :(
---
Not until shit works lol.
---
Except tipsout himself can even get close lol. I managed 7 hours on a warrior and was pretty happy with that. Imagine your guild master (who had 10hours played OMEGALUL) demanding you have sub 6.
---
I approve.
---
They are not just trying to have an innocent fun time. At least 1 in the four pvp servers will be completely unplayable to us.
---
Am I doing it right xD

&gt; [Nobody knows what the population of an individual layer will be](https://youtu.be/O3b423uqrdo?t=429)
---
It shows how layering is affecting the sense of realm community is areas where it's not needed.
---
That's ok, there will be more than enough non-trolls begging for money to respec that you'll be drowned out lol.
---
Years of Dota2 has ruined my perception of non-english speakers.
---
Eastern europeans, pinnoys and south americans.
---
It's coming from the fact that, using any reasonable estimate for player population, 85%+ of the playerbase will have to stop playing by phase 2 in order for them to remove layering and have a regular population on the 10 or so servers they are hosting.
---
Player
---
I totally agree and I'd resent playing on a streamer server. 
---
It's not really a concern for me cause I'm playing on the german pvp server and there are no big wow classic streamers around.
---
Anyways, I just wanted to put it this way:
---
Just wait till they announce their server and avoid them if you want to.
---
But trying to tell them: This is our server, you're not allowed to roll here! is kinda childish and in no way do they have to give any damn about it. It would probably lead to them picking that server out of spite which, to be honest, I could understand.
---
I didn't realize Soda has been around so long.  He was an annoying twat then too.
---
All we ask for is one server that has no (or very few) servers. We have 4 pvp servers. If the big streamers spread themselves across all four servers, every server would be a streamer server.
---
as someone who have been playing on those private servers for years, the only time what you described ever happened was on fresh launches. And for good reasons. Fun later when you're with your guild killing world bosses, then suddenly they all dissappear.
---
He looks and acts like a 15-year-old spoiled child even though he's about a decade older than that
---
Why?
---
If you aren't a huge fan of the NE start zones anyway, then you might as well do the run first thing. You'll ding 2 on the way and pick up some flight paths. And I'm not kidding, when the zones are crowded and it starts taking 20-30 minutes just to tag quest mobs for your starting quests (or any mobs to grind), it's really nice not to be where hunters start out. They have a massive advantage for tagging mobs. It also gives you a greater variety of classes to group with. I'm partial to Coldridge because dorfs, but I'm rolling druid and the human start zones are the simplest and--again--it really is nice not to have as many hunters from 1-4.

Here, you can just read the comments yourself if this is so difficult for you https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/comixw/north_american_eastern_pvp_is_claiming_herod_as/ewkalex/
---
I mean there’s a lot of factors as to what ‘killed’ retail wow. But I agree, layering/sharing do suck. It’s existence is to help us at first and be removed once it’s no longer needed. I’ll be just as peeved as everyone else if it’s still around after phase one. That being said, the first couple months of play would blow if there were 10k players trying to do the same quests
---
Lol same
---
Source on that? I don’t recall that being accurate
---
What split?
---
Lmao it's like a gazelle saying to a lion, "i will stay here this is our water spot we don't want lions drinking here", well it's well known fact that gazelle aren't the ones calling the shot, if u want to avoid you will have to wait =)
---
That worked!
---
Thanks man! Do you happen to know if the settings i save in beta will save for classic release?
---
If you are basing your “facts”, which is just random bullshit until you link me a source, on how easy it is to get gear then that’s just sad. It really describes how barebones retail is. There’s been M+ in the game for almost 4 years now and subs are still dropping. Have you ever thought about why the game was more popular when there was less content? 
---
If you think it’s because of gear, I’m sorry you sold your brain cells for wow time.
---
Yeah, it’s weird everyone’s saying “while streaming gives you all this power and shit, you should expect to be ganked” but no one seems to say “you should be allowed to use that power to combat this situation so you can actually have fun. People keep forgetting the streamers are playing the game to have a good time, just like the rest of us.
---
What
---
I'm very much looking forward to going back to the next level and mind controlling the other faction to buff and heal them. That shit was super fun.
---
Exactly this.
---
I wouldn’t go as far to say inbreads, but it was definitely children under the age of 16. 
---
They have no context as to how good this game used to be back in the day. And they grew up in a period of just complete MMO filth. 
---
They don’t understand. And it looks like Blizzard is just going to pander to them.
---
Wasn't dynamic spawn always a thing?
---
People are concerned about their huge fanbases following them around. Their is a video on avoidstreamers.com if you want to watch it
---
Ah gotcha
---
I had over 1h queue, ultra fast dynamic respawns with some mobs spawning as they died and an empty layered world ;( I'm happy for classic but it feels like a bummer.
---
It was where I started back in 2004 and I think it's a major part of why the game struck me so profoundly.
---
I'm fine if they just convert their jajajajajas
---
Here's mine. [https://imgur.com/a/HIQ85Kg](https://imgur.com/a/HIQ85Kg) (hope that works, I don't use imgur often lol...)
---
How is MRP working so far? I usually use an RP addon too, but I'll probably wait to mess with it until a couple of weeks into the game at least.
---
Starting zone monsters are weaker than normal, they don't even have parry or dodge if I remember correctly.
---
Lmao "in character" and "persona" are such fucking joke cop outs. If you're acting like an asshole, you're a fucking asshole, there's no two ways about it. They aren't actors in a movie, they're real people, interacting with other real people, and like you said, influencing the behavior and experience of real people. I'm so fuckin tired of that "it's just a persona" horseshit.
---
Saying they won't go to the unofficial Brazilian server doesn't really count. I give them credit for at least announcing Fairbanks as streamer free, but still think they're being inconsiderate for not announcing and expecting people to be happy with the concession of one server. 
---
But hey, feel free to ignore context while insulting other people and defending asshole behavior.
---
It doesn't matter in the eyes of the GMs back than. The GM guidelines, as was stayed long ago, that en-game arrangements are binding. This includes the rolling system.
---
“A correction that is really simple but yet somehow still manages to be too difficult for you.
---
“
---
How ironic that you say that, when your the one who jumped into a random comment chain and started attacking people out of the blue without understanding anything.
---
Whitemane thicc
---
In 5 lines of text I made a negative point about streamers twice while mentioning no positives. 
---
I just pointed out some faulty logic.
---
Dno how that counts as deep throating streamer.
---
Gotta suck to be so pent up with anger :(
---
What kind of bullshit logic is this? I have the freedom to make any fucking demands I want. If Blizzard decide to meet them is another question, but they sure has hell won't fucking improve anything if we stay silent. 
---
The retarded management at Blizzard has made too many mistakes to count the last years, they need to get the message hammered into their faces.
---
This is a certain bait once the naxx phase comes around.  Gonna be so many people feeding trolls with that one. "WRATH BABY IDIOT!"
---
When will people learn? lol
---
Did that really happen? I find it hard to believe a GM would step in and redistribute loot like that. I guess it's possible, I have been away from wow for a long time. Still, that just seems insane to me.
---
Ye, looks like a very minimal damage increase, you lose a really tiny amount of crit and a little bit of mana. I just really prefer to be a human over a gnome)
---
Ty for the answer!
---
The only obnoxious losers that don't shut up are the people complaining about where the streamers are going to be. I've not seen a single person in 6 months say "I hope the streamers announce what server they will be playing on so that I can play with them" but all the boomers that want to avoid streamers have the incessant need to complain about it every fucking day, like it's the end of the world that their server will have a higher population. Ironically it's the same people that complain about how retail doesn't have community events anymore, who complain about they want to avoid streamers that are forming community events.
---
To the boomers reading this post, sorry you had to get your reading glasses, ill make sure i type my chuck norris jokes in all caps for you to read easier when we're in the barrens :)
---
Of course it is him doing this. While the other streamers try and organize because they can understand, he has to thoughtlessly hold out like he is making some kind of stand. Almost as if he is as toxic as his community....whoda thunk?
---
explaining the meme weirdchamp
---
The addon; Tank Buddy did that
---
&gt;People are only allowed to have fun if I also think it's fun, otherwise they are cancer
---
could buy a used laptop on kijiji or craigslist for $50-100 that would probably run it on high lol
---
How old are you? And more importantly - did you actually play in the real classic?
---
No idea sorry
---
I can tell you didnt read your own comment and cant remember it if you try that reply.
---
Good luck with whatever future endeavours you have, you clearly need it.
---
Ah yes, the tourists. Should we guess how many they are?
---
It there job to honor in-game arrangements, because those arrangements were binding back then. Probably still are today. The roll system was put into the game for this very reason.
---
I wasn’t happy with what pservers offered. Wasn’t all I ever wanted. Some people didn’t think they were that accurate.  A blizzard sanctioned and coded vanilla is what I wanted.
---
Pretty much. It's not hard to figure out lol. I'll take VC or DM though for mines.
---
Hahaha
---
Wouldn't it be smarter to merge "dead" servers as to not ruin the groups of people that have already chosen a home and created bonds?
---
Guess what the answer to that problem is, smartass: you cast your biggest heal and cancel the cast if the tank isn't low.
---
I love this meme, regardless whats in the bubbles
---
If hunters didn't have to come to town to reload then they'd be level 60 while the next highest class not being multi boxed is 25
---
Apparently YOU didn’t. I know what I typed. But what ever. Trolls like you always try to get the last comment and try to act superior.
---
I think you knew what I meant
---
Pretending it's not an issue through layering is a worse sign because you're actively hurting the people playing.
---
Except the fact that asmongold, basically tied for the biggest one, said he won't announce it until release and he doesn't care about other peoples' feelings on it. He started the drama, not us.
---
&gt; I have to misrepresent people's stances because I'm incapable of evaluating a situation fairly with my small mind
---
Yeah either works but it's not hard to figure out.
---
Do you have a proof for that
---
I am not a fan of layering at all and don’t want it but I can see blizzard only going to keep layering in the starting zones for a month and than get rid of them hopefully
---
I thought you may have been able to see reason. Listen, shithead; I'm trying to help you understand how retarded you are.
---
If there's 14,000 guilds clearing a raid in BfA after 6 months and there's 17,000 guilds that cleared a raid after 14 months in WoD when we knew the subs were at 5.6 million, then the subs aren't going to be drastically different.
---
There's more to do now than there was in WoD. It doesn't make a fucking difference if YOU think the shit we have now sucks. There's more to do, less people are funneled into raiding than they were in WoD. It is fucking implausible that BfA has a significantly lower sub count than WoD did.
---
He's such a whiny little bitch my brother would watch him all the time I learned way more about this spoiled loser than I ever wanted to know

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5hg-hZwC_Y
---
Because chance is a crybaby and 100% he's A. going to just call everyone who ganks him a stream sniper, and B. tell people to blacklist for whatever other reason he feels like at the time lol.
---
Besides years of experience and months of recent practice on our server? I guess this will do: https://www.engadget.com/2014/08/26/wow-archivist-the-classic-molten-core-experience-part-2/
---
We spent a good chunk of time on Horde guild's TS and Vent servers so we could do BGs against each other after raids or for coordinating the AQ war effort, and so on. I knew some of the Horde players better than I knew a lot of Alliance players. 
---
We were on a PvE server, so we also had a policy of first to WB gets  first go, and if they wipe, the next gets a go etc. but sometimes they'd let us know it was up and they weren't going for it and so on.
---
The reason it's fucking stupid is that anyone who's truly tryharding at launch has time off lined up so getting to 15 in under 6 hours doesn't matter when you don't have to work. You could still devote on average way more than most people per day and still get to 60 before them, even before someone who gets more xp per hour than you so long as you put in more hours. What tips out is asking for is some speedleveling bullshit that doesn't actually matter.
---
It's impossible to prove. He'll just do it any time he gets ganked.
---
They’ve said many things “for certain” over the years, and then gone back on them.
---
Remember when they said classic wow wasn’t gonna happen, perhaps?
---
Layering isn’t going anywhere, but they’re not gonna let people know until they’ve sunk 2-3 months into the content. At that point people will be used to it anyways, and only a small fraction will quit. If they announced layering was permanent now, people wouldn’t start playing in the first place.
---
people still don't think bears can tank. I joined a guild's recruitment discord and basically told me i have to go resto or dont expect to tank anything after BRD...
---
Blizzard is literally out to get me and ruin my nostalgic memories by DESTROYING the game I loved and shATTERING IT'S COMMUNITY
---
I have no obligation to be nice to people and respect them and put myself in their shoes, but I do it anyway cause I’m a decent human being. Cool it with the whiteknighting.
---
youre not understanding my point. it's not about who knows who or copycats
---
Heck, even niceguy Esfand uses "sperg" as a pejorative (though typically in a self-deprecating manner).
---
Why is that, if I may ask?
---
I don't need to know where they play. I just need to know where they won't play. One server is for the Brazilians, one is for the Spanish. That leaves two servers. Maybe I'll just learn Portuguese.
---
And the EST server got claimed by the Brazilians so that leaves those of us wanting to play on an EST server a 50/50 chance of ending up with streamers. They just need to announce and be done with it.
---
Lol.
---
Oh yeah. I’m sure your RAGE is a better way to get your point across. 
---
Stay mad.
---
There's a guy on old-school RuneScape who does PVP montages of just killing streamers. He then clips their reactions in his video. It's really good. Easy views/subscribers to anyone that does this on wow classic.
---
Fair enough, we’ll see.
---
If Blizzard were to cater to anyone it would be the majority, not the individual. 
---
They are clearly not an attraction to a large number of long term players and potential customers, instead a repellant. That they are net positive advertisement is actually a debatable claim. 
---
Your grammar and points break down after this and I don't follow your arguments, nor understand the relevance to the particular nit I was picking.
---
PvE you have to flag to be able to be attacked by the opposing faction in the world. In a PvP server you're always open to enemy attack and vice versa.
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/23090134/wow-classic-primer-for-new-players
---
If you don't want to be on a server with streamers you need to wait until they've picked theirs and hope a new server opens up if all servers are taken by the big ones, which is likely.
---
It isn’t asshole behavior to not tell you where they will play. And I’m not ignoring context. Context is why I’m saying people are acting entitled. 
---
You are literally calling streamers inconsiderate, entitled, and assholes for not telling you where they are playing yet, when they may not even know themselves(Which seems to be the case). They are under no obligation to do anything for you, and there are a few trying to help by saying they won’t go to X. Yet for you that’s not good enough. 
---
This is why I said you guys are acting entitled.
---
The streamers are nothing without their community. I watch a lot of these streamers, I don't hate them at all. But I don't want them in my main server at all. I'll have an alt that I play on their servers even.
---
Wanting to play the game free from mass influence isn't "lacking self awareness". It's wanting to play the game on my terms and not on the terms of someone else. 
---
You're literally just a brown-noser for these guys and validating their shitty behavior on this issue.
---
They aren't "doing anything for_me_ " by announcing their server. They are doing it for their community, you know, the ones that pay their bills, support them, and give them an audience to begin with.
---
get your dumbass mods to stop wiping layering and server number threads
---
This makes me think of another downside I hadn't thought of previously... What about killing faction leaders, its no longer impactful when you can just get into a layer where they are still alive. 
---
It was something fun, even if a bit rare, to see your faction leaders dead when you need a buff or to turn in a quest on an alt, it makes you hate the other faction that much more and want revenge, now its a small annoyance you can get around easily.
---
Totally know how you feel. I started in late TBC and then played more seriously in WotLK+ which was my favourite time playing WoW, but when I played the Classic stress test for a few hours, I was hooked. The world felt magical, immersive, meaningful and the progression and pace is so rewarding, as well as the social aspect. 
---
I spent hours running around naked with a group of about 10-20 players, exploring and killing Hogger, then we created a guild called &lt;Naked Crusade&gt; and stood outside of Stormwind recruiting explorers to our naked cause. It was epic. Also, seeing the original Stormwind Park for the first time in-game felt absolutely awesome and eerie.
---
Are chats layered too? Or server wife?
---
Reddit is the minority dude.
---
Right under the vent server info in the guild notes
---
Idiot
---
And that’s how you ruin classic for people ladies and gentlemen.
---
Unless you want the names Arthas, Legolas, Kvothe, etc you'll probably be able to choose your name even if you wait until september.
---
"Haha, here is why the jokes funny guys"
---
GMs would always step in on shit like this when there was bullet proof evidence. I had a few items ninja'd but had put very clearly in the chat the rules and the person who ninja'd the item agreed to abide by the rules (/roll wins etc) so they acted on the chat log they had. Video evidence like this is even more damning lol.  They just wouldn't get involved in a he said she said case because then they're just making a coin flip decision and are probably wrong.

Yeah that’s not a good look for him, warrior is different but pretty much every other class can get sub 6 with a solid route and even with some mistakes
---
That was made in 2014 and doesn’t have an actual source, it’s a blog post. 
---
Your “recent server” may have it working incorrectly. Or the private servers i played in bad it incorrectly. However, I’ve never heard of a week long cooldown and if you go to the wowhead page for aqual quintessence, someone in a later expansion states that it was faster to summon to azshara and back than using the eternal version.
---
Guess we’ll see in a few weeks how it works
---
Why dont you guys call it by its real name. Sharding. Yall got brainwashed by blizzard marketing team. Call it a new name they will never know.
---
While that's true, I fundamentally believe that gameplay should always be prioritized when making such decisions. Design the game, then find out how to implement it on a technical level, not the other way around.
---
You are doing the same thing.  Go jump in a hole.
---
Yeah not sure how the wallpaper originally posted is so clean yet the individual ones he linked are so choppy.
---
no u.
---
There’s 3 server choices.  There will be people spamming streamer names on each of them.  It’s irrelevant tho since they already have a deal with Blizzard to allow them to reserve their names well before normal players are able to get in and reserve their names.

That’s my guilds plans. If we kill the streamers every chance we get, their stream will be super boring cuz of corpse run all day. I have 25 natural born killers ready to get some streamer!
---
!RemindMe 6 months

Imagine gatekeeping whether someone plays PvP or PvE servers. It's not their fault you were shit at fortnite and call of duty so you ended up PvPing in WoW instead like it's some crazy feat of courage and skill
---
Would it be bad to go Alliance on Pagle then?  I thought I remember not being able to get a bg queue pop when my server was imbalanced in wrath

If you don't want to get stream sniped, maybe put a delay on your steam? That feature is there for a reason. But no they have to interact with their chat that's really just meme spam.

You mean like how we wanted authentic spell batching instead of this scuffed artificial lag that they have instead? I know it's so hard for rotbrains like you to get the facts right.
---
It's not out of the question the community could make a toon guild specifically for this. I'm down to clown around

This fucking subreddit Jesus Christ streamers aren’t entitled to give you jack shit just like you aren’t entitled to give streamers anything. If you’re such a whiny boomer then go play on the server that they specifically announced they ARENT going to play on.

They did that in vanilla all the time as long as you had the in game chat log or the like where they could confirm 100% everyone involved in the roll knew and agreed upon the loot rules.  That's why it was important to type in chat shit like "ok rolling for X, highest /roll wins. everyone agree?" and have everyone put Yes etc in chat for shit like that.  Obviously random dungeon loot mostly who cares but legendary shit and other super rare stuff it was always a good idea. Not sure what the policy will be this time around or what it currently is though. (I guess they probably don't even have a policy for retail at this point since it's all personal loot v0v)
---
PvE - you are not forced to flag for PvP in contested zones, only in enemy capitals.
---
PvP - you will be flagged when you enter contested zones and enemy capitals.
---
Are you guys both right here? If I'm reading correctly if you reach revered with the waterlords the Quintessence becomes non-consumable and is on an hour CD :)
---
He's basically a powerless Kylo Ren with the way he throws temper tantrums. I can't imagine acting like that at all, ever, for any reason. Most streamers I can at least watch and enjoy for a bit, but I can't stand soda.
---
It's pyrewood. If they roll on golemagg they'll have a bad time because that's where apes are rolling.
---
looks like I'm going to have to wait until this is removed before buying this game, they're taking the MMO out of the RPG here - which is weird considering the game has already been made for them, and they've still found a way to sabotage it

This sub and classic WoW forums have been a cesspit since the beginning.

---
I thought that this was  a TBC addition.
---
Yes, the Eternal Quintessence was added in 1.11 and can be used once per hour. But no one is reaching Revered in time for a week one or week two MC clear.
---
Damn thats nice UI. Can you share your mod list?
---
PVP: You're always open for PVP business meaning people can kill you or harass you when you're out in the world with or without your consent.
---
Considering the nature of "Warcraft" most players consider PVP to be the de-facto "real way" to play the game, since you're constantly in danger from players on the opposing faction.
---
PVE: World PVP basically doesn't exist. You *can* flag yourself available for PVP and only other people flagged available can attack you. But honestly most people wont ever do it because they play on a PVE server *not* to get attacked. You can still fight the enemy faction in Battlegrounds but not in the open world losing a element of surprise/dynamic situations happening or any reason to be afraid of the enemy faction in a contested territory for that matter.
---
If you ask me, PVP is the *true* WOW experience and it's really not such a problem or frustration that you'll likely rarely feel the desire to "switch off PVP".
---
You don't get to demand nor are you entitled to know where they won't play.
---
This is why a lot of Eve Online streamers stream with a delay. Even a few minutes is fine for the most part. Complaining about stream sniping is pretty much bs because it's 100% avoidable even still streaming, much less just not streaming what you don't want sniped.
---
This is exactly what an armchair gaming network admin would say

---
Agreed, but there is a solution built into the system yet the streamers still complain when people snipe them. You don't get to blatantly ignore the perfect system to avoid what's stressing you and also complain about it still happening.
---
Has anyone cared about wow rankings in the past 10 years?
---
We have actual competitive games now. Getting glad in wow takes the “skill” of getting gold 5 in league of legends. I’ve done both
---
i can't believe how toxic this community already is and the game isn't even out yet. i get that people don't want to play on streamer servers but holy shit.
---
This is at least an upside of there being so few servers, not enough servers to choose from for there to be faction servers.
---
And now you're super sensitive to someone else being sensitive to the 1st person being sensitive.
---
See how retarded this argument gets? 
---
(offensive word included on purpose to continue the 'sensy-train')
---
To be fair, this is not how the game was either designed or implemented in the first place. Remember those waiting queues to enter a server while other servers were slowly dying? Layering, while not perfect, is a huge improvement.
---
Yeah, because a 24-hour old Reddit survey is a representative sample of the population that will be playing. Don't be dumb.
---
Only 65 likes??? I love it thank you
---
They've done this before. Vanilla WoW and the subsequent expansions were ***littered*** with servers that were ghost towns. 
---
It's time consuming, a hassle and very disruptive (for players) to have to merge servers together because one of them is practically vacant. 
---
Blizzard is looking for the Long Term, not the temporary.
---
Sign me the fuck up
---
We're just roleplaying - something Oceanic players don't get to do. ;-)
---
People like you don't seem to understand to underlying issue here. Yeah, the servers can hold more did to layering... Are you forgetting the plan is layering is meant to be completely disabled after a few weeks? Blizzard expects loads of people to drop off the game apparently. If they don't, you're gonna have 10k+ level 60s running around. If they add servers later, well you just cleaved established communities. They are set up for failure.
---
What a piece of shit. Power trip much?
---
&gt;You don't care about them doing a cost reduction strat at the cost of gameplay?
---
That's not my point, sorry, poor phrasing. I don't care their cost, that shouldn't affect the gameplay. Which is probably in line with what you're thinking.
---
&gt;I had over an hour during the stress test.
---
Yeah I mean that's hardly reflective of reality. This is, as the name tells, a test. By definition, the environment needs to be constrained, to have meaningful results.

Look for the guild Friends Against Goldmining on Herod.

Good post 100% agree sadly a lot of people on this subreddit seem kinda braindead

You could pick one of 3. One from each game. Starcraft, WOW, and Diablo.  
---
But yeah. I know some of the cats were in. Owls in Darnassas. The damn OOX chicken.
---
(((Asmongold)))?
---
Sure but thats more speculative than actually going with what has officially been stated and repeated by blizz. So thats the conversation we should have. We can have your point in the back of our head ofc but its not what we can argue and talk around when itd be speculative at best.
---
Seems like a nice enough guy just didn’t find him entertaining. Might give him another shot. Kevin Jordan, Joanna, and Payo are the only others I follow presently.
---
No but those are some of the most prominent lore characters whereas the classic ones are all very minor so it feels lame. Don’t think it’s that hard to understand.
---
Agreed, if only they would add some servers without layering I know myself and a million others would jump on them in a heartbeat. Sad to say it prob won't happen - we're likely the victims of some corporate infighting.
---

doesnt matter if it fucking offends you or not. plenty of people with actual autistic relatives will be offended by it. shits not about what you think.
---
We can't got blacklisted irl.
---
How do you merge realms with characters with the same name? Guilds with the same name? Auctions? Raid lockouts? What if people don’t want to move and prefer their server name? What if merging causes huge faction imbalance on a PvP realm?
---
You’re right. I forgot 6.2 was the last patch WoD had for over a year.
---
Really for an RP-PvP realm we should have got Bloodsail Buccaneers.
---
Oh well, this'll do.
---
I am from Quelthalas (SA server) and I want play classic in a good place...

"Haha, like litteraly"

Shh, we're supposed to be circlejerking and screeching, not being reasonable.
---
At this rate I doubt it'll be fixed at launch, but this obviously isn't how it's supposed to work. People love a good riot tho

---
I have no need to join the stress test. All of the addons and settings will take a couple of minutes to set up. Not to mention it’s not even needed right off the bat. People are just addicts fiending for a fix lol
---
Yes because server splits with character transfers have always been so effective before... They're significantly more disruptive than server merges yet people act like it's worth it to risk having to split servers to avoid the risk of server merges.
---
Yikes
---
How can anyone listen to this guy? i'd rather punch myself in the dick while chanting the lord's prayer than continue hearing his voice.

Why do people want to go to Herod instead of Faerlina?

is it just the name?
---
Tipsout is garbage in wow too so its funny
---
I didn't have any issues during tbc launch.
---
I love the sense of realm pride that is already starting to show.
---
God this argument is so bad and I hate seeing it pop up all the time. 
---
The main reasons you watch streamers.
---
A) The streamer is good at what they do. You go to them to see them perform or to learn how to better yourself at the game.
---
See: Tarzaned, Pantsaredragon, SKT Faker, Dyrus, Tyler1, Mikepreachwow
---
B) The streamer is entertaining. Usually these guys can do a variety of games because your there for personality.
---
See: Tyler1, Dr. Disrespect, Azmonbald (I guess? I don’t actually watch him aside from a random rant), Hashinshin, Trick2g
---
C) You’re taking a shit and someone told you to watch the Humonculus known as Tyler1.
---
It's the ultimate big brain play. If enough people quit due to layering, they won't need to layer anymore.
---
Oi m8 where me fockin mates
---
And did you move? I didn’t. Players are always going to pick high pop over low pop!
---
Dude there are numerous people in asmons stream who have literally every mount in retail wow. You have no chance mate
---
As an EU player I feel like I am missing out on this whole war against streamers. Still is kind of fun to spectate.
---
Come check out the discord;
---
faerlina.classicdiscord.net
---
Well, there is plenty of love and dedication put into indie games, hollow knight, factorio... as far as AAA games go Sekiro.  
---
Layering is sharding 1.1. I’m sure plenty of people would prefer lack of that than rp pvp servers,  languages, etc. this is a huge chance and as you can see on the very examples on this subreddit - it works like shit and blizzard haven’t done much to fix that for loooong time
---
&gt; but it's like a matter of pride to be toxic and terrible at the game for them for whatever reason.
---
no trolls whatsoever on NA league of legends/dota servers amirite?
---
Keep in mind that Horde Rogues have to deal with the billion Humans running around with Perception, and Dwarves dispelling Blind w/ Stoneform.  You're pretty much always going to lose to a Human or Dwarf Rogue.
---

---
You mean is planning on removing once we hit phase 2?  It is a temporary solution to mitigate the worst parts of an MMO launch.  I would rather have this than be unable to play for who knows how long at launch.
---
Personally, I'd love if they were given the opportunity to reserve their names early in exchange for announcing which server they would be streaming on.
---
Here’s one for my mr. Genius, my account is currently inactive but I wanna reserve some names. EXPLAIN HOWNTONDO THAT’

They don’t claim to be responsible ambassadors for their nation tho...

I know just making sure he wasn’t planning that.
---
You won't find them. There was only a handful of people seriously trying to speedlevel in vanilla and they all naturally played hunter.  
---
  
---
Everything you read about comparisons between the classes is speculation or based on private server data.
---
No, it's reddit. This site by its design encourages extremism and circlejerking.
---
Good, fuck these cancerous streamer idiots. Spoiled children, all of them and their idiot underlings who will do anything to get a shoutout.
---
Is mass pvp about who has more frost mages spamming blizzard? doesn't seem like there's much of a counter for that.
---
One thing that streamers will bring is a lot of PvP activity.
---
In all the years I played (Vanilla to WotL) I always wanted to play a pvp server, but never did. This time I'm going for it. See you there!
---
I’ve met a few. Some very very good arena players are from SA. 
---
But it’s legit like 1000 to 1
---
The guy who does these videos on Osrs is Torvesta, and he was very well known by the community before he started hunting streamers. He knows most other big name old school streamers irl as well, so it’s not like he’s a random person posting killing streamers for free clout
---
Modern WoW is neither an RPG or an MMO(socially) I feel like.
---
And those were the best servers. You could find groups in minutes. Yea world chat was a disaster but I think the pservers really had time to tune the starting zones, rare mobs, and quest mobs for massive populations. I never had a problem finding a group for a quest where you had to kill a specific mob because there was always four others ready to group up for it. I honestly think layering is a really dumb idea after maybe the first week or two to dissipate the leveling waves.
---
If you look outside this sub reddit for classic wow discussion it’s barely mentioned. Lukewarm responses in r/pcgaming. Personally I’m fine with that. Smaller communities are policed better and what not. This sub seems to think it will topple retail though!
---
Give that samwise is metal af, this works and is intended.
---
Asmonbald is alliance on retail. I think the most famous ones are Alliance on retail.
---
People like to make this excuse.  But causing that issue isn't him overreacting.  That's how he's going to react because he's a piece of utter trash who only cares about his own viewership and personal "success".  Streamers are the fucking worst guild members.  It's unfortunate people love them for some reason when they're just the most toxic of player broadcasting their toxicity.
---
Asmongold used to ninjaloot all the time.  The fuck you would want him in ur guild?
---
Org in the stress test actually makes me sad. IDC about layering in the open world that much but cities should not have it at all
---
Wow I had no idea this has existed so long. I'm a bit shocked it slipped by me. :o
---
I’d do dirty things to get quartz working on Classic
---
I can hear it already "WOW BLIZZARD! WHY would you let these ****ing streamers reserve their names before EVERYONE ELSE!!!!" - Random sperg.
---
Sounds like a PR nightmare waiting to happen by catering to streamers.
---
Why not have both? Make sure the streamers promoting your game aren't assholes
---
&gt; wouldn't be a problem if they didn't have toxic followers and promote toxic culture.
---
i dunno man, looks like we have some ripe toxic entitlement here as well, if this thread is anything to go by. Pot calling the kettle black and all that.
---
You can really get famous for becoming a streamer nemesis.
---
this isn't "back in the day", you can see monk and death knight on it.
---
Are you kidding?  It would be the best thing to happen to his stream ever.  People flock to drama.  If he freaks out and shit everyone would watch.
---
Actually the gms can check those rolls.
---
At least they could in Wotlk when my guildie got banned for ninjaing DBW.
---
They are both shitheads.
---
THis always makes me baffled when people talk so highly of Legion. Like I Fulle agree it was a better expansion than WoD &amp; BFA by lightyears but its also crazy glorified by being inbetween those 2 shitholes making it seem better than it was.
---
It added Mythic+, had a few class questlines(that werent challenging, just some generic story tbh) and magetowers. Apart from that the expansion itself was trash imo.
---
Quite the goodie-2shoes attitude. It's perfectly possible to express a thought out and valid view without being a fucking princess about it m8. Do you know why that's all you've got to say? Because you don't want me to be right. You had to look for something to whine about to avoid having to question your beliefs. I don't want to be right either, but I'll not hide from reality because it hurts your sensibilities.
---
Yes it would seem you are correct. I wasn't sure what the [gear planner](https://classic.wowhead.com/gear-planner/warlock/gnome) was actually working on.
---
Without any gear on the level 60 Gnome has Int being 119 and Human being 110. This correlates with the [base stats](https://classicwow.live/guides/46/basic-stats-sheet#class_and_race_level_60_base_stats) I can find and is before the 5% applied.
---
I actually forgot to just switch it to gnome the first time and multiplied the human one manually so I wasn't taking base stat differences into account anyway.
---
So with the gear I have here the Gnome has 340 int, the human 321 so it seems it is applying the buff only to the gear. 321 - 110 = 211 as the value of the gear alone. So 330 for the Gnome before the buff and 346 after for a total of +25 int over the Human. That's 375 mana and almost half a percent crit chance.
---
You act like this doesn’t happen on retail.
---
Spoiler: It does.
---
I played for 12 hours and I'm hooked, again.
---
Yup full feral. Rogue/feral is a fun duo.
---
Don't pay then.  Probably screwed anyways if you want a particular name.  People practiced character creation just to make their name faster.  Creative enough to make another name?  You should be good.  If it wasn't for subbed only then all kinds of names would get reserved that may never get used.  That being said they could have made name res the week prior to release but the difference is only a few dollars then so not huge.
---
1ms - France :) original servers were near Paris. Guess the new ones too
---
Ooga
---
Anyone can use a quiver...
---
&gt; If a single guild wants to ruin a streamers entire day
---
guess what, they don't. Grand majority probably don't give a flying fuck.
---
Farm the crap out of the starting zone. Kill everything as you run to objectives. If you leave at lvl 8, the first 20 or so levels are *so* much easier.
---
Stonetalon starts at 16-17 I think (maybe earlier, but the quests are harder at that level)
---
Hillsbrad at 18 or 19.
---
it's impossible to do this with the number of servers there are
---
Yeah, but the quiver is only visible to the person using it. It won't show up on your back to other players
---
I rolled PvE in vanilla, but later discovered a love for wpvp. I also really enjoy RP, and I find that the faction hostility is a core part of RP (for me) which is why this time, I'm maining Horde as a part of #GrobMob. I do have some nice Alliance backstories cooked up so I'll eventually roll Ally alts on Bloodsail, unless they open another rp-pvp.
---
I agree, this does not seem possible.
---
Nah, he is the FORMER high inquisitor, hes not still a part of the scarlet crusade.. they killed him and dumped his body in the back room.
---
To be honest, I don't mind having non major streamers. I don't consider any one person to ever be a problem, but someone with an caseload of toxic fanboys will be.
---
Hell, from what I've seen some of the streamers aren't even bad. The only ones who I would avoid if they weren't streamers are asmon and soda.
---
Why would you possibly think he wouldn't either be the gm or in bed with the gm? The man did irl corporate fraud and we're making him efamous. He can spin this however and keep being the trump of classic wow.

this is ridiculous. play on a server or dont. if you want, waste your whole day trying to stream snipe instead of just enjoying the game. because it is just a game.
---
Anyone who worships these losers needs to go seek help.
---
If you're alliance then stonetalon mountain and ashenvale starting at lvl 16-18 will be the first zones that are contested with a good number of quests for both factions. Other then that lvl 28-30 is when you start hitting all the contested areas that have a solid number of quests for both factions, and it stays like that till lvl 60. Stv, Hillsbrad, shimmering flat, desolace will be the first zones
---
Yup! I'm pretty sure he was one of the originals in 2007. Doesn't matter if the person knows the streamers personally or not, it's entertaining.
---
Not like Tips has a chance at it, anyway.
---
Any guild capable of doing it wouldn't need their members to prove themselves 2 weeks before launch.
---
Highly disagree that your numbers or optimistic. They are just plain incorrect as a certainty

That's him! It's pretty entertaining

Wow gets DESTROYED by FACTS and ~~LAYERING~~ BRAZILIANS?
---
The mods literally started locking anything remotely negative, including threads about layering.
---
It'll be like shit. I don't understand why its so difficult for them to have virtual servers on each physical server so they can have more individual realms. There is easily going to be over a million players across all the realms in the beginning, they will never be able to turn off layering and not have it be crowded. 5k population is a healthy amount to have without layering.
---
There’s a huge difference between opting in for transfer and being forced. The implications are massively different. 
---
I thought the shop for classic includes server transfer?
---
I’ve just seen too many people raging and saying “go back to retail noob” to very obvious trolls
---
Basically after level 20 all the zones on PvP servers are contested. Some zones are less contested then others, like stone talon mountains has primarily a horde presence. ashenvale has primarily an alliance presence.
---
You want to kill streamers don't you
---
Imagine if the ooga gang did this and just make highlight videos. It would be amazing to hear some streamers try to "blacklist" them.
---
This is the only Dwarf face to choose honestly...
---
The same way they merge live servers. Whoever logs in first after the merge keeps their name and the slow group has to rename their stuff. It also happens on Tuesdays for Raid Lockouts.
---
You’ve been lucky so far. I am brazilian, but I am also ashamed of my country mates. The ones who have but a basic grasp of english knowledge are the majority. 
---
They get pissed at me for playing the game in english.
---
Is he joking?
---
Sad to say soda is just as bad in his own way: Wants to run a streamer/twitchchat organised blacklist. You gank him, you get blacklisted and both factions will exempt you from groups, guilds etc. He expressed this a while bk, vod out there somewhere. It was some srs chinese social point bs to listen 2.
---
Yes
---
Play the game how I want and not care about streamers.
---
&gt; What's the problem here? 
---
Wording and attitude reinforcing the negative perception of him.
---
Back to private servers!
---
Ironic
---
I find the RP realms are the best for that.
---
Everyone else is just "black-list streamers" or "we don't want no foreigners!"  It's reprehensible.
---
Fuck it. I'm in
---
Why play on a PVP server if you're just going to Blacklist everyone who kills you
---
I only downvoted this to hide any knowledge of the IF AH.  You will not take patrons away from my city!!!
---
RP servers shouldnt be layered just like retail rp servers arent sharded
---
Sounds like it could make for some fun world pvp right off the bat to be honest.
---
Its just spell batching. Everyone has it. You’re just more aware of it.
---
Great!

---
and yet there are idiots that keep asking why people don't want to play on streamer servers
---
Oh ok. I could see that. But I dont think thats its the wording that the thread is going off on. Judging by the comments in general
---
imagine rolling a literal trash mob server
---
It needs to get removed before release.
---
What would his ''tailored brand'' be exactly?
---

Same did who on lvls and classes and realized there was around 400 ppl in SW at some point but i only saw 11.. i felt so lonely
---
Ah ok.. so the delivery of it all more or less?
---
lol
---
I'm trying to understand your way of thinking, since you just keep repeating the same thing over and over without introducing a real point. Why do you feel that there shouldn't be a server where we can enjoy the game without streamers? Why are you taking this so personally? Are you an amateur streamer yourself?
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nobel_laureates_by_country
---
Buddy.. he would precisely expect that. Have you seen a single thing he's ever done?
---
Basically goes for both of them lol
---
The idea of layering makes sense in theory, but in practice the results have been abysmal. And that's the problem. 
---
It shouldn't be around for a few weeks to a month either. At max, I'd say 3 days and active users should normalize at least enough to make layering redundant.
---
Hopefully Blizz doesn't drop the ball right out the gate on this one.
---
no its not. when i type a message i can snap my fingers before it shows up on screen, its big 500 latency when i have 30ms.
---
Not sure I disagree in this case. I think he can have wierd and borderline dumbrequirements for his own guild. People can just opt out of it np.
---
Lol. That's funny. Reminds me of monster Hunter world. I would sometimes disconnect from the group and I am stuck fighting the boss by myself. 
---
This is gonna be terrible.I will play classic, but this is just game breaking for me

Imagine working a job where your jobs takes 70%+ of the money you generate while you're borderlining poverty, lmao, fucking losers.
---
Or maybe we wait and see what happens and if blizzard are wrong then they get called out for it? Right now people are getting their knickers in a twist over a situation they hasn’t even occurred yet.
---
They can ruin a sever’s community. Not the streamer themselves, but the following they have.
---
still mad you were Pk'd on a Pk centric game? lol. join a clan.
---
For the most part, he’s generally not too terrible. It’s his mongo followers that are the real source of the cancer
---
I feel you guys, but as an Oceanic player... At least you have SOME choice.
---
Ragnaros is not a fucking BR server holy shit. Brazilians don't speak Spanish.
---
Oh, I've never played on an RP server so I didn't know they were excluded from sharding/layering. Glad they're safe at least.
---
They did mention somewhere that they would prioritize guild members to be on the same layer so i hope they fix this
---
Ok that seems fair. Thanks for the response :)
---
&gt;The vocal minority are the ones whining about streamers and servers.
---
You're completely right, but there is a large group of people who are not trashing streamers relentlessly who still don't want to play on the same server as them. It'd be a nice gesture on their part to help these people out and not roll on a server after being asked.
---
Roll a PvE server.  You will appreciate it more than you will ever know.
---
um... don't you think that there are way to little servers?  I'm pretty sure like 1 mil people are gonna be trying to logging in.  I also saw a post about layering fucking up groups!  Did blizzard say anything about fixing it?
---
The exclusivity of the classic beta stirred up jealousy and then the blacklist drama creating a fear of ganking or defending yourself from a streamer... Personally I would like to dodge asmon's server because he IS the wow section of twitch so his server will be massively alliance heavy
---
Brazilians hate the “jajaja” typically associated with the Spanish speaking south Americans (mostly from the Andean region).
---
I wouldn't even bother with VMware.  Just use UNetBootIn to make a bootable thumb drive and take a spin.
---
They can do whatever they want - why board the Titanic when you already know it is going to sink.  So that leaves streamerville with Asmond and his band of 12 y.o. boy followers and the other PvP server.  If Asmond weren't such a prick, he'd just tell us where he is landing so we can avoid him.
---
I'm afraid not lol
---
Because it's full of rping nerds. Bad idea.
---
Out of all content creators I think they are among the least disturbing ones regarding how they and their community impact your gameplay.
---
EU wants a word with you
---
As someone who was part of the world first rush (and loser of said race) I couldn't imagine why anyone would willingly attempt to raid MC in the first week of launch.  I am really looking forward to Classic, and I am looking forward to raiding again.... but I have every intention of enjoying the journey and have outgrown the mentality that the game doesn't start until you're at level cap.
---
Sign me right the fuck up.
---
i mean yeah, it sucks what youve done here
---
it turns me laughing at a funny meme into me cringing at your blog
---
What's wrong with Fairbanks?  Staysafe and others already confirmed they aren't playing there.    Don't ruin the RP server
---
Brazil don't speak Spanish.
---
this guy is the biggest loser. i guarantee he rolls on a pve realm.
---
Well done! That place is tough at the 15 cap
---
Because he precisely lied and said he did play vanilla wow. He stated nothing short of being the best NA warr dueler in vanilla. How is someone blatantly lying to your face someone you care to defend?
---
I never said there shouldn't be one. I said you're not entitled to know what server Asmongold or any other streamer will roll on. If they tell you then that's great. But they're not obligated and people calling them assholes because he will roll on any server he wants is absurd.
---
Thanks!
---
People are over-reacting to this clip. He's not talking about blacklisting people just because he doesnt like them. He's talking about blacklisting players for repeatedly stream sniping him and being obnoxious. This is a thing people used to do when servers had communities anyway. Sure it wasn't because of stream sniping but blacklists existed for people who were known ninja looters and did other disruptive acts. I don't want to play on the server with all the streamers either, but its not because of the streamer themselves. It's because of their community. If you only watch clips of streamers you're obviously going to have a negative opinion because negative shit is what gets views and clips especially when you're stroking an anti-streamer agenda left and right. These aren't bad people yo. Chill.
---
Sounds like excellent PR for PvE servers.  :D
---
Layering isn't sharding btw LULW
---
NA has 3 PvP servers on the eastcoast, Faerlina, Thalnos and Herod. 
---
The big streamer(s) (Asmon, Soda etc) will play on eastcoast and on PvP server. Meaning one of these 3 servers will be a "Streamer" server. Lots of fanboys, community ran events, weird economy, twitch chat memes. For some people this is the kind of server they want to play on. For others it just isn't. Others want it pure. 
---
One of the groups who want it pure, no streamer shenanigans is the Brazilian Classic WoW community. 
---
Brazil is a Portugese nation and whichever realm they decide to go to will be the unofficial Portugese server. 
---
They (an union of Brazilian guilds and communities) announced that they'll play on Thalnor. As a direct result of this, many Brazilians will play there. It's already the unofficial Brazilian server.
---
That leaves 2 servers. 
---
And 3 large communities on the eastcoast who want to play.
---
Streamers &amp; fans.
---
Latin America
---
NA eastcoast players who want to dodge streamers.
---
And it doesn't even prevent sending gear from a previous leveled char. You might be able to so it in 4 hrs.

How fucking sad is it that these people can't speak their own language in the default channels of the game they play cause people will get fucking butthurt
---
this won't actauly work in reality, people he black lists are still going to be in a guild of their own
---
because he try to cornerstone the stream market with no prio knowledge of anything, now he talking like some huge method prick whens he's abysmal at playing
---
Optimism is good to have.
---
The kids will go back to playing fortnite and cod...
---
The Stress Test Server is what the live server will look like more or less, agreed?
---
The people on the stress test are literally a fraction of the anticipated players at launch, right?
---
So what you're seeing here isn't an accurate representation of what you'll see at launch. 
---
This should be obvious.
---
Now you're contradicting yourself. By saying that streamers shouldn't tell us what server he won't be on, you're saying there shouldn't be a server without streamers. If all streamers agreed to leave us a streamer-free server, would you play on it?
---
If you have the hardware just go to settings - graphics and slide it up from classic (3) to (10) and jack up all the options!
---
Even the models look very crisp, while still being the old models, heck even the low texture armour looks much much better than old client
---
Have you ever played on a server with Brazillians or been on a server where you queue with BR servers? 
---
The difference in player quality is night and day. You have extremely good players, some speak english and others don't, but generally the higher level players are either elitist pricks or generally nice and knowledgable people. The bad players spam the shit out of you, chat channels, and report/flame you as soon as you throw any criticism their way. Don't even get me started with ninja looting. 
---
The issue I've found is that there is no in-between. Or they are a silent minority. 
---
Honestly, plenty of NA people do exactly the same shit, if you break it down to just the communication barrier, then yea people could play there if it was all English in most chats. But it's still a mistake to think that the BR server will be issue free.
---
Most of these trolls are tourists and will likely be gone once theyve gotten their taste of Classic and realize it's not the loot piñata single-player action rpg that is retail. In the meantime,  /leave 1 or put General in a separate window if they really get your panties in a bunch.
---
I could care less about grammar. It's more like the people who join groups cause wipes and ninja everything. It isn't exclusive to BR. There are many who do it. But yeah there is a reason that this stereotype exists. And it won't be any different.
---
found titan panel nice, its clean ui, always there,  can mouse over for more info if you want.
---
They also dont want to play with some of them due to some of their Toxic behavior in game.
---
Ok fatty
---
I start downranking in deadmines on priest
---
AT LEAST ALEX PLAYED
---
Or maybe it's people like me who have been playing WoW for well over a decade, and who don't want to deal with a million people in the same place on launch, or have everyone spread out on way too many servers that will be dead in 3 months.
---
If you are allowed to mail gear to the character it becomes much easier. Imagine having bis at every level 1 to 15
---
Grobb already has a Rp community building pretty quickly actually, why both going to an Rp server and not Rp? Sounds like a waste and you guys will be surrounded by people playing a way you don’t want to be a part of. We’ve seen it in retail, don’t do it in classic.
---
**Totally made up.**
---
He still has the MH glaive, and all but 3 pieces of gear are unchanged from this clip, one of which we saw him loot off of Illidan anyway (the chest).
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/us/dalaran/sodaseventee
---
He has exactly ONE Illidan kill under his belt - so its not like he went back there and won the glaive a 2nd time legitimately.
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/us/dalaran/sodaseventee/pve/raids

Soda showed up to BT for the first time, screamed, cried, lost the roll, and got the legendary anyway - and no, Blizz GMs did nothing.
---
bLaCkLiStEd 🐩
---
Could do that in Microsoft paint in like 2 minutes lol
---
All I can say is that Hunters/Warlocks are the hands down fastest levelers.  Affliction warlocks never have to stop, and hunters can use their resources/pet to keep going relatively endlessly but at the cost of currency.
---
Hunters do level faster, specifically in the 1-40 range where they will get buffs to speed which matters more than most realize in classic.  
---
Post level 40 assuming both classes have their mounts, they become nearly equal, but usually the hunter will have gotten to 40 slightly faster.
---
Have you ever played Vanilla warlock?  Honest question, because what you just wrote smells completely troll.
---
You DO have bags to manage them for you.  They are called Soul Shard Bags and they automatically fill with shards.  Every single Warlock worth their salt will have at least one, probably 2.  
---
And why are you completely ignoring my direct response to everything you wrote prior?
---
Warlocks will be underrepresented on Alliance because of the WOTF passive.  Most Horde players will be Forsaken, and Warlocks are incredibly weak in world PvP if they cannot fear you.  Horde will only be underrepresented on Warlocks if you are comparing their numbers to Mages, because Mages scale better into later content.  This is literally how every single private server plays out.  Soul shards are a non factor.
---
Agree to disagree compadre
---
Wait.  You're a 17yo whom is hyped for classic WoW?  Really?
---
1: you’ll be able to create your character to reserve the name, but you won’t be able to enter the game until it officially launches on the 26th
---
2: this isn’t really a question. Just play whatever you think looks cool. Don’t feel bad if you make a character and you don’t like it. I played 3 classes before I found my forever main.
---
4: you can only have 2 primary professions at a time, but you can drop a profession to pick up a different one if you want to

Confirmed, you must go back to your own race starting area at 10 to do your hunter quests, to learn how to train pets.

This post..
---
Holy shit, this is actual meme material.
---
Jeez with the amount of childish bullshit in this and other threads you guys can have that server just so I can avoid the bickering on other servers.
---
No, there is no contradiction just a failure of reading comprehension
---
&gt;By saying that streamers shouldn't tell us
---
I didn't say they ***shouldn't tell you***. You're not entitled to know and they're not obligated to tell you. If they want to tell you then that's great for them. You're not owed that information and they're not assholes for not disclosing it.
---
It's just a reasonable assumption that the majority of people who play Classic over the 1st week will not get to max level or continue playing for several months. Classic is a niche game, and it's incredibly slow paced by today's standards.
---
Doesnt that just make the server even worse
---
You talking about subreddit or stress test?
---
Depends what potions shields and trinkets you got! You’ll have to use your noodle to think of a clever counter. Off the top of my head, an engineers dynamite is a good interrupt for any class.

The only thing Alex played was himself because he's a tinfoil hat toxic wizard of a human.

The loudest and most obnoxious people unfortunately tend to set the stereotype. It happens with most groups, the ones that don't act like idiots don't get noticed and don't influence people's opinions
---
definitely got dat succ.
---
Twitter, Reddit, official forums, however they want to let us know.
---
This is awesome. Like actual international diplomacy happening. Props to BR for reaching out like this.
---
I’m talking about all the memes, videos, streamers, the game itself - creating days upon days of enjoyable relatable content
---
The issue is less with the streamers themselves, but their crazy fanbases.
---
If you're on a server with a major streamer, you can expect the following to happen:
---
- Public chat channels will turn into twitch spam and will be filled with "PLZ INV TO &lt;insert streamer name&gt;'s GUILD", "HAS ANYONE SEEN &lt;insert streamer name&gt;?", "LETS GANK/DEFEND &lt;insert streamer name&gt;" etc etc. 
---
- the server community will no longer be about the game, it will be about &lt;insert streamer name&gt;
---
- instead of various server events happening naturally because of the actions of the players, they will be instead promoted and organized by &lt;insert streamer name&gt;
---
- if you happen to do something that they don't like, their fanbase can mass report you for some made up reason
---
- their fans will feed their idol with gear/mats/gold
---
Just to list a few things

Tips is a poser
---
This sub is so damn gullible
---
Yeah, some people are bad at understanding what actually makes them angry.
---
Any good guild is going to have high requirements, but what makes this stand out is the way he addresses his guild"mates"
---
&gt; You DO have bags to manage them for you. They are called Soul Shard Bags and they automatically fill with shards. Every single Warlock worth their salt will have at least one, probably 2.
---
Yea, if you read my post at all you'd have seen it. 
---
&gt; Awesome having to have a bag slot dedicated to just soul shards.
---
Here's me getting reminded that you had to have a bag slot dedicated to just soul shards. 
---
&gt; That and managing soul shards when you don't have the bag to conveniently store them automatically for you.
---
Here's me mentioning that not only do you lose a bag slot, you have to manage the soul shards when you ***don't have the bag to conveniently store them automatically*** for you, which again, is a hassle. 
---
&gt; Warlocks will be underrepresented on Alliance because of the WOTF passive. 
---
Wrong because they ***stayed*** underrepresented through the majority of the following expansions. 
---
&gt; This is literally how every single private server plays out. Soul shards are a non factor.
---
Private servers are not an indication of anything. Point of the entire argument was that players tend to not want to deal with classes that have extra work involved to simply use them.
---
Got you fam
---
At the end of the day you just gotta go with your heart on character creation. There will always be a guild or group to pick you up. They might not be #1 or the sweatiest... But you'll have more fun and enjoy your character. The best part of classic wow is the immersion and feeling like your character is an extention of yourself in a fantasy world. Let that consume you for the better.
---
If it's disrupting the game for the masses it's not good advertising. That's the shit that makes people quit.
---
Very happy the game could lift her and your spirits like that.
---

---
Bro, highlight where I said that Tips was any good.
---
Alex is just worse in general.
---
just a hint, people downvote heading starting like yours with even bothering to read
---
wouldnt that affect your other keybinds though? assuming you cant use 1 on the keyboard and 1 on the numpad?
---
simple, i like it :p
---
True that.
---
&gt;Why don't a bunch of non rp guilds just role on here?
---
You can certainly try. People tend to forget the PVP part of RP-PVP and think they won't just get camped off the server.
---
I just wrote a guide today here on this reddit.  
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/colnzr/installing\_classic\_or\_retail\_wow\_in\_linux/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/colnzr/installing_classic_or_retail_wow_in_linux/)
---
Not according to the reddit realm survey that's been stickied at the top of this subreddit
---
Everyone won't be
---
Your problem won't be with "not knowing" each other. 
---
The problem will be getting a group together in a timely fashion. 
---
In the last couple of weeks of beta, I found myself unable to find a group for deadmines. I would spam general in both Westfall and Stormwind to no avail. 
---
I'd get on, try for a bit, and then log off to try again some other time since I really wanted to get deadmines questing done. I eventually got a group together and we ran it without issue. 
---
That was one of the main reasons the group finder was created. To optimize dungeon groups so you wouldn't waste time setting them up. 
---
This issue won't be a problem at launch, and it won't be a problem after a couple of weeks once Classic is out. 
---
It will be a problem though later on when the game is older and players have moved to endgame. New players leveling up will not have the same influx of players to quest with, and thus it will be harder to form groups. 
---
Thus the reason group finder was introduced was to make old content ***always*** doable so long as people queued up.
---
Yeah! You take that bullet! In your cloth dress...
---
Ha ha, Trump bad, ha ha.
---
Trump and this idiot are nothing alike.

Don't worry man.  If they pick Herod, we'll all coordinate to make it unplayable for them.
---
This guy was ripping lines of cocaine while he was casting the duel tournament.
---
Okay, do we have a list yet for which servers the massive streamers will be on?
---
I think it's because Trump's ass is THICC in that picture, and people are selling whitemane's physical attractiveness as a feature for that realm.
---
No thiccness on Fairbanks, according to the image in my read of it
---
Yeah, a couple guilds agreeing to some guidelines is totally going to erase a language barrier. ^^s
---
I can't fucking wait to play this game
---
Been thinking about switching distro to Mankato anyway. Thanks for the guide
---
You're honestly better off waiting for a good pserver after Classic is a total failure
---
thin ice blizzard is walking with that layering shit.
---
not alot of people that wanted classic will mess with this shit if its stays past phase 1.
---
And there's half a month between reserving your name and actual Classic release. Like I said, I can't pay half a sub for half the money so I'd have to pay the full sub, which would mean my sub would expire like 15 days into Classic, so in effect I'd be paying Blizzard an extra month worth of sub. So rather than it costing me 2$ it'd cost me 15.
---
You realise that since there are so few servers that every server will be have streamers? A huge portion of the twitch platform will be playing classic.
---
As an paladin who heals exclusively, here is my perspective. In a 5 man dungeon a paladin tank's upside of aoe threat generation through reflect damage (blessing of sanctuary, retribution aura, and holy shield) and consecration makes trash so much better b/c if the tank starts the fight on their own terms and he marks a skull kill first target then the run goes so much faster because the group can use high dps aoe skills. On the downside he has to stop for mana every other pull if not every pull assuming he doesn't use mana potions. So really it evens out. Unfortuantly that resource generation is not their only downside. No Taunt means in the event that they do lose aggro, their probably not getting it back where a taunt could force the aggro back. In dungeons it's not a big deal, but as raids get higher tiered, lack of high power spell damage plate (because paladins deal increased threat with holy damage) means that protection paladins do not scale well.
---
TLDR: In dungeons it evens out and they are roughly equal to the other tanks but for diffrent reasons.
---
They are actually different binds at least on all the keyboards I've ever used. It'll show up as numb pad one instead of just 1
---
I just dont see blizzard, as a company, banking on classic fizzling out. They did put plenty of time and resources into getting classic up. They want to see a good return on that investment. Also, this is a huge opportunity to get a ton of people resubbed or playing the first time even. They like to tout their sub count.
---
how about they give us classic and actually pay for good servers instead of doing some contrived patchy system that has people hopping dimensions?
---
Is there any evidence this is actually the case?  Genuinely asking.
---
Sadly, you underestimate neckbeards!
---
I would imagine if anything, the GM duplicated and gave the guy his glaive.
---
Exact opposite for me. Was alliance in vanilla, love the quests/zones but I’m going horde w my guild in classic and trying to figure out which race to choose. 
---
Think orc is the only way to go for me (will be playing warrior most likely if not rogue and the stun resist passive is too good to pass on)
---
Zzz
---
The server they said they werent on is br though
---
Need more Horde guilds on Pagle!
---
I don't give a shit about streamers but this is some right obnoxious elitist garbage he's spouting
---
Not to mention that getting to 15 on the stress test doesn't mean shit... Not that he'd know, of course, dude never actually played vanilla and acts like hot shit in his discord full of fanboys
---
kinda miss when ur characters would emote at you, seems cute to me
---
If they roll herod, I'm rolling the opposite faction and making a guild with the primary goal to either 1) corpse camp while they stream [with priority list ofc] or 2) gear up to improve first goal.
---
HEROD IS OFF LIMITS STREAMERS.
---
Honestly all you can do is not watch their streams. Not watch Twitch at all. Not buy things from whoever sponsors them. And maybe write emails to sponsors or whoever is helping them. 
---
I would never condone mass reporting someone, but wouldn’t the algorithms keep locking them out of playing over and over if people did that?  Till maybe they just fuck off to another game?
---
Well for me personally. I'm that boring dude that just plays humans. But all of my friends are rolling horde so I'm succumbing to peer pressure and playing horde. I think the most important thing you can do is make sure the experience is as good as it can be. Don't play a class you don't want to play. Don't play a race you don't like. You're going to spend atleast 100 hours levelling this character. And then 100s of more getting your pre raid bis and getting into an MC raid of that's what you want to do.
---
Yes that sweet sweet stun resist. If I do go horde again I'm going for an orc hunter but it's a tough choice! I feel very torn
---
I just don't get why blizzard plans to release naxx in classic. It was WotLK.
---
This is a joke, right?
---
I can guarantee blizzard has a better guess than you or any other armchair developer.
---
There are only a handful or servers and a huge portion of the twitch platform will be playing classic, every server will have streamers
---
Sure, of course there is no reason to tell anyone what server you play on. Unless of course you're a streamer with malicious intentions and a ton of influence over thousands of players. In case you're out of the loop (because you really seem to be), here's a link. Click on it.

This lol
---
Layering should not happen like this.
---
Seems like a phasing issue to me, similar to when you are in durotar you cant see players on orgrimmar, which was in Vanilla too. Or similiar when running to a herb/mine node and it vanishes on front of you, thats phasing, not sharding, not layering.
---
Layering should happen when character is created and thats it, excluding partying. If this infact is layering, then its a bug.
---
Did all of your mates run to the left of you when this happened? might be a phasing point then.
---
Hopefully layering will work as intended when Classic arrives whatever the case was.
---
whats ur isp? are u in canada with bell?
---
Sorry but I don't really agree with that logic.
---
I LOVE my job. I was blessed enough to work in a field that was also my hobby for many years.   
---
Am I not allowed to have fun?
---
Can't trust into from someone that can't spell "responses" when discussing responses.
---
Holy shit, the Ji-kun one was hilarious. Thank you.

You've got packet loss.
---
Honestly I dont see the problem, if he wants to run his guild that way and people want to join him, let them. He lets socials be exempt so its really not that bad. That being said, I think 6 hours is pretty damn fast. I think I could do it but its pretty damn fast. Joanna's world record speed run has 1-15 at 6.17 hours. Things have certainly been improved upon since then but damn
---
Who is this buttlord?
---
Why did I just resub for the first time in a decade to get this layering shit. 
---
Fuck you Blizzard. If population needs to be limited, support more servers. I’m fucking paying for your server to be ran.
---
I’m deciding between Fairbanks &amp; Whitemane. The early polls on here showed Fairbanks with a big Horde following &amp; Whitemane more 50/50. So right now I’m leaning Whitemane just for the fact that it seems more Alliance will be there and more balanced. (I’m rolling Horde). 
---
I know the polls are a very small sample size, but I feel like west coast alliance pvp’ers will go Whitemane just off name alone. Fairbanks seems like the safest choice (big streamers aren’t going there, South Americans, etc) if factions are balanced I could pivot there.
---
Sigh... again, we're not talking about the cost of Name Reservation, only the cost of the Global Test combined with Name Reservation, which is an extra 4 days of subscription. If you plan on reserving names, you're wasting 14 days of subscription. If you plan on reserving names and playing the Global Test, you're wasting 18 days of subscription.
---
The best part is you can't prove they're sniping, but they'll get condemned as such regardless. And the streamers themselves will never be blamed for sniping when they camp people themselves making for an entirely assymetrical situation favoring them.
---
Hopefully it works as intended on launch, aka layered once character is created and thats it.
---
They'd just become insanely high population as many if not most players would roll on RP servers regardless of their interest in RP.
---
Orc is def the best for a pvp server. If you're rolling on pve how ever. And have little intention to do pvp at all. Tuaren is actually quite good for a warrior also.
---
people with no actual power powertripping.  Fucking loser assholes
---
&gt; Sure, of course there is no reason to tell anyone what server you play on.
---
Again, a failure in reading comprehension. I never said that.
---
Apologies
---
Get an anti-streamer raid, make sure he dies every single fight.
---
Make streamers YOUR content.
---
good, I think i will have a lot of fun exploring again, maybe we will find new things that haven't been found at the time?(well dubious knowing private server must have been combed through but still)
---
We certainly are done, because you still continue to ignore everything I originally wrote to you.  You just keep trying to cry about other things as a distraction, but it's not going to work because I will continue to remind you every time until you finally address it.
---
I have to lol at you one more time, though, because the bag is given to you when you learn how to summon your felhunter.  There is literally 0 additional work you have to do.  Nearly every class has class quests, and this one that you do for your felhunter just so happens to give you a free shard bag as well.  Though I suppose if you find managing shards a hassle, you might consider 0 additional work to also be a hassle.
---
Oh hey, are you finally going to address anything I originally wrote to you?  In case you forgot, again.
---
I don't know if Soda thinks that classic content is hard or what, but finding a group of people that want to ruin streamers experience AND raid wont be that hard. If he legit thinks he has the power to decide which players on the opposite faction will get gear that's just adorable. Every job has shitty parts of it, and if he  decided to play on a pvp server where opposite factions players will have his location 24/7, then that is on him . People are legit going to go to streamer servers to play opposite faction and ruin their life.   
---
I also love how soda says he will go out of his way to camp lv 15 lowbies but when someone does it to him BLACKLISTED.
---
The problem with adding servers after launch is this: who is going to play on them?
---
Everyone is going to have already planned with their friends and guild which server they want to be on. They aren't just going to wait weeks after launch for the hope of a new server coming out. If people start playing after launch, they're going to want to be where their friends are, not some new server with a low population and nobody they know.
---
Shit like this makes me want to leave Reddit.        /pervs
---
except only like 5 are going to be disruptive to the server
---
Leaning Whitemane for us too at the moment due to the balance. Just waiting to avoid the big streamer realm but I have a feeling we just won't knoe
---
I had no idea that you were the premium authority on the legitimacy of class polls and guilds being formed pre-launch.
---
I am sure glad to see that proper authorities are on this mystery, surely for no reason shall it ever deviate from the precious, pure and PERFECT form that are Private Servers.
---
All hail the Private Servers, the Private Servers know best.
---
Brazilians are a smaller community so I'm guessing Thalnos is still the right choice here.
---
It ain't that simple if you don't speak whatever language this is...
---
Isn't this kind of a backwards way of looking at it, though? Blizzard said they wouldn't have Classic servers at first, but that was likely because they weren't *certain* that they would have them. It's much worse to create excitement and then let people down than to let people down and then *go back on your word /s* by actually confirming that there will be something that people can look forward to. 
---
Promising a negative and then breaking the promise is not equal to promising a positive and then breaking *that* promise.
---
The word is just cult.
---
Its because if you take away the E its Whiteman. Super unfortunate

Ahh, the good old days when you could use an mmo to escape reality. 
---
Keep it up.
---
This term is called "Aggro Assist" :&gt;
---
There where people on pserver who did this for over a year straight and they already announced to roll on streamer servers.
---
Yah, a good PVP player could sit there and wipe out the sad  streamer bootlickers that probably still mouse click.
---
honestly, most of this subreddit is talking as if its the majority. at most you get a few thousand upvotes on streamer post. and most people really dont care about a streamer you might run by once or see at a dungeon entrance. if you dont want  to play with them just dont. put them on /ignore and the people who spam shit in trade on /ignore.
---
it also gives them an infinitesimally better chance at getting the names they want.  since the rocket-scientist-clever mouth-breathers who follow them will be split ammongst the servers trying to beat them to it.
---
memes die quickly (see thex). but some people don’t realize they’re dead until long after everyone else has.

Honestly, who cares what server you or a streamer plays on.
---
Just play classic and stfu. Get on with the game.
---
Thalnos server is doomed
---
As a Horde player, I've been undead since day 1 and I cannot fathom playing Alliance at all.  
---
Though if I were forced, I'd probably either play human female or dwarf male.
---
Thank you.
---
Sharding? More like sharting.
---
Hackers want to relive the vanilla days too.
---
I plan on RPing an old human mage that knows the future. Gonna stand in Darnassus all day and /yell "You're all going to burn in 15 years! Flee while you can! The Dark Lady is coming for you!"
---
Which way is better?  Sitting back and enjoying this "new" classic experience where we are at the streamers mercy and should accept their table scraps?  The way they are going about it, they leave 2 servers as possible... well to be safe, take the one they for sure are not going to be on... where does that leave the server they didn't take of the 2 options they left themselves until after we reserve names?  No streamers, no influx of people wanting to avoid streamers.  They are basically picking which server has a higher probability of lower population as well as choosing the server they go on to be high pop most likely.  Or option b which you say is worse apparently... we choose their server.  Im not about a witch hunt to go downvote everything they make, I don't want that to happen and hopefully they don't either so what's the big deal if we decided only the name of their server and everyone was happy, same server location its just the name?  I'm just saying we have the power to choose and that would even out servers better.  I just don't want lopsided servers because they can't pick one early.  I would already know my server no problem but I don't because of streamers.
---
Asmon already said he's doing a PvE servers months ago.
---
Totally agree with you, bud. Anxious, whiny, and stubborn folks end up being the loudest voices, all too often. 
---
Suck it up folks. You got Classic. Count your blessings. 
---
If you only get 80% of what you want out of any situation, you WON. That's life. You don't get everything exactly as you want it.
---
Can you provide me with a link to the place you downloaded from? Perhaps it has multiple sources and one of them doesn't work?
---
Not all streamers are narcissists and sociopaths, but narcissists and sociopaths are probably drawn to being on camera and having a cult following far more than regular people. People think I am being salty when I tell them I think a ton of these big streamers are straight up sociopathic and it seems like you'd have to be to want thousands of people watching you do a mundane activity for ten hours a day and give you money for it.
---
i feel sorry for the koreans
---
You’re severely underestimating private server try harder, especially the guilds from EU.
---
dont presume to tell me what I do and dont want to play, nor how to play it.
---
Whitemane!
---
This guy is not only the shadiest fucker in the streaming scene but he's also been dead wrong about mechanics of the game and knows absolutely nothing about the game.
---
You must have missed the mod post where everyone who doesn't post 15 circlejerk hate comments against streamers in 6 hours gets permabanned from the subreddit.
---
Had the exact same thought, "so you are going to go to a RP PVP server and take it over as non RPers? Should be entertaining for the RPers"
---
Game looks fantastic on the larger/higher resolution monitors of today.  I am really enjoying it.  Looking back, I upgraded to 1080p because of WoW.  Here we are today with 4k and the art still carried really well for the theme of the game.
---
holy fuck
---
No. People are overreacting. Play wherever you want it wont matter much.

Very simple and useful :)
---
Grobbules already is looking like it is off to a great start for the RP community if you do not plan on respecting the RP community you will not be welcome.
---
Blizzard reserved their names if they are "namebrand" streamers.
---
Can't upvote this enough. Nonsensical cynicism abounds.
---
Mom tells 35 year old boy child son he cant leave the house til he cleans his room.... son becomes streamer to show pre-teens they will not progress in wow without his permission.
---
It’s just not for me. Which is great because I won’t make the mistake of rolling a server that isn’t a match for me and vice versa. I had considered it previously but don’t have the patience now, apparently
---
Implying that the 'good guilds' will all be the streamers. Don't make me laugh you fucking joke.
---
They don't have the same kind of community as asmongold/tips/the rest. They won't impact your gameplay at all.
---
I love how universal this actually is
---
Cause people don't like victim blaming the harassed.
---
There is a small minority of players who can power level with the best of them. Maybe they will cross paths with streamers.
---
And that's still way to much
---
The game batches at 400ms. This is a game back from when you had to kick mom off the phone or else you'll DC and the raid will wipe.
---
Maybe true, but 99% of streamers don't have the level of success that somebody like Soda has. Would go together that people with sociopathic tendencies have the willpower to succeed at a career that attracts sociopathic tendencies.
---
been playing since November 23 2004.
---
played on nostalrius from launch until it shut down. 60 shaman 60 warrior.
---
played on various vanilla servers after till i was bored.
---
layering is retarded and so are you.
---
If you think about it, it really sets them up for success in a corporate environment.
---
I'm so proud of you guys.
---
yeah great idea, let's fuck all the RP people and roll on the only server given to them for pvp.
---
Just channeling you
---
&gt;decide on a server, announce it, and move on. It isn’t that difficult.
---
Exactly. It will just make everyone happier this way. If they don't announce it beforehand, do they *honestly* think they aren't going to be found out 30 seconds after launch when they are streaming their location and name? Might as well make it so people that don't want to be on their server don't have to remake shortly after launch simply because they didn't announce beforehand.
---
I have the same mouse haven't noticed anything weird.  Are you accidentally hitting your dpi buttons and raising dpi?  Other than doing that or holding the dpi shift in on accident, you've got an issue.
---
Seriously, I came here to see Grobbulus fan-art and have a meltdown over EST PvP servers.  THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A SAFE SPACE.
---
corporate fraud? what?
---
Love this. It fits perfectly on how I want the UI setup. So glad this was done
---
You are extremely naive if you really think this would even happen...
---
&gt; We certainly are done, because you still continue to ignore everything I originally wrote to you. 
---
Why are you just straight up projecting like this? You completely failed to read one of my posts and I had to point it out to you, then you just kind of...shrugged it off. 
---
I don't even think you read my first post in this thread to begin with. You saw your precious Classic getting critiqued and the red mist descended. 
---
&gt; because the bag is given to you when you learn how to summon your felhunter.
---
Unlike you, I actually looked in to it because I research and check my points before just opening my mouth. You get it at level 20 when you do your Succubus quest. 
---
Which, as you probably don't know, is an example of an ***extra thing*** you have to do that most classes do not have to do. You'll find in my original post that you ***DIDN'T READ*** will point out, I mention Soul Shards as ***but one*** reason. 
---
Here's what I said: 
---
&gt; Not that they are bad, necessarily, it'll be that people just don't want to deal with the hassle and maintenance that the class has.
---
-----------------
---
&gt; There is literally 0 additional work you have to do.
---
Except, you know, soul shard maintenance and having to do quests if you want to obtain your pets that most classes don't have to bother with. 
---
&gt; Oh hey, are you finally going to address anything I originally wrote to you? In case you forgot, again.
---
I already have. You act like me not responding directly is of some consequence when you can't even read my replies carefully enough to not look like a fucking fool lol. 
---
Or do you need me to break it down for you again?
---
well they already said they would be removing after a month/before phase 2 so yeah.
---
invite to pvp layer pls
---
&gt;but no way 33k is playable.
---
There is only one way to find out.
---
I'm so sad.
---
Gotta remember though, for most people WoW isn't a job. For these streamers it likely will be. They'll outlevel a lot of the people they're simultaneously screwing over.
---
I'll upvote this
---
Good ol' Alleria
---
2 english PVP servers on EU
---
That’s funny because I see a bunch of individual people in this thread giving their individual opinions
---
It's okay, jpp. It's no great loss for you.
---
The best part of classic is the drama. Always was. Social interaction from my basement is back on the menu boys.
---
That's bizarre to me. It's like caring about which serial number my video card has printed on it...
---
I'm gonna wait a week and see where streamers aren't and the H/A balance before I make a choice.
---
Um, I never said I watch streamers and I don't... and I had to look up your beta anime term my bro.
---
Imagine being triggered this hard to forget which comment you were responding to
---
Hey mate, any updates on Aux for Classic?
---
If you don't think every server is going to have 20+ people instantly trying to get "Asmongold" on reservation day you are sadly mistaken.
---
If they want to have *the best odds* by not announcing *before reservation*, that's fair. If they want to wait until launch that argument has no defense and will just ruin peoples reservations that either do/don't want to play on streamer servers just so they can have 30 seconds after launch before being discovered.
---
Not even 5 minutes. The moment they get to login, the jig is up and 10k people are logging into that server.
---
For normal PvP but we're talking about disrupting RPers. That and I don't think you'll be on top given how tight their communities tend to be. You'll probably get betrayed by your own faction.
---
If people are anything like me, they aren't dumping time into these play tests. I intend on playing classic but have not logged into classic for these test weekends as it seems pointless to me. I am sure the pop will be fine on launch.
---
I’ve played as both factions over the years, did horde in vanilla, alliance in bc, mostly alliance in wotlk.
---
I’m going horde again, I’ve always ended up back on horde even though if you probably added up all my time on either faction I was probably alliance longer. Which is crazy to me because I just thought about it.
---
Hmm..... the races never bored me. I just love pvp and ganking and it always just aligns with the horde for me.
---
I dunno where I’m going with this.
---
I hate the "cost-cutting" argument. It's not true. At all. That's not how servers work anymore. More servers =/= more money, because servers are all virtualized now. You're welcome to argue about why you think layering is bad, but it's frustrating trying to argue with someone going into the argument with a bad faith (and incorrect) assertion of "ITS 100% BAD, NO WAY AROUND IT AND THEY KNOW IT, ITS JUST A SACRIFICE THEY MADE TO SAVE MONEY".
---
Imp don't auto attack.
---
Imp casts Firebolt or whatever its called.
---
You can set it to auto cast so he keeps casting on your enemy. You do this by clicking the ability icon in the pet's abilities bar.
---
Blizzard said this week they're announcing the server rules around the time name reservations start.  So you're both clueless but I'll make the popcorn.
---
HAHA, I guess you were on Barov or it's probably people doing that stuff on every stress server lol. We were kinda laughin about it in guild chat. Had the odd one or two people actually asking stuff though cuz they had never played in Vanilla.
---
Yup
---
Please tell me there is footage of Soda having his glaive taken away
---
Yes same
---
If i as an undead wanna come gank your rp event then you better pvp me or im not stoppin.
---
I never thought Trump would be president of the United States either but look where we are...
---
That's completely contradictory to everything I've read and they were certainly allowed the first time around.
---
But the thread was made because o p read a certain number of other people talking crap about streamers. They did not want to ask those people individually so they made their own thread haha
---
Hah same. And of course the 'anal' words have started as well. lol
---

Trust me when I tell you, we don't.   
---
Some of us out there will camp you for hours, using anything at our disposal, to take NOTHING from you. Only to give you one thing. Frustration  
---
Does this make me a toxic player? Sure
---
At the end of the day it's what I enjoy doing and I will continue to do it.
---
Got a link for that? Because even when the old roleplaying rules about OOC were up, Blizzard didn't enforce them.
---
Hell ya! Actually some of the streamers are really nice. I mainly just can’t Asmogold, what a douche. Would love to Dedicate my gaming to tanking him and see him cry
---
I had my hunter pet but out a few times to not assist while on defensive. I didn't really troubleshoot it, just switched to playing with it on passive - probably better in the long run anyway.
---
Your original point, and the one I responded to, was that Warlocks have a unique hassle that other classes do not have that will result in people not playing them.  That hassle, according to you, is farming shards.
---
My response, again, is that you literally never have to farm shards.  You never have to go out and specifically spend time farming shards.  You simply get them while you are doing anything else you would normally do.  You will never be out of shards, unless you don't know how to play Warlock.  You will never be in a position that you have to go spend time before raid farming up shards to be prepared.  You will always have shards, unless you are playing the class wrong.
---
That is my response to you.  You have said that Warlocks will be underrepresented because of this, and I am saying you are wrong.  There is no evidence to support what you have claimed, other than the fact that you seem to think there is an issue when there isn't one.
---
And once again, I will lol at you because you get the 16 slot bag when you get your felhunter.  You get the 12 slot bag when you get your succubus.  If class quests are the reason you don't play a class, then you must not be familiar with most classes having them.  This is, again, irrelevant to the point you tried to make about how farming shards creates additional work that Warlocks must do to prepare.
---
They are free to play make believe and call it whatever they want, but no amount of mental gymnastics makes anything in this game worthy of being called "world first".
---
Yeh I dunno bro, good luck supplementing that respec and retrain cost as a hpal for 2 days or as a rpal for 5 days. 
---
Not trying to rain on your parade it’s just not realistic in vanilla.
---
thats weird, i remember waiting at aq gates and dark portal with hundreds of people.
---
is there a reaction of when he gets the glaived removed? would love to see that
---
Blizzard please fix this atrocity!
---
Had the same feeling! Wanted to roll a dwarf priest but couldnt stand the thought of playing alongside gnomes, humans and elves.
---
What were you saying?
---
Asmongold Net Worth – $2 Million
---
Asmongold is a popular streamer on Twitch from the United States whose real name is Zack. He has an estimated net worth of $2 million. His content is mainly streaming the popular game called World Of Warcraft, a game he started playing during the summer of 2006.May 19, 2019
---
I hate streamer privilege.  
---
Hurting the gaming community.
---
Absolutely love this guide, it worked perfectly with 2 characters getting to 15.  I was ahead by a level or so because I did class quests but I don't mind that too much as I would rather be over leveled than under leveled  First one that seemed to fit my leveling style.  Are there any upgrades or new features planned for release.  I'm not saying there needs to be any, I am just curious.  Thanks a ton for this work!
---
That was about the same in Teldrassil earlier in the aft too. People were just being civil and friendly. Aside from one assclown who started spamming, pretty sure everyone reported him. Prob caught a ban from that, like there's not gonna be GMs or whatever around for stress test.
---
I've played with massive streamers in other MMO's unknowingly and can honestly say it was a complete shit show. Their fanbase were not rude, quite polite, but having 1 person hit a zone with a couple hundred followers killed the zone, I know achievements should not exist in 1.12 because they were implemented in TBC, but quest farming? shot to shit until they leave, gathering? forget it until they leave, if they are pvp'ers then forget standalone world pvp, they will be fed and protected by the fanboy masses as a disciple of the pixel cult.  The other issue I saw was the over population of the server at the start and then it abruptly died when said streamer moved on to another platform, also in effect killing the local economy. Oh you need xyz for your profession but streamer is also doing said profession, his fanbase will be out farming for them. Anyone lucky enough to farm whats needed will have astronomical prices on the AH. These are just a few of the things I've personally witnessed. I don't care which server they play on, it's their choice, I just wish they would do the community a favor and proclaim where they are going so I personally can avoid the shit storm fanbase that grovels at their feet every minute of their stream.
---
Ok.
---
Jolto?
---
But MY number is cooler than YOUR number
---
Glad you understand.
---
set pet to passive and bind scroll up to attack and scroll down to follow. now you have full control over that little bugger lol.
---
I'll try to say this in the nicest way, but I hope that if you choose RP-PvP over PvP that you have some level of interest in RP or at the very least respect role players and their choice to role play. If not, what's the point of not just going PvP?
---
Are you saying that you prefer memes that aren't repeated? I don't think that qualifies as a meme.
---
This is the turmoil I find myself in
---
Yes. I was doing it too on Druid and even Pally because ppl run OOM so easy on caster classes even.
---
It's world first Classic kills. Idk what kind of weird gatekeeping you're trying to do here.
---
He said he’d use the beta as a test to see if it would be feasible for him to go PvP.

Back in vanilla I always heard about that croc but could never find him.
---
IIRC, this isn't a bug, this is how pets worked in Vanilla. 
---
If your pet is set to defensive it will only attack something that attacks you, otherwise you have to manually command your pet to attack.
---
As stated, Moonglade is a neutral place regardless. It is a place where druid's are all at peace. 
---
As for quests, they are similar but different for Horde and Alliance. So you will not be competing for the same spots. (I know this is a fact for the Bear form quest and swimming one but I'm not sure how it is for Cat form).
---
I don’t understand how this makes the game unplayable. I understand that streamers will be on most of it all servers
---
sure it does, they hold the olympics and new seasons of football every year, new game, new season, new records.
---
Why there may not be rules there is etiquette that people try to follow and maintain on RP servers. Naming policy both for personal names and guilds will be reported. Its also common courtesy to respect others RP including RP events between factions. Trade and general chat should as much as possible only be game related.
---
didn’t actually happen. made up rumour
---
I believe so. And also it seems like US East people might be claiming Herod since the major streamers have decided to be so hush hush / indecisive about which realm they're playing on. I'm going to edit the post you replied to in order to reflect that
---
Nochanges!
---
Bruh think of all the wow tokens people will exchange in retail to buy gold on classic server. Or Carrie's and stuff like that. They're gonna be rolling in money. 😂
---
Both options are somewhat bad.
---
Option1: You dont have enough servers (which ppl think is currently the case).
---
Option2: You need to merge later.
---
But I think Option2 is so much better because there is at least a chance a new fresh server options - which probably would never happen if we start with 50 servers.
---
## bruh 💪🔥🔥🤙😂
---
Dunno why I’m getting so many downvotes, my comment was specifically aimed towards the kid that’s gonna corse camp the scrubs when in reality they can’t beat the streamers in a duel much less corpse camp them lol
---
I watch fairy tail.   I can appreciate anime fan service, but this image is just kind of cringe.   I think it might be a combination of the image and text.

What fraud thing?
---
Nvm just had to right click his fire bolt... lol
---
I didn't actually read it, so idk what you said. Sorry.
---
I have the same mouse and have started having this issue lately too. Happens in retail also.
---
I've never even seen this happen in retail in a group. I've seen it happen all the time solo and when changing groups.
---
They are the only acceptable ally race haha
---
No shock there.
---
It's not necessarily how retail sharding works.
---
I've had some really bizarre experiences with it. Looking back at Legion for example when they had seperate PVE and PVP servers:
---
* Group leader was on PVE realm
---
* 4/5 of group was on PVE realm and in the same guild
---
we invited a fifth guy who was on a pvp realm and we all got phased onto the pvp realm into a pack of 30 people of the opposite faction.

From real vanilla, atleast supposedly. Gets put into combat immediatly when projectile fires. From https://youtu.be/4ui6mf3lHSU?t=248
---
DA/RUIN EVERYTHING
---
I’d be willing to bet 15 in 6 hours or less will be the top 1-2% of classic players. That’s not a “without even trying” time for people who don’t practice doing sad 1-15 runs.

I think it was some wow pvp team that got bought out by NRG. He probably saw that it was failing and sold out the player contracts and folded before it costed him too much money.
---
My husband and I met on Wow in 2005 when I was 11 and he was 14. We started dating ehen I was 13 and he was 16. People said we were stupid and would end up unhappy. We planned and were long distance until I turned 18 and we moved in together. We got married in 2017 when I was 23 after I graduated college before grad school. We played the game all through vanilla , TBC, wotlk, and some cata before stopping. Now it's 2019, 12 years after we started dating and we can't wait to do it together again.
---
Right? Like how you didn't read my post and I had to literally break it down for you.

That was fun.

this is how ive done pet controll also. its very efficient, i even had sac/silence/seduce on clicking mouse wheel

---
Hey friend, I just wanted to let you know that the idea of "alpha" and "beta males" actually has no scientific basis when it comes to humans.
---
In fact, this idea came from a study done on wolves in the 1940s; a study which the author admitted to being inaccurate in 1999 due to a false interpretation of incomplete data.
---
I hope you found this enlightening
---
Being a multi millionaire doesn't mean you have to make millions a year...
---
And here we see you continue to try to distract.  Remember how you said that farming shards was a hassle?  Let's talk about that again.
---
I'd love for us to have two pvp servers.. or one pvp and one rp-pvp.  Purely so i can have one of each faction on a pvp server
---
Agreed. Gotta filter the garbage players.
---

That's some EVE Online type shit.

Either way I’m going rogue with engineering. Good luck everybody else!
---
A single person rolling on a streamer server will have zero affect on the streamer
---
A single largely popular streamer can roll on a server and dramatically affect the experience of everyone else.
---
Jesus I think you're confused and most likely forgot that you're on r/classicwow
---
I don’t see the problem, it’s HIS guild he can do whatever he wants you don’t have to join him?
---
Is that real?
---
15 days after launch is pretty easy if you take time off like most people serious about the pushing. Surprised it’s not 8-10 days.
---
The guards won in the end
---
Welp. Time to get ganked and "jajajajaja" spammed to death. Just give these guys their own server...
---
[I thought he was a knob before.....jeeze.](https://youtu.be/bz6P0S-J45M?t=23)
---
Before he was known for gaming, TipsOut owned and ran a company that did construction work for public projects in California called FTR International. That company had legal disputes filed against them on EVERY contract and used to send invoices for work that wasn't finished, wasn't correct, or simply not done at all. Whenever a small government committee would attempt not to pay, they'd get bullied into submission, often threatened with obscene personal litigation.
---
One such attempt at this "fraud" (just straight up thievery but with legal obscurity so as to not be outright criminal) was for almost $1 million dollars of taxpayer money. When the county board called him out on it and banned him and his company from ever holding contracts again, he threatened to sue the board members as individuals for "racism".
---
It eventually did go to court, he did try to play the race card, it became a long protracted legal battle that wasn't clear cut and initially was ruled in his favor, but on appeal, a judge told him to STFU and practically overnight, FTR International ceased to exist, forcing him into millions of personal debt.
---
Note: the only reason I'm not linking to proof is because the court records contain TipsOut's IRL name and even when a quick google search can produce the same results, doxxing someone on Reddit isn't cool or allowed.
---
Just repeat the names each night before you go to sleep.
---
&gt; Remember how you said that farming shards was a hassle? 
---
Because it is, we've been over this. I'd say go reread my posts, but it'll probably be your first time actually looking at them.
---
I don't know, I understand Blizzard's thought process here. Adding new servers is simpler and creates less issues than merging underpopulated servers.
---
Yes I agree. I was just using it as an example of the entitled selfishness they have sometimes which they and their followers have sometimes. The "blacklist" they tried to make is a good example
---
That's really fucking bad
---
They started with it going to 12 and then 15 when stress test came out, then 60 by the time release rolls around.
---
He's posted lots of (now deleted)racially charged and straight up racist things on reddit, on the account he's currently using even. 
---
Really bad player, known white supremacist, huge meme in the private server community.
---
What I don't get is why are Spanish speaking and Brazil players all picking US EST servers?
---
Yes it’s moronic when you lose an argument and try to resort to definitions, that go against you, to win.
---
Hi guys I just wanted to show how I was able to get ahead of the pack on the launch of the stress test. I was somewhere around the 10th person to hit level 15 on the PvP NA server, so I was not the best but I was not too far behind the fastest levelers for horde side. I will be using the same path come the launch of Classic in just 16 days, and I am so hyped that I can barely sleep at night, I just lay up thinking about Classic! I can't wait to start venturing Azeroth with you all.
---
Honestly as long as I can avoid soda and asmongold I’m fine. The other big streamers I’ve seen seem more chill and genuinely interested in developing a community and events, which could be really healthy for a server. Those two though...
---
Holy shit, that fucking mongoloid loser trying to act hardcore.  lol
---
this. I haven't made a new character in WoW in ages and I was surprised, and saddened, how quickly you can level up these days. You can pretty much bypass most of the old continents. Makes you wonder what that stuff even wastes space on your harddisk.
---
You fought demons in space with mechs.
---
That was good enough for me.
---
I played some alliance and horde during stress test. Alliance general was 200 people spaming "INVITE TO ASMON LAYER" while horde was fun conversation. I think in general it won't affect the game (especially after the first month or 2) but if you are in the zone he is in then general chat will be ruined and that can hinder enjoyment of the game.
---
Yeah...I feel like they should have enough of a stake in the community to just be front and center about it.
---
Sorry my dude, but as a fellow developer and someone that cares about the product and the final experience the customer receives, sharding is a huge design flaw and deterioration to the user experience. They should have either implemented it better, found other solutions, or just not have such a shitty system still in place. I haven't played since BC so but I'm sure they've had layering/sharding for a while now, so it surprises me they haven't got their shit together yet.
---
Same here. Just resubed yesterday. Less than 3 weeks left bois and gals!!!:)
---
#LOL It took HIM more than 6 hours to level to 15. He should be kicked from his whole guild, then. Fraudulent piece of shit.
---
Lol, IDK about the parenting but the grouping with people from those servers has made me crazy more than once. Played with people all over the world but man BR realms are like EVERY bad LoL game rolled into a dungeon.
---
I've been using this for the stress test and it's awesome. It shows good times to train and pick up weapon skills and buy weapons from vendor or craft a wand and how much linen to farm. The only issue I have is it doesn't have coordinates or directions so sometimes it's kind of a bitch if you don't know when a quest is inside of a cave or on a mountain or what side of a wall it's on, etc.
---
This will be their excuse to NOT remove layering, I guarantee it.
---
Not unless he has a time machine.  World first was 15 years ago.

1. more than one; many, especially variegated.
---
I'm out. Have fun in classic!
---
&lt;No Offense&gt; starts at 8:30 PST, and that's about the latest I've found.
---
But in general, raiding with a PST guild is OP's best bet.
---
Last I heard, they wanted Eastern Servers. It's a mutually beneficial statement
---
I mean they really could if they wanted to. Not sure what the negative fallout would be if they did do it.
---
But--won't that actually increase the odds that your experience is a successful one? Neckbeards are the best beards in MMOs.
---
Your only logic is that people won't be on at all times and you seem to be having a very hard time grasping that there are high volume times where a majority will be on.
---
Sharting can cause layering, trust me
---
Most people here are looking for the exact same experience as the first time wow came out. Streamers weren’t a thing back then and having several hundred people at the will and call of one streamer is a very significant change that can cause drastic differences in gameplay experiences should you encounter them. 
---
First thing that comes to mind is world events/pvp. Those were some of the crown jewels of vanilla. A lot of why they were so great was because they were (somewhat) evenly balanced and fair. Now imagine if asmond and his alliance gang roll in with twice the number as the horde. The whole dynamic has changed and what used to be an interesting gameplay experience is now doused by the streamers advantage of having clear communication to 100+ players. 
---
It’s gonna make things different this time around. Nobody knows how much different or even if it’ll be worse. Humans are averse to change. This is an understandably big change.
---
Maybe the races themselves are boring, but the zones are way more varied. Playimg horde is like which gradient of desert do you prefer?
---
Biggest exception being Mulgore, might run a Tauren at some point. God I love that area.
---
You're the real MVP.
---
They're not world first because they didn't kill the fucking boss first. That's not gatekeeping, that's stating a simple fact. World first is a zero sum game...it gatekeeps itself automatically. And it has been shut for a long time. 
---
Gatekeeping is like if I said that someone's opinion on classic doesn't matter because they only played it on pservers.  It's not allowing someone access to an identity / experience / community because of something that isn't necessarily of intrinsic value. 
---
Me acknowledging a very simple fact is not preventing people from having fun racing to boss kills, and I encouraged people to call it whatever they want. But it's not world first.
---
sign me the fuck up, whos in for the Anti Streamer Defense Force?
---
ASDF!!!  (that abbreviation has the nice bonus of being easy to type)
---
Duskwood kind of tough for a level 15 toon
---
It's extremely easy to tell if someone is stream sniping. Chance has been dealing with this for years, he's not just going to blacklist everyone that kills him once.
---
I already have you the vocabulary definition of several. 
---
And meriam agrees.
---
Spoilers: 2 isn’t several.
---
That's fine to think that way. But there's literally zero way to enforce this other than ganking the streamer 24/7. Just "declaring" that a certain server will not have any streamers on it means literally nothing.
---
Probably
---
 
---
Even  if you could kill rag in the 1st week, all  you've proven is that you  found like 80 people with no life, and organized them together to do  something rather trivial.   I guess in a way that is an accomplishment,  but not one that should be respected.
---
it is not a bug. it is because vanilla doesn't have assist 'stance' like retail. only defensive, aggressive and passive. the best you will get is defensive stance where your pet automatically attacks when you or it is damaged. you can also macro in '/petattack' into your spells and it will have the same effect as the assist stance in retail.
---
"He's a multimillionaire"
---
"NO HE'S NOT!"

"He literally has multiple millions of dollars. That's what multiple means."
---
"HAHA LOSER YOU'RE RESORTING TO DEFINITIONS! That means I win!"
---
I can tell you are a very sociable person who makes lots of friends.
---
What he doesn't seem to get is that not everyone is a streamer and therefore can't play all day.
---
Are people not allowed to kill streamers?
---
That awkward moment when you're running cath and can't kill the last boss
---
I don't think anyone here has much of a problem with people who like to stream the game for fun, and have a smaller following. It's the streamers who will have 1k+ fans following them around causing issues (like anton_o listed) that people want to avoid.
---
If thats you, I think most people would rather you didn't stream classic WoW because it causes community issues that weren't present in the original iteration of the game (which is what a lot of people are trying to recreate). But if you are consistently getting 50-100 viewers (or less) and are streaming because you enjoy it, you aren't going to cause any problems and no one is going to care.
---
Which is why i literally have a list of 35 different names alreafy prepated:)
---
DRUID GANG
---
Yeah I’m seeing a 60/40 favoring horde but that was only 5k responses
---
Wow that guy doesn't seem like a total cunt at all...
---
By definition he isn’t. I literally showed that according to meriam Webster and vocabulary he’s wrong.
---
Also no, it’s the fact he resorted to definitions, THAT GO AGAINST HIM. 
---
But I guess reading is hard for people not actually looking at the text.
---
to be completely honest i'd be willing to bet there'd be more fans trying to camp them for stream time over running next to them and spouting random bullshit or trying to be a body guard
---
can we stop using "Toxic" to describe "things I don't personally like"?
---
Except this time instead of playing against another NFL team, you are facing off against the peewee league.
---
Mwahaha the downvotes. People are in for a very rude awakening. 
---
Yeh man, I fully support your cause, if you aren’t respeccing and your guild let’s you come along, you can definitely double dip with some success.
---
I’m afraid that the community at large isn’t going to be friendly to meme specs, but I’m optimistic that they will. 
---
Naxx is no joke tho, and while it may be a small percentage of people that get there and to that point, meme specs aren’t going to fly.
---
My mind is already at the end end game and focused on Naxx as that’s my white buffalo. Call me tunnel visioned but I won’t support bringing any meme specs after I helped gear 8 fucking tanks for one boss. Spend the gold and commit or go farm herbs.
---
Really feels like fear of the unknown. People will give a hundred and one different reasons but it really comes down to the fact that big streamers advertising and being a huge server presence was not a thing 15 years ago. So now, people can spout Doom and Gloom series all they want but they really have no idea how popular streamers being on a server will affect a game like classic. They usually extrapolate based on what they know of streamers in other popular games. But classic is not like other popular games. The community is different. It's a different kind of game and so the streamer effect on the community will be different.
---
Or maybe they have this wild fear of thousands of players mobbing a streamer and running right through a player's path, killing everything in sight and ruining their fun. Once every minute or something.
---
Streamer deliberately builds a toxic community and shits on peoples fun and makes millions of dollars based on shitting up communities and encouraging followers to harass people to stir attention-seeking drama. 
---
People lose respect and don't want anything to do with them, shunning them from communities.
---
Your Dumb Ass: "rEspEcT gOEs bOth waYS buD"
---
🤣
---
I don't understand why they're planning to play on a PvP server.  The entire reason for PvE servers to exist is for babies like this guy to play on them and not have to interact with regular people.
---
At the end of the day, most streaming is targeted @ 11-16 year olds. Just like a lot of YT gaming content is. And regardless if Soda is or isn't like this IRL, it's what got him popular.
---
Yeah didn't know you couldn't skin pre level 5 I just had pserver experience doing that
---
Got to put all that excess nervous energy somewhere

---
They should take all the streamers and stick them on a server specifically for them. They have their own contained microcosm where they can rule their fanboy masses and it acts like a quarantine to keep them away from the rest of us who don't want to have anything to do with them.
---
I would just want them to NOT have layering in the Major Cities...They literally feel DEAD. There like a maximum of 8 people in Orgrimmar when i went there 2 hours into the stresstest :( That really made my classic hype go for a huge nosedive......Sure layer the questing zones etc but leave the big city hubs alone please...
---
Gawd damn these comments salty as hell.
---
Ah, nothing like building a guild to fight people that will ruin the game by making yourself play the game differently than you want, ruining the game for yourself.
---
Some things help, like skinning everything, having lots of bags space to loot EVERYTHING to vendor, and DONT get every ability at class trainers just cause you can. Some are not needed and that gold is much better saved for a mount.  
---
You should be around 100g at 40
---
Whoa, lets not pretend there's some kind of kinship between us and "them"
---
It's not exactly ridiculous to want to watch "x" play classic, and not classic but with fanboys.
---
Don't want to get treated like shit? Don't treat streamers like shit.
---
Classic is all about this kind of community stuff. The game is better because of it.. I mean, this "blacklist" situation is completely up to the players, whether they are streamers or not.
---
Can I get a link on this?
---

I am genuinely excited we have a choice, I remember playing on fire tree back in the day, at least here I have 2 choices and there it is don't need more than that.

I sure hope this is fake. Because it would only solidify my opinion of this guy to be an absolute tool.
---
Or maybe he had a legitimate question.
---
If only i was on west coast...
---
what is BR?
---
Blizzard must have buzzword  psychologists on their marketing team.
---
I still cringe at the "agency" movement on retail.
---
He insinuated that someone who ganked him was a loser who had nothing else and was on welfare.
---
Self descriptive?
---
The addon "Spy" works well for this, not sure if it's working for classic though.
---
I seriously could never understand this. The camping for mobs early and figuring out a way to get past the wall of people are some of the best parts of early server launch experience and people want it gone because it's *inconvenient* and *time consuming* ? Like, it's fucking classic if you want convenience and don't want to waste time go play retail it's there(and abandoned) for a reason.
---
like are you mad that you won't get server firsts or to be the scarab lord or something?
---
This happened in classic. I remember specifically the outpost as you entered into WPL had this happen.
---
This is a 200 IQ move to get the streamers to roll Herod out of spite, finally settling the matter of where they go.
---
Long live the human paladin!

Trolls would like a word.

Hah! Caught one!
---
This level of tryharding will absolutely destroy classic for anyone partaking in it. The game back then was fun because it was an adventure, this is just cancer
---
I feel its fair to ask the community to help advertise itself. Not like I'm forcing them to do anything, was a simple request.
---
looks so fun! i want to be a part of this!!

---
That's not a good-faith argument and you know it. It's pedantic crap. The only difference is that the bosses are easier because people have been killing them for over a decade. 
---
I have no problem with people clarifying that their world first kills are in fact world first *classic* kills. Hell I have no problem with people even pretending they're just as impressive as Azshara or w/e. Whatever floats your boat.

Still not world first.

Is there a targeted server for the Spanish-speaking community? Asking in a non-toxic way b/c I might end up rolling there.
---
This is only reddit population though.
---
They are creating populated servers though through a low amount of servers through layering and creating more realms later if need be. Like you said, though, you can't make everyone happy.
---
Are you under the impression that people are claiming to attempt world first rag *ever*? Everyone knows that every boss died in retail vanilla. No one is claiming to be the first to ever see a rag kill. Obviously they're talking about *Classic world firsts*. 
---
If anything, you're the one arguing in bad faith, pretending that people are claiming something that they aren't.

“Gala de Deus” só pelo seu nick ja sei qual seu nível de maturidade, é um absurdo você trazer uma opinião tão tosca enquanto estamos sofrendo ataques xenofóbicos e generalizados.

---
Just wondering, what bag mod are you using? Looks like bagnon but it didn't work for me.
---
Do you mean option one is better? With option two you'd be taking away servers not creating new ones.
---
"THE STREAMERS!"
---
World file size is irrelevant to how many people can play on a server at once. It’s also a bit moot anyway because with layering Blizz can expand server capacity for each realm by scaling horizontally. So the population support for each server doesn’t really matter.
---
Don't play. We have only few servers. There is no place for long time addicted players.
---
Just release a classic updated version today
---
that's true. It's pretty much a fail in game design if everyone rushes to the top level because only there is content that is actually played by others. But that doesn't change the fact that all those zones are just there, bare of players, eating up disk space. Blizz even went so far to redo them in Cata. But the effect is still the same. Those zones are just dead and mostly useless.
---
It’s to attempt to repel them to let them know they aren’t welcome
---
The narcissist point is dead on man. Tips makes OK content and was actually one of the first people I found a year ago when I started getting hyped for classic. I don't hate him or anything but I noticed this guy would ALWAYS give this smirk in his videos whenever he was on camera. Like the guy literally smiles every time he sees his own reflection. 
---
Not saying that is some kind of crime or anything but... I'd never trust or befriend someone like that.
---
Get as geared as you like you won’t 1v6 fresh 60’s
---
I can’t wait to make a rogue on the opposite faction and follow this guy around for the next 5 years.

nobody has money to pay for it though.

Friends and guilds can move together if they offer free transfers.

I feel bad for the players who would really attempt to give in to his demands/expectations, all for the chance to join his guild and play the game with him.
---
Classic WoW is suppose to be fun and welcoming, but streamers like this are slowly turning the community into toxic waste. Sad.
---
Streaming in Eve Online is really stupid, information is everything. A lost ship represents a lot more than a 2 minute corpse run.
---
Yo don’t get in a all in a tizzy cause a lot of nervous Nelly’s and technical Terry’s are in here posting what they think is the right way to play.
---
please don't let any relevant facts get in the way of irrational streamer hate
---
because as you know in America you are personally responsible for every bad thing that anyone in your family ever did.
---
Something he said in a heated moment. He isn’t even streaming for classic launch and some time beyond. Quit letting these people live rent free in your heads and move on.
---
&gt; By the time most players are level 60 layering will be gone and your server will only have 2500-3k online at a time at most.
---
11 NA servers x 3,000 = 33,000
---
...You really think NA will have "at most" 33,000 players online after most players hit 60? I get your point, blacklisting might have an effect, but I think you are really underestimating the numbers here.

If you play smart and don't waste your money in new gear from AH, you get your mount at 40. Maybe with some leftover gold even.

this is even better than the glory days of SomethingAwfuls Goons

That only goes as far as discord use goes. Not everyone playing will be using discord. Just like how the opinion of this sub doesn't speak for the entire community for most things.

You realize there is no scarab lord title in vanilla, right?

Mike TV, Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory

Where you level 15 when you were taking 3 level 5 mobs as a warrior? I'll be levelling one as my first 60. My body is ready for the pain.
---
What do you mean? He is the best warrior dueler NA. Just ask anyone on henhouse. Definitely no Kappa
---
Cat form there is no quest and you just learn it at level 20 like any other skill.
---
The aquatic form quest is different for both horde and alliance, but similar in different zones.
---
The same goes for their poison cleanse skill quest. They are similar but different in completely different zones.
---
Maybe your right, they wouldn't be the worst though.
---
I'm not a fan of Lutris or any Wine front-ends; I like being in as much control of things as possible :p I've ran WoW at various points with just plain Wine (Staging).

It's been a little while since I've tested this (worked fine with BfA; I'll likely try this out again in a day or so), but [here's my notes on how I've gotten Retail WoW running on Linux](https://wiki.realmofespionage.xyz/games:wine:world_of_warcraft).

Here is part 2 of that video

I have played in many private servers where players from South America and Spain play together, so I think that a Spanish speaking server will be a good solution.
---
It's annoying all around frankly,  low effort trolling that generally leads to spam and pointless arguing/angst.  Open chat channels are best turned off imo.
---
Well, it can't eve be done without an army helping your or just straight cheating, so no, there's nothing to be proud of in this accomplishment.

Lmao the victim mentality on this sub is wild

This is photoshopped isn't it? 
---
This is the guy that organized the duel tourney for the sole purpose of self-exclusion because he couldn't hold a candle to those that didn't even make it out of the first bracket. Anyone who's watched any of his classic gameplay content knows this.

An extra hour is a massive amount of time for 1-15. Yes if he said sub 5 hour that would be absurd.

I feel like most of the wands where found in dungeons. But a few do come from quests.
---
nah bro its not about following wat they say, i just cant stand this fucking toxic bullying the goes on in this subreddit. i dont even watch the guy. but he cant even post something in his personal guild server without getting scrutinised? come on this is just pure hate
---
Exactly
---
Yeah it's pretty retarded. What's annoying about it is that you can't really disprove it and if you say anything to the contrary of it, the person dispensing that excuse isn't going to change their mind anyway.
---
But the fact of the matter is, if this is consistently how he acts, even if originally it may have just been for show.. this is how he consistently acts. It's like saying "bruh" ironically at first and then not so ironically after some time.
---
Most people are hanging around in the starter areas in the stress test. There's not really a need to go to orgrimmar until you're ready for rfc, especially two hours into the stress test. Two hours in and I was still in razor hill/senjin as a hunter.
---
The alliance defias storyline is really good.
---
On the other hand, if it's taken out when there are still 20-30k concurrent users across all of a server's layers, that will kill the server too.
---
Uh oh... I have some bad news for you. Brazilians laugh haha and they'd rather play with muricans than hispanics.
---
I legit feel the group of people behind this whole thing are prbly just as toxic.  It is very ironic while reading all the posts I wouldn't want to play with them on their server either. I feel it's almost border on the level of some kind of supremist type shit.   
---
Makes the streamer communities look more tame than they claim, pretty meesed up shit actually.
---
Gang shit
---
There's no perfect way to do this, that's for sure.
---
Does a clip of sodas reaction to this exist? Pretty please
---
Same request here. 2K. 2560x1440 please and thank you! (Looking around haven't found it yet if it's available.)
---
Especially 2 hours in. Why would anyone go to org after two hours? I'd imagine 99% of people are either in the valley or razor hill at that point
---
Streamer privilege is insane to me. People literally will be lining up to give him gold and very good items.
---
It was *moved* in WotLK.  In classic it was in plaguelands.
---
90% whoooosh here
---
The only people raging are the people getting angry with me for answering their trolling questions.
---
What's next, blacklisting hunters because their tracking ability gives them an unfair advantage of knowing where players are?
---
Damn when you put it that way
---
Does it make you feel better? That slight rush of dopamine? I can tell you're an angry person, no happy person replies to people 2-3 times repeatedly and is angrily waiting to reply within seconds of posting, and goes around mass reporting posts that make him look bad. No happy person obsessively gets into semantical arguments to desperately eek out the slightest win on the internet at 12:42AM on a Saturday. This will never make you happy or whole. You will never shame people into being forced to tolerate your behavior. Happy people walk away from things, but it seems you are just obsessed with being angry. So if one of us has to be the adult and walk away, keep it real chief.
---
Why cant the brazilians and spanish speaking countries form a pact and merge into one server? I know its two different languages but my brazilian and mexcan friends say they can understand eachother so it wouldn't be too bad.

Yah its not, his viewers are 20-28 ish

Feral Druid or Fury/Arms warrior. Just don’t level as a prot war

Hahaha, I'm trying not to!  Even I was getting sucked into what is "best" to play, because my mind still isn't fully made up on what to play.  Just trying to put out some good vibes into the community ;D

Onebag3
---
That tube connected from his mouth to his gut .... is this some kind of human centipede thing? Trying to write it out has me throwing up in my mouth a bit ...

Yes, and they only have to sacrifice any other sense of server community to do it!
---
You should complies this into a YouTube mix :)
---
Russle jimmies. I like it
---
For good reason...

How does it feel to lick soda’s dick? Do you think he’ll finally cum in your mouth one day so you can finally guzzle all that cum you’re feening for?
---
weird, I also have onebag3 but it wasn't working on my end. I'll try to look for a different version I guess. Thanks.
---
Also a good option and fun to play with. I just like VMware to quickly hop between distros, but it is a bit of a resource hog if your hardware is a bit older/slower.
---
That's how he makes his gamer Grob bath water.
---
Remember, Activision is Blizzard. They won't do shit to fix anything. This is a convenient cash grab. Good luck to those still playing their games.
---
Bruh.... you’re right.
---
Really wish the mods would address the stream man bad circle jerk that’s been going on for months. It has totally ruined this subreddit. Just make a megathread or something so I don’t have to sift through the salt to find discussion of people talking about things they actually enjoy.
---
So you're telling me there aren't going to be good to very good raiding guilds that don't give two shits about streamers? I know streamers have a lot of influence, I am not naive, but there will be plenty of guilds that don't give a rats ass about some blacklist some obnoxious streamer throws out there.
---
Never forget
---
https://i.imgur.com/cx1TLIv.jpg

u do realise that people join his guild under the premise that its on the hardcore side? do u realise that this was a screenshot from his personal GUILD discord. u people want any excuse to hate and its sad.

When I get home I can send you a link to the one I use

## bruh 😤😜😝🤤💯
---
You fist those randoms!
---
I would if it wasnt PVP :/ Mankrik it is for me :/
---
Truth
---
Why? 
---
It's like everyone forgot that WoW vanilla was a fun game.  It's the game that provided the momentum for one of the biggest games in history.  So many people enjoyed it back in the day, the idea that people won't enjoy it now and less than 20% will stick around after two months seems Naive at best.  
---
The game hasn't become less fun in the last 15 years just because retail has changed or other games came out.
---
Minimum rank always
---
Good bot
---
The BR trolls are the only ones who make it about their country of origin. It's incredibly weird. Like I've said, it seems like a point of pride for them to be specifically a Brazilian prefer of shit, not*just* a piece of shit lol.
---
Either way you have to form a new server community. If you merge servers you got a bunch of new players and a bunch of previous players on the server. It's the same way with server transfers. At least with the second option you have a choice.
---
I would personally like to see them get griefed until they're unable to even play on any server and they completely quit the game.
---
Eh do what you want mane. Sure there are options that are more/less effecient than others but rock what you want and make it your own. 
---
Shit, shamans can even tank if you do it right. Have fun and be the best crazy weird tank build that you make. Thats the point of vanilla.
---
My G305 goes insane sometimes, make sure there's no hair over the sensor.
---
LOL. Is this guy serious with this shit?
---
The closer the release day of classic comes, the more I hate those streamers I liked to watch the content from.
---
With each of their statements they step in the next clanger. It‘s pathetic.
---
They released names of servers they won’t roll on and general forums decided not to choose either of those. Pretending to be a victim doesn’t make you one.
---
Well, it can't eve be done without an army helping you or just straight cheating, so no, there's nothing to be proud of in this accomplishment. It's like a rich kid winning a race, because he has a better car.
---
#Walletsout
---
Ya kargoz is pretty chill and fully dedicated to classic. Still, what happens when the next retail x-pac drops and most classic streamers jump ship. Their fans will jump too and the servers they used to play on would become ghost towns.
---
So much for vanilla I guess
---
I think you are GREATLY underestimating how many people will be playing classic wow in 3 months.
---
&gt;I'm sure this has been said in multiple ways here on reddit, and plenty of other places... but I frankly don't see it enough.
---
It's been said every possible way and I see it every hour
---
&gt; (But we can gank gold bots together in the wilds.)
---
Well that one place where cross faction collusion is acceptable.
---
Why don’t you want to be on a server with streamers?
---
Bringing population is good no?
---
[Yeah, I don't think I will take what you say seriously.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/copfea/why_dont_people_want_to_play_with_streamers/)  He seems like a child and what the ever loving fuck is with the first comment on that post.
---
I think the hardcore PvE community in vanilla pservers, and now in classic, is mostly about speedrunning. That's the impression I got anyway. You have guilds competing for fastest raid clears, fastest 1-60, fastest rag kill. Which makes sense, as the speedrunning community generally gravitates towards older games.
---
I don't think it's more or less impressive than real world first, though. It's a different kind of achievement.
---
I don't know why you guys don't want to roll on their server. Camp them 24/7.
---
Back in vanilla we would sit in an almost full group for at least an hour for some dungeons. Can’t wait.
---
Maybe because I don't intend to no-life this game by any stretch of imagination I am more indifferent to streamers as all I really want from classic is to find my own fun for however long I can be on.
---
Na dude, 99.99% attrition rates.
---
Do you really think that kids these days have the attention spans to play a game like Classic, and the millennials with kids and houses can play while they have that massive student loan debts? Fucking millennials and Zoomers destroying the world!
---
/s
---
Do you think if let's say 100 people are mimicking this on your same server it will still work? will the dynamic respawn still favor this strat?
---
I’m so confused wtf is layering
---
Epic. And no lag/freezing players like we used to see in big raids like this on previous stress tests. Although this seems to be less players than some of those laggy raids.
---
the funniest part is people literally cream their pants when they see an opportunity to hate on someone. look at this thread, it makes me sad that this is what this community is.
---
"Twitch_Yine" what are you some 0 viewers failed streamer or something ?
---
Do people forget that after binging WoW for a month straight that you slow down... then slow down more... until you come to this realization that you've just spent the last 2 months doing nothing and you  wished you had been more productive in other things. That's when you stop playing WoW for 2-3 months until you become overwhelmed and depressed with whatever you were trying to be productive on, and revert back to playing WoW again in an endless loop. Buying 6 months at a time is counter-intuitive to this cycle. Noobs.
---
Then make it not BR? If general forums has the clout to make people roll on Herod they can choose to do so on any realm.
---
Blizz plz handle these streamers!
---
Their impact flies in the face of what the community wants and what you have recreated. Please designate a streamer server for them and their followers. 
---
They will disrupt and suck the life out of any server they choose, leaving your loyal customers in despair.
---
It's been well over a decade pattern at this point. Hell basically two decades now. It's not a small enough minority to be condemning based off a few bad eggs. It's been a constant theme throughout many years and games. Like I told the guy in the BR discord post I wish them the best and hope they're able to control the toxicity and make it better this time around but they have the burden of proof.
---
You fucking did it man. 
---
Guys, the streamers aren’t going to play Herod. Tokyo_Life told them to fuck off, the day is saved!
---
way to change the topic for no reason. Your clearly a dumbass
---
Cool vid, only thing I didn't like was the music. It sounded like contra or something from NES
---
This will be my new home.
---
Is there any in-between of layering like this, and having 446897436 people camp one cactus apple?
---
Ironforge is the best city.
---
Humans are the best tanks.
---
Fear ward is better than tremor totem.
---
Thigh Inquisitor is all you need to know
---
This makes me feel like getting the server first kill on MC/ony out of spite just to rob him the satisfaction of it all.
---
When you start getting MP5 gear.
---
Sounds like it'd be fun for 30 minutes then what
---
&gt; Do people think they'll ever be able to get rid of layering with only 11 servers per region?
---
Thanks for spitting out a random statistic unrelated to the post.
---
The number of servers is irrelevant. 
---
The servers could simply do a check to see if you are friends with/in a group with other players and prevent them from being separated.
---
I just wish my guild would hurry and decide so I can like and dislike certain memes :o
---
To try to encourage new players to help fill out the population of a non-high pop server, as well as get new players kind of clustered together. In theory, new players have more fun with other new players.
---
I don't agree with your last point at all, but the speedrunning is a good way to look at it actually. Maybe if it were framed in terms of time and not "world first" it would irritate me less.
---
1) Yay more personal attacks. Instead of actual arguments.
---
2) Really? The age old U MAD BRO? You need new material.
---
3) I don’t live on the east coast like you do, bub.
---
4) And no you didn’t lay out any points. Infact all I’ve seen are personal attacks. And your “argument” has nothing to do with the whole definition thing. Your literally arguing off topic.
---
5) I literally never said community’s can’t police themselves. But the community can also call out the community for acting like entitled twats. And the community is never of 1 though process so people will disagree, either with the goals, the attitude of other community members, or the actions. 
---
6) Jesus Christ your ending statement is hilarious. Sorry bro you can’t take the high ground after making 2 posts that are straight up personal attacks, and the other where you open up on a personal attack and then argue off topic.
---
The stream man bad cesspool started the drama months ago. I can’t blame him for not telling the petty mob where to go to take his name lol
---
all good, I found a working one. Thank you though.
---
All the passives are minor except if you are going melee in raids, in which case +x to weapon mastery matters a great deal as  glancing blows is an issue due to monster level being higher than player level cap.
---
Completely, this is basically new content for Aussies/Kiwis, first time we can play classic like it was meant to be played.
---
I suppose every single person who is ever going to kill him in world PvP is a stream sniper to him huh
---
Going Herod horde as well, reporting for duty
---
Harvest their tears.
---
they already did that on the beta lol, based Richturpin
---
&gt; It shouldn't have to be like this
---
I will say my perception of BR players is entirely self inflicted from Dota 2. I'm avoiding Thalnos 100%. I have no doubts that there are great BR players that I'll be missing out playing with. But once bitten twice shy. I'm not trying to hear jajajajajajaja everytime some fuckhead ninja loots something with their group of buddies.
---
Holidays from work.
---
Yes, but only dodge chance in cat form, so it doesn't help to aid OPs feral tank end goals.
---
Seems salty. Chill out bro
---
I don't actually care too much either way about most streamers, but this guy is a complete and utter douche.
---
Well I guess there really are two types of people in this world: Right, and wrong.
---
Disgusting
---
Maybe but endgame is going to be very slowly paced out and very easy. Killing 5man, ZG, Molten Core and BWL with patch 1.12 characters is pretty faceroll. The best guilds in the world and streamers aren't going to have much advantage at all over anyone until Naxx...and even then it won't be insane because 75% of the bosses aren't that bad.
---
A Gank Guild won't be badly matched against streamers. Even if they outlevel most of us, you can still totally fuck with someone if you're 5 or 10 levels below.
---
FETCH THA SHOULDER STRETCHER.
---
Thing is he's friends with most of the streamers. The whole OSRS streaming community know eachother one way or another and the game simply doesn't get as 'heated' as wow pvp might.
---
Good old fashioned love makings
---
I sincerely hope this subreddit isn’t reflective of the in game community. A mass mob of toxic 30 year old adults fucking seething that people play the game differently than them. It’s pathetic.
---
Imagine calling someone a nerd on the Classic WoW subreddit lmao
---
Bloodsail Buccaneers sounds more noble and RP-like
---
...But Grobbulus is so bad it’s good. It’s the server that had to push back to exist, and it has a name suited for an underdog
---
I mean at least hes trying. If you play games for the pure enjoyment of it, dont hate on people who are trying to provide content to others they think might find enjoyment from it.
---
I'd bet everything I own that streamers will pop up on every server.
---

here ya go m8
---
Layering should be a prompt that gives you the option to transfer to a new layer, rather than forcing you to.
---
Right lol? I think I'll commit my raiding guild to go corpse camp streamers after raid is over
---
Don't tell me what to do
---
...Priests die way less than any warrior. Lol.
---
Legit the only good thing to come out of being an onceanic gamer we dont have to put up with these streamer kids and their posies
---
Anyone know if this is brought to blizzard yet? I wanna know their side. 
---
Worst thing would be to kill your nochanges game with changes like this. So off putting if this becomes as issue past level 30
---
I wonder if streamers will play on PVE servers. Otherwise complaining about getting ganked on a pvp server is pretty funny
---
ALL HAIL THE HYPNOTOAD
---
I thought the frost mages were basically CC bots. Fire mage crits are the PvP kings aren't they?
---
Didn't realize he decided to play. Last time I checked on him he was planning to play Classic offstream.
---
Oh what I said was, "Dynamic respawns existed in low level starting zones during vanilla". What you heard was, "The system that existed in vanilla was the same as dynamic respawns on pservers or that is in live currently."
---
It requires a very strong support team, yes. I think you underestimate the commitment, dedicated and coordination required to pull it off, though. No one gets carried in a week 1 rag kill. 
---
It's also an unprecedented kind of game play afaik. An entire guild (most likely around 100 players) pooling their resources and pushing the game to its extreme to get 40 people through what should be impossible. Imagine if someone told you back in vanilla that some day, some people would go from level 1 to killing Ragnaros in less than a week on a newly opened server. You'd think they were crazy. 
---
I don't know why some of you guys are so jaded. It's amazing to me that any group of people could go from 1 to rag in a week. 7 days! It's insane. Imagine killing boars in Durotar and 7 days later killing Ragnaros. I can't wait to see who gets it first and how many days it will take, actually.
---
first 15 seconds i noped out hard
---
I was arguing against people like you for months. And I finally agree. 
---
The popular streamers have the self awareness of a doorknob. They're never going to learn. I hope they are ganked every single time they login the game until they have to apologize to the community for sacrificing everything for content.
---
I'm giving my guildies bonus dkp for every streamer they gank
---
&gt; The problem is, you're part of the demographic that will never be pleased no matter what blizzard does.
---
That is absolutely false. I want Blizzard to do the bare minimum. If they go beyond that, great, but my requirement for satisfaction is extremely low.
---
I know what layering is "for", but it's cons are much much much bigger than it's pros, and there are better ways of dealing with population issues without damaging the community.
---
&gt; If the technology for layering existed in 2004, vanilla wow would have used it and it still would have been successful.
---
I highly doubt that. I doubt wow would even be around anymore if they used layering in 2004, because most people would just get bored and stop playing.
---
TIL ty
---
If he's indeed a streamer dont you find it funny he's making this shit topic telling other streamers to join a dif server? Come on now
---
It seems to be causing issues with other Classic addons at the moment. Addons like "EZ Junk" won't work because of Aux.
---
It's giving the error to either disable or ignore addons too.
---
You keep dragging in the fact that there's no sharding, for no reason. The OP was saying that there's a difference between playing directly with someone, as in the same group doing the same content, and someone that is just in the general area of someone else. Why he brought that up in the first place, who knows, but he wasn't saying anything about afking or avoiding people through sharding.
---
Creo que el server para latinos (no BR) va a ser Faerlina. Igual puedes checar el megathread con el cuestionario, ahí publicaron los datos y se ve en qué servidor va a haber más personas que hablen español.
---
Unpopular opinion: All these recent unpopular opinion posts are just popular opinion
---
can we stop assuming "toxic" is being misused? when used in connection with many streamers, it isn't.
---
I think were going to have layering be permanent.  Because 120k NA players is not realistic and thats what the servers are designed to hold if we're to have the stated goal of Vanilla pops.
---
Yeah there might be 500k at launch, but I'm expecting a heavy dropoff. Vanilla came out with a perfect storm, there was nothing like it at the time and it was most people's introduction to MMOs and online gaming in general bar Halo.
---
It's just a different climate now and vanilla isn't some mysterious, ever-changing landscape where you don't know what will come next, either. A lot of the fun in retail vanilla was not knowing what class changes might happen, what the next piece of content is (most people didn't keep up with updates until pretty close to patch releases, if at all), and even if they knew what content was coming out, it was nothing that anyone had experienced before. We aren't getting the same vanilla experience. The only way to do that is to give Blizz full control on a Classic + and even then people are just more computer and internet savvy than they were 15 years ago.
---
I think he means using charge with a shadowmelded warrior.
---
It has been almost 15 years... But from memory. If you start to selectively buy skills at 30ish. You'll have enough gold for it at 40.
---
Don't worry too much about it.
---
Does anyone have the clip of this?
---
It honestly feels like classic is doomed. Layering sucks, we got streamer drama everywhere, then your usual elitists, I'm honestly super worried about this game.
---
Honest question. What are you supposed to do about these people?
---
These are the idiots that accidentally rear end you at the grocery store bc they were on their phone and then scream at you.
---
He's also terrible at the game. No way is he going to manage his own raids successfully
---
Yeah that's not what that was my dude. I have personal experience with one of them and it was legit toxic. Sone of them are fine. Most of them idgaf about. But one of them who is somewhat popular here is a dick. Theres a difference between doing something "I don't personally like", and "doing something that pretty much anyone would agree is a shitbird thing to do, and ruins the game for nearly anyone it touches". I'm not going to say much more than that unless it's in PMs because there's still something there. But just because you arent aware of some shit behavior doesnt mean it doesnt exist.
---
I'm really happy when people talk about Wildstar.  RIP brother MMO.
---
so, its not 100% going to be announced. And if it is, it will be after they create their names and everyone is already creating names. Gives literally 0 time for people to plan on the servers. It literally screws everyone over. Im running a guild, and I want to give them a definite server, but I cant because the streamers are too selfish. Its literally unfair, with an EST server being all brazilians, and the other 2 both having leaks of being played. At this point its 50/50 to hope you dont get their server.
---
That's how its been since we crawled out of the cave. What screwed the whole thing up is civilization. No longer is the strongest and smartest caveman king of the tribe. Now it's a bugman sitting in an apartment with a camera in his face while he runs on a hamster wheel.
---
What's the story here? Been out of the loop for a few weeks.
---
I've considered it.
---
If one were to keep it simple:
---
\- go warrior if you are more interested in min/maxing your tanking ability, mitigation and aim to be a raid main tank
---
\- go druid if you are willing to give up some tanking tools in favor of greater utility outside of pure tanking (heals, innervate, combat res, stealth to name the most important)
---
FYI the quest for a soul shard bag is also the felhunter quest. Or the succubus quest. Or both. 
---
I don’t think warlock will be under represented, but I do think warrior mages and rogues will be over represented. Druids will be under represented. Druid is good and offers every group a lot of utility and support - even in pvp. But they will still be the least played of any class.
---
Lol no they won’t. There will be plenty of people to fill guild rosters.

It’s the same reason why the EU players were up in arms about Russians. Sometimes certain cultures just clash and can’t get along. NA and SA are those cultures.
---
The biggest streamers said they will come back with a decision on Sunday/Monday. Chill the fuck out
---
Glad to help :)
---
Yeah, open more realms
---

I love horde so much but all my friends are going ally so I’m rolling a dwarf hunter. I’m just looking forward to leveling with my friends again.
---
Damn, all these low level explorers. I would imagine NE to be the go to race with their OP whispers racial.
---
Just saw!!!
---
RIP my evening.
---
Also true
---
Then why say turn them on? Cause they are always on. It’s a base system in the game. Not something that needs to be turned on.
---
Blizzard is giving the top streamers their names, they don’t have to reserve them.
---
Something like this?
---
https://willitclassic.com/view/smJSzxaQLjPKavn418l1
---
I feel like streamers will be a huge thing to deal with in classic since it was like that before. Guess the only way to avoid that is a different server than them because it really doesn't sound like fun playing with them
---
Where is the data?
---
I run an i9 32gb 560pro MacBook Pro 15, with an EGPU and its run legit awesome
---
kick them?
---
I have no idea what you're talking about. Here's the [main synopsis](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?p=21502#p21502) from our perspective. Yesterday we only got wiped by 2-3 raids coming in from who knows what layers.
---
Pro tip for shamans in particular: there are 25 totems in the game. You probably only need about ten of those while leveling. The resistance totems in particular are a bit of a luxury and aren't totally necessary until raiding.
---
They're a meme spec tbh lol
---
There are thousands of people who stream everyday and no one cares about still.
---
Tbh, smack their phones out of their hand. 
---
&gt;Oops, should have been watching were you were walking, maybe you won't drop your phone when you bump into people.
---
Kind of nervous that my guild is rolling on Thalnos
---
Yeah, Dr. Disrespect is totally the same person he is IRL on stream.
---
They said layering will be out by phase 2. If it isn't, I can forsee a mass exodus back to other servers.
---
This is also how Bliz went about killing the Starcraft esports scene.
---
I agree with what he said at the end.  Good video.
---
I plan on going to Faerlina..
---
I’m literally going insane from how many times you literally said literally in your response.
---
Reserve your name on both servers, you still have two weeks until launch. If you can’t plan in that amount of time you shouldn’t be a guild leader anyway.
---
It won’t be 100% until it happens, all we know is what they say they are doing. You saying it will be after name creation is just speculation, you actually have no idea. There are rumors that name reservation is already open for streamers so it may not be necessary for them to wait at all, 
---
Stop crying saying it’s unfair, that it screws everyone over, stop all that bullshit. Just wait. Dozens of guilds are doing the same thing and they are probably more hardcore than you are anyway, so it’ll be fine.
---
I really considering instead of doing a normal alt, just level a rogue on NA streamer realm to stream snipe. Those people are delusional and need to be put back into their place.
---
except for warlock, as a gnome i had to go to Elwynn forest for voidwalker quest (if that counts)
---
Exactly, if you dont have a proven set of players verified to hit 60 in 5 or 6 days played and haven't done mc drills you have 0 chance.
---
Someone make a subreddit to organize this.
---
you're right, it really starts after 7.5 min, edited the link above
---
And you Sir, are better off playing BFA
---
One of the best!
---
I also like priest. Was my introduction to BIG.
---
What a fucking loser
---
The biggest innovative combat mechanic in Wildstar was the telegraphed attacks.  Pretty much every attack by a monster put a telegraph on the ground that showed where impacted.  And that made fights easier because people knew to stay out of it, and learned the mechanics faster.  Because of that, the designers could go whole ham on the boss difficulty, basically turning the floor into a disco party of safe locations.
---
Please no, I don't want to set up unit frames again.
---
DWARF 4 LIFE🍻
---
What? You aren't letting your character swing. That isn't a bug.
---
No. This is a community problem. Not Blizzard's problem.
---
This is going to sound like a joke, but it's not. 
---
Brazilians are so bad at the game that they can't stand to play with each other. They literally **have** to be carried. 
---
You see it in tons of games. I have no idea why, but even if there was a specific South American realm, most of them would avoid it in order to avoid other Brazilians.
---
They're usually a bit spergy, almost always nice, and absolutely hate other Brazilians.
---
The internet is fucking weird.
---
Look at the title of the topic.
---
1: While it is nice that they are wanting create a positive reputation for Brazilian guilds and players, it is unrealistic to require anyone to not communicate in their own language online. We all pay a sub, interact (respecfully) in a way you are comfortable.
---
2: Autismo, lmao
---
Queues? Please tell me you are in the wrong subreddit and we will not have dungeon finder in classic.
---
Forget min maxers, they are best left to their own devices.
---
On the other hand you don't want to end up in a raid of unprepared idiots: that will end up costing you a lot more in repair bills and time wasted recovering from wipes.
---
Play your own way.
---
You're likely to be treated like shit by streamers and then get blacklisted by the server for calling them out.
---
There is no compromise they will ninja from you then sick their fanbase on you for daring to have the *audacity* to call them out. 
---
Don't give them the benefit of the doubt because they will walk all over you every single time you do.
---
From my experience from other vanilla servers, I have to disagree with you.
---
This is great hahaha
---
The Ooga Gang would be like the Robin Hood of WoW. Most people would consider them heroes and give them special treatment. The blacklist means jack shit for them.
---
Gotta keep in mind their server capacity in 15 years has gone up tremendously
---
[my perspective](https://youtu.be/epbqPWv0f4E)
---
He has no idea how bad it can be with streamers.
---
Well this singlehandedly destroys any pro layering argument. Taking bets on how many fucks Blizzard gives.
---
I used to have a character names Ambalreth. But just to fuck with people I switched to Æmbalreth, I do not even have that letter on my own keyboard because I'm not from Denmark.
---
&gt; Which they clearly don't do as evidenced by this video in the thread you're commenting on...
---
Thats the whole point. I'm actually pointing out what should be done and how it has nothing to do with server numbers.
---
Let me introduce you to Forsen
---
It's all up to the guild leader, you could whisper them asking for their thoughts.
---
Which is why they only made 11ish servers for classic wow, to avoid the empty server issue.
---
Arugal (the only pvp oce server) is going to be packed to the brim but they want to avoid in 6 months time it being an empty server.
---
If you're a group without a tank, you aren't LFM, you're still LFG.
---
I haven’t played WoW or any MMO since like 2011. Still think that?
---
Isn’t the point of this subreddit to share experiences of classic wow??
---
Would be hilarious haha.
---
What do you mean by min maxers?  What do they do or what do they not do?
---
He's an influencer though so he's basically all but immune from most things.
---
Influencers are fucking tumors.
---
That was a YIKES from me :D
---
Quin69 is from New Zealand, hahaha
---
Imagine thinking Soda is the reason classic wow exists..... Not the hundreds of thousands of players that petitioned and Mark Kern who advocated it.... yikes.
---
Inb4 40 people gank streamers and make their own guild. How does he think something like that would work?
---
I agree tips is top level trash, but what mechanics was he wrong about. I try not to invest too much of his garbage content.
---
&gt; If they can't ever get rid of it, then I'll just quit.
---
**They literally can not.**
---
Seriously, it's not going away. This isn't a philosophical thing, it's a technical one. I work in Data -- science, management, architechting, server management, etc. They fundamentally changed how their servers work when sharding came. I'll explain:
---
When Classic came out and for the first expacs, a server was stored on...a server. A computer. There was a physical computer (called a 'blade') that stored all the database information for that server. That's all video games ultimately are, giant databases. NPC #4920 has these attributes, when you click on him, pull a query from the database to pull up Text Response #4 and Quest Text #3. These servers could hold a set amount of people, hence the queues, and had a set performance. This has a notable downside: Server quality relies on that physical server, all the data being in a single place makes it take a while to query (the bigger the database, the longer to query), and if the computer goes down so does everything else. Even worse, when updates come, you gotta update the entire blade and restart (hence weekly patch resets on Tuesday that took all day).
---
These downsides are considerable for a multi-billion dollar business, and like most industries, they moved to the Cloud and used sharding. Sharding is more than just WoW, it's a technical term for databases in Data Architechting. Sharding is a solution to this. In short, sharding...shards a database among multiple servers. It makes the databases considerably smaller and easier to query. Why would you do this? Well if you had physical servers it makes no sense really because it means you got to own a shit ton of computers. However if you pay for a Cloud based storage system like Amazon AWS or Microsoft Azure or any of the other million options, and you leverage that with some of your own spread out servers for necessities, well shit. Now you got increased server performance, you can update individual shards dynamically without a downtime (remember how BfA launched with no downtime or even needing to reboot?), and if the population grows too big? Just pull in more servers on the cloud and replicate the shard, and then delete them later when it cools down. 
---
This makes a lot of sense and increases performance considerably. Every company does this now for their data. The downside is obvious though -- mainly, when you're creating and deleting shards like mad, you got no backups. Remember how Classic almost wasn't a thing because of that? These are no longer physical blades that hold the servers anymore. These are not physical machines that hold the data. *Those do not exist anymore and never will for Blizzard.* They are simply too costly and too unreliable. The entire server structure, the entire ecosystem for their data, now lives on the Cloud and there is no changing that back. They *have* to use Shards, no matter how they call them, because that's the only way for their data to live. So you will never get your servers of old, and Layering is never going away.
---
When this guy first popped up on private servers a couple of years back he seemed like an alright dude, but it became obvious that he was a liar because he couldn't keep his own story straight for 5 minutes. The videos he'd post to his channel talking about 'the good old vanilla days, like how back in 04-06 he'd drive past Blizzard's offices on his way to work every day, saying he always dreamt about working there and how much he loved the game back then. And then later he slipped up and said he only started playing WoW in Cataclysm. So really he started playing WoW right around the time his company was barred for fraud.
---
Of course nobody knew about that stuff. All of that shit came out during classic beta when he committed sudoxxu in front of a live audience. Before then we just thought he was some lowlife trying to sneak his way into the spotlight. The best part about all of this is that he was the one who outed himself because nothing anybody could say about TO would have ever hurt him as badly as he hurt himself. It's easy to dismiss some anonymous commenter online who claims they've played with him when there's no real dirt on him.
---
Hats off to Tips Out, you outed yourself. Everybody knows you're a POS.
---
This is why I'm really upset with the rise of streamers just before Classic becomes a thing again.  This could be a huge pain in the ass for someone just trying to PvP, not even "stream-sniping".
---
Grobmob
---
I dont agree with this. Streamers are put in a situation where they are prone to getting sniped and flocked which can be annoying.
---
The thing however is that they put themselves in the situation. This clip is hopefully out of frustration in a guy who want to relive his nostalgic moment while having turned in to a job.
---
Enlighten me, what do you propose they do? Ban streamers? Yeah, that will work out well.
---
Wait how much is riding skill
---
I will say at first I wasn’t sure about Grob as a realm name but now I love it.

Then why would you want to play with them? And if you don't want to play with them then why is it an issue if they don't want to play with you?
---
Also, your assumptions aren't related to the discussion of a blacklist.
---
&gt; BRs say no NORTHAMERICANS on THALNOS
---
No, they're quite adamant for the opposite. Many Brazilian guilds have taken pledges to only speak English in public channels.
---
willitclassic.com has WA2 and BasicMinimap down as working. Has anyone had luck with these two addons? WeakAuras isn't loading for me at all and BasicMinimap is all kinds of buggy, honestly I'd take any clean square minimap addon.
---
IT WAS ONE TIME IN LEGION :'( &lt;/3
---
Haha - ah well. Guess I'm waiting 2 more weeks!
---
If you don't like it don't be in his guild - easy la!
---
All data on server population is circumstantial because the servers do not yet exist until character creation launches.
---
Fisting was a word you used
---
It was 40 on launch with 49 added to make it 89.
---
This is just downright pathetic. I feel sorry for you dude, really.
---
The meeting was there for about 5-10mins before I joined, but the rest of the jist is there.
---
TLDR; They said before I started recording that they will not be on either FAIRBANKS or WHITEMANE.
---
- They do not know for 100% certainty where they will play.
---
- Whichever server they DO play, may be decided on the day of release.
---
- They were limited by choice of server due to announcements from the BR/Espanol community.
---
Many people get involved in multiple social circles, guilds, bg premades, and sometimes just other friends in other guilds that have conflicting raid times.  
---
It's impractical/impossible to keep all of those groups together for a server split, even if you don't move.  
---
With that said, there is always heavy pressure to not move as well which is why server splits have historically been only marginally successful at best.
---
Cool dude I just played around with it, this'll work great!
---
Such a tool
---
Not enough servers for a classic wow release, sounds like it's the faithful recreation they said it would be.
---
expect to grind in the 30s to farm gold.
---
imagine letting a streamer live rent free in your head like this
---
&gt;us non-streamers
---
&gt;has twitch in name
---
Hmmmmm....
---
in this trying time
---
No, according to this reddit you are a Zoomer and you should not find this game entertaining. Your attention span is too short and the max level you will make it to is 10 before quitting.
---
Go back to Fortnite!
---
''Cast your essence into the fire!''
---
OPs making it sound like Blizzard did classic from the good of their hearts and not for their bottom line.
---
Also i am 99% sure that layering will be with all us all the way to level 60. Blizz just refused to release more servers at launch.
---
The streamers not wanting to be stream sniped is exactly why people want to do it.
---
Anyone who thinks they have a chance of beating top private server players to world first classic rag is delusional. You aren't going to beat the people who have been doing this for years, it's just not gonna happen.
---
Imagine sucking off people who laugh at you
---
Wait. Did Swifty move from Florida to Texas??????
---
Sure, but it still shouldn't be. Megaservers aren't vanilla-like at all.
---
And you're basing this off of....what? When did Blizzard create an arbitrary amount of players allowed to be doing a singular activity? Hmm?
---
They arent banning people for amassing. Why you would think so is beyond me.
---
WSG likely won't be available until 2020.
---
I think a low realm count also means that the alliance vs horde ratios won't be so lopsided
---
Just you wait :)
---
The guy with the headband is go fucking annoying
---
My guess is having a bunch of white people suggesting two distinct cultures can just share a space cuz they brown is less than encouraging for them.
---
It made me hate the other cities.  Why.  Why must the mail box and the auctioneer be so far away?
---
Think Esfan is going Herod, couple hints on his twitter the last hour or so.
---
Imo they should be banned for "blacklisting" anyone, if it can be proved well enough to a GM that they have.
---
It's basically commissioned griefing.
---
fuck wands on mage imo
---
I bet he feels awesome living rent free in this many people's heads.
---
Read this in Esfand's voice
---
I hope all the streamers roll on Herod to spite them just for the explosion of drama it would definitely cause. Shit what am I talking about. No matter what happens there’s going to be drama.
---
Yup correct, this is not a bug and how spells worked in vanilla.
---
For example, as a shaman the reason you didn't weave lighting bolt between auto was bc of this exact thing. Also with shocks, you'd only use them right after an auto to minimize dps loss in vanilla.
---
Yet I'm sure they'll want to participate in world pvp when they feel like it, though.
---
I applaud them for trying, but I played enough League of Legends before the Brazilian server existed to know that I want no fucking part of that shit show. Im sure that there are plenty of great BR players out there, but in my gaming history I have only played with a handful of noticeably good, obvious BR players... but tons of horrendous ones. Language barrier, ping issues, and then a general troll/flaming demeanor from many of the players in my experience. GL Thalnos, and fuck you blizzard for not having any dedicated LA/SA servers, you dumb fucking twats. I hope that server works out well and the BR players can turn their image around, but I feel like that's going to be harder to achieve than peace in the middle east.
---
the streamers probably won't tell you which server they are on until after they get their names too.
---
Because this sub is filled with bitter 35 year olds who are mad that they won't have the time to play this game like they did 15 years ago. Burdened by uninspiring and unexceptional lives, they're insecure about the idea that there are people younger than them who "dIdNt eVeN pLaY vAnIlLa" getting to outperform and pass them in something they thought they had some moral right to just because they were the heart of the game all those years ago.
---
It's a textbook case of "old man yells at cloud".
---
Well then don't be an idiot or do something to grief your own faction. I can't see how this is any different from any other blacklist.
---
&gt; The game hasn't become less fun in the last 15 years
---
This is true, but a lot of modern games are designed to make that fun more accessible. 
---
If a player sits down and plays Fornite for 15 minutes every day they can probably get through 1 game each time and have some fun, but if you play classic wow for 15 minutes every day you'll probably never feel like you're making any progress. Both are perfectly valid, classic wow appeals to the player that wants to put more work into their entertainment because they get a sense of accomplishment from it, but some players would rather just zone out and play a quick match of Overwatch and classic may be less appealing to some of them.
---
TLDR: Lots of modern games are built around instant gratification, classic wow is not.
---
Another streamer is an entitled child. What else is new?
---
Not in classic
---
Yep. Most reddit mods (like r/games) fucking suck dick and delete shit they don't feel like moderating. They're lazy sons of bitches sometimes and have extreme bias. It's very frustrating.
---
at twenty to eight in the FUCKIN mornin
---
The Spanish speaking community is even worse.
---
Ragnaros is the most notorious server in the game.
---
I think instant casts on pallies would not reset the swing timer but that was a special thing for their ret spec.
---
FUCK YEE CUNTS GET IT IN YAAA
---
I don't even want to imagine what they would look like if they got a management position somewhere in real life. Jesus
---
Yeah but we like the game and don't want to "not play it" to stick it to em. 
---
Doesn't mean things can't be improved upon. You're logic seems to be "play it or don't". If you can do that props but alot of us are really excited for this.
---
 If you can drop the thought classic wow in a heart beat because of a small feature you don't like. The game probably wasn't your cup of tea to begin with.
---
uss bainbridge
---
Is that top left action bar an addon?
---
LOL this shit killed me
---
Lol yeah i know. It was a joke on the fact that I get like 2 viewers
---
and they said classic is easy
---
Says who?   The internet police?
---
This game is going to bring the fucking popcorn.
---
Unless you are a hardcore PVP expert those pings will be fine, so just chose whatever server is best for you socially
---
Holy sit that is a lot of wrong.
---
I don’t understand this belief. I was a tourist back in Vanilla and got hooked. Are we under the impression that these tourists won’t get hooked with a game that HAD FUCKING ARTICLES written about it because it was so addicting.
---
It’s an old game and maybe it shows its age, but even if we retain 5% of these tourists, we could be looking at 200k+ people.
---
I'm friends with 2 great BR players and I can tell you that they hate the general BR population even more than we do.
---
As a west coaster I am happy this is somehow all contained to the east.
---
Yup, the devs have even talked about how they had to create the pally seals/judgements from scratch.
---
I think people get too hung up on this name thing.
---
 **What's in a** ***name*****? that which we call a** ***rose*****. By** ***any other name would smell as sweet***
---
Taking loot from a few people is not nearly as toxic as a streamer threatening to have an entire server blacklist a player that ganks him.
---
Tl;dr; you're wrong
---
You guys are doing God's work
---
There will be loads of warriors but GOOD warriors are always desired.
---
If you always show up for raids in time and bring consumables you will be ahead of 90% of the competition.
---
There's something else going on here than just casting a spell. As long as you cast a single spell and it's not perfectly timed to hit just before your swing animation it won't affect the swing timer at all. Go test doing single instant casts after or before the animation and you'll see it won't have any negative effect.
---
What I think is happening here is animation priority. By casting your spell just before the swing animation would start the swing will wait for your cast animation to finish, delaying your swing for a few milliseconds. By repeatedly casting you're perpetually delaying your swing, never allowing it reset and start the timer again.
---
Awesome. Going for that.

It's 1000% not about whether or not I'm going to play. My son was just born so I probably won't be playing at all. What's important is sending a message to Blizzard-Activision that legacy content is what we want to see and that the direction that retail wow is taking is not what the game needs or what the player base wants.
---
The issue here is collateral damage from stream sniping.
---
What collateral damage is there for the streamer?
---
They are getting paid by fucking idiot donors. We arnt getting paid. Fuck it. Murder them in game.
---
in his specific case i feel like anyone joining his guild understand he is the gm and plays ret and is going to take all the shit he wants.
---
you are essentially saying yeah im fine with him taking anything he wants over anyone else.
---
not really any different than someone like asmond taking every drop he can equip over his guildies first , which will likley be 2 or 3 spec's of various warrior gear
---
i like them both and im happy they will be making popular content for classic but would i be in either of their guilds? no
---
Thats some good and spicy OC
---
streamers designated they are going to play on this server tho for west coast pvp
---
what wrong with it lmao, im playingg on this server but this is dumb
---
People like to take this out of context.  He is talking about those that want to stalk and camp you day in day out.  You are not going to be put on some blacklist for ganking Soda a couple times in good fun, even if you did streamsnipe for 1 or 2 ganks which is pretty shameful.  But if you are the type of person to sit there with his stream open chasing him around daily, you probably deserve to be shunned.

We are taking the server

---
It *might* not fly on an RP realm though. Blizzard has a history of killing names from their own NPCs on those servers after player reports.
---
Asmongold is kind of a shitbag all the time. People like him because he's "real" (I disagree. I think he's just edgy, but that's just my opinion) but he's a real shitbag like 100% of the time. He just constantly mocks and insults his viewers and then mentions twitch prime and gets showered. I just don't understand it.
---
&gt; and it would make a rewrite of epic proportions to centralize it all back again, 
---
This is layering.  The thing you incorrectly call sharding.
---
I think I wanded more on my priest than I did my mage.
---
Hence sharding, unfortunately. 
---
I guess MMOs will never be the same.
---
Esfand has a very good personality, for an entertainer.  However, I've heard stories of him in private servers of him being rather greedy in his guilds.
---
I mean, if everyone in this thread hates it, there's nothing he can do about everyone here ganking and camping him. What's he gonna do? Blacklist everyone? Dude just go play a fuckin private server with your butt buddies and leave the real game to people who actually want to enjoy it.
---
I am neutral on streamers for the most part. I do plan on rolling on a server that is as streamer free as possible but not because I hate them or think they should be banned... but because they will objectively effect the server in some "unnatural ways".
---
Esfand definitely stands out as a pretty chill guy. I even like Asmon because his humor is pretty close to mine.
---
I just don't want to play on the same server as them. No ill will toward what they do, simply personal preference.
---
&gt; Flip a switch, Layering gets turned off
---
Thank you for contributing but programming and database querying is not now or ever will be as simple as "flip a switch." 
---
If you want to believe they'll put a huge burden of effort to restructure their databases for Classic to allow single set servers with no stress sharding, you are free to do so! That is a view you are free to have. However as it stands, sharding doesn't seem to be going anywhere. It will always be there. Even if they collapse everything down into a single layer, as soon as the stress comes up, they'll split them right back up again.
---
There is an "in-dev" version on Git but yea, not officially launched so all bugs are fair game.
---
I don't think layering will ever, ever be removed either. Their entire server database relies on it. I don't think they even have servers anymore that are consistent like the old ones.
---
&gt; Do you want toxic fucks
---
Whoa there, have more respect. I'm one of those toxic fucks, I mean, BRs.
---
To be fair, Esfand was just on the rise when he played private servers. Idk if he still played them after he got banned from YouTube, though.
---
I'll be fine with them opening some new servers and allowing free transfers, otherwise nah.
---
FUCK THIS ASSHOLE. ENTITLED SHIT.
---
what a fucking loser
---
What a terrible comeback.  The guy just answered your retrain cost issue and you just go back to this simpleton response.
---
The guy is a irl scammer anyways.
---
I mean Blizzard doesn't publish numbers about their games anymore (except total sold...lul) so we'll never know unless it feels like there's fewer people in cities and shit. They're deathly afraid of people finding out about their real sub numbers
---
But I'd guess with the layering shit and all the other problems it will die off within a few months. I'd love if there were an objective way to find this.
---
Lol...I supported y’all. 
---
Also, Blizzard has the understanding that Russians would get their own server because the EU and Russia don’t mix. But for some reason they forgot that SA and NA don’t mix either.
---
Every step of the way I think Blizzard is not ready for release.
---
&gt; This is layering. The thing you incorrectly call sharding.
---
They are literally the exact same thing, rebranded. Per zone, per continent, per world, it is fundamentally the same thing from a database side of things. All that's different is the scale, but it is the exact same thing. "Layers" are Data Shards, and run the exact same way on the backend that shards on BfA do.
---
Like, this isn't an argument. This is literally how it is. Sharding a zone, sharding a continent, it's still fundamentally data sharding.
---
Isn't it against TOS to not RP on an RP server?
---
Here's the thing though. Everyone knows the limitations of the healing classes when they do a role other than healing in classic. That \*\*\*\* is out there for everyone to read. If you still decide "Well, I don't care" then don't throw a tizzy when you're not looked at as a desirable choice if you respond to looking for group requests and aren't invited. 
---
If you want to play a healing class in a role other than healing then make sure you have buddies who you can party with.
---
This x 1000000000.
---
Just keep combining servers to keep them full. It's not horrible to the community to merge two communities together, especially if one community is basically dead anyway.
---
Who are those APES I keep hearing about?
---
Longer answer: Yeeessssssssssss
---
What's that thing where you feel embarrassed for someone else? That pretty pink hair girl who doesn't know how sap works and drowned herself. None of her viewers apparently knew either.
---
what part of hardcore guild do you not know of? Darn wrath babies
---
Pretty obvious when you see them riding a giant bug.
---
Me see much words me no read
---
- All the Blizzard Good Boy posters
---
Are you talking about [DejaCharacterStats](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/dejacharacterstats)?
---
This is seriously fantastic! In use now. Thanks so much!
---
One suggestion:
---
You might try a version of the Alliance one where the hammer at the top is 2D and viewed square on directly from the side rather than 3D. 
---
It will help it look more like a “crest” than a “monument” 
---
All the same, really great work.  I love all the little thematic touches like the gears and the complementary hippogryph and gryphon.
---
Never said that. But if you’re targeting them by watching their stream, isn’t that considered griefing which is reportable?
---
Greedy with garbage dps as ret
---
Usually what happens to the non "cutting edge" guilds is that there is a stable core of like 10-20 people that always show up and bring consumables, fully enchanted gear etc, 10 people that are there most of the time but still perform well and like 5-10 people that are deadweight.
---
MC and BWL is pretty easy but once you progress into AQ you need the 10 good guys that's not totally reliable to attend more often and for the deadweight to actually step up or get out. This is not that easy. Core members and officers get fed up and leave for better guilds or quit playing while being replaced by even more deadweight.
---
Thank you for making me laugh on this fine morning :)
---
What? Again, you've no fucking idea what you're talking about. You think every single time a player switches Layers the database restructures? No. All the players on the realm are stored in one database with a flag that lists their current Layer. Upon Phase 2, all those flags will simply switch to "1".
---
Both are good enough ms to not have an impact with allt he batching and leeway. So choice is more what kind of "people" you want to play with.
---
Lmao
---
Plus all the private server guilds who have that shit memorized by now.
---
You're pretty far off base man. I work in IT and have for 15 years. I'm more of a jack of all trades rather than focusing on one (databases for instance),  but even I'm aware that this isn't at all how it works. For starters, you can absolutely backup shards. Backups are the single most widely accepted best practice. No resistable IS or IT team would uprated without multiple backups.
---
xaxaxaxaxaxaxa
---
After much deliberation, I have decided that you are banned from Pagle and it will be the Official Horde PvE Server.
---
This leaves us at an impasse.
---
I can see layering being the only thing that ruins Classic initially. Hopefully we wont have to endure it for long.
---
Why does it matter if horde rolls Pagle? It's a PvE server.
---
His whole thing is “Ret Prio” I would think it’s a prerequisite for joining his guild that he’s gonna take bis stuff
---
Also very few people are willing to/can commit to a membership fee over here.
---
I feel you. I'm BR and I used to avoid other BRs like the plague. with time I learned to only deal with the few I know and ignore the rest lol
---
i doubt that pixel walking will be as much of a thing as it used to. They probably made models smoother and less sharp than they were back then.
---
So a whiny streamer is trying to take on the trolls? Hahahaha, good luck kid.
---
“Blizzard knows what they are doing.”
---
If you say this yourself, shut the fuck up. It’s clear that Blizzard has lost connection with their community and fucking common sense is out the window.
---
Russians got their own servers, why would they think NA and SA would be any different?
---
5 FUCKING PVP SERVERS! 5!!!!! Layering is going to be around for the long haul, boys.
---
Or dives
---
This.
---
If the guild has 40 consistent min/maxers and have all role's filled then u won't be invited to raid unless your a herb slave for the guild with a off spec. That's the extreme case but in reality if your guild is small they will be begging you to come to raid because getting 40 people with different schedules organized is harder then content most of the time. One thing though a guild with like 20 meme specs are not doing AQ 40 and Naxx. All the other content is ease just be all at attention during vael and Nef.
---
Unfortunately wall walking and wall jumping are both patched out of the Classic client. I saw one video of a guy doing it on this client, but it was with absolute perfect precision. Way more difficult than back in the day.
---
I was a huge explorer back in the day. Wall jumping let you zone into instances like ZG and ZF, get outside of their walls without touching the portal, and  explore massive zones with flat, jagged terrain that sometimes had remnants of buildings and caves and such.
---
I'm hopeful exploration like this will still be possible, maybe a lot more difficult and relying more on blink/charge, but we'll still see some sick Noggaholic type videos I'm sure.
---
The won't remove it.
---
im sure it wont too, but one can dream! your right though, with so few servers blizz seems to be setting themselves up for problems
---
There is no bug reporter on the Stress Test
---
Layering is only for the first few weeks of release, if I'm not mistaken.
---
OK content haha
---
he has a 3 min video and drags it out to 10 min
---
Hi! I've RPd heavily in multiple MMOs including WoW since 2004. Most RPers are thrilled to meet new RP friends and will be very tolerant of mistakes, especially if you tell them that you're new. You will run into jerks, but just remember they are the exception not the rule. If you do make a mistake, most people will just politely ignore it and move on.
---
 Others have answered your questions already so I won't go over those too much, but I did want to point out a few common newbie RP mistakes. 
---
Make sure that your character's backstory doesn't break the established lore. Again, most people will forgive some mistakes, just try your best!
---
Don't make a character that is too powerful or who is related to any existing NPCs. A lot of people will be annoyed by this.
---
Try to keep what you know and what your character knows separate. For example, guild tags are OOC information, so your character won't know which guild someone is associated with unless they tell you IC. This can be hard to keep up with but again, just do your best and most people will quickly forgive any slip ups. 
---
That's about it. Don't worry too much, I've made hundreds of stupid obvious mistakes in my years and was only very rarely ever chastised for it. Feel free to ask if you have any more questions, hope to RP with you on Bloodsail Buccaneers in a couple weeks!
---
Yes! But they're also not lowballing. They're doing exactly what they should be doing to ensure every realm has the maximum sustainable population for as many Phases as possible. As they get numbers from Classic's launch, they'll make new realms as needed.
---
It'd be rad if blizzard had just one server of each type where no content creation of any variety was allowed (watermark of your username in various places a-la a closed NDA beta or etc. for enforcement) so that those of us who have no interest in playing with any variety of content creator at all could just enjoy themselves. Too bad those guys generate too much revenue.
---
I would feel sorry but then again, I reminisce all the memories, when i got killed by a hunter poking me from 70yards using aspect of cheetah in open world... It kinda makes me feel that there is a justice in this world after all
---
yeah im pretty sure this same clip was posted like a month or so ago and people were like 'who cares' 'let him' etc. and now everyones acting all outraged lmfao.
---
Yes its available till Monday 9:00 am PST. Its worth it considering on Monday you will be able to get your character name and realm too.
---
Monday morning at 9am PST I believe
---
Stress test ends on Monday, not sure what time however
---
9am PDT happens when this comment is 9 hours and 48 minutes old.
---
You can find the live countdown here: https://countle.com/Q4NAEzYFc

Chuck Norris Anal ...
---
n-nani..?
---
Thank god you left the part out where they woke her up.  That would have ruined it for her. 
---
Also, dont give me the shot haha.
---
Great thank you! I wanted to play it today + save the name beforehand, so yes i think its worth doing it.
---
If Classic dies because of layering or they don't fix their realm issue, I could easily see tons of people moving back to pservers. There's also a greater incentive to go back to vanilla pservers because they can improve pservers from Classic.
---
I think many guilds (including mine) are still deciding/announcing a server.
---
Check the Classic WoW Guilds discord if you want find more guilds.
---
To my knowledge the tos for rp servers hasn't been released yet. So no idea till they do.
---
modern wow is whack a mole
---
I remember WoW getting very slightly worse with TBC and I mostly stopped playing. I played WOTLK for a bit and had some fun, but quit after very easily leveling and gearing my guys. 
---
After a few years, I decithr to play WOD, and holy s**t was it bad I had zero fun, it wasn't the game I remembered at all. I literally thought that my previous taste in games was bad and that vanilla was probably boring as well. Then I played on a private server. 
---
Vanilla was a superior game! It had more depth and more challenge. I stopped playing around level 40 because I didn't want to just get my character deleted when the private server was ultimately shut down.
---
The whole experience made me angry. Classic WoW is one of the best games ever made. It isn't for everyone, but it is absurdly fun and rewarding, the world is interesting and it blows my mind how much better it was than its contemporaries in 2004-2006. The denial by what seemed like very incompetent Blizzard employees denying that a vanilla server would be used. I also found that most/all of the original dev team was gone.
---
The on thing is, Blizzard cannot suck people's money forever with just classic WoW, eventually, people will have their fill. It's not because the game isn't great, it has hundreds and hundreds of hours of immersive, excellent social RPG gameplay. The issue is that everything comes to an end, people will move on. Classic almost has to be a secondary product, because of its static nature. 
---
I can guarantee you though even after I get bored with Classic I will come back and roll another character or level an alt up.
---
No, they could shard the data 1000 times and still only have 10 Layers. Or only shard it 10 times and have 1000 Layers. Layering is an in-game technique to maximize a server population without causing a negative play experience. It has NOTHING to do with the backend.
---
&gt; fuckhead
---
You said it, not me.
---
Then don't roll hunter?
---
I'm gonna roll hunter because I think it's fun, personally. I don't always have to play the best class in a game to have fun. I actually enjoy trying to overcome adversity.
---
Clearly waiting it out is the smart decision. WHEN these servers are inevitably full and just overall cancer, you can roll on one of the new ones that popped up.
---
Since you mention it, SJWs should find a common server too, so we can stay away from it.
---
I bet if a post showing undeniable proof of fuckery gets enough traction, Blizzard's hand would be forced.
---
But do you have a flag?
---
No flag no server.
---
It deserves no respect, because they didn't d it on their own.  They will be cheating to do it.  Back in the day, how you won mattered as much as winning.  
---
I would get no sense of accomplishment from doing this.   I will settle for my week 2 clear that I actually earned.
---
There are several online games that have done it. The thing is the normal brazilian players also speak english so you don't notice them and don't get to make your dumbass comments about stereotypes.
---
Doing the same thing
---
That's fine I'm Australian, we don't get RP realms anyway.
---
Just sayin, if it ruins your fun that someone else might have clientside updated graphics, get a life.
---
\&gt;all of those shills
---
Those accounts will suddenly dissipate after a few weeks when Classic releases
---
Kinda don't want to be stuck with a shitty name if im gonna spends hundreds of hours on it
---
And what about the 38 other people in the raid you fuck over just to stick it to a streamer ?
---
Yeah, could the MAGA delegation and the streamers just come together and sequester themselves to one server? That would be great.
---
Everyone knows Dwarf Paladin is best. I will be a Cube of Righteous fury and Holiness
---
Lol qq more, hunter is still a top solo leveling class with insane utility and if u play it right still op
---
They're on record stating layering would only be used for the first 2-4 weeks after launch until the servers stabilize. It definitely can not be used after phase 2 because it wouldn't work at all with world bosses, so that's a hard limiter on how long the tech will be utilized. You can be pessimistic but I don't think they would blatantly lie about it - if they intended to use the technology for longer then they simply wouldn't comment about people's concerns with it. Instead they made a point to lay out a timeline for its use, so I'm inclined to trust them. There's also tons of videos of it bugging out and splitting up layers for people in the same party, so it isn't even working properly for its limited release. I definitely don't think it will be used for long.
---
Luckily i'm EU and won't have to deal with that
---
Thalnos might be the least populated PvP server if everyone avoids it like the plague.
---
Yikes lmao
---
Just tell your right hand that your left hand is just a friend and nothing more.
---
Um, yep, that’s what addons are!
---
Why is that?  Plenty of EU streamers streaming other crap aren't they?
---
"We want to avoid streamers because they'll ruin the server, so let's go ruin the RP-PVP server with non-RPers since we can't have nice things."
---
&gt; Its worth it considering on Monday you will be able to get your character name and realm too.
---
What? Can you elaborate?
---
This ironically makes me want to gank streamers even more. I don’t even do it. But I want to now. Fuck people who think they’re entitled to things just because they have an audience.
---
Thank you for the pics. Seems like daytime can make a huge difference and my pics are from morning or evening? Really interesting since yours look way closer to vanilla in terms of colors
---
i start my rotation with immolate so i just made a macro to make my pet attack when i cast that
---
/petattack
---
/cast Immolate
---
'Cause I'm lookin' at the rest of you servers, and this is the guy in the server list doing all the fishing, am I right?
---
“So bad that it’s good!”
---
My main was a hunter back in the day (I stopped playing in TBC) and I can't imagine playing any other class. Sure there may be times when its extra challenging to take on other players but thats the fun of the game. Even though it seems that odds are against you, you will have to find ways to adapt and overcome. 
---
The biggest challenge will be duels as you are restricted in that small radius but world pvp/BGs is a different story! Get the jump on people, use your tools to keep distance and be a nightmare!
---
I highly doubt that
---
It depends on your skill level (vanilla is all about predictive healing, not reactive healing), your gear, your adding, and your guild. It also depends on the phase. For instance, paladins scale way better (at least on p servers) in BWL gear than any other healer. Druids scale alright with gear but have a higher skill cap. Since their hots overwrite each other, usually only 2 Druids are brought to raids. I’ve seen Druids top the meters in AQ and Naxx, but those guys are monsters. You can definitely develop the skill required
---
This is our first home. We've been couch surfing on American and Russian servers for 15 years
---
Well, it's certainly not "cool". Once you have demanded other people sacrifice their loot for a common goal and then you show yourself completely unwilling to make the same sacrifices? I would argue that you have a debt. And failing to pay that debt is definitely not cool. 
---
As for what that makes him... Well, I would say it reflects on his leadership at the time, his assertiveness and ability to advocate for people who were relying on him (at the time), and his sense of fair play and moral character (at the time.). 
---
Those all, in my book, definitely go to if someone is a good person or a bad person. And certainly a cool person. 
---
But of course, people change and if we judged everyone by their worst moment, we would all look like monsters. I just remember thinking as I watched the youtube.... "this is YOUR version of events? and you are okay with this and feel proud of this accomplishment?" 
---
I guess.... points for honesty?
---
&gt; Layering is an in-game technique to maximize a server population without causing a negative play experience. It has NOTHING to do with the backend.
---
TIL Server performance has nothing to do with the backend!
---
I'll spell this for you. That ingame technique...which moves people onto different layers...so that their data is fundamentally easier to query...leading to faster performance and lower queues...is called...*data sharding.* Which is on the backend.
---
It's readily apparent you have literally zero experience with software development in general, let alone any form of data management. Which is fine, but when someone boldface claims server performance has nothing to do with backend with this level of insistence, it makes a conversation impossible.
---
I dont mind this, if a person is desperate enough for attention to actually streamsnipe all the time then why wouldnt streamers have repurcussions, if youre afraid to get blacklisted by just simply killing him then dont play on his server,
---
Believe it or not we are all free to make our choices, and we all have to face consecvenses, 
---
soda is usually ok when it comes to simple ganks when he was playing in the beta, even when he died in 1v1s he didnt mind, it was only when he was stealthed in a really far off spot where and a mage "randomly aoed" in that exact spot and obviusly killed him when he was afk that he called it streamsniping.
---
They chose to join a guild led by a guy that steals from taxpayers and plays the "you're a racist" card whenever he doesn't get his way. In other words, they deserve it.
---
Can you play PvE and turn flagging on?
---
New realms are dead on arrival. People are already creating communities before the game has even launched. They won’t move after launch.
---
Two PvP servers on EU is not enough. One will be dominated by streamers. If we’re lucky APES will take the same realm, otherwise, if they take the other, EU PvP realms will be unplayable. Then there’s the language issue with eastern europeans, spaniards, italians. Good luck if you unknowingly roll on a dedicated Spanish realm.
---
would it be good idea to make a alt down the road with herb/alchemy im starting on a warrior with skinning/mining after making good amount of gold ill switch it to eng/mining just worried if my alt not that geard ill have a problem with people trying to kill me as i herb
---
Your &lt; and &gt; signs are the wrong way around
---
They can literally spin up more servers minutes after launch if they want and need to
---
My guild narrowed it down to Whitemane and Fairbanks and we figured more Alliance would be on Whitemane so we went with the spooky boi/Alaskan city. I feel like the overall pop will be similar on both tbh. 
---
Those thighs though.
---
Most big wow streamers are NA, and the smaller EU ones wont cause any trouble or will play NA as well
---
TLDR?
---
The number of realms is a pretty clear indicator.
---
Hunter- prepare for your IQ to decrease substantially 
---
Rogue- prepare to die to warriors
---
Druid- prepare to run away, but better than anyone else
---
Because the rest of LATAM doesn’t want to play with BRs....
---
Ugh hate this fucker
---
Layering is not about server performance.
---
And kid, you know nothing about me.
---
Yeah I guess you're right. At least he seems to be treating the classic community at large alright, though from what I can tell, and that's what matters most imo. I don't have to be in his guild and raid with him.
---
I am most likely rolling a human priest. Dwarves have better priest racial, but I prefer how humans look in cloth armor!
---
What did he say to out himself?
---
its not asking you to be level 10 but the 10th level of wow hell
---
I think referring to more casual or pickup-and-play games as "hollow" is a bit of a misnomer. The idea that anyone's fun is somehow more valid than someone else's is pretentious and stupid. I'm not a fan of Fortnite or League of Legends but they are extremely popular games, which is likely due in part to the fact that they appeal to a larger, more casual audience. 
---
All that said, I'm all for classic and I tend to agree that retail is trash because there's no stakes and no investment required, but I also recognize that a significant portion of the launch player base is interested in classic because of the hype and/or nostalgia, and once that dissipates so will they.
---
I almost certain that some of the starting area gears were updated. But that’s all I know.
---
because they are disruptive, and because their bitchboys are scum?
---
It was so weird when XRoads was all empty and shit. I guess this is why
---
You guys are whiny little kids. The streamer server thing won’t be as bad as you guys want everybody to believe.
---
#GrobGang
---
Yeah I think it is phase 1. Doing what you describe though will waste fortunes as the auction house has fees. The higher the sale price the more you waste.
---
But it’s narrowed down to literally two servers, or if they’re bluffing then 3. They’re almost definitely not getting their names given the amount of trolls out there. Realistically they’ve got a 1 in 100 shot at best.
---
So if I don't give a flying fig who this guy is and just use mind vision to hunt him down is he still going to throw a hissy fit and try to get me boycotted?
---
im sure they look at the reports before they ignore them
---
they have not mentioned any improvements to layering and these sort of issues have been happening since day 1
---
If you plan to do some serious pvp then you want to raid in Horde also
---
Look, I really want what you said to be true. But I don’t see how. Without layering, the servers host, what, 120k people? And that is only if we fill them to the brim which would mean every zone is permanently packed with players, every node is permanently contested and every farm spot is permanently occupied.
---
With this amount of servers I don’t see layering going anywhere. You think they’ll launch p2 without layering if there are still tens of thousands of players logging in per realm?
---
Some angry guy in Elwynn: Are you retarded or are you just trying to piss off the connunity?
---
Me: Both
---
I'll be honest, soda being the piece of shit he is almost makes me want to roll Alliance after playing Horde for 15 years just so I can camp his dumb, entitled ass until he pitches a little bitch fit and turns his stream off.
---
I don't understand the arrogance, as if you're going to have control over *every* good player/guild on your server on both factions and can convince people to just not group with someone who camped you.  Its like hey, you stupid motherfucker, my entire guild thinks you're a piece of shit, we'll be in just as good if not better gear than you, and post raid/non raid night guild activities will be stream sniping and camping you until you want to quit the game.
---
Really put the "You think you do, but you don't" into Classic.  You think you control the server and can blacklist people at will, but you don't, and you can't, you pathetic loser.
---
This will make WPVP raids pointless.
---
I believe all na servers are in the same place. The only difference is the clock settings
---
He pisses off a large segment of the community by just existing. The people who hate him because of this server fiasco already hated him.
---
well supposedly they can handle more players, but they said they will monitor the situation at launch. If anything they will just add a bunch more realms if they need. They are completely aware that layers don't belong in the game past phase 1.
---
Looks like a pussy.
---
To be honest, the majority of people are passive while levelling on a PVP server on a fresh launch, not only that there is no honor ranks so they will be even less tempted to kill you.
---
you arent supposed to even have layering in the first fucking place it dogshit. Open more servers if beeded and have free character transfer from high pop to low pop like it used to be.
---
During the classic beta level 30 duel tournament that he hosted he accidentally showed legal documents with his full name on stream. People then googled his name and the rest is history.
---
People who have time to make posts like this and concern themselves with such meaningless issues blow my mind
---
Lol what? Maybe warriors, but Rogues will kill you in a stun especially if they're playing coldblood prep. PVP in Classic basically anything goes, that also means thistle tea, and free action potions. Hunters are still good but they require a player who knows their class very well to actually succeed in pvp.

Steamers are cancer.
---
&gt;pve server
---
I honestly think you’ll regret it. World pvp is one of the best parts of vanilla in my experience, especially as a Druid. It keeps you on your toes in contested zones, and there’s a unique satisfaction to killing a player who killed you earlier or stole your quest mob. As far as leveling Druid is the quintessential solo leveler. You can tank, heal, do decent damage, and you get a sick movement speed buff.
---
Fraud thing?
---
That’s part of the fun. Go pve don’t whine on a pvp server
---
I'm rolling a Druid and a Mage on PVP server.
---
Druid will roll skinning and mining. Going to sell ports with Magey.
---
The biggest bottleneck to success in the reboot will be money, travel speed and PVP. Druids are the most versitile class out there for leveling, until 45ish... feral druid can tank, dps, even heal most instances without issue.
---
Its not a stereotype. There's a reason people on live refuse to play with LA server folks
---
Well at that point people won't be cramming to get on the servers as much as launch, we'll see though
---
Lots of woosh going on here.
---
To be fair that dude does hit like a fucking truck. Not having experienced it before can be very jarring.
---
No amount of english will cover up how shit they are at the game
---
"DAE think [extremely popular ingame celebrity] is a cool guy?"
---
I want to play on this server, but it seems mentally draining.
---
Hey everyone, 
---
First of all, to all brazillians, this is a great step for our community, and I was really happy when I saw it. Please, let’s make it happen. I really believe that all that was written above is possible, and we can make this game a good place for everyone, from every country. 
---
Acctually, I was thinking further... I’d like to try an international guild. You guys may think, “what?”. But yeah, this could work... it would be a casual guild, we would do DGs, BGs, WPVP, RP events, even RAIDs (just call everybody on chat and let’s give it a try), but, most important... let’s connect each other, let’s have fun together, let’s play together.
---
It’s an opportunity to know people, maybe to learn a new language, to make distant friends. That’s all WoW is about, community... 
---
Well, I’ll be playing in Thalnos...
---
See you guys in Azeroth!
---
Cheers from Brazil.
---
Again, ensuring a smooth launch to meet server demands is about the in-game experience, not the backend.
---
Language barriers in general make rolling on a server in unison hard without a universal translator of some kind. Beyond just selling items and using a way to find people the community aspect of classic is so important if you can't communicate with the player base on the server it's going to be difficult with 3rd party voice chat and other organization.
---
 It's just ideal to try to roll on a server with your preferred to use fluent language unless the BR community is so small they need to share a server. This will create pockets of people in sub communities that will seldom communicate outside of their own language bubble. Anglophones will have more server, guild and premade group opportunities on a server where the majority of the audience uses English primarily. It's the same case for European Servers with German, French or Russian (granted they get their own client).
---
It's nothing personal against Portuguese speakers or any non English speaker for a primarily Americas/Western audience among us servers. I imagine it's probably bad for Qubecers who aren't fluent in english at least to a native or academic level required for pvp premades.
---
So much easier to go commando in a dress tho.
---
Thank you. Sadly, I’m going to play on the EU side, at Hydraxian Waterlords, being from Belgium myself. I hope you understand.
---
having so few servers and expecting the population to massivly drop so they can remove layering is a mistake
---
Mods need to start deleting this repetative low effort shit.
---
They're shills not apologists. Anyone that has played Vanilla would never agree that sharding/layering is a good idea. The only people that defend it are 
---
A. Shills 
---
B. Blizzard forum posters that barely play the game and have thousands of posts on their forum account, routinely trying to change the game yet they don't play it or play it very casually. This is the minority that Blizzard listens to and make game changes because of it.
---
 The true players who love and have passion for the game are swept aside, customer and Blizz employee alike.
---
Nah, in EVE the scummy assholes are clever enough you have to tip your hat.
---
Yuuuuuup
---
Korean
---
Pure projection.
---
&gt;Note: the only reason I'm not linking to proof is because the court records contain TipsOut's IRL name and even when a quick google search can produce the same results, doxxing someone on Reddit isn't cool or allowed.  
---
If its publicly available then its not doxxing.
---
He didn't say it isn't shitty of him to do, just it's probably not who he is off camera.
---
Someone tell him he's a little late to the party.
---
&gt; Again, ensuring a smooth launch to meet server demands is about the in-game experience, not the backend.
---
Dude. Holy shit lmao. 
---
Yes, it's about the in-game experience. *Which is facilitated through the backend.* Server demands *are done on the backend.* Do you really not get how something in the backend can affect someone in the in-game front-end? How are you this dense.
---
not a bug
---
Moonglade has guards that will attack anyone who recently attacked another player. The quest lines are different for horde and alliance. I recommend you pvp as a Druid because it’s insanely fun when you know what you’re doing. Druids are real wildcards, like genji in overwatch. They can be utterly trash if played poorly, they can be gods if played correctly.
---
He jumped on the hype for it early and just made a lot of youtube videos, leeching Esfands success on Classicast. Didn't realize he was such a douche until recently.
---
Thicc Thighs Save Lies ;)
---
Private servers wont be allowed to exist with Classic being a thing now Blizzard is going to be going after private servers more aggressively, and i personally dont want to play on a server being hosted out of Russia to avoid cease and desist where i'll have awful ping. I haven't seen a single pserver that didn't have bugs no matter how inconsequential they were and some just never getting fixed. Layering is just a compromise i'll take because in the end it makes more sense than having hundreds of realms with 5k population on each and then eventually people drop off and it beomes a ghost town on some realms whereas with layering that will NEVER happen as there would just be less layers and you will always see people around unless you get unlucky and get placed in the empty layer while all the others are full, but im sure they'll figure out an algorithm so that doesn't happen.

"YaLL CaNt BeHAvE" [Locked]
---
Please come check it out and if you're expecting porn you will be sorely disappointed
---
When you blacklist 90% of the server because 90% of the server hates you, all you're really doing is blacklisting yourself.
---
Something like League is definitely not an instant gratification game.  Neither is something like Overwatch, or probably fortnite.  
---
But things like Retail, most other MMO's that have released in the past 10 years, things like Destiny, etc. definitely are, at least to some extent.
---
Ok apologies. Can you explain what it is for the two of us?
---
I moreso meant for the people in the anti-streamer community, which a lot of people on this subreddit seem to be a part of.
---
I keep seeing this statement like it even slightly matters, who cares if he didn't play vanilla lol stop gatekeeping like it's some magical unicorn only the oldest of oldies know how to tame.
---
I'm done here kid. Take your wikipedia education and your tinfoil hat and go crawl under the covers with your mom. It's time for your nap. My guess is that you're a UCF gender studies kid that dropped out when Dad found out his kid was gay and refused to pay tuition any longer.
---
Sodapoppin is a douchebag and I hope he gets ganked non-stop. Blacklist me fuckboy.
---
It's the difference in resolution.  People have already done extensive tests.
---
It isn't meaningless, though. Whether a streamer plays on the server I do or not completely affects my gameplay experience, whether I play with them or not.
---
Have fun with those 50g Respecs. I hope you’re rolling a Goblin.
---
Meanwhile he will use his viewer influence to get him ahead by begging for resources/loot but make a blacklist for the disadvantages of being a streamer.
---
I'll be sure to try that out once classic goes live for real! Nothing cooler than a bunch of skydiving night elves :D
---
Hey, fellow metalheads. Let's all feel slightly old together. Here are some great albums that released the same year that World of Warcraft did:
---
* Mastodon - Leviathan
---
* Pig Destroyer - Terrifyer
---
* The Dillinger Escape Plan - Miss Machine
---
* Bloodbath - Nightmares Made Flesh
---
* Necrophagist - Epitaph
---
* Anata - Under a Stone With No Inscription
---
* Behemoth - Demigod
---
* Leviathan - Tentacles of Whorror
---
And here's some from when Drums of War was released:
---
* Celtic Frost - Monotheist
---
* Tool - 10,000 Days
---
* Mastodon - Blood Mountain
---
* Warning - Watching From a Distance
---
* Katatonia - The Great Cold Distance
---
* Peste Noire - La sanie de siecles
---
* Insomnium - Above the Weeping World
---
* Meshuggah - Nothing (Remaster)
---
* Amon Amarth - With Oden on Our Side
---
* Anata - The Conductor's Departure
---
* Gorod - Leading Vision
---
* Protest the Hero - Kezia
---
* Persefone - Core
---
Use these for period-relevant metal with a more high-class twist.
---
My problem isn't the streamers themselves, it's all the young or immature fans/griefers that will follow them around
---
What a fucking loser... Lol
---
Tbf, this actually happens on 1.12 Private servers too, but only at certain spots like right at the edge of two zones.
---
Don’t forget “11%”.
---
cant good hunters kite people to death?
---
What about them?
---
I think most are good guys. People are over exaggerating
---
You mean intellect***
---
Lucky for you you're not joining his guild? Who cares seriously lol if he wants to run his guild like a dictator let him, only betas are going to join him anyway..
---
50DKP MINUS!
---
That's just it.  You don't have to be good at the game to potentially do this.  You just need to get to 60 fast.
---
IF was also the previous ONLY AH so some people just kept their habits and others followed, even if there were other options later on.
---
I don't understand why these threads are downvoted. Sharding/Layering will have MAJOR impact on the game, so why ignore it or try and defend it mindlessly?
---
What if players just ignored the fact that there were no EU specific language servers like Germany/France? Because of all the forum posts, they added those language specific servers. I guess people don't believe Blizzard can get rid of layering before Classic releases. And how could they? There are only 2 English PVP servers in Europe!
---
The whole thing is a sad state of affairs.
---
I dont think they said that
---
... I didn't even think of this, this is a relief when you put it that way.
---
Well, they seem pretty confident in themselves: https://www.wowhead.com/news=291722/layering-in-classic-wow
---
Dives is a fuckin legend among men. Assuming we are talking about &lt;Wipe Club&gt;
---
dont worry there is a ton of people that plan to shit on him all day for the sole purpose of enjoying his despair    
---
he's gonna nope the fuck out to pve server
---
The city being close to Blackrock Mountain was also a big plus.
---
Possibly it is a mistake, but the point is that the motivation for having few servers is not cost savung. They are doing what they think is best for the game, which may or may not turn out to be correct.
---
ya no
---
No, that's not true. Revealing the IRL name of any Reddit user is against Reddit's ToS. Even doxxing yourself isn't allowed, though exceptions have been made for public figures.
---
They extended it till monday 9 pst
---
I do.
---
More servers.
---
No layering, no sharding.
---
*If* the player retention is *really that bad*, merge servers.
---
EZ Clap you're welcome.
---
They were extended until Monday.
---
&gt; I'm done here kid. Take your wikipedia education and your tinfoil hat and go crawl under the covers with your mom. It's time for your nap. My guess is that you're a UCF gender studies kid that dropped out when Dad found out his kid was gay and refused to pay tuition any longer.
---
You seem like a real treat of a person.
---
Then don't. It's that simple.
---
^ me, Ashyra
---
Some people will follow that kind of code sure but for every one that does there is going to be another who thinks that there is absolutely nothing wrong with a level 60 corpse camping a level 40 for an hour and literally not letting them play or leave the area. PVP servers naturally attract more dicks like that and so I have always found the PVP action on PVE servers more enjoyable.
---
&gt;Ion literally said layering is gone in 2 months.
---
That means absolutely nothing. He has already lied about layering being only implemented in the starting zones from levels 1-10.
---
Layering will be permanent unless they add way more servers.
---
Oh, I was out of the loop when it was on sale, but thanks for explanation.
---
All but like 8 servers on retail are ghost towns.
---
There is still time to add servers based on name reservation metrics between 13th and 27th, without screwing anyone over (mostly).
---
sopa de macaco, uma delicia....
---
only problem you will have will be food/drinks costs; from level 30 it will cost alot and if youre bad at the game, then start kissing mage asses
---
I mean its only been like that for 15 years already
---
So much pride brings a tear to my eye!
---
I find it ironic that people keep saying new servers are dead on arrival when just a few months ago when we were all talking about "what happens next" people were hoping that Blizzard would continuously roll out new servers to start the progression over and over and over.
---
Personally I don't think that's a good idea, but the idea that new servers are dead depends drastically on how successful you think Classic will be. Will new servers be super competitive hardcore etc etc ? No, but they will be great havens for casual players if we see a steady flow of new players coming in. And that's always gonna be the bulk of the player base.
---
Eh, the streamers want to play fuck fuck games and not tell people in advance so they can be avoided they're going to have the tables turned.
---
I hope any of them trying to join the server get stream sniped and camped 24/7.
---
Pretending to act retarded is still acting retarded.
---
Its exactly the same, its just higher FOV that makes you feel running faster.
---
I have to say, I really enjoyed what RichTurpin did on the beta. :)
---
Lol what a wanker!, tell this no life to get a life
---
I've noticed this sub has way more shills Blizzard than r/wow, which is kind of ridiculous.
---
Shamans don’t have more armor than a warr, ever. Plate has an inherently high armor value than mail. But yea shamans will destroy a Druid anyway for all the reasons you listed. Your one advantage over them is that they cannot keep up with you and can’t get out of your root
---
But it isn't...
---
^ Hey Txbone, I was in KE. Name was Ashyra and I was a priest
---
Code of /spit
---
&gt; This was planned all along.
---
I disagree.  Classic is due to a combination of factors coming together and Blizz taking advantage of it.
---
1) The Nostalrius shutdown and the feedback that it had on Blizz.  This is what triggered Classic on Blizzard's radar, but it wasn't enough  to make them want to pursue the project alone.
---
2) BFA was poorly received.  This was known before BFA left NDA and was a concern that was raised back in Legion from a design perspective.  Like, so much power and class fantasy was tied into the artifact weapons that they *knew* it was going to be a challenge to progress past it.  On top of that, there was little to no class advancement/rework for some classes, as well as some of the 'bad' mechanics (Titan forging, world quests, ect) showing their downsides when there is little to no good things happening in the expansion as a whole.
---
3) The large number of other games that were successful with 'remakes'.  This is what, imo, showed that Classic could be good for Blizz.  As they have lost income from a shrinking player bases in certain games, fewer new players in others, additional costs with their ESports leagues, taking a game that would need minor investment (comparatively) to boost their numbers within ActiBlizz.
---
All of these things came together to form a storm that made Classic good idea financially, as well as with the player base.  This wasn't something that insiders at Blizz planned by making BFA bad on purpose so they could justify Classic.  As others have pointed out, Classic doing well will be a major issues for Blizz executives and Retail game designers as it will show that their direction and philosophies are wrong.  While this is something this sub has said (and I agree with), Classic would give empirical evidence that this is the case and likely cause a major shift/shake up in the WoW teams / Blizz as a whole.
---
Oh man, I meant darkshore, not dusk wood, my bad.
---
i use titan panel and turn it on auto-hide, so it never gets in the way.
---
There was some dude who Facebook lived his day. He was killed in a drive by. Turns out he was in a rival gang and they saw him streaming where he was.
---
You can heal any dungeon while leveling to 60 as feral, as long as you keep some intellect gear on you
---
&gt;  Revealing the IRL name of any Reddit user is against Reddit's ToS. Even doxxing yourself isn't allowed
---
 Imagine my laughter coming into this thread and seeing you say this, [one post after you dug through my post history to doxx information about me in an internet argument.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cot2bh/layeringsharding_is_never_leaving_musings_from_a/ewl4fwm/)
---
:thinking emoji:
---
NO offense but Elder scrolls online and FFXIV being on steam and console have made them super mainstream. Consistently in the top played games.
---
Yeah that's something new I discovered today.
---
Like I and others have said before, you don't have to respec to heal for raids.
---
I would play a paladin if I didn’t have to wear a dress. I’d like to wear plate as a plate wearer.
---
Yeah man, It's all going to workout. I'm sure the top post on this sub reddit is just some anti-classic shill post, and will never happen because reasons. Blizzard will figure it out. I mean it's only 2 weeks but that's plenty of time to fix a fundamental flaw with the game they can't back out of because there's a laughable amount of servers available at launch.
---
You’re best bet is probably herbing at 60
---
"The people that put this reputation on us don't represent the bigger part" - Bulllllllshittttt. I've been forced in a server group with Azralon and I honestly, not exaggerating at all, have ever grouped with one good Brazilian Azralon player. They're all shit. Thankfully on retail there are addons to weed out the BR's and their attempt to be carried, but I don't think there will be a solution with Classic. It's just easier to avoid the server altogether. Fuck Thalnos. I'll never step foot in the same party as a Brazilian.
---
That's a shit situation.  If I were you I would roll on a PvE server.  
---
Does it work on PvE servers to hang out with flagged NPC's and gank players when they kill them?
---
So he's going the Athene route. Claim a bunch of things way out of your league and reach for some fame by standing on the backs of others and hope it works out.
---
I just hope he doesn't also start a cult like Athene did.
---
&gt;source?
---
this is fucking hilarious.
---
Yeah the one server the give is the BR claimed one.
---
...
---
That's exactly where I am. happy to watch, don't have any desire to ever play with him, ever.
---
HoTW / Natures Swiftness is a good spec.  Can tank dungeons with the right gear and still heal effectively even in raids.
---
Druid is literally the class of the week with a stickied thread to discuss it.
---
Someone must have lost their band of accuria to a druid
---
server merging sucks though
---
And I'm sure you'll still use it even on release
---
“Once the situation reaches a controlled state, it will be completely disabled“
---
The situation will never reach a controlled state on 10 servers per region.
---
You're the one that thinks Blizzard has just been straight up lying to everyone for years about removing Layering in Phase 2.
---
 [0/30/21](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/-503050130302215-05501310501)  allows you to tank and heal, without sacrificing TOO much cat dps for open world stuff.  You can easily move the talents around for a more cat-centric spec.
---
Now hope nobody rolls as Moondin the night elf
---
Ooze and Skarm have raided with him and didn't seem like they had good thoughts about it.  He probably seems the most "I want to have fun" though out of the rest of the more popular streamers.  Sure, he's pulling meme status being a guild leader as a Ret Paladin, but hey, more power to him I guess.
---
Anyong, Join us over on Arugal my friend
---
I was just thinking that, since I first saw him streaming a decade ago, he aged tremendously. He looks like a fucking adult, it's weird. He could be a father. He could have worked his way up to a mid level corporate career by now. It's fucking weird. He does still act like one though, from what I see.
---
He literally has "Raid Leader - Skarm" listed on the slides.
---
But is it? I am out of the loop here but a extremely rare drop drops that is perfect you but someone else who cannot use it gets it? Even if they are just joking with him
---
Cheerleading?
---
idk how it works, but they're supposedly making a mega guild with method and sodapoppin 
---

---
Well made post.
---
You're going to get downvoted and a mod will probably delete this post most likely. The new reddit accounts will keep saying "Ion said in 2 months". The only upside of Classic is Pservers can finally become 100% Blizzlike because they can emulate Classic. And the best part: no layering or massive pops ruining realms.
---
On my way to pagle rn.
---
reddit ToS lmao  
---
who cares about that, its not against the law
---
&gt;I find it ironic that people keep saying new servers are dead on arrival when just a few months ago when we were all talking about "what happens next" people were hoping that Blizzard would continuously roll out new servers to start the progression over and over and over.
---
Because Reddit is a singleminded entity where having different points of view is impossible?
---
Yeah, he was probably gay...
---
Yes! i have planned a full dungeon series &lt;3
---
On beta he helped me with a few things, and seemed like a really cool guy. Then during the end event thunderfuries were dropping. He asked for lead (I had RL from a TM/SS battle we were part of) and did ML - mistake on my part. 
---
First thunderfury he gave to the highest roller. The 2nd one Alphy rolled highest on and Esfand straight up jacked it anyways. Not like that TF was gonna last more than 30min, but still fucked up. That shit is like a piece lf history.
---
Ooze and Skarm are a bit more on the hardcore side.
---
I wasn't in Esfand's guild, so if everyone knew he'd be taking warrior gear for his ret paladin and were still okay with it, then who am I to talk?
---
where is skarm going?
---
These layering/sharding posts getting shilled immediately is rather comical.
---
When I use to play Goldeneye with my buddies on split-screen, I didn't look at their side of the screen. Just feels like something I'd be uncomfortable doing myself.
---
the biggest problem is layering allows a server to go over what it can truly sustain.
---
e.g.
---
say a server can support 3k concurrent players 
---
layering allows that server to support 12k concurrent players 
---
(these are both example numbers we dont know exact values)
---
the gamble is that 9k people (again we dont know exact numbers) will quit on every server by the time they have said they will remove layering (leaving roughly the 3k the server can support)
---
its a bloody massive gamble
---
Neither is botting in World of Warcraft, but a ban would still upset you.
---
A mild mannered discussion about databases and server technicalities made you so unhinged, sent you into such a blinded, all-red seeing fury, you scoured through months of post history to find out I'm gay so you can bash me on it. A mediocre discussion about World of Warcraft Classic server performance, at 2:49AM on a Saturday, got you so riled into such vitriolic anger, you decided the best course of anger was to write what you wrote above.
---
Take a step back and really look at yourself.
---
I remember cloakndagger too! My name was Ashyra, was a priest healer in Knights Empyrean through til early naxx.
---
Is there one of these for rogues?
---
&gt;You can aggro mobs and then just straight outrun them before even getting hit.
---
This was always true.
---
Streamers will be everywhere.  The avoid streamers movement is about specific high profile streamers with generally toxic and trolly fanbases
---
Drama like this was absolutely part of the original experience on the forums
---
I agree!
---
Right? 
---
“We’ll be good boys, promise. Greetings from guild Autismo”
---
Comedy.
---
Remember them too, but I was alliance — Ashyra human priest
---
link to working one please!
---
Yes they are. Get your addons sorted! :)
---
our maintank was 11
---
the shit we had to listen to on ventrillo lollllll
---
good kid tho. we were super happy to have him
---
because i was paying for it, yea
---
I didn't have to scour anything. We software developers build tools to do that for us, something you wouldn't know anything about. It took me all of 3 seconds to discover just how disillusioned and uneducated you are.
---
They can just kill rag next week
---
&gt; they wouldn't follow, donate, or subscribe just to watch a public freakout
---
Lol where have you been
---
SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEMS GOOOOOOOOOOOOD
---
lul tittsout
---
I dont understand the hate. This is a post for people wanting to be in his hardcore raid team.  It literally says there that the casuals are exempt.
---
Yeah, everybody here is willingly misinterpreting or outright strawmanning Soda's "Blacklist" idea in order to circlejerk themselves against it.
---
I'm planning on avoiding streamers by just not playing on their server... It's not that hard.
---
Has to be MOP - ANTE UP from the OG WoW vs runescape video
---
All of the alliance that stuck around to the end of beta have at least interacted with him tbf.
---
Also required!
---
Not necessarily packet lost. These could be hops that are configured specifically not to respond to pings.
---
Even if WoW was f2p, a ban would upset you. I'm not interested in compromising an account of mine just to save you the trouble of using google.
---
You can't prove that someone's sniping so this is a broken system from the get-go. Streamers just need to fuckin accept that sniping is the price they pay for all the benefits they get. Man-children.
---
Me and my friend intend to play on Herod (Alliance) and just try to play the game, but if a streamer's guild becomes a problem, we'll make them a secondary priority. I have a feeling, if the content of the OP's post is to be taken seriously, there are a lot of people who will share that sentiment. You'll probably have your pick of forces to join to fight the good fight.
---
Indeed. The horde is more of a dusk time of day, were everyone is tired. The alliance in the other hand is more of a midday and they still have some energy.
---
OOGA
---
RP rulesets are not really that strict now. Back in the day, plenty of toxic guilds rolled on RP servers.
---
It's pissed people off so much, I already got one guy below who scoured through months of post history to find my alma mater and the fact I'm gay so he can bash me on it and try to doxx me over this.
---
[It really do be like this lmao](https://i.imgur.com/PILfUPD.png)
---
My pleasure! &lt;3
---
Any time. That's what the sub is for! Good luck out there!
---
At least based on poll (only 200 votes though, obviously too small to really know if accurate) its almost 50/50 split, and as of rn, the discord server is split 201H 207A.
---
We will have to wait and see though.
---
Still sounds better than SJW servers LULW
---
\&gt;brazilians
---
\&gt;ragnaros players
---
&gt;true fans of classic want it to be as close as possible to vanilla
---
I like most of what you said but this is some grade A gatekeeping. "True" fans of vanilla want a ton of different things. You don't need to be a purest to be a true fan.
---
Your EU RP PvP friends approve of this poster. Keep up the good work!
---
yeah, sadly the old ones are really crappy, 3d software wise &gt;.&lt;
---
Havent your guild have established clear rules and the philosophy?
---
What's going to be out in-character roleplay for sharding (sorry "layering”)?
---
Evil void god ActiBlizzard is tearing apart the universe?
---
hahahaha.. you wanted to play an old game.
---
It goes against the spirit of the game.  Blizzard has historically banned and/or removed items from players that funneled goods by abusing the neutral AH.  Even players that paid money for a faction or server transfer for profit have had their items taken away.
---
You can't collude with the opposite faction for financial gain or to game the system, you're going to get banned if it's reported and investigated.
---
And if you're doing this in a legitimate looking way, you're going to get raked over the coals by the AH fees so there's really no good way to do this.
---
Were you Battle.NET friends?
---
It’s just that, a server dedicated to people that want to rp. People group up and have their own story for their characters, act out scenarios, meet other players in character, stuff like that. I’ve even done d20 rp using /roll and had some really fun dnd like adventures with many players over the years. Rp is pretty much a separate game in the game created by the players imaginations.
---
I wanted to respond about how this isn't exclusibe to streamers, but I'm stuck at how much your comment sounds like a Trump tweet.
---
Is this a cross faction or just a cross-realm whisper? Cross faction is a big no and they've said they want to limit that, so if this is post it on the forums too and hopefully blizzard can see it and maybe fix it.
---
Or if it is just cross realm whispers I think thats ok. I'm assuming I'll be able to whisper real-ID friends in Overwatch for example, and cross-realm is basically the same.
---
&gt; I didn't have to scour anything. We software developers build tools to do that for us, something you wouldn't know anything about. 
---
As a wise man once said,
---
["You think you sound smart, but you don't."](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cot2bh/layeringsharding_is_never_leaving_musings_from_a/ewl1mk9/)
---
Won’t lie, it gave me the chills! So hyped now!
---
No. I logged onto Blaumeux, made a character, targeted the first random guy I saw and did this test.
---
Yeah, that's where I feel Esfand just didn't take the whole "Raiding Ret Pally" thing too well.  They had a video where they were talking about their guild rules/loot prio and that's where the Esfand/Ret chuckle came from.
---
But yeah, it's not like Esfand has a secret ninja to take top items for his Ret Paladin.  He's there raiding, shows up every day.  It's different compared to stuff our guild dealt with in Vanilla with Druids wanting to take DFT (when they were raiding as resto) because they wanted to try out Feral DPS.
---
I don't know, whatever server Ooze's guild is going on.
---
not the same thing  
---
its only the "same" if you care about karma which is sad to begin with, so yea...
---
I’m not signing into Google.
---
With that said, I’ll be in the only non-PVP RP server in the US.
---
Why? Because I leveled on a PVP non-RP server and I think RPing would add an element to the game that I never experienced before.
---
I mean server forums where basically drama cesspits in vanilla too. So atleast we’re reliving the full experience.
---
Well with free a tion pots that hunter has like 0 chance fair. Even thistle tea might tip it.
---
I guess I meant if you know a rogue is lurking. If a rogue gets the drop on you unless you manage to get off scattershot you're toast. That 2nd fight isn't in the rogues favor though imo.
---
i am having a laff rn
---
I’m going HOTW for sure and I plan of switching to deep resto when I’ve had my fill of wPvP and want to focus on WSG
---
I don't care either way, but I don't understand why they wouldn't just add a toggle feature to make both crowds happy. Might even get more people to play.
---
It makes this funnier
---
The impact of these differences is blown way out of proportion. Are you seriously under the impression that hunter is now *literally incapable of success?* Because that's what your question implies. It was a powerful class in actual vanilla and will be precisely as powerful in Classic.
---
Freezing trap is pretty much the best CC in the game. In PvE it targets anything that can be CCed at all, unlike most forms of CC. In PvP, there is essentially no way out of freezing trap, all you can do is try to reflect it or hope damage breaks you out. When they aren't on shared DR, like on pservers, it allows for completely broken and unstoppable long-duration CC as a hunter can effortlessly scatter, run up, feign, and trap the target. It's practically impossible to do anything about it. Both abilities are still excellent with shared DR, it just no longer allows largely unpreventable, literally unbreakable, instant-cast, ranged, long-duration CC.
---
&gt; they have the worst scaling of any dps class in classic.
---
No they don't. They have the 4th best. Hunters are well above average for DPS. Only three classes are better. Hunter scales worse trhan warrior, mage and warlock. Hunters are better DPS than shamans, druids, paladins and priests.
---
Stop being hysterical.
---
Vanilla didn't have 10 million players all in the same zones you fucking idiot.
---
Right... *I* am angry lol. Private Servers have no sharing, so it's a completely different issue. Of course you don't know everyone, you never know everyone. But those people you do know will always be visible to you. Layering is like Xrealming, it completely destroyed WoW for me.
---
Whatever, I guess there's no solution here. We will see what happens.
---
FeelsGoodMan to be an EU player and not have to deal with this fucking man-baby :-D
---
Are there any streamers etc (other than the Apes lot) I should avoid rolling on the same server as in EU?
---
I actually like in Fairbanks, Alaska so it’s going to be dope
---
it will be the same as in vanilla
---
and that means it will be dead the moment BGs open up.
---
people on this reddit always complain about flying - while PvP was shoehorned into instanced PvP a year before people even knew about flying mounts

Grob mob!!
---
Not cross faction. Same faction, different realm.   
---
It's not real-ID or Battle Net friends.
---
It's still cross realm communication and blurs the distinct separation present in vanilla server structure.
---
ikr right I want me a hunter with a fuckin semi-auto rifle.
---
I mean, you still have to reload every now and then but depending on which it is it's pretty fast.
---
Imagine getting assblasted over "transphobia" and the word sperg. Lmao, maybe the internet is not for you.
---
World first happened like 14 years ago sooooo...
---
Is this real? 
---
If it isn't real, it further solidifies my bad opinion of this fucking doorknob
---
In some crazy places it still works. The ruins in hinterlands still have a parkour route involving forward+mount jumping that works fine. It goes suuper far up too.

So where does Barov come into play with this? You were on a character on Blaumeux?

It's a 15% cut from the neutral AH.
---
Really happy you noticed the squirrels! Moar coming &lt;3
---
Annnnnd my guild just decided on Herod earlier today. Christ.
---
Plus if you didn't hang out in ironforge all the time in vanilla you weren't nothing.
---
Sad thing is I remember when "gameplay first" used to effectively be Blizzard's mantra as a company.
---
Cross faction collusion isn't against the EULA.
---
I think their aim is Nost sized servers of anywhere from 8-12k concurrent onlines.
---
And name it &lt;Blacklist&gt;
---
Can I ask why do you keep up with what someone you don't like is doing?  
---
You don't like him yet know what his most recent stream was about
---
Enterprise SE here: it is often a single node in a json/etc config file. They don't have to restructure to set the max layers to one.
---
It sent because no error came up. Sending a message to someone who doesn't exist comes up with an error message but this goes through and shows that it worked. "No player named Asdf is currently playing".
---
what is this?
---
a voice of reason in this subreddit?
---
poor soul here have one upvote to aid you against the storm of angry downvotes that may yet come
---
Meanwhile Golemagg already imploded and Shazzrah is totally invisible on the meme front.
---
Layering is horrendous though, I really hope that it is either limited to 1-20 zones or only there for 1-2 weeks then just let it ride and see if more servers are needed.
---
Because there are usually 3 times as many humans as night elves on launch. And believe it or not, hunters are not that good at tagging mobs, their aa animation is long. Although that goes kinda still in your favor, because druids are the absolute monsters.
---
Right, I get that your client displayed a sent message. What I want to know is if the message *actually* sent. In other words, did you get a reply? It's very possible that this is a client bug and does not actually provide cross-realm communication.
---
My tauren feels pathetically slow...so i disagree...
---
"I stream btw"
---
Smth about her hit different
---
I played her a lot in heroes of the storm and SM is one of my favorite dungeons so yeah I’m a fan.
---
Would you mind sharing that special route :) :)
---
I originally was going to make this a meme about how memes didn't exist in Vanilla WoW but I thought that would be too meta.
---
Not to be on anyone's side, but big streamers get death threats at least weekly. There's some on this very sub.
---
Lok Tar Ogar Brethren!
---
Sure, they could turn the dynamic layering management system back on, but they never would.
---
are you a node of black lotus?
---
Nat looks exactly like Zach McGowan.
---
I will try and post an imgur link it may take a couple minutes.
---
thank you!!!
---
Yes, that's the point. I thought your thing was funny and played at overreacting at the corruption of "titty." But that's cool. Be angry if that what you want to do all the same to me. You're the hunter in this scenario!
---
This exact situation happened to me today during stress test and because of the annoyance of layer switching, the trade didn't actually happen.
---
We wanted vanilla WoW because of the community but layering is shattering the community exactly like in retail.
---
Thank you good sir &lt;3
---
I mean I'm not going to revolve my gameplay around other players, but if I was in the mood I would join the fray.
---
:3
---
People pretending to suck dick and do sketchy shit naked in the gold shire inn is basically what RPing in vanilla wow was.
---
thank you for liking it &lt;3
---
&gt; More servers.
---
Who pays for these new servers?  10k is likely the low end cost for a server to even consider for this type of work.  That is, *at minimum* 667 subs to pay for that server alone.
---
&gt; No layering, no sharding.
---
There isn't sharding, so yay for you.  No layering means launch will be a shit show.  I was around for BC, WotLK, Cata, and MoP launches.  They all sucked due to overcrowding.
---
&gt; If the player retention is really that bad, merge servers.
---
*If* player retention is that bad, then that means Blizz just lost a lot of money on those shiny new servers you wanted.  Also, maybe that shit show of a launch caused player retention to go down.  Or maybe the excessive number of servers that are ghost towns caused people to give up.
---
&gt; EZ Clap you're welcome.
---
Congrats, you just;
---
* Gave Blizz bad press due to their failure of a launch on their most hyped IP in years
---
* Cost them more money by having them buy servers that aren't going to get paid for now since
---
* Player retention was lower due to their failed launch and the dead servers that
---
* Have to be merged due to low populations and many more known problems arise from those merges.
---
Your 'suggestions' aren't sound for a business decision.  This is something that seems to be missed a lot here, but Blizz is a business that needs to be profitable.  As others have mentioned on this sub, but these server numbers are likely based on some metrics that come from a model that they use.  You can spout hyperbole all day, but these decisions aren't made to make just one group happy, but to try and retain the most people possible for the most money possible.
---
Funnily enough I think the only flow on from this will make the community element stronger on X-Realms BGs. You could argue it makes people more able to have alts on other realms I guess. Either way discord and bnet app basically make it a moot point in 2019 anyway - won't really make any difference.
---
Well now I have to figure out specifically what broke on mind. Thanks!
---
i have 15ms ping ok
---
Well that's your friend. To expect strangers not to take advantage is naive.
---
I’d say real good
---
The classic wow community is the worst i've ever seen in a video game and the game isn't out yet
---
How old is this man?
---
Tldr
---
Did he reply? Do you have 100 % confirmation that he received the message? It might have just disappeared into the void.
---
[how I feel](https://imgflip.com/i/37qteu)
---
Even during the heyday you wouldn’t really see more than 10k online per server. Obviously there were more servers then but I honestly think they’ve been smart. It isn’t hard for them to boot up a new server these days, if necessary. This is also what they did during the heyday, as required.
---
Oh my god the music choice I laughed so fucking hard
---
I like how we both got downvotes. Lol
---
Does anyone have any info on which PvP server any of the EU streamers are going on? Particularly the Apes guys.
---
There’s a treasure in Spires of Arak I haven’t been able to collect on any of my characters because of phasing. 
---
I think it’s the hammer near the cart or whatever, shows up on the minimap but disappears if I get within like 100 feet of it.
---
This would be a normal spergy kid's reaction to something like this. So bad lol
---
MobInfo2 does work, but you need the version for wow patch 8.1.0 which you can find on curseforge.
---
It has zero impact on anything. Like, literally zero as the person cannot interact with your server anyways.
---
You could have just not replied if you wanted to say the textual equivalence of silence. So now here I am in a difficult situation where I have to ask you "What do you mean by 'DOT DOT DOT'? What does your ellipses suggest?"
---
And before we get into anything further involving generations or ages, which is really what this thread what all about in the first place, let me just clarify that I am an older, but still usually included within, millennial. I am generally pretty pleased with how those in my age group are doing, all things considered, but it seems like when it comes to gaming, especially online, they tend to become their fucking parents. It drives me absolutely batty since I want nothing in the world less than to be my fucking father.
---
So, three periods got you this massive response, and if you dig through my history you're clearly gonna find that I have a big mouth and don't give two shits what people online think about me, so by all means. Please.
---
How about we blacklist whiny entitled people who try to use their teenage followers as a weapon instead?
---
youre making an issue out of nothing.
---
An image would be great, but "yes I got a reply" would work too.
---
I'm also happy to test this with you. Just tell me which faction to create a character on.
---
Resulting to petty insults definitely supports the logic of your point. I think we should all concede the argument to u/Electronic_Attempt. He wins this round!
---
Awareness for a bad case of the autismo.
---
They don't give a fuck at this early juncture because it's all speculation at this point....it could be a whole different ball game a month or two after release or it might be nothing at all. Toxic streamers and their neckbeard followers have the potential to ruin a server, that's a given....can't blame folk for having reservations.
---
Tfw Private Servers are significantly more Blizzlike than actual Classic will be.
---
Isn't this sort of thing against twitch ToS?
---
It's an action loot game.
---
Yes, Alex is a drama queen
---
You know what the term stream sniping is right? Using the information publically broadcasted from the stream to snipe them in game. So yes, it literally is stream sniping.
---
As complete layering skeptic, having played all 3 stress tests. 
---
I can finally say it’s safe and some what fixed. Since playing the most recent stress test, haven’t had been re layered ONCE
---
Why would he need to practice this? It's literally the easiest run in the game
---
I'm actually going on the server soda's in just to gank his ass over and over.
---
This happens to me daily. Also, has mid fights.
---
is it functional to you in any capacity if you disable other addons?
---
I just watched someone test this on YouTube. I think the difference was about 300 mana and 0.15 crit chance in top raid gear. So less than that if you’re pre raid.
---

I made it high enough at tailoring after farming scarlet guys for linen to make bags . Then went and stopped people near the undead starting area and gave them bags , everyone was super thankful. great fun to help people getting started, it sucks not having bag space at all. Of course if this was after release I would be rolling in the silver instead lol. I have no desire to make it to 60 super fast but I am planning on making bags for peoples mats for free  so I get that tailoring maxed and make the biggest bags I can to sell.
---
They wont disturb as asmon and the others.
---
I suppose "instant gratification" was an oversimplification, but I was using that as a TLDR to sum up my point that games like Overwatch, Fortnite, and League are all specifically designed for the player to be able to "obtain their fun" within 15-45 minute increments. Part of the problem with retail is that they've drifted more towards this model over time, which completely changed the nature of the game and what a lot of people liked about it.
---
Classic was designed to give players a long laundry list of tasks to accomplish so they will consistently log in and keep paying their subscription, but the payoff is more satisfying because it requires a larger investment (aka the "sense of accomplishment"). 
---
My original point was that not everyone is willing/able to invest enough into classic to achieve the payoff that really hooks people, and maybe that means that classic isn't for them, which is fine, but if Twitch numbers and game sales are any indication then these types of players represent a majority of "video game consumers" and the ones that play at launch are unlikely to stick around for long periods of time.

I mean you’re basically asking an ancient philosophical question that has been pondered for ages.

5-7 hour queues and not being able to play at all. A temporary solution, even if it's not ideal, is way better and you are acting like an angsty teenager.

The best part is, world first rag already gone. This guy just screeching thinking he's someone important.

he doesnt know shit about the game, and I remember like 2+ "hey guys im dealing with some RL shit prob gonna stop making vids unless you give me shitloads of attention"

This means that you can make a character on the opposite faction on a PvE realm and shit talk someone for ganking you for example on a PvP realm. This is essentially enabling cross faction communication on PvP realms.
---
When raiding reaches  the point of farm status  meme specs that have put in the time should be finally get a crack at bis items. Being a guild leader affords more perks but if it’s done fairly you’ll want those consistent players showing up week after week through progression to have an incentive to show up and continue performing.  
---
Attrition is and has always been the end game boss of wow. Having a well deserves pot of gold at the end of the rainbow is what helps keep people logging. If loot distribution doesn’t take player attitude, time investment, and performance into account you risk losing skilled raiders in the long run.
---
The 'literal god' meme is fucking sarcastic you bellend
---
I don't see OP making an issue, more an observation. But there are implications from cross-realm whispers. It makes potential abuse from a mob of players much larger. It also makes purposefully playing in BGs with players from another realm much easier.
---
This is wrong on so many levels. First of all, you dont queue the DB for text when people click an NPC. Not only does WOW not work this way, but the server will cache all of the static DB on startup. Mangos insisted on queueing the DB on every interaction, such as spellcasting, leading to abysmal performance in the beginning.
---
WoW is structured in a cluster, where you connect to what is basically a proxy server that is responsible for rerouting the connection internally between a whole set of servers. The connection for the player never jumps (wow doesnt even support having the player connect to a different IP)  so all routing has to be done by the proxy server infront. Whether the clustering system was already in classic from launch is unknown, but it was there in tbc and wotlk. The problem wow had in classic was that every area could only be hosted on one box ie: you couldnt let several servers handle Kalimdore for instance. This gave you the maximum number of players that continent could handle. Blizzard did not until later go down the route of seamless clustering, where you could have 1 server per zone, as Blizzard was pretty new in the entire mmo thing and had no idea what they were doing.
---
I was gonna say if it’s dead than why did it even happen and exist in the first place? I was in zig runs where a turtle pet off tanked some fights... I’m sure a Druid could manage there.
---
People mad at streamer=content content content
---
He can say that, but he seems super sensitive to the possibility of being hunted and targeted by groups wanting to grief him. I probably wouldn't like the idea either, so I don't blame him there.
---
But this defiant tone probably isn't going to make him play there. If he does, good luck. Personal army or not, some of those people are going to be poorly geared if they spend all their time following 1 guy. He can't run dungeons with 50 people. Determined sniper groups will be geared, and have the advantage of surprise. How long will he enjoy being a target.
---
Herod is now the people's server! #Hopeforherod

You do realize that you're the kind of people the blacklist is supposed to target?
---
&gt;Classic is Pservers can finally become 100% Blizzlike

Nope. They will never be 100% Blizzlike.. They won't even be 99% Blizzlike. I've played pservers since TBC.

I mean..... not totally false though lol..

Lol the difference between these two answers

Hum this makes my monitor decision harder again. 4k or 144hz!

Who the fuck pulls 1 mob at a time in retail? My dh can literally gather everything up, elites too, and aoe them down without even sweating. Youre just factually incorrect
---
Ooze made a video where he straight up lied about a story about me allegedly being greedy with loot. Was incredibly disappointed to hear that. I defended him multiple times when other people wanted him removed from our guild for a number of reasons. Was shocked he’d try and basically make up some lies about me to try and get traction on a video.
---
Shockadin baby!
---
The guy who can get spammed from multiple servers now.
---
If you want to whisper some guy who ganked you, you'd need a second account to create an alt of their faction. With this you can create an alt on some other server and then cross-realm whisper that person.
---
Man just be reasonable. These usernames are very important to the streamers. Those streamers are particularly important to the game. Unless Blizzard extends 'further privileges' to them, meaning this happens to set a bad precedence, this is a win-win for everyone.
---
you wont have to worry about the streamers on Grob they aren't going RP-PVP
---
Paladins - A support Class since Warcraft 3.
---
&gt; This clip is hopefully out of frustration in a guy who want to relive his nostalgic moment while having turned in to a job.
---
If they want that they can just play off stream. But nope, they're too greedy to do that. Not to mention PvE servers exist where you'll never get sniped.
---
He ran his own guild on one of the major pservers and was the kind of guild leader who plays ret paladin and insists on getting Ashkandi etc. Some people will understandably dislike that.

With only 5 servers, even 10 if you count PVE, people will be trying to grab their names on all. Good luck getting it, unless Blizzard has reserved them.
---
An alt with herb/alch is a good idea. I'm going to do that too. I wouldn't worry about your alts gear too much, just stay on your mount and run away. Most people you see will just be trying to farm for themselves not looking to pick a fight.

No, they said dynamic spawns were in classic, so they added them back into classic.

You're literally playing the strongest class in solo content and PvP with some of the best raid dpsing capability trying to tell everyone else they are wrong... Who would've guessed the cute little DH was a troll lmao

Any plans to make this a stand alone app? Really nice work
---
This what NA players have dealt with on the EU  pserv scene for years. 100-300ms is still not unheard. I still remember when K2 was ‘upgrading’ their network infrastructure and had latency upwards of 5-800ms making it completely unplayable. Just be mindful of mirror match ups and latency sensitive openers and you’ll be fine. Flanking and baiting out openers is a perfectly viable solution to a minor but noticeable latency disadvantage.
---
There were not plenty of bears.  There was a handful.
---
How will layering affect these events?
---
if you are able to read this join shazzrah
---
If for no other reason, people that could never ever meet up and play or interact in game in Classic just shouldn't be able to communicate. You cant even actually talk cross-faction on your own server despite being able to see and interact with those players. If I can't translatedly (just made that word up) type "lol" to a horde player, I shouldnt be able to talk to Ally from another realm. It's simply not Classic.
---
If you want to talk to your RL friends in game, roll on the same server or use a third party chat app. Classic wow should not support cross-server comms in the open world.
---
&gt;If only 1 million are playing that is over 90k per server.
---
Should be extremely obvious that every server will have a max limit of players. They aren't just going to let 100k people on one server. Once they hit the player cap on the server, queues will pop up 100%. Once Blizzard sees these servers with thousands of people in queue they'll add few more servers on the very first day.
---
Jesus fucking christ...
---
Luke?
---
Well, if they ever release "fresh" realms, those should have Layering until whenever they start their own Phase 2.
---
How could this possibly take long to make it?
---
TLDR It's not cost effective to give people essentially a no cost vanilla to play official and over stock servers that they know will become dead and waste money to appease the people who quit after 1 month due to the struggle to level at the start or just don't find the Official Release as great as the private servers / their memories of the game.    
---
If you can provide credible data to blizzard that say's your way is better I bet they'd love to do it instead. They want to make us happy and if they can retain more subs they'll go that route.   
---
tbh blizz could of just charged a 40$ remake game cost to add more servers.
---
Children and their over sexualized imaginations.  Just like all sleep overs have pillow fights that turn into lesbian orgies.
---
No, don't you know they are trying to summon cthulhu through streaming?
---
Reddit and taking things horribly out of context, what else is new.
---
For the people saying you can't wait to gank Soda over and over again, this is exactly why he's making a blacklist so he can actually enjoy playing the game.
---
I'm living in Japan and I'm going to  Oceanic : Arugal. I was considering Fairbanks, but Ill be playing about 9-10 pm which is 4am .. and that makes it very difficult. Plus Aussie servers will be fun and have no big streamers to effect gameplay.
---
I think I heard in an interview that I was only going to be the first week or so to weed out all the retail vacationers
---
Didn't see one layer change happen during the entire experience so idk
---
Do we have a discord? I'd make one, but I really have no interest in moderating it.
---
With so few PvP servers, i seriously doubt some streamer will have much of influence in anything, as there will be like 20 good raiding guilds per server, so even if he somehow manages to get someone backlisted in 2 of those, the remaining 18 won't give a fuck if someone sniped a streamer.
---
Check the forums, shills are waiting for posts about layering to defend it
---
I would be very surprised if this clown was even able to achieve this himself (without the help of others).
---
Please don't publish wiki edits to troll. You could easily just have edited the text right-click-&gt;inspect to create this screenshot.
---
But you can by making a new character on the opposite faction on a PvE realm and then cross-realm whisper what is technically the same faction for the new character but on the original realm even if it's PvP
---
The dh was just one example. Its bfa, remember? You get free 120s like candy. Im just gonna assume youre retarded and cant even handle the content as easy as it is, because otherwise youre just wrong.
---
It's a drop bear repellent.
---
Consider it confirmed. It makes zero sense to add it back later lol!
---
People should be working around streamers not the other way around.
---
We may make exceptions if it's related to World of Warcraft, but generally, leave the real world political stuff out. This applies to religious topics also. There are plenty of subreddits dedicated to politics where you can have these discussions.
---
 My name was Thexy for the stress test. I kitted 10 people in a full set of crafted leather gear. People wiped out the boar and scorpid population between Valley of Trials and Razor Hill. I just picked up the leather.
---
You fail to realize, you're part of someone's.
---
No that's proper thicc, what you're thinking of is fat.
---
Wait is dungeon leveling good? Got a source?
---
This is almost certainly the result of you using different spell effect CVARs through in-game graphical settings. It's going to be impossible to make Classic look exactly like Vanilla without some very painful console tweaking through trial and error.
---
You didn't even list Rammstein - Feuer Frei? Have you even seen the greatest vanilla pvp god ever?   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwSR1SHYZRI&amp;t=](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwSR1SHYZRI&amp;t=)  Maydie, may he live forever!
---
Raiding in itself is expensive. If you think 100g a week for respecs is a lot then I don't know what to tell you. It is very easy to farm the gold you'll need for your respecs each week without even using the auction house. I have done it just casually playing so someone taking it a bit more serious would not have a problem.
---
Let's steal his name
---
I didn’t edit it. I found it.
---
Those servers aren't going to have major streamers. The post about Herod is special in that it was posted after the call to serve as a kind of hint. In the 2-hour call I couldn't help but feel some information was starting to leak through the cracks, but I understand you don't mean to speak for any other streamers. In honor of your discretion I will say nothing more on the matter. 
---
I look forward to a more official announcement of some kind, hopefully before character reservations open up. It would put a lot of players at ease.
---
Exactly. So many people on here acting like bigger spergs than the streamers. I dont like asmon or anything. But I'd much rather play on a server hes on because it would be more fun than the boring play through that most people on here would have.
---
And his reaction for that green which get removed tommorow anyway.. i love classic. &lt;3
---
There's a group of streamers deciding on a server to play on. They do NOT represent all streamers.

no
---
I would say the only “big” streamer that might play on Arugal is Quin69 since he’s Australian but he’ll probably quit after 2 weeks when Path of Exile 3.8 patch comes out.
---
I feel exactly the same way, though I was old enough to play vanilla back in the day but never did, classic is something else entirely. I went on an adventure with a Paladin in Wesfall yesterday, completed some quests had a look around, died multiple times to gnolls... There's a level of RPG-ness that retail just doesn't have. Don't get me wrong I love retail, but it's really not the same as classic. Not at all.
---
That would be cool. Apparently when I was leveling asmongold tried to raid us and him and his horde of followers got cut down pretty quick. I am just worried about them getting such an advantage since everyone will give them all the BIS gear.
---
Pretty sure you can just write a simple macro like
---
/cast defensive stance
---
/equip [name of 1h]
---
/equip [shield]
---
 I get that problem in both retail and classic. Hopefully the below fixes it for you as well. 
---
Disable both the max fps settings. I think they are called max for ground fps and max background fps.
---
I'll whisper you from my home on myzrael
---
Yes, but that creates a larger barrier through effort required.
---
Instead of having to deal with thousands of whispers from their own server, they now have to deal with hundreds of thousands from the entire continent. And all the people whispering them don't have to interrupt their own game at all.
---
I played on an RP server because a friend played there, but I don't RP. But I felt bad one time I rode off ledge and through a group of RPers I didn't see. I don't know what they were doing, guild gathering or something.
---
So I made a macro key to apologize to everyone, in case I rode up on people again. I could hit they key and be on my way.
---
I played a bunch yesterday and it was the same thing even 24+ hours after launch. Totally dead cities. Like 8 people running around in orgr.

Jokes on you I don't have any

Wasn't there a video on WCM of this guy who'd spend all of his time ganking low level players? He got loads of shit on the forums etc.
---
You /wave and /dance to show you are friendly. Then when they least expect it, you fuck em.
---
I've seen a few clips of a few of them now, and mostly they seem pretty normal, with some notable exceptions obviously. Venruki Ziqo and co, and Swifty all seem pretty cool. Also nice to have a face for Swifty after all these years.
---
I would rather not play for the first week than gimp the servers forever
---
That's how I feel about all these posts about how bad layering is when no one has actually experienced the system we're getting at launch.
---
Since they hate it so much, I probably won't see any of the doomsayers in Classic, right?
---
pretty sure asmon himself even said he's not doing that r14 grind lol.. FUCK THAT NOISE. I literally do not have the time.
---
You're not supposed to be able to whisper the other faction on a PVP realm, at least not without a second account. Now you can.
---
We don't have streamers in EU with anywhere near the same following.
---
Checking around. Omar or Ian
---
Taliesin has announced he will be rolling Horde on ZT, maybe that will give the Horde a nice push.
---
Is there seriously a server called Blow Me?
---
So he's gonna double down on being a cunt to someone already being a cunt and try to stop them from getting anywhere on the server? lol so glad Im on EU holy shit.
---
Darnassus's auction house is inside a bear!

Around 5:00. As you said "for the first few weeks"- This is re-assuring.
---
As long as you don't disturb Roleplayers while roleplaying and you have a lore friendly character name, you're more than welcome.
---
Well they’re most likely paying for membership through retail gold then via wow tokens.
---
For people who claim to hate streamers you sure seem to be obsessed with them.
---
Are they a famous guild?
---
Roflmao
---
Streamers will be lucky to get anything similar to their first pick. They have thousands trying to take their name just for shits and giggles.
---
90g at level 40 and... God I forget what the epic riding skill cost. 400g?
---
Hehe. Cant wait for oceanic pvp. I hope chinglish joins us. Hes actually a good chap.
---
Classic doesn't support DX12, so it's got to be caused by something else.
---
That guy was ruining a PVP tournament in which hundreds of people were taking part in. That has nothing to do with the classic ganking, that's just disrupting a planned community event. Like ruining RP-events.
---
Horde
---
I don't think it's Blizzard's job to quarantine our prejudices to one server.
---
Fap nullifies the orc advantage to a huge degree. Restoratives cover a massive spread of non-dispel scenarios. Being prepared for pvp will give a huge advantage over any racial.  
---
It’s not ‘sexy’ but a dwarf with engi/consumes will be a nightmare in any pvp scenario.
---
I don‘t get people like you. Why for the love of God would you even spend and effort to follow these people and kill them? Every single stream sniper is like the idiotic kid at the beach who can‘t use shovel and bucket right to make their own sand castle, so instead they stomp the other kid‘s sand castles. 
---
Why don‘t you just play for yourself and let the other be? You go out of your way by fucking them over and justify it by saying: this is the price they have to pay. No it‘s not. Do you think receiving death threats by maniacs is the price politicians are supposed to pay and therefore not to be counteracted? Politicians also get fame, lots of money and prestige. Are death threats okay then? The scale is another but the thought is the same: streamers do not deserve to be fucked over, and people who deliberately try are just douchy kids.
---
This guy is a fucking wank stain. He comes out in beta thinking his shit is made out of gold and he is a godlike warrior and he sucks. You need a brain scan if you want to be on this guys guild.
---
That picture shows both people on the same realm???
---
Also take Chance and Sqwippy, names he regularly uses
---
I also don't get why anyone likes Asmon. Soda is whatever, he's a bit too dudebro for me but it's not like I cringe if I have to watch a clip with him. But Asmon is just so profoundly unlikable, so pretend-intelligent and so fundamentally obnoxious that it's a complete mystery why he has fans. He's like the Dwight Schrute of WoW.
---
I got downvoted to oblivion in all my posts about the dangers of Layering months ago.  Hmmmmm looks like I was right the whole time and it's a game ruining change.
---
It's something I would try to hide lol
---
Be honest with yourself.
---
Are you really okay with a system that shatters the world into pieces, that breaks the community, that was never part of vanilla and is also the main reason why many people hate retail?
---
Do you really want to accept that?
---
"You think you do, but you don't."
---
No, not true. Outside of very obvious sarcasm and memeing, I’ve been very honest about Ret as a DPS. I usually say you have to put in twice the effort and won’t get near the same output as a pure DPS.
---
Sure! 
---

I got around 150 ping on the US stress test server this weekend, which is pretty much exactly what I get on retail (to a US realm). I feel like connection speeds to the US have improved a lot in the past 15 years. Back in Vanilla, I was getting 350 to 500 ping on crappy ADSL, but those days seem to be long gone now (provided you’re on cable or NBN, I imagine). I mean, 13ms is obviously better than 150, but both are very playable and I get no noticeable lag with 150 ping.
---
He and his father ran a shady fraud business and were charged
---
By going over what they can sustain, you mean like having queues once layering is gone? Also has blizzard put official numbers out of max pop on a server and estimate of each layer on server? I tried looking and found nothing.
---
Are you really celebrating a guy that was ruining the duels in the community PVP tournament?
---
where is the source for that? lmao no they won't
---
He can use his fanboi army that is on call. And he will because it's available and he's a bitch.

In WC3 it's the same, his face on a cube is used as placeholder for missing assets.

---
Soda will never go PvE server. The main reason he plays WoW is for the PvP. 
---
What he will do is just not stream for a couple of months until the heat dies down. He already stated this.
---
GOON
---
posting in legendary thread
---
Indeed delay is not going to help streamers out at all. If for example I wanted to gank someone all you would have to do is pull up their stream, look at their zone, go to the zone and gank them. Even if it was like a 20-30 minute delay it wouldn't matter. You are going to be spending longer than that likely in a zone.
---
The only real options streamers have for this are.
---
Play in a very large group and have goons protect you. (Still likely wont keep you safe from a good ganker)
---
Don't cry about getting ganked. If you are going to stream to the entire world HEY LOOK GUYS I'm HERE QUESTING. Don't be shocked if someone comes and ganks you. Its going to happen.
---
Play on a PvE server. If you care only about money and want to keep your viewers happy and engaged and don't want to get ganked. Playing on a PvE server is probably the way you are going to have to go. Swallow your pride and play there. Your viewers and most of the community will understand the choice.
---
&gt;So what the hell is the current game like now?
---
I levelled from 1-120. I didn't talk to a single person, I just queued up in Dungeon Finder, got teleported to the dungeon. Did the dungeon. Got teleported back to where I was.
---
When I got to 120, it was all about unlocking world quests so I could grind Azerite. You necklace has an "azerite level" and gear has essentially talent choices on it. You need a certain azerite level to unlock those choices. I wanted gold, but gold rewards seemed rare. It was just azerite.
---
I rarely saw anyone in the world, I never spoke to anyone. It felt like a huge waste of time.
---
&gt;Or play BfA with the other 5 million subs.
---
Thanks for the laugh. Have you played BfA during the last few months? I have, I still play it until Classic comes out, then I'll give up on this garbage expansion until the next one comes out. 435 ilvl here btw if you want to tell me I haven't played enough.
---
If you've been playing this game for quite some time and if you played during the days they were reporting the number of subs, you'd realize the game feels more dead currently than any expansion during content drought. BfA feels more dead than fucking WoD. I've been playing since late vanilla and I don't remember the last time when this game felt so dead in it's .2 patch, one of the most hyped patches by the way. 
---
Sure, there are still groups of course, WoW is still the biggest MMO on the market altough they don't deserve it, but I can safely tell you PvP feels absolutely dead on higher rating and PvP participation is the lowest it's even been. That's a fact you can find. I saw you're talking about M+, well M+ participation is also way lower than in Legion for example. Another fact. I'm saying that as someone with 1k score this season, Legion had way better and more fun M+, I was doing it every time I could. In BfA I'm forcing myself to farm that shitty score to not be behind.
---
Now my personal experience. Most of the people from my friendlist I've added over the years don't even login anymore, most of them haven't logged into the game for months. My guild, I've been part of since MoP, died this expansion during BoD because simply not enough people were login in and we were struggling with filling one full raid. It wasn't nowhere as bad in WoD where we were raiding actively. All, not most, but all of my IRL friends stopped playing BfA like two months into the expansion and didn't come back. They're hyped for Classic at least. My realm, I've been playing on for years, feels more dead than ever even during peak hours. 
---
Now if being generous, I'd say retail has 2-3 million players. However I'm not afraid to say it's even lower, 1-2 million sounds also realistic. And deserved.
---
How's the Imperium doing btw?  I haven't checked in for some time.
---
I miss being able to just be and explore. I don't feel like I am on rails now. I can do what I want, the way I want.
---
He just explained how it's better.
---
Looks like the golemagg one became invalid again. Heard it was deleted as the other one was last night. Are there any new ones?
---
Let's keep commenting. 14?!
---
It's looking pretty close to 50/50, at least what we can tell from the organised guilds.
---
I don't think it is nearly 25%. More 5% or less. If you'd follow his stream, you'd notice similar names popping up again and again.
---
Source me -now-
---
That's not what he's saying.
---
What are you talking about? Paladins and shamans are top tier healers/supports in PvP
---
And how exactly is he going to know who is stream sniping and who just randomly walked by and then decided to corpse camp him?  If it's such a problem then just roll PvE where it can't happen and won't interrupt your stream, or put a delay on your stream, or hey if you're more worried about having a good time than running a stream for money then don't stream and just play for fun.  If you want to come back with some crap about this being his job so he can't just stop streaming and play for fun...well there are things that lots of people hate about their jobs and apparently this will be his.
---
I assume when most people talk about streamers, they're talking about the dozen or so most popular ones. I feel like most people don't care about small or mid sized streamers.
---
Sounds like a non issue idd.
---
Commenting for future reference
---
Unless you are in a speed running guild, none cares (even then, it hardly matters)
---
wow had to scroll down so much for some sense lol. I don't even like tips, but this thread is just scary...
---
I still wouldn‘t roll on Bralnos.
---
I’m probably just going to end up going PvE at this rate. This problem is causing too much headache and turmoil within not only my guild but the other guilds we were going to play with. I can just make a PvP toon in like 2 months when most of the casuals quit the game.
---
You will struggle if you mean like the day you hit 60 and youve been leveling as feral.  
---
You need a full or almost set of caster heavy gear.  Druids stuggle with lack of dispel, lack of regular rez, and they don't have great snap heals if someone other then the tank is getting hit, like for a mage on an aoe pull.  
---
Combo with a ret paladin fixes 2 of the 3 of those.  Play with a good mage who knows how to aoe without getting shit on, and understanding their defenses and that fixes the last.  Druids with engrineering are quite popular so you can try and use jumper cables as a backup rez.
---
Lol bullshit it's "misrepresentative of what happened" I have the entire thing on video.

Literally no one said "I wanna test this" but him. He banned a bunch of people from his chat for calling him a jackass, and several people ingame were pretty pissed.
---
Ragers/Harassers on PvP realms can now target you through the messaging system. Gold sellers/RWT will reach out to larger audiences with fewer accounts/less time.
---
Thank you
---
Server/world firsts will be done by people that have been playing together on private servers for years. If you're still recruiting at this point, I've got bad news for ya...
---
EU streamers aren’t nearly as big, and their fans aren’t toxic so it should be nothing to worry about
---
Why 40?  The beauty of open world pvp is you can go with 100
---
I mean, last time I watched him he was talking about taking time off to play classic because he didn't want to do the exact thing he's doing in this clip and that made me view him in a really good light. Then he does this...
---
What? Why does it have to bend over?
---
Yes, this is definitely cuts my enjoyment with classic, since as healer all i do is spam heals that now have this eye bleeding animation.
---
Given that he only killed once, why the fuck did they give it to him anyway?
---
I would have much rather given it to somebody who'd be back for the next raid...
---
you get my upvote, I'm honestly enjoying reading the comments of all the people that will literally destroy their own experience of classic to spite a streamer and then end up falling behind on the leveling curve lol..
---
Thanks so much! Haven't had access to the stress tests yet so this is really appreciated!
---
If you have the hardware capacity to run two "layers", you have the hardware capacity to run two servers.
---
Spawning rag early totally fucks up the raid.  He’ll just be sitting there and everyone will be in combat.
---
It can be done but you can't buy your own items. Even cross faction. You need a friend to put the item up for auction. That's what I did.
---
Yeah? Still makes them targets that don't have much in the way of response. And that only applies to organized PVP. They're both one of the easiest classes to gank.
---
In the stress test I noticed it’s much easier to kite mobs than on private servers. I think they run slower instead of you running faster
---
Disable any overlays from discord or steam (all overlays can cause issues). Update drivers as well just in case.

This isn’t for your issue, but it helped resolve my display issues.

Yes, but they still eventually kill him.
---
Thanks, I'll check it out.
---
You the man Esfand!
---
Anyone who kills a streamer. They're on a PvP server so they couldn't be whispered by the streamers following before, because they would probably play the same faction. Now they can just hop on to another server, make the opposing faction and completely spam down whoever killed the streamer.
---
Your strawman could feed all horses north of the Wall during the Winter.
---
It must be depressing to know that your audience comprises of people whose brains literally have not developed yet.  I guess they suit each other.
---
3/5 pvp servers are US east..... Brazill has expressed intentions on one and streamers are simply waiting until they reserve their names to announce people seriously have 0 patience.
---
I think you misunderstand what I am saying. They wouldn't have more "servers" They would have more layers. The point of layering is if you have 15000 people on the server, they split it up into 5x 3000 person layers. If primetime ends and there is only 9000 people on the server, then it's just 3x 3000 person layers.
---
My questions is with layering why would they also need login queues? Although I would much rather have queues than layering.
---
Eh. They’re testing it. Probably testing the scale too.  Starting zone orc was a nightmare when it first opened. People were spawncamping boars, scorpions, rathclaw, and the cave. Even with insta-spawn, good luck.
---
I’m sure that’s what they’re testing. Hopefully it gets worked out by then lol
---
I've been on Twitch since 2012 and I don't know who these shitty streamers are. I saw his name few times mentioned here and that's it.
---
In all my years everyone I’ve ever seen or spoke to has Called it DM.
---
So if you'd been using your character name since 1998 and some player 20 years later with the same name happens to get a large twitch following, and now you both want to play classic, you wouldn't be salty he had an advantage getting it just because he's a streamer? Now you're stuck on another server or with a different name.
---
You've got a whole bunch of "feelings" and no facts that lead you towards your assumption. You can look up the entire history of raid progress on wowprogress, cross-reference that with the number of subs at each interval and make a semi-accurate prediction of current subs based on that.
---
Or you can keep being stupid, your choice.
---
i'm so sick of a certain streamer's self-absorbed fat ass thinking the anti-streamer thing is about him personally. wonder how many people have gotten brained on a live stream
---
This is epic! &lt;3

There have already been plans for anti-streamer guilds that are specifically trying to camp them as much as possible. I find this hilarious and would love to see what comes out of it.
---
thanks, changed. Sorry, I'm EU so I was in bed x)
---
It is not, but if you are talking group pvp adding in kings for 10% stats starts making it look worth.  You are very unlikely to get grace of air or strength of earth from a shaman on horde.
---
Cedar Park, TX
---
You're an imposter!  
---
A true healer doesn't look at animations, only bars and move up and down.
---
You are horde, killing alliance. You get blacklisted on horde side, because your victim was a alliance streamer. Sorry, that's just bad. 
---
Ofc stream sniping is not the best way, but it's okay. When you ping your position to everyone, then ofc your enemies will kill you. But then demanding to other factions streamers that the guy needs to blacklisted by his own faction... That's just stupid.
---
Implying most of them wont be enha/ret because "it's ackchyually good dps".

clout seeking loser, fuck off already
---
Well nobydo is gonna remember the first classic rag kill but some leeroy or funeral raid lvl stuff is going to be remembered.
---
Im from Denmark and my ping is 15 so yours should not be that bad.
---
Man i really dislike this guy. He had Monkeynews on his show [https://youtu.be/KzQ4P6huu6M](https://youtu.be/KzQ4P6huu6M) and  what really triggered me was his bad job at getting good info from a really good warrior. Watch the end when they go through that BIS list, MN sounds kinda irritated by then lol.
---
I would've liked his content more if he went with a true approach, that he doesn't know much about classic and is here to learn with his viewers.

Then you can put them on ignore or report that person for harassment. Remember, this is Blizzard, not some private realm, they don't put up with that kind of stuff.
---
at best he will make an unknown alt while playing main on stream  
---
no way he is gonna quit streaming classic while its the hottest game on twitch
---
You port to org, fly azshara, get a new douse. Get summoned outside MC.  It’s not that hard.
---

---
It's not about faith, it's about a plethora of historical data on game launches where servers become ghost towns after a month or two forcing server merges and shutdowns.  They are looking at the long game here.
---
Is it a perfect solution? No.  
---
Is it the *best* solution?  I think so, and so do they.
---
The solution shown here isn't much different than what is seen in any number of other MMORPGs that have come online in the past decade.  Simply spinning up new servers as one server pop is reached is exactly what they're trying to mitigate because they **know** that new game release player retention is only a fraction of the initial player base during launch.
---
If Blizzard had this layering tech when they pushed WoW out in 2004, I have absolutely no doubt that it would have been used.
---
Also, you're allegation that this is all about money is also wild speculation.  With current gen server tech, spooling up a new server and spooling up a new *instance* of a server is virtually the same thing and likely requires relatively equal computational power thus relatively equal cost.
---
The hardcore crowd will be 60 before layering is removed in phase 2 and they will abuse all of its functions and bugs to mass farm rare materials. Ele fires, e'kos, devilsaur, black lotus. All gonna absolutely harvested by smart organised guilds that can layerhop.
---
every ten minutes some genius thinks he's being original and funny and asks where the heirloom vendor is.  it doesn't bother me, i just put them on my ignore list and keep rolling.  Gonna be a sad day for them when they cant get a group because half the server puts them on ignore for typing the same joke the last thirty trolls posted.
---
nope, I've uninstalled it wasn't working at all.
---
Ah I see your old time was over 3 hours and this is your new record. Gotcha
---
No, as we've already discussed, you can only get ONE Aqual Quintessence per week.
---
Withered Jim in the flesh
---
combining south park and wow is the best thing to do :D...cuz its true
---
If it's a single person, you can report them for harassment if they are getting around your ignore or creating a toon to harass you cross faction.
---
If it's many people, why do they all know your in-game name and server? Just ignore them all.
---
You got your terminologies wrong. If its google search away, its not doxxing.   
---
You're too much on reddit if you use it on mobile to the point of "ads" mattering.  
---
There are also plenty of adblock browsers for phones.

---
Ion estimated ~2 months from launch to Phase 2.
---
140ms is more than acceptable. Try it out and see.
---
I'm in Germany planning on rolling on a Pacific NA server, 140ms works ok.
---
His ego exploded alongside with his channel. I used to watch him a lot in 2016/2017, he was absolutely chill streamer back then. I even subbed to him when he got his sub button finally after a long time of not having it.
---
However I can't stand him and his community now, community full of toxic kids that have started watching him not even year ago and they're already worshiping him like some kind of god.
---
Man thats a very long time. People will be level 60 by then
---
ROFL
---
Thank you. So many on here seem to think launching servers POST-launch will do anything but create dead servers. Other mmos have shown us people would rather keep playing their original character (even if low lvl) and original server. Merging servers sucks but the one way to guarantee DEAD servers is not starting the game with enough and then adding more 3 days after launch.
---
Forsen and Greekgodx at most.
---
Proof?
---
The thing is with Soda is the whole blacklist thing. If it wasn't for that, I think most people would be alright with him.
---
As for asmon, yeah, it's a character for sure. He is a very theatrical person.
---
I've been saying for months that Classic would launch with a suspiciously small number of realms that are only meant to be used throughout phase 1, and will be replaced by a longer list of permanent realms that people can migrate to when phase 1 is over. It's the only way any of it makes sense, and Blizzard have already pretty much said that this is their plan.
---
It's kind of obvious when you think about it. They have no way of knowing how many people will arrive at launch, or how many will quit after a month. Blizzard haven't got a snowball's chance in hell of providing a suitable number of realms until several months after launch. So they chose to launch with a setup that makes it completely irrelevant how many players are on each server, and then they can roll out an actually suitable number of realms when they do know. It's honestly the best way to do it, people are just too hysterically irrational to see anything but disaster in everything Blizzard does.
---
Lmao this game is going to be so shit.
---
Then report them for harassment.
---
Entitled shit.
---
Take me Back by Story of the Year seems extremely fitting.
---
He's a literal child. Wow.
---
Which basically means that the streamers are planning to play on Herod. So... if you are looking to steal streamer names chose Herod and yoink away.
---
Using Reddit from a mobile browser fucking sucks compared to the app. And the app shows ads every ~5 posts without Premium. I'm sorry no one gives you gold or platinum or that you can't afford Premium, but for me it's worth it. And again, it *is* doxxing and it is bannable.
---
Could you give a link?
---
The Taldrassil one, that's right.
---
Owning stock in your fathers company can be pretty hard to get away from tbh.
---
you know if they would just be open with the public which server they wanted to play on, they would get feedback and be able to properly suit out amongst themselves as streamers and their communities where they should go.
---
and everyone can properly work around what they perfer.  
---
In the end after everyone has 60's in a week and we all know what server there on, everyone will make an alt there anyways.
---
Spoken like someone that never actually played vanilla. You remember other players names a lot more and you would be surprised how often you see familiar names in a major city in different gear and higher level like yourself.
---
What a retard.
---
Setting up premades across realms with people who were good in your last bg.
---
Whispering opposite factions on pvp servers after they gank you.
---
There will be more I am not yet thinking of.
---
Only to get to 60
---
That would be great, because we'll PC running for days , no need to save, #sleep4theweaks :D
---
Blizzard do not buy their own servers and hardware. They rent from server parks.
---
They should add more words to the list. Im sick of reading half the general chat with asteriks, blur the whole thing i dont want to be able to guess.
---
Oh he did much more than that.
---
All three links, including the one in this post, are no longer valid.
---
They literally do.
---
This is a good troll, I think this one has wheels for sure.
---
Took him 8:30ish on his run during the stress test, I didn't bother to check if that was a tryhard run though.
---
imagine doing this
---
holy shit
---
I was late the Heavy Metal game myself, around the time Vanilla actually released I had just started listening to System of a Down and Disturbed. Now as a full fledged metal head I look at this list and see some of my all time favorite albums. 
---
You’ve done the dark lords work, I look forward to grinding along to the real heavy this time around.
---
what
---
I'm not going through this whole song and dance again. If you can't be bothered to read what's already been said, then please go away.
---
Its not bad but you should be able to get it down to about 1 hour 35.
---
Cauthon Luck on YouTube has a good guide for tauren. My mate has used it and he was first to level 12 on Gehennas.
---
wotf the poly tho
---
"wow was the first mmo" triggers them too,
---
It's not a joke, Tips takes this way too seriously. You are daft. Watch the video and stfu when you dont know wtf you are talking about.
---
And my ass!
---
Nah, that fucker will be riding on Classic hype.
---
They should really just do a poll for server type if they only release 1 server for a region.
---
Although why anyone would think korea would prefer pve over pvp on average is beyond me.
---
&gt; Why are we flaming and getting triggered by a guy having a certain requirement for HIS own guild?
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Its completely reasonable and fine no? 
---
If he wants a guild with no priests or other slower-levelling classes then yeah, fine...
---
Noticeable in major cities, looks empty but /who shows 50 people.
---
Community, in general, is cancer.  *FTFY
---
Does the layering tech not mitigate/combat this?  Did Bliz state that there is an actual hard-cap on population, seemed like they were talking like they could spawn infinite layers, if necessary.
---
Yeah true, altough I feel bad for normal NA people, that have been hyped about Classic for years, only to deal with this bullshit now before release.
---
On EU servers all we have to deal with is maybe Forsen and his streamsavers.
---
Yes, I agree!
---
This balding dweeb is seriously worse at the game and less informed about it than that autistic maniac Alexensual.
---
What a clown. There’s much nicer ways to say what he had to say. He wants to look so tough and hardcore. No respect for tips
---
Drakedog and laintime do not approve
---
Why isnt Zzyz flexing in the background from the heavens!?
---
What will be the WoW killer?
---
No proof you can’t go back and get a second douse.  Nice 👍🏿
---
No, I believe at least when it comes to paladins, a lot of paladins will try to pve as ret. I think this because of Esfands popularity and browsing reddit, seeing the amount of people asking if meme specs will be totally unaccepted (because they intent to play one). And the argument that "MC can be done with only 15 players, why need 40 "real" specs?" being thrown around a lot.
---
It’s relatively easy to get 100 gold by 40 by just being super conservative with money. 
---
Back in 2006 i always bought stupid minor upgrades on the auctionhouse setting me back on the mount-saving.
---
Never buy anything you don’t really, research which skills you can skip while leveling.
---
Use professions to sell and etc.
---
So the problem is someone might log out, switch server, log in &amp; whisper someone of the other faction? I think you think people have more time on their hands then they do.
---
I love these people taking classic way too seriously, acting like cave-men fighting over territory
---
Just gotta report the streamer if they get too involved with your gameplay. Might as well hire someone to watch streamers and make sure they aren't making someone's game experience a living hell.
---
typical arab stuff :D
---
i dont need layering to lose my friends lol
---
go jack off to the sound of TTS reading your donation
---
Shaman ofc :) always tauren Shamans in the lead early.
---
Yeah they live in England
---
Streamers are honestly so dumb and full of themselves. Even if they go onto the same server, they will not even be 1% of that whole servers population lol. Their "community" which over numbers them thousands to one could overthrow em at any time.
---
There are add ons for looting faster if that's your biggest gripe. The one I got was called speedy auto loot.
---
You’re my favorite wow streamer! I start school the week classic comes out and I can’t wait to watch your stream when I’m too busy to play. 
---
❤️
---
Forever most likely, and yes it will probably ruin the game.
---
Next level skullduggery, I love this subreddit so much
---
Have you tested it in this scenario? Where you have a Horde character on PvP realm A, and can whisper someone on Alliance on the same server from a different realm B? I doubt there is any check, but maybe there is. Because if you don't have a horde character on A, what would stop you just rolling an alliance lvl 1 gnome to spam someone to your hearts content?
---
Frodo... Im up here! /Jack Black
---
140 ping is totally fine. You can’t even feel the delay at all.
---
lot of visible beds in those streams.
---
*ReTaiL iS GoNnA FlOp*

*ClAsSiC wOw WiLl FaIL*
---
Man I'm so glad you liked it. I can't wait to get home.
---
I’m not Korean but since I’m living here I will have to make the same decision. Ping will be a bit higher in OCE servers but the time zone is almost the same. I’m pretty sure Arugal will be my home server. Plus, aussies and kiwis seem cool.
---
You dont know him personally, while he seems that way, it might be hidding something, he groups with asmon and thats a redflag to me. Havent seen his streams so not saying anything, just saying.
---
alex was right
---
Insult his face, insult his noobishness, insult his past, insult his attitude.
---
But insulting his race makes you worse than him.
---
Whitemane brah
---
I guess you can RP not being trash
---
He didnt give us Beta keys. He is not cool. /s
---
I legitimately thought that he was overtuned when I watched the clip of Tips man-whining about him. I ran WC in Classic Beta right after that and we one-shot it with only 2 competent DPS(my third was a Hunter who thought he was a melee class) and a tank who keyboard turned. Even my Enhance shaman with like 3/4 an int set had no trouble healing it...
---
Why would it have any effect on the community?  You are all in the same chat channels.  You can still invite all those people to your group.  You are on the same server.
---
What I've noticed. It only happens if I'm fullscreen.
---
One problem with this is the amount of times I've seen streamers just blame any death they have on stream sniping. I get it stream sniping is annoying and sometimes its obvious. The problem is it's not exactly rare for a streamer to just be mad that they got outplayed or got ganked and just blame it on stream sniping even if it wasn't.
---
Waste of money if sharding isn’t turned off for phase 2 tbh.
---
Play what you are. Simple as that.
---
Tools doing nothing but enabling harassment shouldn't be left in because you can report harassment after the fact.
---
You don't? What kind of talent build will you be running then if you don't mind me asking?
---
Is this real?
---
"millions" lol. Most people don´t give a shit about this drama
---
This is so fucking bad...
---
Layering all around gives me cancer
---
I think as far as telegraphs go, a mix between FFXIV's &amp; Wildstars would be best. The problem with wildstar's was that they were on all the players attacks too and ruined battleground PVP because that's literally all you would see. It's a shame they never addressed that big problem as far as I know.
---
wotf the BLACKED
---
Not insulting anything nor anybody here. 
---
If u think to insult his face doesnt make you worse then him is also pretty poor
---
People with newborns :(
---
People with children old enough to grind for them :)
---
That guy is right.  It will be like LFG in retail where you are placed with a group of randos from other servers.  You are so unlikely to see people on a recurring basis you stop carrying about your interactions with them.
---
I've never known they once had different models. Do you have any pics of this
---
The number of servers available at launch is not at all indicative of the number of servers available ~2 months later when Phase 2 drops. Blizzard has already stated they are ready to launch new servers with free realm transfers the moment the population data shows they're necessary.
---
No one could answer that. But the witch hunt is strong. I'm totally out of the loop about whatever the f is going on with him but I can't see anywhere if this is a real screenshot or not.
---
Because why would you want to play an empty MMO?
---
It's a troll post, i think. The guy is legit bad in the game.
---
How can you be a grown ass man , with a wife, kids, a full time job, and not have enough discipline to get off the game. I know the game is addicting but it'll be there when you get back man.
---
Shhh... ffs common sense on the internet is NOT allowed!
---
&gt;Thex
---
blyat

You cant have layering forever
---
You made a racist comment. Plain and simple.

Why not just tell your girlfriend you will play wow? Can't she let you have fun?
---
Lol, what a jerk.
---
⎯⎯∈
---
Get'm boys!
---
Oh alright. Thanks for the conclusive answer!
---
newsflash, twitch culture is apart of video games whether you like it or not Pepega, Kappa no Kappa, BibleThump. but no really you will see all the emote names in chat regardless if the streamers are there or not.
---
I don’t even get why people don’t like playing healers.  Healers have the most affect on the battlefield than any other archetype.
---
1 good holy paladin in your wsg can literally be the entire reason you win team fights.
---
I fucking love playing holy paladin.
---
I hope you’re right but I’m pretty sure Blizzards giving us all the same run around they have been for years.

climb out of your own ass

man i love kpop servers
---
People didn't all start vanilla at the same time, when wow launched in 2004 it wasn't nearly as big as it was in 2006, there was never a big rush of players in the same zones. Not hard to understand.
---
Definitely troll if i want game to look good. 
---
Are you one of those , who play with lowest settings and max distanced camera? Without even anisotropic filtering (not sure you know what it is)
---
Well pointless comment when I’m asking a question

Besides I stream for fun I don’t make any money and don’t plan on it I mentioned my handle so I could link up with others doing the same thing

I'm not really familiar with why everybody hates tips, I watched a few of his deep dives where he invited someone to talk about this spec or this class.
---
I don't know if he's a douche irl or what but the hate I see here is baffling. You people need to take a step back and count 5 blue things in the room.
---
Chill the fk out.
---
I suspect Hunters are a popular class to level but not to main at endgame
---
Horde Character on Realm A (PvP)
---
Make alliance character on Realm B (PvE or otherwise)
---
Whisper Alliance on Realm A from Realm B, allowing cross faction communication and collusion.
---
I love Esfand he’s funny n such a lil cutie
---
There should be no censoring , or banning for any speech. Unless it's straight up racist, you needa grow some balls when someone tells you to fuck off or something. I'm tired of the internet evolving into a safe space for this coddled generation.
---
Wait, so that's what C'thun ment with "Your friends will abandon you" ? :o
---
This sub represents such a small amount of players that will actually play the game.
---
Also, I feel like a lot of players enjoy hunter but buy into the min max thing where hunters are no good post-bwl so they stray away from it.
---
What is sudoxxu?
---
Everything seems racist.. Doing everything correctly and follow the rules
---
Just Whites stuff 
---
Nobody gives a fuck.
---
dont push racism into every joke out there..
---
You accidentally kill a streamer. Suddenly you get bombarded with spams from multiple servers. You asked for a scenario, I provided one. 
---
Blizzard should remove the feature. “Just ignore them all” doesn’t solve it.
---
Not for a guy who fails the jump in WC
---
I did that at the start of BFA. I stayed playing for 5 months before I give up. About 2 months of that were just because I didnt want to waste my sub. Would have loved an ability to suspend it.
---
This is probably not a very representitive post in terms of accurace for the german players. This sub seems to be populated by a very high percentage of PvPers, anyways. Otherwise I'd be irritated by not even 200 people voting for the german PvE Realm.
---
Actually, never mind, my test was awful. That's good to know, thanks!
---
Dr Stream Snipe
---
What the fuck do you mean? Do you think a higher percentage of people raid now or in WoD when there was NOTHING to do but raid? There were 17,000 guilds that cleared Heroic HFC in 14 months when we knew the subs were around 5 million. There were 14,000 guilds that cleared Heroic Dazar'alor in 6 months.
---
How in the fuck could anyone think there's 1 million subs? You'd have to have some serious fucking mental retardation. I seriously wish I made a clip during Ythisens stream, when he scoffed at idea that the weakaura "leak" back in October was close to being accurate. 
---
Fanboy = realistic? Fuck that, you delusional people are fucking on something strong.
---
There's a box that says dynamic layering, and they're going to remove the checkmark in that box, which will disable.  Then a greyed out option appears and inside this box you put the number of layers.  They'll type 1 here.
---
But with cross realm isn't that a non issue?
---
Yeah but if you go mainstream you have to quit alright?
---
rogue/druid is potentially the best leveling combo in the game ; you tank with bear and he backstabs which is insane damage. you will have no issues killing things
---
Lmfao imagine being this whipped
---
Are you retarded? That's why it's hypothetical. No need to disprove the scenario, it was an exercise contrived to present my point. I guess i shouldn't have picked asmon considering how this sub overlaps with his viewer demographic
---
sure, just don't raid with him.
---
Acting like it was never a part of cross realm bgs
---
He's seen as a big fraud in the experience vanilla community. He never actually played in vanilla but tends to play himself up as experienced. And he kind of doxxed himself and it turns out he or his family business was actually involved in defrauding a client. I don't remember all the details tbh but he's not well respected in certain circles.
---
I would in no way hesitate in doing this. Unfortunately, I also didn't hesitate before insulting him.
---
Just cut your day into time slots like 12 to 10 work 10 to 12 wow 12 to 3 gym 3 to 11 sleep weekend full wow,  that leaves 2 and a half hours per week for annoying life shit.
---
You think we can't, but we can. It's not too far fetched for them to suddenly do a 180° on this - for various reasons. Also, Massive-Streamer-servers will be fucked as fanboys are less likely to leave / are repopulating layers. If Asmongo has layers full of twitch-chat fans on a server, the server could just be too full to play on without it.
---
What spam?
---
I don't have to know him personally to say that he seems like a chill guy on stream or that his online persona is nice. I don't really get this whole thing where people judge their entertainers on things they do outside of the entertainment. I really don't care what Esfand does outside of his stream. He could be a narcissist serial liar ninja looter but I wouldn't care. I don't have to support that stuff in order to like him.
---
Literally instantly downvoted.  Just further proof that people lurk these forums to circle jerk hate and attempt to push drama.  Literal the worst form of cancer in the entire community of classic WoW.
---
He is cool. He would be even cooler if he would stop playing that boring useless ret paladin.
---
Asmongold does aswell lol
---
Im not sure, how exactly they want to solve problem with open world bosses with layering on. They also clearly said, it will be gone. They know layering isnt loved feature by community and they could expect huuuge subscription drop if they keep layering in phase 2. They have whole 2 months to completely solve the population problem by releasing new servers and offering free transfer.
---
Dude can’t even talk properly himself, yeah fuck that how about Blizz makes these mongrels their own server and be done with it
---
No worry at all. My nostalgia is about playing on a realm with dutch and scandinavian people. Just checking if there is an unofficial northern europe pve server.
---
Some people seem very keen on ruining their own fun.
---
Strange indeed. The pserver I play on in EU (from NA) is far more responsive.
---
I'll have to fiddle with some tcp/ip settings, maybe that will help.
---
Can’t find a source on that. Do you have a link?
---
Not sure but I think its referring to aspergers.
---
/spit
---
((hey mate, I hate you))
---
She's wearing shoes. not pants
---
Yeah I was surprised by the high effort against him. I'd just simply not join his guild if I didn't want to, that's it. If he only wants speedleveling peeps that would be his, but on his Discord I can't find any information.
---
Maybe.. it was only a trick to get more Users on the Discord. *feelsbadman*
---
Seems like a nice guy but I find it difficult to watch his streams due to the ADHD changing of subjects constantly within the same sentence.
---
I totally get you guys are messing and joking around but it does make me cringe seeing people say ‘mommy’

Oh hellllll no. Don't fuck with the Sentinels!

If you got hooked, you were by definition not a tourist. A tourist is someone who leaves the game after a short period of time.
---
the private server version of this post is "It's free"
---
As long as i make it to the gym and worm everyday, and still manage to get 6-8 hours of sleep ill play as much as i want/can. I love the game alot but my fitness / career goals are what will matter down the road.
---
Regional WA here (15 hr away from Perth) I have only experienced vanilla on 450ms euro servers 
---
80 ping is a welcome welcome change
---
Hopefully we don't get sent to us servers for BG's though otherwise I'll have to reroll to a range class
---
This \^
---
Oh yeah Thalnos is 100% a no-go yet. I bet they chose it just because it sounds close to Thanos too
---
Never hit 15 on the stress tests, I was instead testing addons (and getting my loader set up so my UI is literally 3 button presses when classic launches) . . . that took like 6 hours, got my classic Weak Auras sorted.
---
Then I ran the undead starting zone 5 times optimizing my day 1 run (the guides really don't work that well for day 1 hour 1).
---
Because honestly, if I can get out of the super crowded starting zone in 2 hours (close so very very close), things are super smooth (also I'm doing my own route to 40, I think the various routes the guides give will be super overcrowded.
---
It was the same in Nihilum, where Kungen had first dips on every single item that was beneficial for a tank. If rules like that are stated when joining the guild, there is nothing wrong with that, since you know what you're going into. Exactly the same as doing BRD with reserved hand of justice.
---
LUL imagine having a girlfriend that expects you to spend time with her - some virgin
---
It depends on the server. For instance, if most of the streamers end up on herod, then that server will potentially have multiple layers until phase 2.
---
Also note that layering is dynamic. The server determines when to create new layers and when to remove them.
---
NOPE
---
No i can't release the secrets of the horde.
---
Lol
---
Given that the servers are virtual and running a 15 year old game I assume the cost for Blizzard is near zero.....they have all the server space from a game that has been shrinking for years to use.
---
Plus, something no one is realising: phase 1 will last MONTHS. That means lots of people will have they’re entire levelling experience from 1-60 with SUBSTANTIAL layering.
---
It flat out is not vanilla. Not even remotely close.
---
Didn't he said he don't want to play on a PvP server on his human?
---
I played during Legion (raided normal Antorus) from Australia on a European server without any issues. I plan on doing the same in classic, shouldn't be an issue.
---
I’m goin orc shammy
---
Wasn't planning on it. I'm actually rolling rp-pvp and hoping that they don't come ruin our one rp-pvp server.
---
He wants his guild to go for a week 1 Rag why wouldn't he have expectations of you planning a leveling route?
---
I fucking hate streamers, they ruin online games by dragging their shitty fan bases in with them
---
I have to worm everyday too.
---
Can't blame him for playing what he likes to play.
---
What’s a discord server? I saw my son typing on discord but the “server” concept confuses me.
---
How do we start a petition to have mages conjure food changed to conjure Vegemite cheesy scrolls
---
Mate, even with a full time job most people got like 5-6 hours of free time. + most people got 2 days off in the weekends.
---
I cringe so hard when i hear/read that people cant do certain things because of a gf/wife. I dont know your exact situation but if your gf prevents you from doing something you really love you might not be in the right relationship. Or you can just grow a pair and do what you enjoy.
---
I CAN SEE PART OF HER LOWER LIPS HNFGGGGGGGG
---
Well if you find it from outside the stream then it's not stream sniping/indirect stream sniping. I see what you mean now, I just took what you said literally and replied to that. 
---
I agree there won't be a good way to determine if someone is stream sniping or not. Obviously there will be stream sniping and there will be players from PvP guilds hunting down other players.
---
It must be annoying to get stream sniped but without knowing 100% for sure if they were stream sniping or not, the streamer will just have to put up with it/minimize it as much as they can and stop complaining as it comes with the job.
---
So any average ret paladin.
---
They will be able to see these trends as soon as name reservations become possible.
---
If they open more servers before the game even launches, whole communities will be able to move without problem. Apart from those discorddudes with their precious servers
---
People rerolled every time a new private server was released and the old one lost huge amounts of the population, so I don't see how you can refer to that as a source.
---
Back in retail Vanilla, Cenarion Circle RP server, I was a medium-low ranking member of the second biggest raiding guild on Horde faction and one of my RP antics involving pooping on someone's foot lead to the dissolution of the entire guild through the butterfly effect.
---
Serious question. Is this realm going to be infected by streamers or Brazilians?
---
Is soda thinks people wont form whole guilds and groups just to gank and shit all over his list, he's delusional.
---
Quin is a Kiwi, not that many care. Us kiwi’s like to take all the famous people we can ❤️.
---
Worst is seeing people trying to use hate to leapfrog their own Twitch or YouTube channels, by just riding the hate train.  Then when the game actually releases, they aren't even interested in playing the actual game.
---
Good I hope he never manages to pay it off.
---
Okay, so what I’m seeing is that if I want to play on an eastern PvP server, I cant play on Herod due to toxic streamers, and I can’t play on Thalnos due to toxic/non-English players. So my only hope now is Faerlina. I’m thinking a true Vanilla experience is out of the question, not because of blizzard, but because of our own community issues. That sucks.
---
This guy, or rather those people should go play on pve or simply get good to not be ganked. Bloody hell. It's not World of Peacecraft. If you play on pvp - you'll get pvp. Especially when you're being a dick beforehand. Waiting to see people get together to make his life miserable.
---
Take two weeks off work &amp; get her involved in the game. Doesn't take a genius.
---
My wife lets me have plenty of fun, but not 8-12 hours per day ignoring her while I stare at a screen levels of fun. At least not without consequences.
---
Which is why I organized a three week vacation for her, some girlfriends, and her sister and mother starting August 25th. That gives me and a couple other guys enough time to hit 60 and get raid-prepped before toning down our playtime to socially acceptable levels.
---
Can confirm. Accounts are region locked.
---
Obviously not.  But carry on with your pointless hate.
---
Arguing in hypotheticals is just pointless, there is literally nothing to substantiate the claim you present. I personally don't watch asmon outside of clips of him raging at something ridiculous, even if I was "retarded" I didn't resort to irrational name calling and trying to use fallacies to debate in a logical manner.
---
Hey guys, I'm still thinking about what will be my Farming-Twink.
---
Some information:
---
\- I mainly will play Prot-Warrior (only if my group can't find a raid/guild that doesn't need a Main Tank I might switch Fury) - this means I'll go for Blacksmith &amp; Engineer
---
\- My alt will have herbs &amp; mining and be a farming character I'll spend tons of hours on, I basically only want to run the most effective circles (from my perspective) over and over for hours and hours. 
---
Mage was my first thought due to their raw damage, not needing much Gear to kill enemies that I could pull while farming. What's the advantage of Druids though? I saw many people will roll them to farm. Don't they require Gear?
---
You act like ‘everyone’ will have to change names. Chances are very few people would, especially if the servers are underpopulated.
---
Oh dear :(
---
Not to mention 90% of getting R1 was queue sniping and having the right people to play with. Arenas was never really high skill but more about having the right comp and decent players to play said comp. As such popular streamers often get to choose whoever they want to play with easily.
---
I know this is Australian because I have no fucking idea what those products are
---
Hi utd2096- I created a similar thread about two hours ago but was heavily downvoted. I wish you better luck with your thread.
---
From the little research I've done into this myself, the consensus seems to be that layering will last "a few weeks". This phrase appears three times in three videos, BUT one of the technical directors does say "months" later in the same video, which is slightly worrying.
---
Give me 20 minutes and I'll find the video evidence with associated timestamps. I believe there are 3 relevant videos.
---
As a streamer, you can't control crowds. If this streamer gets big enough, there will be a crowd.
---
Because Chance is a man-child and an ugly fucker who needs to slice and dice the mole off his face

And my Vuvuzela!

Nope. I got to do the night elf area quest at level 10 as a human rogue during the stress test.

---
You must be new here?  Literally last 6 months have been people giving low effort 1000x repost threads 2000+ upvotes.  You do not know this sub-reddit.  50% normies 50% private server kids that think their fan server is a perfect example of what Vanilla was like in 2004.
---
That's the real stresstest grind tbh
---
Wouldn't have it any other way.
---
Dungeon grinding is much slower than quests or open grinding.  The mobs aren't worth shit. Get the quests for the dungeons but then  I would grind outside.
---
steal a name and demand 100 gifted subs as ransom am i right?
---
I think its Yahoo chat not classic you miss
---
Thanks for the reply
---
he could have done that, and have less money, because being a personality makes way more money
---
Can't say the worse : the bad meme, or your post.
---
It's not going to be possible. Even the two programs that work right now require the files to be present in the game and the Classic installation doesn't include anything for Draenei. Besides, they're both detected by Warden and Blizzard has already said they're likely to issue suspensions for them.
---
EU has only 2 servers? Are you kidding me?
---
"How is it affecting you" is such a shitty argument. Why does something have to affect somebody for them to have an opinion on it? I never played Star Wars Battlefront, Darth Vader costing $40 to unlock or whatever it was never affected me, that doesn't mean it doesn't matter
---
Joana FTW
---
that moment when even urban dictionary cant help you anymore... 
---
thanks
---
I think the official census is off. Probably due to the demographic that has filled it out it more likely to be min/maxers. Hunter always has been a popular class.
---
Your data is about what I would expect, although rogues seems a bit off.
---
Which is funny because in the movie she's actually snorting heroin without realising it.
---
Replay your comment, and nothing good comes from it!!! Awesome, right!?
---
My only guess for this is that both of your layers were full and the tech isn't there to realize that so it doesnt put you both on a third, open layer.
---
haha yeah, that one was so impossibly egregious, there's no way you would "accidentally misremember" that one
---
Well I guess you're talking about a model changer so that on your screen you're playing a female draenei instead of a dwarf ?
---
They are bannable for a reason and I don't know of anything like it for classic currently
---
You can add me to the “blizzard defender” list if you like but I can guarantee you, if blizzard don’t address layering by phase 2 I’ll be with you in complaining about it! It’s not what was promised and I’m sure the majority of balanced, reasonable people here on this sub will do the same. Obviously you always get extreme people on both ends of the spectrum. Furthermore, all of the big streamers and youtubers will be leading the charge of the shitstorm that would commence if we got to that stage.
---
But the game isn’t even out yet. 
---
My point is that arguing about it now makes little difference because we haven’t even allowed blizzard to keep that promise yet. Right now a lot of people are blowing their load on a situation yet to occur like it’s the “minority report” (if you’ve seen that movie). It’s just ridiculous. Are people this bored? I’m going to remain hopefully optimistic and see what happens and act accordingly like any normal human being.
---
Thought I saw some streamers say this isn’t true from their beta experience.  I guess time will tell.
---
He's talking about the 3rd party programs that let you swap models in the game. But in this case, what he's asking for is not possible in Classic.
---
Would Soda and Asmon play on different realms, or would they choose the same one to try and equal out the horde-alliance ratio?

Did you get this to work on classic?
---
I played at about 300ms during Vanilla. Did plenty of PvP.
---
My cousin was super stoked about this. Coming back to Retail after 6 years or so and nobody would ever buff him back. Now people say thanks, emote and buff back. I also RP my way to getting buffed (being the dumb Warrior I am)
---
U will add some addon which will morf visible look of your char from X to Y
---
Yeah, I get it if there is a problem, like a bug or concern with layering, etc.  It is literally 5-6 threads of OMG STREAMERS!  OMG STREAMER SERVER.  8+ servers a known to not have the main streamers...  People are either brain dead, or just doing it to have something to complain about at this point.
---
I get that the streamer servers will be cancer and people that want a more authentic experience SHOULD avoid them.
---
...but
---
As I said, 8+ servers have been confirmed to contain none of the main streamers. 
---
This community is so brain dead. lmao
---
You don't know that.
---
Hi, /u/Burturd

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/couqss/does_stress_test_progress_carry_over_into_the/). 
---
Exactly, on the Beta people were AOE grinding dungeons and getting tons of exp from that, even saying it was a faster method than questing outside the world. Plus on the launch, most people will actually be doing quests, and dungeons are instanced for the 5-man party that enters it.
---
bullshit
---
You are assuming that people have to reroll.  In actual fact what will happen is if both eu pvp servers are at significant queues for the first few hours or so, they’ll hit the button for a third server and know that 20k or so people haven’t even created a character yet and so are far more likely to fill the new server.
---
It’s a shocker for most on here but a very large number of classic players will not be staying up past midnight on launch day to play.  Sure lots of us have the day or even the week off but plenty don’t or can’t.  There’s gonna be a huge number of players who won’t even have a character made 24-48 hours post launch.
---
If that wasnt true then the likelyhood of them getting their names would be 1 in however many hundreds or thousands of trolls or fanboys divided by the small number of servers. Blizzard should totally allow them an early name reservation. They are providing all that free advertising. I dont watch any but it seems reasonable not to reserve any variations of Asmon-whatever but asmondgold should probably be held in reserve for him.
---
Just saying.. there are still Arenas on PvE Realms.
---
What a fucking retard!
---
I think he's joking? Looks like he's making fun of Maitoz from APES.
---
Adulthood over 9000

oof, get counseling

Reminds me of [Sharks Are Smooth](https://imgur.com/gallery/ad3je)
---
1. Warrior
---
2. Rogues cant tank
---
3. Similar rotations
---
4. Rogue
---
5. Both classes very popular and in 40mans there are about 5-7 of both of them, so competition is real.
---
Unless you are MT, you get everything first.
---
Every pro leveler I've watched in the last month says otherwise, but try them both.
---
He was no lifer player on classic
---
Arrogant not even responding questions while being sole GM 
---
I remember he doesnt even talking to frostradamus or jamjar (another streamer) or anyone in guild for being first 40 and wholeday farming sm 
---
No thank you i dont want to play with him.
---
Get your significant other into wow as well. Much better ;)
---
It’s not terrible XP - but out of dungeons is usually faster. Don’t underestimate the amount of dungeons you need to grind to level, though. The upside is that a lot of pre-raid gear starts to drop in dungeons in the 40-50 range.
---
This is quality!
---
can't wait to roll on Kobold Tunneler
---
I think he's just having conversations with himself.
---
You gotta macro that shit bro.
---
pitty in vanilla worked this :D  
---
 [http://www.wowmorph.net/](http://www.wowmorph.net/)
---
I didn't say questing in the outside. I said grinding(aoE) outside. Way faster than grinding a dungeon
---
These retarded streamers are seriously delusional, if they really believe that. 95% don't watch Streamers and don't give a flying fuck about any "Blacklist". LOL
---
I don't think so.  Having players divided into layers means significantly less chance of repeat player interactions with new players, likely to the point of making all interactions have no weight.
---
It will be similar to the interactions you'd have in retail's LFG system - you're so unlikely to see those players again that you basically treat them like NPCs.
---
As for the immersion issues, those should be obvious in  many forms, and will remain even when layering is working as intended.
---
Underrated comment
---
If you go 144hz you can use DSR to sample at 4k and still keep the high refresh rate. Considering that I'd go with the 144hz.
---
Dungeon grinding is faster IF
---
1. You know how to play your class efficiently
---
2. You know the dungeons very well
---
3. You have a good comp
---
4. You have a group that's all equally dedicated and able to communicate
---
5. You have the same schedule
---
6. You have a plan and practice
---
Some random group of 5 people jumping into dungeons and doing things as they come along is gonna waste a ton of time compared to just following any questing guide out there.
---
Please gank my paladin.
---
Not gonna lie I invented it myself just then in an attempt at sarcasm. Kind of a shit joke really.
---
No, my thread is constructive.  It gets people to realize how petty this is and to realize why people are doing it.  If you cannot realize this, you are brain dead.
---

---
This sub isn't a accurate representation of classic wow.
---
Both dps warriors and rogues are going to compete for leather items, so in that sense the warrior has 3 armor type options, whereas rogues only get 1.
---
I am biased towards warrior, but either class won’t be a bad choice. If you ever want the option of being able to tank, go for warrior. They’re fantastic off-tanks even in DPS specs, and as a MT they’re unmatched.
---
Now if only there was a way to convince Czech/sk people to do this in Eu servers.
---
Lucid Morph is coming to Classic, jMorph is not. But you'll only be able to swap models that are already in the Classic installation, so no updated models or models for races not available in Classic.
---
Tbh this clip shows a good thing. The streamers aren't the problem it's the people who want to troll them and be totally disruptive to others around them. By blacklisting them they will eventually fail and stop. Allowing the bullshit to cease. Everyone who is outraged by this is an idiot imo.
---
i wonder what Blizz thinks about a prominent streamer's handle being a KYS reference
---
Because layering doesn't work on a zone-to-zone basis - it splits the entire realm's population into portions of \~3k which can then see each other around the world. You're thinking of sharding, where people are automatically phased in and out to control population.
---
But yeah, it's very bad and I'm worried.
---
&gt; without knowing 100% for sure if they were stream sniping or not, the streamer will just have to put up with it/minimize it as much as they can and stop complaining as it comes with the job.
---
The obvious problem is that they aren't going to do that.  Any info gained from vanilla-style espionage is going to be called stream sniping.
---
true. If your SO stops you from something you propably have waited years to binge on for a week, I would say your relationship is kinda in trouble.
---
lol, dunno who you are but thanks for posting my pic
---
No, you were never able to use the Draenei model in Vanilla. It didn't even exist in Vanilla.
---
I think I saw him in a Retail Stream lately. But it doesn't matter if he is cool or not, if he plays with these other retard-streamers, he is going to follow their retarded shit.
---
Interesting points the ones you wrote here, what do you consider a 'good comp'?
---
We are planning on going as tank warr + resto druid + warr/mage/mage
---
Additionally, do you know any good dungeon order to grind untill high levels?
---
Thanks for your reply!
---
Thats the spirit.
---
gl with your sociopathy and fantasy
---
It will be faster but dungeon mobs are considered elite if I'm not mistaked, stacking them and killing them efficiently don't you think might be better? Just asking :P
---
Thank you for your reply!
---
lmfao i dont think anyone who uses the term "Sperg" even realizes that it's at all negative. It's just a meme term for gamers that spam copy pasta memes and act like morons ironically for comedy.
---
When you use one of these reasons to say x addons shouldn't be used or some other thing shouldn't be allowed (even though it was there back in vanilla) because that's what made vanilla better. 
---
That's not a reason why a games better that's arguing you miss chat rooms
---
His rogue guide talks about leveling builds based on front stabbing. Front stabbing is a private server only mechanic and doesn't exist in classic. A 30+ min video that will waste your time.
---
I've never argued any of those things, not seen many people do it either
---
What about us with the full time job, girlfriend and 2 weeks old son?
---
&gt; How much to Blizzard pay you a month shill?

What an original and clever remark! This right here is true redditing. Subtle, succinct and with a little friendly bite. Truly enlightening!
---
Golemagg drama continues; got deleted, link is invalid now.

Well that's just objectively wrong

You forgot rogue.
---
This is why I want to be on the streamer server. Massive war zones that can occur anywhere.
---
Nost was a better experience than classic will ever be
---
you cannot have a character in both factions on the same server...at least you couldn't in vanilla. I believe this still holds true
---
Thank you!
---
Well said. Great info for skeptical Hunters out there
---
Can't wait for these clips.
---
Is it possible to enjoy the game like we did in that time? This dude needs to put the meth down.
---
Is it Wrong to PUG in a Dungeon?
---
I am perfectly aware that it was in patch 1.12.
---
I think cross realm BGs was the first big step on the road to becoming the retail trash that WoW is today. It doesn't matter to me that it was in patch 1.12, it is still an anti-vanilla feature, just like LFR, free teleporting to instances, sharding, and so on. Realms should be 100% discrete, and anything at all that is cross-realm fucks with that.
---
I mean, I get that you feel different. That is fine. I just wanted to state my opinion. I am not happy with cross-realm BGs.
---
Found the source of the months one! Edited my original post!

As wild and crazy Alex can appear, he certainly seems to be right about other people. There’s been countless of shit Alex has called out, and been right about it.

And general tips for us? 
---
Any videos compiling which quests SHOULD be done on your way to 60? 
---
And advice on how to secure the lvl 40 mount? I'm thinking one of us will roll skinning and vendor it all, but what else could be beneficial?
---
So essentially the same problems facing all other realms?
---
That's really not the point though is it?
---
Calm down
---
Not money from an infrastructure or technological standpoint. Money from a CS standpoint. The department they cut by like 60% last year. 
---
Also, if your only solution to over/underpopulated servers is the same method used 15 years ago, I’d argue you’re not very forward thinking on this matter. There are numerous other way blizzard could either funnel players *or* deal with ghost towns. 
---
The thing people are most concerned with server transfers are name changes, and then tickets and boohooing. If they established from the beginning that until populations stabilize, the two smallest servers in jeopardy of lack of population, will merge into a new server. They could provide 5 days for name reservation. As you said, popping out servers is a flip of a switch. 
---
The issue is they don’t think many people will stay. They believe 85% of the classic population will be short term tourists. They truly are so out of touch that they actually believe retail is a good mmo. It’s a fucking single player transmog game. 
---
So although there’s speculation, don’t act like this was the only option. It wasn’t. At all.
---
lol, did this happen?
---
I doubt this simply because the server does not send the location of stealthed units that you cannot see to the client.
---
Pure gold
---
I mean that’s exactly why I want vanilla back🤷🏼‍♂️. I want a glorified chat room where I can dunk on people, people fishing sims, engage in duels, and sometimes get drunk irl and shoot bears at dragons. I thought that’s why we all wanted vanilla back?
---
That's true. But it is not a significant issue. I would agree that it needs to be killed, but honestly it isnt high up on the priority for me as it has zero gameplay impact.
---
You will love Classic.  Vanilla was the best version of WoW.  Started EQ in 1999 and moved to WoW in 2004, such a different game, but amazing in its own way.  Don't listen to any drama on this reddit, just dive in and enjoy it dude.
---
Idk I love holy annyway just think Arthes should have gone to stormwind for a little more purging.
---
For the horde!
---
Rogues last. Time to roll rogue and get raid prio because there is no rogues.
---
hey GUyS FOllow MY TWiTcH streAM
---
Preordered the new Tool album the other day.  Just waiting on Classic to drop so I can actually enjoy WoW again.  Where’s the fellow Tool/WoW players at.  Anyone wanna server up together and play classic when it drops? I’ll be rolling horde-Undead-Mage.
---
Stop saying EU has 2 PVP realms. EU has 5 PVP realms. In any case, the realm lists were posted mid-day Friday. Not having any communication after that is perfectly understandable.
---
Maybe they should've listened to the 5 million people who quit retail at least partly because of this?

Skinning and vendor all skins is such a helpful way to make good, also when you hit lvl 20 stop buying all “non rotation” skills.  Sinister strike 5? Yes, lock picking 62? No

Not using things like quest addons and others things that speed up the game is the 2nd most popular topics and the most popular reasons for not wanting them is because people enjoy the talking in the hours of non gameplay while waiting for a group for something

How do I gank steamers if this shit keep happening?
---
well he's like 15 years late on the whole world first train
---
Trivializing already simple encounters doesn’t benefit anybody but the retail minded people who have no idea what it’s like wiping more than once without quitting. 
---
Removing the already dissipating challenge of raids and dungeons isn’t a good look. And that’s what 16 debuffs do. 
---
Removing mounts so “people don’t feel pressured to level” is the most casual bullshit. 
---
None of these are world ending. But they’re demonstrative of a company that’s out of touch with it’s gradually depleting playerbase
---
I think you've mistaken layering with sharding.  The people on your layer stay on your layer.  You keep the same population, so will see all the same people.  When they remove layering, it'll merge all those groups of people into one server.  As if two servers are melding, but you will already have been hearing them in general chat etc.
---
Sign me up in a guild that wants to destroy Sodapoppin and other streamers.
---
Shedothedruid on YouTube :)
---
Oh god this guy is such a tool lmaooooo. These wannabe hardcore LFR streamers.
---
That would be some next level treason drama. Would actually pay to see that
---
He no lifes clássic but thought wotf dispelled sheep. He os probably wrath baby at best
---
No, I only just started fixing my addons today, doubt I’ll have enough time to fix this. I think the servers are going away Monday.
---
A bump in revenue might offset some of the cost of twitch and YT view bots.
---
Same here. Fuck Blizzars none of their games is worth shit anymore
---
I wanna clear naxx and then I'm done only did 2 wings in vanilla and it all ways bugged me I didnt clear. This is my second chance
---
80? I'm from NZ and I got 30ms for the stress test
---
Really crazy suggestion, hope blizzard doesn't ban me for this, but uh
---
...turn off the profanity filter?
---
I'll make sure to clap your ass cheeks on my hunter.
---
Kind of, yeah. Played GW2 when it came out with some average Korean dudes, and one guy who was considered 'good' and we stomped all over what is now the utterly dominant top team on that game so bad every time we faced them that they became a meme.
---
Just the "korean god gamer" stereotype gamers in the west have
---
Does Soda know what a pos this guy is?
---
There are only 2 PvP realms for English speakers, which is what the complaints are centered around. There's also a large portion of Spanish speakers in Europe with no dedicated realm.
---
I have several:
---
What are the odds of end game becoming stagnant in 3/6/12 months?
---
I last played WoW just after Cata came out. I only have up to that xpac, can I play with just a sub?
---
Will pve servers suffer much of the streamer drama that seems very common?
---
What profession makes staves?
---
Tons of people used quest add ons in vanilla and those who didn’t just opened a website for the quests that weren’t totally obvious to figure out. I personally haven’t seen these topics.
---
You can stealth or you can tank.  Pick one.
---
Thanks for your thorough answer! I get your point. I just tried to use Shift + mouse buttons, and that seems to work. Also, as you said, it leaves my left hand free to move my character at the same time, which is obviously useful in the thick of combat.
---
I meant for classic beta. %90 of streamers were baby when it is released back in 2003
---
Here's my playlist that I compiled from over 300 classic WoW PVP videos.
---
It took me about a week to put together and I've been adding to it with anything else that I find of the era.
---
Enjoy!

---
&gt;Overall best DPS class in PVE. (A lot of the fun I get out of the game is hitting those high numbers)
---
Combat Rogues have the edge over Fury Warriors for top DPS in earlier phases, but Warriors catch up and eventually overtake Rogues when they acquire enough gear.
---
&gt; Being able to tank 5 mans but not tanking in raiding - is this realistic? 
---
Warriors usually tank in 5-mans because tanks are harder to find than DPS. In raids you might not need to tank often but you will still want to have a tanking set for those times when you do. As a Rogue you're not going to be tanking anything.
---
&gt;What has the easiest rotation? I enjoy simple rotations 
---
Rogues have a dead simple rotation and are easier to play in raids because they can easily manage threat with Vanish/Feint and continue doing DPS. A Warrior has to be more careful with their threat to do maximum DPS.
---
&gt;Fun. What would you consider to be more fun at 60? 
---
Depends on what your goals are. Beyond raids, Rogues are solo-oriented and Warriors are group-oriented. If you want to be strong in 1v1s and small skirmishes, go Rogue. If you want to be strong in battlegrounds, go Warrior.
---
&gt; Side note I also don't mind if leveling is a slog, I really enjoy a challenge when it comes to leveling. 
---
Both Rogues and Warriors are mid-low tier levelers. People historically have said Warriors are hardest to level but I think they're both pretty close based on what I've seen.
---
That said, in the first phases Rogues are going to be stronger than Warriors because Eviscerate will do a ton of damage relative to the HP pools of most players. In later phases with AQ/Naxx gear levels, Rogues start to fall off because they need to blow more cooldowns to finish a target whereas a Warrior just keeps swinging and dealing massive damage.
---
Disclaimer: I played a 60 Rogue in Vanilla, a 70 Rogue in TBC (achieving Gladiator), and recently leveled two 60 Rogues on private servers. I'm going Mage for Classic because I want to be more effective in groups.
---
I preferee TBC as a PvPer. Wotlk ruined arena for me.
---
I started watching some of his videos when the classic hype started. Didn‘t know him before. First thing I noticed was how annoying his voice is and how bad he talks. I thought to myself: meh, who cares its still news on classic. When beta started I saw some of his dungeon runs and man this was embarrassing. I don‘t like him. He does not make good content and this post is just crazy. I shouldn‘t care but yeah. Thats the internet ofc I care
---
Having the unavailable quest icon be orange instead of grey on the map is really confusing -- is there a way to change that?
---
I use mouse for all movement, with strafe being on left and right side buttons.  All my abilities are on my other hand
---
Give a man a little power, see what he does with it.......
---
These gamblers and nerds are ridiculous
---
&gt; if anything I feel like they’re tempting streamers even more to play there.
---
maybe that's the plan?
---
No i like it on? I want there to be more words added to it as more get through then most realise
---
&gt; You love to make assumptions that suit your argument.
---
That's exactly what you did. Asmongold is farming a mount, everyone who tags the mob has the same chance to get it, and you act like if it drops Asmongold ninja loots it. 
---
You made an assumption that suited your argument that streamer=bad.
---
Why are you even still talking
---
I’ve lived in Japan since Vanilla. Oceanic is a trap. You want pacific US servers. Our internet here is fantastic and ping is never more than 80-110 after all these years. Oceanic I can understand for the timezone but there’s not enough players. Also they’re basically this regions version of Brazil. Absolute terribads.
---
Well fucking done.
---
Can anybody make a short looped Version of this?
---
Being an underdog and still able to kick ass is awesome. Seeing someone enjoying and "identifying" with a class to the extent that Esfand is, is really entertaining.
---
What are the requirements to pick up a mount at level 40? I know I need gold but do I have to pick up a quest somewhere or can I simply walk up to the trainer and buy it?
---
Ahh you want a glorified chat room where you can shoot beams at zombies. Good goal. I too may one day aspire to shoot beams at zombies. It I mostly just want to heal my way to a good elemental PvP set so I’ll likely stop after aq
---
This is what happens when someone gets a full time job being a fucking no lifer.
---
I‘m actually curious how streamer still can enjoy this game. It‘s like 2000 people following you and you can‘t do quests in raids. They will get ganked all the time. Maybe I‘m naive and they see all of this as purely as job
---
Easy solution, Camp them until they log, and then go raiding with your fellow Blacklist homies.
---
I’m planning on doing the rppvp grobmob, looks like a lot of fun!
---
NA dudes, please make life miserable for these cocksuckers.
---
I'll do my best on the EU servers.
---
Did you know he also had a dueling tournament in beta, **and didn't pay the winner their prize**?
---
I would say its not worth it untill Maraudon and lvl 50+. Those instances drops gear you actually use at 60.
---
At least hes not like asmongold who shits openly on classic now
---
I think some people also have issues with the fact that he doesn't fulfill his own requirement.
---
He didn't say EU has 2 PvP realms he said they have 2 English PVP Realms which is for the other 80% of Europe
---
Worst scaling:DD ok dude, roll a clothie and tell me in 2 years what happened to you against that t3 hunter with nerubian slavemaker who wanted to pick the same herbs as you
---
isn't soda a pos too? saw some vid of him having a massive sook over a BT glaive.
---
They are not suboptimal tanks, they just does not fit what you want to do.   
---
If you want to tank raids, then you should probably roll a warrior or a druid.
---
&gt;all other realms?
---
What is this even supposed to mean? Retail? What issues plagues them doesn't matter, we're not retail. PvE Servers? This isn't anywhere near as large an issue there because you can opt out of world PvP and the only thing the other faction can do to annoy you is tagging mobs before you or taking herb/mining nodes you wanted.
---
That's an anime reference my dude.
---
After seeing how he acts off stream on places like Twitter? No I can't say I think he's cool. Him and most streamers are toxic towards others quite frequently.
---
only one korean server and its pve??? blizzard ???
---
Actually disgusting. I can't wait to play this game with all of my friends and family, taking our time together and enjoying the same game we enjoyed in our youth.
---
I hope they do
---
You said I was misrepresenting the situation I was showing that I'm not simple as that. I specifically mentioned that it wasn't that big of a deal since it was only  gonna be around another 30 minutes. Just that I wouldn't be surprised to see him to similarly entitled things.
---
bye
---
It's not that Reddit doesn't agree with you. You're objectively wrong. Stop sucking streamer dick.
---
Teach me more senpai
---
you just wait for 3-4 weeks after launch. then you get a wisper about another gold selling site every 10 min till you eventualy get bullyed into getting a chatfilter addon. that will keep it quiet for a few weeks till gold sellers figure out a way to bypass it
---
It's easy to forget that Classic WoW is just another game. You don't die if you don't play it.
---
Ive really been enoying the stress tests so far. Shit isnt just handed to ya and levelling grind feels really good. Same with the 1v1 with mobs.
---
That is still 5 realms for EU, they just designated some of them to specific languages that can support it. look at how NA reacts because there are no Spanish realm...
---
Blizzard can easily add more realms if needed, and it can be very hard to calculate how many players will join classic, and how many stays after the initial month or two. 
---
With layering they avoid having a dusin half filled realms that will need to merge later, and it easier to spin up another layer or even a new realm if its needed.
---
Thanks! This worked pretty well. :) I just ended up slotting about the same spot Elvui did and blends fairly well.
---
completely doable, but after running the rest of the dungeon for an hour he can surprise you if you are not paying attention (which tips did not)
---
Dude, no one cares about your RL.
---
 "Shit, that group is a threat in the zone.. what's that? He's one guy who doesn't have time? Oh, in THAT CASE it's ok!"
---
P2W is not an insult, it's cheating for money, while giving companies an incentive to destroy their games with microtransactions and creating bad games with shitty systems to make microtransactions necessary.
---
How about this: play like everyone else, you greedy, self entitled, game ruining, family and business man with no time?
---
And yours isn't even the worst excuse.
---
goldspammers use /who to wisper ppl. even if you can wisper ppl xrealm, there is no way for them to find out who to wisper in the first place
---
1 server to fit in all the asian playerbase? Or are there chinese servers that you cant join for some reason as a korean player?
---
When you can't go back to 2006 internet
---
No requirements as long as you purchase your race specific Mount(s). Also warlock and paladin get theirs for 9g i believe.
---
You can reduce the cost by being honored with your race faction i.e orgrimmar for orcs, by 10 gold
---
And by being sergeant (this will apply later phase 2, not in phase 1) by 10 gold.
---
Reducing it to a total or 80g
---
Duskwood
---
Playing with Soda "I will blacklist the opposite faction" Poppin does not sound like you're playing with "good guys". There's video evidence on the frontpage right now.
---
Fucking disgusting cretin... I can't wait for him to baby rage all the time when he gets fucked over continuously and his "black list" just makes the ganking intensify.
---
Don't restrict it to Oceanic. It's basically hello in Scotland.
---
He is a tool. No reason to care about what he says.
---
Ah, so me
---
Wait tell this guy figures out you can chat to accounts playing warcraft 3, starcraft, and diablo too.
---
The Guild the Streamer Alkaizer is in will go for World 1sts and Tipsout won't even have a chance  
---
In 6 hours Alkaizer managed to be far beyond level 15 and that as a solo warrior.  
---
And there are actually probably a lot more hardcore nerd guilds out there.
---
This dude plays like he never played Classic and doesn't understand it at all.
---
Yeah people are really diving the community, people that dont want to get blacklisted because they kill streamer, people that dont want to level near a guy whom 30 people are following and other 40 ganking, people that dont want to see asmongold spam in the chat all day long. Is it so hard for big streamers to just not play on ONE SINGLE realm out of those 5?
---
Ok, who cares?
---
You think Classic NA will only have 130k players?
---
I found the word to be hilarious, personally. Great joke!
---
It’s the weekend. Wait till Monday to see what they do.
---
What exciting and fulfilling lives they must lead
---
He didn’t, obviously. All he did was to joke with the viewers by making a long sniffing sound.
---
EU don’t wear supreme.
---

---
These issues have been popping up since the beta over 2 months ago :)))
---
That makes sense, thanks a lot! Do you happen to know any good resources for where you can discover which skills to skip while levelling? My levelling-partner and I are kinda struggling to work it out. (As Shaman and Warrior)
---
Torvesta is daddy
---
Troll präst som är rätt hardcore letar efter en horde guild, behöver ni en healer så säg till :)
---
I mean.. I played on Nost since the start and at peak hours the view distance was really really short, and people were complaining a LOT about that.
---
Is warrior still enjoyable as a casual player?
---
Yeah, that's true - I'll probably take the thread down for now and check what they do.
---
But I think it'd be smart for them to clarify before the reservations at least.
---
OH THE DRAMA THAT WE WILL WITNESS :D
---
Why'd he get the item lol? Let the children scream, they'll get spoiled.
---
When he hosted the beta tournament he didn't even scout for places to duel in. It took them hours to find and get to the different spots. 100k people watched this shit over multiple streams.
---
can it do H/A ratio per region?
---
Cause thats not what i was referring to retard?
---
Source for this? Asmon says that he needs to reserve his name himself.
---
Why would you refuse to play the game before it even launches? Why not try playing and then  quit if you decide you don't enjoy it?
---
If I'm.being honest legion was the most fun I had in wow. That expac had everything and more
---
I know this subreddit has a hard on for hating streamers so I just wanna say are we sure this isn't just a joke?
---
Threw your stream on the other night expecting you to just be a bag of memes and i was still there hours later because of how chill it was. Props :D
---
/u/uimbtw [edited his post after my comment](https://imgur.com/fQgsSK9).
---
Back in Vanilla, Oceania didn't even have severs. Worse still, countries like Australia had even more rubbish internet (ADSL2 if you were lucky, which usually routed through some really shitty lines without a 3rd party VPN).
---
ALL pve content and most PVE was definitely playable at 250-300 ms. Playing melee was a bit rubbish in PVP, as you'd sometimes get these weird desyncs (enemy player would be in front of you client side, but you were out of range server side). Overall though, any class with a rotation just required a tiny bit of planning. Still 100% competitive.
---
Debatable
---
PLEASE FIX BLIZZARD! IT IS A PROBLEM! THIS IS NOT CLASSIC!
---
Jeez, gottem there bro.
---
thalnos is the sa server?
---
You tell me to stop sucking streamer dick although I am not defending them but attacking you. It is your attitude that is repulsive, not the streamer who is in need of defense. 
---
Well if you think I am wrong, then tell me why. Why is it okay to follow around other people to make them miserable?
---
i mean 140ms is not THAT bad
---
Zandalar Tribe are our comrades in arms!
---
How do you block entire channels in YT? Legit curious, I've got a bunch of...canditates
---
As if americans would care lol
---
I won’t stop because of layering, but I know the game is worse off. I don’t expect Classic to be better than private servers but at least it isn’t corrupt and the characters are more permanent.
---
Just buy the riding skill and the mount. Total 100g
---
You dont have much going on huh?
---
As he mentioned I edited it after he reminded me.
---
So what do you want? Blizzard opening a server just for ur private use? Does that sound better?
---
yes but it also bugs out, the addon mapster is no exception aswell.
---
The zoneing after scaling is fucked, no ideas here?
---
It was tips dad Katib Nazir or something. Tipsout did indeed work in that company.  But tips himself doesnt have really part innit. More info + legal documents can be seen at youtube: Notstaysafe . Videos made around 2nd of june this year. Interesting stuff...
---
Dont forget the pots
---
How is he a criminal tho, he was convicted, whats the point of court and the legal process if people call others criminals for the rest of their lives?
---
And so the baby threw its toys out of the pram and didn’t get to play with them at all.
---
Gimme gimme chicken tendies,
---
Be they crispy or from Wendys.
---
Spend my hard-earned good-boy points,
---
on Kid's Meal ball pit burger joints.
---
Mummy lifts me to the car,
---
To find me tendies near and far.
---
Enjoy my tasty tendie treats,
---
in comfy big boy booster seats.
---
McDonald's, Hardee's, Popeye's, Cane's,
---
But of my tendies none remains.
---
She tries to make me take a nappy,
---
But sleeping doesn't make me happy.
---
Tendies are the only food,
---
That puts me in the napping mood.
---
I'll scream and shout and make a fuss,
---
I'll scratch, I'll bite, I'll even cuss!
---
Tendies are my heart's desire,
---
Fueled by raging, hungry fire.
---
Mummy sobs and wails and cries,
---
But tears aren't tendies, nugs or fries.
---
My good-boy points were fairly earned,
---
To buy the tendies that I've yearned.
---
But there's no tendies on my plate!
---
Did mummy think that I'd just ate?
---
"TENDIES TENDIES GET THEM NOW,
---
YOU FAT, UNGRATEFUL, SLUGGISH SOW!"
---
I screech while hurling into her eyes,
---
My foul-smell bowel-dwelling diaper surprise.
---
For she who is un-pooped on is she who remembers:
---
Never forget my chicken tendies.
---
"MOMMY, TENDIES!!!"
---
Those are still arguments for vanilla being better than retail. Your false dichotomy can go away now.
---
*doesnt try game, writes off entire game before it even launches*
---
Your choice! I respect your decision.
---
Not worth because of the time required to finish a dungeon?
---
Oh it's still not fixed and release is coming? Boy am I shocked.
---
Nope. Besides some travel, this month is completely dead for me. And airports + long flights = lots of time for Reddit.
---

---
You think many people will take the free transfer when it mean leaving guilds and friends behind ?
---
Whats the point of the legal process and convictions if people are gonna get called criminals the rest of their lives?
---
They said they will a dozen times so i wouldn't doubt them on that one.
---
Only issue is what will happen if Classic manage to keep 3k active players on each server at any time. By then they should consider opening new servers and offer free transferts i guess.
---
Shoot the ambulance?
---
If it helps you, I moved from France to South Korea and when I play on retail from here I get around 300ms but it is largely playable to me, the only issue comes from finding raids and groups as the time difference is so big. I also play Apex Legends on US servers and it is playable as well.  
---
I would say to try playing on NA servers as I feel you can get a decent experience without much lag from them/
---
Sick humblebrag bro.
---
Realistically, yes. Robes of the Archmage are so powerful and will remain your best chestpiece (i.e. one of your most important slots) until AQ. Intrinsically that's not the core problem, but rather that there's no other robe pre-Nefarian that comes close.
---
I get your frustration, but I think you are exaggerating the actual impact layering will have.
---
I am not fond of layering in the first place, don't get me wrong. But Blizzard has underlined their stance on this several times:
---
&gt; If you dislike layering, worry not. Layering will only be used for a couple of weeks or maybe a month at the start of Classic WoW, in order to balance the huge influx of players in the same zones. Once the situation reaches a controlled state, it will be completely disabled and realms will once more have one instance of themselves. Layering also will not happen after Phase 1, the importance of that being that Phase 2 is planned to introduce the World Boss Kazzak, with the Green Dragons being released later on, both of which would make layering a tool to disrupt the flow of World Bosses in Classic.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=291722/layering-in-classic-wow
---
The start of this game will have layering, and that will not be the Classic WoW that I wanted to experience. But the game will not stay in that phase throughout its course. With how much the Classic Team has hammered in that they want to give players the classic experience once again, and how important that is for them, I don't see why they won't remove layering after the initial launch issues has been solved do to the population stabilising. 
---
Looking at the way the Classic Team has taken each and every criticizm point raised by the community and tried to do something about it, I can't see why layering will be kept in the game forever. This is not something I can argue will *not* happen, but I feel like the Classic Team truly wants this game to be good, and by saying that they want to get rid of layering sooner rather than later, that is where I will put my trust in.
---
Oh my, I can't *wait* for the drama. Gonna be legendary.
---
Warriors are the strongest class in the Starting area and can actively farm xp there safely , Lets pretend you're a human. you do the little back and forth for the wolf meat quest.
---
You will be able to take on 5 wolves at once by attacking one strafing to the next auto attack the second wolf and heroic strike the first while going to the next wolf. 
---
you can use this tactic till you get to the Defias which you will be able to take on 3 at once or second quest for kobolds and 4 at once.
---
Early health regen allows you to just chain pull the whole zone ( did a test run last night and did the starting zone in 29 minutes ) and that was with a rather full starting zone as i did have to wait a couple of times for mobs as well as Padfoot.
---
Great, where are we going?
---
Relax. I'm east coast and found a guild.
---
It was Tips too. You can find and read his testimony if you look hard enough. He was completely in favor of and helped execute these predatory practices.
---
“Awmagad another server has a culer name than mine!!!!!!”
---
yup, they're cultists that will drop everything to save dear leader.
---
Without cross realm battlegrounds, even some high pop servers had 2+ hour queue times in vanilla... Shit sucked, yo.
---
Once ever is too many times when you have the alternative to not ever have it happen.
---
A little bit of lidocaine makes every woman love anal.
---
Sudoku m8 what do you think
---
I'm only joking, I know you were asking which class he's going to play :P
---
He got convicted and went through the legal process tho, what else is he supposed to do?
---
huh?
---
“Wow! You really showed me some valuable insight with your 50,000 word essay. I think I’ll boycott classic release as well”-said know one ever.
---
The real mvp right here
---
Yes. You'll get your ass kicked from time to time, but you'll consistently be engaged in what you're doing. You need to be aware of your surroundings, and keep a close eye on your resources. Just be patient and you'll come out of it a much better player no matter what your level of commitment is, or how much time you have to play. Just have fun and embrace it.
---
You dont know what u talking about. People are talking about ACTUAL fraud he had with his and his fathers company. People really shouldnt open their mouth if they dont have 100% facts.

On behalf of Discord user tombowings (and on his request), I'm posting a Zandalar Tribe population survey. Please, feel free to fill it:

I'll tell you what's worse. Not being a kid and watching soda
---
This is so sad. Used to be fun standing outside og with 30 people duelling each other but that obviously is not going to happen..
---
isn't layering, by its very integral design, made to NOT do this exact thing?
---

---
You seem like a nice and intelligent person.
---
Streamers will more than likely stay to PvP servers.
---
Like many others in the thread, I didn’t see the problem until you explained it, and I don’t see any benefits from it, so I hope youe finding does get fixed! It has some really annoying possibilities.
---
I thought about it all day today and decided I’m definitely going warrior. Now I’m just trying to decide which line I wanna fall on. Leaning horde for the undead spriest alt but not positive yet
---
This is the one that's recorded and posted. Does not mean it's the only one. People talk about it happening offten enough that it's an issue.
---
This just made my day! Thank you
---
Chuuuuur bo!
---
“This generation” are the ones getting their shit censored... it’s the older generations censoring it...
---
&gt; Do you feel the same? Do you have some ideas what could be done? Do you want to say that I'm all wrong and I'm an idiot? Please write a comment, I'd like to hear what the community thinks as a whole. I might even reply if I feel like it. 
---
I understand were you are coming from. Lots of points you brought up I worry about too. However I'm going to give the game a chance. Could be the expectations I have about number of players etc turns out completely wrong or the servers in fact do get flooded but Blizzard quickly remedies the situation by adding many extra servers. We will just have to see. A one month sub isn't any money at all, I have no problem giving them that even if all the fears expressed on this forum turns out correct. Will just unsub if they don't fix things quickly.
---
Is that right? I'm from the UK and I know someone that wears Supreme.

Most common theme on the rant seems to be not wanting to feel like a nobody on a mega server.
---
Hey everyone! I'm Nymis, the leader of the [Kor Kron Vanguard](https://www.korkron.com/) and the raid you're seeing on the boat there. 
---
I went a bit into detail with the recent raid we had on the EU stress test realm in a [forum post](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=2037) over on barrens.chat if you want to see more screenshots. 
---
The short version is that everyone in the guild who was on the stress test rolled an Orc Hunter with "Kor-" in their name and a boar pet named "Alliance". We went to Goldshire, Redridge, Crossroads and had a lot of back and forth WPvP action that we're really proud of pulling in just under 24 hours of server launch. 
---
I don't understand why some people are getting mad over this, we don't really care about any other guilds playing on the server and we have a lot of fun doing these raids even if there's no loot or gold involved. We also didn't have any issues with layering other than the fact that we ended up with what looked like it was 2-3 layers of Alliance players after 30 minutes in Elwynn forest.
---
Streamers will kill any hard group content. Streamers will open the gate streamers will be the first with thunder fury and the hand of raggers.
---
They will have the rank 14 pvp titles with an army behind them to.make sure no one else gets it. Doing anything in a high end zone with a streamer in will be impossible. 
---
Basically anything where a group of people can push everyone else out of the picture will be impossible to do unless you're in the click.
---
Just think back to when you wasnt part of the clique guild and how long it took to get gear. Now that's gona happen on a server scale
---
That's the music from the original scene even :D
---
Hillarious generic playlist. Here is the good stuff:
---
[https://tidal.com/browse/playlist/23e5b3be-4922-4b1b-a0e1-38c60e98ac28](https://tidal.com/browse/playlist/23e5b3be-4922-4b1b-a0e1-38c60e98ac28)
---
No it won't, unless your jealous.
---
What a loser.
---
They won't, just logout and log back in and on a different layer.
---
As if people would need to depend upon the streamer's friends, guilds or followers to get geared in classic wow. People who got blacklisted would still gank them anyway. Even the most casual of players are going to find their way into guilds(regardless of black lists or not) that are clearing MC/BWL/ZG and at that point, that is more than enough gear for being "competitive" in pvp against some of the best geared players. I could be wrong, I have no private server experience... I'm only going off my memory from 2004-2006.
---
pre-Cata Raven Hill is still my favourite place in the game. I absolutely can't wait to go back and get my ass kicked by Mor'Ladim and all the Ghouls in the crypts again.
---
Did you acutally saw the provided picture? It's an ingame whisper not a Battle.net whisper, what are you talking about. Think a bit before talking shit.
---
I’m excited because the stream sniping spergs will stay level 1, more quest mobs for me to kill.
---
I do absolutely agree with you. It's unfortunate.
---
Jesus Christ someone get that man a sandwich.
---
I watched a video recently of a guy who just farmed to level 5 in 38 minutes. I'd say it's probably better to just grind whatever you can tag on launch because of the immense congestion.
---
They play on PvP servers for the privilege of engaging in world PvP. I'll just be complying with their wishes.
---
You're sucking streamer dick because that's the only reason you would not see this yourself.
---
Is there any example you can give of him acting terribly on Twitter? Its not that I don't believe you, I just don't have a Twitter and don't participate in it.
---
He has made me look a fool
---
If you play while not having much responsibilities WoW can take up all your free time. But if you have real responsibilities then WoW shouldn’t displace them unless you have serious addiction issues.
---
Yeah his whole upcoming is a fraud. Begging for money when he comes from a multi million dollar construction company owning family. Constantly gets the most basic facts wrong about the game etc. His videos are great but id never want to roll with the guy
---
Hardcore players almost inevitably have massive egos, it's one of the primary challenges of managing a raid. Source: was a hardcore player.
---
Soda at least is damn good at the game, unlike this idiot.
---
There have always been options to communicate outside of the game. In vanilla we used to chat with alliance folks in our (horde guild) ventrilo regularly.
---
It's not, a golden age is a specific thing and isnt an opinion at all
---
To be fair this is how raiding in classic is gonna be.
---
Is that the sole reason? The robes pattern is a rare drop in BRS right? Chances are I might not ever even get it. Just trying to weigh up whether I would be able to function perfectly fine and pick up Herb/Alch instead.
---
Aren't warriors meant to be garbage 1v1?
---
What if a single person act as different persons and makes your "work" for nothing? :D "ddosing" you :D
---
Qualifier: Yes I did read your entire post
---
***
---
Explain to me how you would even know if 'random xyz' is online and that you're not able to see them due to layering, rather than them being offline if you do not have them added to your friends list/guild. Unless you're actively tracking their activity (which is insanely stalker-ish, all things considered) what would be the difference between not seeing the player because of the layer, and not seeing the player because they only log on for 1 hour per week on the weekend (because that's all the time they have spare for gaming)?
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
The same deal applies to your 'economy' argument. Unless you were one of those few rare people/merchants who actively solicited the exchange of items in-city then it's fundamentally the same old auction house regardless.
---
The guild argument (with the thousands of members) is trivially solved by just starting your own guild.
---
+ Does being in guild 'ABC' stop you playing with guild '123'?
---
+ If you were in such a guild, are you actually forming meaningful relationships, or simply piggy-backing off the guild reputation/infrastructure?
---
Why do you feel a need to 'idolise' 'top guilds', and I'm pretty sure the only metric you're using to judge a guild is PvE progression (which is a terrible metric). If your neighbor has shinier loot than you, is that really all that impressive? Are they somehow suddenly more worthy?
---
You make such a big deal about 'social interaction' and how that would be your deal-breaker, and yet you're either actively taking steps to not be social, or fearing the negative outcomes of a scenario that would be self-inflicted (because you actively put yourself into such a scenario).
---
I would give you gold if I had any! Thanks for the laugh
---
I'm EU but tempted to roll on their server to do the same.
---
You guys are just ad bad as those retards who follow streamers all day. You're pathetic.
---
Most streamers are decent people that aren't deserving of hate. Most streamer fanbases are toxic hellholes devoid of any hope for humanity.
---
So, your fine fucking over South America, but not limiting the streamers server choices, despite the fact that they won't tell us where they're going?
---
Work and gf are problems that can be solved!
---
Ah, that icon/face brings back memories.
---
Since layering would not be a thing going forward from outside the first few weeks after launch one could possibly wait to play classic for a while. Sort of join when the population have settled. And join after you have read how the population is on this and that server. 
---
Now.... I am gonna play on pvp server EU. And there might only be two to choose from. But if I join a few weeks into it I will at least be able to decide between those two based on feedback from others. 
---
This is the way I might do it
---
u got me but we still haven't left the EU so
---
If you’re saying it has the most sub numbers then sure. But golden age doesn’t have a specific set agreed upon definition like you seem to be implying.
---
This guy gets it.
---
He blocked me on Twitter after finding out that I was the one that got McConnel suspended off Twitter, so I can't be the one to do that; all I can give is my experience with him and people he considers his friends like McConnell who are very openly toxic.
---
Stream sniping is not against the ToS.
---
Cross faction collusion, aka telling your buddies on the other faction to ruin someone else's gaming experience, is.
---
That's never how it was said to work. You change layer based on play session. Logging out was always ment to give you a chance to change layer.
---
That’s why you don’t move in with a woman!
---
I really do hope so. I'd love to play the game, but with layering not so much. I just don't see how we're gonna have just a few servers and after two weeks or a month suddenly the amount of people online is low enough to disable layering.
---
&gt;What are the odds of end game becoming stagnant in 3/6/12 months?
---
Endgame content will be released a little by little at specific times like live, new raids coming with new reputation grinds for gear/recepies. It all depends on your focus, after 12 months maybe...
---
&gt;Will pve servers suffer much of the streamer drama that seems very common
---
I doubt it, pvp servers are most popular. Maybe pve servers will be the first to die?
---
&gt;What profession makes staves?
---
No professions can make staves.
---
&gt;Are there currently any questing addons like Carbonite that highlight quest areas?
---
I think Questie might be what you are looking for
---
It's a random drop, but I certainly wouldn't quantify it as being rare. But technically, yes, you could never get it.
---
You'd be able to function without it, but you *would* be worse for not having it.
---
I'm not sure which gathering profession to take with Tailoring. I have always coupled it with Mining but feel like I should try something new. What are your experiences with this?
---
The base price is 110g but it drops by 10% at honored and higher not sure if it is 10% per rep tier or just a flat 10% cheaper
---
ie. idk if it will be:
---
110-friendly             OR                  110-friendly
---
99-honored                                      99-honored
---
88-revered                                       99-revered

77-exalted                                        99-exalted
---
There will always be trolls and people who take the bait. There is hardly anything to do about it.
---
If you wouldn't mind.. who's APES?
---
My thoughts go out to the both of you, it is unfortunate her father passed. It does warm my heart knowing that Classic WoW is having such a positive impact though. Good luck to the both of you.
---
Every Stress test nobody was sitting in cities they were actually playing the game. It doesn't make sense to be in the cities when playing a stress test. Nothing is going on there. Saying nobody was there is like saying everyone is in the leveling zones. No fuckin shit.
---
The spergs are the followers not other people playing on the server lol.
---
Alright, thanks for the help.
---
Agreed. The amount of bitching is insane. I might have to turn general chat off for launch honestly.
---
EUNE hasn't had russians on the server for quite a few years.
---
Maybe to enjoy the game they want those things to be fixed. If getting enough uproar the chance to be fixed is higher. Damn those guys for wanting to enjoy something they waited for like forever. HUR DURR PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT FIXING STUFF AND I SIT HERE SMOKING WEED. I DON\`T UNDERSTAND THEM.
---
140ms is doable. Make sure in PVE to get a latency indicator for your cast bar so you can use a stopcasting macro for max dps.
---
I was excited for a gray gun drop on my hunter. It was a whole 2 damage better than my starter gun.
---
The link is expired. Any update on the horde discord?
---
What is that sensation in my pants?
---
Layers have a limit. If someone gets invited to a full layer someone has to be removed from that layer to compensate. This is always how it was going to be from the start.
---
If a layer lasts forever it is called a server :D
---
I meant the spergs that DO join in on the server.
---
Only on pvp realms.
---
No, for raiding i would personally go alchemy/herb to save money
---
If you gank sodapop and get on jos blacklist. Then You're my hero! All blacklisted people By streamers are deities. Literal gods.
---
How would you measure the games peak in a objective way?
---
Why? Easier to be carried?
---
Why would people be in Duskwood in a stress test where you can only be level 15? I love reading the most moronic comments on this subreddit when talking about layering.
---
The reason farming dungeons was WAY faster than questing were simply because the BETA increased from 30 to 40 after a 1-2 months or whatever, people were geared to the teeth (literally BiS geared for their level) and could easily handle the elite mobs. This won't be the case on launch, you won't have enchants, you might have 3 blue items, 10 green items and 3 white items when you're 30 and if you don't have the right classes AoE farming (even with BiS gear) will take ages. Which is the reason people rented mages during the BETA for their SM farms.
---
There's a reason world records are done by people questing, if that wasn't the case you would have seen people grouping up on fresh private servers and farming dungeons. But you haven't, because it's much slower and not even comparable in speed.
---
Is leveling as a dagger Rogue *that* much more difficult than swords? 
---
Specifically, emphasis on stealth and massive crits, rather than combat.
---
More reason to stay clear of any streamer server
---
MadSeason seems like a pretty chill guy. Swifty, too. I don't know too many others
---
"Let me just sample this modern casual MMO that I can play for a few minutes per day..."
---
I guess it may have just been different per realm? I played on Shadowmoon, and I definitely remember it being called VC 99% of the time.
---
I can vouch that Esfand does regularly say what he says he says. I've heard it multiple times on his stream. I think he does try to push for ret acceptance, but I don't think he's ever said that ret is on par with anythjng like warrior, rogue or mage.
---
Knowing the game is worse right off the bat is indeed discouraging. Those things about private servers is true too compared to classic. Ups and downs I guess.
---
Where and what type of bags should should I buy? Im going to be a dwarf. I know you can by 6 and 8 slot bags from normal vendors, how do you get bigger ones? What are the largest available in Classic?
---
Instancing, layering, sharding. It's the same thing under other names.
---
I think they are more worried about being auto chat banned by the click report system. Not being able to use chat in classic can have some impacts.
---
I think he means abilities that were removed during vanilla so they are not in 1.13
---
Thanks for clearing all that up!
---
Well then, from my perspective it looks like there isn't anything "compulsory" for a Prot Pala to take - all the good blacksmithing stuff is BoE, Engineering isn't as optimal as I thought... So I guess that means I'll have a character that I can freely just spec over to Herb and Alchemy?
---
Mining/Herbalism will be extremely time consuming to level early on when you'll do multiple laps of a zone and not find a single zone. Skinning is the gathering profession you can keep on top of the easiest at launch if you want to level with one, and you can always drop it later when it quietens down and the others become viable to level.
---
How many oce servers are there? You know what ping is for NZers?
---
A good comp would be a group that's stacking synergies on top of synergies for the dpsers. Take your comp as an example, both the double mages and the double warriors can operate as high dps, but there's very little synergy going on. 
---
As for dungeon order.. there's not really much to say, just do them in order mostly. There was a fairly popular video going deep on dungeon cleave that laid out a route plan. I'm sure you can find it if you dig a bit on YT.
---
Thank you. 
---
I feel I've gained enough information from watching streams and putting 2+2 together I feel. But yeah. Might just be me.
---
Once again the term golden age doesn’t have a specific definition it’s all conjecture. A games golden age is literally an opinion. Volume doesn’t equal quality. Even if wotlk was quality
---
I mean, all the more reason to stream snipe with targeted PvP imo. However, I don’t have time for that or give a shit - so I’ll just make sure to not be on a streamer sever. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
There more drama with streamer here than /r/LivestreamFail 
---
amazing
---
I’ve seen some guides float around on reddit but can’t really say myself since I main Hunter. The only example I know is Rend for warriors. It’s a skill that really becomes less useful and more expensive after level 20.
---
&gt;  This is a thing people used to do when servers had communities anyway
---
Cross-faction blacklisting because a player had been "obnoxious" to players of the opposing faction by PVPing them? 
---
Oh PUHLEEEZE
---
The anti-streamers group are a vocal minority. Streamers are a vocal minority. Chill the fuuuuuck out. It literally will never be a problem for 99.9999999% of people.
---
Nice addition, thank you
---
You have to clear the dungeona fast (aoe / cleave) to make it superior to question. But you will miss out of reputation, which is a big part in classic.
---

Just so you know, if you want to get som gear from raids (to PvP) then you most likely will need to go Resto!
---
Happy Toteming!
---
It is very easy. You see how they react in-game to what you do on stream
---
Ret is trash and doesn't do competitive dps. 
---
Ok sorry. In all seriousness though, I don't see anything wrong with having to heal in raids and than bombing the shit out of people with your sulfuras in PVP.
---
I mean kids do play these games.

Also if those words were never prohibited, they would lose their ommph.

Lastly, anyone that says coddled generation has to be 40+.... lol. Get with the times you old prick.

If you're playing for amazing looking graphics I think you're barking up the wrong tree
---
Looks like your in the upside down world :D
---
Yeah you’re right. Luckily, we’ll have all the correct values and mechanics, so pservers will be better than ever. New development and a fresh server launch will be needed.
---
Yes! I wish this was the most stupid thing people rant about here.
---
&gt; deal with their thousands of toxic followers.
---
from what I have seen, they breed that toxicity.
---
Amazed you put in the effort to respond to these kinds of comments. I feel like people who are saying negative things haven’t watched more than 5 minutes of your stream in the past year. 
---
It’s obvious your whole Ret Pally rhetoric is a shtick, and your humor is overall very sarcastic. 
---
Thank you for taking the time to respond to people in the community.
---
Generally they come from random world drops and Tailors, so you'll be looking towards your friends/the AH for help with larger bags.
---
There are some quests that reward bags, [so this link](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-bags-storage) might be worth your attention to be more aware of what quests can help you out with free bags.
---
I really do hope that everything will be fine in the end, let's keep our fingers crossed. Maybe I'll get my proper experience in joining the game a bit after launch, like I did back in the day. Thank you for the read, and good luck on your journeys!
---
I've may have gotten my GF to play but when she understood the concept of a pocket healer she felt used. Maybe she'll jump on anyways :)
---
this is bannable and against the rules of this subreddit
---
Anyong! Anyong!
---
Lok'Tar !!  i have read some posts saying that Scandinavian or some other northern playerbase is planning to hijack this server bcz its "pvp"-rp and they  "want to skip queues" that will be on the other 2 EU pvp servers... it might be just hear-say. 
---
Anyway ... i am happy "Pertento" is with us here!

Guy who won the roll was a fury warrior, glaive was BiS for fury. Arguably better for a rogue, but still. He lost it and QQed and people pandered to some dumbfuck with a webcam.

blacklist anyone who stream snipes from all the guilds with streamers or streamer fanboys in them

Which makes your entire post useless?

Dont act like its a fact that new servers will be dead on arrival just because you think so.
---
yup, but part of what that idiom means is that the person is mad, op is just sad :P
---
It's just slower. Even if dps was exactly the same (which it's not), you take an extra 5 seconds per mob to get in position instead of running in head first and spamming SS. 5 seconds * 10,000 mobs is quite a bit of time.
---
Hey - now added Hydraxian Waterlords in.
---
Alex was right!!!
---
oh fuck off, stop buying their lies.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
---
&gt; early skinning mats are really only good for vendor trash?
---
Basically. Pretty much everything is vendor trash early on. The herbs/ore you would gather/mine wouldn't sell for much either as there's very little gold in the economy and everybody is being frugal in order to save for skills and mounts.
---
&gt; I wont be getting properly stuck in for about a month after
---
It probably doesn't change my response but it shifts the balance a little more. I'd still expect Mining/Herbalism to be a pain to level and still require significant time investment compared to Skinning (which is kind of done "en route" while levelling with maybe slight detours). The main counter-argument is herbs/ore might start to be worth a little more a month in as more players begin to focus on levelling their artisan professions.
---
Exactly my thought.
---
Vanilla WoW started with 10,000 people and bloomed to 1,000,000.
---
WoW Classic is going to start with 1,000,000 people and settle at 10,000.
---
Obviously imaginary numbers but you get the point.

I don't watch the guy, but I guess he's rolling on a PvP server and plans to get all butthurt when he gets killed. I'm sure that will work out well for him.

Wow this is so relevant to classic ty I have much to think about now I had no idea large companies did scummy shit.   Next you're going to tell me amazon is evil

Because they can save on server costs.

See you in game in 3 weeks!
---
(because if you have such a passion for this game that layering makes you write an essay about it, then it’s quite clear that you want to play this game badly)
---
No that's not how it works at all. Blizzard doesn't give a crap about this game and they have made it clear that they don't want to pay for a significant moderation element.
---
Look at a game they care about: overwatch. It's completely automated with streamers getting click report banned. Not just chat banned. Full throwing system banned. And there's video evidence on their side.
---
The real question is if you want to be able/forced to DPS/Tank, or “always be DPS. Warrior is potentially more rewarding but playing Rogue is”Cleaner” as you don’t need to respec and get double gear.
---
Now I kind of want to join a streamer server as long as it is PvP, its like a perfect storm, endless PvP! It would be the best of both worlds, world-pvp, my only regret is causing some poor retired mother being constantly awoken by their basement dwelling son 'REEEEEEE'ing after getting destroyed.
---
is your life really this pathethic?
---
do you need help?
---
As vile as orcs but without the stun resist.  FeelsBadMan
---
On the other hand healers have an incredible leeway regarding slacking.
---
Nobody will bat an eye if you come with the bare necessities of consumables (like 20% of what is possible) up until AQ40.
---
Do that as warrior and you will be cut off the raid roster fast.
---
Fair enough. What about a combat dagger build?

Ok but this made me chuckle so its ok

---
well you just ruined my coffee time with this info haha!
---
I didnt even thought about reputation! Thank you so much for your reply
---
Completely wrong mate. They are keeping it across the whole world for phase 1 and supposedly removing it in phase 2 where they think the populations of the servers will go down. As another guy has replied to you with the maths, there would be 38k per server; probably more of an imbalance due to server type with even more than that on pvp servers. The game was build for a population of 3-5k. Private servers had populations of 10-15k and that was far too busy.  So in the end, its likely they are going to keep layering past phase 1 unless they come up with a good strategy to deal with the massively overpopulated realms. Opening new realms and offering free transfers is one method, but even then I personally wouldn't want to take that option as a player that just leveled a character on my chosen realm and may have made friends along the way. The whole layering + barely any servers tactic used by blizzard is not good at all for the community, and thus the game overall.
---
you got a little more then two weeks before the game launches, start telling her now that you will probably be busy for X amount of days. I've been telling mine for the past several months and expressing how excited I am to play. At this point shes fully aware ill be playing the game no lifeing it the first week, and she has no problem with it. Also helps that my girlfriends life doesn't revolve around only me, she also has hobbies and things she likes to do.

the guy that gave up streaming for months so he can play classic private servers?
---
yeah definitly gonna give up LOL
---
fucking retard
---
Played him like a fiddle.
---
Fuck yeah. I'll be Horde on Zandalar EU
---
I guess that's just  how it is if you join a guild before the game even launches.
---
Raids usually want at least 8 shamans too, so I wouldn't be too concerned
---
Imagine quitting something because of how it will be for the first few weeks. Yup even found friends who share that opinion.
---
Neat.

---
Then you lose audience interaction. People could also just not stream snipe.
---
Can you "tag" a mob by just sheeping it? Or do you have to deal damage to it? 
---
And if you can´t, what if you damage a mob with a spell and then sheep it. Will the mobs stay "tagged" by you?
---
this
---
There really is no reason to burn the guilds resources in MC/BWL by making them respec all the time when you want to have them dedicate lots of time later on.
---
By making them respec early on way too much, you will burn out people who would be absolutely willing to do it once it is necessary (which it is not up until deep AQ40).
---
and noone wants that
---
Yes because it leads to lack of sequels :/

Which food or drink item will you always have with you during the first week of the classic launch?
---
Bonus points if it isnt water and or fruits or veggies
---
I mean sure but if you are not running 16 points in holy you dont get illumination, which totally fucks your effectiveness as a healer. You could totally go holy/ret and keep it on for everything especially if you are willing to sacrifice repentance, but then you don't have access to *reckoning*. A ret with no reck is a fucking sad ret indeed.
---
I didn't say he had to change it. I'm just saying that he has been rude and unprofessional about the matter, which is true.
---
I couldn't care less about some millionaires audience interaction rofl
---
roll on a pve server or stfu imo
---
Taxes are the worst. The majority of what they’re spent on is even worse. I wish I could avoid them too.
---
He'll have more delay due to batching than because of his ping.
---
Been playing since TBC, so I have an idea what I'm getting into :)
---
If you're rolling on our server, please consider filling our the **Zandalar Tribe Server Population Survey**
---
[https://forms.gle/5Kb7mfrdmJPH5yqK8](https://forms.gle/5Kb7mfrdmJPH5yqK8)
---
Yeah, that's not gonna work when they reach their 40s and have to spam BRD/ZF. They *will* get ganked then, and ganked hard.
---
I would try killing all your non-Windows processes. It might be another piece of software that is causing this.
---
Are you stupid? How can OCE be this regions version of brazil when they're already in the same region.
---
I used to use this mod all the time as well and would love to see it return. Your WeakAuras version looks really good though, was it tricky to make?
---
Farknn carnnnn maaateeeee
---
I don't think he gives a fuck lol, hes making hundreds of thousands playing WoW all day
---
You’re still gonna be in a layer of hundreds of people. Without layering you would be competing with thousands
---
Are you ok man?
---
I'm rolling whitemane no matter what, so it'll either be a non streamer server, or a streamer bloodbath.
---
Why do you want the dungeons to be even easier than they already are?
---
No I'm not 17, I've been playing since TBC so yeah I'm hyped :)
---
So rp realms are gonna have a bunch of people who dont rp come around and fuck it up.
---
Thats really what i fear the most with classic. With so many people having so much experience and time and it being a big event. I hope everyone wont rush to raid or pvp or something. I just want to enjoy the game at a normal pace and but because of tryhards like this everything will be done before. All they are doing is shortening the lifespan of the content for themselves instead of taking it all in.
---
The point is:
---
1. ppl don’t believe blizz that they will change the layering system, but come up with some shitty excuse that it won’t work.
---
2. Creating new servers AFTER start and make ppl go there can just fuck everything up (that’s how most dead servers were created in vanilla as far as I remember)
---
3. world pvp will be wired as fuck for the first phase.. which is in my opinion the most fun phase, no try hards/farming spots, only pvp for fun and to mess with ppl 😋
---
&gt; It can have negative consequences. RWTers/Gold Sellers reach a larger market much quicker, addon similar to badboy probably fixes that.
---
I don't think that will be an issue. Do you except them to just brute force attempt names? You can't /who people on another server.
---
Most people won't quit over a minor inconvenience happening once in a span of many hours of gameplay. 
---
The vast majority of people who have been posting in response to comments like these are looking for something to point the finger at and use as their excuse to hedge their bets for when they realize that classic isn't for them. All that blizz has done right is completely overshadowed by any issue found by the community. 
---
What killed retail wasn't Blizzard, it's the community. That same in community has a lot of overlap with classic community, as evidenced by threads like this one. 
---
There is about 600 hours of VODs for the stress test that are freely watchable that show nothing like what is in the OP here, yet this thread is filled to the brim that react to the clip with threats and ultimatums. 
---
If something like this can break you away from the commitment that is classic then your heart wasn't in having fun playing a game, it was firmly planted in being and anti-blizzard reactionary. 
---
People are going to respond to this with downvotes and comments to the tune of, "The entire reason why we wanted Classic in the first place was community and a consistent game world, this is unacceptable. They saw how terrible sharding was on retail, yet implemented here to a detriment to the experience. It's unforgivable." 
---
Those comments are stupid. Any reasonable person can see the good that has been done and can see this is a no-win situation for the classic devs. They remove layering and we have 40 day long queues, unless they open up dozens more realms, which will leave a good majority of them dead in six months. It's common knowledge that most people logging in during the first week won't be here in half a year. There are a million reasons for this, there will be tourists, there will be retail players who are curious, there will be a ton of people who just won't be okay with the lack of instant gratification and the pace and content that are present in the leveling experience. The fact is classic will have a ton of players when the numbers normalize, but the normalized number is going to be a tiny percent of the day one loggers. 
---
The tl;dr here is that there are fucking gigantic number of people that dominate the forums/reddit/discords/streams/etc that are just wandering around looking for reasons to hate anything blizzard does, and a lot of them are backed by the fear and trepidation in their minds that classic might not be the savior of their gaming lives. They are going to find anything they can to hedge their bets so when they wash out they can point at layering, brazilian players, streamers, not enough servers, AV not being 1.0, etc. 
---
No matter how hard you try you're not going to be 15 again, and it will never be 2005.

He's cool but also solely to blame for the horde of Ret Paladins we are going to get! :D
---
Calm down its just the stress test.
---
Calm down its just the first week of release.
---
...... again they gave 2 guaranteed servers they wont roll on, just like everyone else they want at least A chance to reserve their name, except unlike everyone else they actually have clearly thousands of trolls or whatever that will take their names just to spite. yet people don't understand why they may want to hold on on announcing their server and then threads like this are born. it's insane. from an objective standpoint.

This is amazing.

yeah so its literally irrelevant to you, why are you talking

Outlaw Sabre is an insanely good sword u get from doing a dungeon  quest in bfd which u can do solo. There's also vendors in ratchet and crossroads that sell green weapons that u want or a Grey mace called hammer that has realy good dmg bought in tb. And some more but those are the ones in my head rn
---
Because part of the atmosphere of a MMO is a coherent world where everyone sees the same thing as each other
---
is there an addon just for having available quests pop up on the mini map? or a quest addon that can be reduced to that? i want to keep the experience of finding my own way to quests but i do want to make sure im not running past a quest that i cant see
---
Link? Google has shows results only for blackfathom deeps
---
If you think the last update we've gotten is that they are definitely not playing on those two servers then you're probably out of the loop. They'll announce which ONE server they'll ALL be playing on pretty soon.
---
It's not about difficulty. It's about the social faculty and choice that was available in Vanilla and should be available again at Classic.
---
10 man dungeons with friends on occasions are great fun
---
All the good ones.
---
I've been using an air fryer recently for frozen chicken, i also like to use it for potatoes.  I'm probably also going to have a bunch of sandwich ingredients. For drinks I'm not too sure what I would want besides water. Pretty sure energy drinks are a bad idea due to crashing potential.
---
They have 0% chance to get their names.
---
Seriously what is up with you Aussies? I swear that everything there always trying to kill you has turned you all into super humans. You have spiders...that eat birds. Tf do you even do about that? Stab it with a knife so you can go get your darts and VB still?
---
Yes I would have been able to play. Could I have rushed off and quested without taking to anyone and never have to wait for a mob spawn? No but I would still be playing the game.
---
krol blade isn't that good.  I mean it's great and all but it's a boe epic it's price is stupid inflated it's not a huge upgrade from thrash blade which is free and it gets replaced quickly at 60.  if you find a krol blade sell that shit and I wouldn't recommend buying it even with you saying you want to go slow.  thrashblade is sick
---
OpSec is part of MMO PvP. PvE servers are still there.
---
You calling me toxic is clear desperation. And to be clear, I do hope your mouth isn't full of streamer dick in a literal sense.
---
you think that's bad? Try having 1 English speaking pvp server
---
Possible this turd PAID for a spot? Seems like the exact type of thing he would do.
---
Then... let's levelpping with exploration.
---
Im so glad i play on Eu servers. No big streamers here.
---
Streamers are all a bunch of crybaby losers. Honestly think they should stick to BFA if they can handle classic
---
There's no way to prove anyone is a sniper. It's pretty clear from his phrasing that he feels entitled to some sort of "immunity" to pvp entirely on his own terms, expecting his frothing-mouthed fan base to enforce his thuggish demands.
---
Its not just that. I tuned into his stream back in the beta when he was high and mighty talking about how he was gonna MT as feral and it might be annoying for him getting to raids because he has so many people following him, and his guild will not be able to do a single pull without him.
---
That is opt in. This one isn‘t.
---
Of course, because we know Blizzard are fucking dogshit trash at making fun and interesting games.
---
So we are worried they will fuck classic up beyond all repair.
---
thanks for keeping us updated

&gt; What they gotta worry about is the 48th battalion of pissed off ~~normal~~ *Redditors*
---
I'm afraid for your a lot of peoples mental health. This thread is amazing.
---
&gt;but the mob mentality on this one doesn't make the sub look very good tbh.
---
This sub have never looked good, it's a shitshow for the most part. Tips just so happen to be a bigger shitshow than this sub.
---
For Shaman leveling Enhance is recommended. It has the most throughput (front load damage, regen mana in the rest of the fight) where Elemental will have you drinking a *lot*. Resto has problems with killing stuff in any sort of a timely fashion. You can heal fine with all specs at low level (just save some gear). Shaman tanks were apparently a thing at low level in the beta, but I don't know how far that goes. At 40 some people recommend you switch to Elemental, making healing easier as they basically share gear and you can get the core caster talents lower in the tree.
---
Never did much pvp on a shammy, so I can't really comment.
---
Totems are fine. It's judging which totems will give the most benefits to the most party members with your group composition. Generally through the instance and in some specific fights (when you're up against elementals for instance). Those I bind to a totem bar. The "oh shit" totems such as Tremor or Grounding I bind separately. It can be a bit sub-optimal if you're new to an instance (as you'll be reacting) but once you know what's what in that instance you can predict which "oh shit" button will be needed and it becomes a smooth ride.
---
As a priest you can aoe farm DM just like a mage can. You can also solo mara princess runs, check out ooze spriest he has some great content on youtube for priests.
---
Most streamers are actually way worse than the average player, but most people dont notice since they always get boosted and showered in gear by their mindless drones
---
I was around back in the days and basically everyone was begging for xrealm bgs. AV was a rite of passage no exclusive pserver player can comprehend
---
&gt; why are you talking
---
The topic of conversation is "is he is a good guy", and anyone who blacklists those who gank him on a pvp server isn't a good guy. There is no way to prove someone sniped you, nothing is stopping him from abusing that power.
---
But why are you talking, other than to kiss the ass of someone you are meaningless to?
---
Yeah, I used to be in a guild with a kid that was that stereotypical hyperkinetic hunter. Hopped around constantly, burst into lolrandom-isms at odd times, that sorta thing.
---
But he never did anything toxic, and when it came time to raid he followed instructions, played his class well and didn't make excuses for when he fucked up or dump on people when they did. More than I can say for some of the "adults" I played with.
---
have you tried being rich as fuck?
---
I wish they would just give BR it’s own server and avoid any conflict. It’s so obvious.
---
Just IP ban them
---
You really cant go wrong with chicken and anything else. I think I'll be eating quite a lot of chicken and rice. But I always want a jar of assorted nuts with me as well as granola bars.

The login server that authenticates you and the realm server where you play are 2 different servers

who do you think will be carrying his ass the whole time?

Here's another info guide regarding bags:  [Bag Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAkhIArfOuk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1)
---
Also, any bag that you can buy from a vendor...it's almost always cheaper on the AH from other players.
---
Haven’t gotten around to it. I’ve heard great things though.
---
Combat dagger damage output is all about backstab. Backstabbing all the time while leveling is impossible.
---
you can get some pretty good evidence that someone is stream sniping. If they repeatedly gank you in different locations and continuously camp you then that's a good indicator. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rouchn6t1iE

---
Unironically the reason why we have Classic. Based.
---
P-servers had their faults... but at least they didn't have any of this layering/phasing nonsense. When you logged on the server, who &amp; what you saw is who &amp; what currently occupied the server. Didn't have to worry about other people (potential friends/enemies/names-to-remember) being on another layer. Orgrimmar was thriving with people running about doing their business, the world felt full and the community was amazing. 
---
By having such a low amount of servers, we're going to have massively populated realms- which is bad enough because when there is such a high population, nobody remembers each other and nobody stands out anymore. The layering on top of that (which is obviously necessary for such a high pop) splits the server community up even more. This isn't how vanilla was at all. It breaks the immersion, possibly ruins the economy and ruins one of the biggest aspects of vanilla wow that made it so great: The community.
---
Blizzard better have an ace up their sleeve to deal with the oncoming shit show... Though I remain doubtful, I hope they prove me wrong and end up eventually delivering servers exactly how they were in vanilla (What you see is what you get, community feeling, no sharding/layering/phasing).
---
It really is that bad. The ever so slight delay of trying to cast a spell that is still on GCD even though it visibly isn't is so triggering in PVP.
---
Ragnaros is Latin America not Brazilian
---
We are nowhere even CLOSE to the threat of ghost servers.
---
Didn't 100k people take part in the EU server stress test?  Those 100k are only the MOST hardcore players.  They probably represent 1/3 or less of the actual Classic playerbase.
---
In order to have dead servers (total population below 2,000) there would need to be 35-50 realms AT A MINIMUM.  Instead we have 2 English speaking PvP.
---
Dead realms are, in theory, a real consideration, but they have balanced things SO FAR in the other direction that it's like worrying about frostbite in the Sahara in July.  It is not a credible threat....
---
Does anyone have a working gatherer addon? It's one of the few addons i lack.
---
This is premium bait
---
It's incredible just how incompetent modern game developers are to their older counterparts
---
just get a contract from the dod
---
I responded to you, not him. You were the one making a statement which honestly shows lack of understanding of the class.
---
Holy Wrath does an average of 530 holy dmg from base skill alone (in contrast Swipe rank 5 of druid does 83 dmg up to three times per cast, you need to use it 3 times vs 3 targets to overcome Holy Wrath vs a single mob), and has a cast time of 2 seconds. Meaning more than a global cd, so you can effortlessly use exorcism in the end for more threat gain. (505-563 dmg at rank 6)
---
In Improved Rightous Fury buff you gain 135% more threat from holy type damaging skills. Meaning if you're pulling with the aid of an ally, as you should, you can easily get off a burst threat value around 2120 holy dmg, before weapon swing vs an undead/demon type foe. To completely ignore this aoe spell, like *you* did, shows more of your own lack of knowledge about the class. 
---
I do agree it doesn't belong in a short overview of the class, but I will also say that paladin is a class that unlocks its full potential vs specific enemy types.
---
Holy Wrath also has 1 minute cooldown, not 30 seconds. So it's more meant for medium-big pulls than doing a small pack.
---
The main thing is that on a RP realm kids on the spectrum jumping around and screaming profanities won’t be tolerated. And since RP is considered “nerdy and gay” which young players are scared of being called, the demographic is expected to be older and more mature!
---
I like Esfand and a lot of the streamers themselves. I  think  a majority of them are good people,  it's just their communities that  make the streamers look bad imo. Either way, all the drama that is  going on  is  just a part of classic and I did expect to see a lot of it, so this feels just like old times, lmao.
---
&gt;So Reddit, why you won't be playing on RP-PVP server?
---
because it's an rp server
---
Wouldn’t the peak be in cata if you’re going off sub numbers? That’s where the sub peak was anyway.
---
Not really a simple question, but considering 1-60 takes on average 240 hours, what would you say is the most enjoyable class to level (other than Hunter)?
---
I’m almost set on maining Priest, but how mind numbling is the rotation? Is variety (e.g. throwing in a couple of Flays) detrimental and is Pain + Wand literally the only way to go?
---
Other options for me would be Mage or Shammy.
---
Only problem with that is you won’t have any gear. Best is to accept quests and grind, hand them in if you finish them by level 5 otherwise just skip. Especially quests like the Peon quest in Durotar, which will take forever as they aren’t on dynamic respawn
---
Just open up a german dictionary and look for some longer words. This applies for all undead.
---
and my wife!
---
We have and they ignored us. They didn’t even make an EU Spanish realm
---
Seems pretty unlikely you guys would be on the RP-PvP realm too, yeah?
---
I'm feeling like that's been their plan all along tbh, I wouldn't put anything past nuBlizzard

From experience server mergers are bad. You do not welcome new servers with open arms. There is a tribal mentality to stick with your server and only group with the others if you have to. Also maybe you were a top 10 guild on the server and that was great for you now you are barely top 25. All the top guilds are different and you dont know anyone. It sucks 
---
A massive amount of people on the server is going to suck for sure but after a few months I think the cream will rise to top and if I am top 25 guild at least I know where I stand. I do wish there were a few more servers as East coast NA we are trying to choose the lesser evil but we are hyped. My guild will do what we have to do and have as much fun doing it. Also unless layer hopping it was said that you will see the same people while leveling because you always get put in the same layer when you log in.
---
Also [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWaB4PXCwFU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWaB4PXCwFU)
---
Yea like holysheisse
---
Its pretty easy to tell if someone is stream sniping you, obviously if someone ganks and camps you once thats not stream sniping. If someone repeatedly ganks you in different locations or if they are ruining a community event, then yeah they are stream sniping.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vP6GiFOsc0Y
---
You never understood layering from the start it seems then. It is per continent as far as they have told us but there will be multiple of each (kalimdor 1,2,3,4,5 etc) so if you are on kalimdor 1 you see people on kalimdor 1 but don't see people on kalimdor 2 despite them being right next to you if they were on your layer.  
---
When you cross continent you go into what ever layer is lacking player and if you log out of kalimdor 1 wait a second for someone to take your place you can log into one of the other layers. 
---
That's exactly how they explained it. It's the reason people have been mad since it's announcement.
---
Close it up boys we are done here.
---
I'd be impressed that my friends went to the effort of concocting a story.
---
A server is not like a school-yard, or a professional office environment (where you're liable to see the same recurring faces day-in, day-out). It's more akin to public transport (assuming you're a regular user)
---
+ You might see a face every day
---
+ You might see a face every other day
---
+ etc.
---
I personally catch multiple-forms of public transport on my commute and (depending on the time/connections) I may or may not see the 'regulars' as such. I don't know who they are, I don't have their contact details and I will recognise them if I see them and everyone generally has their quirks (e.g. taking a certain seat on a train/bus, getting on/off at certain stops).
---
If you actually added people to your friends list you'd guarantee that you'd always know (and be able to) play with them. If you don't have them on your friends it just brings me back to the original question. Apparently you to a world is fake (or otherwise too big) unless you're constantly crossing paths, even though everyone leads their own individual lives, has their own routines and schedules.
---
How many people do you still keep in contact with from
---
+ Your childhood
---
+ Your school years
---
+ Your working life
---
I'm fairly sure you don't feel the (real) world is fake because you haven't seen a childhood friend in years, but you would of course rejoice from meeting and catching up with them again. I know this is cliche, but the 'time-apart' allows you to form stories/tales that you can share with others. If you ran a low level instance a few times (e.g. Scarlet Monestary) and had a memorable time with someone (but didn't add them to friends, for whatever reason) you'd still likely remember that time spent together when you next catch-up, possible in Zul'Farrak. Even if you're on an alt-character (because you simply have more time to play) if you had a connection, a real connection you'd ask them if they remembered (your other character).
---
In Vanilla (without all the fancy mechanics) if I played a bunch with someone and then didn't see them again for months, only to stumble into them again it'd be a joyous reunion (that or I'd feel really sad that they didn't remember me, even though I didn't bother to friend them). It's not that this is impossible with layering, but it's fundamentally only a problem that exists if you don't add someone to your friends list. If you added everyone to your friends list (Note: There's a reason you have friends and 'favorites'), even if they were just acquaintances and you never chatted to them (they're on the list, just because) you wouldn't have any issues you're concerned about in regards to layering. I mean yes, your friends list would be massive and full of what are mostly strangers, but you wouldn't have the problem you're most concerned about.

You have to deal damage. Sheeping doesn't tag the mob, nor do any other non-damaging debuffs. Even damage-over-time effects don't tag the mob until their first tick.

On the other hand, once the mob is tagged, it remains so until combat ends.

I have played on many realms in EU, and when I found myself playing alone because my friends left back in 2012, i decided i wanted to join a high population pvp server with balanced population between factions, and after doing some research i found out that the server I was looking for was Defias Brotherhood-Eu... but it was RP-PVP not just PVP so i was a little worried... i decided to join anyway and honestly it was my best experience in wow. You dont have to rp all the time, if at all, the community was good, and i found a nice Guild to play WOD with... i honestly didnt see any downside, i played for about a year and i never did any roleplay unless i was playing drunk ( and i always play dwarf )
---
mate you underestimate the autism levels of that guy and his brainlet followers
---
dude can legit get away with not streaming for weeks and come back and still be around the top....
---
so i don't think him taking a month off streaming to go full tyrautistosaurus rex is gonna hurt him that much, dude's already set for life.
---
This is an incredibly ignorant stance which reeks of cultural erasure.
---
The fact of the matter is there are different cultures with precious and unique differences, and these differences are *real* and what make different peoples *diverse.*
---
Saying that "everyone is the same" is Euro-centric bigotry, claiming that "everyone is like us."
---
And of course there are positive and negative differences. For instance, many non-European countries have levels of hospitality that would be completely unthinkable to many Westerners, like genuinely offering bed to strangers, insisting on feeding anyone that steps through the door, traditionalized tea sharing, etc.
---
There are also differences in online decorum, communication, team building, etc.
---
To say "there is nothing different in the BR community, it's just a psychological trick that people imagine there is" is how most *baizuo* approach cultural, national, and racial differences and it amounts to nothing more than erasure and Euro-centric bigotry.
---
Go priest, you'll actually be respected and you can farm well enough as well.  Mages are a dime a dozen.

No way In Christ is that average Iv leveled a prot Warrior not even training two handlers  till cap and it was 11 days.
---
Skarm seems pretty chill and very knowledgeable.
---
Australia can have him though, fuck that kid.
---
This makes me wanna move to na and gank him until he has lost his motivation to login. I really hope there will be anti streamer guilds.
---
Mine didn't either until I launched the game in the stress test and it created the folder for me.  I think you have to launch the game first.
---
Oh, sweet summer child...
---
It's not fine if it occurs in live.   However it's also not the end of the fucking world like the circlejerk on this sub seems to think.

It will stay forever. Its actiblizzard, dont forget ingame shop after ph2.
---
So what?
---
 Personally i really think everyone is making too big a deal out of the steamer server thing. 
---
Layering is a thing to prevent extreme numbers from breaking servers. 
---
Realistically, most of the people who follow big streamers won't last more than a week, since they will get bored of stream sniping or whatever. 
---
The whole thing is just completely getting blown out of proportion.
---
if not losing my mind because a couple streamers won't tell me "immediately, right now, no last week would have been better" what server they are playing on makes me a cultist then so be it I personally don't care if I end up there or not. But keep thinking the horde of streamer haters in this subreddit aren't some form of cultist maniacs in their own right.
---
Says way more about you than it says about the pic
---
Personally I feel like retail suffers heavily from content bloat; there's a lot to do, but none of it matters. Almost everything is on a timer and you're urged to scurry around in a hurry to get everything done and rarely get a chance to breathe, which is the complete opposite to Classic. Hell I just spent 2 hours on the stress test farming linen so I could craft Lesser Magic Wands for me and others in need, and it was a rewarding experience because I never felt like I was wasting time doing something trivial instead of some "thing I need to do ASAP"
---
Stress *test* is still a *test*
---
So I should only play 1-2 hours a day so the mid game last longer? Don’t be silly
---
Vanquishers Sword from the quest "Bring the Light" in RFD. Pair it up with Sword of Serenity and you're sittin pretty for a good 10 levels.
---
This here is absolutely amazing. Great video!
---
It's basically going to be prudent to use chat sparingly overall, since right click report is automated. It's a very different cultural landscape (in-game and in IRL) than what it was in Vanilla WoW.
---
It needs to be done in retail.

People like Asmongold with 100.000 viewers watching Deadmines will be found in seconds by just asking /world where he is.
---
You really do not need to watch a stream of a popular streamer to find them instantaneously.
---
Thanks
---
You can put up all the demands you want ... they can also just not listen ... and you can just not give them your money ... and people who don't mind, will enjoy it without you.  Classic was never going to be perfect for everyone because "perfect" is different for everyone, it is close enough for me to have fun so that is what I intend to do.

Head to the mage discord. All the class discord have good info for launch.

Yes, because that's exactly what happened back in the day @ real vanilla launch.

I was on a server that had 3-4k queues at peak for a few weeks and they offered free transfers to a new realm and 3-4 guilds from each faction went to the new realm and the queues went away.

Is anyone getting You have been Disconnected Error wow 51900101 on the PTR?

Maybe look for like a quest completionist type addon. Im sure there will be one not sure of its existence for classic right now.

There's no Gameplay in this clip. What does him ranting have anything to do with playing with him?
---
please someone register his name before he can
---
Honestly what kind of fucking whiner does one have to be to get offended over mean words online, as long as they're not directly targeted at someone with the intent to be mean spirited it literally shouldn't matter. And even in that case I'd argue that the ignore button exists, however I do know the other side of the picture, I know a girl that takes online insults directed at her very seriously and starts crying.

look at the soda post in this reddit. its toxic dude, nothing else.

"That will go to waste" if you are dead set on having a specific name then it wont go to waste. Then again its just a name, if you want a better shot at getting a name then pay, if you don't care then don't pay, even if you do pay its not a guarantee you'll get your name anyways because someone might want that name and got it faster then you.
---
I don't know who is worse here, Soda or the asshats just enabling this manchilds behaviour.
---
if streamers are so insanely popular, how come they're not just raiding with their viewers?  If you have a thousand people dedicated so much they'd subscribe to you for money, surely you can field 40 players for a raid and grant you prime access to the loot?
---
no most people don't give a shit as long as you're healing
---
Thanks for being a reasonable down to earth dude Esfand.
---
Everyone keeps thinking that they know how many people are gonna play that game better than blizzard. 
---
It’s literally their job. I’m not saying they don’t make mistakes, but they certainly know better than any of us. So if they truly plan on removing layering, they’ll probably make that happen
---
Ty for telling me! Gonna delete my char as soon as he gets 60 and start over again
---
How much time does mailing takes ?
---
Sending message / gold to someone ? To my alts ?
---
Send items to someone ? To my alts ?  
---
Thanks !
---
Dude I think this thread is filled with Blizz employees or some volunteer blizz bootlickers. It's crazy
---
But what you say involves reading, thinking AND not clinging to predetermined views!
---
Yep, even the most casual guilds will laugh at you and you’ll never get a spot for anything.
---
I hate that guy. I'm not even playing wow classic but I still hate him. Much better channels out there.
---
Yes, probably. But then they can choose to allow free transfers to fresh servers similar to how they did back in vanilla. This is far more preferable to dead servers in phase 2, if that happened instead of continued popularity as you argue.
---
what kind of ping do you get to arugal? im thinking about arugal or taiwan servers

Thicc = thick in an attractive way

Even if people make a character on Herod before launch they will still have to wait in the queue so it won't make a difference

Thank god there is people like Richturpin.

I did try to get her into WoW, but it's just not her jam. She's all about the Switch, but doesn't game too often in any case. Her father and brother-in-law will both be playing though, so at least all the women will be able to complain together!
---
You don't know it's a bug.
---
Look at all the threads about how shitty layering in the beta was because you'd only ever see 5 people in ironforge and shit.  Everyone there circlejerking over how terrible this was and layering was the end of the world and blizz sucks blah blah blah.  
---
It was obvious to anyone with a brain that they were testing different layering cap limits at the time.
---
And guess what, a month later that's exactly what they said they were doing in an interview.
---
So how the fuck do you know this isn't just some other test?  In the stress test you could whisper people on different servers to you by putting "charname-servername" in your /w command.  That's clearly not going to be on live release either - so there's already evidence of things that are part of testing that are not going to be part of live.
---
But yeah by all means cry about it and circlejerk with other idiots here on this sub and get a nice pity party going on.  Why the fuck should blizzard care, they know you'll all be paying &amp; playing on launch anyway.
---
It will most likely be ok.  You will just have to have a creative name.
---
True but everyone I know that was coming back has said no die to layering. Could just be my group but we may see less of those long haul players even starting.
---
Payo is big oof.
---
We look forward to having you with us brother!
---
And kids don't forget kids
---
Wont happen, much like reading the entire post.
---
Sure, they can do whatever they want. But they cant really complain about being ganked/griefed when people specifically asks for a non-streamer Realm.
---
You certainly didn't get it
---
Also could be titled “why you want to avoid being alliance”
---
So dumb trade chat is only limited to their servers?   I have a surprise for you then when they open...that’s going to happen on every server, no matter who plays on it.
---
Servers in 2019 can handle surly more than twice the players in 2004.
---
Herod or Whitemane, pick one crazies lol.
---
The fact that he himself is not fulfilling his own requirements.
---
And people that do that kind of stuff do get blasted, you just don't notice it because they are just normal people. He's "famous" so of course it will get attention.
---
Don't use g2a
---
And we are at the mercy of out streaming overlords, waiting for them to bless us with the knowledge of which server they will claim for themselves...

What percentage of people would have to change names?  Not many, I reckon.

I'll be on my last semester of college, so I may fall into the energy drink trap eventually. I'll start looking into more sugar free drinks. I'm trying to put on weight in combination with working out so milk will probably be a good choice tbh.
---
&gt; but that's going to be a minority opinion
---
You okay bud?
---
And? No one should be getting death threats, but streamers are at least somewhat signing up for that and also being monetarily compensated for putting themselves in that position. Not so much for the people who will be targets of their toxic communities.
---
Didn't they announce servers that they definitely wont be joining? Just go play on those if you want to avoid them?
---
Or come to EU.
---
There is no cap on Characters that exist on a Realm. There's only a cap on Characters currently logged in on a Realm
---
I'm sorry but that's pure conjecture.
---
The player cap is clearly set to the correct value, however there is a bug teleporting players.
---
It has nothing to do with intended changes to the Classic experience. If so then   
---
1) We would have heard about it.   
---
2) The cap of players able to enter would be set to 5.
---
If you have **sourced** information to backup your claim then please link it.

---
some of the plants can kill you, Roos fight back and don't even think about getting wet, BUT.... at least we don't have bears.
---
Phase 2 will come after a few months when lots of people are already lvl 60!  Levelling from 0-60 and THEN finding yourself on an overloaded server is a catastrophe.  There's no two ways about it.
---
I don't think its insane to say 4,000,000 people try Classic in NA, so with a 20% retention rate you're looking at what 80,000 people? Assuming you split those exactly evenly across 11 realms you're looking at what 7,200 people per realm? That already puts them at over twice capacity. I think 2 more PvP realms for NA and 1 more for EU wouldn't hurt at all.
---
That weapon is so fucking good if you get it at 20 or 21.
---
Asking people where they are just to grief them is the same thing as sniping lol.
---
Oh there are plenty of little birches who play eve, and their tears are delicious :p
---
He comes across as super chill.
---
And verbose. Very verbose. 🤣♥️😂
---
Big fucking yikes from me dog.
---
It really just depends, the communities on Twitch can vary a lot. 
---
I've never gotten into WoW streamers though, the big ones all seem really obnoxious not gonna lie.
---
Given the lack of realms they're launching Classic with, I think that they're either intending to shard the fuck out of Classic early launch, or they're severely underestimating the amount of players that will be interested in Classic.
---
Kuukk3li,
---
If someone’s “work self” is a shit bag I can guarantee that person is not worth knowing.
---
I’ve watched a few of his streams and I’m struggling how anyone can say he’s intelligent?
---
i think anyone with a lick of common sense has already realized that classic will be pretty bad now that layering is in, if not then they're just lying to themselves.
---
Thats a big yikes from me dawg
---
Ah did not know that it was do good that it was still used by a fury. Still not used to the primary stats of old. Cheers

I don't know why people are down voting the trolls in this thread. Downvote the people answering them like OP says
---
Priests can also only learn their racial skills from their main cities I believe. For example, a night elf priest can't learn Starshards rank 2 at Ironforge even if they had Starshards rank 1.
---
Getting the community to self adjust will be tough as almost every competitive PvP player will roll horde
---
Didn't they have a duel tournament in caverns of time in the beta?
---
What? So you aren't allowed faction rivalry anymore?   
---
Streamsniping is considered unethical, because you can watch the enemy do stuff like stealthing, eating in stealth etc.
---
Asking where somebody is to go there and wPvP them to death is absolutely fine.
---
How do you know he hasn't?
---
First world problems...
---
So if your smart and don't buy every single non essential skill from the trainer and only buy items that absolutely necessary then you will easily have 100g by level 40 without taking into account professions but if you just sell every single Green/blue item on the auction house assuming it goes for more than shop sell price  also herbalism is fantastic for early money even to sell to shop keepers so take it slow and don't waste your money and you'll be fine.
---
Exactly. Which is not even opt out. It‘s definitely not “opt in”.
---
Holyboner
---
Might've been worse on nost, i mostly played nd (14k-15k release) and silver hand recently (10k) and they both were pretty good launches, quite impressive actually. The drawdistance wasnt too bad at all after the first day or two. Anyway its better than layering in my opinion.
---
Okay
---
Every tactic in football is known. A team wins every year. The team that wins next year is meaningless, its all been done and seen before.

Herod is a NA server mate.
---
how are they assblasted? literally just said they didn't like it and asked why some people use shitty slurs constantly

yeah the internet has a lot of shitty people, that doesn't mean you have to stick around them
---
Yeah it drops in there, a quest item
---
There was an error with the key provided in the link. I found another key and solved the wine-dependencies issue. Back on track and I guess it's best to continue the chat here. There may others who are interested to read, who may have similar problems.
---
Esfand seems like the chillest streamers out there compared to the others.  But take note, lots of these threads and posts with super salty anti-(streamer) are really working themselves into a shoot are just as annoying.  You just know some of these kids are just triggered because they got chat banned and can only vent here or other forums.  No, I'm not supporting or whiteknighting asmongold or others, I wish they'd have their own server dedicated to streaming but it is what it is
---
Yeah, sorry bout that :) was looking at the EU servers.
---
The tone is off, for sure.
---
Not sure if all the hate being spewed in this thread is justified. I just tend to take all streamer and their credibility with a grain of salt. I enjoyed his class deep-dives on YT.
---
Definitely wouldn't lie about having played back in 2004 if I were a streamer. But whatever, I kind of understand it.
---
Where is your dunce cap?
---
At least we aren't defrauding people and taxpayers.
---
Is it wrong that the only thing going through my mind is what the 'best' method to aoe-ing them all to death would be? Like a hit-squad of 10 stealth Rogues with Goblin Sapper Charges and simultaneously detonating? I mean (granted it has to be a PvP server) it shouldn't be that hard to co-ordinate a burst like that at 60 and if the player density remains the same the HK gain will be worth it.
---
+ Streamer always raids 'xyz' at 'time: 123' and takes route 'ABC'
---
+ 10 stealth Rogues (or Druids) lay in wait (or however many you need to guarantee a kill)
---
+ Sprint in, do the deed, enjoy the circle of corpses
---
The *one* thing that ret can do that a warrior can't (well, except for Auras) is offheal competently. You slap on that gross teal dress and mash flash of light when there are healing intensive fights (Majordomo, Chromaggus, etc) and you can DPS in the others. No one is saying that an equally good warrior and ret will do comparable DPS - warriors and magi blow every other class out of the water in terms of pure DPS for the entire expansion. Tough shit, you can't bring a raid with 20 warriors and 20 magi. The argument is that they *might* make up for it in flexibility.
---
Basically the same reason you bring 0/30/21 druids, except with off-tanking instead of DPS.
---
Being put in a different layer is like jumbling up what server everyone is on at random times. If you didn't put someone on your friends list you only have a small chance of talking to them again.
---
Happy birthday Esfand!  
---
If your raffles weren't rigged I'd call you a top bloke.

Good meme, Only bad part is all the fonc's saying marmite is better than vegemite... pull ya heads in.

You will not melee a mage to death before they kill you.
---
Showing screenshots from your perspective that you clearly took at that point with the chatlogs and an agenda in mind just shows that you're projecting man. You didn't see what I was seeing from my perspective, and you're clearly not even thinking about the big picture. It should be pretty obvious that I didn't care that much (as no one should) about an item that's going to disappear in 30 minutes and I would MUCH rather make someone's day if it did happen to mean that much to them by getting one of those (guaranteed drops off of every kill btw) for someone else. I didn't care for the first one, and then people were pointing out to me that tbh I should take one for the sake of testing it's interaction with Seal of Righteousness and the"cool" part of Thunderfury,  which is the proc I was going to test, unfortunately wasn't even working. Which I then reported as a bug.  
---
It's a decision so clearly not about me, I don't even see how someone could reasonably try and take what happened and twist it into something selfish. To take the item and then step aside in the middle of the end of beta event (that the people watching the stream want to see and it's way more interesting than me autoattacking a random dude) to attempt to test an item which likely will not be tested on a Paladin at all until WELL into Classic, isn't even remotely selfish. The selfish decision would've been to not care at all about testing and to stay there to keep doing the show.  
---
Also for the record, Alphy was a good player and a friend I made during the beta. He was an awesome dude and I would love to have him in my guild come Classic launch if he wants to join
---
There will eventually be addons popping up all over the place.
---
You should pick up a chat filter addon and rest easy.
---
streamers are stupid only millennials watch that crap
---
I really don't mind if they want to speak portugese or fuck around. I just don't want to be a part of it.

It's not their fault they don't have a Brazilian server. I'm not going to get in a tiffy because they 'have fun wrong'. But at the same time I'm going to stay the fuck away from Thanos. 
---
It's still a nice gesture I guess, but I've always had an uneasy feeling when people through 'blacklists' around so haphazardly.
---
It's only meeting list of the people that know they won't get it
---
But.. what if it's fake? You probably just insulted someone for something he hasn't said.
---
with the one exception being dwarf priests
---
I just imagined Crocodily Dundee saying it. 
---
It didn't make a lot more sense, but it was a good experience.
---
Okay, thanks for contribution but this does not actually answer the question.
---
The paw/wing quest being a precursor to unlock the other quests is sort of a bummer. I'll be leveling with a group of friends, so that quest will be a pain.
---
I'm masochistic enough to post things I know will get downvoted, I think it's clear there are issues with my mental state when I'm rational and yet self-harming.
---
I'm fine with cross realm BGs. Heck, I'd even be fine with 3.3-era cross-realm dungeons, provided that each player has to travel to the instance entrance and aren't just teleported instantly into the dungeon.
---
Classic has a *very* long path to becoming the retail trash that WoW is today. If anything we should be raising our pitchforks when they start pumping heavy amounts of catch up gear into the game out of guilt that "only 1% got to experience Naxxramas", dumbing down stat sheets, pruning abilities, removing spell ranks, shoehorning everyone into the latest raid, splitting raids into 4 difficulty levels, adding Warforging and Titanforging into the game, etc.
---
Classic was good because it felt like a RPG. WoW these days feels like a shitty single player game, where the multiplayer aspects are mostly a hindrance.
---
&gt;People not comprehending this facetiousness

That's why you get married and have a kid. Then you can just continue to disappoint your spouse and let her take care of the kid but #doesntmatterhadthex

I'm currently using [Real MobHealth](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24924-RealMobHealth.html#info). It's early stages and it records damage (so you need to kill a mob before you'll know how much health it has), but it might suit your needs.

Check out Richturpin chasing down streamers. All his four videos are excellent. Im sure there will be plenty of people who will stream snipe and hunt them down.

well all the spaniards and italians are going shazzrah
---
Me taking items without talking to other players/class leaders?? This isn't even remotely true we had sheets for everything in our guild and would have loot council meetings every week.
---
People like immersion in video games, you can name any workarounds like friending someone but the fact is layering breaks the immersion that people want from classic.
---
Don’t mind him^ he still posts on Bernie’s sub. 😂
---
Make sure you stick to the Streamer Server. We don't want to get Blacklisted for killing you in the world and you thinking you got sniped.
---
I didn't downvote you, but thinking you're in the minority for taking NE priests is a bit silly.
---
Being able to melee a mage and use your melee abilities will allow you to have an easier time to extend the distance afterwards thanks to that, so no you don’t really make sense tbh.
---

\*Only applies if your idea of fun is taking 8 months to get to 60 and doing MC and Ony PUGs at level cap.

I'm assuming it's not possible at the moment for player health? so for PvP
---
Every Addon has a .toc file in the addon folder. The name of the folder must correspond to the name of the .toc file. Probably the folder name is something like "LunaUnitFrames-classic" whereas the name is something like "LunaUnitFrames.toc". Go check that out, it might be the issue :)
---
I mean... another player still has to buy the token, and they farmed the the stuff to sell the mats etc. technically, I'm not really for a Bond/token system though
---
The achievement is made valuable by the number of people competing for it.
---
I'd like a statistic of WoW streamers' viewerbases actually being 11 lmao. That's just blatant bs. 11-16 year olds are a very tiny part of WoW's playerbase compared to 18-25 year olds.
---
Seriously.  Keep this shit over in LSF

HolyThex or Realthex

Thanks man, I appreciate it. :)

I'm sure some "special" Eve players could figure out their location purely by the way the system is set out.
---
You'll lose a spot to a dwarf priest in a pug raid sometimes. Other than that, not an issue: raids are usually short on healers.
---
Any word on what server streamers are gonna be at, so I can choose the other one?
---
Lmao it’s kind of hard to get 15 under 6 hours when you have millions of people spawn grabbing  NPCs
---
https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24934-NugEnergyClassic.html here you go.
---
I dont play shaman but from what I understand, elemental was in no way effective at end-game. You went resto for PvE and PvE or enhance with good gear for PvP.
---
What a sad little man.
---
I’ve never watched streamers. Seems like a waste of time. If I have time to watch some bull shit dude who overreacts like a 10 year old why don’t I just play a game myself, or read a book. Twitch still baffles me.
---
He wouldn't be able to communicate with Chinese as they usually don't speak english.
---
I'll never *ever* have an idea this good.
---
But at least I got to watch someone else have it.
---
Fuck em. 
---
\&gt; TFW Streamers may be a plague rather than a boon.
---
No shamans?
---
Elemental viable? What game are you playing? Elemental shammy ooms in 2 seconds.
---
Just because you don’t understand the reasoning behind the things that Blizzard does doesnt mean they are incompetent and you know better. But this is the internet and everyone is an expert and Blizzard will always be incompetent shits.
---
I dont want to aim for world first classic ban
---
Resto or enh. Enh to level, switch for 1g at 60 to resto.
---
Regardless of the pro/anti layering debate, it shouldn't be possible to be in a different layer to your group. Something has gone very wrong there.
---
Yeah I truly can’t stand him. I watched one of his streams and wanted to rip my eyes out. Guess I’ll just wait 1 day after launch since I’m in no rush to get to 60. I wanna take my time and enjoy all the good memories.
---
Thank you so much! Once again, great work and I really appreciate you linking it here!
---
They did say that but it's unlikely unless they release more servers depending on player drop off and if that's the case then why ruin the start of classic wow with layering at all?
---
Krol isn't something you aim to get for leveling, it's an ultra-expensive epic that people get for early raiding until they have an actual raid drop weapon to replace it with.
---
god, I can only hope that this streaming fad ends and all those streamers/influencers have to live off welfare (many do already lol)
---
ele shaman are very much viable in endgame pvp.
---
Seriously.
---
I'm so happy to play on my german server.
---
No people telling me "no hablo ingles", "je ne parle pas inglès", no nothing.
---
Just people I can talk to and no streamers. My perfect little world.
---
This is gold.
---
If you’re going ele you’re going to have a tough time finding a raid group. Most groups will tell you resto, or enhance if they really need a buff applying with the axe the name is slipping my mind rn
---
Oceanic servers will have next to no Streamers.
---
I dont know, thats not what literally everyone else says.
---
Sword of Omen, still more of a Warrior sword but it can still be good. From a SM quest.
---
Due to having a real life and a limited amount of free time to waste I wouldn't even care if I take that long. Not everyone can play 10 hours a day , so fun in this case is very subjective.
---
Not sure if I'm remembering this correctly but he also said edgemaster's handguards (a mail item) is good for rogues.
---
Lol man every hour there's something dumb and new to cry about
---
So they are going to launch more servers... Then why have layering at all? More servers was always the option people suggested.
---
Go rp-pvp then
---
Except that it's not (by virtue of the very thing I've explained above). For it to be immersion breaking (from a social perspective) because you don't see familiar face xyz would require you to actually know they are online. I'm not saying that layering is good, but to be able to fault layering as being a root cause for you not seeing 'random xyz' in the world you'd need to be able to establish some mechanism where you could know that 'random xyz' is actually in the world, just out of phase.
---
If someone can somehow explain how (short of people constantly going in/out of phase in front of your eyes) you would even be able to tell that you cannot see someone because of a layer, and cannot see someone because they're not online, and even if they phase out what do other people see when someone get 'summoned' by a Warlock, they simply disappear from the world.
---
If a problem doesn't exist unless you are the cause is it really a problem?
---
&gt;outside of the game
---
Well then
---
&gt; Not everyone can play 10 hours a day
---
You don't need to play 10 hours a day to get there before 8 months. This post didn't even need to be made, it's flamebait.
---
Theres to elixir of translation or whatever in vanilla anyways.
---
Ich spreche nicht Deutsch! :p
---
They will instead keep it on permanently and people will move back to private servers.
---
Fuck yeah torvesta
---
There are Chinese servers too
---
Windfury. Where axe fits in, I have no idea.
---
True. But its harder to coordinate 40 man. And during wod we saw how "easy" those tactics/mechanics were. People were wiping alot on the anniversary raid. And that was just molten core. Like i said unless you are in a highly skilled guild you're not going to blast through content. Even if damage tresholds are lower than most pservers.
---
Is there an addon that shows your HPM and DPM for spells when you hover them? Ideally for showing the most efficient spells/heals to use as you progress. 
---
(Healing per mana and damage per mana)
---
what's the point? it wont be fixed and any discussion will have blizz fanboys shitting everywhere.
---
If you are constantly asking where a streamer is just to grief its no different than sniping. If you happen to come across a streamer when you are playing then sure go for it kill them but there is a difference between faction rivalry and trying to grief 1 person because they are famous.
---
Ended up in a similar situation in Darkshore. 3 party group clearing a Naga cave, was pretty much empty. Then I got layered where my party members dissapeared and the cave was full of nagas. I relogged and the same situation. Saw another hunter on this new layer and left my group to group up with him

He means the outlaw saber.
---
Thank you guys!  I will check out that video!
---
You mean Golemagg, the general consensus is Gole is the unofficial non-english friendly server.
---
I know I'm gonna roll Alliance Warlock - but I can't settle on Human or Gnome yet. It's gonna be tough to make that decision. I like Humans because... humans. But I've never played a Gnome before. The only thing I dislike is the lower camera anchor for Gnomes - I find it a bit jarring after years of playing tall toons.
---
I had an Undead lock in Vanilla called Chomper. I never finished playing him. Life got away from me and now he is lost to time :( So I'd love to re-visit Warlock. I remember loving how much utility they had. You could be a one-man army and I could escape most situations. I can't wait!
---
What are you playing?
---
There’s an axe that debuted the boss and I can’t remember the name of it. You usually run two guys designated with it per run
---
I was around back in the days and basically everyone I ranked with said they hated it by the end of the first week. I even talked to regulars on the alliance side who had the longer queue (~20m) and they said the same. I played on a private server once with a 20-45m queue and it was the first time I had fun BG'ing since 1.12.
---
Point is, opinions differ, and to me cross-realm BG's are nothing short of a travesty. I acknowledge that servers with 1h+ queues needed a solution, but to me they should do a solution via pairing of realms with opposite faction balances, or at least groups of at most 3-4 servers, in order to minimize the effects while still solving the queue problem. The solution of 13+ servers in a single battlegroup like in vanilla, or just every freaking server like they did later on, is to me nothing short of the removal of battlegrounds from the game, as that is the degree that I care for them at that level of anonymity.
---
And no, Classic WoW's low server count on launch is not an argument against these anonymity/large battlegroup size problems, as it says nothing about how many servers there will be in phase 3.
---
I'm not sure, streaming is different to a normal job and many streamers adopt a persona. For example, I follow the Overwatch scene and if you have seen XQC on stream, he is extremely hyperactive, loud and somewhat toxic. However, pretty much every past team member has vouched for him being a calm and intelligent team member and shot caller and it is pretty clear that his stream persona is not how he acts in real life but an exaggerated version.
---
they're just testing, yea? 
---
guys dont worry about the store they're just testing it, guys stop being mad about tokens theyre just testing them. guys guys guys stop being angry about the lfd and lfr tool theyre just testing them.
---
They go oom too quickly to be in any sort of extended raid fight.
---
Dont care about races. Sure Some are better than others.. but this should not influence your choice
---
That's not what I said happened, it was the exact opposite. I personally lost out on loot to try and get pugs and other people in the raid. One of the discussions I specifically remember having with officers/class leaders was "Look, if we're going to bring pugs into our raids we absolutely HAVE to let them roll on loot vs our guild's loot council, because if we don't then what is the point of them even coming? If we don't pick up a few randoms, then we can't complete the content anyway and there's no loot for anyone." The very first item that I was up next for was the cloak off of Skeram, and people were telling me I should just take it and I said no, absolutely not. We're gonna roll. And we did and I barely lost the roll to some PUG rogue who was wearing blues, but that's the kind of sacrifices you have to make when you're trying to keep your guild going and I was willing to except that.  
---
Emptied the guild bank on consumes and stuff for members, raiders, pugs, whoever, to keep the guild going as lost as possible while the server was dying and my stream was banned (hard to recruit). It's absolutely a big accomplishment to go like 6-8 weeks (not raids) like that and progress all the way to C'thun while pugging nearly half an AQ40 raid.  
---
A lot of other guild leaders in that situation would (and did at that point in the server) said "Hey guys, ship's sinking. Everyone start looking for another guild" and then they keep the guild bank for themselves so they can get a jumpstart on whatever next guild they go to.
---
Most people say that ele is a good PvP spec.. in fact it's their best PvP spec. Enh is the one that is known for not being consistently good but being very fun.
---
We tried. Mods deleted and locked threads giving the "layering is fine"crowd more validation to continue to not think about the ways layering would not be fine.
---
How do you extract that from what he said wtf?
---
Oh it's strong alright.
---
It'll blow their balls back to Dalaran.
---
Aren’t all PvE servers just alliance servers?
---
Yup. I remember when I discovered him on YouTube randomly, and thinking: There's something fishy here. Where did this guy come from and why is he acting like some sort of established voice all of a sudden?
---
Thank fuck I live in Europe, and pretty much all of the big streamers in the NA region.
---
Wow. I had no idea. I was a fan of this guy because of all his videos with high profile class players and whatnot. But what a shit head he is.
---
Tl;dr This guy is angry he won't have the time to be in guilds that are competing for world first in classic
---
i heard shazz was.
---
Nightfall bot. Applying a magic debuff for all your casters,

Nightfall is what I’m thinking off

Not a single client, but like every client

Yup that was the name

TWENTY TA EOIGHT IN THA FUCKIN MORNIN'''''

This is the correct answer.

This caught me out today. Two dudes were killing hogger and wouldn't invite me, so I let hogger kill them and then finished hogger off (he was at 30%). The tag doesn't transfer over though, so they just came back ressed and looted the item.
---
* Rp server tend to have large faction unbalance
---
* Chat channel tends to be people RP'ing and people not RP'ing insulting each others
---
* Average level of RP is quite bad (prepare for cheap erotica and characters taken from other universe)
---
* Game is not made for RP (every character is a hero killing the same enemy week after week,)
---
Hey "sadly" ill roll alliance so need to get something going there otherwise i would ping you. :D Ill keep tabs on your progress. 
---
Do you have a server chosen yet?
---
I'm thinking of making the druid my alt as well maybe, since the rarity would let me gear up super fast
---
&gt;Good luck on your journeys
---
Thanks, you too.
---
&gt; If we wanted to PvP, we'd go to a PvP realm
---
But you did choose a pvp realm. Expecting everyone to know you're in-character before being engaged upon is kind of silly.
---
&gt; thereby proving my concerns to be more legitimate
---
This isn't how proof works.
---
So there are 2 wands you can get for sure in darkshore. Bashal’Aran gives you one that is worse than the lesser magic wand and other one I think for the red crystal which is better. However a lesser magic wand should pop up on the auction house for around 25 silver after about 24 hours.
---
Not sure tbh.
---
Whole milk if you're starting to lift - You need calories. I put on 50lbs over 13 months during my initial bulk. Add Olive oil to your milk/protein shakes as well, helps a ton.
---
The "protein waffles" sold in stores are also a decent quick meal, slather on peanut/almond butter for a high calorie/good macro meal.
---
I can't even begin to imagine why you commented this on my post about endgame pvp.
---
Never let anyone tell you otherwise, buddy.
---
Nah I thought the same re money - wasn’t instant, had to wait the full 1 hr for both
---
You have my Thex.
---
So are you going to make to 15 under 6 or is he kicking you out of his guild ?
---
 An hour, i believe. 
---
Can't remember when the instant mail for guildies thing came about.
---
I'll take the people. I wanted to be in for the long haul so what's waiting around for a couple hours or day or two whilst people disperse? 
---
Now with layering I can have my own instanced world but I miss out on all the fun people I could have hung with during those few days wait.
---
Absolutely.  
---
I don’t watch any streamers but if I see some name I recognise damn right I’ll be trying to gank them.   
---
Some of these twats are really way to self entitled.
---
ForsenCD
---
Yeah it was same account characters I was talking about.
---
You responded to a comment talking about end-game with a post about pvp. I can't even begin to imagine.
---
Is the the same guild advertising on pservers, demanding that you take a 3 week vacation for the launch?
---
Why are people so hell-bent on fucking steamers over? Just don't play in their servers.....
---
Leveling-wise, from what i have heard, until lvl 40 priests level on disc with wand spec. You shadow word: pain, shield yourself and wand them down, put a renew on yourself every now and then. Can heal dungeons too. On 40 once you can access Shadow form you respec into that and go from there. (I'm not a priest player, feel free to correct me, everyone)
---
He's literally never even played vanilla. Anyone who has can spot it right away just from watching his videos.
---
Yeah that seems like a good solution. I'll keep on the lookout for it!
---
Can't imagine him being any worse than soda ninja looting a bis item after losing the roll.
---
You get a 10% discount for reaching Honored, and another 10% discount for reaching 'Rank 3' in PvP.
---
That sounds pretty damn good. I'm not a fan of coffee myself but have been considering trying to get accustom to it as a better option. Oatmeal is a great idea for early mornings!
---
5 in spirit tap, 5 in wand specialization. From there Shadow, or if you want to get creative smite build. 
---
Mind blast/smite -&gt; shadow word: pain -&gt; power word: shield -&gt; wand until dead. 
---
You will have no downtime
---
I need help deciding between Orc or Undead warlock. I do like the Undead look/animations a bit better but I would also like that 25% chance to resist a stun since I am going to be on a PvP server. Thoughts?
---
Thank you for the tip about the AH.
---
So for casters it is all about the stats, daggers, swords, staffs, frying pans whatever has the best stats is what you use because it is the spells that do your damage not the weapons. Hunters it is similar with their melee weapons they want to get as much attack power from them so their ranged attack’s do more damage. 
---
I do not have a ton of experience with melee classes from vanilla but from what I recall rogues and warriors dual wield (warriors for PvE PvP they use 2h) swords, rogues daggers, warriors maces and axes too. Enhance, Feral, and Ret if you decide to play that use 2h maces, axes usually.
---
It was the case back in the days because most people wanted to RP humans or elves more than anything else. 
---
I can't see in the future but it's very likely to happen in my opinion.
---
We are 2 weeks from launch and it's a bug that has existed since the first implementation of layering. I don't see it getting fixed.
---
Literally in the title.
---
Soda and his cult of fanboys are such a crybabies when it comes to discussion about Classic, maybe even worse than Asmongold. Exactly as you said, when he's camping lowbies it's fine, but god forbid someone would actually corpse camp his ass. I know he thinks he's the celebrity, but there are legit people who don't know who he is and he's going to blacklist those people anyway, because they camped him on a fucking PvP server. That's actually ridiculous.
---
Until your 'paths' actually cross (whether in-game or real-world) there is no reason to believe it would have happened otherwise. It's like a guy who has a crush on a girl being hurt when she dates someone else when he hasn't taken any action to ask her out to begin with. You can have an infinite amount of 'what-ifs' but unless you actively have a mechanism that alerts you to a lost opportunity it's all hypothetical/speculation.
---
If you knew that you would never meet someone ever again (and you knew this before your interaction) would they skew how you interact with that person? If I met a stranger for the first time it's generally the social norms/pleasantries, but even if I knew I'd never cross-paths again it isn't like I'd be cold/abusive towards them.
---
If you were going to 'transfer' servers, would you suddenly start Ninja-loot everything the day/week before?
---
A single interaction with someone could be a meaningful interaction (fundamentally changing their entire outlook/perspective on life). An even that is only once-off isn't necessarily meaningless.
---
If the OP (or yourself) could explain the mechanism that would be 'in play' so that you'd realise an opportunity lost (as opposed to an opportunity that didn't exist in the first place) then I'd be totally on-board with hating on layering because of how it impacts social dynamics. It's not like there is some reference table with all characters who are online with tagged co-ordinates (i.e. similar to gps) that track their exact position within a zone, the closest you get is a 'friends list' but that already eliminates the underlying concern/problem.
---
&gt; at least we don't have bears.
---
Lies. You have the horrendous Drop Bears. True killers.

If you think the average wow streamer is a millionaire, I have some news for you...
---
I followed this https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20766306520
---
cleared it up for me and gave me a big fps increase.
---
Some of it you wont be able to do with amd but should help.
---
If he was that nice he wouldn't be holding the community hostage by refusing to name what server the streamers are going to.
---
His YouTube videos are pretty good. He’s been a mature advocate for vanilla, at least in that medium.
---
Now what his playing ability or in game personality is like I couldn’t say. Half of me is “holy shit what a power tripping edge lord”, and the other half of me is “yup, that’s what it takes to be server/world first.”
---
I did play. And ive never said bosses were harder mechanicwise. But its the same now as it is on retail. People arent going to blast through those raids. Its only the highly skilled guild that will do it np. The average guilds will still take multiple days to get through MC, and definitly not in the first weeks. Untill they completely outgear it, they won't clear it in 1 evening. During the anniversary event in WoD it was shown how good the average player handles the easy mechanics you're talking about. Everyone in this subreddit is acting like this game is the easiest game ever. But it never was, and it still isn't for the majority of players.
---
Ugh gross. 
---
Blizzard please remove.
---
So bug report it then ? what does bitching and whining about here solve?.
---
Maybe a dingo ate your word?
---
Neither did he
---
Ya show him whos boss!!!!
---
Does Shadowform lead to more Mind Flaying and less wanding then?
---
I think you don't understand Asmongold's humor - everything being so serious; organizing goofy activities and then commanding the raid through those activities like a drill sergeant, telling people how proud he is of them when they succeed. And people act as if he's some kind of blight on a server, yet he organizes events and activities that create gameplay - world PvP raids, exploration, goofy joke activities. I can see viewing it as a negative to have the chat channels frequently discussing the streamer, and a server feeling as if the streamer is the focal point, but in terms of his actual gameplay participation, Asmongold seems like a positive.
---
Yeah I have to agree, he seems chill and down to earth and fun to watch and game with from what I can tell.
---
My memories are a bit faded, and i did not play beta or stress test, but items arrive after 1 hour for sure. If you only send money, that might arrive instantly. Auction house purchases appear in your mailbox instantly, money from your sold auctions also arrive instantly. The recipient (your alt, guild mate, stranger) makes no difference.
---
It definitely should
---
Okay sure you can argue that football is what pvp is to wow. Yet Golf has existed for almost 600 years and still going strong. You dont even have robots in that game to spice things up.
---
Yep, and he's doing it while I am trying to get away from work related stuff. And he deserves to have more fun than us.
---
Another comment explained it in better detail, but the short of it is that tipsout is a scumbag irl. The ceo of his daddies construction company, he committed numerous frauds totalling in the many millions. When called to court he played the race card.

I think I heard in Vanilla it was an hour regardless. So I think they just recreated as it was but don’t quote me on it.
---
Uhm... Asmongold? Can’t even stand that guy even with the sound off

Hello, I'm the admin of the Herod, Faerlina, and Thalnos discords. I do have to defend myself from some of the allegations here. The reason why I started the discords was to prevent any group or individual from using it to their benefit. It would also be great to keep the racism that plagued private server communities out of the servers. I'm looking for moderators who reflect Blizzard's values to run and eventually become admins for the servers, as I'm not the type to enjoy running them long term.
---
A lot of the allegations stem from a particular user who might be targeting me because of Islamophobia. Either way, I believe that none of my personal politics should be involved. I'd appreciate it if you were to add our discords back, or atleast I'd like to reach out and chat. 
---
The discords in question:
---
Faerlina: discord.gg/3yWdGMa
---
Herod: discord.gg/qKEcrZN
---
Thalnos: discord.gg/swJ7dz9
---
Should be noted that once ZG releases, the Bloodvine Set requires tailoring 300 to complete. [Bloodvine Set](https://classicdb.ch/?itemset=421) is best in slot by that point.
---
Exactly.
---
If the game maintains a population that large by phase 2 or 3 I fully expect them to open extra servers and offer transfers. It's what every MMO does.
---
What you don't want is a ton of servers that will be empty after launch day hype. Wildstar made the fatal mistake of adding more servers during launch where servers were bursting, but in a few months they all became barren.
---
Is this the most Australian thread in existance?
---
And you can't remove that extra action bar on the right side.
---
MadSeason kinda reminds me of oldschool Hobbs with his style, so I really enjoy his stuff
---
If it had something to add to the discussion it might. As it is it's no better than a clickbait Youtube video. "Oh my god I almost died today"
---
Do you have a link for a working elvui by any chance? Can't find anything on tukui or elsewhere really
---
Hey, so when it's time to claim the names, what happens if you just random the character in order to claim it quicker and then want to remake it later?
---
Will you have a window where only you can use that name when you've recently deleted the character or is it up for grabs right after you delete it?
---
Also is the name immediately available or do you have to wait 24 hours or some other period of time after deleting the character?
---
This is a newer feature. 
---
Original vanilla was about an hour. 
---
However, I don't remember exactly when this was changed (it could have been before TBC or after, not sure).
---
Or if servers die in phase 2 they could enable free transfers to more active realms like they’ve always done 
---
Layering is retarded

Anyone who isn't a borderline psychotic narcissist retard looks like a decent human when compared to  Staysafetv/Asmongold/Soda

Feralheart is the upgraded Druid dungeon set. It’s half blues, half epics.

" you think you do but..."
---
What about the part of the Spanish community that would like to play on a PvP server?
---
Things can be based on metrics and still be wrong though. If you don’t measure everything you might have a confounding variable like different languages spoken or different gaming cultures. Also, why the blind faith when it was a huge fight just to get Classic in the first place. At a very fundamental level this is a business decision but Blizzard has very recently been shown to be wrong in their decision making in that realm as well.
---
TLDR: I'm not going to play and I'm going to try to convince you not to play too. 
---
Don't let the door hit you on the way out.

wox on wox, off my dude.

"Layering is fine" looks like shit to me :D

I think that was cata with the guild perks, one of them was instant mail between guildies.
---
Keep Harold streamer free!
---
Yeah, you just had to watch him pvp on the beta to realize that he's putting on a dog and pony show.
---
I hope people do respect and consider others who share their server in all regards and manners. Hopefully you can rest your mind and things work out. Best of luck man.
---
You haven't presented an argument, you just stated that there is a factor of ignorance and now claim that leads is unable to proceed. It doesn't. We should always be open, and if the mods want to address the accusations I'll listen, but I've looked this topic over in here now and had my own experiences with them. Biases are something to be wary of, but they shouldn't prevent you from having opinions.
---
I want to level ahead of the curve with my Warlock. I plan on playing 16+ hours/day and get 60 as fast as possible. I have my concerns about professions so I'm looking for opinions.
---
I think I'd have the most fun leveling with Engi and it would be quite useful for hard quests alone. How hard / time consuming would it be to level Engi while leveling (with Mining I suppose since I'd be ahead of the curve for mats) ?  
---
At 60, it Mining somewhat profitable? As a Warlock I feel I could go \[Robe of the Winter Night\] instead of \[Robe of the Void\] and avoid Tailoring.
---
"It's not fine to kill me because I'm famous but it's fine if I gather huge raid to grief other players"

Nailed it. Friends list fine, but not this.

They were fine fucking you over by taking the two realms the streamers said they weren’t rolling on
---
oh right I forgot you can't pvp in endgame.  once you hit 60 you totally just stop pvping I totally forgot dude Im so sorry.

Anyway mockery aside I was replying to a comment saying resto for pvp and enhance for pvp and saying eles are garbo (for both) plz read and use your brain instead drooling on reddit

Atleast soda will call out blizzard on their bullshit. Tips is just a shill who will blindly promote anything blizzard does.

and a beta *test* is still a *test*, and one which is explicitly for dealing with bugs and related issues (which stress tests are generally not) but that didn't mean that they solved all its bugs when it was around
---
This isnt exactly difficult expectations for a guild wanting to get WF rag
---
Make Activision pay for it !
---
Good thing these guys have many people willing to carry them through raids for said BoPs on a golden litter while they kick back and watch videos
---
As a European, 
---
heh
---
I will be! Yay Pagle.
---
I do not understand these « rules » about RP/PVP.
---
It’s fully RP to assume that elves/humans are ennemies with orcs and undead.
---
It seems even more a necessity to attack and kills the other faction in a RP environment, unless you manage to do a peaceful interaction with an ennemy.
---
To me, it seems that RP PVP is designed to even more world pvp.
---
I would just assume corpse farm would be bad mannered and so not suited for this type of server.
---
Game of thrones made it a household word
---
&gt;  I was replying to a comment saying resto for pvp and enhance for pvp and saying eles are garbo (for both)
---
&gt; I dont play shaman but from what I understand, elemental was in no way effective at end-game.
---
Who needs to use their brain again? End-game isn't pvp.
---
Oh god dammit. I really have to roll Druid again. There is no other way.
---
No idea, it's not up as yet. But, Australian residential internet is bad, depending on how we hit the server, outsiders could be better off.
---
The point of the legal process is to convict or acquit someone. The point of basic morale principles is to judge people by their actions and their character. What you're preaching might apply if the guy made an attempt to make amends, to be a better person, but that is not the case. As such he does not deserve this misguided pity of yours.
---
Yikes imagine starting in cata, feelsbad
---
Also what crafting professions do i use as a shammy?
---
I was not making the point that everyone loved it. But PvP was dead on Gorgonnash DE due to faction imbalance and queue times.
---
I don’t think this is a case of “opinions differ”. Instead, it is almost as if different realms had been in different situations or something.
---
just a copy paste of a comment i made 8 months ago explaining to someone why hes disliked, but damn this guy is slimy. My opinion of him Has only dropped since then.  
---
" 
---
Tips has always seemed lime he's just at it to make money. He very well might love vanilla, but I don't believe that's his reason for making videos. I can't provide links and timestamps, but I can remember the things that make me steer away from him.
---
Let's start with when he lost his job. A few months after he starts get getting a fan base he suddenly is jobless for the first time in his working life. Makes a depressed video about it claiming he will be making less videos if any for awhile. His fans flood it with comments about getting a patreon they will support him. A few days later he makes a video all smiles and taken aback about the idea because it had never crossed his mind, but if people really want him to he'll make one, and it's never mentioned again (to my knowledge atleast, I'll admit I stopped watching him soon after.)
---
Then there are the exclusive leaks he claimed to have gotten. Making videos about big announcements on his stream. He gets lots of people watching his twitch channel and slowly tells everyone over a few hours about a few of the 100% true leaks he's getting from a blizzard employee. And ends it with hinting that he knows even more but he'll have to think about if he'll leak them to his viewers next stream.
---
Any other time anyone has potential leaks he has flat out refused to believe they are credible and are just trolls looking for attention. Like that German guy on the eu forums who claimed to know an Activision employee that talked with blizzard employees. He said there's no way anyone from Activision would be talking with blizzard devs so they must be fake. I don't know about you but I can see a blizz dev knowing and talking to an Activision employee much easier than a blizzard employee giving leaks to a relatively new and small youtuber.
---
Now his actual content itself. As I said I stopped watching him after the job loss story but I still see clips and him on classicast. It's only been the last couple months that he seems to actually contribute anything to it. He usually just acted as an echo chamber yes man. An easy way to get black out drunk is to take a shot everytime he says something like "totally, absolutely, I completely agree", "I won't play classic if (insert current slight change) goes live, or just repeats what the previous person said in a slightly different way.
---
God damn now that I scroll up that was longer than I had thought it would be, and I'm sure it's going to seem like I'm just a hater. That wouldn't be true, I'm all for someone making content about something they enjoy even if they aren't 100% right about every little detail. Those are just the main reasons to some people that he comes across as someone just trying to make some patreon/twitch cash off of vanilla fans. And the main reasons I don't watch his videos anymore, and the odd time I do its just to get a grasp of the subject then I look elsewhere for info on it."
---
Shoot me a message when you are in Japan, we can do that.
---
Yeah, that's the joke they are making
---
He's always been abit of a pessimist ranting about how Blizzard is ruining WoW and how everything was perfect in TBC. But you could clearly tell that he was a decent guy just being pissed off because he didn't like what happened to something he's passionate about.
---
During the last years though he totally changed. I have no idea why but now all he does is spewing out garbage and conspiracy theories all over the place.
---
I feel sorry for him. Clearly his mental health is not in a good place and he need some professional help.
---
This is clearly only happening because its a stress test. But the anti-streamers are purposefully obtuse.
---
Why did this get removed? :)
---
He’s probably never had any form of physical contact with another person so I’m sure he’d be delighted
---
Alliance Warlock, nice. We need more of your type ❤️
---
Not really.  The reason you want to wand is because you want to front load all your damage so that you can enter the 5 second rule earlier.  Every caster class will be wanding a lot.
---
Esfand is a super cool guy and a great representative for classic WoW but by virtue of being a streamer he is cancer to the game and ruins it for the grown men that cry on this subreddit and must die
---
&gt; But you did choose a pvp realm. 
---
We did not choose a PvP realm, we chose an RPPvP realm. PvP elements are expected obviously, we all signed up for that. But it is _intended_ for RPPvP to be the dominant activity, not ordinary PvP. If we wanted to engage in ordinary PvP all the time, we'd go to a PvP realm. Not an RPPvP realm.
---
&gt;Expecting everyone to know you're in-character before being engaged upon is kind of silly.
---
It's extremely easy and was not an issue for us for years.
---
* Are they running around killing mob after mob, running NPC to NPC, chugging consumables and anything else that's more akin to playing the game as a 'player' rather than a 'character'?
---
If yes, that's Out of Character behavior. Engage at will.
---
* Are they walking place to place, talking to people using /s, /e or /y and stopping a ton to just do /s or /e? Are they behaving more similarly to an NPC or 'character' rather than a 'player'?
---
If yes, that's In Character behavior. You can still engage them in PvP combat, but it is polite to then leave them alone whether you win or lose. 
---
If in doubt, don't be a corpse camping git anyway.
---
Nobody cared if they got jumped once or twice, or even three times. It's when it was repeated, obvious attempts to disrupt roleplay that we got annoyed. And it was something that even GMs agreed with up until Wrath.
---
Without experiencing it yourself it is hard to describe but it is very blatant to me when someone is purposefully and maliciously attempting to disrupt RP or RPPvP. Big give aways being jumping around, dancing naked, no use of /s or /e at all (Even if we can't understand them it still suggests an attempt at roleplaying with others on their faction), a /spit macro dropped religiously on every kill, and repeated, unending corpse camping to the point where your plans for an RP or RPPvP event with a bunch of people have to be shelved for the night.
---
&gt;This isn't how proof works.
---
But it would tell me that the anti-RP attitude is indeed very much present. Which would be very disheartening to see after so much clamoring for an RPPvP server. They might as well have just asked for an extra PvP realm.
---
Gave a green robe to a mage, he was stoked. Made me feel good
---
I mean, not everyones a pro at the game. At least she wasn't "REEEEEEEE-ing" like some of the others when getting wrecked
---
the hate boner is strong. the guy makes videos about a video game that you are free to watch or not watch.
---
you are just part of the toxic outrage crowd that has to shit on everything that you don't like, even going so far as to dox someone and dredge up personal shit that happened in their past, COMPLETELY UNRELATED TO WHY YOU DIDN'T LIKE THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE, in order to justify your toxic hate boner for them.
---
And I hate using the overused word toxic, but honestly what you guys are doing is way past the bounds of normal human behavior.
---
soo... Steaks#0001 is a massive bundle of sticks. got it.
---
My biggest issue is having BfA regulars constantly hitting me up for mythical or raids. I expect a lot of guilt trips and resentment come aug 27th.
---
His comment seems to imply he is familiar with other discords, and his noting that the popularity contest is yet to be win could suggest he is still trying to gain popularity for his discord and does not want to be locked in to the current "master list".
---
It wasn't meant as an ominous comment at all, more a light hearted jab. So relax man.
---
Split up so you’re on different layers and then group up when you get past the bottleneck quests.
---
It's because Blizzard in 2019 is a chaotic mess and cannot be trusted.
---
Wrong class, needs to be rogue.
---
Stream man bad post 1 of 50 for the day
---
Oh its the community just because some dickhead streamers say it is? Fuck them and their braindead stans
---
So i hate Tipsout as much as the next guy, but the Verdan the Everling clip shows him getting crit for 405 dmg with 1 broken item. His max hp is like 563.
---
He got normal hit for 200 dmg before the crit. Healer was at 50% mana.
---
Unless the healer was spam healing him from the start of the fight he would probably have died anyway.
---
So while most digust with Tipsout is fine, this seems like reaching a bit.
---
Not sure if it matters since he will be with asmon and mccon, guilt by association.
---
How does highlighting issues with personal testimonials not add something to the discussion? That's close to the definition of adding something to the discussion.
---
Here's mine. I was running around Orgrimmar when somebody said in /y that they were giving away some enchant that I needed on top of the Org bank. Now as it happens, I am on top of the Org bank. But I don't see this guy. What gives? So I run around for about 60 seconds, looking around. He is still yelling. Where is this guy? Then it hits me: He's on another layer. And on another layer he was.
---
I was firmly pro-layering until the past two days.
---
DELETE THIS!!!!!
---
you must be the most casual shitter on the planet.  bye pleb
---
That’s why we should say fuck it and take over Herod. If they join, they join, but there will be a solid community of people against streamers at the very least.
---
80%? Dude, I love classic and hope it’s successful too but get a grip lmao
---
Who is that pimply chode, with the terrible haircut? Don't think i've ever seen him before.
---
Eh?
---
Tryharding can never be taken too far
---
Esfand and Asmon are pretty chill
---
These posts are irrelevant and unnecessary. 
---
With so few servers...you're going to be on one with a streamer. 
---
Accept it, get over it, be excellent to one another and party on dudes.
---
It wasn't instant before and the instant mail feature was later introduced in WoW expansions.
---
Honestly this entire conversation is pretty sad
---
Maybe detonate the improvised explosives via cellular?
---
that will NEVER work. sounds great in theory, good luck keeping track of everyone.
---
I fully support that
---
Wow, that brings me back to the old school CoD days, I was so invested in that scene 2011-2014.  Wings is a prime example of someone that would do this!!

Safe space™ since 2014.
---
Going to ignore most of the fluff in this post and respond to the subjectivity posed as objectivity:
---
&gt; We did not choose a PvP realm, we chose an RPPvP realm
---
Pvp is in there. It's a pvp realm.
---
&gt; It's extremely easy and was not an issue for us for years.
---
Not everyone will have played on the same server with the same ruleset as you and whoever "us" is.
---
&gt; But it would tell me that the anti-RP attitude is indeed very much present.
---
Slight validation of a persecution complex does not mean you're being persecuted.
---
“I didn’t just say it, I declared it”
---
For me, non PvP RP make no senses att all, all RP servers should be PVap. we are in world with faction war,  we have to kill the enemy on sight
---
well if you put it that way ....... yes
---
It’s not meant to be taken seriously....
---
i'm hyped! i'm a little worried it might end up being the server people go to as a "safe streamer-free PVP realm," whilst having no interest in RP... debating reserving a back-up name on the normal RP realm just in case hahah : ^)
---
Mate. They are speculating. Which is totally fine. They explain in detail why they think this would be a good change that nobody would mind. They draw comparisons to other changes. They think it makes the game strictly better.
---
You can agree or disagree with that no need to “I’m sorry but...” them.
---
They were not making a statement about the bug you described.
---
Be careful of oozepriest or oggom. These two were a power couple on pservers. Skarm seems like a decent human but oggom is a real piece of shit egomaniac.
---
nek minit gender pronouns now banned.
---
Are you retarded?

This is a hunter thing.
---
Rogues don’t have pets that look like quest mobs.

Go be a hero somewhere else.
---
I stick with the 144hz but I mainly keep it for first person shooters
---
Lol. You really think twitch would ban sodapoppin?
---
link?
---
Nope, i like my games played, not watched.
---
Anyone know if there is a classic bigwigs yet?
---
Say what? Soda is clearly acting as if streamsniping is against the TOS (it is not, never has been, never will), yet he does know it's not - hence the fucked up blacklist you can see him grin over like some gremlin in the current top post on this sub. He's completely out of touch with reality and actually believes it is his right as a streamer to be able to ban people - he stated that himself following the duel tournament.
---
Devouring Plague is a priest racial, so the main difference is Will of the Forsaken, not the extra DoT of Devouring Plague.
---
Not recognizing that there's more than one way to RP is disrespecting the culture, no? A ton of people RP in the fashion of "you're my racial enemy so you die."
---
How people are supposed to distinguish between the two on the fly is beyond me.
---
quicker they burn out on it, the quicker they and their shitty fanbases leave the game for the rest of us to enjoy.
---
Oh yeah, for sure, I don't mean to criticise her, it's just not really the kind of thing I enjoy seeing. Much more fun to watch the pr0s screeching than seeing someone who doesn't really know much about the game get embarrassed by someone who does.
---
It's 2019 you can probably just find him on discord.
---
t. Esfand
---
Soda is very wealthy. He could never stream again and live the rest of his life comfortably.
---
You're right. I will edit my comment. That makes me 25% more relieved haha
---
Woosh
---
Perfection indeed. I can \*almost\* see my home in that picture of IF. End of the bridge, left side, closest to the bank. Standing on it, jumping up and down, watching people stop to inspect my tier gear. The good ol' days.
---
lol frostmourne
---
Esfands cool. The other classicasters are at the very least a little controversial, but yeah, Esfand just seems like a really chill dude, the kind of dude you want as a friend and I've seen nothing to doubt that.
---
Also not how that is pronounced.
---
Nope. Nothing whooshed. You fucked up, own it and move on.
---
That’s Texas for you.
---
I’d rather not play WoW than play on a German server.
---
 I dont know if i can live in a world with such a big issue like this bug.
---
I'm removing and locking this post, at least for now, while I sort through comments. At least one has named IRL names of people which is against Reddit site-wide doxxing rules and the whole thing is turning into a streamer-focused shitpost instead of Classic-focused content. DM me if you have concerns or comments about this; I'm the only mod online right now and to be quite honest am trying to catch up with a massive backlog of moderation actions.
---
Oh, yeah these people do exist too naturally in every demographic. 
---
But I have had my fair share of chinese refusing to group, speaking english or enrich the server community on the latest pservers.
---
50%+ of the server not contributing to the community? Yeah, no. I'm out seeking greener pastures.
---
He's fine, but I think he's gotten a bit gimmicky and it often feels like he forces himself to be upbeat and talkative, I guess that's an effect of having thousands of viewers and making a job out of it.
---
I liked him better when he was a small time streamer, posting RP videos with Drakova (miss the guy BTW) on YT. I played for a while in Raid Three (though I never was a regular roster player or anything) and it was a really nice environment. I kinda stopped the private server think when they disbanded and merged with another guild. I wish I had a longer time with those guys.
---
200 ping though. 140 is rough as well but not nearly as bad. There is also a korean community on the NA server, so more then likely there will be one in classic as well (specially since more koreans will come because they lack a pvp server).
---
Also 2am to 6am seoul time is 10am to 2pm PST, very rare for guilds to raid at that time.
---
Thinking I confused hunter for rogue is a huge woosh. Everyone posting videos ganking lowbies back in the day was a rogue. Get help.
---
So they can raid and gear themselves
---
I prefer long queues to cross-realm BGs. That is how much I value realm discreteness. That feeling is unlikely to change.
---
Just be a fuckin skitz cunt an say it anyway
---
On private servers even human priests got bullied relentlessly. I can’t even imagine what a nelf priest will go through.
---
rl gank
---
Hopefully it's just people arsing about on something that deletes your character each time.  
---
People will be a bit more invested hopefully on full release to not act like a sperg lord.
---
Almost every Brit or Aussie i know uses that word.. Americans are just so uptight.. Im shocked we arent shitting diamonds 24.7..I see far worse in trade chat than that word. Carry on !
---
Tbh there's only very few streaming personalities people on this sub dislike. It's more the effect they have on the server (not necessarily their fault) that people dislike about them. I for one love Esfands content, but I just wouldn't want to play with him because of the weird social dynamics that revolve around streamers (their orbiters) in general.
---
where mu friends? where mu mates?
---
Considering BG's are not until phase 3 they are a long way from even explaining how it'll work with regards to cross realm groups so its pretty pointless to even think about considering we arent even on phase 1 yet.
---
I didn’t think you confused a hunter with a rogue you fucking pleb. You tried to be a hero when this is clearly a unique style of ganking only hunters can do. 
---
Not everybody posting videos “back in the day” of their lowbie killing exploits was a rogue. That is also irrelevant to the original post.
---
You need help.
---
The sad reality is that ppl have an unhealthy attachment to blizzard - fostered by their decade + long playtime on retail. It makes it so their sense of self is unhealthily influenced when you mention the company. Good things foster their ego, bad things is an attack on it. It's one of the things I'd like to research when i finish my psychology uni studies
---
I find its hard to actually care about the wellbeing of gankers, even if these streamers take it way too far to punish them.
---
Assholes fighting assholes.
---
source?
---
Thats why I quit before 8.2... Already out the door and ready for a "fresh" start in Classic. Just logged into the stress test and gutted my friends list of all the people I spoke to just for M+ and Raiding on retail
---
I play dead by daylight and there are a lot of streamers. Often I wont even know they are a streamer until the end of the game in the lobby, and they have TV or something in their name. 
---
So I'll go back and watch the replay of our match for fun, and nearly 100% of games I get called a stream sniper at some point in the game. Its always at the forefront of their minds, they all think their hot shit even with only a dozen viewers. Its ridiculous.
---
That’s it basically. You’ll use Thrash Blade till 60 and beyond.
---
Do you think there will be more people at the release of Classic than it was in BFA ?
---
&gt; I would just assume corpse farm would be bad mannered and so not suited for this type of server.
---
Exactly. Attacking is fine, even expected. The problem comes from excessive camping to the point of stopping others from roleplaying, or repeatedly attacking to make others break character.
---
Ya I can't wait for my semi-retail world PvP layering experience. Good job guys we're really teaching layer 4s redrodge mountain a lesson.
---
Does anyone want to go kill layer 7s thrall?
---
Or get real jobs and stop being a parasites on society.

I dont care if someone clears Molten Core by September 3rd. That just means someone took some vacation time and that was all they did.

The only frustrating thing about playing shaman is that it’s 2019 and people have the cognitive ability to kill your totems now, the minute you drop them.

Lol you dang Aussies! This thread triggered more automod flags than any thread I've ever seen.
---
Krol is bis till you get a raid weapon which can take weeks/months.
---
Cool for u
---
It does in retail.
---
Nobody cares what you think lmao.
---
Your point might be valid except anyone can /who HrvatskaMilan and see you're in &lt;Zone&gt; and what level.  Deductive reasoning can further lead to guesstimates as to where they are if you're familiar with the zone. A level 19 horde in Westfall probably means deadmines, isn't hard to deduce. No need to watch their fucking stream.
---
I mean, if you act like an massive dick streamers or not, other players will blacklist you.
---
How to avoid it? Don't be a massive cunt.
---
Nah you tried to prop yourself up and be a hero, at the OP’s expense and I can’t abide that, particularly when the content is good.
---
Go fuck yourself.
---
Goodnight.
---
Glad to have you Kiwis alongside!
---
I'm sorry I got you so cross. :(
---
Its a mixture of feelings. Some people just enjoy fucking over people on camera. Its the satisfaction of ganking except you get a live feed of the persons reaction.
---
Others, like me, will stand by and watch it happen. I dont care about streamers, but the shitty personalities of some really turn me off. And classic wow had been full of them. Only a few are genuine, wholesome people.
---
Oh look, I got banned from the Golemagg Discord while I was asleep.   
---
Own up to your mistakes dude it's your problem if you got exposed, it would have never happened if you have acted like a normal human being. Which isn't hard to begin with by the way.
---
From the video   -    It took about 4 minutes and 20 seconds to kill Van Cleef.
---
Yea, i would post it on bug report forums, but they seems closed for new threads now.
---
Hoped that it gets some upvotes here, so blizz maybe see it, but whatever. Bunch of trolls here better like some memes and streamer hate threads.
---
Don't underestimate the power of weaponized autism. If deathecus can have an angwe in their server culture we can have a bunch of anti streamer gankers in ours. All you need is a few rogues with sappers in a contested zone and you're good doesn't matter the numbers.
---
What has staysafe done?
---
Cloud Connected has to be mentioned here
---
And why should I care that you would be awestruck by someone finishing an old game quickly?
---
Ye thats a Good point 
---
Can imagine it being hard for GM to take a stance on
---
Don't you need lvl 5 for skinning?
---
Isn't "cunt" essentially the same as "dick"? I mean, they're gender associated, but they largely mean the same thing, do they not? Not seen anyone get banned for calling someone a dick. Pretty mild insult tbh. Think cunt should fall under the same category.
---
Of course, be nice, and don't call anyone anything unless its absolutely necessary.
---
Americans.
---
yeah...no, the problem people are seeing is that the amount of servers is not going to be enough to cover the demand, the 2 EU ones that were initially up were locked in 15 minutes because they were full (all layers), they opened a second set, both are sitting at high pop now, but it's a stress test, a lot of people won't even touch it because it will get wiped.
---
So, when launch day happens and they get a massive influx they WILL need more servers with all their layers.
---
They don't do it in character. Means they talk normal during the run.
---
It happens in retail all of the time.
---
I'm so confused as to what is so hard to understand about "we want classic WoW".
---
Sad that there are many healer classes, but only 1 true tank class. atleast paladins could be best in aoe tanking or close to as good as warriors in raid tanking. In vanilla though, seems pallies are only good at healing
---
Probably had a rough day AoE farming. I've had days where I have been able to farm multiple levels and others I've been online for 2+ hrs and only gotten a few blocks due to a ganker coming past every few pulls. 
---
Granted, I just suck it up and move if its getting to frequent. But I can see how he could get to that point

Who said that you should? Are you slow? Because that would explain a lot.

This would in no way stop what was happening in trade chat in the OP. This is a silly plan, and will end with lots of unhappy anti streamer people. 
---
Why would the streamers give a fuck what server you play on? It literally wont change their experience one bit. They ignore in game chat anyways.
---
Avoid the streamers or be unhappy. This autistic "fight back" nonsense will accomplish absolutely nothing.

Only in name, the actual functionality of having LUA that supports checking enemy units real time just won't exist.  
---
I could imagine something that sets a target name, /targets that name, and then /targetlasttarget instantly, but that would only be a slow update not a realtime one.
---
Commenting to track post.
---
I sat down with you, it was so cozy to be able to take a break from the questing, and talk about our time in vanilla, and so crazy we used to play on the same server. sharing stories about the server legends, never had a better time in this game. looking forward to playing with you on the 27.
---
Any PROOF to back up the CLAIM that it's INTENDED? Happening all the time != intentional.
---
BGs will be cross realm just like they were in Vanilla and even in the Classic Beta.
---
What's wrong with few servers? I thought the point of an mmo is to play with lots of people.
---
Oh man. Lots of information available out there. YouTube should have plenty of videos breaking this down.
---
Couple things off the top of my head:
---
Race is most important for priest as they have race specific spells. Look that up if you want to play priest.
---
Orc is generally a good choice for pvp due to extra stun resist
---
Dwarf have an ability called stoneform that removes bleeds and disease(?) 
---
Human gets extra spirit, rep and sword skill
---
Tauren have extra hp and a stun ability. Tauren also have a slightly larger melee range and hit box due to larger size
---
Demo shout will unstealth a rogue too and improved demo shout has a pretty large radius. It's good for pvp for that purpose.
---
good
---
And yet someone somewhere cares about Duke Nukem and Super Mario speed runs.
---
The only thing that's sad around here is you, go stand on a soapbox at a large local marathon and start telling people it's not important because it's the 934758th one .
---
The shear fact people have been arguing for months if a week one ragnaros kill is POSSIBLE or not means that it matters.
---
YOU THINK YOU DO BUT YOU DON'T
---
You just need 20 points in Holy, which you can easily spare.  There’s no need to respec...
---
What if the server gained conciousness and simply rebels against APES players?
---
I haven't run into any issues with layering myself.
---
That guy is also friends with all the streamers he ganks. It's a friendly rivalry that they like to taunt each other for. "Haha I beat you!" (many times off stream getting cleaned for bank at dueling arena)
---
For me, it's not even a matter of will they, but rather, can they drop layering after Phase 1?  Layering is based on the population, you can't throw a dart at the calendar and say that's when layering will end.  Layering CAN'T end until the population reaches a certain threshold and there is no way for Blizzard to know that date.  They are just guessing that enough people will have left by the end of Phase 1 for this to happen.  Enough people at Blizzard think the population will not only drop hard AF before BWL is even released; they also must believe that when BWL releases there still won't be enough people coming back to try it?
---
I don't buy it.  You can't put a release date on the end of layering.
---
RIP
---
Did you or did you not say "the entire classic community would be in shock"?
---
If i want to craft gear so i go skinning and LW? Or mining and bs?
---
I personally prefer Lutris simply because they do the work for you for multiple games.  It opens a lot of very easy doors to walk through.  Also, with Lutris you still have complete control, they just put you in front of the base working version to save time.  Everything you can do in Wine is inside the config options.  
---
Being said, there is absolutely no issues running it direct through wine/winestaging with DXVK etc.  One of the things I love about Linux is the ability to change everything.  
---
Just be sure to plug in Gamemode next time you install.  It's shocking how much of a difference it makes.
---
I imagine competing for mining nodes is going to be a challenge
---
It's a legacy server you have all the time in the world
---
Wouldn’t be surprising if he made a second account on the pserver, seeing as how it was free
---
Raids are so fucking easy that people will PUG and not be too far ( 3-4 weeks) behind. 
---
No way a blacklist works.
---
For the people who are saying that they should have more based off preliminary numbers. Bliz also fully expects a large number of people to quit mid leveling or to quit once 60. 
---
They absolutely may be incorrect, but I actually think they're doing this the right way.
---
The quest includes taming a pet(three actually) , Which is effectively your first one, since you can use it as a pet. But I don’t disagree that it’s a bit confusing.
---
Great to hear that we can go here in Classic. What about the Troll village hidden in north Darkshore? Below Ironforge and IF Airport? I'm so hyped.
---
Also the twitch app seems totally broken. If i click on discover or trying to launch a stream i get kicked to "Unable to load Twitch" and needs to reconnect. Doing that doesnt help at all.
---
This sounds like alot of fun, but I wonder, do people usually also pay attention to the meta part of wow, and actually clear raids and stuff, or is it really all about the story side of things.
---
Is misquoting people part of your disability?
---
how can you miss the point so hard?
---
Cringeee
---
Paying for a sub to save a name but a streamer ruining it the last second is already going to fuck people over. Trade chat is fucking aids but at least it’s sectioned. Choosing a least popular server will also be cancer because of foreign speakers. Most streamers won’t even stick to classic so having an already existing backbone that doesn’t give a fuck about them would help. It’s not necessarily fighting back but more of not letting them dictate how a realm operates.
---
Should have soulstoned the dad
---
Sounds like the words of a loser. Have fun hitting lvl 40 in December.

www reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cocwqt/staysafetv_is_fed_up_with_people_asking_him_to/
---
Also realize that the two servers they gave us was a West coast server and the unofficial Brazilian server.  East coast PvP players still don't know what realm to roll on to avoid streamers.
---
And sooo poorly itemized. Ret wants Str and stam and agi. Int is okay but not great and spirit, is like always, garbage.
---
&gt;Pvp is in there. It's a pvp realm.
---
RP is in there, it's an RP realm. PvP mechanics and gameplay are expected on an RPPvP realm but it should not be the dominant mindset. Full stop. The original realm rules even mentioned this but were erased around Wrath.
---
I've already gone over what the differences are in the OP and in some of my replies elsewhere. Feel free to read them. I think I've been pretty clear on what separates an RPPvP realm from a pure PvP realm.
---
&gt;Not everyone will have played on the same server with the same ruleset as you and whoever "us" is.
---
I am willing to concede that it took some time for the agreements to be organised, but after that it was pretty organic and it didn't take long for even new arrivals on the realm to catch on. Plenty of times a would be ganker would get a /shoo animation thrown their way and they'd get the idea, maybe drop a /sorry then move along.
---
&gt;Slight validation of a persecution complex does not mean you're being persecuted. You're already posting about a situation that hasn't happened and then complaining that it'll be downvoted before it's even going on. Get a grip.
---
I've removed the lines in question, as I'll admit I wasn't expecting any positive responses (Per above) at all. I concede, I'm just used to Reddit automatically shitting on the Roleplay community. More than once on the main sub I've had RP-related issues or discussions downvoted to hell and belittled or even mocked just for playing the game a certain way on servers intended to facilitate that style of play. Regardless of the content of the post.
---
i remember! so blessed we met like this. I have added you on [battle.net](https://battle.net) so we can play together at launch
---
What have gun laws to do with this man child? You hate America :)?
---
You're good man, we don't have all the facts. You, Venruki, and Madseason play fair and seem to be your authentic kind selves, so you 3 are all I'll watch. Don't change.
---
I mean, if that's the only difference I can deal with it, simply because you as a player can't change the animation behavior, but you can change the font.
---
You can be ele and still be a very effective healer. It is also the fastest killing solo pve spec, despite having the most downtime. Even with all the drinking included you kill stuff faster than any other spec. You really have to have a mage friend for water, it's the most mana intensive class/spec I've ever played.  
---
Resto is pretty awful to solo pve with. 30/0/21, like Zaibuf says.
---
Sounds like you're definitely not one of those people.
---
Demo shout has always been one of the most underestimated warrior abilities, and especially useful early on when you're fairly vulnerable. Using that 10 rage to cut down the fight by perhaps 1-2 seconds doesn't in any way compare to taking 25% less damage. People are all on board for using 20 rage on hamstring to cut damage by 40-50%, but somehow 10 rage to cut it by 25% is a waste.
---
As for Imp Demo Shout, if you're going Fury, yes. But mostly just because the alternatives are trash. The rage gain from both Booming Voice and Unbridled Wrath is very very minimal, while Imp Demo will make Demo Shout cut around a third of all physical damage.
---
This is solid. I did 1-10 in 3:45 the first time (Friday) and in 3:10 yesterday. I have trouble with efficiencies and backing at the right points once I get to bloodhoof. In general anytime I need to go to town I either hearth or pull a few wolves and let them eat me to spirit Rez. 
---
Level 8/9 I really lose efficiency. As a Druid it’s still a bit low to do the harpy feathers, but I start to run low on quests unless I haul over to the red rocks area. I just need to make that move earlier I think
---
Imagine missing your ony buff cuz of stupid shit like this :D
---
At a certain point I'd like to be more on a streamer server than with these people who just hate everything that isn't a straight time machine back to 2004. It has become very toxic and a very bad look for the community as a whole.
---
I’m confused. I thought dungeons were 5 people max. I played during vanilla. No one told me they were 10 people in those two years.
---
Mother of god
---
Just had a layering bug. Zoned into Undercity and I didn't see any players or NPCs. Logged out/back in and still couldn't see anything. Had to whisper someone to invite me to their group and NPCs and players started showing up.
---
Rp-PvP is the druid server. What do I mean by that? Well, it's a server that makes everything possible but has no clear focus on any type of play.
---
PvE: Mostly about End Game instanced PvP and PvE.
---
PvP: People who want to play the game and like the danger of being constantly flagged, faction wars etc.
---
Rp: All about roleplaying
---
RpPvP: It's a mix out everything. It's about progression and endgame, it's about faction wars and open world PvP and it's about Roleplaying. Rp-PvP is the only type of server that incorporates every playstyle. Depending on how you interpret it, this can be seen as awesome or very annoying.
---
Any ideas on how the A/H ratio would be on Shazzrah?   
---
I know this may hard to answer, but I haven't a clue on where to look  
---
Considering rolling as Alliance on Shazzrah :-)
---
Nice! Any idea if we can go under IF? IF airport? Special Darkshore troll village? Any other spots?
---
This kind of stuff happened in the past too. It was just harder to do. If someone gets upset enough about that situation to write down your name, log off, switch realms, make a new character, and whisper you, shouldn't that make it more satisfying?
---
I accepted you, I'm even more, excited than ever.

Thats a really good idea, I remember in Legion I used the addon *BadBoy* to remove spam.

Definitely not overreacting. To start there will be a few thousand basement dwellers following streamers around. Between all the big wow streamers alone. Never mind the streamers who will be in it for the views like lirik and those variety streamers. There horde will follow them and cause chaos. If you dont think this you are naive. Just watch  asmongolds stream and see how many people follow that dude around.
---
Mate they're not GMs, and they grossly overestimate their sway on the world (of Warcraft). Their "friends" on the opposite faction can't possibly control every guild, so all this is is them making far out threats because they're a bunch of entitled manchildren.
---
You can't blacklist someone from the economy because it's impossible to control the AH like that. You can stop trade chat trades either, or people inviting gankers to instance groups, because they don't have control of *everyone*. A sizable chunk of the playerbase isn't going to know or particularly care who these self-important chuckleheads are :)
---
&gt; RP is in there, it's an RP realm.
---
Never contested that. You're the one contested that it's pvp.

Thank you for admitting that it's a clique mentality and not the norm.

I can't speak for others, but while it's not my cup of tea I have no problems with them.
---
I watched on for a lil bit and he literally said streamers are gonna be on one server so just go play somewhere else. 
---
Why do streamers think they deserve their own server to play with friends? if they want a private little wow server then go make a pserver otherwise go fuck yourself  you don't own blizzard or classic wow so either deal with other people or don't stream simple.
---
or go attack with pet and have them out of range and when pet is about to die, just cancel eyes of beast so pet never dies
---
As a Swede im a bit jealous. We have a large community but not big enough, and instead get stuck, like the poles, making unofficial communities on EU servers.
---
Did they pre release all server names?
---
Which servers are streamers going on so I can avoid?
---
Are any of the bags BoP?
---
Pretty minor issue compared to the problems with layering...
---
I proclaim all servers in the name of non-streamers! 
---
For Classic!
---
Me too.  I’ve always wanted to do an RP server anyway, but my friends thought it was lame.  I only have one irl friend that is coming back for Classic.  He said he’s willing to give it a shot.
---
In the past you could laugh it off as it meant the other person was Paying for two subs + initial game fee. What a nerd right? Now literally anyone can have an alt ready to go on the opposite faction. Before it was a rare occurrence, of this doesn't get fixed it will become much more frequent.

Why are barely any of the addons I download for classic working? It seems most of them are totally broken.

Do we know from an official source what the names of the chinese realms are?
---
Download the addon *BadBoy* to blacklist phrases
---
&gt; It's still beyond me how someone who wants to ask for help writes in general chat in german.
---
1. Totally possible they might not be able to do so in another language. Or at least not in a way you would understand what they are talking about. The german localization is bad - really bad. Lots of places and names are changed or translated to be precise.
---
2. There were plenty of germans present. So they could be sure to get help anyway.
---
3. Even as someone who enjoys playing and in english in general Im happy we get our own server. Makes voicechat so much easier.
---
Or they're waiting for the inevitable exodus that always happens after the first month of an MMO and leaves the overprovisioned servers barren

Vanilla world firsts were far more impressive. Raiding was new, boss strategies had to be developed and people were still learning their classes. It’s a stretch to even call it a world first in classic when it really only comes down to who gets a raid group levelled the fastest.
---
Is that with any WAs imported or just a blank slate? I'd try deleting any traces of WA in the WTF directory etc. and try again with beta2. 
---
For reference I'm primarily using this one if you want to replicate my setup to try if that works.

All I know is the Spanish Coalition or whatever they called made this official statement that they've picked Pyrewood. I assume that means the majority will go there.
---
Those who wanna go pvp, they'll probably go Golemagg, that's the circling news about it + there was a twitter vote where Gole won by a large margin.
---
I think imho that you are wrong. An order carries **implicitly** a position of power over the guy being ordered.
---
And if you are not in such legal power position (like a cop for instance, or a boss), you can't give another one any order (advice is fine). And of course the second guy will probably ignore it.
---
Anyway we are discussing semantic and sintaxis, so there is no point continuing with this.
---
GL HF!
---
You are the nicest classic wow streamer with high views. Please ret all over tips out face if you are against him on the same server.
---
It's almost like they didnt invite enough people to the beta.....
---
Alliance only goldshire full.
---
Nobody gives a shit
---
Do you expect him to post the source code for the layering to poove that it's intended? How would you even prove that it's intended? Also even if it's not intended if this is how it works it does not really matter if they have not fixed it in over a year, why would they fix it in the last 2 weeks?

---
but that is YOU. Can you sit there and tell me joe casual who gets a couple hours a week to play wow will be willing to sit in Queue for 20-30 mins when his launch server is full when blizzard is offering him transfer to  a fresh server with no Q?
---
They had fixed this during the last stress test but it seems to be an issue again. I tried to message someone on the last stress test on another realm and got a message that I can't send messages to people on another realm., so this is probably just an oversight.
---
No but the large soul shard bag recipe is a rare drop and from my experience either you need a guildie to make it for you or you have to pay an absurd amount of gold for it. If you are in a guild with designated crafters and such then it is no big deal, you are a warlock, you summon us, you get big SS bag.
---
&gt; People are all on board for using 20 rage on hamstring to cut damage by 40-50%, but somehow 10 rage to cut it by 25% is a waste.
---
Different viewpoint: a mob running away and pulling a second causes more damage than the 25% resistance would save you.
---
Ah okay, ty for the info. I'll go shazz then.
---
I've had German tourists ask me for directions many times, in German of course, even tho they're visiting Norway. Strange.

Yes, having too many servers would be a problem, but cutting back from 89 to 11 is not even close being at risk of 'too many servers'.

Once I extracted the files for my addons the first time, I had to go into the extracted files to find the actual file, and then had to copy into my addon folder in Classic. Buddy and I got ours working this way.

Layering IS sharding, only it’s not cross realm, It’s amazing the whole community fell for this sick joke from the get go, it’s just sharding but a different name... and it will always annoy people and ruin the immersion and classic experience that people want, harsh truth.
---
What's your strat for killing Magmadar in quest greens with 1 tranq? Anybody who thinks about this whole process much can see that there are non-trivial aspects to it.
---
Getting Rag first will be world class by definition. If it isn't an impressive achievement then why did they get it and not you? It rewards coordination, optimization, planning and preparation in exactly the way that standard world first fare like heavy splitting does.
---
I agree that the other tiers might end up being contrived. A ton of guilds are likely to kill Nefarian within minutes of one-another after one-shotting everything. But Rag is different.

The flood is a real concern for me as well. My locked in plan is to go mage and at certain points when there are a fair few people on the stress test I find it really hard tag things and even if I go to a spot that generally gets overlooked there are other people who had the same idea. I considered a walking exploration route but it didn't feel good.  There's definitely a few quests that I'm considering just not doing like the boxes one(undead start) even with 2-5 people doing it alongside me made it a struggle.

Quality stuff man!
---
Basically, to combat servers being too overfilled and laggy everyone on the same server will be split into multiple instances per continent.
---
So once eastern kingdoms on a server hits x players, a new instance on that server opens up and puts players there so people can level and get mobs easier than having everyone in the same place 
---
It's temporary and will be removed when populations stabilize, and inviting a friend to your party puts them in your layer.

That's very true. While i enjoy paying with other scandis, i enjoy the mix a bit better, as long as everyone speaks the language.

Well, if i play with my guild, there is no problem i suppose.
---
Anyway this guy is a moron. I hope the worst to him, ganked ganked ganked!!!! :D
---
&gt; 20k? 50k?
---
At least 50k. Layering is effectively sharding since we'll be playing mostly amongst a new batch of strangers each time we log in. No memories. No fame. No infamy. At least not for 3+ months, though I'm pretty concerned that they're not actually going to turn layering off. 
---
 We missed the bus to the riot that might have convinced Blizzard not to do it. Your reasons are my reasons for hating it. Community was very often the primary thing that people said they missed about Vanilla and Blizzard has chosen to use a population management system that, at least for a while,  completely precludes.
---
I'll eat the downvotes on that one:
---
He basically explained what a black list was and said he'd love to have one. Black lists were incredibly common in Vanilla and a lot of people used them. Hence why people name "your reputation actually means something" still when they talk about things they enjoy about it.
---
Granted, stream sniping wasn't what got you on those lists, because it didn't exist back then. Used to be reserved for ninja-looters mostly.
---
Yea i think each layer is a server and Realm names are just a combination of multiple layers(servers). A new layer is created once the rest are full. Thats why when they released the stress test, my queue were at 3k, then suddenly went to 100 and logged me in.
---
Someone recommend a setup in [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cow2ic/addon_alternative_debuff_timer/) thread. Might be worth a try.
---
Lmao fuckem. If they want to guilt trip you for not autopiloting your +10 for the week, they're shitty. Especially when this xpac has shown you don't need to be as sweaty as previous expansions to raid mythic
---

True
---
Streamers don't have the upper hand if there is a guild dedicated to constantly PvP them.
---
You might say that "oh they can just call their viewers to protect them."
---
There's only so much people can do against a group of an invisible class.
---
Their goal is to just kill the streamer, then they won't care if they themselves die in the process too.

I don't think most of them could hold a job for too long.

elemental. 
---
All your heals are dependent on your gear, so take gear that says "increases healing from spells done by 70" and have two sets, because other pieces will say "increases damage and healing from spells done by 40", but the number will always be lower than a full on healer set, because healing is prioritized in vanilla. 
---
You can stay in elemental talent spec, no one will really know. The only thing you can get out of resto is the NS, and even that wont affect your healing that much imo, its 3 mins cd. You can heal just fine being elemental if you got the gear for it. The two go hand in hand, because they use the same stats, int and spirit. Def not worth the respec everytime you go raiding.
---
As much as I enjoy all the WoW community streamers, Esfand has been my favorite for sure! An all around scholar and gentleman.

You are very dumb. Theres more than enough players and OCE region has always punched far above its weight.
---
imo it is. 
---
But it might be a good localization and a bad translation at the same time. Changing names threw me off during the localization patches in vanilla. Switched to english client and never looked back.
---
I've installed them correctly but they just don't seem to function well.
---
For example, when I enable Bartender4 it moves my bars around but there's no way to bring up the config menu.
---
They didn't use voice and why would music matter. Stop trying to make up excuses.
---
Nothing wrong about this info. I said " Those who wanna go pvp, they'll *probably* go Golemagg" not " *certainly* go Golemagg". Also nobody expects all spaniards to go one server, obviously.
---
smh
---
I live in this, lol. I saw this on the news and sighed. Houston, home of having cougars for pets.
---
Assuming its on a toggle defaulting to classic models, how would this affect the experience for you?
---
Hm.
---
Haven't played with germans exclusively (apart from my close friends) in 15years, therefore I can't tell.
---
Will have to see how it goes. But not being able to communicate with a good chunk of your server population was quite aggravating for me personally when I played on the pserver with the 50%+ chinese.

He seems like a nice guy and definitely isn't openly wanting to ruin servers like a lot of big streamers are. My only issue with him is that he got popular by flooding multiple /world chats almost 24/7 on like 3 private servers for months.

sharding started in the legion pre-patch according to google iirc, when [b.net](https://b.net) first came out it wasn't cross realm. it was your server friends list, and then your real id/blizzard friends list. you couldn't just message/play with people from random servers.
---
I mean come on, who wants to play on a server like this: https://whc.unesco.org/uploads/thumbs/site_0734_0001-750-0-20090921180202.jpg pffffft

Mining is near impossible to level with your level.  Copper is fine, but there is frankly no way to get enough tin before you outlevel the zones in which tin drops.  This requires you to spend on the order of 3 hours backtracking for tin.  At server launch expect many people to be doing this, so maybe longer as it will be competitive.  
---
Engr is very useful and quite easy to level if you have leveled mining, but it still will take multiple hours just of crafting time.  There is no way it increases your leveling time enough to make it a net time profit.  
---
I highly suggest waiting until 40 or even 60 to backtrack and level mining while you are waiting for friends to do group content. 
---
Mining is typically profitable, but if you are power leveling on launch be aware that EVERYONE is cash strapped and anyone who really cares about professions has a gathering profession.  It is not uncommon for the first month or two of a private server for mining and herbalism mats to be selling at just above their vendor price.  
---
Minmaxing says get robe of the void, but I agree that the cost isn't really in line with how good of an upgrade it is.  I would probably sell my cloth for minimal profit to push the 60 mount as fast as humanly possible.  While most of mining mats have very little early value, arcane crystals are the exception as soon as lionheart helm recipe is found they will explode in price as literally every warrior on the server will need it.
---
And he literally said he'd use his connections with the alliance side to black list what a stream sniper was and bragged about how since they wouldn't get to raid, he would eventually have twice his gear. There was no lack of contex where he intended to only say "This is what a blacklist is". He literally said he'll blacklist people for stream sniping.
---
I'll be on Arugal as well. I'm torn between wanting it not being too busy early and not too quiet after a few months. I hope it works out.
---
Yeah, we had a guy in our guild learn that the hard way. He was a little undead warlock who died in Silverpine, and decided to run as a ghost to Elwynn to try and resurrect there.
---
If 50%+ of the server is not speaking English, then maybe is is you who are the minority and not enriching the server community by not speaking the language of the majority no?
---
enh got nerfed when they made WF not being able to proc off WF
---
Yeah, half their content in Classic is going to be them crying that they are getting streamsniped.  Bitch, you have a visible name above your character's model and the opposite faction has multiple channels to communicate on.  All it takes is one person recognizing you and calling out to /1 to form a raid party to camp your ass.  That's as much as people really think about you!  Narcissists thinking everyone everywhere is watching their streams by the minute.
---
If this is a thing that goes into classic I literally won’t be coming back to classic.
---
I don't see how that stands in contrast to anything I said?
---
I just find the whole idea of mythics and tiered difficulty to be such a designer cop out. Repeat the same content over and over with incremental difficulty as a treadmill. 
---
Later ontop of that randomized stats on weapons and they’re trying to turn it into diablo. Because it’s cheaper.
---
I hate you
---
Someone died to hogger.
---
Yep I understand them not working around battle net that would be unrealistic but this seems... Wrong
---
The only problem I see with a low number of realms is that Blizzard will not be able to keep their promise of removing layering.
---
Several posts like this are made daily and the same comments defending Blizzard are made whenever anybody criticizes layering, as if the BFA beta didn’t play out the same way Classic is right now and most of this community is just acting oblivious to it.
---
It’s over boys, hopefully a good private server can be made out of this new client without layering so we don’t have to pay for NuBlizzard’s version of Classic with all of its nuances.
---
If he were a rogue he wouldn't be able to kill people in Durotar like that. That's all I'm saying
---
Step on me Whitemane!
---
Why do you think that? Do you have a source for that?
---
You probably never played original vanilla and probably don't have a longing to have that experience again. I'm tired of the modern gaming world, I don't want it following me back to classic. I want to be immersed not hear kappapoggerz or huehuehuehuehuejajajajaj. We don't have enough servers. If you're wondering why this forum has became a shitshow, there ya go.
---
I spent 2 years hyped on this. I was here on these forums when they first started. I geared out a character on a private server just from the hype. I quit retail the day BFA prepatch came out. Many people just like me came to expect we would have somewhat of a pleasurable experience again. I know that if streamers infect the server I want to play on every weekend will be an experience catered to them and not the organic population being online and moving throughout the world... the population wont be the ones to drive the narrative on the weekends, they won't drive the server lore, the streamers would. Fuck that.
---
Some people have been playing this game for half their lives and to many of us, this is the last "expansion" we will ever play WoW again.
---
We don't want people who are just playing to monetize our experience fucking that up. Plain and simple.
---
Can't see why this would be so catastrophic for regular players?
---
He was talking about known "spergs" who only target streamers over and over and over and over just to watch their reactions on their second monitor.
---
Is repeatedly targeting streamers the only gameplay element in classic wow? Why are people so furious?
---
Idk, in my previous guilds we probably would’ve given it to him. He was the only one that needed it, and he just accidentally rolled early. We would’ve taken the early toll, and disregarded the second roll. 
---
Only annoying thing is him screaming like a child. I don’t mind that he actually got the loot since you can clearly see the other rogue with a warglaive.
---
Any form of auction addon.  They all have forms of scanning the market and displaying values when hovering your icon over them.
---
People were blacklisted if you were a shithead on the forums.
---
It's like they named their band just to write that song
---
As someone going shaman for the same reason, yes.
---
Auctioneer will, over time with a few auction house scans, give you an idea of what things will sell for to others. Initially the prices will be all over the place, and every server appears to value some things moreso than others, but after a month or so the picture should be a lot clearer.
---
This guy is fraudulent, he is directly associated with the OranThul guild.

They have been going into ALL of the Classic Discords (Class, Realm, Ect)

and spamming their Discord list.

Thank you, that seems to align with what I thought. From the complaints I thought it was a big issue. Thanks for explaining!!
---
Why not play both?
---
If you're getting into 'Classic' now there's no point in considering it a short term investment (it's something you join for the long haul). Leveling to 60 is just a 1 time cost (i.e. the leveling) after that you have a bunch of freedom, even if it is only for a change of pace.
---
Kungen didn’t use any voice till TBC.
---
Math isn't your strong suit is it? :p
---
800k not 80k, 72k per server.
---
Yes, you can level as resto. Your per mob times will be slower than enhance but probably equal to ele at least initially. That said, hybrids in vanilla are largely a matter of gear until late game. You can heal 5 mans with caster gear as enhance through to at least mid 50’s. Keep in mind that you’ll already be investing heavily in to resto as enhance anyway. 
---
Elemental has great potential but it doesn’t come in to play as a leveling spec, ime, until BC. The mana efficiency just isn’t there and largely your rotation is the same as enhance but you just front load more damage with lb. You need the time to melee a mob in order to regen mana for the next pull. So there is no benefit wrt leveling. 
---
You are best served by leveling as enhance and carrying two sets of gear imo. 
---
Building that gear set won’t be too much trouble as you can just grab any cloth, leather or eventually mail caster gear you come across. If you are healing you will probably have priority in a 5 man unless your group really sucks. I don’t recall ever having trouble getting sufficient gear when offering to heal. You don’t need great gear, greens are fine so long as you have enough water and you let the tank know when you need to drink.
---
If you don’t care about a slightly faster leveling process then by all means, don’t worry about it and pick what you like. It’s your toon after all.
---
jfc, it was a joke
---
His idea for the blacklist is to counter streamsnipers whose main goal is to gank him everywhere he goes. He loves the game and wants to experience it like a normal player. That's why he's also not streaming it for the first 2 months. You can imagine how much money and exposure he's going to miss out on just for the sake of playing the game without being surrounded by hundreds of shitters. It's no sinister plot to control the whole server like some people here make it out to be
---
It works. Saw a streamer set it up during stress test.
---
If World Buffs went off in IF instead of SW I would want to play Alliance a lot more, IF is such a better city than SW.

Nothing in the above video has anything to do with serious PVP. Rushing in 40man and then just spam AoE abilities is all about organization/communication and not related to skill at all.   
---
On a side note, its gonna be tricky to find realms, trying to avoid both streamers, italians, spaniards and these sad pants. Guess it's pick your poison time.
---
Damn.  
---
But thanks for the reply.   
---
I'll see if mouseover macro can work. It is not as handy, but if it works, it seems like the best option.
---
An interesting twist on kiting bosses to capital cities!
---
No way Blizzard allows them to take Grobb as their “streamer server”. Due to the fact there is only 1, this is the server type most requested to be added, and the backlash from the community if they tried this and were allowed would almost kill their streams and Blizzard at that point.
---
So basically if you want the safest server to be able to PvP without major streamers, play Grobb.
---
It has already gotten a good population of no/little RP to heavy RP guilds and the Discord community is already shaping up nicely
---
I'm loving this stresstest it's so much fun.
---
Ffs man
---
Should be allowed on all servers, along with every other word outside of a few obvious racist ones.
---
Being potentially banned for saying something like shit/fuck/cunt would be an absolute joke.
---
Delay rarely helps. Stream snipers have ways to easily go around it.
---
Basically back in the day this was used by other members of the team to be placeholders for unfinished art assets. 
---
So like if I was developing a forest area and he didnt have the trees ready in time it would just he a bunch of sam faces. Which he hated.
---
Yup - I rather them have fewer servers at launch and throw up 1-2 at a time as necessary than have 5-10 more than they need at launch and have ghost town servers.
---
I don’t think that Kungen is lying. You really did not need any comms in vanilla because the raids were so easy.
---
How on earth are people supposed to know that? What is your next question? If you will lose your character after the stresstest? Use brains.

i got my boyfriend into wow in anticipation of classic, he's hopped on the hype train even though i don't think he knows what to be hyped about. exciting times! :^ )

My mom cut the internet and knew little about computers so never realised I sign back up over the phone changing my birth year by a couple years to make it legal. Had all the hardware already. Had them send over a pre authorised sheet so I'd get bills by email and auto withdraw from my account. Missed a bunch of school racing home to check the mail. (2005) The one day I stayed longer at school it arrived. The amount of pissed she was and the confusion and the 2 months of Internet were all worth it

Its because he acts like a normal nerd that loves video games. He doesn't force it. You can tell who is faking it very easy.

Definitely one of my top 3 community peeps.
---
Sounds seriously rewarding doing this for 6 years, with all content beat. I cant even imagine why that would remain interesting?
---
Besides the bullshit layering, what major issues are you talking about?
---
The difference is how excessive is the ganking?
---
A few kills? Not an issue. But back in the day GMs would agree that constant, excessive ganking to the point of preventing people from carrying out their form of roleplay was considered griefing, and they acted accordingly.
---
The problems started when GMs stopped understanding us and just told us to suck it up and deal with it. Which caused massive anti-RP death squads and raids to start pushing us off the realms.
---
Alliance on Shazzrah is mine and about 25 other nordic pals as well. Hopefully it will work out :)
---
😂
---
Obviously I have no idea, but me and my group of 4 are rolling Alliance on Shazzrah. Was just a choice between the two server names and Golemagg sounds trash.
---
People who think they're more important or influential than they actually are.
---
yes and this time we aren't giving ANYTHING back no matter the circumstances
---
It wasnt like that in the beginning of WoW.
---
This is a looks good on paper, (cough sharding, cough flying), phenomena we're going through AGAIN, because we evidently didn't learn our lesson with the previously mentioned.
---
Layering in theory is truly riveting technology, it creates a system of "perfect population" always and it can be "dynamically" changed whenever needed.
---
Layering in reality:
---
Ruins the one thing people couldn't put their finger on that made vanilla special, one cohesive world. The world was the world of Warcraft, thrall was thrall, redridge was redridge, and that peacebloom on the road to orgrimmar was the peacebloom on the road to orgrimmar. Keep sitting their pretending killing layer 6 Thrall isn't going to feel meaningless. Or sitting in layer 4 Orgrimmar, and it "just kinda feels like no one is here", real cohesive. 
---
Creates an illusion of dynamic control.... Until the numbers don't go down the way you think they will. When that server is still at 20k - 30k by phase 2, what happens then? I'll tell you what happens, layering 2.0 happens (they'll call it something else so you all say thank you for keeping "layering 2.0". They'll invent layered continents and make world boss zones some kind of local sharding layering Frankenstein.
---
Allegedly mititgates the need for server transfers. Allegedly is better than having 5 Herods with shared naming conventions. What happens when Herod (because it's only 1 of 3 PvP East servers doesn't go down in size. They create new servers and bleed out your population because there's always someone that wants fresh. Or they allow transfers and your community fractures and erodes away. Please tell me how having 5 Herods with shared naming conventions is bad when it's literally guaranteed to require server transfers off. 
---
You see the thing is, retail got the way it did because Blizzard loves their numbers, and they're a business so that does need to be part of it, but they're clouded by them. They think they've got the "magic" figured out, but here we are with layering (that doesn't even function properly as of today). We're going down the same path, Blizzard strategically number crunching ideal server sizes with dynamic layering to ensure maximum server health. Tricking you into "name reservations" when it's really a demographic pulse test to see what's going on numbers wise.
---
The one fatal flaw? The masses coming back that have those 5-6 friends that laugh at pre enrollment stress test / name changes. The last time I posted this I had 10 other people tell me they're in the same boat and have friends that are off blizzards radar. Get ready for server transfers AND layering for the foreseeable future, it's going to be a wild ride.
---
Also he could always enable and disable pvp in a pve server right? So he can choose when he wants to fight people and when to quest in peace

Exactly.

That's why I'm going on a server on which everbody speaks my language, so everybody is happy. &lt;3

It's not so much everyone is a nazi, but more of a toxic environment that supported all kinds of shitty beliefs and politics. That's what Staysafe's discord was. Not everyone was a nazi, but there was a whole lot of literal nazi talks with no one saying "that's not cool".

---
But that's essentially the point.  The unwritten rules on RPPvP realms dictates that prior to any engagement, you take a step back and assess the situation before charging in.  
---
I think what the OP is saying is that the one-off attack/gank is accepted, but when people take it into the realm of camping/griefing, the RP aspect of RPPvP is not being respected.  RP events in WoW are organized events that take time and dedication to put together.  It is essentially a story being played and written by the players using their characters in the moment.  Uninterrupted immersion is important.  Realistically, it is also a lot of standing around and waiting for people to type out their actions and responses.
---
It seems to me that a lot of the sentiment I am seeing is people not actually understanding what these RP events actually are, and what they are disrupting if they take the PvP aspect one too many steps too far.  RPPvP is different from strict PvP server.  It **combines** two aspects to create a whole different dynamic that has to be respected by those playing on the server.  If you don't respect that, then you don't belong.  
---
I personally don't play on RP or RPPvP, but I've tried it and I respect their time and dedication, it's very fun.  I hope the GMs will have their backs this time around.
---
People are trying to avoid streamer servers so they aren't subjected to their hordes of fans iirc
---
Layering can suck it
---
Step 1. If you  are trying to get a name that people already use you play MMos wrong.
---
Step 2. Stop trying to steal streamer names, They most likely will get their names in the end regardless of what people think.
---
If there's 15-150 other people who use a name you use why bother?
---
if youre a tauren with 2+ yards and a hunter, your zone should be 0-7 for melee and 8-35 for range

Putting the French and British on same server never ends well haha

And I guess most of TBC was also easy because Nihilum started using teamspeak in Sunwell.

Sounds like democrats.

Probably the best private server guild, always cleared progression first
---
We can burn that bridge when we get to it. It's easier to be conservative, because shutting down a server and merging it is a lot harder than creating a new one and opening server transfers to it.
---
That's why they don't do it from the start. The need isn't there yet, and the need really might never be there.
---
VI VON ZULUL
---
Well, this is entirely untrue.
---
The issue is Soda isn't a mature person. He's the biggest crybaby when something doesn't perfectly go his way. 
---
His "stream sniper threshold" is going to be set at "got killed twice by the same guy", at best.
---
If the person doesn't use cross-faction translations to talk shit about him specifically, or he's sat in stealth in a remote place and gets ganked, there's no way to know for sure someone sniped him.
---
And my sword! (Which has a 5% chance to get an extra attack on the same target)
---
Nope, there is nothing on my minimap except time, name of area, sun/moon, and the +/-. Pretty sure the choosing what to track was only added in TBC
---
And as a follow-up question, are there any popular EU streamers to look out for?
---
&gt;  unwritten
---
Therein lies the problem. If it's not written is it truly a rule? From a morality standpoint I'm 100% with the OP, but as someone who sees there's more than one way to RP, I just can't agree with the rigidity of the stance.
---
what no thrall and jiana whouldent kill eachother read the lore=(

What? Blizzard wouldn't stop them at all you are dillusional. If Esfand and crew want to play on RPPV0 they have that right and blizzard would let them. People talk about streamer entitlement but fuck this is probably the dumbest thing I've read in a minute

Classic is a disaster... this shit should have been fixed a long time ago. It’s basically BFA with old data numbers
---
Can I come to the wedding ?
---
While I didn't sit at a fire for 11 hours (no hate from me of course!), I really enjoyed chatting with people about stories and what we were excited for while questing. I can't wait.
---
It actually does matter, because the player will feel and has felt the increased loads on the server. The servers are still under a CPU. CPUs still do have limitations.
---
Rogues technically land the first 'hit' in an engagement (via SAP) but they're not the initiator. Usually someone else with a cast time crowd-control (e.g. Mage using Polymorph) is the initiator.
---
+ Mage starts to cast Polymorph
---
+ Rogue needs to SAP before Polymorph lands.
---
The need to coordinate/time things is one of the things that made Vanilla special. Yes it's a little restrictive, but if your group couldn't pull off that tiny bit of coordination then you'd probably have bigger issues.
---
Show me videos of hunters meleeing mages to death while the mage is in their dead zone nuking them. I'll wait.

I will trade it for 2 NA PVP realms claimed by the big god ME.

If you don't have a plan for professions go herbalism and skinning. You'll get to gather/skin a lot while playing normally and it usually sells well.
---
I did that on my 2nd vanilla character and got the mount no problem. On my 1st char I was stupid and spent gold here and there and couldn't afford it for ages.

Okay? lol

He's a voice of reason, but I do sadly think he's being pulled around a bit too much by the bigger streamers.

He should be himself more. I hope he will do what he wants, and chase his own goals, rather then being a secretary for a bigger streamer.
---
Engr is a requirement at top end play.  Shadow reflector gives you a 2nd counter to fear, the netomatic is particular good on a druid, the helms give you hard CC on a class that otherwise has none, goblin jumper cables give you another rez(this alone should mean every druid rolls engr not just pvp), rocket boots combod with shape shifting feels like cheating, and yea you can't bomb in form but you can bomb in caster and since bombs are off global you can combo the bomb with a short cast like roots or regrowth and prevent a kick.

Alchy will make you like 5g a day via the transmute.  Level it on an alt if you really think the residual income is that important.

---
Guilds will do it a few weeks after launch, it wasnt uncommon back then to pay some gold to a guild, run MC with them while on farm status, get some loot, tell your friends all about it, etc. Nothing new. Time is money, friend.
---
So basically this amounts to, you can talk to total strangers across realms, but depending on how layers feel like acting that day, you might be phased out from your friends and not able to interact with them. lol
---
Indeed. One guy yelled he can't wait to make troll druid and chaos was ready.
---
Yeah people are talking so much out of their asses it's not even funny at this point
---
Cant fault the stress test personally
---
If only streaming did not generate money, there would much less of it.
---
The issue with most players is that because there are so few servers that if one or more big streamers decide to play in one server, the economy, loot progression and overall gameplay experience may suffer. A good example are minions of asmongold who follow him anywhere and do anything for him.
---
This coupled with a few of HC pvp guilds might break your dreams of achieving a high pvp ranking, for example.
---
What is max lvelv for stress test?
---
Don’t play the game then...
---
This is hilarious, I can't believe you fell for this.
---
I believe you log in to the client, as if you were going to play. Select a realm, and create a character.
---
Only you will not be able to then 'Enter World'.
---
Atleast that's the assumption of 99.99% everyone.
---
Blizzard can make a layer as big or small as they want. Day 1, they will be very small. Day 30, they will be fairly big.
---
Thanks to americans, all of their SJW and Anti-SJW bullshit.
---
But isn't that only until about level 20-25 and then everyone runs the same areas anyway?
---
I just hope there are no influential german streamers going tu ruin the only pvp server we have
---
damn you guys are being really degenerate. just dont play on streamer servers, we get it already.
---
Why would you think that? The game isn't designed for it, and we are going back to vanilla. You think they would make radical changes to core game design without telling anyone just because?
---
Carried? Well, except for the Korean and the Japanese, I don't consider any nationality to be above average in gaming, so no.

But the spanish-speaking part of South America get in our nerves just like we Brazilian get in American's nerves.

C-Engineer?
---
Absolutely true, mostly just relevant for humanoids though.
---
That's so fucking sad that these losers have nothing better to do. I completely get watching a stream and donating if you like it and being active in chat. But to follow them around in game and shower them with gifts and protection is pathetic
---
because goldshire and stormwind
---
Sounds like you need to grow up and mature a bit lol
---
I'd like to thank blizzard for doing all the work on the non layering stuff so now someone can make an accurate private server without blizzard's bullshit

---
Makes sense for a pve server why go rogue if u don't want pvp
---
Wait until they try streaming their raids and are stupid enough to start the stream before they even leave the city.  It's going to be funny af to see them rage about losing all their buffs because they were stupid and/or narcissistic enough to broadcast their location all the way there.
---
This shit makes me laugh. So "Spain" got together a congregation of players and decided? How did they manage to leave their welfare flats and afford to meet up, or did they use Teams and have a conference call?
---
How does this system work? Are there representatives that are elected? And are they by county/region level and report to a national position?
---
It sounds like a handful of twats and losers whom want to be passive aggressive about the fact they'll speak Spanish and Portuguese on an English server and therefore people shouldn't be upset about it when it happens.
---
Say what you want, no one cares about your plans (as if...). You speak wrongly, you'll get told. Deal with it.
---
Rules are contingent upon enforcement. As OP laments, with GMs no longer enforcing tempered PvP this social rule has gone the way of the dodo in retail.
---
Or you are severely overestimating. I hope classic is huge, but it's really pretty difficult to tell and there will definitely be some retail tourist that are gone in a week or 2.
---
&gt; the general consensu
---
where's that based on? serious question, as I still dont know which realm to select
---
For me the dealbreaker will be to find a guild that lets me roll for ret gear
---
Hahhahahhahahahha
---
Welcome to the gank.
---
how do you check your ping in that case?
---
I'd like to see what ms I can look forward to trying to play with EU mates
---
17 days out of 17 days seems like a lot. 17 days out of 12 years is very little :)
---
What did tips do?
---
We can still develop relationships. We are just a little more responsible for taking the initiative.
---
One of the first things I said was " We don't have enough servers. If you're wondering why this forum has became a shitshow, there ya go."
---
You're on EU, you don't have to deal with what we have to deal with. We have already seen other games get ruined by this by the same people. See: Streamers like Asmongold doing the very same thing in Cyrodill on Elder Scrolls Online. We already know what is going to happen. We've fought against the laggy deathballs for 7 hours and don't want to do it again.
---
Yes, it's Blizzard's fault for not adding enough servers but the streamers are also being selfish by delaying when they will announce what realm they are playing on while also vaguely alluding to taking the most hyped/naturally popular server name for themselves. It was a bad move. Nothing they are doing is going to help them reserve their names or gain a few levels gank free, and it served no reason other than to stir up the player base and make us "wait" for them before deciding our next moves to set up our guilds/plans.
---
It's not gatekeeping, I want everyone to enjoy classic. I just want them to enjoy classic like it was meant to be enjoyed. This game wasn't designed for streaming and I know it's 2019, but we must have some sort of compromise.
---
This is an important issue.
---
The apologist shill is right on time...
---
"it's beta, layering obviously isn't working properly, stop complaining about it"
---
 "it's only the stress test 1, layering obviously isn't working properly, stop complaining about it"
---
"it's only the stress test 2, layering obviously isn't working properly, stop complaining about it"
---
"it's only the stress test 3, layering obviously isn't working properly, stop complaining about it"
---
Andddss classic is out in 2 weeks and it's broken. Good job team
---
Yes, of course. Use this key instead of the one in the wine dependencies link: https://www.dropbox.com/s/4sdfexfvpp1qx9x/Release.key?dl=0
---
Also, here's another video for you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sjG2VNaW4c&amp;feature=youtu.be
---
I got it running by clicking "Play" now, but still gamemode is inactive.
---
A major appeal of classic is the insulated server community. Cross realm is the complete antithesis of this ideal.
---
It's crazy. Half of them are just foaming at the mouth over the smallest things. No wonder streamers look at this place and think it's such a joke and treated accordingly.
---
1.1-1.11 didnt have it. Only one patch did, so advocating against it is hardly advocating change.
---
...it's a reference to an Eminem song, 'Just Do It'

---
Oops I mean girl,
---
Girl, girl, girl,
---
Girl you know you're my world
---
SHHHH. Bliz might be listening...
---
I assume you reported it though? Did they get back to you, admit it doesn't work or anything?
---
I really would like to know if that is working as they intended or it bugged out unintentionally...
---
Except if you're rp'ing in the Warcraft Universe killing the same person over and over again doesn't make sense, you're taking advantage of a necessary game mechanic and using 'rp' as your shield. No character in any of the lore has ever camped a corpse for an entire afternoon (or whatever)
---
I just tested with my [level 5](https://i.imgur.com/UhHyTxw.jpg) hunter, Find Herbs shows up and typing "/cast Find Herbs" works fine too. I made a [new character](https://i.imgur.com/UhHyTxw.jpghttps://i.imgur.com/QeomcFG.jpg) and got the same results as you so either there's a restriction we're forgetting or it's bugged. Try leveling to 5 and see if it appears in your spellbook?
---
Ye ye, I know, i just feel it stupid and pointless. I can see the reasons for giving Russians their own servers for there aways seems to be major language barriers. But any other is a commodity that is just likely to piss off the other 50% of the player base.
---
It's the auction gazebo.
---
You could do that in vanilla
---
Omg this is the most cancerous post ever. Mod please lock that shit people are starting to get vile over video games again
---
Just because streamers play on the server doesn't mean that streamers run the entire thing.  
---
Whatever server streamers choose is going to be extremely highly populated regardless if those people watch streamers or not.  It's impossible to control that many people that don't give a shit about you with "blacklists".
---
That is unfortunate.
---
OK, if THIS was the thing he thought we didn't want, he's smarter than I thought.
---
jokes on us, you were only pretending to be a retard
---
It’s pretty simple imo, how much time do you have to spend raiding? Plenty of time? Warrior. Little to none? Rogue. 
---
Warriors are a lot of fun but you need the gear. Rogues don’t have that same issue anywhere near the extent that warriors do.
---
I hope they all roll on different servers just so that I can sit back and watch you people throw your temper tantrums about the big bad streamers
---
On top of the hype of a new expac after Legion's success (especially post WoD), BfA also had inflated sales because people noticed you could get character boosts cheaper by buying extra copies of BfA.
---
Makes it difficult to know how many unique sales there actually were.  Still, it's unlikely that Classic will ever compete financially with Retail.  The sheer number of subscriptions needed to match the profits from the store are just infeasible.
---
Serious philosophical question for you: would you act like a shit bag during work hours to make the huge amount of money he does? I’m willing to bet you have to spend some time thinking about that instead of just saying no.
---
Cant be worse then Live Warmode.
---
i guess this can work if all you wanna do is pve tank, but pretty bad for all around purposes like OP wanted.
---
Pretty much
---
No. Nothing wrong with having a life.
---
As a brazilian, I support you very much... If a brazilian movie is dubbed into murican english you would only hear "beeps"... Porra do caralho!
---
What do you think an acceptable level of faction imbalance is for a server? What is the experiential impact of faction imbalance?
---
What’s your problem with Eastern Europeans??
---
It's less about pvp'ing, he actually likes open world pvp. he just doesn't want to get ganked nonstop by streamsnipers who do nothing else but that.
---
Opposite faction made deals back then too, some guilds let eachother take turns on worldbosses for example.
---
Based on the data in the server demographic survey (stickied post), it's pretty balanced. Alliance: 44,69%, Horde: 55,28%
---
It had been several seasons since I've been back there, but that is mostly due to my euro friends more or less quitting in Season 3 or so.
---
I will feel the same as soon as they announce that layering “worked so well we’re keeping it for all phases”
---
bestfren*
---
Especially with the news media and their coverage of events.
---
Imagine if blizz trolls and we can play
---
Well if you're gonna be an ass then you deal with the consequences. No one is forcing them to gank him all day or to even play on his server. That's why I can't get what all the fuss is about. If you care about not being blacklisted then just chill and play the game, don't go out if your way to harass him
---
&gt;It's still beyond me how someone who wants to ask for help writes in general chat in german.
---
Regardless of general education, a lot of germans are unable to speak english beyond "hello friends" level.  It's also beyond me, I work in tech and even there people can't speak/read english fluently...

---
I'm not saying that you can't. But that's something special you have to find people for. Most of the time if you feel like doing a dungeon you're more interested in doing some PvE than RP. That said, that doesn't mean that you can't be in the mood for both. It's just difficult to ever find 4 more people who wants to do both PvE and RP at the same time, unless you're in a RP guild and play with them. That's what my experience have been like atleast.
---
Classic is exactly this, sitting by a fire and a guy questing sits next to you and then runs away. This isn't WOD
---
Isnt that the only similarity?
---
I know, that's not what I'm asking about.
---
Blizzard should ban All the streamers. Back in the day WoW got Huge without streamers we Don’t want a server full of fanboys. Streamers think they make the rules...
---
*laughs in BR... HUEAHUEBRBR*
---
Back to WOD then
---
I take it Whitemane is Mummy then?
---
I suggest we ignore your idea and petition blizzard make a massive change to the layering system.  As the current system is totally destroying the entire concept and spirit of vanilla wow.
---
1) After selecting a server you select your layer.
---
2) After selecting your layer you CANNOT get moved to another layer unless you select that layer.
---
3) If you decide to change layers you cannot change layers again for 72 hours.
---
4) If a layer gets too low on population it goes into 'bleed off mode'  after players log out they need to choose a different layer when they log in.  This does not trigger their 72 hour cooldown.  When there are less than 100 players left on the layer all players get booted off in 24 hours.
---
&gt;'but what if my friends are on layer 2 and  I want to join but cant because its full'  
---
false argument.  Blizzard is already making this decision for you with their automated layering system.  If a layer is full they system wont add you to that layer.
---
Tag their mobs.
---
Steal their nodes.
---
Bring the opposite faction to them.
---
Asmon for instance says thats one of the things he misses from vanilla, yet he will still slap himself like someone with extreme autism and go on a vendetta against anyone that does those things to them.
---
oh god. this is better than expected.
---
You are taking what is happening in stress tests and betas and applying it to what might happen at launch. You are overreacting.
---
I would love to know the region breakdown of those who took time off. I feel the US side couldn't possibly be the majority.... Right?
---
I never heard anyone call it VC in vanilla ever.
---
Thats amazing, I like stories like this. I missed the stress test but the servers are still up and am playing on it, I am enjoying running around chatting and slowly questing and buffing those players I see.
---
obvious trolling
---
"Paying for a sub to save a name but a streamer ruining it the last second is already going to fuck people over. "
---
Its two weeks worth of sub time. That's $7.50. Even in the worst case scenario, I don't see losing the equivalent of lunch at McDonald's as being "fucked over". Life would have to be really fucking peachy for that to be so significant.
---
Nope, easy just make it so that only solo player get forced to switch layer and not party members. Takes away the biggest part of the problem in an instant.
---
Where the fuck did you get a 22 armour cloak at level 5!?
---
y rnt the scandinavians tolerable? They seem calm people
---
Got a discord with a good chunck or Brits to confirm this?
---
OP also heavily edited his original post to make it look more like he's lamenting retail and less about how shitty it's going to be in the future.
---
Did you not read it? A language barrier. You wont be able to communicate
---
I'm probably wrong.. but allot of the clips from the Beta don't concern me. It's one thing when max level is Y and nothing more to do. Why not go join in a huge event with a streamer?
---
At launch, if you follow a streamer you are either going to be left behind as they level. Or you'll be just competing with him for the same resources. 
---
At 60? Fine do whatever you want... Again following them around means you're not progressing content or merely competing for same resources as them.. but most of the player base won't even hit 60.. If I recall, wasn't it some super tiny percentage of players even hit 60 in Vanilla? 
---
Besides that.. a streamer holding some event in IF or Org.. what harm does it cause?
---
I don't watch any of them, but I just think the time investment into classic is so high I can't imagine many people doing that *plus* causing riots on behalf of streamers....
---
Fairly interested in what issues that seems to have sparked so many tears, tbh
---
Don't understand the racism. You form your own groups in classic unlike retail. I don't see language ever being a significant barrier for classic.
---
How small brained do you have to be to actually believe that they could do that? How many good players do you think there are that actually care about streamer blacklists. Having raided in a guild with a whole bunch of streamers, and done sales with people who raided in asmongolds/sodas etc. guild, I can tell you every single person in that guild would laugh at you if you took a blacklist like that seriously. The only people who will actually follow through with blacklisting someone because mr streamer said to are brain dead and not worth playing with anyway
---
Calm down, Telstra.
---
I think he means that he wants to play only with people willing to speak English.

Whitemane will be the premier pvp server. 
---
We we will be the top dog pvp server worldwide, just like in OG vanilla. West coast secretly has all the most skilled pvpers :)
---
The discussion is basically to try and avoid the streamer crowds. Often the streamers themselves arent all that bad, but their large group of idiot fans is. These people are usually fucking idiots and contribute only headache to the classic community.
---
You start as a nobody and, if you are active socially, in PvP, or in PvE, you can develop a reputation and relationships. That was the secret sauce of Classic. That's entirely gone with layering.
---
I heard Herod will be anti streamer, Thalnos will be a lot of non English speakers, and rumors state Whitemane would be the streamer's choice.

Just curious what add-ons you're using here? I wanna be an elite mob too. Lol
---
The experience of progression that you worked for and earned is far superior to loot that is spit at you vending machine style.  That cloak upgrade is tangible.  And you may have that cloak for another 5 or 10 levels.  The experience in classic is what those who played seek.  Cant wait!
---
Yea, cross faction, not cross realm. Although even way back cross faction trading was possible at the BootyBay AH. 
---
And with the advent of tokens, sending gold cross realm is a thing now anyways, although with a huge loss.

They actually stated in a blue post that it will be in the streamers hands to put a delay to stop stream snipers and that they will not do anything if they are willing broadcasting their location. I’ll edit and link it if I can find it but it was posted on reddit.

I would be very careful, your reputations are getting tarnished before you even start the game.
---
The answer is that this classic release is just a way to milk more money from the WoW cow while cutting costs as much as possible.
---
Cheers cunt, ill be here till smoko
---
I wonder where are you getting this from. Like literally every private server ever made used to be slightly in favor for alliance and I dont see any reason, why it should suddenly be any different
---
Carbonite working?
---
lol, stop taking everything so seriously dude... you ain't helping
---
2 English PvP servers for Europe. Blizzard needs layering so bad at this point. 
---
Everyone was fine with the 1-10 zone solution. That was what they said first. Then it was like 1-20. Now it's everywhere, but only in phase one. Next time it'll be just phase 2 as well.
---
Just fucking remove it, release more servers, and let us sit in a queue. I don't care at this point. Walking into Orgrimmar in layer 16 and seeing it be empty is the saddest fucking thing i can think of.
---
What's this based on?
---
Game
---
I dont have a source just from what I heard from guildies etc.... I think it's all rumour shit.
---
Struck the nerve, perfect. Have a good one shill apologist.
---
It's hard to say how long it will take the game to become stagnant it that really depends on your goals with the game. If you want to just hit 60 and be done, then 3 months easy. But if you got hardcore raiding/pvp then easily longer. I'm going RPPVP and one of the amazing things about that is RP is essentially player made content. During WoD or even BFA while most servers take the population hit, RP servers tend to have people still playing and overall avoid the dead server issues. I'd wager these servers will remain alive the longest simply because the content there is always new in a way.
---
New player, can someone explain this? Why did you need him to attack you
---
I'm sorry to see my question upset you so greatly; could've simply chosen to disregard it but owell :)

Can't wait for soda and asmon to go on this server

Exquisite.
---
Most top guilds like Apes are going on Golemagg. Horde will avoid that server like the plague.
---
Strafing allows you to move away at full speed while still technically facing your target.  As a tank if you need to move quickly, back-peddling (using the S key) is too slow, and letting mobs hit your back is a no-no. As long as you are using strafe [to move away and around your enemies,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=566dm9FGiIo) they will never be hitting your back.  As a DPS, stafe allows you to squeeze in more damage while avoiding mechanics or while running away from other players.
---
While strafing, your character [appears to be pushing its shoulder forward at an angle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hWawnPJteo). You can move in any direction if you combine strafe with your right-mouse-button. The default keybinds for strafe are Q &amp; E, but my personal preference is to use A &amp; D. (You don't need A &amp; D to turn if you use your mouse.) 
---
It is pretty obvious when a player is keyboard-turning or back-peddling because [the animation is much slower](https://youtu.be/96Cyl9CwP40?t=247). 
---
Finally, the **daze mechanic** is intended to prevent players from carelessly running past large groups of mobs. A player can only be dazed from behind and within melee range of the attacking mob. This is most common when running away from it, but it can also happen while standing still if the mob approaches from behind. Strafing through mobs completely negates the risk. 
---
The daze effect in PvP can only be applied through abilities (concussive shot, avenger's shield, piercing howl, etc.), not from meleeing your target from behind. Player dazes do not dismount others the same way creature daze does, nor is the daze effect immune to skills/items that remove movement impairements or harmful spell effects. The main reason you want to face your enemy in PvP is to avoid positional abilities (e.g. back-stab) or, as mentioned above, to damage them while moving away.
---
&gt; But then they can choose to allow free transfers to fresh servers similar to how they did back in vanilla. 
---
How is it better to roll on a dead server and having to transfer to another server where your original name is already taken? Layers are the exact same as more servers just that they are easier to merge and avoid the renaming issue entirely.
---
That's mostly because technology has made them lazy.
---
I almost forgot about this feature.  I think I will keep the instant quest text off so I actually read and enjoy the stories.  From what I've heard Blizzard put quite a bit of effort into the quest text.
---
After the hype dies down I don't think they'll be surrounded all the time. There were countless times in beta where they got sniped
---
It means you can do that on the stress test and beta, it doesn't mean you'll be able to do it on live.
---
Right on brother
---
If I cast thorns on a tank, does the tank get the aggro from the damage it deals or me? It's been a while.
---
What a child
---
They issue that people see (what I can understand) is:
---
* You are a gatherer, you gather some herbs or whatever, then you get your friend to invite you to their layer and then you can gather the same herbs again.
---
* You are in wPvP and are fighting other people, they change layer and disappear.
---
We used to raid scholo with 40 and I remember half the raid dying from that green gas lol.
---
We used to raid that and ubrs because of the tier .5 gear.
---
I see no problem with it really. Makes communicating with my bnet friends not require alt+tab. I would like them to make separate tabs in the social screen for character friends though. It gets cluttered with both bnet friends and character friends in the same list.
---
Keep crying
---
Im assuming you believe that because they aren't 1:1 with the private server you played, that it's not really vanilla.
---
There was an addon I used in vanilla called DrDamage. No clue if a classic version exists, but it had all the coefficients and such baked into the tooltips of your spells.
---
&gt; I cant wait to be locked out of joining my friends on layer 3 because its full, 
---
How is this any different from the current system?  Blizzard wont put you on a full layer.
---
I mean just Mute trade chat...
---
disgusting
---
so many pepegas... MY EYES!!!
---
I remember Totalbiscuit years ago talking about the problem with streamers and youtubers and the cult of personality that they would have with their audience. He said it was something he noticed having over his own viewers as well which is why he went to a lot of effort to tell his audience to use other sources aswell.
---
It’s just casuals trying to validate them being slow
---
I hope people would do this at launch but  I am afraid too many is busy rushing to get 60..
---
Who are these weak people who just want to swim in someone’s wake? JFC play the game.
---
I think watching streams is dumb when you could be playing. Streamers and their fanbois need to get dunked. Buncha sheep.
---
&gt; harassed me
---
sure my dude
---
It says it, I'll give you that. I do not believe it.
---
They do it mostly while leveling because most of them unsurprisingly level as retribution.
---
You could also not invite them to dungeons if you are really concerned about them rolling on mail/plate gear. Which is silly imho. Shaman are going to roll on your 2-handers, you're going to roll on rogue leather and so on.
---
It shouldn't be an issue in raids.
---
Basically just the community being like "hey man i don't think i need the crutches, i'd rather just try walking without them"
---
*blizzard proceeds to break both of our legs with a lead pipe*
---
Well ok, NOW we need crutches. You sure proved us wrong Blizzard.
---
Guaranteed there is some slightly brain damaged people at launch going like "SEE, we needed layering, these two servers have like a 100k population each! Imagine it without layering". I can't wait.
---
The API is different. That's the reason add-ons have versions that correspond to the game version.
---
Imagine allowing yourself to be triggered by a dude named Edgysan
---
If you dislike layering, worry not. Layering will only be used for a couple of weeks or maybe a monthat the start of Classic WoW, in order to balance the huge influx of players in the same zones. Once the situation reaches a controlled state, it will be completely disabled and realms will once more have one instance of themselves. Layering also will not happen after Phase 1, the importance of that being that Phase 2 is planned to introduce the World Boss Kazzak, with the Green Dragons being released later on, both of which would make layering a tool to disrupt the flow of World Bosses in Classic.
---
Lol those dweebs
---
“Reported for harassment for playing PvP on a PvP server!”
---
Well do that then.. all is fair on war and love
---
Killed everything possible. Nothing helps. 
---
My startup is minimalistic as possible too.
---
Cheers :)
---
So you both were taking off lol
---
All this talk about playing with friends but the amount of abuse layering will put on resources is a huge issue.. 1 guy can steal the black lotus spawn on multiple layers by hopping quick enough etc. (Making alts on diff layers to move your main, or getting help from like minded people who also want to hop).
---
Some people are going to get very rich with this tech.
---
Fuck chance that dumb queef
---
Made same thread the other day, got downvoted because ganking streamers is apperantly immature and toxic.
---
This sub has no balls to stand up to 10 streamers...
---
It's really sad. Pservers have dealt with 100x worse over the past 4 years. Chinese. Russians. Language isn't an issue in classic unless you make it out to be one.
---
You are supposed to be screwing over the opposing faction on a WoW PVP server. If you are giving your opponent free information, maybe stop doing that instead of trying to use your influence to prevent someone from getting into groups because of something they are supposed to be doing.
---
The main problem I would assume most people have currently is that allowing streamers to warp the blacklist towards their goals is unfair to the rest of the playerbase, and that on a PVP server one faction should not socially interact or influence the other. Why are they getting special treatment when they are purposely screwing themselves over? Does everyone get to blacklist people from the other faction now if they get corpse camped? How do you stop the streamers from blacklist someone who just got a good gank in on them and wasn't sniping?
---
Now, don't get me wrong, coming from OSRS and seeing some of the stuff that happened around streamers like Ice Poseidon, some people deserve a ban from the game, but that should be on Blizzard, not the streamer.
---
There are different zones in the continents of wow. Some are horde friendly, some alliance, and some contested. This is in the horde start area which is friendly to horde so the starting horde players can't just be camped by alliance. UNLESS they flag themselves for PvP by attacking an alliance player (or in this case, their pet.) This hunter used a low level tamed boar to bait a horde player to attack it, flagging him for PvP. The hunter then chased him down now that he is free to be attacked.
---
Fk those guys, griefing because "the game allows it"
---
it's crazy to me because it was at +7 at 1 point and it's literally saying endgame classic is watered down retail LOL.  what the actual fuck
---
How are they going to fix this in 2 weeks? This is very concerning...
---
One of the worst problems of vanilla was absolutely anemic servers. They're solving that.
---

what the fuck cultural differences have to do with someone being bad/trolling/inting/being toxic at a video game? every single "culture" have players doing this every day. Tyler1 one of the most toxic trolls ever isn't a Brazilian.
---
re read the post and maybe you'll understand it better.
---
What exactly was the ratio. Im playing on a pvp in na if it's different than the other regions.
---
Also don't underestimate alliance. Human racial is probably the most underused/underestimated. Stone form is amazing and fear ward makes alliance priests outclass horde. The ability to stealth gank or hide in the shadows as any class. Whatever the gnome racial is can't be that bad. Then you have trolls... Most useless race ever.
---
Make bank alts and try to sell leather and other goodies in bulk in trade chat. That bathroom break that turned into walking around your house for an extra ten minutes is a chance for the other dude to make some money. Leather and cloth will eventually, you just have to get lucky and catch the right person at the right time
---
I used to sell spots to arabs because there were many on our server. They were giving so much gold I could give consumables and gold like candy and the whole guild was happy. Now it will happen way more.
---
Esfand seems pretty cool from what I've seen, but I don't think streamer personality is the big issue.
---
action is coming...
---
I mean, if you turn it around, he's proposing using his celebrity to harass regular players who may not even have any idea who he is beyond "hey look, there's a Horde guy, let's fight him!"
---
Granted I'm sure it makes sense from his perspective. Doesn't make it good policy though, know what I'm saying?
---
The only irony here is you came in hot saying I was "complaining with no solutions in hand" and leave posting memes and one word answers because you were just a shill apologist all along that was incapable of thinking for yourself.
---
this is the classic spirit, youre awesome man, keep it up!
---
There's a mature language filter in the game for a reason. If you're harassing someone obviously you deserve to be banned but just using a swear word shouldn't be bannable
---
I'd rather they just remove it entirely as well, and add more servers so weren't not all stressed out about getting stuck with streamers or BR/SA players..
---
What?  You are just letting your imagination get the best of you.  What proof do you have?  Why would you even say that?  Literally nothing other than you want to believe that classic wont be the same.  It will be fine, you will have fun and it will be memorable in its own way.  Relax and stop making up stuff in your head to bring you down.

I was just about to say that.

Great
---
Is there somewhere where I can find more info on the 2 realms?
---
I saw Hungaria is going Golemagg? 
---
And where are APES going?
---
I mean they have an upper hand when it comes to choosing server. They don't care where they roll but all the people wanting to avoid them do.
---
Thank fuck for this comment. I was getting proper scared but this seems like a temporary mistake then :)
---
No i'm sure Blizzard will stick to their word and not continue down the slippery slope. The two English PvP servers they planned will surely be able to handle the non-layered phase 2 demand of 6000 concurrent players.
---
No. People want to believe that blizzard will revert to having it though because they hate Blizzard blindly. Best we can hope for is less than a month of this unfortunately.
---
In vanilla if you were on the same servers as your friends you could play with your friends.
---
The problem is the precedent has been set that they are not going to fix the issue. This are not bugs, this is how sharding works and it’s what we are getting come launch. Everyone wants Classic to succeed and everyone is “bitching” because the version of the game they want to roll out is going to be a shit show of phasing.
---
I just used it to get the horde exclusive pets like snakes and cockroaches, then resell them on the IF AH for a tidy profit.

---
Autoshot have a 0,5 cool down, this macro starts both autoshot and sends your pet to attack.
---
I couldn't care less about some confused dunce. It's just mind boggling to me how someone can be this clueless.
---
Or just don't be an idiot and spam a chat channel and get reported by a bunch of people.
---
Good luck with a dead server within months
---
They should just get the name and not recreate the character till later
---
They're going horde because they know pvp players prefer horde, in other words, less people to gank them
---
Tips is a crusty fucking goat anus.
---
Mostly.
---
ah my [battle.net](https://battle.net) wasnt updated in years and i didnt have the menu lol
---
Asmongold should be banned from classic. Whatever server he be on will be toxic as hell! Since I’m not going for any record time to 60 I’m gonna wait a day.
---
I meant I earned more as I grinded to the cap. It was 55s per green quest at 15 but I completed exactly zero and had enough petty cash to train all spells plus enough trade for wand/fishing/cooking.
---
Most of them would be aussie which do speak English, but yea I get ur point the 5 American pvp servers is not much
---
&gt;Mailing multiple items at once is also being changed but no one is complaining because it's easier to have 14 items in one mail instead of 14 individual mails.
---
This is how I feel about AOE looting too.  It has been so long that I forgot sparkles don't float from unlooted corpses in vanilla so if they're stacked it's going to be a pain in the ass to mouseover the correct bodies
---
Layering should be gone before 90% of the player-base even get to 60. Without it the first week would be unplayable anyway. Once it is gone the spike would have dropped a little and should be playable. LAYERING ISN'T LASTING FOR MONTHS. get that in your head.
---
people will be so desperate for healers they wont care if youre playing a murloc
---
Will the level 50 Class Quests will be available from phase 1?
---
Ya, not sure why I picked the class Im gonna play myself instead of just fooling around with something I normally never play ;-)
---
&gt;The drop rate isn’t the best and the loot table isn’t small either.
---
These mean the same thing....
---
anyway like I said small upgrade from thrashblade and easily replaced at 60.
---
It was, at the time, a one day stress test only to 15 that was closer to release of classic not to be a waste of sub to wow. 
---
I’d say this crowd of lvl 1s and barrens raiding isn’t the same. It’s annoying that there is layering at all and this is a problem. 
---
Not an asmongol but Friday’s asmon lair day didn’t bother me as much.
---
Clueless about *what*? Whether or not it was standard to use voice-comms in vanilla?
---
Can't blizzard enforce all streamers to play on 1 server? I feel like classicwow will go to shit real fast when the streamers server hop.
---
Hi, /u/KattiannaWhite

---
&gt; Besides that.. a streamer holding some event in IF or Org.. what harm does it cause?
---
You mean beside thousands of people, many of whom may not even play on the server regularly, packing the area out, spamming the city chat to oblivion and lagging out everyone around? Yeah that isn't going to be at all annoying and destructive for those who just want to play the game is it?
---
He always rubbed me the wrong way. Guess my gut wasn’t wrong about him.
---
&gt;Makes communicating with my bnet friends not require alt+tab.
---
Blizz already said chat with bnet friends will remain in classic. This is just simply cross realm whispering.
---
Yep, but is the same that "you can't kill people". Of course you can go outdoor and shoot, but you "can't".
---
That why i was talking about semantic etc. It's another kind of discussion.
---
And further more, what's the point to tell someone to do something, if he can do whatever he wants?. The way is to convince. That's the source of "You will win, but you will not convince".
---
If what they wanted was an accurate portrayal of how many people is gonna play Classic they would have opened up the stresstest without requiring a subscription. Otherwise their data is corrupt.
---
Why are those streamers delaying and holding the community hostage like this? Is it an ego thing?
---
In pvp servers horde is out numbering alliance so far.
---
At least according to the poll on this site and others. 
---
I know that's a small percentage of players. 
---
But i was horde in vanilla and we dominated the alliance on my server.  Was boring.
---
Yes.
---
Yet it's often the exact same players who are talking about how they'll run the Ungoro Mafia (this time for real!) ;)
---
Same. Definitely going to play on the English server
---
what class should I play
---
I think you think sweaty nerds have less time on their hands than they do.
---
actually the complete opposite for me. i dont mind most and like a very few but esfand to me seems to be the most shady/manipulative of any of them
---
I don't see changes being an issue if it doesn't stray too far from the intentions of what classic was made for, which is to simulate as close as possible the gameplay and social aspect of how vanilla was back in the days.
---
However, your point of view regarding " they’ll HAVE to add content to the game to keep the player base engaged , no? " is missing the point of classic completely, It would no longer be classic if they added content to it, because that would change the gameplay aspect, as there would be more to play through than what the original game had to offer at the time
---
But most of those guys will go PVE servers i think.
---
I saw this face as well using Classic Cast Bars. It was next to a spell being cast by a mob and I thought it was funny without knowing what it was.
---
None of what they’re talking about is a problem on retail. You might get a whisper like this once in a blue moon. 
---
Funny thing is this is exactly why this community is always circlejerking about that orc rogue that spent every waking moment ganking in menethil harbor in vanilla. But I guess the idea of it occasionally happening to themselves is terrifying.
---
&gt; We are nowhere even CLOSE to the threat of ghost servers.
---
You misunderstand. 
---
It is better to start with a smaller number of servers and add more as needed, than to have a bunch of servers at start and have bad population spread (like my example shows).
---
So you're saying it's a big issue?
---
&gt;Yeah it's about a time when social interactions in games meant more.
---
The thing is, nothing prevents you from doing that in any other game. Nothing. Yet people don't do that. I wonder why.
---
People will come back when each Phase releases.  You can't shut off layering right at the end of P1 and expect it to hold up when P2 releases all new content to the servers.  Layering is always going to be a thing in Classic until after Naxx is released and the population has no reason to come back once they take a break.
---
They said that layering will never change your layer unless you relog, why does that happen here?
---
Not torn at all.  RP-PVP.  We have plenty of people sticking together from ED and going to Grobbulus.  And Horde side, we are already planning RP-PVP!
---
It'll be interesting to see how they handle 2 english PvP servers without layering.
---
Read the comment I responded to again...?
---
Actually, I hope it stays indefinitely.
---
&gt;Lmao fuckem. If they want to guilt trip you for not autopiloting your +10 for the week, they're shitty.
---
I mean... if the expectation is that you **are** doing your +10, and the rest of the guild is, that's not shitty at all. If you're not doing it, you're just being lazy and disrespectful to the rest of the raid group.
---
&gt;Especially when this xpac has shown you don't need to be as sweaty as previous expansions to raid mythic
---
Yeah, exactly. A +10 is &lt;30 mins a week commitment lol. Would you show up to a raid in Classic that expects people to have a minimal amount of consumables with 0 consumables?
---
Let’s not pretend people care about punctuation and capitalization online. His English is perfect. Who cares if he capitalizes names?
---
Guess I didn't get my point across properly, what I'm trying to say is context matters, not all insults have to be mean spirited so they shouldn't get flagged as offensive by default.
---
&gt; Pvp is in there. It's a pvp realm.
---
There is clear distinction between RP-PvP and PvP realms in OP's post. The fact it has PvP in the name doesn't make it another PvP realm. This realm type is a mix of two rulesets, written or unwritten, and if you don't feel like abiding by both, then pick either a pure PvP or an RP realm.
---
And to whoever says they're RPing the friendly neighbourhood exterminator by corpse-camping: don't confuse roleplaying with metagaming!
---
&gt; Get a grip.
---
Please refrain from personal attacks.
---
Holy paladins typically run imp. BoM, though
---
I don't spam but I will occasionally join in with a link or two. Are there really people that bothered by it? Do you also report people for chuck Norris jokes in barrens chat? Wouldn't it be much simpler to just download your own filter if you're really that bothered by it. Let the spergs have their autistic fun.
---
Just the polls out now. Including the reddit one. 
---
I could be way off though. I know it's a small percentage of players on the polls.
---
I like Redridge Mountains.
---
But since I'll be playing Horde again, I won't be enjoying any time in there. So my second pick is Feralas.
---
today's kids apparently watch streamers like we watched tv. And then they want to do everything the steamer does, so that includes being in the same game.
---
Okay this may be a silly question, but thats the whole point of this so im going to ask. I want to play on the one RPVP server. Im on the east coast and its a Pacific server. Should I expect this to make a difference in my connection? Will it not be as smooth?
---
After the Classic WoW announcement, I found Esfand, and he was the first Twitch streamer I followed.
---
Being an old Vanilla WoW veteran, I wasn't sure I'd enjoy the perspective of most Classic WoW streamers who may have started in Vanilla but gained their top tier end-game experience from a private server.
---
Esfand genuinely loves Vanilla WoW, and his enthusiasm is contagious. He's a great dude who is fun to watch and play alongside.
---
You guys are going to burn him at the stake for being competitive come raid time?
---
Come on, give him a break. Jesus.
---
How about "NoChangers" like myself that have no intention of calling you a douchebag and just disagreeing?
---
Yes it does.

---
Listen I'm all up for making it loud and clear to blizz that we dont accept this bug and we should make sure they fix it. 
---
There is 0 chance of them removing layering though so complaining about that will do nothing. Besides, as much as I hate the idea of layering, I realize it's a necessary evil but I hope they remove it as soon as possible.
---
What’s sad is it not even unreasonable to believe it. The goalposts have been moved multiple times from just starting zones at the beginning of launch all the way to the entire world for all of phase 1, which will be a couple months. 
---
I don’t know why everyone thought that blizzard could deliver vanilla wow without screwing it up. The entire WoW team is completely different than it was in 2004 and are the same team that gave us the shit platter that is retail.
---
Fuck off randy
---
If you agree that Vanilla wasn’t hard then why do you have such a hard time believing that most top guilds didn’t use voice?
---
Yeah i agree with you, the case is that in this context, it appears to be intended more than a bug.
---
Once more, i hope to be wrong!
---
I learned it will be best to give it a day or two after launch before I start playing to let the entry zones thin out a bit
---
Enchantrix learned that this video disenchants into distilled essence of classic.
---
Yeah I mean, he could have said it like that.
---
Could of been nicer, sure.
---
Not arguing that.
---
Same setup. Ultrawide is so nice for adding, especially during raids.
---
I like how none of what he mentioned is even possible in retail.
---
How? He didn't even freak out
---
Eventually classic wow will die out if there wont be any new content. 
---
Im all for changes after the naxx patch with the classic spirit in mind.
---
Can you find where they said that?
---
basketball eating walrus-assed motherfucker!
---
I think Orc is best followed by Undead.
---
If we are talking WPVP.
---
I think most people would agree that's the top two.
---
Dwarf is good and gnome is mediocre.
---
no I think you should leave the discord
---
If anyone thinks WoW tokens will stop gold sellers then here is some proof to change their mind.
---
It’s generally no different from a pve server. There’s just naming rules in place.
---
The thing is tho. If you roll a pvp server you can/will/should get ganked. Its all part of the game. If you can't handle it and want pvpers to be blacklisted because they are farming you, you don't belong on a pvp server and should roll a pve instead.
---
Because I *actually played the game at the time.*
---
is there any news of people running mischievious bands of streamer griefers?
---
are you living under a rock? people want to avoid the literalgods that streamers are
---
It doesnt take 5 minutes to kill someone.
---
&gt; This means that you can make a character on the opposite faction using a PvE realm as a proxy and trash talk someone for ganking you for example on a PvP realm.
---
I welcome someone dumb enough to do that. 
---
Report and block that player and sit back as they get a 3 day ban.

INV TO GGX LAYER
---
You can play the game with 30 FPS.
---
Richturpin and his highwaymen are my new heroes.  I really like that they are dworfs, to add insult to injury
---
So it's almost identical to sharding, except you can't leave that phase once pulled into it.  
---
So I can STILL be in org and not see my guildies because they're in a different layer and the only way to see them would be to pull them into my ~~shard~~ layer by grouping.  
---
I'm not sure this is a strong argument for you.  
---
If I'm misunderstanding something here, I'm all ears. This sounds like an awful solution to having so few servers.
---
&gt; it’s not the end of the world but it definitely is a major inconvenience  for anyone who wants to play the game for its intended purpose.  
---
*Intended purpose?* Where can I find this intended purpose?
---
&gt; Being forced to hop to a server with foreign speakers last minute  because of a steamers selfish choice to not announce plans is definitely  getting “fucked over”. 
---
You have to play with people who you can't understand? Man, that's gotta be rough. Then again, by recent estimates, even Thalnos, "the BR server", is only going to have *maybe 5-7%* of the entire server population who speaks Portuguese. So, how is that being "fucked over"? 
---
Let's say you wanted to move to a new city for a better job that would guarantee that 95% of your life would get better, but then you found out that 5% of the population there spoke Swahili. Would you say, "Man, I was going to do that, but these Swahilis are fucking me over"? 
---
No. Stop whining.
---
nice, I did not know that
---
You keep using this word. I do not think it means what you think it means.

this is absolutely epic upvoted for clever use of game mechanics good sir! well played!
---
This has gotta be right up there.

Because people aren't morons.
---
If you gank him 4 times, he goes to a completely different zone and you're arriving there 10 minutes after doing the same thing, it's pretty damn obvious. Don't you think?
---
Jai été dans un chalet toute la fin de semaine et je retourne chez moi dans quelques heures. Je verrai ce que je peux faire d'ici demain.
---
americans not only get shot but their games are fucked aswell
---
No vanilla at all
---
Because having more servers and having to merge them later is better ? That make the game look bad and if Blizzard take too much time to merge them the servers get emptier over time.
---
literal cancer , glad I'm EU
---
Yes but its not practical when u upgrade de gear all the time
---
You only need to install the classic version.  You install it like you would the ptr.  Above the play button is a drop down menu that you select classic.
---
I don't think they are better, but early raiding with semi-noob people is a lot easier with Salvation.
---
*Working as intended.*
---
No scaling. You keep your level. You can die in two seconds.
---
Choosing to misgender someone and then say that nothing bad happened is like blaming a rape victim. There's a reason many of the accounts involved got at least a temporary suspension
---
Yeah like what the hoards of their fanboiz do to anyone that somehow wrongs their idol?
---
Well what are you going to do to stop them? It's us that don't want to play with them, not the other way around. I mean even if we "claim" a server, what's stopping Asmongold from just joining in and doing what he wants? People aren't bending over, they just realize there is nothing they can do but choose a different server.
---
Leatrix plus
---
That shit will be the death of Classic and they'll blame it on the players.
---
I don't watch any streams nor do I care about streamers. That said, I usually pvp whenever and wherever I am, so the thought of unknowingly killing a streamer out there and then getting blacklisted for it kind of bums me out.
---
So you were there? You listened to the Portuguese? You seem to also think you are restricted to server choices because of the country you're in? I can play on a german server if I wish does that mean I have to be in germany? Nope.  No one said Ragnaros was a Brazilian server maybe try reading again and you'll see I never said that it was.
---
On PvP Servers you cannot make chars on 2 factions. If you have a Horde char on PvP server, you cannot make an Alliance char on that same server. This was done to prevent people from flaming other players for ganking them.
---
With this I can play Horde, have an Ally on a different server and flame away if someone displeases me. Of ourse flaming is still against the rules but this took a lot of work off them, saved people from harming themselves (by flaming and getting punished) and while some people get off of getting flamed (because that means they successfully pissed the other guy off) others would have felt bad about getting insulted so... bottom line it wasn't a terrible feature and should be back in.
---
We still have B.Net if we want to chat to friends.
---
Chaos is a ladder.
---
If there were more servers, or separate BR/LA servers we could do that.
---
to think there are no streamers when there is only 1 German PvP Realm is naive but sure it wont get any near this destructive like this
---
My condolences.
---
Passed through some pretty simmilar situation in 2 years ago.
---
Go over server
---
No one is going to be able to stream snipe these guys because you have a small chance of being on their layer. Layering will ruin this experience.
---
Merci mecton &lt;3
---
It’s all about the money. If they just had a long-term vision and give us what we want they’d probably make more money in the long run, but that’s not how corporate companies are run. It’s all about quick bucks for the investors.
---
I think I'll personally just wait for ElvUI to be released by those guy post-launch so it all works perfectly.
---
I mean, I can understand how the misunderstands happen.  If not everyone is on the same page, people can take things the wrong way, especially if it is outside the norm.
---
Literally just go to a PvE server
---
Back to braincels w/you
---
Nothing I said was a lie. It appears that you have some sort of vendetta against my guildmate, and that further reinforces why I started these discords. Hatred, racism, and harassment isn't something condoned by Blizzard, and shouldn't be condoned in the discord in which the server congregates in.

Moderate following the Discord ToS. 3. Remain impartial and hold no guild, faction, or individual biases. 4. Keep personal politics and beliefs out of moderation.

On saturday I got an of the eagle chestpiece on my Shaman. Then today I got a lvl 13 staff with int on my shaman. Also, had 3 bags drop on my journey from 1-15. Safe to say I used up all my luck
---
The hunter tamed a boar (they can tame animals) and named it the same name as other NPC boars in that area. 
---
He then used a spell to take control of his pet, which allows him to do what you see in the video. 
---
He then walks around like a boar in that area in the hope that a horde player will attack it. 
---
Name plates above players and NPCs come in three colors - Green for friendly, Yellow for Neutral, Red for Hostile. 
---
NPC boars in this area are Yellow. Enemy Players in this area are also Yellow (they turn red if you flag for pvp). 
---
This horde player sees the name of the hunter's boar as the same name as all the others, and it is yellow. So at first glance, it looks like a normal boar. That, and the player is also on autopilot more than likely and just killing shit ASAP. 
---
Once he tags the boar, the hunter player drops the spell and then runs out to kill the troll, who is now flagged for pvp since he attacked the hunter's pet.

Not sure why I’m getting downvoted. You get a mount, but no title. The title was added in BC. 2.0.3

"what!? Then why are we playing!?"
---
You’re all just looking to hedge your bets so you have an excuse when you quit in two weeks. 
---
This is exactly what all of the sane people called a year ago. You’re all just lookin for an out, you never wanted classic, you just want to ride whatever negative bandwagon suits your fancy. If layering for a month keeps you from playing, then you’re just a sad reactionary.
---
One of my strongest memories from playing this thirteen years ago was playing way late into the night, trying to climb up some hard-to-climb terrain with a few friends (just because we could), getting to the top of a little mountain, then looking up and watching the sunrise.

I hope you stay on retail indefinitely.  
---
I've never seen anyone argue FOR the community getting split up indiscriminately. Care to elaborate why?
---
People are losing their minds because a lot of streamers are going to play wow and they're afraid their server will be ruined because streamers are on it because the fans will be annoying and I guess the majority of the population forgot how to use the ignore button.
---
I understand being annoyed by fans who spam trade chat but sweet Jesus the constant posts crying about it or saying "let's harass them until they leave" are just as cancerous
---
Does it matter if 5x streamers with average of 1k viewers roll horde, when one bald man with 20k viewers rolls alliance?
---
I couldn’t agree MORE but let’s be real.
---
The streamer is going to be surrounded by droves and droves of fanboys doing anything to get on stream. You don’t actually think you’ll be lucky enough to find a literal neckbeard streamer in SVT alone do you? If you do, chances are they are levels above you Bc it’s their literal full time job to game so. Unless you have no life good luck.
---
Fair enough. Guess we'll see in classic :)
---
Cross-faction whispers don't work outside of Battl.net friends on retail, so it would be very surprising if they do under any circumstances in Classic. 
---
The ability to have/create a proxy character of the opposite faction on a pve
---
There's some merit to screwing yourself out of content. There was a guy "bucksworth" on our server that ninjad an Onyxia head and said "you got bucksworth'd" and yet someone still invited him into a FFA loot raid and surprise he ninja'd again haha.
---
But yeah, stream sniping of streamers, big whoop you can't get in guilds that are fans of their community. To me, you'd not want to raid with them anyway.
---
I've never tried RP, I read your entire post.  Why not just flag/unflag for PvP?  You say you want it as a "mechanic" of roleplay.  If you are communicating cross faction for PvP anyways what difference does it make if the realm is PvP or not? Roll RPPvE, flag for PvP when you want and get the best of both worlds and solve your problem.  What's the worse problem? Getting griefed for hours or clicking flag for PvP?  Pick the lesser of two evils in your case, don't rely on Blizzard for anything, and don't expect "manners"  from players in a video game.

This is a great comment! I agree 100% with everything you said. Of my guild of 20, three of us are subbed for the name reservation. The rest haven’t even downloaded the game yet......
---
It’s sad that the true Classic experience was attempted to be recaptured by the Classic team, but at the end of the day the server count is going to completely screw the experience up. I do believe that layering is the answer for the “tourist” problem, but they are about to layer the shit out of these 5 PvP realms and phase 2 will still have layering.

What do you like to do and have you played before
---
I learned that 2 gathering skills is profitable, but probably not as fun.  I had decided on skinning and herbing on my warrior until 60 - then drop skinning and go alchemy.  However, while I was leveling in the stress test I REALLY missed the prospect of making my own potions.  I'm completely torn now because I also REALLY loved skinning.  I was fairly resolved on my profession plan - now I'm in turmoil.  It's going to take me until 2020 to hit 60 - and I'm not sure if I can swing two gathering professions that long.  
---
Also, I had to re attune my mindset as a warrior to not waste my time with orange or red quests.  I spent a couple hours trying to muscle through some of the higher level centaur kill quests in the barrens, fighting mobs that were 2 levels higher than me.  I returned to mulgore and finished a couple yellow quests I had to pass on earlier.
---
My last takeaway was how much fun it was to just casually run around and not feel rushed.  If I want to whip out my fishing pole and catch some fish to cook, that's fine.  If I want to do a death run through a higher level zone to get some flight paths, that's fine too.  There's no way I'll hit 60 in a good amount of time so might as well smell the roses on the way.  It took me 12 hours to get to 15, and considering I took my sweet time - Im fine with it.
---
Because I don’t care.
---
Sodapoppin specifically is super duper likely to decide that random people who gank him are streamsniping.
---
Conveniently forgot to mention that once you got banned from streaming pservers you began playing retail and other games instead of farming for gold. And then used the gbank to fund your ret paladin consumables. Consumables that would cost upward of 300+ gold per raid night. You neglect to mention the officer meeting we had where we called you out on this and threatened to kick you from your own guild after 3000+ gold went missing from our bank alt.
---
World first vanilla happened 15 years ago. World first classic has not happened.
---
In vanilla WoW people were mostly night elf female priests and managed to clear all the end raids just as fine so don't sweat about it lol. The ratio population for priest compared to other classes is pretty slim so almost any guild would accept any healers no matter what race you pick. Let the person who's worried about wanting to minmax the most out of his gameplay by playing the Dwarf with Fear Ward while you enjoy still getting into guilds and rocking the race you want...unless he likes playing Dwarf!
---
Plus you have to considered that if classic WoW becomes successful and they decide to do progression servers into TBC (Which is most likely; Everquest has a progression server it will happen to WoW) all the priests would get fear ward anyways so you're stuck with maybe a race you didn't want to play in the first place and would have to start from scratch if you want to continue playing priest.
---
I have render scale set to 175% and get around 90-100 FPS while in Elwyn Forest questing. What is considered a good FPS while raiding? If I push to 200% render scale I run about 50-70 FPS. What is considered an optimal FPS?
---
&gt; Its the social interfearance and effects it can have on server communities.
---
You'd have to first know the person and know that they are on that server. 
---
This wouldn't have any effect on anyone except maybe streamers or "popular" people.
---
You're acting like this is going to be a permanent thing.  Would you rather 10 hour que times, larger number of servers that end up becoming barren,  or sometimes not seeing your guildy running around org for the first month or two of release? I know my choice.
---
Between this, the streamers, and the extremely limited number of servers on launch, I'm starting to think Blizzard is intentionally sabotaging Classic because they truly don't want to support it.
---
You’re acting like everyone is going to do name reservations. The vast majority of my friends are not doing name reservations.
---
Is your monitor good enough to notice the 200% render scale? I significantly prefer sitting at 100% because it lets me stay nice and snug at 100 and it looks barely different than 200%. That being said, if you're at 50-70 already then in a raid it might droop to 30ish. Which is okay, but you'll feel it if you've gotten used to high FPS
---
The same thing in two months when one or both pvp servers gonna have too much players and they will add few servers with free transfert.
---
If they can do it in two months, they can do it now without the layering thing.
---
Full servers to empty servers, people will not move even with free transfert. Dead servers to high population, people will move with free transfert. 
---
So even the logic with adding more servers in two months if requiered is dumb compared to add servers from the start and remove layering
---
Good to hear.
---
One idiot in voice chat said "you earned it"
---
It’s really annoying because in my duo speedrun route I’m able to complete that undead warlock quest and quickly hearth back to razorhill just as my hunter partner completes their lvl 10 hunter quest. Both times I couldn’t turn in void walker quest and hearth to pick up conscript of horde and run to crossroads. It’s making me question if I should bother going to other continent without mass whispering people for a layer invite before daring going over. Launch gonna be a shit show. It’s
---
nice, cheers
---
Yeah, having it off subscription would potentially cause the opposite problem (overestimating instead of underestimating), so that method got issues as well.  
---
Perhaps a good old pop-up on the Blizzard launcher "Survey: Will you reactivate your subscription to play Classic when it releases? Yes - No" would have been the best gauge, but that just feels kinda unprofessional, so I can see why they didn't do something like that.
---
I am not reserving my name...
---
Is there a consensus on which servers streamers will be on? I don’t really mind as I do not watch stuff like that, but if they are to be stirring up problems on server communities, I would love to avoid it altogether.
---
Some of us have been in guilds for years.
---
I frown upon that as well, our society is tragically vicarious.
---
No, its not obvious. Maybe I gank him 4 times because its fun to camp people. Then I move on to the next zone and see him again and decide to gank him again. Happens all the time and will likely happen to him from people that arent stream sniping and will get fasley blacklisted.

Well, you need to think of the player coming back. Most of us know what we are getting into and it’s not all just nostalgia and we’ve forgotten the grind. I remember the grind and how awful it was, but great at the same time. You also have new players coming in that are playing with their friends....these guys have a high retention rate because they are playing the game with their friends.
---
You’ll have brand new players that will quit after level 10, but retention rates might surprise us this time around. Maybe 50%?
---
You do. Parry reduces your next auto attack cooldown by 40% (ish). Usually youll just get a nice reset
---
Nono, the Gurubashi n stuff. Where you can even fight your m8s
---
Dumb.
---
Isn't that going to underestimate? I think there's a significant population that doesn't care about name reservation and isn't going to waste half a month of subscription before the game is even playable.
---
I'm not saying you're not right but where'd you get this info? I'm just curious!
---
Classic WoW
---
"Intended purpose" is actually playing the damn game and not spamming world chat making it twitch chat and crowding around a single person in a permanent 100-man fanboy raid that drops every players fps. I did not see the recent estimates on Thalnos but I hope with what you said stays true to launch. I am not whining or complaining about the situation, I will play on Herod regardless on how many streamers join, I just want there to be a solid community that wishes to play the actual game because Herod will, without a doubt, be the most popular server. With popularity becomes more intense events, better economy, etc. I encourage people to play on Herod regardless of what happens. What I am against is going on a less populated server for the sake of avoiding streamers.
---
Good points. I'd also say new servers post-launch are a good way to get players who hear about classic but don't want to start behind.
---
I actually think that golemagg was a cooler boss than shazzrah

But I heard there's gonna be a spanish inquisition on golemagg?

---
Reacting even slightly negatively to being ganked is a bit ridiculous from someone who is only known for WPVPing people to death with a top-tier 1v1 class...comes off as a bit hypocritical.
---
I actually wonder how many people are going to buy the sub half a month early to reserve their super-unique nick. For me it feels really dumb to actually do that
---
That's like burning the house down to kill a spider. Then again, the house seems to be filled to the brim and bursting with spiders in this case, so your experience is ruined either way and you don't want to live in the house.
---
And now you know why people wanted rp-pvp so badly
---
You're aware that nobody was really able to play for the first week when the game launched right? Is that what you're looking for in your vanilla experience?
---
Afaik Blizzard stated you can change servers every half year or so. If shit really hits the fan, you can just pack up shop and move over to a more populated server.
---
However I doubt the server pop will drop below 2000 peak evening.
---
Melee cleave with 3x War and Windfury becomes faster around SM. Sorry, alliance plebs.
---
Yep that's why I never played wow post wotlk, and instead I've played on pvservers for years. Now I'm waiting classic but if they keep this layering thing on pvp servers I will not playing.
---
Yep, good bandwagon, very fancy but much more sad
---
That was original wow though. We are all veteran players and know how the game works. We are bribing new players with us that will stay with the game because we are their gaming friends.
---
I’m bringing 8 new players to the game that regularly play other games with me.

Glad im from EU. :D

Alright I see you spamming the same question so I’ll regurgitate the same suggestion that’s been posted a million times on this subreddit.

Each server will be set up like this, and names will be exclusive to the server name not the shard.

Whitemane-1 (x/3000 players)
---
Whitemane-2 (x/3000 players)
---
Whitemane-3 (x/3000 players)
---
Create more as needed, merge once they die, allow people to choose their layer.
---
Now this isn’t going to happen, but this would be a better system than what we have now in the stress test.
---
Unfortunately, I don't believe that it's an option without the browser extension Reddit Enhancement Suite.

I can disable CSS on a per subreddit basis, either through the right hand side of my browsers address bar (https://i.gyazo.com/ff6b0e99db62425b01ae084effa6e215.png), on directly above the subscribe button (https://i.gyazo.com/cee9150f1d563dfe7c575abc25201fe4.png).

Are the party frames working for you with Elvui? I can't seem to get them to work on mine, along with hunter pet happiness indicator.

It's like nobody actually is passionate about that server so it will probably die.

To answer your question, my ideal launch would be that you select your layer before you log in, say you click login to server x then you get asked which layer you wanna join 1,2,3,4,5... however many needed to have a smooth launch and you can't randomly phase out of one into the other, if you wanna play with your friends you need to manually relog into their layer. Also I would only have this system for the starting zones, from lvl 10+ everything is spread enough that you don't need it anymore, also a few weeks after launch remove all layers.
---
They are going PvP tho
---
Because gold selling harms their product and streaming sells it. You have to be deliberately obtuse to pretend that's not obvious.
---
Read my other comment about server merging.
---
Bartender
---
Don't worry, there's a zest of hypocrisy sprinkled on, I'm aware.
---
No, thanks. I don't Play Pally. I thought you are trolling, because the thread is about people complaining. Sorry for you.
---
Calling people who disagree "shills" is valuable discussion though.
---
Dude, I have 20 people I’m coordinating to get on the same server...telling them to re-roll after making it past 10+ is not happening.
---
If you think that you can tell the difference between a stream sniper and a person that is actively participating in world pvp you are wrong. Soda is wrong. And the fact he will use his popularity to ruin other peoples experience with or without actual, legitimate proof is the reason why people are pushing back. Open your eyes and stop being a sheep.
---
I did. I’ve even gotten into some of my old characters to run around in modern to keep up the excitement for Classic.
---
Yeah... you have literally no power to stop people rolling wherever they want.
---
Mad cuz bad
---
"May have changed"
---
"May have"
---
"May"
---
That's basically what happens all the time. There are definitely mega spergs out there who stream snipe, but the majority of the time it's just normal pvp interactions.
---
These people are all just such kleptomaniac narcissists (an attitude reinforced by their armies of children and neckbeards) that they cant accept their own defeat, so they default to the assumption that their aggressor cheated.
---
So layering in the beginning and then you’re on a server with 35,000 people. Sounds sick. Have fun doing literally anything
---
They can have all the beta tests they want. They don't mean a damn thing if they don't actually fix the problems.
---
That's so beautiful.  He is doing the Lord's work.  Thanks for the link.  If I was a better player, I do what richturpin is doing.
---
What are you talking about? Of course blizzard is ok with it. As with most video game companies. It brings a lot of people into the game. It's free advertising and also streams are fun to watch sometimes... Give it a try.
---
&gt; To completely ignore this aoe spell, like you did, shows more of your own lack of knowledge about the class.
---
I can't tell if you're trolling or just not understanding the topic. 
---
What is the purpose of mentioning a spell that only effects two types of enemies that has an extremely long CD.
---
While other classes don't have that problem? 
---
&gt; I do agree it doesn't belong in a short overview of the class, but I will also say that paladin is a class that unlocks its full potential vs specific enemy types.
---
While the other two unlock their full potential almost at the start and maintain it through the rest of the game. 
---
If I have a choice between the three types of tanks for a group, paladin would be ***dead last*** almost every time.
---
That has too  much potential to be abused if people can pick and choose layers.
---
Why does everybody forget about the west coast servers? Y’all are some crybabies. Fuck streamers. Fuck Brazilians. But it’s not like nobody has a choice. Y’all are just dramatic for no reason.
---
I honestly feel a little bad for him, he genuinely seems to like the idea of Classic, but the way I see it his point is still valid. He was just mostly wrong. There will be SOME people who "Think they do but they don't" want Classic. I have a friend who is super excited about Classic, especially because of my no-life serious plans. They literally whispered me in game and asked if there was Transmog, because they didn't wanna look this stupid forever, among other questions. I have a feeling they won't actually make it to 60
---
Mulgore has too many quests that involve collecting items once you reach bloodhoof, so it really jams up your few bags. Other than that it's a breeze.
---
Yeah windfury is freaking amazing! For decently skilled people I think it's pretty even between Horde/Alliance raiding, but it usually only takes one dummy to over dps and the raid is wiping.  
---
Blessing of Kings also gives the tank and raid a nifty 10% stamnia increase on alliance side.  
---
I think a general consensus would be that horde raids can do more damage, but alliance raids are less punishing for when someone fucks up.
---
Use the search bar to find retorts to your comment about server merging.

There’s the solution, it’s better than the system we have, so be it.

But hey, I guess Activision Blizzard agrees with you so, congratulations.

It is the name u will carry the whole adventure, it is important for some ppl to feel it was the correct one, let ppl spend money on ehat they want :€

!remindme 6 months  
---
I guarantee Layering will be here way past Phase 1. Absolutely guarantee it.
---
Explain your point of view yourself.
---
Even easier because the spell batch window is bigger than it actually was back then.
---
I will never understand people watching people eat on stream.
---
In cities maybe, lots of people &lt;30 outside big cities don't speak great english, they are only trying to communicate the best way they can though.
---
Flying mounts, resilience, draenei/blood elves, the whole space theme, splitting the population between outlands and Azeroth - making azeroth redundant at max level, death of world pvp, daily quests, etc
---
Layering exist so all the spreadsheet kids have place at launch. They will quit when they realize that the end-game content is slim and you don't need BIS to clear MC. 
---
In the meantime after a day or two, Blizzard will announce how they didn't anticipate the popularity of the game and are adding fresh servers. New players and people with a life will roll on this server and you won't see a train following Johanna's guide to the next step.

And they don’t need em
---
Since it will only work in starting zones and for a few weeks it doesn't matter, what are people gonna do with layer switching, farm Hogger in elwynn forest or what lol.
---
It's rather easy to tell most of the time.
---
Prime example: crashing the PVP tournament on the beta servers. Of course people who did that were stream sniping or do you think they just organically "pvp'd" following around the tournament organizers even all the way UNDER Orgrimmar?
---
Clear cut case of stream sniping.
---
I played on an Ocean if realm throughout Wrath when I was stationed in Japan. Now I have a hard time buying groceries and talking to my children.
---
Turn your lighting quality down, looks like dynamic shadows
---
If they can do it in a way that keeps the integrity of classic, then sure, if they can't, then make more servers and handle it with "classic" technology.  
---
I have a hard time thinking layering is going away when we have so few servers and streamers are going to be flooding single servers and zones.  
---
But hey, I can only hope layering does go away and I can only hope that it doesn't ruin my first few weeks of stepping back into the nostalgia zone.
---
You know there are europeans too that subed ?
---
Man it sucks because your coming to a pvp server so you can open world pvp but the ping increase makes the sole thing you’re coming for harder. They really shat the bed with this. You should only have a pvp server and if people want to pve they should join other regions since the ping matters less. Or just have two servers
---
Oh boy. Another streamer whiner to block. I’m going to have half this subreddit blocked at this rate
---
Every time some idiot bombed into a layering thread with "That's why this is a beta. So they can fix it for live" I just had to face palm. Anyone who thought this shit wasn't making it live was delusional. The entire concept and implementation of sharding was broken from the start, so why would the Completely not the same thing at all (TM) layering be any different?
---
Classic version of skull tricking
---
I actually like I lost some IQ reading this

As long as they don’t take faerlina too. Its crazy to think they’re gonna try to take 2 of the est servers from na.
---
It really doesn't make sense. When you look at the names in Warcraft lore, you get a feel that it is rather similar to the type of fantasy language in Dungeons and Dragons. 
---
Neither 'Blau' nor 'meux' are elements of these fantasy languages. The first one maybe if it were something like Bla'u but some spelling like blow would probably be more appropriate. 
---
Meux doesn't really make sense at all. You would expect something French, right? But there aren't any silent letters and many of the French sounds are absent in these Fantasy languages. Meux wouldn't work at all. Maybe some Goblin named Meeyux.
---
Why don't you make like a tree and FUCK OFF
---
I lost brain cells reading this
---
I actually think Americans speak better english than the English. Scottish is a beautiful mystery though.
---
Maybe TBC only slightly. I enjoyed it. I remember not liking the daily quests. Also, I remember the next expansion being announced very quickly after TBC was released which took the wind out of my sails. I would kind of like TBC classic for this reason.
---
I do remember loving that first 10-man raid in that haunted house. It was amazing. I remember having fun with heroic 5-mans. WOTLK wasn't bad either. WoW had just run its course for me, after a while you want to move on from any game. The downward trajectory of WoW as slow. It was dramatic when I went back and tried WOD. 
---
TBC was by no means bad. I prefer classic, because of the 40-mans and the thrill of getting epic loot due to rarity. I liked the slower-paced raids/dungeons and the sort of unbalanced class system. 
---
If some of the elements of TBC were added to classic without upping the level cap it probably would have greatly improved the game. TBC first introduced the fact that all that work grinding for gear in classic would be irrelevant a few levels into the new expansion. This is sort of a bad feeling. 
---
Really, to me "peak WoW" was probably my guild's first rag kill. Or when I dinged 60 of when I completed my blue dungeon set, or got my epic mount. All of those things too tremendous effort. I don't think any achievement I had in TBC had that much joy.
---
Culture is certainly a part, but people tend to either downplay or simply be ignorant of biological factors.
---
For instance, East Asians have the lowest (ie best) reaction times to 'simple cognitive tasks' among any genetic population.
---
A meta-analysis recorded reaction times in milliseconds in a simple choice test as averages 423 Hong Kong, 433 Japan, 480 Britain, 485 Ireland, 489 South Africa. (published by the American Psychological Association, PM me for the paper)
---
Reaction times are fundamentally biological and have very little potential variability mostly from habituation (like repeating the same task, such as catching a ball, can eventually reduce reaction time but the delta is very small).
---
It is a leap from this fact but it can be safely assumed that Asians, on average, have an advantage when it comes to videogames in part to increased reaction times and possibly due to other physical and cognitive factors as well.
---
Of course this isn't the entire picture but we shouldn't discount different people's diverse genetic heritages.
---
If they were to do that, I believe it would be done on a seperate client.
---
I cannot remember exactly from where, but i heard an interview where the lead designer from the Classic team were asked if addin stuff to classic were on the table at the end of the content cycle, and he answered with a plane "No"
---
Why does that person have to scream in the mic like that?
---
Okay I am behind on things, as I don't watch streamers.  I would rather play a game, than watch someone else play.  But what do you mean by streamers blacklisting people?
---
Unplayable
---
They said that the number of subscribers increased
---
You fix it by hopping to the main UC layer.
---
Yeah I suppose we should all just shut up, you know just like what happened when "you think you do, but you dont". Thanks for reminding me.
---
agree 100 %. i playes a shaman to 30 on a private server couple of month ago and it was a blast .
---
That's a lot of likes. Are you from Facebook?
---
Exactly. This is what we all predicted when we insisted on no sharding or layers of any kind... and now it's coming true.
---
Whatever you find comfortable. Raiding doesn't really require snap reactions you might see in competitive shooters; people got by in the original vanilla with &lt;10fps by looking at the floor and just paying attention to their UI. Of course the intensity of your raid play also depends on your role somewhat.
---
I specifically remember ten man strath and scholo runs.....
---
And 10 lbrs and 15 man ubrs runs.
---
Gotta get stoned so I can make this jump!
---
No they don’t. The loot table could have 2 items on it and one could have a 98% drop rate over the other. There are 12 items on his loot table. The dalrends have lowest drop rate aside from felstriker.
---
You're right. It shouldn't.  And blizzard knows that.  It's not like they are intending for this to happen,  it's a kink in the system that they are working on with their available resources and time.
---
Asmond is the photo boy for neckbeard
---
You’re welcome.
---
I did, but i havint read all the details about the re-release.  I was expecting them to screw with stuff and change it. Im so happy now it will be the old way
---
I'm not fucking playing paladin lol. 
---
If I roll alliance and want to mainly heal, I'll roll paladin. 
---
They're poo trash for everything else.
---
Ppl just put race choice on a pedestal mane dw bout it
---
We need more of these kinds of posts instead of the multitude of "layering is trash and kills the community" posts.
---
This is the community.  Right here.
---
The problem isn't layering, the problem is people wanting to rush through everything and not wanting to interact with other players unless it benefits them in some way (such as dungeons or hard quests).  People confuse their own inability or unwillingness to socialize with layering doing it for them.
---
But I get it.  Nobody wants to get all introspective and examine themselves. Layering is a low-hanging fruit that's easily blamed for their own inadequacies.
---
Yep. She's addicted to uppers (coke), then takes an addict level dose of downer (heroin), which fucks her right up.
---
As it was the stress test it's very plausible they were doing funky shit with the layers intentionally.
---
&gt; if you really think it's advertising from streamers that are going to make or break Classic's success
---
I have never, nor will I ever say that. All I'm saying is that part of advertisement is drilling brand name into your skull. It's why you still see ads for WoW without adblock while on Youtube.
---
Maybe he was adopted?
---
Here is my main question.  Will there be any “dead servers”??  
---
I have heard that there will be less to chose from overall but I worry about this server choice.
---
As a Druid: "These guys were juxtaposing unusual animal names and greasy fast food products calling Randy names."
---
Scottish cunt reporting in. Fully in support of this motion.
---
Nobody fucking cares about streamers.  Bye.
---
Imagine getting down voted for the truth lol. Must be from people who think 8 hours a day with their girlfriend is a "must"
---
They were looking to create some sort of addon that streamers on both factions can come together and use to add the names of anyone who they perceive to be "Stream sniping" them to. All of the top guilds/streamer guilds will then have the addon installed and when someone who's "blacklisted" joins their group or messages them, they'll receive a notification to say that the player in question is blacklisted from which they will then be kicked and excluded from whatever activity it may be. 
---
So hypothetically lets say you're playing on the alliance and you gank Soda (Who's horde) a few times which results in him adding you to the blacklist addon. Then if you try to join a group with players from any of the big guilds on the alliance side they'll be notified that you're blacklisted and will subsequently remove you from any group.
---
Fantasy -  activity of imagining things, especially things that are impossible   
---
I don't believe you know what Fantasy means, I am not doing anything impossible here or imagining. I am quite certain the streamer may wish this is a fantasy but I can assure everyone it is not.
---
Fury/ melee?
---
Blizz has stated they want it authentic as humanly possible, so questions like this are sort of ... out of the question, so to speak.
---
It's up to blizz to make it possible to handle things. Not for them to take actions on things like this.
---
Try to find some. We need more drama.
---
That's exactly what you and the other dumbshits in here are saying.  Without streamers there will be no free advertising and Classic will fail.  It shows just how hopeless you are.
---
Believe you need to set value to 0 to show.

All I’ve done is the stress test to 15. Other than that’s I’m going in blind
---
Huh? Why would the staff swing timer keep ticking when you're wanding? It always reset
---
The transfers would have even been blizzlike too! Zero reason to introduce all these variables and chances for bugs especially when layering in and of itself is completely anti-classic.
---
All right, thank you for putting words in my mouth. Take your medicine now.
---
Have an appropriate roleplay name (so like, stabbymcstab isn't acceptable), be courteous to others, respect others out in the world when you see them roleplaying, and that's basically it.
---
You run through a city and everybody gets mad at you? That was my experience at least...
---
We need a athlete like you Randy
---
Blizz has stated they want it authentic as possible, so questions like this are sort of already answered
---
Lw/skinning. I’m my guilds lw on my pserver and i made half the servers devilsaur set. Probably somewhere around 80% of the servers hide of the wild.
---
I went so far as to include coworkers and acquaintances, of course not everyone is going to have trans friends. I merely meant, it's healthy to distance yourself from absorbing epithets, its not stressful to unfollow a streamer because they use language you dont agree with.
---
[*Laughs in European*]
---
You know you are literally doxxing tips by handing out that link that has a lot of his personal info? Besides they won the case you linked...

It doesn't really matter since EVERYONE rolling rp-pvp will be there. That means you'll find groups playing no matter what time it is.

Can't handle being called out on your bullshit?  You should take yours.

How would merging exclusive shards on the same server create naming issues OR community issues? Also could you give an example on how it will hurt the economy?
---
Are they?  Serious question, I've only seen positive stuff about classic.  Though I pretty much only frequent this sub.  Who doesn't want it to work out?  People who play current WoW?
---
&gt;Classic wow is a timesink, and it takes away from retail. There is no effective way to level efficiently and efficiently raid unless he's nolifing both
---
You're saying you can't play WoW unless you spend 40+ hours in game? lol. No, you just set expectations (whatever they are) and don't be a flake when you have commitments.
---
Not in 1.12
---
Did you open a bug report and/or report this on the official forums? I agree it's a bad problem but we need to let the dev's know.
---
Are we not adult enough to handle getting a whisper?
---
Like, what does it ACTUALLY hurt? Does it in some way change how you'll be able to play the game? Does being able to whisper someone completely ruin classic?
---
Oh no. Someone angry with you can make some pink text show up on your screen. Report them and move on.
---
Count me in
---
 How does runescape deal with exclusive content? Assume there is  [a rare](https://classicdb.ch/?npc=2779#comments) that has a long respawn. Is it OK to have lots of them on different servers? 
---
You might not care but assume you have one single guild that has people who have a high enough blacksmithing level to mine thorium. Instead of there being a single server's supply of thorium for every miner, they have lots of servers to mine in.
---
So basically one guild is going to gather loads of resources (especially devilsaur leather) just by the virtue of being the first ones to get there.
---
Are you OK with one guild being able to get lots of gear because they managed to exploit the most lucrative farm spots before anyone else?
---
How would you deal with raidbosses? If there is a guild that puts in the effort, there is no reason why they wouldn't be able to kill all raidbosses that spawn on every server, pushing them even further ahead?
---
Until you have solutions to these problems we shouldn't consider this, else it will cause major issues.
---
'Sturmwind', 'Jaina Prachtmeer'. I've never cringed so hard in my life ever again, after they decided to change all the names into the exact german translation. Thank god, they at least let Thrall keep his name.
---
The names of people and locations shouldn't be translated literally. They shouldn't be translated at all, in my opinion.
---
Show me where I said that the advertisement streamers bring to WoW will make or break classic's success. I'll wait.
---
Just use curseforge.com/wow/addons instead of the actual Twitch app so that you can sort by game version.
---
Rogues stealth around and oneshot them?
---
World Bosses would be dumb with that system, guilds would be able to kill multiple in same day if some "layer" would be uncontested

Can you say what to expect from every ping range? For example 1-60 ping great connection, 140-200 constant lag?

I used the [Github version](https://git.tukui.org/elvui/elvui-classic/-/archive/development/elvui-classic-development.zip) of ElvUI and just opened the zip-file.

The dude and his family alleged committed fraud with their construction company by billing cities in California for unfinished or completely undone work. They were eventually called out on it brought to court over it. They lost, accused the other side of racisim. They tried an initial appeal and had some success but ultimately they lost their case and ended up owning like a million bucks and the family construction company was banned from all work either in a city or all of California and then it was just dissolved.

For sure, I mean a addict level dose of H is gonna fuck someone with no tolerance up bad anyways. Add a upper onto it and your CNS just goes all fucky lol
---
Lol, so it's either don't play at all and miss launch, or play 8-12 hours a day? Come on. If you can't play 2 hours a night with a wife, kids, work, then that's on you. You can work, spend time with kids, spend time with wife, even lay with kids for bed time, and still get a solid 2 hours of game time if you want a decent night sleep. If you're a person that only needs 6 hours, then you can probably get 3-4 hours of sleep.
---
The only people that this doesn't count for are people with 1+ hour commutes, but this really isn't the norm imo.
---
Huh? The game is ready
---
Really ? do you have a PVP server? can you show me that??

I was on whisperwind ( day one wow server) we made a facebook group years ago to stay in touch and we all just decided to go on mankirk for classic. Going to be amazing to relive my childhood with the same ppl who I have so many fond memories of.

You won’t get blacklisted for killing a streamer.. you won’t even get blacklisted for killing a streamer for 30 minutes. You’ll get blacklisted if you do it for hours across multiple zones. This ideology that you’ll get blacklisted for simply WPvP is crazy, if you play the game normally with even some corpse camping you won’t get blacklisted. :)
---
It's still good, but it won't proc off of itself in this patch.
---
You are definitely correct in this one (if it even needs to be said) 
---
 "No way Blizzard allows them to take Grobb as their “streamer server”.  Due to the fact there is only 1, this is the server type most requested  to be added, and the backlash from the community if they tried this and  were allowed would almost kill their streams and Blizzard at that point."  
---
Is particularly humorous.  No, Streamers!  Don't all join Grobb!  You'll kill Blizzard!!!  O no!
---
A mans gotta do whatta mans gotta do
---
Erh? Don't think i follow you. It can very much have a negative social effect. A server should be 1 world, thats what makes the community aspect in classic so special.
---
Until people who are still on dialup in Slovakia try to raid with people on fios next door the server, then you'll see how great "together" is.
---
It's [Titan Panel Classic](https://willitclassic.com/view/QXNBU7kCzPuzNSlZeWBD). Not sure if there is some equal plugin in ElvUI, but mine is a separate one.

?
---
I'd recommend watching TipsOut's video on layering.  I think he makes a lot of good points as much as I hate him as a streamer. He goes over a lot of the flaws with all the alternate ideas people have.

Word name, easier to make a lasting impression with something simple, especially when you do your job well. Short so people are more apt to friend list you after a good run or two, to message you later for more dungeons.

I was under the impression Arms was far superior than Fury when it comes to pvp no?
---
Don't get me wrong, I barely read the OP's post; it was way tl;dr. IMO, if you want people to listen to you and see your POV, you've gotta make your posts here succinct. But no worries! I understand where the confusion comes from on both sides. I mean, we've all dealt with drive-by gankings (lol). It's when it goes on for hours or days or even weeks that it ruins the game and makes it un-fun.
---
I think by default people claim that it's what you get for rolling on a PVP realm, but the reality here is that it's an RP-PVP realm and there ought to be rules in place to encourage both sets of people to have fun. When either group can't play the game to enjoy it, that's when an intervention becomes necessary, and in the historical past of WoW, PVPers push RPers off the realm by disrespecting that aspect of the game. PVPers can *always* have fun playing (there are 60 zones to kill like-leveled players); but RPers can be griefed to excess because many RPers are 1) RPing while still lower leveled and/or 2) wearing white/grey gear to immerse themselves, making even 60s easy targets while they're RPing. If griefing RPers is the only way for a PVPer to have fun, they're on the wrong type of realm.
---
I hope GMs take this into consideration, especially considering it's just one RP-PVP realm for US and one for EU.
---
It's a milliseconds delay, so it's all a spectrum. I wouldn't play on a server with over 200ms. 150ms I would.

Over 100ms (.1 second) generally you will begin to notice it.

Did he steal 1 million dollars or did his father? I'm not exactly a lawyer but I'm pretty sure you can't be held accountable for the crimes of someone else just because you're related.

My favourite time in vanilla wow was when you could cast/channel an ability in shadowmeld. So I would sit around with my stealth panther in areas and aimed shot people out of shadowmeld or similar to this video, have it sitting in the open for people to attack and kill them without them knowing what even happened.

Thank you. This is the correct response
---
Realms tend to be either pretty balanced or completely lopsided. A server doesn't get to 65:35 or whatever and then stabilize there, it keeps flipping until it's like 90:10 and the only players left on the lesser side are little kids and ultra-casual dads who don't really do anything meaningful. People generally don't stick around on servers where their faction has totally lost the game, so being the minority by more than a few percent is really bad.

Just like the poker player whose hand is broadcast all over?

It honestly feels like half of all the streamers are entitled manchildren who never had to work a single day in their life. Also: Why play on a PvP-server if you don't want to get ganked? Are streamers retarded or what?

I learned that no one knows how to tag mobs for quests when surrounded by a dozen other players.

If your name is that common, it's probably not worth reserving.

So much casual hatred or racism of other countries going on in these posts. I don’t wanna play with spanish speakers,  poles are bad, svandinavians are intollerable, arabs and africans will ruin it all». It’s so weird! If you really can’t tolerate playing with other people, a public server might not be your thing.

Here's simple fix.

There is no "main layer."  There is the layer you are on, and layers you are not on.  Anything different is a bug.

I think you mean things like add tanking. Fury/prot combo was really good at it.

I mean people did that in Vanilla (not saying it was me stop accusing me) by having two accounts.

"Patch 1.11.0 (20-Jun-2006): Shatter applies to all of the mage's spell schools.

At the end of the day, noone is forcing them to broadcast their location. They can always turn off stream if they dont want to get sniped.

I have no issue with them playing on any server, my issue is with them bringing along their army of rabid fanboiz that will turn anything they touch into shit

I‘m already missing the nost server. If layering‘s that bad, i prefer 10k people on one server
---
I played Wyrmrest Accord from the east coast and never had a problem. Right now I'm in Central time so I have to pick a coast no matter what, but I'll probably roll east coast because that's where everyone else I know lives. XD
---
Will you be choosing to roll on an EST PVP server or the RP one?
---
You can still grief on the same faction. Tagging mobs, fearing mobs, etc.
---
You won't take it for raiding, but it's great for pvp (frost nova -&gt; frostbolt + cone of cold shatter combo) and also leveling.
---
No, somewhere near California I think are the culprits
---
I wouldn’t mind playing on a server with Esfand’s, Madseason or Crendor.
---
Nope this main tank
---
All classes, except for warrior, are great for beginners. It takes a lot of time to get to max level. You'll learn all about your class in the mean time from playing and from other people.
---
Here's a tip -&gt; Hunters, druids, and warlocks are the FASTEST at solo leveling
---
Warriors and paladins and Paladins are the SLOWEST at solo leveling 
---
the others are in between.
---
probably dominos, bartender wasnt working on the stress test from what I saw
---
Because it's so awesome being names Deathangel or Cowbullhoof
---
Or if you, you know, log out. But hey, let's ignore three things which actually happen frequently on a continent-wide scale when it means we can complain about layering.
---
You can play on the German server with an English client. I've done this for years.
---
You’re confused cus ur a moron

That's a shame because you aren't getting that. Sometimes, you have to look on the bright side rather than just complain about everything that is "wrong" with the game.

You're not supposed to be able to learn any professions until level 5. This is a bug.

What do you mean of any hybrid class?

Shatter is arguably the most powerful pvp talent in the game and it basically defines the frost pvp spec.

None of technical aspects even matter.  The cost of hardware or cloud computing units is absolutely infinitisemally smaller than the costs of development and operations.
---
People commenting on Blizzard "skimping" to save money on data center costs just have no goddamn clue about this shit.

Yep

I have zero tolerance for imbeciles
---
I agree, but I’ve heard arguments against this style claiming that they’re unoriginal or lazy. Ultimately it comes down to what you prefer though.
---
I mean it's better for more than just Stam. Though ferals are the spec where weapon matters the least out of everyone in the game. Was there a healer staff? I don't remember. I do remember that the staffs were exceptionally ugly for alliance though
---
To be clear in Vanilla you could do this with two accounts.
---
It never amount to a problem other than a handful of specific instances, but you could always do this in some capacity.
---
They need to bring the rpg back into the mmo in retail. Classic feels so great because they didn’t make every class the same. Everyone doesn’t have a stun everyone doesn’t have a heal, etc each class is unique
---
i havent paid for WOW in a long time. I went to post on the classic forums to meet old people and I noticed none of my old characters appear for me to select from to post (because ive been unsubbed for so long??)
---
My question is, when i go to renew my sub, it shows all 3 of my old accounts. I used to have 3 wow accounts then merged them all into my bnet. Its asking me to renew my sub on 1 of the 3 account in my bnet. Problem is, I dont know which account has the characters I want to post with.
---
Is there a way to know which characters are on which wow account? Does resubbing on 1 account activate all 3? Or would I have to guess which one to resub on?
---
Dude asked you for the difference and you glossed over that one to attack him somewhere else lol
---
&gt; What would the purpose of mentioning hibernate be, since it only targets beasts and moonkin. 
---
That's a utility spell that doesn't have anything to do with any of the three specs and their performance. 
---
&gt; Or Scare Beast. 
---
Also utility.
---
&gt; Or Shackle Undead?
---
Useful CC, but again, utility.
---
&gt; Saying a Priest possess no inherent cc outside of Psychic Scream is a straight up lie,
---
Also not required for them to function OR to be able to do the roles as listed on these guides.
---
&gt;  just like neglecting vital parts of a paladin's spell repertoire.
---
Not even the same thing as the above could be removed and no appreciable change be noticed in how those classes play. Consider too that the spell you mentioned is only useful in very limited context, and is not even worth mentioning for a guide like this. 
---
&gt; Unlock their potential at the start? Warriors are infamous for needing good gear to fight equally levelled mobs all the way
---
Gear is another topic, but we are on the topic of abilities. Warriors get taunt, aoe, and multiple threat tools at level 10. So do Druids, but to a lesser extent. Paladins do not. No taunt (ever), no aoe abilities (unless you go consecration 11pts holy), and only auto attacks and judgement otherwise. 
---
&gt; If you completely ignore context I can see why you'd place prot pally's last
---
That is what you are doing. 
---
&gt; The game, however, is not that hollow.
---
Play prot paladin and level as one. Then you'll understand.
---
Nerd
---
He hopped on avoid streamer discord last night. Pretty chill dude.
---
hybridclasses are classes that can fit into more than once role. like a druid: he can heal, tank, melee dps and range dps
---
What is with the title? Cross REALM\*\*\*\*\* (So sorry)
---
What does that have to do with anything? If you're remaking the thread, just remake it without a confusing apology note in the title.
---
Because it made sense lore-wise and was neat/cute mechanic.
---
this is why there is such a divide between wow players and streamers and before I say anything I'm not playing on their server. First of all a gank is a gank anyone who has ever played WoW and wants to continue to play on a PvP server knows what that is. A stream snipe is when you watch someone stream find their exact location and use that to fuck with them repeatedly, if you are one of those people and continuously stream snipe I don't care imo you deserve a black list. Ganking is something organic and entirely different.
---
I know some try hard people back in the day that had a second account specifically for trash talking the opposite faction when someone. Haters are going to hate anyway.
---
Why, when saying that it's easy to spot stream snipers, did you use a extremely rare event that no opposite faction player would ever stumble upon as an example? Of course them getting jumped in some obscure corner of their capital city means they got stream sniped.  
---
If Soda gets ganked while he's afking in the middle of the ocean while stealhed, yeah, he got stream sniped. But what if he gets ganked while killing panthers in STV? How exactly would to go about showing that he did in fact get stream sniped?
---
We made the game you cunt.
---
He's the only streamer with the balls to post here, haha.  That says a lot.

You are wrong.
---
Idk if I would call it waste of money but I wouldn't be happy. I want a persistent world, not instanced etc. That is why I came here.

Agree re the orange and red quests - I had a crack once and got absolutely smashed. Won’t waste my time with that again! I enjoyed just cruising around also. Won’t be any rush this time around

Yep, those uber RP/fantasy names make me cringe.

Why would it be forced to zone people out if the Layer is capped at such at level that the server could handle all of those players being concentrated in one area simultaneously and refused to move new people to the Layer, instead outputting an error that target Layer is full, you will be transferred at the earliest opportunity?
---
Yes that’s a joke meant to highlight the gratuitous use of political character assassination in recent years
---
This is totally fine. More communication isn't a bad thing. Make friends with those people in your bgs

---
You are suggesting that they provide options as a work around for a bug. It isn't supposed to split up your group, that's the point. Fixing that bug would provide the same exact thing your suggestion does.
---
True lol
---
I didn’t really have any negative experiences with it tbh. Maybe an empty ironforge from time to time but there seemed to be enough people around in the leveling zones to make it competitive for mob kills
---
Stream sniping is literally banned on twitch (if two broadcasters do it to each other for example). Yet you argue that it's somehow innocuous and the dude's just a sucker for showing his "cards".
---
Seems like we won't agree on any of this either way.
---
Now if US understood this with their gun laws.. :D
---
What a shit post. It definitely is not meaningless.
---
If you follow streamers like this, you are actually pathetic.
---
This isnt really accurate since this is the moment when he was calling for raid invites to his layer while they fought omar in stormwind during one of the stress tests. 
---
This many people arent gonna be running around asking for invites to his layer while he watches youtube vids on stream.
---
Even assuming the best of intentions I think this is a dreadfully bad idea on his part. I couldn't even guess how many folks I've met online, in games or otherwise, who I knee-jerk thought were being dicks but turned out to just be regular dudes when I got to talking to them.
---
What is the best racial for an alliance priest only looking to play Shadow and mainly WPVP. I’m leaning NE due to shadowmeld shenanigans with a rogue friend of mine, but curious others thoughts!
---
Complaining about being split up from your group as if it's a feature of layering is retarded. You are suggesting they scrap the entire system because of one bug. Having occasional glitches is far from being broken. I have had zero issues, and I group up all the time. I haven't heard a single person in my guild, general/trade chat, or party members complain once. 
---
Calling someone a shill because they think it's a bad idea for Blizzard to scrap an entire system because it occasionally bugs is hilariously stupid. I've had zero lag this stress test, and have disconnected once. If layering has had a role in that, then I love it.
---
Layers are per continent, so yes layer "player" had just a few in that small area we could see but tells us nothing of the layers population.  
---
Besides I am sure there is a hard rule that the player joining a group moves layers regardless of layer populations, whats more distruptive one player moving layers or 39 other players?  Imaging getting 40 players together inviting randoms from char how many times would everyone move layers during the process if it were based on layer population of the player joning.
---
Hakurai has some YouTube vids going over it. He seems to be the dungeon leveling guy.
---
Layering working as intended
---
fwiw I barely edited a thing, I just took out a line at the end regarding potential responses to this post because it wasn't relevant and formatted it a bit better to make it easier to read. :)
---
And yet people still act surprised when many want to stay the fuck away from these fanboys and the streamers
---
That's why i shows the /who-list in that picture. I get that it will not be as full as it will weeks after release - but it should be way more populated than you can see here.
---
Not anymore. Pot away. Its on me if I didn’t come prepared.
---
The people calling out Ret for not doing enough dps are the same people who have no idea how classes worked in Vanilla. Ret was insanely good in PvP but yes, it was more of a support class in PvE. People didn't bring for their dps.
---
What popular wow pvp video had this song? I know I've seen it before, but I cannot recall where to find it and it's killing me lol.
---
Oh...
---
who list also has a limit
---
I’m fully aware of that. Hence fix being in quotations. In this case I’m referring to the npc layer as the main one as it’s blizzlike in that it has npcs.
---
yes, but in runescape this isnt seen as an issue. Some mining veins can take minutes to respawn, and there if you keep hopping worlds you get a cooldown.
---
With raidbosses surely you would still have instance locks that spread across all worlds within that server?
---
The bosses in RFC are level 16 elites, so the lower level you are the better gear you'll want to mitigate all the crushing blows you'll be hit with.
---
Being 1 or 2 levels higher with max defense skill makes a huge difference.
---
It's also more understandable IMO because there was no PVE option for people on private servers so some people got opted into it without really wanting  it.
---
I'd agree except I've been on private servers like that and it sucks partying up with someone to do a dungeon and then you realize you can't communicate with this person because he's from Russia and he keeps pulling even though he's a hunter and I'm just trying to tank
---
I found all the songs from Tony Hawks Pro Skater 2 to be ace
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/atlaslootclassic/files
---
Different games.
---
World hopping is massively abused in OSRS which would completley alienate vanilla players. OSRS do not have set communities of allies and opposite faction people that you constantly meet and know very well. Basically OSRS has only one gigantic community where as wow has always been smaller close knit communities.
---
How does game time function? Is it the same as retail or are there separate counters? Is there a way to get one day so I can reserve a name?
---
Asmon has said he's making horde and alliance PvP characters.  So basically, trying to get away from the streamers is futile.  
---
I blame Blizzard for not opening more servers, but at this point, you're just going to have to live with the celebrities of Azeroth.
---
Very important that you not feel dumb
---
Yeah it looks absolutely miserable. Also occurs to me that new players who haven't been keeping up to date with information about classic aren't going to know about layering and are going to get to the big cities, find them empty and assume that is just normal... or that the game just isn't popular.
---
Blizzard may have put layering in place because they think a load of players are going to quit and that may make sense... but at this rate layering is going to be the thing that makes loads of players quit.
---
I'm trying to imagine what playing vanilla would have been like back in the day if all the cities had &lt;10% the normal number of players when I was just starting out and I'm thinking I might not have got into it in such a big way.
---
The reddit/classic pops aren’t the only people who will play long term.
---
Hope you reported this bug ingame too
---
Is there not a lock on how many times you can actually get loot from rares in a day though? This would be spread across all shards/layers/worlds within a server.
---
Imagine comparing someone who's on reddit to someone who's trying to gatekeep a group of people out of their server.
---
I said goddamn! goddamn
---
I know it will , i said if they leave it for longer than release duh do you even read why respond
---
No, this is layering. There actually are many people there and you can't see them. I noticed the exact same thing and noticed it also in crossroads. It inspired this comment:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/covqj1/i_just_got_layered_and_forced_to_start_a_new_group/ewlimg4/
---
Wand weaving kind of works for walking (very clunky), but wands reset the melee timer so wand+melee weaving doesn't.
---
Warlock is extremely newbie friendly, hunter as well if you can make it to level 10 without tearing your hair out (level 9 is a bit of a hump for them.) You can pve and pvp in the same gear for the most part with either of them. Shaman has a little more nuance as far as talents and totems if you're looking for some challenge, but playing one is fairly straightforward. Feral druid is super simple with bear or cat form and there isn't really a bad talent choice for them, but getting groups will be a pain.
---
Yeah runescape is made for things like world hopping, and even then it's still massively abused. And world bosses would be a complete nightmare.
---
Stress tests.
---
Thanks for the complete answer mate ! Yeah we will both be undead, I guess we’ll see how crowded it is on release but since I will be playing on a French realm I don’t really now yet how many people will play, might be a lot, might be not !
---
Dwarf Priest is always BiS
---
What do you mean 1 week? The video claims the kill was April 25th, 2005. MC released in November of 2004.
---
Oo wow, humans like interacting with other humans?!?! Who would have thunk it? 
---
I have been saying this for years and people say no community isn’t why vanilla was so good...
---
yep
---
Indeed - def had that corpse run once lol
---
So I’ve been a keyboard turner for years and tried using my mouse in the stress test, but I’m apparently an idiot. I don’t get it, do people only use the mouse? If so, how? Any videos that can dumb it down and show me? I’m more of a visual learner. Thanks.
---
So, what’s the understanding that people aren’t going to play? WoW at its base is an MMORPG that seriously has everything that any other MMO being released this day and age has. Maybe the QoL isn’t as good, but are you saying that people will quit because they want their QoL stuff back?
---
I seriously can’t believe that people from retail will quit in droves. This is such a Boomer comment and it drives me nuts. “The younger generation can’t handle no QoL improvements in Classic. They’ll leave because they are soft.”
---
Can someone explain to me the situation regarding steamers?  Also Wtf is layering.
---
But I think blizzard is correctly assuming that in a month or 2, server population will drop massively. So it's kinda a catch 22. If they double the number of servers, in 2 months ogrimmar will be empty because no one is on your server. But with layering you can have a mid pop ogrimmar now and in 2 months
---
Dude got probably ganked 400 times on Beta. Did he call for a ban on people every time he got killed? Hell, no. He knows the game and how it works. Considering his popularity even the tolerates the stream sniping out of necessity most of the time.
---
It's not like he's the sole arbiter of anything in Classic. If whoever is part of that blacklist agrees, that the person stream sniped, he's on it.
---
I love how people argue that nobody has the right to create a blacklist, because it "influences their experience" yet defends something that does influence someone else's experience to a much larger degree.
---
I also gave two examples, you just picked the one you felt was easier to attack.
---
What i described isnt pvp its griefing.
---
I'm not sure if you're calling me salty or the streamer but I'd be willing to bet every dime I have that you've absolutely lost your shit on a game at least once in your life to a degree that makes Venruki's reaction in the video look like a Buddhist monk.
---
Dunno about modern game but in classic it 100% flags you
---
I understand that.  Did you run out and meet all of those players?  Org is a big place.  Just because they were not right in front of you doesn't meant they weren't there.
---
I get the point you are trying to make, but you are maybe slightly misrepresenting it.
---
That's amazing. I am in awe of your power my lord.
---
At least they are making a mega streamer server.  There's only 5 pvp servers imagine if they spread out and there was no avoiding them.
---
You're lying, but it's okay. Done responding to someone baiting for sympathy.
---
I thought BGs were cross-realm so isn’t your point about queues moot?
---
I get that, this is talking about still having separate servers, just with a few layers on each at first to support more players/eliminate super crowded zones.
---
OSRS clans are not as big a deal as wow guilds and the playerbase is alot smaller, thats why i was interested in peoples thoughts.
---
So... Shouldn't blizzard see this and just out right ban him? Anyone live streaming deserves to get stream sniped. Anyone not adding a delay to their stream DEFINITELY deserves to be stream sniped
---
Blacklisted? Aw man!
---
Take a look at the video that was posted on here the other day:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3LoEIpy1dU
---
jesus I'm upset I watched even 30 seconds of that I never wanted to know this mustachio'd dipshit existed.
---
If it is, banned on twitch im perfering, its not in wow, which is where soda wants to do his own brand punishing.
---
What time does Wow classic launch? I see it just says August 27th but people said in America it actually comes out the 26th. Is it a midnight release on the 27th?
---
Okay so what about when new servers is released? Will we be able to premake characters for that? What about those initial servers, won't they have a massive amount of created characters from players who have no intend of playing there because they swapped to one of the newer servers? Seems pretty silly to me.
---
Yeah i think this is the biggest thing i originally missed, its just not a problem in osrs.
---
60/40 is fine? not considered unfair?
---
And on you if you want to spend a portion to (maybe) win:)
---
Is that really going to happen with so few servers though?
---
How is Asmongold a dick?
---
Something that has to do with butt holes for me.
---
Because that's not what NPCs do. When you roleplay you are effectively pretending to be an NPC, albeit with more personality and deeper interaction with other "NPCs". That's the most simple way of putting it. 
---
Corpse camping, or even the process of repeatedly killing someone over and over, is explicitly a player activity and a result of game mechanics.
---
This is the sort of thing the anti-RP death squads used as their defense, despite it making no sense if you stop and think about it for half a second. It's not immersive to be killed over and over and over. It's not immersive to do the killing over and over. It's game mechanics. If corpse camping was a thing in universe then why doesn't every NPC that dies in lore just run back to their corpse as a ghost and come back?
---
Exactly. Same thing here. I have had awful players on my team who i thought were just deliberately trolling or griefing and i message them after game to learn they are just new or something, then proceed to talk about what they could do better. I was also gonna mention how there is no way you can prove someone is stream sniping. Too many streamers seem to jump right to that conclusion
---
What? This is first time I heard of something like that.
---
I really can’t understand why people play this game to follow asmongold around. How are they so enthralled by him?
---
I'm having the exact same issue, except there are players.  None of the players I can see can see any NPC's, but grouping with a player that can see them fixes it.  Wasn't an issue last night but it has been all day today.
---
Just checked around, I can see Sylvanas and the NPC's in her area and the hall leading to her area
---
Action bar is the things with your skill buttons.
---
Did you mean unitframes? The one that shows the bar with your/targets HP/Mana/Name etc?
---
Simple, take out the sheep herder and they all scatter.
---
I'm sorry, I enjoy Asmongold's content I see on YouTube, but that is too hard for me to accept without evidence. The money, I mean.
---
It's basically like how people obsess about other celebrities like singers.  Look at how they get swarmed when they go out in public, this is pretty much the same thing.  I realize it's a game but these people feel like they are interacting with someone famous so makes them feel special.
---
Right, but the point is there are *at least* 50 people in Orgrimmar and you can only see perhaps seven of them. Try it for yourself, run around the whole town and take a head count. This is caused by layering. There are people in this screenshot and you can't see them.
---
I have.  and there is a raid group pulling people onto THEIR layer.  This is not soley the fault of layering.
---
I'm not dumb enough to do so
---
Why can't I play hunter as human?
---
Yeah we've done some extensive testing and find the ping is usually doubled on west coast for us in the range of 75-80 while we get 35-40 on eastern. We'll likely be choosing an eastern server, but there is a chance we go western if Asmon or soda split up and there are large streamers on multiple east coast ones. In that case there's a good chance we'd choose good old Grobbulus
---
I just get "Request timed out" 4 times in a row on either IP address. Tried with Powershell and Command Prompt
---
When does the stress test end? 
---
Roughly every 5-10 seconds on Friday.
---
Right click hold to move the camera, and then W will take you forward in that direction. Keep practicing :).
---
Think of your character like an extremely fast snake, you can only move forward, but you can change directions rapidly.
---
Tuesday at 3pm you can reserve a name.
---
do you not kinda phase between the layers without actively choosing though? Like in bfa ore just magically dissapears as you are about to mine and stuff like that and you never see the same players.
---
My man. It's not a WoW ban. Nobody is getting banned from WoW over being on a blacklist. Hell, the chances of half the server not giving a shit about a blacklist is much higher than the opposite scenario to begin with.
---
"Worst" case scenario: you were being a twat and face some consequences for it.
---
Video from the other day:
---
Every reason to suspect that there are likewise plenty of people around in this screenshot and you just can't see them.
---
Scholo’s cap was 5 at the time tier 0.5 was added to the game.
---
I like the way you think.
---
Am I the #nochanges person?
---
Increased since when? Vanilla? Wrath? The start of BfA? 8.1?
---
Yes actually. Because thats how he gets an income.
---
Why is this an issue? GW2 has this cross server function and it's funny.  Ya'll so soft
---
We're definitely confusing each other on something. If someone takes issue with someone else, goes to a different server and is there able to message that person cross-server and cross faction, that's when the issue arises in terms of rage messaging etc. As for the community aspect, the factions being able to easily talk to each other ingame is precisely not an intended part of the design for good reason and should also be avoided.
---
I haven't heard anything about Faerlina being taken over by Spaniards. Isn't Thalnos the one that's being taken over?
---
Ok so exactly 0 questions have been answered got it.
---
Little cameo from Timthetatman over four years ago lol
---
Idea: Could we get a default minimum bid slider? Currently each item starts at 70 and we take it down to 5 each time.
---
Then you prove you have no idea what you're talking about in regards to twitch and youtube money, there are plenty of sites where you can put in the channel and find out what their revenue should be
---
Can you answer a question specific to this comment thread though? How would what that other guy described cause naming issues, for example - if it’s from the same server
---
Ya'll so soft looool
---
No it doesnt happen a lot, so you DONT know math. Ive played on a PVP server on the horde side ever since i started playing this game back in 2005, solid argument.
---
Can it happen SOMETIME, that he hearthstones to another zone and the ganker doesnt find anyone else to gank so he change to the same zone by accident, yes it can definitely happen, but if you claim it happens "a lot" you have zero understanding in probability.
---
Nope wasn't me. Can't same I'm surprised though. Try making your arguments without name-calling.
---
Yes, you are. If you are doing any of that in a group, if you get layered, it is a bug.
---
Ok so my question still stands. Is it possible to get 1 day of game time so that I can reserve names
---
Faerlins for life. Herod is where the streamers are going, and Thalnos is where the BR are going.. so that leaves only Faerlina for any normal player.
---
Going rogue in classic. I've been debating whether going skinning plus herbalism, then changing into alchemy, or skinning with mining then changing into engineering. I'm as interested in PvP as I'm in PvE, that's why I can't decide.. alchemy for the potions and raid pots, or engineering for pvp? Since engineering is so crucial for PvP aswell, but at the same time alchemy is a life saver both within raids and with gold making since rogue isn't the best class to farm gold with.
---
Anyone, please put up pros/cons for me for either choice. I seriously can't decide. I've probably listened to over 10 YouTube videos with tips and profession guidance, but all the guides is.. overly genuine? Like "this is good for that, and that is good for that, so both is good!" But none, of what I've found actually compares them. Anyone with some guidance that's reality based? Thanks!
---
true. just make more realms and if a realm dies just offer free transfers or merge it. i really hope this layering doesnt fuck up the game... we waited for this wayyyyy too long
---
Play night elf, shadowmeld on rachet boat, mind control hordies off of boat into fatigue waters. 1v1 master. GG EZ.
---
Can't streamers just create their own chat channels?
---
Ye its possible it was like that on legion, just on stress test I killed 15+ rares in elwyn forest (same one multiple times, gnoll for bags, that human rogue for that dagger and spider in a cave)
---
When they said they were adding spell batching, they were actually referring to chat. Common misconception.
---
It wouldn't. But thats one of many issues
---
Mine is similar, really noticable lag between pressing enter and seeing the chat box respond
---
Play mage
---
Yeah it's a waste of both players money to pot for duels. Save that for BGs and open world pvp
---
Yeah, but even trying that I think the chances of getting their desired names is pretty slim.
---
First time I've seen it. /shrug
---
This was how everything I read originally described it. I believe the instanced zones being referred to are the continents themselves. It may have changed, but the entire point and difference from sharding was to have continental shards instead of zone shards. 
---
The problems are how you handle people wanting to join a full layer without booting people currently on that Layer, how well the server actually handles a mass concentration event (always a problem with any coherent world plan), how to prevent hopping abuse, and what to do with low pop/near empty layers with a handful of persistent players (gatherers). Still problems, but relatively minor. 
---
For personal anecdotes, I wasn't noticeably phased at all while playing on the stress test. I did experience people in general who were on a different layer than I was and was unable to see them, which was kind of annoying. 
---
I'm fairly confident they tested some new sharding design which is being scaled up as the foundation for Layering in 8.2 retail. In the new zones, with PvE at least where faction balance doesn't really matter, I've experienced zero sharding in hours of camping a few rares, with raid markers on other mobs to confirm I haven't been phased
---
Do you even understand the issue. The whole issue is that it happens while you are playing.  People who play WoW don't log out very often.... areas are going to be overpopulated while you are playing.
---
I feel your pain.
---
You said if they leave layering in... Not if they leave it longer than release. 
---
Do you even read? Or write? Or communicate with words properly?  Why act like a douche? Oh. Cause you are.
---
You are aware, yet you still argue.  Nice doublethink my friend.  I too, love Big Brother.
---
Ok - so what types of community issues would merging shards down the road bring?
---
I'd rather deal with +30-40 ping than no wpvp
---
Spelladin might end up being very competitive for those that want to tryhard. Someone on the paladin discord was testing it out in naxx and he was #1 DPS on most fights. I'm going to try it out myself to see how effective it is in classic compared to pservers.
---
I had a gnome named Plugbutt.
---
Sounds like a very Golemagg thing to say.
---
Maybe I'm wrong, but I wouldn't step foot into a dungeon as a bear until 15. I'm not against MotW buff being taken first (because it'll obviously help), but I'd probably just head straight down the feral tree to get some things to help keep me alive, especially if you intend to feral tank through Classic.
---
The issue with bears is that they soak up damage like a sponge, versus deflecting damage the way a warrior would do. That means the healer REALLY has to be on their a-game and paying attention (no dpsing, honestly), and DPS need to learn to prioritize kill. **As the tank, it is your job to point the DPS at the correct target, so I highly suggest a macro/keybind for at least 'skull' that you can press to encourage them to focus down one target at a time.** 
---
Think about it this way: if you have three mobs attacking you and they each take 1 minute to kill...
---
* If your dps kill one at a time, then after one minute you only have two attacking you, and in two minutes you only have one attacking you. If the mobs do 400 dmg a minute, then you're taking 1200dmg for the first minute, 800 for the second minute, and only 400 for the last minute.
---
* If your dps are each focusing down different mobs, and they die around the same time, you were taking the damage of three mobs for the full three minutes, so going by the 400 per mob idea, that's 1200 damage for three full minutes.
---
In the first case, the lesser damage gives your healer a break, and lets your cooldowns come back online for when you need them later. Obviously at 13 you're not blessed with cooldowns, yet, but at higher levels this becomes more important.
---
TL;DR: I highly recommend making a little macro/keybinding skull to help direct the dps to focus down targets. I think it'll help you a lot and above are the reasons why!
---
Im still waiting your answer on that stealth tho, explain how a person can know EXACTLY your position in stealth? Literally run away from a ganker with a mount a looooooooong ass distance, hide in stealth to eat, and the ganker knows EXACTLY your location while you are in STEALTH, explain how that happens? Are you acting ignorant on purpose or are you ACTUALLY that ignorant?
---
Here's what I don't understand about layering. When Blizzard used it for the first beta tests it was stated it was just for the 'starting zones'. Now Blizzard is saying it's going to 'go away', but without any specific information. Everyone starts off at level 1. For those who don't quit you will move to the next zone, and then the next, and then next, etc...
---
Isn't it very likely you will be layered all the way to 60? Doesn't that take away from the original vanilla server-only experience? If Blizzard removes layering after 2/3/4/5/6 months what does it matter if you already leveled up to 60? There's not dailies in vanilla.
---
This was reported in 2010....I actually made a new character around 2010 after taking a hiatus since 2006. I remember it....zones were dead, no one to level with. It was a solo RPG.
---
Yeah, I made it to level like 9-15? And quit. 
---
I seriously can’t believe those numbers will be that high with an alive world and tons of people to interact with.
---
Come on dude. No need for that in this subreddit. We have to deal with politics enough on Reddit as it is.
---
To me this distinction is meaningless.  In a group or not, I shouldn't be layered away while I'm clearing some mobs, so that I have to clear the mobs again.
---
(Apparently) hard to swallow pills: People enjoy different things and as long as they aren't hurting anyone else you should let them do that.
---
You didn't think this one through, did you?
---
Ping would be a huge drawback. If I were you I'd try to suck it up and stick with EU servers.
---
It’s so cringe seeing assgold and guys like this just asking for gold and some scrub giving it to them. Screw streamer servers and screw people who support these douche bags.
---
yes
---
Yeah you do have a point there really aren't many servers
---
We don't yet know how crowded the servers will be.
---
English servers will be english speaking. Hell you are more likely to run into non english speakers on NA than on ENG eu, because of south americans or french canadians or some shit. 
---
Again same as before.
---
Whats the story behind the  meme "windfury thunderblessed" or something like that I hear ppl mentioning it all the time
---
I cant find the link. His wasn't a video, but said something to the extent of everyone in the guild he was in was required to post a screen shot at 6 hours of played time where they were a minimum of level 15 despite the fact he himself took longer than that to hit 15 and having never played vanilla WoW before.
---
During a play session, yes. But not everyone's play session is identical, especially continent wide.
---
Play ret paladin
---
It depends on more than sheer numbers. The last major private server was like 48/52 or something, but 80% of the community's hardcore PvPers rolled together on alliance and made a concerted effort to curbstomp the horde from the very beginning, to the point where the server's PvP scene was basically dead on arrival. I don't just mean alliance wanted to win fights, I mean they made it a project to prevent horde from playing the game. That'll kill a server much faster than numerical faction imbalance will. Given the amount of hype for Classic and the insane levels of pre-planning going on, I'd say servers are in much greater peril from that front than from lopsided numbers. 
---
Once phase 1 is over and layering has to be removed, Blizzard will presumably open a lot of new realms for migration and take measures to ensure that these servers get a roughly equal amount of warm bodies; but if a couple of big, hardcore PvP guilds pick the same server and faction while none choose the opposite side, that server will be doomed from the start. It'll be like if Real Madrid showed up in the park and fielded their strongest starting XI against a group of random kids, and did everything they could to make those kids give up on football. I expect a lot of players to grow really disillusioned with Classic once they realize how seriously certain guilds will take it, to the point where they only feel like winners when they've dominated so hard that others give up on the game.

This is how I feel. An MMO used to be an immersive experience. Layering is constantly reminding people it's a video ass video game.
---
Never claimed you to be, but it's the reason why Spell batching exists in it's current state. 
---
It is also why melee leeway is as it is, because people advocated for there to be no changes.
---
To go even further, it is also why Layering exists. You can argue night &amp; day whether layering is better/worse than sharding, but layering wouldn't be a thing if it weren't for #nochanges advocation.
---
When you go to war for something, you need to live with the consequences, good or bad.
---
“The BR”?
---
No, you could always learn gathering professions at 1 in vanilla. Only crafting you have to be 5 for
---
really nice idea but holy shit it took like 2 mins before the stylesheet even applied to the page haha
---
Right?
---
But the second you suggest that layers be locked, and you should be forced to choose layer after picking server (still allowing you to pick same layer as friends) you get insta-downvoted.
---
Blizzard has one shot at this and they are shooting themselves in the foot.
---
The *entire reason* WoW was a hit is because *it was one giant seemless world. 
---
Layering is the antithesis to what made WoW great.
---
On the other hand, a lot of modern players are going to check it out because its free with their sub anyway.
---
Retention is going to be extremely low among them.
---
I'll see you there.
---
I don’t think that’s fair. I’m not an RPer - in that RPing isn’t my goal or interest - at all really. But I know that I’m joining an RP server and I need to respect that. I plan to do light RPing when interacting with those that are clearly into it. Simple stuff like emoting, /yelling for help when getting ganked, responding to others yelling for help, etc. I’m definitely not going to bring a toxic attitude and in fact I’m really looking forward to playing with this community. I’m tired of modern gaming culture and playing on Grobbulus seems like a good opportunity to press the reset button on all of it.
---
Well I'm gonna order a video card soon that has the letters THICC in its name.. tee hee
---
For me, the principle that realms should be discrete worlds stands pretty strong, to the degree where I am willing to disregard a lot of other issues to maintain it. If a solution to a problem requires cross-realm stuff of any sort, I am willing to just let the problem persist instead of compromising realm "purity". As such, practical issues may have less of an impact on how I feel than you'd expect. I just want there to be 0 interaction between realms, regardless of the consequences.
---
For the record, my first level 60 was first on The Venture Co (Horde), and then later I switched to Lightbringer (Alliance) and got to 60 there, where I remained until I quit.
---
Something that sounds offensive when your guildmaster has to address you in discord. Like Kneegrow
---
I am not sure what you mean.  No one is actively wanting to move to a 'targeted layer'.
---
Yes everyone please leave Mulgore.  Mulgore is trash just don't go there, there is no reason to stay there and take away my mobs, I mean nobody would ever level in Mulgore.
---
They are completely different situations.
---
The most popular game and MMO where all MMOs are still being based off of being called a niche game. LOL!
---
Oh boy. Do you work for Blizzard?
---
Stone form is Bleeds, Diseases and Poisons (Remember that Blind is a Poison in Classic).
---
This game is a fucking joke already, jesus. I actually fully believed they wouldn't fuck this up, feel like I got duped
---
I dont think you understand how this game works. Its not just walk in a random direction and its a probability percentage if i run into the same person again. You need to seriously pull your head out of sodas butt.
---
ah gotcha. see there is a balance for being able to grind for drops, and not being able to farm too easily and i think that is independent of number of shards. that is something that can be changed with a drop% or a respawn time too.
---
but i didnt play classic first time round and respect that people want it the way it was
---
&gt; the legion of brain dead zombie kids that follow them.
---
It's weird for me, because you all say that the followers are the bad thing, the followers ruin the game for you, but yet the followers are legion kids who could never possibly play vanilla. How is a bunch of lvl 10's gonna annoy you after say 2 days of the server being up?
---
Frankly I won't wait around for them to remove it if it takes them til phase 2. The leveling and social world connectivity are the entire point of the game. Why would I even bother ruining my first experience with layering?
---
Brazilians
---
god what the fuck is wrong with those people
---
Definitely just gonna play EU for low ping.
---
That’s the laziest thing I’ve ever heard. All you have to do is shift click the item and it will copy to your macro. GL

I would add that mage mana gems and lock healthstones are fine, since they're part of the class kit
---
I believe the friends list will look the exact same as it does in retail. Ie: a list of everyone you are friends with the name of the game they are playing, who they are playing if in wow and the icon of the game.
---
How did you find that out?
---
I really hope they are investing there money and not blowing it. I have a really strong feeling streamers are fads not idols.
---
Kek
---
I also embrace overpopulated areas. Blizzard does not, Blizzard decides to add layering if an area is overpopulated.  This is the entire issue.
---
Wish I could. Enjoy!
---
Yet they where the first community to announce a swedish only server.
---
I will be adding a minimum bid section. But the addon does store every minimum bid you enter on a per item basis right now. So if you bid on an item once, it'll auto populate that minimum every time.
---
I fully admit my post is long, I felt I couldn't voice my concerns without elaborating on where they originated from, and I wanted to inform non-RPers why I and others I've spoken to feel this way.
---
If I just dropped a few lines about fears of griefing on an RPPvP realm I'd definitely get the "just roll on RPPvE" or "It's a PvP realm" responses, so I felt it necessary to explain why we played on an RPPvP realm in the first place, how it differs from a normal PvP realm and how we managed to maintain a community that was a blend of RPers and PvPers, two activities that are direct opposites (Co-operative v competative).
---
But you're correct. A few kills here and there are expected, the issue comes from dedicated anti-RP death squads who are all too gleeful to gank the shit out of people trying to use the realm after it's namesake, then duck behind the "It's PvP bro" or "Yes I'm roleplaying a psychotic night elf that doesn't say a word as they massacre an entire camp of Horde then dances naked on their bodies" defences.
---
We've always put up with griefing to some extent, but between PvP damage getting stupid high from Wrath and onwards and GMs becoming lazier and uncaring it developed into a problem so severe we mass abandoned the RPPvP realms, which to this day remain glorified PvP realms as a result.
---
There’s so many assumptions in this post is making my eyes cross.
---
I'm sorry, but *being tricked* is not the same as *letting something happen*. There was intent to deceive on the part of Blizzard, to an essentially captive audience, who trusted them. This is a deep ethical lapse on their part, and shouldn't be glossed over. That they're hardly alone in the practice -- they indeed have it down to a science -- doesn't excuse it.
---
Humanity at it's finest.
---
Yeah definitely. I assume it is doing this because Org shares a population with Durotar and as a starting zone it is probably packed but this looks like a fundamentally game changing experience for new players.
---
Then how does a Layer ever overfill?
---
And yes, people are. Whether it be their friends layer (grouping up), to kill a rare present on one layer but not another, or to join a streamer, there *will* be people trying to move to a specific layer.
---
One of you taking Skinning/gathering while the other takes the other gathering profession will probably net your duo the most money. This way you can track all nodes and won’t miss anything to gather. I was thinking the 2nd profession for the other person could maybe be Tailoring for all the extra cloth you find and some of the skinned leather too. Especially if one of you is playing a clothie as there will likely be some end game BoEs to look forward to and you can always sell bags while leveling for extra coin.

I don't really see that big of a difference between the Scandinavian countries, just about the same percentage of rotten apples.
---
No of course not.   I never disagreed with that.
---
But posting a picture of an area that most people have no reason to be in at the moment and saying that it's wrong is VERY misrepresenting.  If you post a similar screenshot a week or two after classic launches and it's still the same, then I will 100% agree with you.
---
I still don't understand the appeal of Asmongold. I never thought I could legit feel pure hatred for a person I never met even though he did nothing to me but that dude did it
---
So there is definitely a layer with bugged world spawns (no NPCs in UC), unsure if it's one or multiple. Several people I whispered had the same issue, and it was fixed by joining another layer. Pretty annoying for my first layering experience, lol.
---
You will have to finalize your character before securing name
---
No, first off there wont be a raid of players on their jock 24/7 or they simply wont be able to do anything in the game. Second of all there isn't much he can do to with PoM pyroing mages or rogues just deciding to ambush spam him in a group.
---
This isn't like retail where he can turn off Warmode or jump servers to avoid a gank and group with people across hundreds of different servers and also have players able to get to his location within seconds. On Classic him calling in people to come assist him getting ganked is going to take time. Time for people to go from Ironforge to Silithus without portals, that kind of time. And then there is just the fact that he cant really mitigate a group wanting him dead if there are enough of them and regardless of how much he fights back the other side still wins. If people want to make his experience miserable they absolutely can in ways not remotely possible on Live.

I know, I know, I might have to come up with a better solution, the page grew like this as it went. Even the text alone is 105 pages!

You are not wrong in my book. My book ain't blizz book tho.

So the item [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker] was an epic level raid reward. Because the name was so long, people would think it was hilarious to link it in trade chat. Other people could then shift-click the name to put it in their own chats. Sometimes you could get Thunderfury spam to go for hours.
---
Lmao "defending them". I'm saying layering has provided a clearly better experience for me, and I'd rather they fix the issues then scrap the system. There is no defending there. You are delusional.

Classic EU forum, people are talking about it in many threads. I was going trough each one when I was deciding on which server I'm gonna roll.
---
Lmao what?  How will giving players a 'do you want to be layered right now' button turn the server into a lagfest?  Most people who are in small groups or are afk at the moment wont care and will get layered and people who are doing community events wont get layered.

Shazzrah or Golemagg?

Correct!
---
I love buffing everyone on sight with my paladin. I even open my spellbook to buff lowbies with downranked buffs. Especially nice when druids, preists, and  mages buff you back.

Pretty assumptive tbh. I've heard they are already prepared to make more servers available if pops are too high. Blizz is greedy, but they arent really stupid. They wouldnt throw away sub money like that

What worked for me was just running 100yards away from him, run back and baam i can see him

A taunt plus the mana-from-being-healed ability from BC would skyrocket their viability. Still not up to Warrior levels for bosses, but almost definitely the best trash or 5man tank.

Fremdschämen.
---
No raid worth their salt is going to give a fuck if a streamer dislikes you.
---
Ultimately it's a spec you will probably have to clear with your raid leaders, as they might compare your spec to other priest healers in the raid
---
Oh you big heterosexual male, thanks for the advice
---
I think theyll be fine if they waste zero time. Get in and get the name. Id be happy with blizzard reserving their names if it meant they would tell us which server.
---
we have spell batching, lag will be there anyway
---
I fawkin het pikeys
---
&gt; basically no major issues were fixed. Most became worst. Some of the worst bugs were simply ignored, and devs gave us the excuse that they're the way things were in 2004.
---
elaborate will you? Oh wait you can't.
---
This looks amazing! I skimmed through a little bit of it and will definitely be reading the whole thing little by little. Bookmarked!
---
So would it be smart to reserve the name, and delete at some random point prior to launch to recreate the character?
---
Quicker groups
---
You misspelled dude
---
Hell not even laziness as much as just habit. Every time I afk'd in org on any of the tests it just happened to be in front of the AH by the mail box, even though I didn't do anything with the AH and had just trained a weapon skill on the other side of org I'd still just run back to AFK there out of habit lol.
---
But it doesn't take high amounts of skill to clear these raids. Pugging an anniversary event vs having an actual guild on voice is very different. Most dedicated guilds will be clearing MC in like 2-3 hours, the high skill ones will just speed through a bit faster.
---
are the streamers going horde?
---
Things might've changed but my experience back in 2005 in vanilla Wow as a constant bombardment of 'swe?!'

From the survey data it looks like we’ll have an even split. Horde is up ~2%

Not too shabby

It wouldn't because paladins are still shit, but that doesn't mean we should give them taunts.
---
They’ve given the stopping point of “Phase 2”. I wouldn’t think they would mention that layering will at least be gone by phase 2, if they never had any intention of allowing it *up to* Phase 2.
---
I loved that the emotes were universal, so you could still thank, dance, taunt or whatever.
---
Yeah I guess its all relative. Personally I just prefer the lowest ping possible when playing online games in general.

I play WoW just fine, so i'm not sure whats up with this
---
I agree. We gotta ask ourselves do we want classic forever 1.12 or should it go beyond. For me  the answer is clear: I want it to evolve within the context of classic WOW

Thanks.

Them not having taunt made them much different than warriors and filled a different niche. They were bomb at aoe tanking. Also they had much more versatility than warriors with bubbles,  heals and the ability to rez.
---
This is nothing like vanilla. This is a joke.
---
If you think your name is in contention enough to secure it in that way, sure.
---
there was a post a while back asking what the most asshole'ish thing we did in classic was.
---
I used to do this exact thing. 
---
Cheers mate, nostalgia enjoyed.
---
Oh no, those anonymous people you did not know disappeared !
---
This. Let the community decide if your ideas are good or not, and I'm sure some of them could give you an idea of what it would take to actually implement your ideas. Just because it's a great idea doesn't mean it's even possible. ;) You could also look into learning how to code addons yourself...if you're brave. ;P
---
Honest question (about current-day WoW, not how it was in vanilla): Does Blizz actually investigate every single report in time? If you report one person for one action but they have no other actions on their account, do they still investigate it? I'm not saying it's good or bad, but I could see them having something in place where it's not actually flagged for review until multiple people report.
---
The writing was on the damn wall the entire time. Lesser of two evils my butt.
---
I gave you proof, you counter with a made up narrative.  Why can't you just accept that you are wrong?
---
Layering is continent based splitting of servers to accomodate the launch period rush and dropoff of population, in order to ensure a healthy population post launch period. 
---
Could ask blizzard support to add some game time, I know they do that on occasion.
---
Really unlikely though. There's a reason they are making you sub to reserve names.
---
There are still faction controlled zones that are safe from pvp unless you're flagged.
---
P2 is 'the latest'. They only really want it a short time, but time will tell. I think there is too much worry over nothing
---
Uh.. What?  
---
Blizzard have very clearly stated Layering will be there for the initial release but very quickly disappear. So just fucking don't play until it's removed and you won't have to worry.
---
Jesus fucking christ.......
---
INCORRECT FUN PARAMETERS
---
Probably the sarcasm...
---
You should really just go away if you don't want to engage in civil conversations. Accusing people who you disagree with of astroturfing is not a good way to handle a discussion.
---
If only Blizz, a small indie developer, could afford more than 8 servers
---
Nope it has to be paid for in order to work.
---
Huh, very interesting response. I wasn't aware of a lot of this. I hope it goes better than you fear, but if not, it'll be good to be aware of this so that I won't wonder what's going on.
---
rly? So you can spam Arcane Explosion as a mage and not get being flagged?
---
No.
---
Well we will have Spanish server and one ruined by APES, so---
---
Streamsnipers and Streamers are turning out to be interdependent for their relevance. Tbh I would avoid a streamers server because it's the first server to die. Once the hype dies down and views are dropping. They will move on and so will all their sheep. The chill casual and hardcore players will be on a different server and you are left on a Barren Server that is only active if there is an event and ultimately the first to die after the timeline.
---
I guess you're right, that theres not much reason for players to be there right now, and therefore layering may not be to blame for it. We'll have to wait and see, but personally I wouldn't be surprised if Blizzard didn't make any exceptions in terms of layering big cities.
---
A stream where they spend 90% of their time corpse running is not a very entertaining or effective stream.
---
If you think streamers wont be frustrated being essentially locked out from playing the game because of counter streamer gank squads then you are mistaken.
---
Their overwhelming influence will drastically impact whatever server they are on.
---
Doesn’t matter if you know them or not.
---
Subhumans gonna sub. Imagine that there actually are people who pay to watch gross losers eat food and then try to talk with said food still in their mouth.
---
They would just bring another warrior most likely unless it’s naxx they’d bring another mage
---
I was writing a mod that worked on other players, but the call didn't work on NPCs, so I dropped it. Not sure it's possible
---
French and german dubbing are leagues from each other.
---
German dubbing is considered one of the best in the world. Yeah sure not everybody likes it because sometimes stuff gets lost in translation but when watching a show I don't want to read subtitles but I also don't want to rewind when I didn't understand a sentence at first because it uses some weird slang that I don't know. Thats why I watch shows and movies in german and I never watched a show where I was like "Holy shit this is some super bad dubbing". (Especially Animes have really good dubs in germany)
---
The actual irony!
---
Fucking love this hahah.
---
I do see your point, however the vast majority of speed runners take a hell of a lot more skill and timing than just smacking a one button rotation.
---
Downvote me all you want, but classic WoW is easy. There’s time investment that must be had, and later on the bosses get challenging, but it isn’t a technical masterpiece to be able to beat Rag. 
---
I’m sure most people just looked at the title without seeing the actual post. I should have worded it better. It’s not entirely without merit, but it isn’t as big a deal as some people say.

One less crybaby in Classic.
---
Post removed. It's negligible and literally nothing to worry about. 50% of the server is going to be in the same boat as you.
---
You best hope not, the Chad's on Shazzrah will fuck up any other server.

---
Yea, it sucks, but it's what we get.
---
People have dealt with jank and non-Blizzlike aspects for years on Private servers. I feel that, given a few weeks, once layering is removed, people will be so used to the spell batching that it just feels normal.
---
I remember it being like you survive long enough to call for back up in zone chat or defense. If it’s 1v2 or more you’re going to have trouble.
---
Unless you’re a resto Druid. In which case you end up tea bagging your ganker.
---
Staysafe as well
---
But you don't even get karma for self posts.
---
I'm fine with layering as I saw it this weekend. I also understand that it will diminish as players spread out more.
---
I work in Dev, and saying this on something where you don't have a clue about any of the source is straight 4chan 'don't actually know anything' nonsense.

Yes, a video of a person making a raid, so everyone was waiting around for the fun to start.  They were waiting because something was about to happen. Nothing is happening in org right now because the level cap is 15 and everything is going to be wiped in a day.  There is no incentive to trade, or bank stuff, cuz by tomorrow it won't matter.
---
You have the random events like in the aforementioned video, but that's it.  After everyone had their fun on the stress test opening day, the majority of people left are those practicing leveling routes or just messing around and exploring.
---
Like I've said to other people, this is a closed, stress test environment; not indicative of what it will be like after Aug 27.  Post another screenshot a week after launch and if it's the same, I'll agree with you 100%.
---
This is phasing, same shit happens on pservers, it’s to reduce server load. 
---
It sucks but it isn’t layering.

It's an hour for sure, even to alts.

Blizzard could do a lot to prevent it from happening by changing their stance on PvP gear. For those not aware, vanilla has two versions of the ranked sets. The second one was added in the very end of vanilla (Naxx patch), but for some reason that's the one we'll get from the start when the honor system comes online in phase 2. It's kinda like if they made T2.5 drop in MC; people would take raiding insanely seriously and the difference between raiders and non-raiders would be enormous for a really long time. That's what'll happen to the PvP scene.
---
Not until phase 1 completes
---
I saw that. Dudes a fucking noodle.
---
That sounds correct-ish but I'll be honest, I can't remember when they finally linked the ah's.
---
I can't see the goggles like at all. But thnx for the response.
---
Asmongold layer 57....home...
---
It's pretty easy to avoid PvP with a little bit of effort, most people are over exaggerating how bad it really is.
---
No thanks.
---
Good, dont ever play the game and shut the fuck up because they've said 10000 times it wont be there forever. Even with it, you couldnt kill a single thing in the starting zones due to crowding. Imagine release. It would be moronic for weeks.
---
It's literally what the article said.
---
&gt; Instead of balancing players around shards of zones and combining players from multiple realms, layering will allow realms to create a separate instance of themselves to balance their own population. However, unlike sharding once in a layer, players won't leave this layer in favor of a better one whenever they move or change zones, removing the awkward phasing present in retail. The only way to change a layer will be to enter a group, which will have all players from the group in the same layer.
---
At launch? No chance. You'll definitely have low pop servers shortly thereafter, though, once the nostalgia wears off.
---
I don’t plan to snipe streamers but if I happen to come across soda I will kill him and quote Morgan Freeman after
---
“Sit #GayRetards”
---
The moment my faith in blizzard was shattered into fine particles of dust was when the diablo 3 beta had a bunch of people saying "don't worry, this just seems stupid cause it's the very first act with super low level characters. It will definitely be 100x better when the full game is out".
---
Yeah because they haven't been working on this for 2 years or anything. If the game isn't ready, don't release it.
---
Don't worry. Blizzard knows best. You think you want immersion, but you really don't.
---
I'd imagine the vast majority of the population that quits in P1 won't even make it to level 60, either because they happened to have a sub for retail and wanted to try it out or for any other multitude of reasons. P2 wouldn't do much to bring these folks back.
---
Not that there won't be people returning for each phase, but they're not really part of the population decline that people are talking about.
---
Because I watched the videos on the channel he linked, and venruki had some salty ass responses. I feel like that was pretty clear-cut.
---
&gt; These are random people you will never see again.
---
That's the point. We should be able to see them again. In vanilla you got to know names. With sharding that wont happen.
---
I do like how everyone is putting words in my mouth regarding how fast I’ll level. I’m hitting 60 by week 2 and raiding by week 3. I’m not a super mega casual ultra carebear, I’m just saying that the world’s first isn’t as impressive in classic as it is in retail.
---
obvious lie.  They're describing a scenario in a video posted earlier.
---
Can you give us a few reasons why you want to play on a PVP server?
---
They also said we didnt want classic.
---
Oy you have a loicense for det grewp m8 ?
---
Because layering is the lesser of two evils when the other option is most areas being completely unplayable during prime hours for months, or 2-4 hours queues.
---
Wait, so if you were a streamer you'd just accept the harassment? Like, oh well, guess I'm gonna be spawn camped for a bit.
---
A group of like 3 players can spawncamp 10k+ viewers. I'm sure that even if the streamer didn't want help, they'd get it. What's the problem with being proactive? Once people show you their colors, that reputation will follow them around and, for those in their faction that want to pk, make them great targets.

---
Lol, did you miss the part of the movie where Vincent buys heroin, heats it with water on a spoon and then injects it into his veins?
---
Thats a terrible idea, because most people always pick number 1 when they have to choose. You would have layer 3 start to die off fast, followed by layer 2. While layer 1 would have full population.
---
Didn’t exclude myself from this but I don’t find myself to be as annoying as loud dumb arrogant and stupid germans on teamspeak. It’s entirely objective tough
---
How do you duel if there are no players?
---
Have to put this antsy energy somewhere
---
Only issue is, football actually takes skill. Classic WoW takes time. 
---
You’re equating physical activity to (literally, in many cases) one button rotations. It’s just not the same.
---
How do you feel about movies?
---
🙄🙄🙄 why do you guys act like you stop and have a life story conversation with every random you walk past?
---
Depends on the healer really. Most of them are actually retardedly hard to kill because they just heal up and slip away. You probably won't kill them but you won't be killed by competing farmers. 
---
Like if I as a warlock bump into a priest while farming herbs I'll leave him alone. If I bump into a mage or rogue I'll just kill them and herb the lotus. I probably could kill the priest but it would take forever and another player might show up at any time and then I'm pretty much screwed. This is also my experience from playing a priest. Generally people will leave you alone unless you're going for a lotus or something really expensive.
---
200IQ Ad hominem attempt
---
Of course we think Blizzard has considers the numbers. But considering they didn’t even accept that we wanted Classic WoW until fairly recently, we are rightfully concerned they are underestimating demand severely.
---
I kind of hope streamers rise to this bait and roll Herod, that way we’ll have the streamer spergs and anti-streamer spergs quarantined in one hellscape of a server.
---
Most streamers are going PvP servers and in the US it’s pretty agreed they will not be on Thalnos for East Coast and one of the west coast ones. (This was stated by Esfand and he said there was a collective of streamers who said they would avoid those two servers)
---
I mean sure, it can be very effective and I don’t disagree with you there... but do we need so many new threads talking about the same issues every day? I’d rather have hundreds or thousands of people report bugs properly instead of coming to reddit and going “yeah happened to me once lol” but hey gotta farm that sweet karma I guess.
---
It's a bug. This isn't how it's supposed to work, and I'm sure they'll fix it. I'd rather have a playable game with layering than server crashes and multi-hour queues.
---
That's not even the point of this post. Why isn't a region known for being hardcore gamers not getting a pvp realm just boggles my mind.
---
and what will you say when they go back on their word as they always do? Oh yeah wait, you will be still in your office astroturfing for some other company that hired you paid shills.
---
As in the one with 50 members compared to the one with 3,000?
---
Dude. That’s not even the point of this post lol.
---
As an example, The final boss in Blackwing Lair fears the tank so having a dwarf priest is almost mandatory

I've never played an RPPVP server, what is it like? I'm considering it for the community aspect even tho I don't really RP. Do you have to RP? Are there any weird rules?
---
Yeah, wanding is free damage that costs you nothing, and it's FAST damage. If you do a lot of wanding you don't have to drink, and not drinking saves you some sweet money. If you have a mage friend who can pile you high with waters, you might wand less (because you can just drink), but you will undoubtedly be wanding your way to 60 because it saves you a lot of money and frustration.
---
Me personally I'm paying for classic with my retail Wow gold. Retail will be mainly the thing to screw around with whenever classic burns me out. It's so easy for them to coexist. They both support WoW in the end and both of their popularity and state of players is important. I'd be lying if I didn't want a successful classic to influence changes in retail though.
---
I'm not super familiar with everything here but AFAIK the guy just listed reasons why he shouldn't 10-man a dungeon... which is not entirely helpful? It's weird that we're pro-classic WoW, but against people doing whatever fun (and possibly meaningless) shit they want.
---
It seems like a bug and I don't see the harm in fixing it... but I could be mistaken.
---
Man, so many many problems, and the release is in less than 20 days....

Lol no I can honestly say I'd rather lag than be layered.
---
And I'd rather you go back to watching asmongold instead of shitpost on reddit
---
Holy shit you're daft.
---
Go priest if you want to be able to play casually, much easier to find a group as a healer than a dps
---
you get to select a sub server essentially.
---
You can talk to a GM for any reason, you just have to wait
---
They're nice to have but I wouldn't sweat it. Some of the best times you'll have in the game are those long road trips.
---
I'd like to see them do something like having Herod-1, Herod-2, Herod-3 etc for the first week or two and then combine them into just Herod.
---
....clearly that’s just layering and not people losing interest in a temporary stress test...
---
I mean. I played nonstop until 15. Spent all of yesterday and Friday sorting out a leveling path.
---
Logged in this morning. Explored a bit. Now I’m out of stuff to do.
---
I’d imagine the less dedicated ran out of things to do and or lost interest earlier.
---
Uhh ok haha. Good talk. 
---
There’s literally video proof in this clip showing people outside the gates. But hey. Phasing bad. Right?
---
Do you have a source on that?
---
That's because they speak Portuguese
---
I know Classic might fuck up my relationship, possibly my workcareer, it's scary but also the true nostalgia!
---
&gt; It’s not hard, just takes time.
---
Oh, you've seen the code? Nice, that's pretty cool.
---
100% a thing I remember too, why there’s a path from that gy almost directly to the dungeon
---
I'm planning on making a snack/food post (with some recipes!) this week, so keep an eye out if you're interested! I love all the items I'm seeing people reply with, though. :')
---
Not if you cap how many people can be on 1 layer
---
Unholy mother of Satan.
---
It seems broken to me? - It just says #REF. Would love to see this work.
---
It's a bunch of fear-mongering.  People trying to latch on to anything they can to scare folks into believing the same things they do.
---
For the 50th time, they're removing layering permanently after first phase. If that stretch of time is enough of a deterrent for you then good luck elsewhere.
---
I can't believe that video is actually real.
---
Yes complaining about a major feature is tantamount to treason!
---
The main problem with that is there ends up being a ton of people like you. What OP is saying is true for RP PvP but even on retail most normal RP realms have died and become normal PvE realms because a ton of people migrated without contributing to the community. You’re welcome to roll where you want to but when there’s 10000 people on the same boat as you, it’s easy to sink it.
---
Most private servers don't even bother with the one faction per pvp server rule.  It's pointless to have that rule in place, because, like you said, it's free to make an account.  So they just let you have horde and alliance on a single account.
---
No, he's making fun of an anti-steamer post on forums. It's almost direct copy pasta
---
Now you're changing your story. Because I'm pretty sure Heroes of the Storm does not have a trade chat.
---
&gt; And no i didnt tell someone to go get fucked in his ass. I just engaged in something that was going on in trade what where people wrote anal and then posted a spell or item that had a name that sounded funy after anal. Stuff like anal [corruption] and stuff like that
---
Try now - the original source table was edited to add a new column and broke my sheet!
---
U dont know shit
---
just use macros and you will always use the highest rank automaticly.
---
Better to just finalize your character before reserving the name on the 12th. If you create it really fast and reserve the name, only to delete it on launch day to take 3 minutes to decide on looks, someone might snipe your name during those 3 minutes all the same :/
---
Not 1.0.9, but 1.9. The auction houses in darnassus and stormwind came with the AQ patch.
---
You're assuming the layer capacity doesn't change throughout. As the population  concentrations dip because players disperse and the number present in starting area choke points is lower, they can adjust the layer capacity, raising the relative density in higher level zones. If you're ahead of the pack you'll likely always have a somewhat empty world, but still be able to reach out to other layers for group or social content. 
---
Remember, the layers can expand because the number of players in the starting zone will be a diminished fraction with time. While a layer cap of 200 might make sense on Day 1, most of those players will have moved on to another zone by Day 2 and even if you have an equivalent influx of new players (unlikely) you can easily raise the cap to 300-400 without anyone noticing a significant difference in density at the lower levels while increasing density in the higher. Then on Day 3 you expand again, and so on. People ahead of the curve *will* become increasingly isolated, but no differently than if there were an equivalent number of servers once the Layer cap catches up to Blizzlike, which shouldn't take very long. 
---
Also, keep in mind this is coming from someone who found the Barrens to be too barren during the stress test. I'm *hoping* numbers get tweaked more than anything, but want to express a potential moderating effect to your misery.
---
I looooove tailoring but even I'd say 'no.' I mean, BiS is BiS but the % difference isn't THAT bad. Go with what you want to actually do. If you go herb/alch you'll be fine (and have to spend less money on consumes). If you're really concerned you could level with herb/tailoring and save your herbs in the bank. At cap, get and make robe, then dump tailoring for alchemy.
---
The problem is that the bloodvine set becomes BiS later and then you'd have to pick tailoring back up, but by then most people would be ditching herbalism for it. I'd only do this if you're a really serious/dedicated raider, though.
---
Except it isn't. It's a bug. [Source.](https://www.wowhead.com/news=291722/layering-in-classic-wow)
---
&gt; Sharding is just objectively worse. Its layering but with people from other realms.
---
Since when? Sharding is usually small per-zone instances, the term never had anything to do with other realms.
---
Upboars*
---
FTFY
---
When did they announce that layering would be permanent on Classic? I constantly see these posts about how layering is screwing things up but it’s only supposed to be utilized for a couple weeks post-launch.
---
I actually used to be someone who wanted Classic to fail. I saw it as a niche product and I saw it as competition to current WoW. Mostly in the aspect that it splits the player base, and splitting the player base tends to end badly for games. It also takes resources away from the current version of the game via existing. It wasn't my cup of tea, and since I saw it as a threat to what I liked I was hoping it would die down. Honestly, I thought it was a product that would be popular for a small amount of time and then pretty much die, forcing the the game to drag it's dedicated corpse.
---
I shifted my mindset for a few reasons. One, yeah, it's kinda dickish to hope other people's chance at fun gets ruined because it's not mine. Like, if Classic competed with Retail, it's because people wanted Classic. It's not fair to make sure other people don't get catered to because it might hurt my experience. Blizzard did a pretty good job at making sure classic is a closed ecosystem, and I enjoy that - people won't be playing for Transmog, so it's not really pulling anyone other than people who WANT to be there. 
---
The second reason is that I gave it a chance and found that I enjoyed Classic. I had a bad experience initially but ended up really having a good time when I gave it a chance. It also shocked me to see just how vibrant the community was, despite the hassles of installation.
---
And obviously, reason three, I was just kinda being immature for something that doesn't matter. Like it or hate it, success or failure, it doesn't matter at the end of the day.
---
There are almost certainly others out there that haven't come to the same realization or who just rabidly don't want it to succeed, for whatever reason. Some folks will do this kind of stuff for attention too.
---
It’s more than speaking Portuguese, it’s mostly that they are cancer.

I am all for keeping it vanilla, but man, Prot Paladins do need a taunt :(

I actually really like Asmon. Never watched twitch but the YT vids of him are pretty hilarious.
---
Can we start a stream sniping guild on that server just to fuck with all these douchebag streamers like this dork?
---
   
---
To go offroad, I take a dirt bike. To do the circuit, I take a supersport motorcycle. That my supersportive does not perform well in the forest does not make it suboptimal. I just did not understand the interest of one over the other. In the future, if I want to go off-road, I will use a proper bike.
---
&gt;Even if the infrastructure is similar or shared, the parameters matter greatly.

Bla bla bla..You run around, and the people you are interact with disappear in front of you.

Theres no general realm population. Looking for a home not a shitty button sim
---
Yeah that would be a false dichotomy.
---
The best solution has always been many more servers, with dying servers being merged when needed
---
How do you know that? AFAIK some eastern time zone servers on retail are actually served from LA, and vice versa. Which makes absolutely no sense but it's true nonetheless.
---
Well it wasn't, he literally talked about gameplay mechanics, implying they are worse than in retail WoW (LMAO).
---
Is there any difference for EU servers?
---
I'm generally fairly pro layering for the launch window, but this is one concern I have with the system. Blizzards tech for phasing has just kinda sucked, and I was worried bugs like these would creep in. I hope they do get it up properly before launch.
---
Shazzrah seems the most popular for English but to me it seems pretty much a tie.
---
OP is lying, and I am not sure why
---
This shit doesn't even happen on retail that doesn't even have these restrictions. Yeah people rage message occasionally but not nearly to the point it is a problem, report them and move on. What kind of thin skin have you guys gotten lately jesus. Yeah I want it disabled but like the other guy said, mountain out of a mole hill, there is no practical use or point in abusing it.
---
Sweet, I really enjoy your art.
---
there's zero evidence of their evidence to be disruptive
---
Seriously, this kinda shit needed to be fixed in an alpha not a beta. Beta releases these days are barely different from their live releases. Companies basically use betas now for small bug fixes and as a demo to hype a release.
---
INV ASMON LAIR
---
In retail when he needs gold he says to his chat where's he's gonna go sit and just waits for people to give him gold
---
Level whatever you want, my cousin was enh in raids. Our guild was op though. He was decent DPS and would normally only take lesser wanted items.  If it was me, I'd swap resto at Cap because it's more helpful... But you can probably find some groups that dont mind you throwing down some deeps.
---
Hopefully some decent private servers pop up
---
Too easy dude.
---
15.) We can literally breath underwater making us masters of multiple domains.
---
16.) Ever want to be a melee caster? Look no further. Once we get our glowy red hands of love and equip a firestone, we can play a roll that no one else dares to. 
---
17.) We are so loved by our free girlfriend and all our pets that they actually do more damage for us!
---
18.) As Orcs we haven't been dead and decaying for who knows how long. Thats because no one has tried to kill us. Why? Because we're Orc Warlocks.
---
That's by brazil
---
All that needs to happen for someone to be accused of being a stream sniper is for them to gank a salty streamer. Let's not pretend that these people are going to use some sort of peer review to decide if someone was actually sniping or not. They're going to get salty, call people stream snipers, and impact innocent players ability to play the game.
---
Behold, I shall taunt thou unholy monstrosity.
---
The meta is to stay enh and just use int/sp gear while healing in dungeons (until 50-ish, then do a full or partial respec).
---
Well, you can only play until tomorrow since the last stress test ends then. AFAIK there will be no other opportunities to play until it kicks off on the 27th.
---
Same with spending 2 hours per mob on the first quest for many others. Not everyone will be happy
---
Because that's what blizzard says on their support page.
---
Working perfectly now.
---
Since its inception. It puts you into a layer with other players without regard for realm. Go into retail right now and run around and you'll see plenty of people from other realms. To combat this in classic they created layering, which is exactly the same but only people from your realm.
---
Holy shit. Wtf.
---
Holding right click makes the camera locked, kinda behaving like a shooter I giess.
---
They don't need to have an intention of allowing it up to Phase 2 to say it will be gone by Phase 2. Phase 2 includes elements which are seen as more incompatible with layering than other elements of the game and thus define a hard limit for the inclusion of the feature. Their intention can always have been to remove layering before then while making the statement it will be gone by Phase 2.
---
Yeah a reportable offence that wouldn't even be used. I sure hope there isn't out-of-game communication programs that people are going to utilize like crazy to do the same thing. I agree it should be disabled but this is a completely minor situation.
---
Except many, many people would disagree with the idea that merging servers is better. The entire server community, something this subreddit claims is one of the best parts of classic, would be completely disrupted.
---
This is all the real deal from back in 2005, although I reworked all tekst and layout (and added a lot of new story to the images). As hosting goes offline, and circumstances happen, it had been gathering dust for quite some time, and needed a lot of time to bring it up to 2019 standards.
---
That's how it is supposed to be. Normally shouldn't the whole continent be one layer?
---
If rather a breathable world where no one but me is in the shimmering flats, rather than 100 nameless faces ill never interact with again just taking space.
---
Casuals tend to go alliance.... lmfao. Not even sure if I should argue with you because I feel like I'm talking to a mule. However, based on accurate statistical analysis, 42.7% of horde are below average intelligence and therefore it would require more than 1 horde to kill an Alliance.
---
So it varies by the people I'll play with. Alrighty, thankyu.
---
Ya, i've gotten tons of BS aswell for pointing out how damaging this is gonna be to the game and the community. People love to have on their blinders until shit actually hits the fan, at which point, first impressions are already fucked and trust is gonna be really low for Blizzard as they havent even advertised layering anywhere in official blue posts to make sure people at least know what shenanigans will await them in Classic. 
---
But no... it's "just like back then" and an "authentic experience, from the beginnings"... good one Blizz.
---
That's the upside.
---
what jank you speak of? ...Im not so sure of that. It never feels normal to do something for the action to execute later. Specially not at this time, with the age of league, fortnite and basically action based games. The laggy, glitchy game experience belongs to history. Im sincerely surprised blizzard doesnt realize that
---
Kumquat.
---
But why?
---
Sharding is per zone. Cross realm is what allows people of different servers to be seen together or play together.
---
Layering is per continent. Layering and sharding are similar techs with the difference being effective size.
---
Kinda sad but very wholesome! Glad classic is helping bring joy to your family life :)
---
M'World M'of M'Waifucraft
---
Wrong. It won't be going away unless Blizz feels the pressure from us
---
I couldnt decide either between mage and priest. Im going with mage first for faster leveling, easy farming gold, teleports and free food/water. Then i make a priest as alt character because i want hin to be a healer and it takes a bit longer to level
---
Dumb af tbh, as if a forum post would stop them.
---
Why would it be hard? I’m pretty sure Blizzard hires good server developers.
---
Affli demo, either 31/20/0 or 30/21/0 does the job depending on if you want more mana or a pet oriented spell like fel domination
---
Layering stole my wife and murderer my first born child.
---
curious about this as well, I havent been able to find anything on Asian servers at all? Source?
---
Can confirm, the munching/lip smacking is fucking disgusting with an open mic and I turn off streams too once the streamer starts eating like the other guy said.
---
Yea I was worried about needing to draw attention to something urgent, thankyu for answering. 
---
Also, you made me laugh with your example, so thankyu for that one as well.
---
You'd definitely be gimping yourself in a raid without 5% spell crit, Kings, and even Sanc.
---
That and Wanker for us Brits. Let's go Blizzard.
---
Heh, i had a sensible chuckle from that.
---
Yeah, who wants to be on an icky server that inherently feels more alive and encourages social interaction in an *MMO***RP**G? Gross!
---
Unless they intended the Barrens to be as barren as they were, then I think it's actually more likely they're using actual layering instead of sharding.
---
funny how people downvote you out of jealousy
---
Yeah I mean, no matter how good, or bad the guy is ... it's just the one guy. Who gives a shit he records his gameplay and streams it ?   
---
But like Asmongold I mean ... I don't even know the guy, but the army of "inv to asmon layer" ... no. Just no.
---
How can you check FPS in classic?
---
Where did you get the idea it was different from Sharding? They've described and shown its literally the same thing expect everyone is from one realm.
---
Many of us leveled to 60 and raided on private servers with 130 ping constantly, you'll be fine
---
youre implying its mutually exclusive to bug report it and loudly complain on the community sites.
---
Exactly. Who cares if it was 5 armour or 20? That’s not the point. It’s so pathetic that some individuals get so hung up on shit like this. Take a deep breath and let it go, not everything has to be a battle!
---
What classes/specs will you be going?
---
I'd also suggest skinning, but sell some skins on AH and vendor others (heavy hide is a big one that sells well on AH, if not immediately then down the road). Someone could take enchanting specifically do DE unwanted quest items/greens/etc. Put greens on the AH that will sell well and DE the rest to sell the essences.
---
It's hard to know what will do well and what won't until we see populations. If everyone's putting enchanting mats on the AH, they will be going cheap. If everyone avoids enchanting they'll be sought after.
---
I probably wouldn't take skinning/mining/herb between you because you'll be going way out of your way to level them all, but skinning for one person and herbalism for the other could be good. You could pair it with alchemy to sell things at max level, or just opt to not take another profession to save time/money.
---
In every MMO I've played that's seen server merges (and WoW isn't one of them; I don't think Blizzard has ever merged servers at least in EU and NA) people have hated the merges when they happen.
---
Blizzard is going for the strategy they've already tried and found true, which is launching new servers if their existing servers prove insufficient. You know, exactly like they did back in the actual vanilla launch.
---
Server merges or shutdowns are one of the most detrimental things that can happen to an mmo. The news of such occurrences is basically the death knell of a game; none have yet recovered after taking such a step. Blizzard wants to avoid accidentally condemning classic by opening too many servers for launch only to see population drop off later turn them into dead/ghost realms.
---
I think there should be a unified blacklist tool, kind of like that gear check iso tool? I can't remember the name. But I always wanted one for bad healers, tanks, and toxic players. No rating system, just comments. People would just abuse ratings if they "didn't like" someone.
---
We'll never know for sure but I think they put every report into a long-ass queue that they get through *eventually* but bump people who are getting reported a lot up to the top of the list
---
It feels horrible when I play warlock and some guy buff me and I'm unable to buff them back. I could offer a healthstone but usually they're already far
---
Nice strawman
---
Glad you're enjoying it OP :) the game is very rewarding, and challenging, and beautiful. BFA is Nepotism - you are handed your fortune for doing nothing
---
Classic is more like living in a cabin in the woods with a hunting rifle and 6 bullets
---

How?

You can't invite them, you can whisper them.
---
Hopefully they'll all be gone within a year.
---
Hyperbole

the first month is going to be the biggest impression on audiences. if cities look dead in the first month, it's going to start a landslide of opinion Blizzard and fans will have to combat.

Shit all over my cake day why don’t you
---
Can I get a link?
---
Inb4Deleted
---
Possible pre 1.10
---
Unlikely.
---
But even if they do remove it, most people are going to quit directly because of layering. Why not just scrap it entirely?
---
Use the fucking searchbar. This question is asked multiple times a day.
---
fuck spammers
---
What are you even talking about dude? I literally just said I will be playing classic and some how your head is exploding because that is too much for you to handle?
---
This is sad stuff. My enthusiasm just went through the floor.
---
It's only for a month until it isn't.
---
Looks like we're all going to be playing on the Thanos server whether we like it or not.
---
Minimap tracking button was NOT IN VANILLA.
---
Im not changing my story, im saying that i got a 24h silence in heroes too, not instead.
---
What? People made characters on th3 other faction to trash talk all the time?
---
Mike Hunt
---
I would unironically have preferred that over layering, yes.
---
1 Phase  - or so they say
---
&gt; Roll on Waifumane.
---
Or Memekrik
---
that's not true. we were simply lied to. last blizzcon ion hazzicostas said they are thinking about using sharding in a VERY LIMITED WAY for the first FEW weeks... now its planned for the entirety of phase 1 and from what we were able to see in the beta and the stress tests, calling layering a "very limited way" of sharding is just not true, it is nearly the same. so who knows what will happen after phase 1.
---
Or maybe this is a bug that'll be fixed before launch and you don't have to be so dramatic about it?
---
Why add more expansions to a fucking legacy service you mongoloided retard
---
Hope that teaches gets to you
---
Rose colored glasses of vanilla. Anyone saying they want calinna launch all over again is a moron. I dont want laying, but I accept it to avoid that bullshit again
---
It's the placeholder icon
---
I don't like this but I can understand why he wants it. I feel sorry for him and others that get truly negative experience just because they are streamers.
---
Is there a way to auto-attack automatically when the enemy target enters melee range?  Like I'll open with a ranged attack, the boar will run up to me, but then my character does nothing unless I hit the auto-attack key or right-click on it.
---
A streamer with 20k+ viewers will out-weigh a guild of mad redditors lul
---
Are you stupid?  You were not in my raid group which is what the story is about. So you telling me you were is hilarious. Maybe learn to read English before you respond.
---
Poor Little Luckystrike? 🙂
---
It works the same way as in retail. Are you saying it's not intended to work that way and it's been a bug since they've implemented it?
---
No arena. It would be fun but I can live without it
---
By that same logic, they didn't have to take shortcuts either and deliver a sub par product.
---
Is there an option to change the language of the game from English to Spanish? Where all text and dialogue is translated?
---
My experience is that Horde is more focused on pvp than the Alliance.
---
Poor little fanboy got offended that someone disagrees? Go play pserver. No layering there. Problem solved
---
As a Druid just be sure to always have water pre-10. Also, when the mob has 25% HP left drop a Moonfire and staff-whack the rest of the mobs HP. That will help with downtime by a decent margin.
---
 RemindMe! September 3rd, 2019
---
Horde tends to have better racials for pvp, and paladins don't really shine until endgame in pvp
---
That and half of them just say the same stupid stuff other people say. It's like a meme at some point.
---
thats the point, its not in australia lol
---
Bro Durotar is just nostalgia. That place is super ugly and boring. Mulgore all damn day.
---
Ill take a hard time over a shitty time any day
---
Yep, I was skeptical when they first said it would be gone by phase 2. After they released the realm list, I feel like it's here to stay. It's also why I did a 3-month subscription instead of 6.
---
No way man. Blizzard is gonna make layering permanent because blizzard bad. 
---
Atleast that’s what reddit thinks.

---
[[Not exactly sure how I feel about some Swedish neets being able to provide me a more realistic classic wow experience than Blizzard](https://i.imgur.com/SxxkVwk.png)
---
Yeah, that would make sense. Deal with everyone but people who are reported more have priority.
---
ClassicAuraDurations is what you're looking for
---
And that will continue to bite us all in the ass for the entire duration of classic. While I understand that this is far cheaper than taking 1.12 and modernizing it, classic will probably have "minor" differences compared to 1.12 for a very long time.
---
They are probably doing some testing behing the scenes? Is the stress test still going on?
---
Lol wow. I highly doubt they will fix this before release
---
Dude has some positive attitude and he had some good points of state of the game. But, begging for rl money and ingame gold, hanging out with whore scammer which was banned from twitch and getting her back again - fuck this shit. Worst idiots are Towellie and Sodaguy, and I wonder how the fuck I even heard about these scumbags. As guy said, I'm happy to play on EU servers.
---
Just make a new account under the same email.
---
Of course. Most people who quit will do so because of layering. But they'll just conclude "I guess the nostalgia wore off"
---
Yeah I agree it is unlikely.  Maybe just small additions like one new raid or something every once in a while though would be nice.
---
Imagine the competition of traders... This 2 servers per region bs is unrevealing more and more issues than I thought...
---
You forget about the Gurubashi?  It's the only arena Azeroth ever needed.
---
I dont really care about the proper terminology when what I said is still what happens in the game. Call it whatever you'd like in practice theres no discernable difference when playing wow if your sharded or layered except for the fact that shards have other players from different realms.
---
That part where you’re at level 60 for a few months, Naxx has been defeated, and suddenly everybody goes to Blasted Lands and can go through to Outland and continue the TBC adventure.
---
Some people will defend absolutely anything Blizzard does.
---
LOL.. strawman. An exaggeration for sure but not a strawman. You must not have played classic launch where it was simply a laggy tagging simulator in early zones
---
They are planning to table over 1 server like zul'jin on retail
---
Wonder if the invite had something to do with it ...
---
Why can't they just set up multiple servers and the delete then or merge them?
---
&gt; Layering seriously needs to get [removed] before release...
---
There. I fixed it.
---
On the one hand, it's encouraging to see the anti-layering argument finally getting the popular support it always should have around here.
---
On the other hand, with barely two weeks to go until Classic launches it feels entirely "too little, too late."
---
I was already on board with it but, with Blizzard once again sacrificing authenticity on the altar of expediency like this, I'm looking forward to the eventual launch of Pantheon even more these days.
---
Shamans have a totem that does the same thing as fear ward
---
I get the hyperbolic “Vanilla is literally heaven, Retail is literally hell” silliness that gets pushed here. But this is a little bit absurd even by our standards.
---
Only min max groups will prefer dwarves. Race doesn’t determine group acceptance almost all the time. Play the race you like.
---
Blizzard shills do it for free. They're that pathetic.
---
In theory? Not sure - both specs cannot pull their own weight.
---
In practise, I imagine I’d rather bring an Ench Shaman over a Ret Paladin because the optimal # of Shamans is eight and eight Resto Shamans might prove difficult to find.
---
When you go to add a new subscription, you can click on your account name below where it says "YOU ARE SUBSCRIBING TO World of Warcraft® Subscription" and there is an option to create a new account.
---
They don't have to pay people, shills volunteer themselves and there's a lot of them in this sub.
---
And as has already been said, that's not sharding, that's Cross-realm Zones.
---
~~Herod~~ Harold is the only good one imo
---
Yea I'm not surprised at all. I think that streamers are in for a rude awakening in Classic especially after being sheltered in beta for so long. As far as I've seen, the streamers really didn't get much grief in beta. Even the ooga gang were polite for a group of dedicated gankers. Just wait until the streamers get a taste of what real toxic griefing looks like.
---
Yeah but their fanbase will not be the elite raiders, but mostly mediocre to bad casual raiders.  Because the good raiders are in the good guilds, playing the game.  Personally I think most of their fan base are non raiders...
---
I'm surprised to see asmon being such a baby about ganking on a pvp server.
---
What’s the difference? You do know that everyone will be spamming their location, in game, EVERYWHERE. You think people won’t know what zone Soda is in, whether you’re watching him or not?
---
I never said those were the only options, can you read?
---
yeah and isnt horde/alliance colluding bannable as stated in TOS
---
LOL caught like the dumbass you are. Go suck some more blizz cock you loser.
---
He says provocative stuff and somehow people are incapable of not being triggered by it.
---
Just look at some of the replies to your post... He is also right in saying that people don't get to dictate where anyone else plays.
---
I don't really see the appeal of watching steamers full stop if it makes any difference.
---
Horde guilds have tremor totem... which is an AOE cure fear, but it pulses so its not immediate or make you immune to fear.
---
This has been answered numerous times, it's not an issue anymore.
---
I would avoid using Trade for early professions advertising. Too much spam, competition, and people will be out questing anyways. 
---
Instead just advertise in general as you pass through zones during leveling. Like if you’re heading back to Sentinel Hill, offer bags- and a few people will hustle back to hit you up. Repeat repeat.
---
Then fucking avoid them. This streamer hate has been done to death. Let it go.
---
So what you are proposing is to actually not let people play with their friends if they happened to start slightly later, and the layer is already full.
---
Like I said, it's a terrible idea.
---
ITS OVER BOYS.
---
Lmfao you people are pathetic.
---
LMAO
---
Yeah a huge amount of people are going to quit because of layering. It shouldn't be in the game at all.
---
They have every right to play on any server they want.
---
The issue is if they are streaming, they will bring an army of rabid fanboiz with them. These people are not there to play the game and be part of server community, they're there to worship their idol.
---
These hoards of fanboiz will ruin any server community, and that's what everyone is afraid of.
---
If these streamers want to play classic without any issues, they can just turn off the stream like the rest of us plebs.
---
But if they are going to bring their fanbases and ruin classic for us, it's only fair that we do everything we can to do the same to them.
---
Just the way he talks to people in general. 
---
It's clearly his persona. But he still talks down to people a lot.
---
Oh man, guess I'll be a good boy. Laggy tagging simulator where it takes longer to get 1 of 12 kills than it does the average crybaby to whine about a layering system that is going to be in launch regardless of the crying... look, I know the idea sucks, but it isnt going anywhere. These threads are getting old. I enjoyed when this sub was actually filled with classic content instead of pissing and moaning.
---
Classic launch was a god awful hot mess. I can suffer a while if it means it isnt taking me 20m to complete a simple kill quest. Everyone complaining so far thinks the sky is falling for just a bit of rain on their shoes
---
Not being able to create an ally and horde on the same PvP server.
---
Servers have a lot more capacity than they had back in the day.
---
I feel like this may be the single thing that has been posted to this sub more than any other thing, and by a long shot
---
Quite an assumption to make.
---
If there are so many of us, the server would then obviously be dead without us, right?
---
/rollseyes
---
jesus. streamers are a plague
---
Yeah same. I could care less if they get an early reservation.
---
You would think, but iirc they're doing cross realm battlegrounds, so I'm not sure if it'll matter that much...
---
Lag should be a non issue.
---
I think really your work schedule should decide.
---
I get up early for work so east coast should be good for me. Raid times should be earlier.
---
Expecting anyone to not be slightly annoyed at getting ganked is a bit ridiculous. Venruki is wholesome as fuck.
---
Rogue pickpocketing. Forget what level it is TBH but early on, that's good money
---
Meh I'll play wherever I play
---
How dare you bring facts into this discussion.
---
Why even play classic if you aren’t willing to work for anything? Also, buying gold should be a banable offense.
---
lol no. it’s like bluh and then meux is pronounced in a way i’m not sure there’s an equivalent of in english. think of how you correctly say hors d’oeuvres, that sounds. like the o sound when you say ‘gonna’.
---
Firstly,
---
Europe got way cooler server names than NA...
---
EU:
---
Purewood Village, Everlook, Zandalar Tribe, Hydraxion, Sulfuron...
---
NA: Mankirk, Herod, Pagle, Faerlina, Aetisha, only missing Elephantisha and Shanaynay now
---
And worst of all,
---
Bloodsail Buccaneers is an RP server. 🤦‍♂️
---
Herod it is I guess. 🤷‍♂️
---
I was going to say no, then checked ingame. Chat is just as delayed. So yes, this seems normal.
---
1st person to skin it gets XP then body dissapears
---
The first impression of the game will still be a layered world though. Games dont really bounce back from a terrible first month. If the pilot episode of a show sucks, how many people do you think are gonna watch episode 2, even if it's great?
---
It needs to be great from day 1 to get as many people playing as possible. Unless we can somehow personally /w all these people and ask them to stick around until phase 2.
---
Underwater breathing hahha
---
Wow. Have they not addressed these issues since their discovery?
---
yikes
---
Congratulations, you are part of the vocal minority. Would you like a cookie? Maybe a launch day themed pacifier?
---
Yeah this is actually a local custom, it really shouldn't be punishable.
---
:)
---
Don't you need like 5 or 10 signatures as well ? So if you have 10 people willing to cooperate you just have them all start in the same zone and pool their first silver each. Should have it in like 5 minutes.
---
make a list now of 30 or more names you would be ok using.  that way you can still chose a name on launch you are happy with and not be disappointed if the only 2 names you wanted are taken.
---
edited my post as I didnt read your original post completely. Silly me
---
Pretty much reflects general chat in game.
---
This is what I'm thinking as well.
---
Way back in classic one of my characters was on Pacific time, but I didn't really know what I was doing. I think East Coast is the way to go for the working man :).
---
It’s french you absolute chimp.
---
I'll love it when they close your server after you spend a few months of hard work
---
Should be able to
---
&gt; The entire population of a Kalimdor Layer could congregate at the Crossroads without being reassigned to another Layer
---
CITATION NEEDED
---
Release is in two weeks and a few days though.
---
But WoW Tokens won't be in Classic afaik.
---
Layering is such shit. I don't know how anyone can defend that. Its so immersion breaking when this happens.
---
Exactly, was brilliant! :D
---
You... Don't think he's prone to raging? Cause I think he's pretty prone to raging.
---
Well there's still some question, if say a hunter flared him successfully, or a mage managed to tag him with blizzard or CoC. It's not a clear cut thing, unless they literally walked up to him while he's in stealth and they aren't following him in any way beforehand.
---
Anyone who disagrees clearly haven't heard this masterpiece:
---
&gt;How do you tell, the one you love, that they are the ooone?
---
&gt; So many ways, to express love, it's hard to choose just oone (how you gonna do it?)
---
&gt; Some people like to kiss, some people like to hug, some lesbians like eatin' eachothers shit out of a cup.
---
&gt; Some people say I looove you, some even shout it out, some people puke semi digested shit into eachother's mouths.
---
Ya except I've went from excited about classic to unbelievably disappointed. Between the game breaking bugs that are still in the game, essentially all NA-PVP servers being ruined by streamers or non-english speaking people, the game is basically dead as far as I'm concerned.
---
Orc racial is best for PVP hands down. 
---
For pve go troll. 
---
Or which ever you like the looks of more.
---
And then while the house is burning they blame the company that built it
---
Mankrik for Horde
---
Pagle for Alliance
---
sure, anyone who doesn't want to participate in the globalization or use the internet can stick to their own language since they won't ever have to communicate with anyone beside their locals. problem only arises by the fact that germany is essentially leading europe forward and english is a necessity to operate within the union; sticking to a local language is a terrible practice for the economical growth considering the rest of the world have practically agreed that english is the global language for use in travel, trade, tourism, the internet, etc.
---
Wouldnt mind it removed at all, just people getting salty if I had written "Removed" instead of Fixed I feel like. However I rather have it removed and have laggy server / long queues than not be able to play with my friends / see people
---
no water is “eau” which is like “oh”. this is eux which is a different sound.
---
Fucking embarrassing
---
You prefer 2% dodge over instant ghost wolf in PvP?  
---
Yikes..
---
Awesome!  This is the perfect response I was looking for.  Appreciate it!
---
A new raid isn’t a small addition.
---
Yeh, I'm hoping this layering issue is enough to stop all the whiney people in this post from rolling on Classic (but they probably will anyway).
---
Geat analogy! You appreciate the little things way more when you're not a demigod.
---
Does anyone remember the comic wars? I think we'll see streamer wars....
---
Honestly I'm sort of excited to see how streamers impact the game.
---
No, we are all Thex.
---
Anytime, happy crafting !
---
And this ladies and gentlemen is why classic won't be that vanilla we once loved.
---
They weren't concerned about dead realms, they were concerned about Launch stability. No matter how many realms you create you can't stop a realm from.being high pop and having a shitty experience. 
---
Layers is cranked way up during stress, no one will really notice it on live.
---
Then why the fuck are you playing? Just give it up man, if Blizzard is just going to fuck the game up anyway, what's the point yeah? Gtfo
---
It's just hilarious that you'd rather have someone elses voice over an actor. What is it that makes it more enjoyable? It is completely fake.
---
&gt; they could have just offered free realm transfer when that happened
---
Come on, people would bitch more if this was the solution they used
---
dude, just get it out of the fucking game. i don't even understand the pro arguments. it makes server starts a little smoother at the risk of ruining the whole immersion and world feel. it wasn't in vanilla, it wasn't on private servers, fucking remove that shit.
---
That’s about what 1-2 sec delay, would macroing the fire-bolt to more of my spells be a semi work around?
---
Hope asmongold will roll on a PVP server so he gets ganked 24/7
---
&gt; Uhh don’t you mean open my mind?
---
Judging by your replies, you seem to lack the ability to think. So he went for the eyes instead.
---
Nope, Ion in a Q&amp;A said they were looking at solutions that may just impact the starting zones.  That is where it came from.  He never said it would definitively happened, but he put the idea out there as a possibility.
---
Hey! That isn't Thrall... What's going on here?
---
Nonlinkable achievements would work around that issue.
---
Fine, don your fur suit idc. I’m just saying go do something, rather than blatantly consume meaningless media. Watching Asmon gives you nothing
---
Oh, I thought they were going to be cross server... Could have sworn I read that somewhere. Maybe i'm just thinking of the beta.
---

---
At this point I really can't tell if some of you are just joking around (yes I see the Humor tag on this post) or too dense to understand that Layers are a positive change for us.
---
Without Layers we'd have insane Q-times. Not sure about you guys, but I'd feel really annoyed to take 2 days off and then due to DCs and Q-times not be able to play more than 2-3 hours.
---
No that defeats the purpose.
---
Perfect thank you! It’s exactly what I was looking for
---
Blizzard unfortunately have released far too few servers to now try and remove laying anywhere. There's two English EU servers for example, imagine Orgrimmar and Stormwind with literally thousands of people in them.
---
I thought layering was only supposed to be for newbie zones and probably only for like the first month, is that not the case?
---
Wouldn't need layering if we had more than 11 servers.
---
That's me vs asmon. You stay horde and steal asmons happiness, I'll stay alliance and swear on my very soul I will gank this guy on sight.
---
but staying alive and jumping away into the evening sun  is more stylish  (Richturpin, Hero of the People style)
---
Dude ive played this game since Vanilla, i know what im looking at lol, im not gonna wonder how a hunter saw him after flaring him :)
---
Just make it a Q time wait, fuck the people who don't like it. That's how it was. Layering breaks Classic wow.
---
I'm not claiming I'm "very smart", I'm just not delusional and gullible like you folks.
---
I'll be leaving on a trip right before launch and won't be back until 2 weeks after.
---
Will I be terribly far behind everyone or would it still be possible to catch up?
---
Where did such a demand come from? Please, send me the link to Swedes asking for a Swedish server.
---
RIP classic
---
Really, it's just a vocal minority. My theory, it's the same kinds of people screaming no changes that are likely to quit when they roll a meta hero and get killed by the enhancement shaman they tried to gank lol
---
I'm not even saying they are wrong to hate layering. But I guarantee the vast majority of players are more interested in being able to lvl without spending 20m on the into kill quests because they cant ranged tag everyone else's kills
---
Do you really think making another account and multiboxing is “work”?
---
But I like how you say working irl isn’t working. 
---
“Psh why arnt you willing work for anything?!”
---
After I literally suggest him to just go to work....
---
Why cant I backstab from in front of people? Worked on private servers
---
5 hahaha
---
I checked Tips twitter to try to find what he said about his guild leveling requirements and he said they were leaning towards Herod. Going to be a lot of crying in the near future.
---
I would like to set up a ui probably ElvUi. They say thats in alpha and has bugs but I cant even see it on my addon list. I also downloaded basic minimap and thats not showing either. 
---
Details posted an updated this morning saying he needs to update something in time for launch.
---
Onebag shows its loaded but its not changing the look of my bag ui. Its not on the minimap as an addon icon nor is it on the addon list in game under interface.
---
Wanna have dinner tmw? Around 4pm? Gotta be in bed by 6.
---
Dude you got one day of game time. That’s like, 40 cents worth of playing. Stop acting like you got a blowjob.
---
It's not random that they are in front of the bank or AH.  It's because they were either using the bank, using the ah, making sure they log out in rested area, LFG, or trading.
---
From that list, how many level 10 players on a stress test server do you expect to be sitting in org for no damn reason.
---
Do you have any evidence for that second claim? As far as I am aware, for the purpose of there being a balanced mob to player distribution, layering has worked quite effectively.
---
It still has other major problems (as shown by the videos of bugs popping up everywhere), but I don't think that is one of them.
---
Or grob.  No idea which is going to be more populated
---
Blizzard should just use Nost’s code. It’s better than this dumpster fire
---
I'm done with this discussion because you're clearly illiterate. Several of those questions were answered in the article. Learn to read and we can continue.
---
If I’m not mistaken sharding in BFA runs each zone as an individual instance. Since this is a downport, keeping that functionality of sharding should be trivial.
---
Dudes are fuckin savages up in here trying to pick up any scraps of an argument they can.
---
That‘s my fetish
---
Looks like you need a 2nd mouse!
---
1. Disagree. There are endless posts of new-to-vanilla players, and most layering complaints are the same people, and that is just limited to the reddit pool
---
2. Elaborate, because last I checked it was to avoid the launch issues from AND (what I assume you think is the only reason) handling casual player attrition
---
INV TO ESFAND LAYER!!
---
You sound like the sort of person who tucks in their polo shirts into their jeans.
---
Spriests are too tanky to get bursted and then they just oom the shaman to deaths.
---
Merging would need to happen multiple times per hour during the launch, so you'd just end up with sharding again. But, as Blizzard noticed from their Blizzcon 2018 talks, people (this sub specifically) don't like that so they made layering. 
---
Layering is just high speed merging (that also seamlessly handles forking), without splitting you and your friends up.
---
Hey there, 
---
it seems the discord link for Everlook - EU is not working. Maybe you can update it with this one instead? [https://discord.gg/C8DxGTy](https://discord.gg/C8DxGTy) Thank you!
---
Oldest trick in the book! Well played 😂
---
they come through both. if classic didn’t have bnet whispers appearing in it, then you’d just alt-tab to your bnet app anyway. it doesn’t really change functionality overall to not have it, so you might as well have it. people can turn them off in the wow client if they don’t want to see it there
---
Says literally nothing about anything. Ofcourse the difference wont be large when you include every company under the sun.
---
The sociopaths are likely to flock to the big and successful companies. Likewise the guy streaming Deadmines with 16 viewers is unlikely to be more than a just a regular dude.
---
LAYERING IS ONLY THERE FOR LAUNCH. IT IS NOT A PERMANENT PART OF THE GAME.
---
HOLY SHIT
---
you mean herod? Well it's a nice name that's about it.
---
Sucking them would be gay and I'm definitely not gay, I'm all about V-I-G-I-N-A!
---
I thought layering is only intended for continents
---
The game isn't out yet though, is that hard to understand? I agree that it'll be really shitty if they don't have everything worked out by then, but I still give them the benefit of the doubt here.
---
Bloom.jpg
---
I had it happen a lot during the first stress test months ago. Not once since.
---
When he posted 3 hours ago, he said +14 cloak.  Since then it's gotten even stronger.
---
It changes that you have 10x as many mobs and 10x as many players across 10x as many layers. That means 10x the overall progress of having only one fixed population server.
---
So Dank
---
you don't say? i had that happen on retail to me just now, and then when i was playing overwatch
---
I've only seen like an hour but esfand but he seems freaking adorable, lol.   
---
Love it.
---
why are you still giving blizzard the benefit of the doubt? they only gave us classic because they knew BFA was hot garbage and they dont want their cash cow to die and they have zero good ideas left. They can't even reboot classic correctly because they won't pony up the servers.
---
G E K O L O N I S E E R D
---
Shazzchads
---
they took bug reporting out already.
---
Holy fuck, this sub actually is all boomers.
---
How did they actually walk like that (boar insta 180) without the camera turning or model turn animation.
---
its positive for a inspect addict as myself. wasting to much time running around inspecting people in org :(
---
Or maybe they've been working on it this whole time, the fix just wasn't ready for the final stress test? It's very possible that they fix it in time. I agree that it'll suck if it goes live, but the way you're describing it just isn't how software development works.
---
All that and you didn't check your combat log?
---
Badboy, and Badboy_CCleaner
---
He's talking about mages, who have Blink, which makes escape artist completely redundant 99% of the time.
---
Yup, this whole "calling" servers thing is a riot.  Like, this guy called it for these people, it's over, nobody else can play on it!  lol
---
Did they confirm it won't happen once everything goes live, or did they confirm it wouldn't happen during the stress tests designed to test and break the system?
---
What a ridiculous expectation to have. Nothing will make you happy if that's the case.
---
„Faction of beasts and monsters“
---
Oh the irony. The alliance has been way more gruesome than the Horde. The horse is just a bunch of outcasts, because they look different
---
&gt;Who is really going to quit from extra stuff?
---
Broken game. That kind of shit turns me off, and I'm not alone.
---
" Unable to play or unreasonably slow questing? "   
---
Reverse psychology. Something you can't get is going to make you want it more. I've been partial to that philosophy in the past, as did all those old school Vanilla players. Maybe the reason they stayed wasn't in spite of the technical issues, but because of them? Just think about it. And obviously the game rocked.
---
" same way we have always dealt with irritating bugs for years "
---
Hopefully before the game drops.
---
I say keep it. Having someone cry to me for ganking them while they were questing is very satisfying
---
If a guy messes with me I shoot him with my load. All over his chest and face and down his throat
---
The game won't change, so once you set up addons, you won't have to fiddle with them for a long time, not having an auto updater is not such a big deal.
---
You can turn off smart auto cam in settings.
---
Hey man thanks for this.
---
Nah, I think you just don't fully grasp the implication of the issues that exist, or you never played vanilla.
---
The single defining feature that separates classic from retail is the isolated server communities. Without a doubt. Sharding removes that feature, therefore making classic essentially a reskinned retail.
---
I realize some people have deluded themselves into believing it's not a big deal, but it is fully game-breaking. Sorry to say, but classic will be trash because of this.
---
Have you ever watched any of his content? Guy comes across as a pretentious entitled arsehole. Don't understand how has garnered a fanbase
---
nope
---
when you get their attention post the reply. in before 'we're looking into it' with no mention of fix. we've been through this before
---
I don't know what just happened here but it's sweet and wholesome. You guys are awesome.
---
How do you see realm pop?
---
This is also a dumb argument to make as there have already BEEN changes. Layering, [Battle.net](https://Battle.net), Loot trading etc.
---
This is absolute trash. People need to be madder. It’s unacceptable.
---
Now THIS is content creation. I look forward to seeing Kor Kron on shazzrah
---
You can when its a big streamer with 100.000 viewers doing it on stream. Stop thinking the same rules should apply to everyone differently.
---
Streamers get a lot of advantages that anyone else doesnt get, and thus they should be held to a higher standard than regular people. Sitting in front of 100.000 people telling them to corpsecamp someone until that person quits the same should be grounds for suspension.
---
No it was just full of Swedes. Looking on the realm recruitment forums now and even looking at the first 3 threads listed, 2/3 are only accepting people from their country. I'm gonna be rolling on US and just dealing with the ping/time zones, can't put up with that shit again.
---
[deleted]
---
Anything and everything is fair game unless specifically agreed upon beforehand.  
---
    
---
There is only one rule; first to reach 1 hp loses.
---
"no its just beta, surely Blizzard wouldn't release azerite gear in this state.."
---
"no its just a beta, surely Blizzard wouldn't release legion legendaries in this state.."
---
"no its just a beta, surely Blizzard wouldn't have cut half of the expansion from WoD.."
---
"no its just a beta, surely Blizzard just has a bunch of placeholder daily quests!"
---
That is not how software works at all. If you want 100% working rate in your games you should find a new hobby. Bugs happen.
---
Thanks. Doesn't prevent the minmaxing hater-crew on this r/ from downvoting it, and you, for the sin of agreeing with me :D
---
i’d take that over this for months. This is what’s unplayable.
---
its a pserver bug
---
Damn Alexensual was right, wasn't he?
---
The other solution is to let you change your server on a whim instead of having layers.
---
We don't really know yet but assume that it will immediatley be up for grabs. So just take your name as fast as possible and then remake the character quickly later, almost everyone will make their character the first 6 hours of it being up, after that there's no way in hell your name gets picked up in the 1 min it takes to set up your char looks.
---
A real spanish would say "no hablo balconing"
---
If mods delete this they are the problem with classic.
---
**What is layering?**
---
Layers are virtual servers **the same size** as what a server limit would have been.
---
This makes the "I would rather have layers than fight over quests with 500 people" crowd especially retarded, as laters do **nothing** to remedy this. With layers there will still be 500 people per popular race starting zone.
---
Layers are basically scalable extra servers, at a very slight convenience over more actual servers.
---
"What's the alternative?" "wAhT aBoUt mAi NaMeZ?" You might say if you managed to rub your glorious two brain cells together.
---
Well that would be resolved easily by having groups of servers per region and type that share naming limitations.
---
Example: East coast could have 20 PvP servers, with names limited by groups of 5, and within those groups of 5 whenever 2 dropped below thresholds they could be seemlessly and automatically merged.
---
"bUt WhAtS ThE dIfFeReNcE bEtWeEn ThIs aNd LaYeRs?" You may ask if you literally are incapable of critical thought.
---
Well to answer: with layers, the active players you interact with slip in and out of your game world and is extremely immersion and community breaking.
---
With this proposal, the active people you leveled with and play with **will never change**. From a players perspective you will never have friends in a different game world, just suddenly a large injection of new players will appear. That may be slightly disorienting, but no where close to what layers will do to the game.
---
The only discernable reason layers exist is the same reason people still don't know what layering is: people (including classic developers) can and will be stupid, and still make it into decision making positions through nepotism.
---
Layering is only downside vs intelligent forethought and more physical servers, as the alternative is just as automatic and hands off as layering is intended to be.
---
I genuinely dont care if the first week is unplayable. I want authentic classic. We didnt need layering on launch or any private servers.
---
Another reason not mentioned to run your Druid over to Durotar to level: the Tauren Herbalism bonus. There will be plenty of herbs lying around in Durotar that other races simply won’t be able to harvest yet, but Tauren with their +15 skill will enable picking up all that Eartgroot no one else has enough skill to grab yet. If you level your Tauren in Mulgore, you are competing with everyone for herbs, but in Durotar you are competing with yourself.
---
Awesome thank you. Will be on my own for a while then : )
---
When was the last time Blizzard had stability issues EXCLUDING an expansion launch? Rofl. They were getting DDoSed in Nighthold, like.. 2 years ago? Lol
---
Orc is considered better than UD for warlocks, but not by much so pick what you prefer tbh.
---
You know that instead of having 10 layer we could have 10 servers and not deal with any of this bullshit.
---
When we take off the profanity filter the server crashes
---
Thinking of going enchanting for my Druid. Do the weapon enchants work when I am in an animal form? Also I hear Druids are good in pvp. But besides a long grindy fight do they have any burst ?
---
People said there was zero chance of them ever releasing Classic. Enough people shit on Blizzard long enough things changed, so shit on them relentlessly until they remove this blight on the game.
---
Do you believe there aren't enough realms? I was thinking they had too many. Really 4, one of each type, for NA is probably enough after phase 1.
---
Old epic mounts not being available.
---
Only thing that's bis is Engi. Everything else is just prefference since you can always just get Someone else to craft things for you.
---
I Guess enchanting is good for disenchant BOP. But It's usually too much of a gold sink to bother leveling unless your guild helps you.
---
it's not a thing on live servers. it's only a thing during stress test events. it wasn't even like this on the closed beta.
---
The latest version (17.0.5) works for me in classic - https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/move-anything/files
---
Yes. Realmpop.com.
---
Go to EU servers, constrain to level 120. That gives you roughly the population of active characters in BfA retail. I see no reason to assume that the classic population will have a radically different distribution. Another indication is also the number of German servers compared French and English. 
---
Honestly, it's not surprising. German speakers are the biggest native speaker language group in Europe (about 95 million) and all of them live in comparably wealthy countries (Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Northern Italy). It's also traditionally a very PC-centric games market, so Blizzard stuff has always been big.
---
So these videos are from the test? doesnt look awesome at all :D
---
lol what. If blizzard version is shit which it looks like it will be Ill go back to pservers which were at least fun approximations of Vanilla.
---
Maybe I don‘t need to play a different race because I want to „escape reality“
---
Maybe certain human class combinations simply look the best.
---
No this system that wasn't in vanilla won't make me happy.
---
Want to upvote but can’t support dirty alliance... FTH!!
---
I used to do the thing on my rogue where I'd pickpocket one of the Bristlebacks in the Tauren starting area, thus gaining their appearance.
---
Then I'd do the NPC walk and wait for a puny level 1 to attack me. Then... their death. :)
---
Never forgetti your spaghetti, friend
---
This is a Blizzard drone in it's natural habitat
---
Isn’t that just layering at its core? Rather than 1 server with 4layers you have 4 servers in a cluster that become 1 when they would have removed layering anyway
---
Hehe, no worries! We will meet in STV anyway :D
---
In my experience most whispers, raid chat, guild chat, and party chat is out of character (so you can talk about raid specs, talents, whatever). You can also plan events.
---
Basically you're only 'in character' when and if you want to be, and /say and /e are the only really 'for sure' in character aspects of the game.
---
So weapon enchants are useless on feral Feral druids? Or just on-hit enchants?
---
Why... Why do they all wanna be invited.... I Will never understa d this fanboy thing towards a soecific  streamer....
---
It's my job as well, and we can't really comment on their process since none of us have seen their code. Just have to wait to see if it's fixed in live or not.
---
So you are intentionally going to roll on a streamer server, and engage in wpvp scenarios only because of those streamers... and complain about the streamers?
---
If you *actually* didn't want to play with streamers, then you just wouldn't roll on their server. 
---
In reality, I bet you regularly watch the streams and just enjoy the drama.
---
It's gotten worse since beta though. So not only have they not fixed any of the bugs, they've actually *made it worse*. It was never an issue before where you would get put into another shard than people that are *in your group*. We're now seeing that happen.
---
So we went from bugged sharding on day 1 of beta, to a *more bugged version of sharding two weeks before release*.
---
I don't know what people aren't getting about this...
---
We already know layering is different than stated from stress test. Player numbers when I played were nothing like vanilla launch. Outside of the people logging on at server launch minute, it is going to be less severe than vanilla launch.
---
They did not make Classic because of the vocal minority. They made it to generate as much revenue as possible.
---
Try whispering please nicely asking for buffs, usually they'll toss one your way. I did that a few times to get an AI buff.
---
Fun fact: Shazzrah is also an unofficial polish server.
---
So have fun kurwa
---
orc pvp troll pve. it’s that simple. both do both fine.
---
Thanks, will use the second macro for class color. Regarding the first one though, what is it supposed to do? Tried using it but seems like nothing happened. Don't see any new text appearing. What am I looking for?
---
i love how everyone is showing server pride already but it feels a bit pointless cos of layering :(
---
Roguery can be a challenge in Classic and it can try your patience at times. Part of what you are experiencing is probably from a combination of things: low level, less than passable gear, low health etc. Things will change, especially when you get poisons, but you will always need to assess a group before attacking/pulling.
---
Forgive me if you already know the following, I am not making assumptions, nor do I consider myself an expert... Sap is your friend when attacking a pack, and taking down casters is both your easiest task and first priority. Vanish will be a staple “oh shit” button, or reset/reapply Sap button once you have it, and Kidney Shot can come in very handy in this regard as well. Find yourself up in points but low in health, Kidney Shot, Bandage and your back at it.
---
Groups of three are doable over time, but four is a challenge. With four, get one or two of the outliers first, Vanish and come back for the rest. Taking on groups is never optimal for Rogues, leather armor is not ideal for it, but what you lack in armor you more than make up for in burst DPS. Which brings me to Thistle Tea... don’t leave home without it.
---
Bye Felicia
---
Yes, but realm transfers take man power to do, which means money. Layering does not cost anything outside of the initial creation of the system. ActivisionBlizzard does not want to spend too much money on this project and have it be more of a money maker.
---
Blizzard modifies the API plenty often, not sure what you're talking about.
---
Layering is so similar to sharding that from these screenshots and videos it's hard to see the difference.
---
None of this nonsense should have ever been in the game.
---
You're also claiming you've been right "every damn time" without even saying what you've been right about. So again, /r/iamverysmart
---
The boys and *me* ;)
---
To the best of my memory the free blizzard transfers were only from high pop realms to low pop realms. Not from dead realms to high pop realms (which are equally as desirable imo).
---
As a hardcore min/max player, I can tell you that I envy what you have right now.  
---
A fresh and unexplored look at WoW as it was in 2006. I would kill to have that back again.
---
Same. Been playing every day and not once has this happened.
---
Then you should know that there's been additional bugs introduced to sharding since then, and 0 bugs fixed. That ain't good, not sure how else to explain this
---
So essentially, actively handicap yourself because the game is piss easy otherwise.
---
What fantastic encounter design.
---
&gt;banned for sweating too much
---
It's called Speed Stick. It's not expensive.
---
Pservers don't have phasing
---
Yeah cause the person would be slapped with stalking restraining orders eventually leading to societal backlash, something the anonymity the net provides people is the lack of that.
---
I was able to get Details, Onebag, and BasicMinimap set up with those links thank you. I was using the links from willitclassic and evidently some are incorrect or at the least out of date. 
---
Thank you again!
---
It’s 2019, grandpa, we got celebrities now
---
I want her to be my mom *and* my wife.
---
Why make gold when you can buy it?
---
Why raid when you can buy gear?
---
Why play this game at all just wait a year and buy someone’s account?
---
There's also this tool from Blizzard: https://us-looking-glass.battle.net/
---
It doesn't have Classic realms on it yet, but the data centers are the same.
---
Sorry I wasn’t very specific. They won’t merge servers they will connect them. Also, in vanilla they threatened to force server transfers when they opened new realms when people wouldn’t transfer on their own. After they threatened to move us with no guarantee you’d be on the same server as your friends people started xferring on their own.
---
I'd say the only meaningful world first in classic is going to be Ragnaros. Rest of the raids are going to be cleared in a few hours after they open up.
---
They are our No-Go zones. Filled with neo nazis.
---
That's a nice sales pitch but undead warlock is way better
---
I meant 1 PVE, 1 PVP, 1 RP, 1 RPPVP.
---
I love how already, while the game is still in beta, people just think the game is already going to be empty and blame it on layering.
---
RP servers in general are like any other server, except that you'll see people roleplaying all over the place. Just don't be a dick to them and you'll have no issues.
---
so what is this layer shit? people wanted classic and they did so much right but now right before launch they have added something nobody asked for that will make the game feel dead?
---
i know blizzard is struggeling but how hard is it to do nothing ?
---
Respect
---
Thank you for taking the time to write this.
---
I'm sure anything new you buy will be able to run classic, it's not very demanding at all.
---
You seriously think less than 100k players will stay post p1, when nostalrius managed to have more than that?
---
Whatever you're basing that on is anecdotal at best. 
---
There have a lot of people advocating for or defending layering on this sub. Nearly all of these are casual players who can't/won't spend more than a couple hours per week playing. (See, I can do it too)
---
Esfand confirmed in a Q&amp;A that Asmon was included in the decision to NOT roll Fairbanks. So we pretty much do know that Fairbanks is safe
---
In vanilla, the lengths that people go to be nice is countered only by the extreme lengths people will also go to be mean.  
---
It's a healthy balance.
---
Oh god now i cant wait to travel to New zones with my friends while talking about anything that comes to mind 😭
---
It blows me away people are like so what? What does it matter? Yet we were complaining cause the flight animation was the same as vanilla and this is def more impactful than that.
---
And it already looked unpopulated before you got phased...
---
Are you going to be playing a on a PvP server?
---
This
---
Private servers are better LMFAO....
---
How is this so bad? Game is literally sharded (sorry "layered") to shit.
---
Yes, Nostalrius was free, wasn't it?
---
It’s cause you’re on a different layer.
---
It’s for a couple months to manage the launch! It isn’t fucking permanent! I’m sick of hearing about these fucking reasons for no layering, we already know! So does blizzard! That is why it is FUCKING TEMPORARY.
---
Game is dead. Can we all just pick a private server and roll on there? Classic ain't happening
---
What's actually implemented and what Blizzard promised may be two different things. However, as stated, layering was never designed to have a smooth launch, and stating otherwise is incorrect.
---
I guess you could call it a...... GHOST TOWN!
---
hehehe... I'll see myself out...
---
No, I thought this too but was wrong. There are still PST realms hosted in Chicago and EST realms hosted on Los Angeles servers.
---
You can use this tool from Blizzard to determine the IP of each realm:  https://us-looking-glass.battle.net/
---
It doesn't have Classic realms yet, but is still very useful.
---
I played WoW back when it was released.  Played until BC was released.  I had a 60 hunter decked out it Dragonstalker, killed a boar in BC and a pair of green lvl 62 pants dropped that had better stats than the pants I raided for months to get.
---
I rejoined a week ago in anticipation of Classic.  I've logged into my old characters, I have no idead what is going on in live (retail?) and have no interest in trying.
---
I've spoke to a lot of people like me who are coming back after a 10 year hiatus.  Most have no interest in going to lvl 120 since none of their friends play anymore.
---
You’re going to love it
---
No, only for the dedicated fans. The tourists won't notice. Then the tourists will eventually leave and there will be almost no one left.
---
Activision Blizzard not giving Classic a great chance here. They just had to fuck it up somehow.
---
&gt; "but omfg if we dont do layering, the servers will lag!"
---
That is not even the reason for layering but stay in your bubble
---
Maybe they're taking all of their excited energy and pouring it into a doom and gloom scenario, all file subconsciously hoping that if they lower their expectations enough it might be pleasantly surprised when it isn't quite as bad as they thought it would be.
---
Palldin: *casts might on me*
---
Me: *spams swirly ball*  "you're welcome."
---
Lol ok. You just went from buying gold to buying fully decked out accounts. Yikes. 
---
Come back when youre ready for a real discussion.
---
interesting! thanks for sharing
---
You're not making a choice by following a blacklist. You let whoever writes the blacklist make the choice for you.
---
And again, this isn't about the consequences, this is about the reasons behind blacklisting someone. And that simply didn't happen 15 years ago.
---
Lots of words you’re putting in my mouth. You know what i mean. Work for what you have in game. Real world money should never be used for WoW outside of your subscription.
---
Great job testing bro, shit like this helps our community a ton
---
Well we can’t at that point
---
Love me some gnome nipps
---
That was my suggestion too.. its pretty much what layering was supposed to be, except you chose what layer to join when entering the world.
---
Yeah. He's pretty obnoxious. If you don't agree with him, you're wrong. If you don't like the things he likes, you're wrong. 
---
Also one thing that super bugs me about him: I have stumbled onto a few of his transmog competition videos, and he always gets like half of the transmogs wrong while acting like he knows everything. Small thing, but it bothers me more than it should lol
---
Holy shit you guys are all so cringe. REE STREAMERS RUINING MY GAME
---
I don't get why people get so fuckin' mad over this issue. It's a stress **TEST**. You shouldn't expect the game to be without bugs at this point, that's why you signed up for a **BETA**. It's obviously a bug and will obviously be fixed. Quit whining about it on reddit.
---
What i understood is that the spanish community  Goes to Golemagg, but not yet confirmed. 
---
My friends &amp; i will join Shazzrah Horde
---
Actually, it's 15 days until release so it's very much happening.
---
For me it's  “Hey guys, I don’t like any aspect of pvp whatsoever and don’t want or plan to participate in it at all, but my friends/guild are rolling on a PvP server because they're psycopaths like that. How do I not hate my life?”
---

I'm not at all a 'streamer person', but of the clips I've seen, you really are the least insufferable.
---
&gt; We just don't have to, nowhere. No incentive to learn it. 
---
Most people outside English-speaking countries don't have to. They know it because it's the international business language and frequently used on the internet.
---
Personally I believe the biggest reason countries like France and Germany don't know English as well as countries like, say, Norway is that they dub all their TV and movies.
---
Lmao this blows so much. A couple russian randos gavw us better servers than blizz. Smh i hope lights doesnt close now
---
People keep saying it's not supposed to be like this, however the game is already out of beta, release is in 2 weeks.  There's absolutely 100% the game doesn't launch like this.  It's really disappointing that people are defending this.
---
Idk if I saw a subreddit talk about how barren and empty a game is before it’s even launched I’d probably not want to play that game.
---
Suddenly? Reddit has almost never used logic
---
So the pet’s nameplate doesn’t say X’s Pet for the Horde player?
---
I love how you're the first person in every layering-related thread defending it or insulting people who are expressing concern.
---
Almost like you have a vested interest ($$).
---
Faerlina is the unofficial Spanish server
---
epic essay
---
Im with this 100%. Both versions have good things about them.
---
I love the adventure and the RPG aspects that Classic offers, i would love to see the return of more interesting stats and choices in retail WoW.
---
And in Retail i love the raiding and the way they tell the story while leveling through new Xpacs.   If i could just get a mesh of the two I would love WoW.
---
i wouldn't know, obviously not fixing layering. and tbh the only real fix would be removing it.
---
Yes one continent per layer
---
2004 beta, pre-release, we made a deadmines group. Zoned everyone in and dropped group, no one would get teleported. Group leader (empty group now) would invite 4 more and they could zone in. Rinse/repeat. Lots of people in there ungrouped, what a mess it was.

---
Why arent they just upping spawn rates or adding more spawns?
---
Do you think the streamers will fall off as well after the nostalgia wears off?  Might be worth weathering the storm so to speak.
---
Thank you but that time is not even going to be in the top 10000 I feel like. People should be able to get as low as 3days 10hrs or so
---
They're up until monday I believe, when the character creation goes live. Then that's it until launch.
---
What?
---
Thank you! I'll try it right away.
---
In game because you can create your toon.
---
There were fuckbois in 2004 too...

ilvl =/= BiS in classic
---
So what‘s the matter? A RL will invite the BiS people, not the highest iLVL chars
---
The link that you included in your comment above, when clicked, attempts to submit the video I posted as a new post, but in your comment you mentioned "the search results," so I figured you intended to post a link to the search results. I was just saying that your link doesn't lead to search results, it leads to a new post submission, which is ironic because your original complaint was that the video has been posted too much. lol
---
I'm going off of what osee115 suggested. And yes, from the player's perspective, each layer should act and feel as though it were its own independent server regardless of how Blizzard implements it.
---
Shazz for all the scandinavians.
---
just dont use it dude lmao
---
golemald
---
Is that your final answer, or do you want to research this a bit more?
---
Yes, but the fucking big boy streamers don’t have the common decency to tell us which server they intend on joining. Completely selfish move fucking over thousands of people who want to avoid them.
---
I heard golemagg was gonna be overtaken by the spanish, so shazz it is!
---

As said 3 times in here it, this doesn't matter at all.

Old wow your stats &gt; item level. You can't get a good picture of a player's skill or build from glancing at an ilvl
---
You had a shit computer. Hopefully you have resolved this.
---
Mine!!
---
loss*
---
This is also not the reason and that's consolidates my opinion that most people here are not the brightest candles on the cake
---
&gt;How do you ensure somewhat equal distribution between the layers?
---
Recommend the least popular layer to new players.
---
&gt;What if you're on Herod-1 and it gets wildly overpopulated?
---
Then merge the layers

---
Read the damn comments, many people are complaining about layering bugs and npc disappearing isn't the only problem....  And that's been happening for players that have only played a few hours, Now imagine how many time this will bug for the average player during the many they will play. 
---
EVERYONE will encounter layering bugs eventually ruining your immersion and play session.
---
Gnome warrior
---
Because that did not work out at the private servers, big brain.
---
The only reason you organized that was because of that fact that it was a stress test you retard. You think people are gonna do that when classic first launches? Use your head
---
Wow, what an antagonistic and idiotic response. Way to call out people who don’t agree with you as “retarded” and “incapable of critical thought.” Your bullshit makes me hope you get layered every 90 seconds.
---
Well you aren't the first person to make this post. Streamers dont care where we go sadly Haha. They will go where they want and the retards will follow.
---
Honestly I'm pretty confident 75% will quit after a month
---
We don’t have to “wait by”. It’s literally not that serious.
---
I’m in this boat as well!  Rolling a human warlock on a pvp sever in EU. Send me a message and we can be bnet friends!

class buffs matter
---
food buffs matter
---
potions matter
---
bandages matter
---
quest reward buffs matter
---
quest reward limited use items are almost gamebreaking
---
Each layer is still about the size of a vanilla server, so it does nothing to solve overpopulation in the starter zones.
---
I'll just do that... Thanks 😅
---
Dude, I'm not falling for it. I made a perfectly polite comment and it's hilarious that you think gaslighting me is going to work.
---
proccing on-hit enchants are worthless for druids (fiery, for example).
---
*Approves This Message*
---
As someone who has been out of the WoW scene for a long time, coming back for Classic is pretty wild with these “Turf Wars” for servers 😂
---
healers weren't too hard to level in vanilla (priests specifically, before dual talent spec.)  on the other hand, you can heal between fights, which doesnt sound like much, but beats the hell out of eating or bandaging between fights with first aid. IMO classes who cant heal are at a significant disadvantage to classes who can.
---
They decided to extend the server up time through the weekend to Monday.
---
He's amassed a large following because of his personality. He's a brutally honest and trashy to a comedic degree, thus people like him. Entertainment is subjective, and his humor is received in 2 different extremes: People love it or despise it.
---
I've watched a few videos, he can be an asshole sometimes and just a guy with a reasonable opinion other times. *most* the time he is an asshole/high and mighty it feels almost like a joke to me. But idk, maybe if I saw more of his stuff it would become more clear that hes a jerk.
---
This is fucked!
---
To force the to either turn off the stream or leave the server entirely.
---
Yeah i was one of those people. I was wrong 100% shit is not good at all
---
I think it's fine, anything too harsh can easily be reported/hidden.
---
But maybe that's because I've been to places that are actually "toxic".
---
Ja pierdole
---
Generally you're just going to level with whatever damage tree your class offers (shadow, enhancement/elemental, retribution, feral). Collect intellect gear to wear when you're healing dungeons etc.
---
Oh that comment was sarcasm. I trust blizzard. I expect phasing to be turned off well before phase 2 based on how past expansion launches have been. Blizzard is pretty good at handing these kinds of things.
---
Thanks, not sure if I should risk setting them up or just try to grab the name lol.
---
HAHA alright “genius”.... enlighten us...
---
The fear-mongering of streamers and the hive-mind that jumped on board with it has strikingly similarities to what happens in politics. It's a got a "get those immigrant invaders out here" vibe to it from what I can see.
---
Which is why we are announcing Idlecraft, a clicker mobile game based in the Warcraft universe. It has micro transactions.
---
Nat Pagle knows the location of the Ashbringer so I'm rolling on his server.
---
That progress isn’t being saved to your account is it?
---
you can do 2x speed on youtube ;)
---
He's right, you are posting about it everywhere. I've seen your name in every thread with this topic now lol.
---
Coming from the guy who spoils Game of Thrones endings to people on a subreddit about shemales

yeah essentially like its one thing if leaders just start giving all the loot to friends but if you sign up knowing the leader is going to prioritise his gear over others thats another thing. 
---
If a warrior joins esfands guild and has a cry when he gets some 2 hander or trinket first its really the warriors fault

I was able to get omen installed last night, haven’t tested it much
---
leave it to blizzard to mess up making a game they already made 15 years ago
---
I know this is an old post but, $7.50? They show as $15 a month for me, is there some discount you can get somewhere?
---
I agree but its simple to make it clear they wont be welcome there. making asmon cry because hes bad at pvp wont be all that hard
---
You can't keep layering with world boss.
---
Queues ? 47k queues 
---
Free transfer ? Do you really expect 90% of the server population to transfer ?
---
The tourists won't directly notice, but they'll leave thinking to themselves "Where is that 'community' everyone talked about? I guess it was just nostalgia after all". They won't even know that layering is what caused them to leave.
---
It was never announced but people don't trust Blizzard. They haven't announced what zones have layers and how long after release will layering be uses. I personally don't trust them, I think they keep the layers for a long time.
---
23ms for west coast, 57ms for east coast

---
On top of working a full time job or going to school? You are a better man than me. Yes, I assumed your gender.
---
This sucks because the purpose of the stress test is to practice your route for your launch, not to give Blizzard a realistic playground to fiddle with the values.
---
Looking forward to killing Magni and Bolvar!
---
I’m not posting anything. I’m just commenting dude. 
---
Sorry. Is reddit not a place for comments? Am I not supposed to be commenting on threads people post?
---
I don’t watch any WoW streamers. Does this person work for blizzard?
---
Considering you responded to the guy who said "your girlfriend won't let u play wow?" With "I can't play 8-12 hours of WoW", I assumed that's what you were getting at, and that's a justified assumption.
---
It’s piss easy compared to pservers, there’s no real difficulty in any of classic leveling.
---
I had ‚ buff pls, ty‘ copy Pasted and its Working
---
Imo the biggest positive of layering is that hopefully it means 2 hours after release you aren't still level 1 because every quest mob insta dies. I'm fine with layering the first day or two. I just think they should remove it as soon as the population spreads out a bit from the starting zones
---
I still dont see why they cant make layering extremely time limited if its just to smooth launch day. Turn it off after a few days when the starting areas calm the fuck down or something, and disable it in cities and contested zones entirely
---
Also if you have a buff to give first, they'll usually give you one in return.
---
It's copy pasta from a thread i made that did get deleted.
---
I tried this out,it works well if that's what you want.  I need to figure out how to make one for knowing if the target can be feared.  Like Necrosis has, but that addon is full of LUA errors atm and needs an update.
---
&gt; I never told you to fuck off. I wanted to after the astroturf comment, but decided to keep it civil.
---
This is what we call, "a lie". Used by many to distort the truth.
---
Lie all you want, I stated a perfectly civil opinion and you told me I should just go away. You didn't make a point. You didn't make an argument. You just told me to take my opinions on layering and fuck off.
---
And I am treating you with the exact amount of respect an attitude like that deserves. None at all.
---
Comment all you want, pretend you're the civil one all you want. You wont make me go away. You wont make my thoughts on this game go away.
---
&gt;Sharding with larger shards would have been better imo, which is basically what you're asking for.
---
No, I think he's asking for absolutely no sharding/layering at all. As it should be.
---
Then we get dead servers in a month. Its a tough call
---
Yep. I would literally only play this game forever if that becomes a reality.
---
2004 still exists on youtube.
---
People need to chill out about streamers you act like the world is going to end but really all that happens are in game events that wouldn’t be possible with discord or other things
---
It’s basically 7.50 for paying half a month sub for just a name reservation
---
It's going live. It's way too close to release and they still haven't fixed it. Just look at Blizzard's track record. Sucks that after all this time of waiting for classic I'm still just going to end up playing on a private server.
---
Blizzard has to do it as a safety because no one really knows how big the release will be. Blizz when Vanilla launched was not held to nearly the same standards as they are today. If they had no tech in place to deal with server congestion and the servers ended up unusable for days or weeks that would be a huge deal for the company. Times change. The world is full of angry gamers today.
---
Wow one on left looks like garbage. Hard to get the gif to play btw maybe is why some people see no difference
---
Yep, Gleb is right. You can learn it. It's weird though that you can't get the track herbs until lvl 3...
---
Unpopular opinion. We have no idea what the state of servers will be until after launch
---
It's kinda impossible to go deep into resto and still get something good in elemental. However just regular deep resto doesn't actually do that badly in pvp, you can still have some fun. I would recommend going deep resto when you are progressing new content, and once it feels easy smooth you can talk with your guild about going the 30-0-21 so you can own some noobers outside of raids.
---
Use your head a little and you'll get to roughly the same conclusion.
---
No layering in Major cities!
---
Everyone is saying that but hasn't been confirmed by any post or thread I've seen, unlike BR and Thalnos. Also I'm 99% sure the major streamers are rolling on Herod so...
---
How do you target things while moving about?
---
Can and should are two different things. You can avoid Org all together too
---
People dont change so quickly. This game will be very appealing still. Just look at the damn pservers. Their popularity been rising over time. Thousands of people investing lots of time into progressing through the game on a random pirated server ran by fans.
---
gonna speak only in dwarvish so everyone knows how it feels.
---
140 ms isn’t bad plus we have spell batching you’ll be fine
---
the reason you dont understand anything is because youre a dense clown and trying to discuss something with you goes one-way
---
You too mate :)
---
It’s faux french.
---
Kungen was the MT. It's a prio for the entire guild to have him geared.
---
Plans change all the time.
---
Me asking "should we" totally equates to telling people to do something. Quit being a baby
---
Where is my friends
---
This !!!
---
A designated streamer server directly from Blizz will never happen. You and I both know this. The streamers are announcing what server they will be on come Monday, and they've already said where they are \*not\* going. Not much more the streamers can do to accommodate you.
---
love me some naked fruit - count me in
---
If layering is continent wide, then what the fuck just call it a new realm not a new layer.  What is the problem with just having more realms.
---
Yeah. I right click and move the mouse to turn the camera/shift direction, and use keyboard turning only if I'm playing one-handed (got a cat on me, I'm eating, I'm basically half-AFK, etc etc). Because I do need to keyboard turn sometimes for convenience's sake, I don't bind those keys to strafe, which is what most people here suggest.
---
Right click + A and Right click +D are basically strafing.
---
W + right click**&amp;hold** can let you change directions by just moving the mouse around on your mousepad/desk to the left or right. Play around with it for a while until you get the hang of it.
---
It's not the streamers anyone has a problem with (short of a few exceptions of course). It's the slew of special breeds they carry on tow that is the most toxic.
---
4mil sounds high.
---
That said, if it ends up true, it is very easy to add new servers if required.
---
Constructive feedback appreciated ❤
---
Who are you. You write like a wizard. I'll be doing exactly this to play with my troll friend. I had this exact same question all day today
---
The drama oc getting camped like that would make them shittons of money. They'd be screaming at their monitors but I guarantee they would love for this to happen. Would only result in more of their fans joining the server
---
Not wanting to see server communities get ruined by hoards of streamer fanboiz is toxic. 
---
Ok sure...
---
thank you!! thats exactly what I needed to hear. I want to go deep resto because I’m set on healing but obviously not having played classic, I don’t really know how i’ll end up doing in pvp.
---
&gt;How about just merge some servers when we get to that point
---
this has been discussed to death.
---
You have a name you've had your entire career, your server dies.
---
Your server is merged with a new server where someone has your name. What happens?
---
You and half of the people you know are forced to change their names and their guild names, the community which you knew is now fragmented because half of the people had to change up their names.
---
Those blacklisted from your groups will have an opportunity to rebrand themselves with a new name and ninja loot all over again.
---
The economy will suddenly be fucked.
---
Merging realms is just pushing off Layering until a later date with harsher consequences.
---
That has to be the most stupid shit I've ever heard.
---
mostly they added the the tier 0,5 questline and balanced it around 5mans (and UBRS as 10man) strat 45 and valthalak wouldnt have been challenges if they could have been cheesed with 10/15 people.
---
Here's one Esfand recommended me a while back. It's what I plan on using.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/A8zUxAAEzM3zMA
---
I'll find it when I'm not at work but i remember seeing a thread about it, granted its impact is nowhere near BR and streamers so it's probably the safe bet still
---
Blacklist people who blacklist people. Eye for an eye.
---
Shut up and put on your big boy pants on and deal with it
---
When/how do I download the client for name reserves tomorrow? And why is it during work hours :/
---
And why so fucking few realms? Are they actually insane
---
For the Horde!!!
---
With regard to ping, Ziqo was streaming the stress test from Sweden and getting 130ms ping which isn’t too bad for vanilla with spellbatching and leeway and what not.
---
Alright, so what is your solution? At least mine actually works.
---
Is yours simply for all streamers to stop streaming? Poof? Solved?
---
Or are you suggesting they announce what server they're playing on so that people can avoid? Because they'll do that when name reservation goes live. Literally all streamers care about is getting their names reserved and playing with their friends. Once they've reserved their names, there's no downside to announcing, so they'll announce, and everyone gets their way.
---
Worst case scenario, they don't announce, and you literally only have to wait one hour after true launch and MAYBE will not get the opportunity to pick your name. However, unless you're going to name your character something popular and not unique, you probably don't have to worry about that anyway.
---
So, what's your solution?
---
100% agree. Mind boggling when they first argued and even worse now that we have multiple examples of the downsides. This is what makes modern wow suck, and ANY form of layers form shards or any of that is community splitting at best and game killing at worst. It has no place in classic at all.
---
I’m on Fairbanks! We’re gonna be the best server
---
  Should only would
---
Come again?
---
another discord server is exactly what we need.
---
The Activision Blizzard buisnessmen really like to hear this.
---
&gt;the beta
---
Didn't experience any mana breaks pre-10 as druid this weekend. If you play smart w/ the 5-second rule you should be able to end most fights near full mana. As you said, the last 5-10 seconds of the fight should be moonfire+rejuv ticks with melee whacks. At most you'll need a healing touch after and you're still at 80-90% mana.
---
Heck, that's a Cataclysm picture, old model orc, the old Warchief's Command Board, Eye of the Storm BG event. Higher effort, but couldn't be bothered to take their own screenshot
---
As an orc warlock i have to disagree, i wont feel special

They won't do it for this. They will give you a day of paid time to renew your account with your in-game gold, but they only do this like once a year or something.
---
Of course he is a dwarf, lol
---
Fuck layering, give us vanilla for the love of god
---
I disagree. It's true, the more people in major city, the better. But the point of layering (in theory) was to split the server in slices which would remain somewhat separated so that you wouldn't feel their effect as much as sharding. If you disable them in major city, you will shard in and out of them during gameplay all the time, it will feel like you are entering an instance when running out. They already have enough instances where it moves you around as a bug, I'd rather have them focus on that.
---
Yeah, “new copyright laws” has been regurgitated for a decade. Blizzard has no power outside NA
---
By fire do you mean a small loud group of people complaining about every little thing? Don't get me started on streamer circle jerk hate threads either. They want to feel like their opinions are right all the time
---
I have not agreed on anything, I think there should not be layering (preferably at all but at least not as they currently are) but a lot more servers instead. 
---
Reality is that we will have layers and I doubt they will get rid of them by Phase 2 as they have promised unless they add a lot more realms and give free transfers but honestly I'd like to see that avoided altogether.
---
My thoughts exactly. Even if Spain and/or LA were rolling Faerlina it's still better than the alternatives by a large margin.
---
How Long Will Layering Be Used?
---
If you dislike layering, worry not. Layering will only be used for a couple of weeks or maybe a month at the start of Classic WoW, in order to balance the huge influx of players in the same zones. Once the situation reaches a controlled state, it will be completely disabled and realms will once more have one instance of themselves. Layering also will not happen after Phase 1
---
The only downside I can really see is you don't get a trinket that makes you immune to fear for 30 seconds. Lots of fun in BGs. But it requires you to do a series of quests where you hand in lots of mithril and iron bars.
---
if we make more servers, we will get more people on that realm. It all makes sense!
---
Nice day for a funeral
---
No one knows it’ll be announced at blizz con
---
it looked so much better in vanilla, its so janky now
---
Yes, but reading is for nerds
---
This is what almost every f2p MMO does. You don't even have to relog to switch channels in most MMO's that have this system. The problem with having channels though, is that it makes it even easier to abuse resources.
---
I know a guy that's gonna do the same. Already camped a few people during beta for a few hours straight.
---
Even tho it's in text I read it with an accent and still got a headache. Also I'm from cali so thanks for the shout out.
---
I tagged it NSFW when I posted it. A line in the song says, "Grab your dick and double-click, porn, porn, porn." That's NSFW where I work lol
---
Elemental IMO is one the most fun specs for PvP. Amazing burst and survival. Although it takes to about AQ to get geared for Elemental.
---
I actually took over and modified a spell scaling add-on bank then, forgot about that.
---
I'm going have to dig it up if curse hasn't deleted it.
---
Ok fair enough, didn't realize it would be in the same category as something like that, that makes sense.
---
This is sharding
---
Same.
---
Yeah like that addon once in retail where you could hop layers. We will definitely see that again.
---
Reee streamers are gonna ruin the whole game because I can't see myself type in chat reeeee
---
Says the person acting like a baby.
---
Let's see in a couple of weeks. Everyone can agree that this game is about slow grinding and there's no real difficulty. I doubt this appeals to the kids who are using spreadsheets to figure out what class to play.
---
We (wow hungary classic) have a facebook group and our guilds and mods chose golemagg and mirage raceway.
---
I know some of the comments are just joking but holy FUDGE
---
It depends on what you want. If you have a 120Hz or higher monitor 200% render scale will most likely make you not hit that fps. But if you don't care about that then the game will look a bit better with a bit lower fps.
---
I'm running a 144Hz monitor and want to stay as close to that as I can since it's nice to play with a smooth as butter fps, so I just run 100% render scale with 4x MSAA at 1080p (monitor is 32:9, 3840x1080 res)
---
pve?
---
Glad it's a private server bug! It was strenuous as hell to keep toggle between wand and autoattack! Now just dot, toggle wand and let go of keyboard.
---
Holy cow this just gave me so much flashback.  I now remember like 90% of the players from this one server were absolutely terrible at the video game.  When I saw their server queue with me I knew I was in for a bad time.  None of them spoke English.
---
Item level doesn’t matter because some lower level items are bis.
---
Don't give the Aussies ammo g
---
I think you came at me with no arguments, no reasons, no logic. You just told me to go away when you didn't like my civil comment. 
---
So now I'm just dicking around with you. Because I don't respect your shitty tactics or behaviors. 
---
But to answer your question. Yes. You are either literally astroturfing, or you are doing their work for them. I said the only way to get rid of layering was by voicing our displeasure, by making it known how much we don't want it in the game. I stated the fact that I wont be playing if they keep it in longer than they promised. And you want me to just take my opinions and fuck off.
---
I don't really care what you are after that. You're not even worth the effort it would take to figure out if all those other accounts with less than 5k karma all with the same shitty attitude belong to the same person or not.
---
Instead I'll just point out that you're being a cock and a half and your shitty tactics wont work on me.
---
Uh, no. Read all 80+ pages of EU's new Article 13. ISPs will soon have to block consumer access to offending sites/servers after receiving a notice from the copyright owner.
---
Friend is trying to install the client, but they have no "Version" tab above the play button. Any ideas? They are only interested in classic.
---
On [this battle.net page](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/7870) you can find the IPs for America, Europe, Korea, Taiwan and Oceania, but China uses [a different web](https://www.battlenet.com.cn/support/zh/) and I don't speak Chinese, so dunno, sorry
---
I used Dom bars.
---
Asserting dominance, I like it.
---
I actually had someone say they’d rather see gold farmers than tokens too
---
Running servers on bare metal isn't going to happen in 2019.
---
This kills the game for me
---
You're opinion is unpopular for a reason; it's shiite.
---
I need a cigarette
---
 Lok'tar *ogar* !!!
---
haha are you me
---
Yeah I feel layering should be turned off for cities
---
Blizzard misrepresenting a future system to make it sound better? Fans taking small bits of info greatly out of context to make them sound drastically better than they ever would be in practice and being burned?
---
Goodness who could have seen this coming.
---
It’s the nonsense about not having gameplay without layering. You are incredibly misinformed if you really believe that.
---
Elvui currently works, it’s in an alpha stage but I had no problems with it
---
good riddance
---
Sure, 1% of 1% of 1% of the issue
---
Oh, I see what you're saying. I don't think so, KOS lists and blacklists are pretty old concepts. I don't think these streamers have nearly the influence in WoW that they think they do, with the exception of maybe asmon. Even then I never see people /spit on store mounts, so I dunno.
---
Ele/resto ofc.
---
Only if all Brazilians are Mexicans.
---
I know plenty of really old games that people play because they are good, even though they cost a lot of money. I play physical TCGs too. A ton of people in that community drops 500 dollars a month on cards, by a ton I mean hundreds of thousands of people. Acting as if this 15 dollars barrier is going to stop grown people from playing something is quite honestly silly. Ofcourse it limits the potential playerbase, but not down to less than 1% of the world lmao
---
Work and video games is about all I do and the most I can usually manage is about 6 - 8 hours if i'm pushing it. I can't live off of 4 hours of sleep a day lol. I will probably try and regret it for the first week though.
---
How can one decide? You can't possibly avoid everyone and everyhing you want to avoid. Really don't know what to do.
---
"it's just a BEEEEEETA"
---
"it's just a STRESS TEEEEEST"
---
"it's just PHASE OOOOOONE"
---
Every. Fucking. Time.
---
Selection bias.
---
For a reddit only server, sure, it will probably be representative.
---
However, it won't even be close to a reddit only server, nor does the reddit represent the majority of classic players.
---
No because mexicans have japanese eyes too.
---
we dont
---
I’d die in that cave even without layering respawning everything.
---
Imagine fearing a streamer.
---
Imagine thinking words can hurt you.
---
Grobmob!
---
Merging servers obliterate server community
---
If by that you mean that they can't enable sharding without enabling cross-realm, you're wrong.
---
Unrelated but the way you just jump around like a child clicking on passerby's like "hello mr warlock, hello mr shaman", then freeze and double back when everyone disappears made me laugh for some reason.
---
Then it's PW: Fortitude and Arcane Intellect.
---
Seeing 5-6 raids gathered up near the portal back in 2005 wasn't unusual. When we see 10+ raids going in MC with their booming roster. How will phasing work then ?? What if the "layer" has the opposition members stacked there. ?? Will I be able to ress raid members when they get nuked near the raid portal, but are in a different phase.
---
The ore magically disappearing right before you mine it is commonly mis-linked to sharding. In BFA when you mine or herb the node stays for 20 seconds, it's more likely someone else picked it 20 seconds ago.
---
It CAN vanish due to sharding, but just not as often, it can also vanish because it's in an area that phases due to a quest, so when you get near it you're getting into the "phase area" where it'll vanish
---
Be UD so you can get naked and show some bone in thanks.
---
No. Server mergers are painful, never forced, and have too many consequences. The entire purpose of Layering is to prevent them.
---
I was just challenging him. I know MoveAnything is a good addon even in the new client.
---
More than layering?
---
at least he died happy
---
sharding = layering
---
if it stays the way it is now it certainly will drive a lot of vanilla enthusiasts away.
---
Then we'd likely end up with more than a handful of dead servers.
---
If you want to REALLY make a warrior happy, heal them to full after buffing them.
---
No. Because servers are not free, they have a cost and why would any company throw money into a fire? Layering is fine and seems to work perfectly. It's not expected to last the entire time of classic. Just the beginning.
---
Fun fact: Its been stated that layers are intended to hold an amount of players approximately equal to the old server caps. That means 500+ players in the same starting area, even with layering. It's going to be a shitfest despite layering. It's so dumb...
---
Complaining about every single thing developers are doing doesn't seem enough, y'all gotta complain about the community?
---
Aight I get what you're saying, but here's a different perspective:
---
If you're gonna roll on RP-PvP you don't get to ignore the reality of the in game world around you, ever. That's the point of RP-PvP.
---
Most "roleplaying"  on RP realms involves more or less completely ignoring reality and having your characters go off in their own little world to pretend things are happening which arent. You are effectively playing a character that is themselves LARP-ing in game. This is what PvE RP realms are for.
---
If you consider it "bad manners"  to interrupt people's RP with (excessive) PvP then that's fine, roll on the PvE realm. In the real RP realm, the RP-PvP realm, there are shit tons of assholes on the enemy faction, and if you want to live, you can't just stand around and chat about things you imagine going on around you unless you're in a zone under your factions control. 
---
If you decide to hold your event anywhere outside of a safezone great, that's a risk you're choosing to take. Same as if your RL LARP-ing group decided to hold their next session in Afghanistan for that added bit of realism.
---
RP-PvP is PvP first and foremost because that is what MAKES it RP-PvP. The world being dangerous, cruel, and unforgiving is what MAKES it immersive to people who want that kind of realm, not you and your friends RP-ing characters LARPing in-game.
---
TL;DR if you want your character to be a LARPer, with no interference from the opposing faction, go on a PvE  RP realm, if not, accept the risks inherent to an actually dangerous world, even when it's inconvenient to your currently scheduled activity.
---
Holy fuck he seems like cancer.
---
Your experience of the community is what you make it
---
Launch is not 26/27th of august. Launch is when layering is removed.
---
They can't, they fucked themselves.  If no layers in orgrimmar then they will have 10,000 people in orgrimmar given the amount of people they plan on smooshing onto on server with layers.  If they instead make the orgrimmar layer larger, then we will run into the issue with people being dismounted when travelling over major cities or getting separated from their group/people nearby as they walk over the border of the zone.  It's a clusterfuck.
---
Just thinking here, but has anyone considered that they might be testing layers? Changing layer max popluations, Changing the number of layers. Those things might fuck with our experience. But then again, a stresstest is for testing.
---
With my feet
---
As someone who knows he NEEDS a wand. Can you elaborate on the process...
---
/r/CasualRacism
---
Definitely one thing we can agree on. That this is definitely an unpopular opinion.
---
Well its a good thing i do not need you to get gear.
---
Agreed.
---
Spin up more servers. Fuck Layering.
---
i dont believe that, there was a 20k queue and now in barrens I see max 30 people.
---
Which one is worse can't be Quantified. Important thing is however blizzard does it, from then on you are responsible for crafting your community experience
---
I'm neither - I've just actually played the game and have been through enough launches and Beta's to know that launch spam is not at all indicative of how live servers will be.
---
That's my favourite bit too :D
---
I know during the stress test I would level Cooking and save food that gave me stamina and spirit well fed buff.  It was such a huge thing.  One low level quest provided me 5 elixirs that bumped my armor up which was a massive help for lowbie locks pre-voidwalker since you'd be face-tanking.
---
It's not even that.
---
well ofc, with layering there won't form a community to begin with. you can't kill what never lived.
---
Blizzard: gives every Wow Subscriber $1 million.
---
Fans: oh so non subscribers are just SOL?
---
Other fans: great now everyone I know is going to ask me for stuff
---
More fans: handout culture much blizz?  Takes all the fun and challenge out of it
---
Others: we all know they could have afforded to make it 2
---
This already happens in the US. I can't access TPB and some domains while on Comcast.
---
This also is easily defeatable by simply firing up my VPN. People will just play on pservers through a VPN. Latency isn't an issue for most people in the US since these Eastern European servers were already 250ms+ anyway.
---
Hopefully no streamers, although I’ve heard taliesin may be rolling on Gob
---
I mean, no one is in cities right now, why would they be? They’re all in the world
---
No, I'm trying to tell you... again...  
---
Sharding and CRZ are all part of the same tech now. Blizzard doesn't use "CRZ" anymore, it's all one technology that they're calling "sharding" that's it.  
---
It has nothing to do with what blizzard "can or can't" do. They can enable or disable cross realm sharding within the sharding, which I think they do for RP realms(?) but it's all still sharding now.
---
What is layering?
---
Why wouldn't 5000 reddit users be a good representation of the kind of people that are going to play Classic? I'd argue that's exactly the kind of people who are going to be playing lol
---
I got 4 kids. If only I had known classic would come out I would have planned them accordingly!
---
FML... There are 2 pvp servers only for the other 30 countries... And I have no clue where will the polish community go to. And with 50/50 chances i will most likely miss.
---
Then we must all fight together. Form guilds and do our best against the streamer problem
---
Yum pavlova
---
We are Thex, we are Legion:)
---
Level normally and do Bashal'Aran quest at level 10 or so.
---
Truth. Who cares if merges are needed later.
---
It'd be glorious and not empty.  You get my upvote because this is what you meant.
---
it takes as many servers to do 1 realm with 10 layers as 10 realms with 1 layer each
---
Thanks guys
---
Agreed, that’s literally one of the few choke points. After that you could travel to a more remote area for quests.
---
Guilds already advertising will be a small minority of guilds. Are you going to no-job race for world firsts? If not, it REALLY doesn't matter. 5 people killed onyxia.
---
Read this as "obsession with wearing filthy lace dresses " and I can't stop giggling.  Also, Crocodily Dundee is much more fun to say!
---
Is there a trick to farming res gear or just all RNG gated?
---
I gave one out go every individual I saw on my druid. Except if I am fighting mobs ^^
---
I was in it and never was annoyed cause I always could move if I wanted also I only ever saw it 1 time on the last stress test it’s really not a big deal people like you need to chill out about it it’s not like they are screaming in your ear just turn off general chat for a bit or move lol
---
Nobody has their sense of self-worth unhealthily invested in their character/gear yet.  Give it time.
---
this has to be sarcasm.
---
You don't seems to understand how facts work.
---
Most updated character models are butt ugly(the female ones).
---
The only problem with layering right now are the bugs and the fact that it happens so much. If I could go through an entire game session without being dumped into three different layers throughout that time, I wouldn't mind if I'm only playing with a tenth of the people on the server.
---
I'm not hopeful considering Blizzard's record and I'm just expecting my first time in Org will be some sharding bug where I got shunted into a layer that's not supposed to exist and there's only 20 people scattered across the city. 
---
I don't see people getting moved from one full layer to another full layer. I see them get dropped into player deserts as the 30 or 40 players in front of them are just gone now.
---
Me + another priest buddy did that.
---
One time during the lunar event (i think) we took a horde caster (can't remember the class) all the way into ironforge and to the area in front of the mage trainers were the event was being held.
---
An annoying, but now quite funny, side-effect was that the patrolling arathi basin guys somehow became hostile to me and chased me all over until I ran out of the city a ways.
---
Thalnos bud.  Herod is where supposedly they are going to congregate.  I think there is a web site called avoidstreamers.com with the lists for when they commit.
---
you are the most retarded person on reddit, congratulations
---
Legion was rad though
---
Thanks, I hate it
---
Lmao this game is DOA with this shit.
---
Their massive guild be in charge of who ranks.  if you're not in their guild, it's not you.
---
Reddit accounts are worthless and take two seconds to remake, which is why moderators are so important. It's up to them how much the rules are enforced because if people want to be dicks they can, easily.
---
I invited my friend the other day, brand new orcs in Durotar, and it took up to 15-20 seconds for us to be able to see each other. Just some anecdotal input
---
Trashvision-Blizzard managed to ruin it again LOL
---
 If it actually was closer it wasn't closer by much. It was just in LOS to the AH. You have to run around a corner in SW to get to the mailbox and bank.
---
imo it's almost as bad to be a horde warlock and getting your DoTs dispelle instantly by paladins in group PvP.
---
Plus when you're alliance you can make a shaman's life miserable with Curse of Tongues :)
---
Priest or hunter
---
Grab your dick and double click
---
You should be in the same layer as your raid. So yes, you will be able to resurrect the other members
---
I love it when people have such an amazing story with new people in classic! 
---
This is what MMORPGs are suppost to be like!! Meeting new friends and journeying with them till the end
---
They are worried that once the retail crowd sees how long leveling takes in classic they will stop playing. Leaving servers empty. 
---
I think they are wrong but we will have to wait and see.
---
Peep flair
---
its 3 names for whatever server you please so you can 1 on server A one of server B and one of server C or all 3 on A or B or C it really is upto you
---
For sure, but if you disagree you disagree, we are just guessing.
---
I already considered that in the reply you responded to.
---
Re-reading I shouldn't of been so absolute in that second to last sentence, but as I said, I'd wager the majority of classic players won't be active enough reddit users to bother with the poll.
---
Which is why it's rather worrying. Not a lot of time to fix it.
---
This just in, strange game breaking things happened when servers are stressed.
---
I'm more interested in picking a PvP server that isn't 70%+ Horde. I don't really care about the steamers or anything, I just want a good population. I spent years looking for a server to call home and I'm not about to re-do it. It's looking like Faerlina will be the way to go in that regard.
---
looks like it
---
Seek help. The real world is more important. This is not your life.
---
It bothers me greatly that your unit frames are not aligned.
---
There is no shared tagging in classic... Trying to kill 10 wolves in North shore on launch would be insane... Let alone fucking boar livers in Westfall
---
There are 2 **PVP** EU server, the total number is 6
---
Is it the number that matters? What if a guild got 100 of their members to login, and the GM told them through discord (or otherwise) to camp a specific player. Should that GM be banned? Fuck no. It's PvP. Coordinating consequences for players who do shitty things is not against ToS. Deciding who you don't want to play with and blocking said people from grouping with you (and or your friends/guildies) is not against ToS. 
---
If you don't want to be blacklisted, then just don't be a shitty human who would stream snipe. If you do stream snipe, then prepare for the consequences. It's only fair, right? You're making use of outside resources to get an edge in-game, therefore the streamer will as well (his influence).
---
Looks like lag, not anything to do with instancing or layering.
---
On my hunter, I would keep food/fishing up to date and give sway stat food. It was my way of buffing people.
---
If you look at the chat, Looks like the game tried to place me back into Elwynn Forest and that failed. So it dumped me back into Westfall.
---
&gt;The other cities had their auction houses added in 1.9,
---
This isn't true. Those auction houses always existed in the release version of the game. Patch 1.9 is what linked all faction auction houses together.
---
I can understand why so many people are confused by this, though. Even I thought there were no other auction houses until I read the [patch notes](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_0.8) for myself. It is just that no one ever visited those AHs so they might as well not have even existed in the first place.
---
And the stress test demonstrating the same behaviour doesn't lead you to believe they're still testing it?
---
gl with JAJAJAJAJAJ KKKKKKK JAJAJAJAJJA no hablo ingles jajajajaaj
---
Honestly at that point it just needs to be that the merges are offered optionally to servers super low pop until the amount of people who would be affected by issues caused by the merge and players having the existing names etc. are at a minimum. At some point we have to realize that this everyone wins shit doesn’t work.
---
Those low numbers on EU PvE realms are kinda worrying, I get it that only fraction of people planning to play classic is on reddit and probably even less took the survey but still, those are rookie numbers  :/
---
I keep seeing Skinning (so you can vendor all the skins for more gold for mount/skills) &amp; tailoring.
---
I learned that I will never roll a Tauren Hunter. That hitbox makes huntering painful
---
Off topic but that's a cool map. Does anyone know where can I find that wolrd map with out the city names?
---
Then we don't have to fucking pay for it either then.
---
Do me a favour and run dungeons with 4 other people, I don't care if you pick the best possible setup. Go as a 5 man group and I swear I will out-level your ass just by questing at the same speed I normally do.
---
There's no way you will out-level a person that is actively questing, no way.
---
&gt; I am not interested in paying for Blizzard's new version of this experience. 
---
So don't play.  No one gives a fuck if you do or if you don't.
---
Holy shit your post history is fucking depressing. 
---
I hope you get the help you need, but I'm guessing that ship has sailed.
---
I don't think so. If the server or myself were lagging, then the Night Elf hunter next to me would also look like it's lagging.
---
Lmao. That is all.
---
This blog sucks
---
You think your pc can handle a 4K tv?
---
I don't understand the issue with a server with a lot of streamers.
---
They said at some point that they wanted to make the paladin the easiest class to play. You can dps and heal, and possibly even tank a little.
---
In very serious hardcore guilds they mostly only use paladins for healing, but since you are new that is probably not a big issue, I guess.
---
Can’t tell if you’re being serious but this doesn’t look like a product of layering
---
Servers are layered. 
---
You can DL client now from blizzard app on desktop.
---
I think they start midnight paris time.
---
No one here seems to realise that the auction house and economy is going to be MAJORLY F\*\*\*ED up with so many layers in one realm
---
Sorry.
---
Perfectly unbalanced, as all things should be.
---
That’s not layering it’s obviously lag
---
AFAIK they can because cities are not instanced. A layer is basically a shard  stretching across the whole continent.
---
Not necessarily.
---
jesus christ you are dumb as fuck.
---
How is that announcing a Swedish only server? They are gathering Nordic guilds on one of two servers.
---
can i see people from other layers write in /2 tradechat or /4 LookingForGroup etc? 
---
if one server have average 50k players (most likely) theres gonna be alot of messages in the chat, that means it could be 5000 players in barrens-chat 1 week after launch.
---
I mean, okay, passionate letter from a loving van, but really really in need of a reality check here. I very sincerely doubt anyone complaining about 2000 people in a queue to log in not being representative of the original Vanilla WoW experience actually played Vanilla WoW in 2005.
---
I know you absolute fuck probably started playing in legion or bfa but let me try to explain it to you:
---
Back in the days people on the server weren't anonymous. You literally knew 95% of the server because you saw them ALL THE TIME.
---
This kills every form of community or possibility to make friends without having to group with them every single time you log in.
---
As soon as cross realms started, the game got a lot shittier for me.
---
this will either get removed soon by the mods or the shills will brigade it. its sad becoz its a nice read.
---
Mages don't get invisibility until TBC, but the breathing buff is nice nonetheless.
---
Apes will prolly go Shazz. Why would they go Golemagg now that it is less popular
---
Nah, it's just lag.  People used to die and slide across the ground all the time.  This is just the same thing but he didn't get to see the slide.
---
Not sure how to use "bind other" it only gives me options of target clicked unit, open unit menu, and run custom macro.
---
&gt; Blizz “KnOw wUT THeY dOin”
---
I think the idea behind layering is good, the question is if they can make it work. Sadly it still looks like the system has major flaws
---
If you look at chat, it spits out "Transfer aborted: Instance not found" after being killed.
---
Unless there’s going to be fresh realms at some point there’s no reason to rush the phases. The game isn’t going anywhere, and we’ll potentially only get to experience the content rollout once.
---
I would say Dwarf. Nelf is definitely the meta for alliance but the feeling of being a dwarf hunter like the one in the cinematic is just so pleasant.
---
They talk big but I would put money that the other faction wont give a fuck and probably promote ganking on their dumb asses
---
You’re right. But the social side is key to an mmo.
---
You don't have to spec healer to heal dungeons while leveling. Just play a dps spec and you will be fine for both healing and solo
---
&gt;I stated the fact that I wont be playing if they keep it in longer than they promised.
---
Maybe I misunderstood you then. The way I understood it from the first of your comments that I replied to was that you would not be playing the game if layering was part of it. Not that you would quit playing of it wasn't removed as planned.
---
From my perspective, you came of as a troll who has no intention of playing the game, but just wants to rage and complain while ruining the fun for the rest of us. That's why I suggested you go away.
---
I'm gonna play for a couple of hours, get a bit peeved when I get layered twice while in durotar, and then just quit when I inevitably get shunted into some bugged layer when I first enter Org and see that there's only like 12 people in the entire city.
---
Layers can work but they can't fix the bugs that are ruining it. There aren't that many mobs in Org that need to be fought over (like ... literally only one isn't there?) so why do there need to be *any* layers at all for it? Why are layers still so lopsided? Why aren't they localized so everyone in Durotar is divided evenly into the necessary number of layers?
---
All I've seen is people being layered away from their groups, layered into levels with almost no players, layered into empty regions, or layered from a large level into a player desert.
---
Fine, you can't have 1,000 players in the starting zone during hour one. But why the hell does that mean I should end up in a layer where there's only 2 people around me? Why do I go to the barrens only to find half a dozen?
---
It will be fine.  I used to play on AUS servers from NA and it didn't ruin my game.

---
Its continent wide, but yes as soon as the population settles after the first couple weeks or so they are removing it
---
Admittedly there was nothing official that said so and I don’t know where it is but I think there was an interview that said offhand that it would just be starting zones.
---
As someone elsewhere said. The systems and performance gained is good. But it’s at the cost of social performance. Which we all know is very important to a mmorpg.
---
I would look at vids and see which ones you like the play style of.
---
A lot of the easy classes are pretty boring too level. 
---
Easy class is Hunter. Hard to master. 
---
Not real popular in late game raiding but good for wpvp.
---
I'm not pro layering by any means but if you're referring to the stress test do you not think that people are out and about leveling and playing? It's not there's an economy. People aren't buying / selling in the auction house. There's no point in grinding professions. People aren't grouping for dungeons, etc.
---
I bought a low end gaming laptop with a SSD hard drive to able to play more on the fly as a dad with a baby and toddler! Great investment so far!
---
Yeah I logged into retail and everything was clown world. Wacky mounts with vendors on them, oversized / flashy everything. I saw dudes from other realms, like, the heck? Only cool thing was interacting with NPC's or targeting other players turned the models head a bit.
---
Layers aren’t substantially cheaper than more servers
---
At that level I’d probably just sinister strike and eviscerate. Things shouldnt be alive long enough to need snd. Did you do the level 10 rogue quest? And yeah... we die a lot till we start getting gear.

What skills should a undead priest learn? Enchanting/tailoring?
---
Sorry, started in 2006. And I guess if your definition of knowing somebody is having seen them before, if that's what gives you a sense of community, then get those people together in a guild. Or a Discord server. Blizzard is going to release the game they're going to release, from there it's up to you to make the community experience you like.
---
Try pinging the LA data center and make sure your latency is decent. Some of my east coast guild members have complained of 200+ ping on that server.

I honestly always got the impression that the conservative shit he says is most often for fun. I've heard many of him and McConnells rants end up with a socialist conclusion, which they tongue in cheek treat like it's a revolutionary conservative idea. Maybe I just have too much faith in humanity and I'm reading sarcasm into it though, lol.
---
Do you really think servers will have 50k active players per server? I very seriously doubt that will be an issue. We'll see.
---
Nice try, but no. The difference between underwear and shoe is not even close to that between a horribly derogatory term for a woman to whatever endearment some Australians may have for the word. It's so murky that it really is better that as a rule the word is treated as explicit
---
Blizzard won’t but the anti classic trolls certainly will. 
---
Can’t wait for the screenshots of dead capital realms week one due to shitty layering with titles like “lul dead game, thought you did but you didn’t.” Etc..
---
GMs aren't actually GM's and haven't been for over a decade. They're all call center employees reading from a script with zero actual in game power.
---
Yea curious too. Thanks for this.
---
 Happen to know the lowest vendor wand we can buy? 
---
I am rolling undead, but I dunno if I just want to buy one from someone else or set up that money maker myself 😂
---
Awesome! I have friends from all over the US so I wanted to be certain I could play with them all. I don't want to be the guy who says no to playing with them because server location and I don't want them to feel like they have to step out of their server preference to come play on East coast just for me.
---
They definitely do, the current biggest one does, at the very least. They wouldn't be able to handle 10k+ pop otherwise. I should precise the phasing is between zones and you obviously don't have multiple "phases" on a single zone.
---
I've had numerous times where I could see a gathering node on both my minimap and screen only to have them disappear when moving closer because I went in a different phase. 
---
The border between elwynn and redridge is another big offender.
---
Call it however you want. It's not layering nor sharding but it's there on pservers.
---
Good job Thex  ! Following event  : to kill a murloc with hands  ?
---
Ask in area chat for a group for x quest.
---
Makes quests fly by and pretty good chance a healer will join
---
No layering either means huge wait times just to log in, or more servers, which will be empty in 2 months
---
You guys wanted classic, you got classic!
---
... just wait for layering to be removed and then you can have your precious cup of nostalgia...
---
I know he's trolling, but just because few of the have agreed to roll on one server doesnt mean that every streamer will do the same.
---
Dont let your servers be overtaken by these guys
---
And in what way will it effect you
---
Layering and sharding are completely different from a technical standpoint,  they still havent nbn used any sharding afaik.
---
I don't know much about warriors in PvP. In classic is it either going to be battlegrounds or world PvP. There is no arena. So you will be playing in larger teams and you can therefore play well with anything. That being said, I read that priest + warrior has some of the best leveling. The priest fixes some of the biggest problems with warriors (lack of sustain). So maybe try a priest? That being said, since you are new you should really play whatever you want and think will be fun. There is a very long way to 60 if you don't like your class
---
It was always awesome to get randomly buffed at very low levels and equally devastating when you inevitably died.
---
VC is possible to fully complete. We got it down last night with 1 warrior 1 priest 2 mages and a hunter
---
Yeah but not because of them.
---
The servers theyre on will probably have the biggest decline in players after a while since most fanboys are just hyped like they were for dayz, pubg etc.
---
If you really want to go on a server with stable pop i recommend rp servers. Those players are the least likely to quit after a week imo.
---
Just follow the rp rules when you do.
---
It won't ever be 50k in one general chat.  For that to happen you would need 200,000 people on one server.  It's just basic math:
---
4 horde factions:
---
* orc + troll = 50k
---
* undead = 25k
---
* cow = 25k
---
4 alliance with a similar distribution.
---
Don't make stupid arguments.
---
I know it's not a super popular opinion around here, but I don't think retail is in all that dire a situation. I certainly wouldn't put it at Warlords of Draenor bad.
---
I’ll be doing skinning and herbalism until 60. Then I will drop both and grab tailoring and enchanting
---
&gt; It feels a bit weird to talk about performance issues on a 15yo game.
---
I thought just installing WoW Classic was a good reminder of this. I had to update like 15GBs of WoW Retail before it finally let me choose the WoW Classic option from the drop down list. And that one? Like 2GB for the whole game.
---
Honestly i prefer server merges if there is a huge drop in subs rather than this shit.
---
He's just trolling. Do you really think he will have enough time to stream multiple servers + retail? He's saying this just to trigger people. Seems like he succeeded.
---
Don’t kill the streamer, kill the fans that rabidly trying to surround them imo.
---
You are correct, I used to run dedicated private servers 12 years ago on dual core machines with 1gb of RAM, it's how i learnt SQL. Todays servers and modern efficient programming should easily handle this. Idk why they're even bothering with layering, if the server is busy then it will be like how it's meant to be.   
---
Not that there would be problems but even having a high 100 to 200ms ping would be authentic.
---
this isn't layering at this point, its phasing
---
True, back to private servers it is.
---
Well then don't play the game if you don't think devs are going to fix bugs that bother you
---
I would love to have a few shamans for the totems they bring.
---
Nobody is suggesting 300 servers, there is no way they would be ghost towns after only one month, and there's no reason why it would take six months for a server mege.  It's very convenient that you grossly exaggerate the points in favour of your argument and grossly exaggerate the points against the opposing argument.  Your entire comment is worthless.
---
Numbers sort of matter way more when they're actually comprehendable. +5 to +12 strength is noticable. When something starts providing +350 you don't really care that much when you get a new thing with +360.
---
There’s a reason for that. A number of factors indicates that the main use blizzard sees for classic is to get people back into playing retail. They have good reason to want that, as the cash shop there will make them far more money than classics subs. For one, the games location on the launcher is an easy example of this. 
---
The longer reasons are that, at least a large chunk of probably corporate elements in the company never wanted classic to happen. There are a number of good videos on YouTube that break down why classic was made, and while a large bit of the credit goes to devs like Omar, the main reason it took this long is very likely those corporate elements. The whole “you think you do, but you don’t” etc. it’s entirely possible as well that there is infighting in the company about the game and that it suffers as a result.
---
Yep.  What people don't seem to get is this is exactly what killed World PVP in retail.  There was one coherent world in a realm.  PVP Guilds would watch Local Defense channel and see what towns were under attack and defend them.
---
Once sharding was introduced, it made no sense because now there were all these shards or layers of different reality where towns were both under attack and not under attack.
---
It’s pitiful.
---
You make it sound like other gaming communities are not toxic, go play league of legends or overwatch or Dota 2 and then tell me classic is toxic
---
but its not a new game?
---
The European union don't or Europe doesn't?
---
This is some cringe stuff
---
They do it in reverse. So they ping your ip-address which is dropped by your router/firewall. Enable it on WAN and it should work!
---
Thanks for the tips...any suggestions for professions? Is it easiest to just do herbs/mining/skinning for gold or in classic do you need to have a specific crafting profession?
---
Looking through the post histories of most of the people saying this is a dealbreaker for them... I couldn't be more thankful for layering. It's pissing off the exact people that made me worry about the classic community.
---
If I had the time to watch streams, yours is probably the one I'd watch, or Smooth McGroove.
---
I've mostly watched opinion, news pieces and reviews about vanilla WoW pservers and there were few other channels that were bearable - Orcbit and Dodgykebaab. Not much else.
---
Okay, so is there something wrong with me getting a nice TV or is it just unnecessary?
---
All of phase 1, which is going to be more like 2-3 months.
---
Dungeons are also way more enjoyable. Part of it is trying to kill level 19 bosses when we're level 15, but healing in dead mines as a druid is intense.
---
Oh my god these posts are non-stop.
---
Go play the stress test or something. GO DO SOMETHING.
---
Imagine caring this much about a 1/50th of a second difference.
---
hes being melodramatic, but considering a consistent community element is the defining core aspect that makes vanilla work. Using game systems that could potentially cause people to not have a stable community is at very least playing with extremely dangerous fire.
---
Putting in shitloads of work to perfectly replicate spell batching and whatever else is cute and all, but the most important thing by far is that people integrate into a stable community. If the people you see and interact with is transient depending on what layer you're in, that is a big fucking problem.
---
It's vastly more important that you interact with and form meaningful relationships with those on your server than every spell be meticulously recreated.
---
Every thread has a different answer to where the inquisition are going.
---
thats fake news my friend, i had lvl 1 mage with 300 tailor an 300 enchanting
---
So they can have sharding without CRZ and they've had CRZ without this new "sharding" you speak of, yet somehow they're the same thing?
---
They didn't want people to vanish out of site when moving around like they do with sharing. I definitely get what you mean though...
---
Not trying to be an asshole, but until you figure out a different way to spread the server load evenly, sharding is here to stay.
---
This petition is about 2 months late buddy.
---
If both client computers and servers could handle IF lag back in vanilla (and the AH was literally wall to wall characters back then,) I don't see why the couldn't handle it now. Even retail feels so empty compared to the old days. Bad implementation of layering is something that is going to have serious negative effects.

Every guild on every server should work together to keep their servers free from this twitch cancer.

The fact that everyone seems ok with letting 10 dudes have the whole server to themselves seems ridiculous to me.

I'm in vancouver, Canada. My ping to US west is 44ms, my ping to US East is 60ms.

Hmm let me think.  Maybe have more servers? Just an idea.
---
I mean, they have a discord and realized people dont want to play with them already. ofc there will be streamers on every server, but the big ones all went in agreement not to play on certain servers.

I mean yeah it actually prolly was voted on by the streamers

https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/covjpf/why_you_want_to_avoid_streamer_servers/
---
one =/= several.  One server merge would affect the integrity of the community and the economy a hell of a lot less than layering from day one will.
---
Which is retarded. They should just open more realms
---
A beta is definitely not a demo, clearly you've never worked in software
---
5 million people lmaooooo.
---
BFA launch was seamless on my server, as was Legion.
---
I keep seeing a bunch of complaints about layer, but last I saw, Blizzard said it was only going to be enabled during the first month or so of Classic to reduce server stress. I would love to see the world full of people, but at the same time if it is actually only for a month or so like Blizzard said, that's not a bad deal, especially if it makes for a smooth launch experience.
---
Stay away from da voodoo!
---
Yeah doing their job for them like a drone m8. This doesn’t matter, still a huge negative impact on the game. From the community stuff, the accidental bs and the deliberate abuse that can all happen with layering... it’s not worth having it in the game, whatever reason they might have: dead servers, long Qs etc. I’ll take any of that and worse if I could have classic without layering, at launch.
---
Ya the first day will be a shit show. Let's hope blizzard announces more servers before name reservation
---
I like your idea so much and would love to see this implemented. However implementation wise it would probably be resolved most efficiently by using different shards for the capital cities. I can only imagine how people will react when they hear the word "shard".
---
reeeeeeeeeee
---
iT's JusT Th€ bEta. ReeLAx
---
I don't see your point you dont want even small 10 viewer streamers or something. Actually the most stuck up community lmfaoo.
---
ahh semantics, the argumentative tool of middle schools everywhere.
---
Imo you see this so fucking often. Dude A ganks Dude B and moves on with questing, Dude B comes back with a vengeance and settles the score, Dude A flips his fucking shit and decides all resources must now be spent on making B's life as miserable as possible for as long as possible. Some people just have 0 self awareness and are petty as shit.
---
The game hasn’t launched, you have zero idea how any of this layering tech will ultimately work outside of a test environment. And you’re just now realizing the game has a subscription, the same one it’s always had?
---
Do us all a favor and just walk away and wish whatever you want. Please. Just go.
---
It’s funny how the argument he is making is the same as ours with the idea of just merge servers if they drop low enough in pop. But just the complete reverse version with an extra game breaking step.
---
Already looking very fucked with the server count :/
---
Is 5k in one general chat any better?
---
Actually all the big name realms were down
---
EA-Blizzard
---
Mage is probably the most straight-forward/simple in dungeons and raids thanks to being ranged and easy spell rotation.
---
But honestly both classes fit what you're looking for.
---
Many pservers are hosted in non-EU nations or Russia itself. This won't change a thing. It will just make it more difficult for people that aren't tech savvy to access those hosts, but let's not kid ourselves -- only techy people are using pservers in the first place.
---
And no one suggest a VPN for this was ever free. Many pservers players have them already and all but a few servers (the strictly anti-Chinese ones) allow them.
---
Not sure if you're a troll or just too dumb to understand that the issues of layering extend far people 2 people sitting outside a city.
---
I don't understand why his fans would blindly farm hours for him so they can get 1 second of recognition on his stream.
---
I’m on a high pop server and it wasn’t down.
---
Thoughts on it being abused to opt out of pvp fights, farm spam rares and profession nodes?
---
I am planning on joining Shazzrah with friends, but if open world PVP makes me cry irl again, I will switch to Mirage Raceway.

You can't know what kind of bug this is without knowing how the code works, you're just being pessimistic
---
Where can I see this facts?
---
It's certainly not bugfree.  Someone got phased out while fighting troggs with his party.  [Ended up 1v2 against new fresh full hp troggs with his party no where to be found](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/coja9q/layering_seriously_needs_to_get_fixed_before/).  That was in this stress test.
---
But that's what these tests are for. Hopefully we'll have as few bugs as we can hope for.
---
My guild master has told us we are all going to Golemagg, the decision was made after a huge meeting from multiple Alliance and Horde Spanish guilds on Discord. Pyrewood Village will be the Spanish PvE realm though.

Empirically they are the same.

---
Imagine refreshing the new posts on r/classicwow midday on a weekend and criticizing how someone else chooses to spend their time.
---
Slightly annoyed is pretty mellow already but imo if you make a habit out of trying to kill people, getting killed once shouldn't phase you. If you're getting camped or otherway griefed, I get it, but a single kill imo shouldn't affect you in the slightest if you're regularly doing that to other people anyway.
---
27 hours till name reservation, I doubt it
---
Shit man, I was able to buy my way into BWL at one point.  
---
One of the best parts of Classic WoW was that what you didn’t in game, and how you accomplished things, was entirely up to the community.
---
Because the alternative is you still not having killed 10 lvl 1 boars bt the end of phase 1. 
---
There's 2 things we can count on, launch will be absolutely insane and would result in way too many players per zone with no layering.  And there will be far fewer players at the end of phase 1 than at launch.   Layering is the obvious solution.
---
this is what i live for, blizz pls take notice
---
Yep, Whitmane 1 through 5, no way to hop between them but they can still collapse them if pops go down. Have names still apply to the main server so theres no name loss when merging.
---
Like a year down the line I imagine this will be pretty rampant considering how piss easy it is to make money in BFA so it really wouldn't surprise me if people trade like 1k gold vanilla for like 500k gold BFA but then again A LOT of the players coming into classic aren't the slightest bit interested in BFA and only want classic so they market might be stupidly small but still do able I guess unless they outright say its a bannable offense.
---
Because he will receive a proper answer. There are also many groups who search in german on the stresstest. The groups are filled very fast ans everyone is german. Without language barriers you have much easier runs and a better communication. Even though i can understand you very well.

---
That's like saying a Civic and a Corvette are the exact same car.  Yeah, they're both cars, and they get you from a to b, but they do it in very different manners and have a lot of different qualities
---
Layering is not sharding, nor is it phasing. It's a continent wide partition of the realm server consisting of 3k players, the same size as a vanilla realm. Why do you think an image at the end of a stress test is an accurate representation of how live will be?  
---
What's the solution to the problem when a large large part of players start dropping off? MMORPG all suffer from this and classic will especially suffer from this when some people find out that they don't like the grind. And most MMO don't absolutely massive releases, vanilla wow started out small and grew naturally, meanwhile classic will probably have &gt; 1 million starting population and then it's gonna dip, how do you expect the needed 200 realms to not die out?  
---
Endlessly merge them over and over, each time bricking the economy and forcing guild and player name change because of name collisions?
---
No, you're really not understanding the implications of the new laws. It's not just the Private Server that will get blocked, but everything hosted by that company. Unless the Private Servers buy their own hardware and create their own international ISP, they're DOA.
---
having thousands of people fighting over the same mobs would not be fun, so layering is more of a design choice than a stability issue.  I would hope.
---
I'd rather wait for something good than play this abomination with people disappearing in front of my eyes, yes.
---
Or just open more than two fucking servers in EU, how about that solution for queues?
---
it's going to be an absolute circus!
---
but i'm not letting that stop me
---
Mostly it's done with professions and the mats are in the lower tier raids. Part of the "pregression"
---
Yes. 5 million is a MASSIVE over-estimation. Like, holy shit what?
---
I agree that layering is terrible and should be removed, but at least spell correctly next time.

---
you’re right af  but this sub is sympathetic to that same backwards political ideology so get ready for some downvotes
---
They just say it to stop people from dodging. No way they choose a ”lower” pop server when Shazz is on the table.
---
This is why I was in favor of their first solution.... Sharding in starting zones but nowhere else. They said in the beginning just the starter areas, but no cities or high level areas.
---
That would have been 10x better than people in Orgrimmar disappearing until phase 2 hits.... I'm still bitter that we didn't leave well enough alone.... Start zone sharding wouldn't have been that bad; especially since it would have ended Phase 2 also... Now we have entire world "Layering" and its like, sharding on steroids.
---
When you do a line of classic expecting it to be layering laced with classic but its actually a line of pure classic.
---
When League of Legends realm was was located in LA Cali my ping in Boston Massachusetts was 80-90.  Which really isn't bad.  You have to remember too that they left in melee leeway and spell batching which were aspects of the game designed to help out higher ping.
---
And we all had way worse internet in 2004 so I think you'll do fine.  But you don't HAVE to committ to it.  Just try it and see if the latency feels ok or not.
---
Not really.
---
You saying retail has the exact same problems? i mean phasing out randomly, thats doesn't seem right
---
Isn’t it possible they simply have the threshold for triggering a layer change set higher than normal for the stress tests? Just asking.
---
You were the retard first
---
Not really, no. But chaos was a part of launch 15 years ago. It's only right that it should be so again.
---
They're doing what they can dude, it's not going to be perfect and everyone should have known from the start. If you play it as is, you will still have a heap of fun. Private servers would be more vanilla-like on certain ways, but you can't beat official persistence. Win some, lose some; still have a blast.
---
Emerald Dream worked like, well, a dream
---
Okay that's fair enough then.
---
the effective dps from that crit aura is less than the dps of just another warrior, like I said at least on p servers thats the deal. We tested it in AQ and Naxx, same thing with moonkin aura.
---
World of Warcraft: Infinity Layer.
---
We should spam Blizz with buy tickets about it
---
Two weeks out isn't a lot if time to fix any issues which we've clearly seen are still present.
---
well i don't see how instant mail would destroy anything. Have worked like that on every private server I have played on and doesn't seem to have destroyed the enjoyment for anyone. But to each their own.
---
and all the white ppl are quitting the game cuz the servers dead.  all of servers r dead.
---
they also said classic wouldnt happen.  they reserve the right to backtrack on promises.  they do it all the time.
---
its not sharding nor is it running vanilla lol
---
Wonder where it's running to.
---
This.i ptefer pvp for pve but if the corpsecamping and ganking is too strong i will move to mirage highway

Whatever is fun

Keep layering in the starter zones only
---
Priest. Healing people is the same, no matter the encounter - PvP, dungeons, raids.

Their rotation can relatively simple to be effective, but has a huge ceiling to grow into with time and practice.

You'll be dominant in PvP and PvE as well.

Indeed, I agree.
---
I've always been a double bed and TV kinda guy, comfort is King Bros!
---
It's gonna be awful either way. E-celebs of all kinds, fortnite kids everywhere, people just sitting on their discords, people using lfg addons/third party lfg sites instead of actually socializing ingame like back then.
---
Spell pushback when hit is so bad on druids, it’s a waste to cast
---
"If you were gonna ask me a ball park number...I would say probably..around..the first couple months?" said while shrugging shoulders.
---
The fact that you read that as a rock solid promise of 2 months is actually pretty amazing.
---
Is this beta or stress test? 
---
Because stress test no one is in the main cities because they’re busy questing. 
---
They have no reason to be trading at AH or banking stuff. 
---
It’ll change. Fuck layering. A realm is a realm.
---
No one is giving streamers a server, they can play wherever they want and dont mind if you play with them. They are just trying to let people know which servers they will NOT be on for the people who want to avoid them. The only ones trying to claim servers are the anti-streamer people trying to say Herod for example belongs to them and streamers cant play there.
---
A server merge disrupts established economies, creates massive social recognition problems and grievances through forced name change, requires servers experience the pain of sufficient stretches of time depopulated to merit merging, and creates the public perception that an mmo is failing because it is unable to sustain population. 
---
Addressing tourism/launch surge via additional servers guarantees dead servers, isolates communities otherwise likely to play and remain together who could reach each other across layers, and will either overshoot even the launch conditions or require queues, turning potential customers away from the game from the beginning. Bad deal.
---
So tell me if I am wrong but I understand it that way:
---
When classic launches, the "realmlist" will get updated. So we basicly create a char on a new server right? If I create a new char on another stresstest server atm (-&gt; tested with the EU PvE server), the only setting that I had to do is "auto loot" and weapon swing timer. All my other addons + camera + quest text + social stuff was the same. So basicly if you played stresstest, this should not be nessesary or am I missing something?
---
On another note: I could probably wait with this (if nessesary) until I createt the character on Tuesday or does the game create the folders on "enter the world"?
---
I love it when you're just running on a road somewhere, and another faction member pops up infront of you heading the opposite way, and you both just buff each other without a word and go about your business lol.
---
&gt; Could be lying too, some people are desperate for Classic to fail.
---
Its not a lie, but its definitely a bug. It makes no sense when it happens. It doesnt drop your group or anything, you just get pushed off the layer, which logically makes zero sense...
---
Its clear its a bug, but its going to be frustrating asf until Phase 2 hits and that crap is gone.
---
Coming from a low pop server half of what I want is the mmo feeling. I want to bump into server mates often even if crowded, make friends on the way.That and walking about in sw/ org and recognising players by class looks and gear.
---
Yeah then get a TV :)
---
Hope you enjoy classic with your new setup!
---
The industry learned from that mistake though. Open too many servers and when the population dies off you have a bunch of empty servers and have to deal with painstaking server merges. Also, when given a lot of servers to choose from the majority of people will choose the most populated one...also defeating the purpose of having a lot of servers. We've seen this in many MMOs and in WoW we've had 2-4 huge servers for years: Illidan, Sargeras, Stormrage, and Area 52. Remove sharding and 90% of servers in WoW today would be ghost towns. The issue of layering only exists to mitigate the launch wave. Blizz really only had two options, mitigate the launch with modern tech (layering), or allow the launch to create long lasting issues.
---
Oh shit didn't know it was that close
---
[Streamers who blacklist](https://www.twitch.tv/sodapoppin/clip/HyperWrongLatteWoofer)
---
Is it possible that they have the threshold for triggering a layer change set higher than normal for the stress tests?
---
Nah underpopulated servers suck.  Progression is harder. Less people to group with. Less bgs.  Everything goes way slower with much longer lfg times. Less people to help out in a zone
---
&gt; Layering also will not happen after Phase 1
---
You don't know that, Blizzard didn't say that. Even if that's the case, phase one will last a couple of months.
---
&gt; most people are going to quit directly because of layering. Why not just scrap it entirely?
---
u r not important
---
Any american that has an issue with hearing/seeing other languages is a bad american.
---
Because most people on this sub said that layering is necessary and the problems will be fixed i.e. "Its a beta, report the bug instead of complaining, it will get fixed before launch". And even 2 weeks before launch many people on this sub legimately think that we should not complain and just report the bug and move on. It boggles my mind.
---
I didn't say it was a rock solid promise. That's what ~ is for and also the word "estimated". Get over yourself kid.
---
Never heard of it
---
I think it makes more sense at this point to organize a large scale boycott of the game. Blizzard is like any other company, the first and only thing that matters to them is profit. Period. If they can release a broken game and make a profit, the game will remain broken. If they see a large amount of people refusing to give them money because of bugs, you would be fucking shocked at how quickly the fix these things. It would be almost instant. 
---
I won't be playing until sharding is fixed/removed.
---
90% of most guilds won't be raiding in phase 1. Note that "2005" (most of it) will be when we're scheduled to be out of phase 1.
---
The ones that do will have solutions for this problem.
---
When you find out you have imaginary friends
---
that ship has sailed
---
It wont be playable for as long as layering is a thing and until they add more servers.
---
the shield is just one item. Plate items tend to have almost double the amount of armor that a mail item does. Shamans cannot wear plate. Warriors wear almost full if not full plate during pvp. Shamans will never have more armor than a pvp geared warrior
---
Are you at work or home?
---
Show us where you read it will only be  for 1 month.
---
Snakes
---
If 15$ a month is something you have to worry about, you probably shouldn’t be spending your time playing an mmo and worry about your education or career.
---
That would be even easier though for exploitation.
---
Bruh, streamers dont really impact ur game. Yes mb ull see a crowd, but its super avoidable, stop this cringe shit and just be excited like a normal person 
---
Streamers keep the game alive with a very big inflow of money to developers, so yeah, mb theyre stupid like asmongold, but the dudes a nerd with a following nothing else. Like the rest of us, minus the following.
---
Hey that's not so bad. Does that mean I can retire and just play WoW all day now?
---
You're just shooting yourself in the foot.
---
Pretty sure there are guilds being built just to snipe streamers on this server. Idk if that was being done before now lol. Literal bounty hunters
---
People have been complaining about it since DAY 1 of the beta. Are you actually joking? That's why people are so pissed, because it's actually *gotten worse* since the beta and people complaining about it.
---
Telling someone who hating sharding/layering/phasing to go play retail?
---
It will be more than one if you want decent pop based on blizzard estimates of tourist %.
---
I recommend Warrior, or Shaman, or Paladin, or Priest, or Druid, or Rogue, or Mage, or Warlock, or Hunter.
---
Go to bed esfand.
---
I am sure there will be issues there always the large streamer servers i expect will have issues but overall i doubt it will be that bad particularly for the pve and rp servers. I suspect Blizzard will closely monitor the number of accounts creating characters between now and launch and if they believe new servers are needed they will quickly bring them online. You are highly over estimating the amount of people in my opinion 1 million possible 5 million i seriously doubt it but hope i am wrong. If we get 5 million believe me Blizzard will be heading in a whole new direction and create a burning crusade team immediately.
---
I've got a 1080ti so should manage 4k, but obviously not at high framerates. For video/photo editing though obv that doesn't matter.
---
I don't play FPS games anymore so perhaps I should just bite that bullet.
---
The whole game should be. It's time to say fuck layering and everyone defending it.
---
Is it possible all these examples of buggy layering are just the result of blizzard actively changing the number of layers on the stress test and re-distributing the population at that exact moment?  Something that maybe wouldn't happen at launch?  Maybe there's still hope.  If not though, fuck everything about this.
---
With maybe a million people that want to play classic at launch, how many servers do you think Blizzard is going to make, or should we accept queues of many hours? And what do you want Blizzard to do when 90% of those servers have died down with the hype? People have had this same discussion 1000's of times on this sub already.
---
Try 4k, it makes a diff :D
---
Did you recently join the group and the person was on that layer?
---
Blizzard has implemented layer switching as "changing areas", so if you'd just joined the group you wouldn't have immediately switched layers to the group leaders.  You have to wait until you hit an area boundary (where names pop up).
---
I discovered this with two characters of my own.  Ran them both the same location, then joined up in group because they were on different layers.  Waited.  Waited. It wasn't until I ran into the tunnel out of Coldridge Valley that the layer switching happened.

Link in polish ofc, 2nd post contains relevant info
---
The best feeling though is a 4 STRENGTH 4 STAM LEATHER BELT
---
Casual would probably go to Mage. Both are great in PVP, but Mages don't require as much focus.
---
See, and that’s what happens if people jump to conclusions. I don’t do m+ with guildies, tbh I don’t do anything besides raiding with guildies, because I have a lot of friends from different servers with whom I’m doing m+ since legion, so, again: no. You don’t need much Time or commitment to go raiding even on relatively high levels
---
Oh good, another post giving an unasked for opinion, how helpful
---
well i agree its probably not happening, but i don't think time is the issue here. if people would actually be loud about this and show blizzard that this shit is really non negotiable they would bend to the pressure. just as they did with eu servers. sadly mods keep suppressing a lot of it and the shills are working extra shifts.
---
if launch day isn't a shitshow i will be disappointed tbh
---
This idea is underrated
---
Lol that’s funny to picture 
---
Yeah I thought so, people are really quick to blame it at layering when it’s a different issue
---
What are those suggestions?
---
well this is irrelevant because gold sellers were there by design, server owners payed for servers by letting them exist
---
Does anyone know where to find a good unitframes addon. All i found that worked with classic is xperl and I do not like xperl. Looking for something like luna or shadowed
---
My group was in Deadmines for 3 hours last night. We got stuck on Mr. Smite and on our third run back all the mobs had respawned, so we decided to call it quits. I think we could've killed both Mr. Smite and Cookie, but would've ran into the same issue as your group did with Edwin.
---
2 - Warriors (Tank, DPS) 1 - Druid (Heals) 1 - Paldadin (Heals) 1 - Warlock (DPS)
---
I've been surfing this sub for a couple days and a lot of people just seem like they want to be angry.
---
Cool. So you acknowledge that it could be "around 2 months", meaning 4-6 months is just as feasible.  Good to see an old coot still able to change his mind.
---
As a Scandinavian, glad to hear my brother!  
---
See you on the server!
---
How cancerous are bulgarians o  a scale of 1-10? Russian kid on csgo eith bad mic -bad?
---
Good luck finding out what layer they are on.  You could go through the entire life of the server and not cross paths with other people.  I'm OK with large servers but 100k mega servers split between layers makes it impossible to build a community.  You're getting layered while in group right now.
---
Do you know what's immersion breaking?  The remaining population of another server suddenly appearing in your "community", fully geared, and pissed off because they had to pick new names after merging two ghost towns.
---
"WTF where did this &lt;other faction&gt; fully decked out guild come from?"
---
&gt; HOWEVER: Servers still have a fixed capacity, adding layers does NOTHING to improve server capacity
---
Speculation at best.  There is no proof that modern hardware can't handle a hundred thousand people or more on it.  People just like to make this "fixed capacity" argument like they know some insider secret that proves their argument.
---
ive never made a WoW video but im so hyped for classic that i wanted to show this off because it's really worrying that we're this close to launch with issues like this
---
sorry , no script just everything off top of my head while drinking water. my bad.
---
Layering has problems but it will not 100% kill any sort of community building exaggeration does not help anything.
---
That's always a safe combination, depends on your end goals though. 
---
* Just something to have while leveling? 
---
* Plan on making money with it?
---
I think that would be a good idea! Is it still confirmed that layering will be dropped all together further into Classic? Seems like I've heard different stories on that.
---
Barbara Streisand
---
&gt; You could go through the entire life of the server and not cross paths with other people.
---
No, you couldn't.
---
Time is absolutely an issue. Not to mention that a large number of the arguments against layering are based on misinformation anyway.
---
Are you going to raid? Due to limited debuff slots on bosses warlocks are reduced to spamming shadow bolt. It's not super fun.
---
It does, but autopilot is strong, sometimes I understand what I’ve done only after I’ve done it. And if you don’t know about tricks like this, and are in a zone where enemy presence is basically nonexistant, it’s an even higher chance of that.
---
you can run a server in russia still and use vpns if your ISP blocks them
---
Skål my horde lock brøther. Lived 6 months in Norge and got viking ancestors. Might aswell join you!
---
I assume these anti guilds will be Horde, but I'll be going Alliance because irl friends want to play Paladins. I really hope theres a strong non-streamer community on Alliance as well.
---
That's most definitely a bug.  
---
It sounds like the same problem I've had with sharding when dual-boxing, where one character gets "stuck" in a different shard, even though they're grouped.  I can see the other toon, but I can't see the things attacking it.
---
Ironman that wand (I mean make it yourself)
---
That just eases the pain a little but paying the money still hurts while some classes just don’t have similar expenses. Sucks especially as somebody who wants to play more casually and still enjoy everything.
---
I'm hoping at least some of the problems we've seen reported are due some technical things like this rather than problems that will exist in the live game.
---
But so far that's just wishful thinking and Blizzard is kinda quiet on the situation so. *shrug*
---
For real, Esfand and Venruki are the only streamers that don't make me want to die
---
1-2 days after release they will be making new servers. They just want to make sure spreadsheets kids, speed runners and streamers are all on the same place so casuals and new player have a good time. 
---
"after the incredible popularity of Classic we have decided to make new servers" 29 of August
---
Ayy, me and my buddies dueled Xorlove in front of OG. I'm the warrior that almost won.
---
Obviously 5 million is too many but you’re assuming only Americans play WoW lol..it’s a global launch
---
Maybe they will?  You know that nothing is set in stone right?
---
&gt; Sure as fuckballs vanishing out of your current world breaks immersion, and when avoidable it should be avoided. Like wut bruh?
---
People vanish all the time.  There is literally a skill called 'vanish'.  How is your immersion broken by someone disappearing?  There are potions that let you vanish from sight.  An entire race can vanish from sight at will.  A BG queue can pop for me, which YOU have no way of knowing what happened, and I'll just vanish.  The game has **always** had people vanishing.  You know, because they log out sometimes...
---
There is probably no way to do it with the default WorldMapFrame as the zones are probably hardcoded as X/Y and they don't scale.  This is probably a bug from blizzard that needs to be fixed to allow for this.
---
You have three name reserves. Take your main name on three servers and go to one of the three they don’t join
---
I did that a lot on Priest until 40 when healing costs an extra 400 mana because I need to recast Shadowform every time. Also PW:F costs 50% of your mana along with using spells instead of wand after 40. Sry bois
---
What is the dps. Difference between troll/orc/tauren hunter?  Do pet damage and blood fury beat out now spec and berserking? Especially if you use a gun?
---
This is actually the exact code (plus 1 more line for fading on movement) code that SimpleMap uses and it doesn't work correctly.
---
Dota 2 exists btw.
---
The negative perception would exist and be justified. Humans aren't machines who require their opinions to be completely correct to hold them. Case in point: This controversy. 
---
If the servers are pre connected, all you've done is sub divide the population into, what's this, layers! based on server group, but with static buckets instead of dynamic buckets. There will still be queues because people are not as efficient or rational at load balancing as good code. There will still be full and dead servers, by chance alone. Especially when people congregate because of attractive, active communities. 
---
Not bothering with your video. I've answered your questions, you fail to acknowledge there is a very real tradeoff. You may disagree with Blizzard's decision, but there are good reasons. 
---
Have a nice day. Try not to cry over layering too much.
---
You message them. You get their Discord information. You either operate in the bounds of the game and create the community you want or you don't play the game.
---
I don't think they'll remove it, they've clearly been full of shit enough to this point that I see no reason to believe them. If enough people pay them and they make a profit, the game will stay the way it is
---
If it stays like this they can stick my subscription money up their ass. Ruins the whole experience. All i wanted was a normal classic experience. Well, there are other games that are fun tho.

---
They cannot. Major cities are not their own instance, you don't get a loading screen when you enter Thunder Bluff or any other city or zone in the world. Ogrimmar is in the same instance as Silithus, Moonglade, Feralas, Valley of Trials.
---
The whole Kalimdor is a one layer. Some goes for the Eastern Kingdom.
---
&gt; Look, I'm not Australian, but that doesn't mean that the derogatory value of a word is stripped away simply because in one place people don't use it that way. It's not relative. And I would hazard a guess that there are some Australians that don't see the word in that light
---
I can sum up your whole post with "I don't have a clue, but my gut feeling must be right".
---
Its true. We got classic largly due to a select few could get people together and riled up and demand classic. Streamers were the most significant and influencial in this endeavour. Stop hating them and accept it. I personally some streamers are pretty dumb and really cant understand why they have a following. But there are good ones too. Just avoid them. Walk a circle around them. Chinese miners were shit too, but they at one point were like 40% of world of warcrafts revenue, nd guess what, money matters. Not as in blizz doesnt have enough to run wow as a non profit. But they are a business, nd if theres less money flowing in from said source, less love, developement, bugfixing, ticketresolving wow will get. So fkimg grow up u dm ass downvoters and accept streamers.
---
I believe the power levels are now over 9000!
---
this is a uneducated opinion
---
i THINK, they are tuning whatever decides who goes on what layer.  They are not leaving the test up over the weekend out of the kindness of their hearts.  The server guys would probably like to keep them up longer but they don't want to weaken the release.
---
“Continent wide layers” were a lie. GG.
---
Omg you poor soul!
---
Yes that's what I'm going to do. The only thing you can do with a company is vote with your wallet. I will sub for classic when sharding is fixed or removed.
---
Ayyyy you figured it out, too.
---
Most game subs devolve into that. Every game has that loud minority that slowly drives away everyone else until they are the majority of a sub
---
You could always just not play instead of coming here and pissing on people's enthusiasm.
---
Pretty sure the people that are against layering are a dedicated minority. Blizzard wants to attract the most people possible at launch, and they want these people to stick around. Queues of hours upon hours won't help them out much, and creating 100s of servers and letting them die out within a few months, then forcing Blizz to merge them isn't a healthy alternative either.
---
In Vanilla/Classic people are out in the world doing things. Not sitting in town. Its a new concept I know but thats how it will be.
---
BRB, I'm gonna handle my wand.
---
I've had a keyboard with a mic/headphone jack before, and the keyboard itself was USB, so that could definitely be an attainable goal, but that was a while ago so I don't even remember what make the keyboard was unfortunately. That whole setup sounds extremely comfy though, I hope you get it up and running as envisioned.
---
No, you don't understand.
---
I'm a business owner in Russia that does business with EU member states, my online store is managed by a large Russian hosting provider which also happens to have customers that have copyright infringing material available.
---
Blizzard sends a notice to the EU of this copyright infringement, the EU sends a notice to the Russian hosting provider that unless they comply, their entire platform will be inaccessible from within the EU.
---
That Russian hosting provider immediately shuts down the infringing customer's content because if they don't, my unrelated business and everyone else's suffers, meaning we all have to switch hosting providers.
---
Thanks a lot for the efforts, I have a big horde guild on Ragnaros(US) and we are all moving to Faerlina, I shared this link so we can all start helping the statistics. 
---
Blizzard didn't create LATAM servers, so we are going to get together ourselves and claim one server for us, seems faerlina will be it.
---
Stratholme, DM, Scholomance, UBRS are all designed for 60. You can enter them at lower level but even quests are for level 60. And generally, you wont find many 50-59lvl people there if any
---
I get what OP is saying but I think the griefers
---
will be few - besides all servers will have griefers one way or another, its not an isolated RPPVP issue but rather an overarching problem in gaming. 
---
I will roll horde and I can assure you all alliance are kill on sight, and to establish further faction dominance over a zone I will probably camp my mortal enemies until they cry and leave the zone for the glory of the Horde.
---
I found a working one called 'Details!' on willitclassic.com
---
If you're having any issues with questie, check out their discord and they'll help you out.  But downloading the latest from github or curseforge should be working now and fixed a lot of issues that seemed to have popped up between the beta and the stress test (blizzard seemed to have changed some APIs without anyone knowing so a lot of addons broke)
---
It's a stress test beta, in all likelihood there really is nothing better to do.  Would you rather fuck around with a popular streamer or level a bit when your progress is going to be wiped in a few days anyway?
---
It's not instant
---
rar
---
It's not about hardware. Classic world is very crowded with 10k+ players. It's a design problem. While its perfectly fine to shard away players in retail, this would destroy classic Long term
---
Will you people stop complaining for every minor setback that happens in a BETA GAME, just. stop. for. once.
---
Something awful? They still exist?
---
It does appear that zones are instanced now. I'm a hunter on the stress test, and I was searching zones with Eagle Eye for herbalism nodes. On the edge of The Barrens, before entering Stonetalon Mountains, I used eagle eye to explore the zone. No herbs appeared, and no NPCs were visible. As soon as I entered stonetalon, and the map name changed, I tried again. Lots of nodes and NPCs were then visible. Not sure if this is different from vanilla, but that video definitely looks like you tried to enter the "instance" of Elwynn Forest, lagged, couldn't enter, then were ported back to the beginning of the "instance", the mid bridge.
---
I never encountered a problem. Does that cancel yours out?
---
Once upon a time I was playing Vanilla.  It was in Hillsbrad Foothills.  I was doing some quest involving bears.  Soon there were no more bears.  Soon there were no more people.  WTF?
---
WORLD SERVER DOWN
---
Guess what kids?  "NPC-less" zones happened in Vanilla.  It didn't ruin the game.  We got over it and logged back in.
---
Because vanish, potions etc. Are from the game?
---
Layering is a server utility, which has fuck all to do with immersion mate. 
---
Ugh like what even? U get my point?
---
Events like these is why I love Classic so much. Our hunters managed to kite the Elite to the Throne Room, as the other City Guards didn't want to help us. In the end, all the mob dropped was a Pointy Crocolisc Tooth, but we still all rolled for it as if it was epic loot. Thanks for the good memory!
---
Would rather get fucked over a few times than deal with unplayable questing on day one. Assuming they remove it when the playerbase inevitably dies I don't see why people are complaining.
---
I'm between Shadow Priest (a role I'll have to work for) Moonkin (another role I'll have to work for that even less people understand) and Warlock (easiest to get into raids)
---
Shadow Priest This is the only class I've actually raided as, albeit in Wotlk. Shadowform's probably the coolest form in the game, their rotation is actually interesting and not just Shadowbolt/Frostbolt spam, and it takes more effort to raid with as you need to become a guild's one and only shadow priest, not to mention how many manapots and consumes you'll need to farm. They're also amazing in PVP if played right, and if I had to heal, Priest is the most fun healing class in the game with more than 3 or 4 healing spells they ever use. I like their class fantasy, which is important as I'm rolling on Grobbulus, an RP-PVP realm, and Priest gets Benediction/Anathema, probably the coolest epic in the game. Oh and Priest is really simple to level for me and I'm pretty comfortable with it.
---
Warlock This is the only non hybrid class that interests me at all. They get their free level 40 mount, have cool abilities like creating health and soulstones, and get the best looking sets next to Druids. They're really fast to level and have insane survivability as well. I will say I'm not too huge on pet classes in general, but Warlock pets are better than Hunter pets in vanilla insofar as you don't need to micromanage them as much, but it can still feel like a ball and chain sometimes. Warlock raiding may have multiple viable specs you can run as, but it seems to all devolve into Shadowbolt spam regardless, despite their big dps. Warlock class fantasy as alright to me, but it's not as cool as Shadow Priest, Warlock's are just Mages with no moral compass that use whatever power they can find to get stronger, vs Shadow Priests which are obscure cultists that were driven insane by the void/old gods and have no clear cut motives. Warlocks can also summon people to raids and are just the ultimate wing man class, which is a plus for me.
---
Moonkins By far the most controversial spec next to Ret Pallies and Ele Shaman, they're basically celestial Mages that draw their power from the moon, stars, and sun, which is pretty cool class fantasy as far as I'm aware. Being Druids they get travel and aquatic forms for fast leveling, although I hate how they pretty much have too level as Feral and nothing else, I just really don't like how melee dps works in WoW in general. I guess I might be able to offset this and level as Balance anyways in a group and being able to benefit from mana totems. This is another class that takes skill to raid with as while most guilds know having a single shadow priest is important, almost everyone thinks Moonkins are a complete joke, which is a shame considering they're capable of mid-range dps and give a really nice spell crit buff for their party, they also take around the same amount of consume and manapot farming as shadow priests. Druid healing seems pretty lacklustre if I'm forced into that, but at least they're the only class capable of combat res outside of a Warlock's soulstones which has to be applied pre-emptively. Druids also get some cool looking sets on top of the Moonkin's cool class fantasy, not to mention Resto Druids will eventually be able to turn into fricking Trees in TBC which is one of the best things ever. For anyone that's going to automatically shit all over Moonkin, I'd recommend looking at these videos. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWNykuTfSU0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq-sQnOVANw

No, you didn’t “just state your opinion”. You decided to be a snarky fuckhole for no reason, you don’t get to complain about maturity when you’ve been talking to people the way you have. 
---
If you think it should be permanent, then whatever, but make your case without being combative and childish. 
---
So stop with the bullshit “ok?” Comments when you’re given exactly what you asked for
---
Look at it this way. Server merges means months of absolutely no opportunity to interact with anyone from the other to-be-merged servers. 
---
Layering is session-based. You not seeing someone is no different than if you two just happened to play at different times of the day. Not to mention a lot of bonding comes from elite quests / dungeons, of which you're advertising in general/trade/whatever which are shared channels between layers. 
---
In the vast majority of cases, the only negative of layering is not SEEING some people that you were unlikely to interact with anyway.
---
But how do you make that distinction? I mean if a streamer is sitting stealthed in a bush and someone goes right to them, then yeah, it's pretty obvious. Other than that though, who's to say who's sniping? Everyone is going to know where the streamers are. Hell, there were players of the other faction on my relatively small server back in the day who's location would get called out in trade.

&gt; quest reward limited use items are almost gamebreaking

*Random shit that gives +10% crit you find at level 28*
---
Gotta keep that for Naxx !
---
that’s what i buff them with. might not help but i think they appreciate it a little besides it is “the thought that counts” right?
---
&gt;the 2-5% who RPed did that in secluded areas.
---
Are you seriously not seeing that they do it in secluded areas because of people who think ganking people who enjoy roleplay makes them cooler?
---
&gt;Naming policy is not gonna be enforced in a million years, unless some  salty elitist RPer reports ur ass for "lore inappropriate name" 
---
I ended up with a perm ban in vanilla for naming a character on an RP realm Tomjones, because it was my third strike. This happened even if you are ignorant of it.
---
&gt; RP event in the wild? RED IS DED, dont wanna be ganked in a\* contested  zone\*, go to a non-contested zone. If thats not good enough, ill say im  RPing as a "silent hunter" 
---
"Silent hunter" rp isn't good enough either, what else you got?
---
Then leave, bye.
---
Someone disagrees with my opinion? Better insult them! That will make me more right.
---
I'd think it's easier to add servers later and offer free character transfers than to have too many realms that end up dead.
---
Can’t express enough how great bandages are in Classic. They help you move along so well
---
Wow, NA PVP server population is 56% horde and 44% alliance. That's a huge gap. 
---
Many of the people who say they want to focus on pvp are going horde, so there will be less world pvp for them and slower queue times.  I really wish it was closer to even, this is ridiculous. It might turn out the alliance will be the home of the true pvp players. They have an easier time raiding as well, so it might be a well geared alliance side with instant pops sweeping aside horde that had significantly longer to wait.
---
If you consider yourself a hardcore pvp player and thought horde was the choice, you might need to reconsider.
---
And Shaman looks like its the second most populated class on Horde. Good luck gearing your already hard to gear ele ele off spec while healing in raids.
---
Get good at cycling mobs you don’t need so when grouping with a rando you can ensure you get all the quest mobs
---
No, around 2 months does not make 4 or 6 months "just as feasible".
---
why tho lol
---
so youll watch their streams and die to their viewers? we get it man
---
Do you know how ? Is there an attack closest macro?
---
The streamers already confirmed they're NOT rolling on Thalnos.
---
"Asperger syndrome is an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) considered to be on the “high functioning” end of the spectrum. Affected children and adults have difficulty with social interactions and exhibit a restricted range of interests and/or repetitive behaviors."

sperg is a shortform of aspergers.
---
People like you are the reason retail is shit.
---
Currently layering shouldn't work like that. It should keep a few layers active across the whole *continent* so you'd be stuck with a couple thousand other people on the same continent regardless. It shouldn't phase per zone per character. I think they've purposefully turned it up for this final test to see how the system will handle the traffic and how the community will react.
---
Hopefully they're looking at all this and taking notes. It's currently way too aggressive and just like in retail.
---
The streamers already confirmed they're NOT rolling on Thalnos. Keep up buddy.
---
It’s literally the equivalent of calling someone a dick but for some reason vaginas are scary in America.
---
“Blizzard will never remove layering.”
---
“Layering will kill the economy.”
---
“People are going to be swapping layers nonstop and I’ll never see any of these players again.”
---
Oh, and my favorite one:
---
“Classic is already dead because of layering.” This one is great because these are the same people saying 10 million players will be on at launch. That’s a hell of a dead game.
---
r/classicwow doesn't own the server kid
---
But how? A server can only handle so many connections? Layering doesn't make connect 'more efficient'
---
Yeah your opinion is unpopular for a reason dipshit.
---
A fully geared out guild popping up out of nowhere doesn't break immersion? Or a massive influx of players disgruntled because they had to change their names that they had reserved since before launch?
---
I find it interesting that any streamer will have enough power to blacklist a person on the entire server.  There are going to be thousands of players and tons of guilds that simply don't give a shit, or even prefer to have people who will hunt down streamers.
---
My IQ isn't low enough to know what "poggers" means. Dare I ask?
---
u stop whining?
---
There won't be dead servers because the servers will literally be merged when that starts to happen, which is the entire point of planned merging.
---
So the economy gets messed up if you merge servers. And you need to take time into making more servers. That's literally all you have against merging servers, and what you use to justify the buggy, shit storm that is layering
---
welcome to 2019, if you dont like it dont play on that server. you wont stop it and this whole meme of hating streamers just gives them more attention with the drama
---
This isn't just lag, read the chat.  
---
Transfer aborted: Instance not found.  
---
It tried to push him to another layer which was down, and warped him back to the phasing border. Phasing, sharding, layering, it's the same issue when one of the coalesced hosts doesn't hand over.
---
Possibly, Horde and going PvP realm if you guys are also.
---
I laughed out loud at the reality of this post. 
---
I'm absolutely down. 
---
I'm going to be more casual but I'd prefer a PVP server as well. 
---
Ideally EST, but I'd rather avoid streamers than nit pick EST and PST. 
---
During the stress tests it seems like the RP-PVP folks are pretty friendly. Super nice change of pace.
---
Exploration leveling was only a thing on private servers. Exploration exp in Vanilla/Classic gives you about 1-2 mobs worth of exp.
---
Wait until launch, it will hardly be empty then. The people that have been doing the math believe we have more players per layer than there was players per server is both vanilla servers and in private servers.
---
The highest boss in a dungeon is level 61. Making it somewhat difficult for level 58 (3 levels) . It's been explained by developers for years that dungeons were there bridge the gap from level from 50 to 60. I'm sorry if you expected a challenge.
---
HAVE RAPES DECIDED WHAT SERVER THEY ARE GONNA PICK?
---
Is there a way to make a macro or something that makes it so in stealth you weapon swap your dagger to your main hand, but while out of stealth you swap your sword back to your mainhand? I seem to remember being able to do this in vanilla
---
This has nothing to back it up, but i can see Mankirk having a higher Horde population while Pagle will be the home for Alliance,
---
I agree with you. And that's likely what's going to happen.
---
Fuck layering and fuck that Naga cave too
---
Im sure the faction ones were linked as soon as they were implemented, although i don't think the goblin ones in booty bay and Gadgetzan were initially linked to Everlook
---
I expect TONS of bugs on the add-ons that the authors will be fixing. It isn't just blizz changes that will cause new versions
---
And blizz's perspective on SS is just "stop broadcasting your location", so who cares if you're sniping or not.  Hell, even your toadies are technically stream sniping to find you.
---
Thatd be fucked up if soda/asmon rerolled a new server a few months in. Have some respect for the thousands that just want to enjoy the game
---
I'm sure it was a joke tbh, but I thought it was funny.

If you're considering something named "beta" to be a "demo" then you've really just done this to yourself. They're not the same thing. Some companies in the gaming industry might be blurring the line, but that doesn't mean that Blizzard's beta is demoable softwre. Also not sure why you're calling me sweetie. That's kinda weird.
---
What I'd like to know is how this guy knows Faerlina is 1/50 Spanish. I see posts talking about Spanish rolling on Faerlina all day, but it's all just rumors and hearsay unlike BR and Thalnos which is confirmed
---
I love giving people a healthstone as a present, and then asking them to group up.  
---
It helps adjust the mindset of some players who are super selfish oriented towards quests and mob spawns and they usually started grouping with me.
---
I might just go back to private server if it turn out they are indeed superior product.
---
I want her to step on me now 8))))))))
---
&gt;On all kinds of PvP servers, if there is a PvP solution to a problem (call high level people to fend off the camper) then there is no GM action to be taken.
---
This is inconsistent with the rules Blizzard has held for years. To combat safespotters you can just l2p and get to the spot yourself, but this is not okay. Scrub shitheads in WSG who can't wallclimb cry rivers if an enemy FC does it and they can't do it too, yet another l2p issue which Blizzard did not accept as being l2p.
---
Lagging out, logging out etc. Are all just functions not part of the game which are unavoidable. They do break immersion and should be avoided if possible, which isnt the case for either of them
---
 Neither for the whole layering issue sinc as you smartly put, its the best solution to the whole dilemma (considering the naming issue)
---
Yeah it took a ton of tries and some luck with not missing/getting crit
---
Server merging was super common back in the day. I appreciate your thought out reply, but I do think queues of over 2000+ populated servers should be a thing and is expected. They should just have more servers, even populations of 1000+ are still plenty. Also people really forget that the size of the map and spread of players, will be so much more dense in classic. There are not 6 expansion areas for players. 
---
Honestly though, my solution? Have layering servers and layering free servers. Let us wait, queue and lag if we want.
---
I mean there’s not a snowballs chance in hell of that happening, but I’m glad you’re arguing in good faith
---
You thought I was talking about the intellect racial, but I was talking about escape artist. I should've specified. Either way it absolutely makes a difference. Having an extra ability that allows you to remove movement impairing effects is pretty big in PVP. OP stated he wants to PVP, so it's definitely something he should take into consideration. But as I stated in my first post: if he doesn't want to stare at a gnome, he shouldn't roll gnome.
---
Sorry för det
---
Yes, the poor man’s vanilla.
---
I know you're only using that word as an example and not to cause offense, but next time could you please censor the m-word? 
---
When are they allowed to complain? Once it's released?
---
thats literally your opinion lol
---
I'd like to but I will have a busy schedule so I don't know yet !
---
You cant work around stun resists.
---
Stoneform its good all around for pvp. It has some value for a tank and in pve you're going to have a free dispel for a lot of fights. 
---
Now thinking dwarf itself. Undoubtedly the best alliance race for priests due to fear ward and I can't remember but I think priests can not dispel poison themself so it has value there as well.
---
This shit guy dont fear about retaliation in real life? He thinks is owner if the world ,dam spoiled kid....
---
Tourists will only play for a month anyway. They probably make more money for Blizzard overall but they're a short term goal. Core players are always extremely important in keeping good PR for their games and for ensuring people buy stuff in the future.
---
I think is great for the brazilian community to organize yourselves and pick a realm (since blizzard didn't account for the 5th most populated country on the planet, which btw loves WoW).
---
Shaman looks like its the second most populated class on Horde. Good luck gearing your already hard to gear ele off spec while healing in raids. Waiting for the mages and warlocks to pass only to have to now roll against seven other shamans with the exact same idea will be very common.
---
I'd love a pinned thread on this subreddit reminding which servers streamers plan to be on so I can avoid that.
---
Richturpin should tell the streamers where he is rolling so they can avoid him, (horde streamers)
---
I'm looking for an addon like Bartender to reorganize the bars and set up keybinds easier. Couldn't find an addon that worked for classic though, could some help me out?

&gt;after a huge meeting from multiple Alliance and Horde Spanish guilds on Discord
---
I imagined it like pirate captains meeting in the caribbean :)
---
I felt unkillable on my warrior with my 3 stam buf from fort.
---
No. All hosting infrastructure is virtually sharded and completely scalable. A single realm with Layering could feasibly host an infinite number of players unless Blizzard puts an artificial limit on it.
---
Dude you're living in a pipe dream if you think this is enforceable. A fucking pipe dream. NO ONE can blacklist a whole provider, for the same reason that "threatening to" looks intimidating -- It's a suicide switch.
---
First time it happens, a bluff will be called... and if the EU tries it anyway then the EU will lose half its entire internet.

I stand corrected. It goes from 3 second cast to 1 second cast with talents.  
---
Still a hell of a lot better than 2% dodge.
---
yes!
---
Anything is possible but these are the exact same issues that are in retail - it's the same tech.
---
Blacklisted from what?  I think you overestimate their 'server power'.
---
I like him, a bit full of himself tho.
---
I believe this onebag worked for me while other websites versions did not https://legacy-wow.com/classic-addons/onebag3-classic/
---
Ofc he was being satirical. It was a joke, and good a quick lol, but still not rolling on a streamer server with him lol
---
All I ask for is civility. Also, I’m really glad that layering will be on the game because of it wasn’t this sub would be dead.
---
I'm going with a Troll Priest! Going to go Discipline for Power Infusion and buff other casters in Battlegrounds for fun.
---
 Good to know, thanks for the info. Roughly how many players are we talking about by the way?
---
The continents are servers in a technical sense. Even in Vanilla Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms were two distinct machines.
---
Scandis, Brits and Dutch people go well together in my experience. Let’s hope the Dutch join US aswell.
---
You don't have to walk there.  There are battlemasters in Classic.
---
[**Patch 1.6.0**](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.6.0)
---
Battlemasters
---
There is a new way to enter the battleground queues. Battlemasters! Located in each of the cities, right-clicking on a battlemaster will allow your character to enter a battleground queue just like you normally would if you touched that battleground's entrance portal. The functionality is exactly the same, so when it's your character's time to enter the chosen battleground, you will be teleported directly in. Local guards can give you directions on how to find the battlemaster that you're looking for.
---
LOLOLOLOLLOLOLOOLOLOLL
---
Rogue fits high ceiling 
---
Go engineer
---
The lore is mostly in the dungeons quests. Don't skip any them if you want to get into the story. They are long chain quest that you get in the 3 main cities.
---
Still more thinking that current tho : /
---
Ok but still intended to be temporary. I mean they dont do it just for the ‘lulz’ - clearly they think that the game would be worse off without it than with it.
---
This whole thread is a fucking joke.  Layering is just for the first few weeks, so that people can level up without a massive overcrowding in starter zones.  People would give up and stop playing if it were impossible to play at start.  After a few weeks layering is gone and the cities will be full.
---
You'll be just fine.
---
Gnomes might have a tiny miniscule damage increase over you but at least you can see your armor and don't look ridiculously small.
---
Diplomacy is nice for grinding reputation rewards. Perception is nice for catching Rogues.
---
Alliance warlocks will struggle a bit coming up against Undead because of WOTF undoing fear but just be *aware* of this handicap and react accordingly. 
---
A PVP warlock without fear is still a serious contender so if you want to be good at PVP, you just need to learn how to survive battles with relying entirely on your Fear spell to get out of tough situations.
---
Plus fear will work on all the Orcs/Trolls/Tauren without issue.
---
If there is no layering, the game is going to be basically unplayable for a week or two instead of just an hour. I think layering is a necessary evil, judging from the stresstest. When i finally got layered and was able to progress in leveling it felt like a breeze of fresh air.
---
Druid.
---
So you think peeople will have full engineering, BiS items and 4 others with same gear/profession to dungeon level 30-40?
---
It is 10x easier to level a warrior in classic than on private servers. On private servers they were overpopulated. So yeah
---
already agreed that layering is the lesser of two evils. A name is something of great importance. I hadnt considered the fact that youd contest the same name. Mea culpa. (This could be avoided by simply allowing same names on merge with a simple suffix marked with a hyphen (for e.g. prostate-frostmane) but w/e)
---
Well let me know when you do 40-50 in a couple hours
---
They're coming up with excuses saying server technology is impossible without layering/sharding nowadays. I don't believe that at all.
---
i avoid them like the plague, so it's hard keeping up.
---
What does nr 17 mean sorry? I'm 19 and gotta move into a house-share closer to my work, but I know everyone and the house is all set up and furnished (apart from my room haha). Hope you're all set up and ready to waste many an evening on Zandalari
---
Paladin of the people, streamer of the people.
---
Oh I’ll play. But I’ll also be crying about not getting the best possible game that we could have gotten, because of retail players advocating for retail technologies to be used in the game.
---
What are the most base level crucial addons? As a melee class, what am I supposed to use a swing timer for? What is the consensus for realm choice in NA-East PvP? 
---
Also I think I’m doing something wrong with my movement, as I see a lot of people able to type while moving meanwhile I have to totally pause everything to type something or emote.
---
You are severely underestimating the amount of players on a server, probably on an order of magnitude or more. Servers are going to have AT LEAST 20k players each to begin with. During the stress test alone, queues reached around 5000 - 10,000 for a significant portion of the first hour. You would move up in the queue hundreds every few seconds, indicating it wasnt actually a limit on the population they were allowing into the server (due to layering) but allowing login servers to cope with the number of people coming into the game. Spreading 20,000 or more people between 6 starting areas is a little more troublesome.
---
Hvorfor er der næsten kune svenske guilds på jeres site? Vi er mange danske guilds også! /r/klassiskwow

Right, but if you get scammed then Jagex won't do anything about it, and also if you are caught they will suspend your account.  My friend was suspended for having a RS3 -&gt; OSRS gold swap for a year, he never scammed anyone.  One day, he couldn't log in and support said it was due to that.

Take the warrior! I need dem tanks..
---
Few more days to complete my kill 10 boars quest.

You have to have a trade off. Pick one:
---
You lose your character name because you wound up on a dead ass server and a year later they merge it to another dead ass server.
---
You don't lose your name, and you have to... oh noes! ... invite people to a group sometimes to see them.
---
How will you call for aid in global chat ?  Players that will respond might not be in the same layer as you.  
---
Let's go to Tarren Mill / Southshore and kill some people. You land and there's no one there.
---
For a subreddit that despises streamers so much you sure do link to them and talk about them a lot.
---
Blacksmithing is a pretty deep money sink and Herbalism/Alchemy is a lot better for leveling a warrior.
---
Mining is by far the most time consuming gathering profession. Mining nodes will be the farthest out of your way. Most mining nodes will have to be found deep into hills and valleys. If you're on a PVP server, enemies will camp mining nodes to harass you. Herbalism nodes will be found more regularly around the beaten path and in the wilderness but not tucked up into mountains and hillsides like mining and they wont usually get camped out by enemy PVPers.
---
Alchemy is also by far the more useful profession during the leveling process. Blacksmithing will not always have better gear for your level than quest items. And when the armor does outdo your quest items for your appropriate level the difference will not be huge. And crafting these items will cost you money. The stat bonus from the better armor will not really outdo the benefit of having alchemy potions for a warrior.
---
I'm a warrior and I'm going alch/herb with first aid. As someone else said, get a blacksmith to craft you the BiS gear.
---
Dont touch him...hes perfect...
---
Not by a long shot. All the people who can't handle an authentic experience will go to Pservers to have their every whim catered to.
---
They already introduced a cooldown on swapping layers that fixes any possible exploiting issues. Layering has been continent wide and for all of P1 for months. Deal with it.
---
Comparing Vanilla to Classic graphics on a 1 to 10 scale isn't going to work. The minutiae in the underlying settings is too different.
---
There is very little Blizzard could do to prevent their Blizzard-sponsored-stable-classic-servers from being a huge hit with the vanilla wow fanbase and this layering won’t be it.
---
I believe they said each layer will be the size of a server population from older launch
---
These are the files found related to gamemode in that folder: https://i.gyazo.com/123db03fa872abaa022a4ef0aab43591.png
---
Those servers had dynamic/increased spawn rates. But what happened on Pservers is irrelevant. Classic is a replication of Vanilla WoW, not Private servers. We've seen how inaccurate even the better private servers ended up being. The real vanilla launch had a much different population dispersion than Pservers, and therefor a different experience.
---
it was a meme. The only relevant difference I noticed between left and right was the beard.
---
I doubt many, if any, players that are returning to WoW for Classic will be interested in Retail gold.
---
I know that I won't be logging into Retail, so Retail gold is worthless to me.
---
I have never heard of anyone getting banned for swapping gold. Jagex even stated that it isnt against the rules but that you do it at your own risk. As long as you use community trusted sites then you're fine. I've swapped gold countless times and have never been scammed or banned.
---
What are the Addons for the Map and the Quest-Tracker?
---
24 Ally Guilds &amp; 29 Horde Guilds.
---
Not sure of numbers. There are roughly 1500 in the scandinavian Discord, but that's not representative of population. Many are in the Discord just to observe the server choice.
---
&gt;I've started to feel pretty stupid
---
You could have ended the thread here and it would have been equally insightful.
---
They already are.
---
Pretty sure `Transfer aborted: Instance not found` implies it attempted to layer him on zone change.
---
Imagine joining Goletrash, imagine even joining it's discord. Who would be so stupid?
---
Nope. You'll need to incorporate auto attack on into a macro that starts with whatever ranged ability you are using to pull is.
---
Don't tell me...
---
Had a 60 warrior, and got a rogue to 60 2 or 3 days before TBC launch.
---
&gt;Shaman looks like its the second most populated class on Horde.
---
It only looks like that because everyone that wants to play shaman has to play horde. If they were split between factions it wouldn't look nearly as popular. Same goes for paladins. 
---
On top of that you have a lot of people thinking they will play as one thing but it'll most likely change. According to the survey 60% of warriors (which is also the most popular class) plan on tanking. Game doesn't need that many tanks. A lot of dreams are going to be crushed when they realize not every warrior is going to be leading a top tier raid group.

---
All I'm saying is it's an unreasonable comparison. It's the last day of a stress test. Everything is going to get deleted in 24 hours. Most people have already played, reached 15 and left. There's few people online right now. You can't compare that to a live server with guilds and raiders and tons of activity.
---
A quest popped up offering to get a flying mount. I was like, nope, this ain't happening :)
---
Maybeee wash it first.
---
It seems strange how sure you are about something you can't possibly have any data on. It also seems weird to expect. The game takes over 100 hours just to get to max level, but you think the #1 reason people will quit is because of a behind the scenes mechanic?
---
People have been saying that the way to fix it is to be invited to a party by someone who is on the main UC layer. So if it wasn't a layering bug idk what it was. Whack
---
Yes, Private Servers telling their users to use a VPN is fine. But telling the customers of VladmirsSausageDepot.com and every other business on the now sanctioned hosting provider to use a VPN is not.
---
Who cares, people change their server of choice every day, why do this immedietley as theyre announced?
---
No please. No server transfers in classic. This gives players oppertunity to reset their reputation on a server and start fresh no matter what shitty things they've done.
---
Soo your names are now shared between such huge groups that you almost never get your name, and tourists take all of them.
---
But that amounts to the same thing. There *is* an upper limit (whether technical, convention, or a mix of both) and layering won't magically fix that. I created this post as I heard too many people thinking that layer makes the number of server irrelevant.
---
Thanks for posting this, now we can go with golemagg without worrying about all the annoying swedes

You can see folded clothes next to it... sorry but this was taken in a laundry mat.

I had six on one server, and I think another on a different one?  Something like that.  I had eight seventies on that server when WotLK launched.  I had at least one of everything maxed at the end of WotLK.  I was at character cap before the end of WotLK.
---
You can't bring yourself to play retail because retail is fucking terrible.
---
You could buff cross faction!?
---
Same here. Was trying to get a timer on gouge and it didn't work. Tried pairing it with Omni which does put numeric timers on the cast bar.

hahaha, no that doesn't fix it. the mafia is quite happy with those changes since they don't stop them at all.

ofc theyre experienced but theyre by no means dropping down perfect rogue execution, imagine when the chinese come for soda?

I don't care ? Got no problem, i have no friends ;\_;
---
it's not a 15 yr old game. it's not the same as pservers.
---
classic minimum requirements aren't the same as og vanilla
---
also, pservers peak pop won't compare to overrall classic pop.
---
Agreed. More realms could be added several months after release if there is demand. To be honest, I played in vanilla but I started on a new realm in mid 2006, and I have no idea what patch that was. All I care is getting back to the talent points, no flying, no dungeon finder, etc. Yes, there are some immersion problems and layering is only one of them. I'd accept layering if it meant no streaming. We each have our own desires, but FFS, we're still going to play cause it will be better than retail.
---
You're talking about population spikes when the game initially releases. That's only part of the issue that Blizzard is attempting to solve. They want to have layering when it starts so we can all actually play the game when it comes out. Then once everyone spreads out they remove layering and we get it the way we want.
---
What happens when the population eventually dips and we have dead servers?
---
I do think that we need more servers but not enough where theres 3k per server at launch day. That's going to be a lot that will eventually die within 2 months. Again, this is just a guess by me so what the hell do I know.
---
I wanna join Norrlands Guld, how can I get in touch with them?
---
And if layering didnt exist, you would be posting "this is what killed MMOs, the inability to progress" as there is more population than was ever intended, or is feasible to maintain, in one area.
---
Ignoring the inconvenient arguments doesn't make them go away. But you're a lost cause anyway. :)
---
Whatever, we'll have legit pservers to turn to if Blizz bungled this
---
Probably warrior. Always fun. Never play gnome anything.
---
Name reservations should give them an idea of server population. Probably wont hear anything about additional servers until after that
---
anyone know what addon he is using to make frames and bars dark?
---
It's basically just a copy paste of every other post from the last 6 months lol
---
One :)
---
I won't play the same class/race/role I played before. Time for a little change to keep me entertained.
---
The question right now is whether or not they're purposefully messing with layering during the stress tests in order to fine tune them for official release. Are we being placed in cities with 12 people scattered around them because Blizzard is testing how the system works, or will this happen at launch because they genuinely don't know how to prevent this from happening?
---
Officially, are all layers going to be divided evenly into a new one when it's created? Or will it target a random layer and split off half of it's population? Does layering target specific locations, so that players in one layer are concentrated around durotar and the barrens? Or am I going to be placed with level 30s in another zone while my area is empty?
---
If I keep switching between layers and still see 20 players around me, I'll be annoyed but can hold out until the server populations balance themselves out.
---
But if I go into Org day one and there's no one there, I'm quitting right then and there.
---
Can you do another screen including /who orgrimmar?
---
For all we know there are 10 people in org spread between the hunter trainer, thralls room, weapons skill trainer, the drag, etc.
---
I don't think you can do that
---
Lag? If it was why is it talking about instances then? https://i.imgur.com/K12BLpO.png
---
on PVE servers Alliance outnumber Horde EZ  
---
but who cares about PvE servers right? xD
---
My first character was a undead mage that I leveled to like lvl 30ish and then I created a rogue to try it out, instantly fell in love with the rogue and got it to 60. Then I managed to cap out my mage and made a warrior, I know I didn’t lvl cap the warrior until TBC though
---
the fear is that it's all bullshit and they won't ever removed it
---
Wild is also ridiculously helpful
---
I enjoy the game and only want it to continue being fun. WoW will probably die one day, and that sucks, but like I kinda got around to saying before I realize it's a bit childish to wish failure on a product that others are enjoying. Hey, it may not be my cup of tea, but if it's yours then I wish you nothing but the best. For all sides.
---
Sincerely, someone who would be beyond happy for a Mists server.
---
Do you think there's going to be a twinking scene again, once BGs drop?
---
I loved doing it back in the day because it had a realistic endgoal in terms of gear, no need to upgrade later (which was great for casual play later on). Loved the min-maxing.
---
Especially interested in lvl 19 for now.
---
There is literally 0 hope of anything like this happening, mostly because it's unenforceable. What, do you set min # of viewers to be considered disruptive? What is that #? Is it concurrent viewers or total? 
---
Is it determined by their ingame impact? User-report-driven, and manually verified?
---
I'd take dynamic spawning over layering any day of the week. You asked for the best alternative earlier and just answered your own question.
---
&gt;Classic is a replication of Vanilla WoW, not Private servers.
---
I'm sorry, but I don't quite recall Layering/Sharding/Phasing being a thing in Vanilla, aside from instances perhaps.
---
Where did I defend it?  i simply explained the difference. Thats the problem with this sub is that if you aren't bashing certain topics like the majority they assume your defending.
---
I personally would rather they didnt do layering if I had to give an opinion but its here and its not gonna get changed now so just look forward to when its not in wow classic anymore.
---
Ofcourse it's just acting and not real reactions. How else does anybody watch Asmon and not get this? Just beacuse someone is putting on a show with his behavior, doesn't mean that it's unwatchable. I say this as someone who is not a fan of Asmon either. I found him reaaally weird at first, but the more I watched him, the more I got used to it. But I still find him weird at times. But I just watch other streamers really.
---
I don't fullscreen every twitch clip that gets posted.
---
I was wrong.  I'll get over it.
---
Everyone on this sub is so fucking stupid lmao, just let the streamers play and have fun lol.

Thank you for sharing!
---
If you want to see people banned over a little banter go on r/wow or goletrash discord server. The mod there would be your best friend
---
They've never made an official post stating that.
---
That's not what the terms of service state.  They state that you are at their mercy and they have the right to suspend service for your account without reason.  This is in the TOS for all online games.
---
They don't do that because that would be bad for their business.
---
Blizzard isn't in the habit of explaining themselves just to ease a player's mind. Unless there's something new to report, they'll remain silent. They also very rarely go into detail about the underlying logic of any system or decision, especially anything that could be seen as controversial.
---
I just don't want to deal with cult of streamers and their fanatical fanboys. And also don't want to end up on the server where some big pool of non-english speaking players (who don't have their own language server) will spam general chat in their native language.
---
why don't the old gods swear in their whispers? it would trigger so many people and make them insane
---
Great. Because this was my choice ever since the announcement.
---
I agree. I don't understand pro layering people. I'd rather have massive queues, world server downs, waiting for mob spawns  than the absolute killer of immersion and everything vanilla, that is layering. It's despicable
---
100% the best is when you login and you csnt see the ground because of sl many people in the city. I love that tbh. Makes it feel busy and real.
---
seems like rather arbitrary wishes
---
So then when you have to actually play around layers with your friends and party, you also miss that? No thanks.
---
Where do you see that people think they will be dinging 60 within 2 weeks?
---
They’re being tighter lipped than Epstein on this issue.
---
Roll RP server.
---
I did not write exactly what layering is. What happened in OPs video would not have happened using the method I described.
---
https://youtu.be/rrnw7XuGTJQ
---
Not once did I defend layering. The only thing I said was that your picture is not a realistic classic experience. I don't give a crap about private servers, never did. So you telling me it has more people on them, I don't care about. I want my Vanilla back. Not the abomination that is private servers and retail.
---
I imagine pservers will begin getting C&amp;D notices if they haven't already. 
---
Either way, threatening to quit for a pserver because you didn't get your way is so childish. This subreddit isn't for you if that's your attitude.
---
It should be disabled in cities at least. They're a ghost town right now.
---
No. It's a pvp server...
---
Tourists I imagine. Retail fans.
---
It sounds badass man.
---
Happy trails!
---
I noticed it for the first time during the Blizzcon demo and they haven't changed it yet so I doubt they will. 
---
Hopefully someone makes an addon for Vanilla style combat text.
---
why should he lol
---
I honestly feel like he should also be able to roll wherever he wants, if I were him I’d get sick of salty kids posting about him all day too lmao
---
I choose option for servers with channels that get the collapsed as the population gets too low
---
McDonalds also promises Hot coffee but someone won a million dollar law suite for them accidentally spilling hot coffee on a customer.

The point is, people are going to swap gold between the games.

What a strange thing to say, and to be so pious about something like "ruining your server". weird stuff
---
I like it
---
Hahaha that is amazing man.
---
Yes twinkling will definitely be a thing again especially at 19
---
And we'll enjoy every second of your company my man!
---
Yup, streamers were already getting shitstomped by this guy's guild in beta. They forced Soda to spirit rez 4 times, then camped the GY and he couldn't even do that. That's why Soda said he might not stream until 3 months after release and wants a "blacklist."  Too bad, the people that camp the other side's streamers are going to be folk heroes, not blacklisted.
---
If Soda rolls horde on my server I'm giving away his position to these guys at every opportunity.
---
Can't imagine why you need a throwaway account.
---
so devs saying things needs to be in writing for it to have weight?
---
Here's the problem, what's to stop Asmon and them to just roll on Herod as well? Just because a bunch of random people said so?
---
Make wands and sell them on the AH. Really good money on a fresh server.
---
This is a build that works once you hit 32. I saw summit using it after a viewer recommended it.

---
Interestingly enough, spirit has a higher stat prioritization than Stam. With agility being the highest of the basic stats obviously. You basically never have downtime as ambush (almost always crits with remorseless) --&gt; gouge --&gt; wait for energy --&gt; backstab --&gt; evisc will nearly kill most targets.
---
One last thing is I'm not sure what the best balance between the subtelty stealth talents is, but that's what "feels" right to me
---
There's nothing in WoW's Terms of Service that protects streamers from being killed should they choose to roll on a PvP server and stream their location in real-time.
---
The game launches August 26th 3PM PDT. Right now you can install the game and play on a test realm up to level 15 that goes offline tomorrow morning. Later tomorrow, you'll be able to login to the actual launch servers and create up to three characters per account, but you won't be able to play them, just reserve their names.
---
It's the 26th / 27th timezone depending. Currently there is a stress test all servers and chars are going away
---
Not liking the split between pvp and pve on oceanic servers...
---
This post is beyond relatable. I have some friends that are playing too (separate groups too so will probably wind up on different servers) and I’m the ONLY one with kids and full on career. Definitely keeping an eye on this post. Please keep us updated.
---
&gt; There are more races and classes to choose from
---
With regards to races specifically, less is more. BfA completely fucked the identity of the factions by muddying the waters in regards to silouhette. What the fuck even are Void Elves. Disgusting.
---
Cata had the perfect setup in terms of races. They should never have added any other. Both factions had a good spread of short, tall, lanky, bulky, beastly, elegant races, that all managed to look COMPLETELY distinct.
---
I had a 60 alliance hunter and a 60 horde warrior
---
Don't go gnome... because they fucking suck.
---
Dwarf or night elf is hard - but it's pretty simple to decide whether or not you want pull mobs or heal the dps that pulls mobs.
---
oh my, here we go again
---
I personally don't mind people like Swifty, Staysafe, Tips, MadSeason... and so on but Asmon and Soda can kick rocks.
---
good point. i hope its only for the first week or 2 :) and i hope they fix all these bugs
---
Det finns något dansk, norskt och finskt med. Men ni har väl inte hört av er och engagerat er. Lata jävlar ;)
---
Luckily I'm not the only one that dislikes streamers
---
I'm pretty sure I saw an update for auctioneer on willitclassic
---
Does this include the rare blonde Swedish girl gamer?
---
We don't really have the same streamer problems in EU do we?
---
I read that layering is temporary for the launch. But yeah, I agree it should be turned off for major cities.
---
It's funny, I recall a comment from someone claiming he will only have a 100 followers.
---
Where are you?
---
Sweet
---
I can only praise this steadily growing project. The chemistry between the many members is great and it seems like this discord-community is our best bet if we want to create a fun, healthy and cooperative environment on this new realm.
---
Besides, the creator of this community is well suited for the task of coordinating such a project as well as his team of moderators. He has played similar roles before (e.g., as moderator of a large discord community for another wow RP realm) and always acted fairly and with remarkable skill.
---
Double check your folder locations and names for elvui. It works perfectly for me on the stress test as of right now. Link from willitclassic
---
BiS demon name?
---
Shadowfang Keep after 20, specially if you have 3 casters.
---
Then Blackfathom Depths until you can farm Razorfen and Gnomeregan where your warrior will get nice weapons. After 30 just every part of Scarlet as you level up. 
---
At lvl 40 your party should be super geared thanks to SM, so just farm Razorfen Down, ZulFarrak, Maraudon, the beginning of BRD and Sunken, in that order. 
---
To sum up, grind the ones which have the best gear upgrades and then the ones where you can farm faster but you will probably farm every dungeon.
---
Sry if not well detailed, im on my phone.
---
IS Forsen even a WoW player? Im sure he will play some but I wouldnt worry about him staying long or being a noticeable bad pressence on a server.
---
They have very literally said this is exactly what they're doing in beta and the stress test. But having a conniption about how everything is ruined is what people want to do, apparently.
---
no angry bald streamer man is taking my server !
---
They've said it in a private conversation to a streamer, that doesn't make it an official thing they will follow through on.
---
Still, Horde racials mean more.
---
So 90% dead servers in 2 months? That sounds fantastic!
---
&gt;In UC you can by a lvl 15 wand from a vendor. Cost a bit over 30s.
---
[This](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5208/smoldering-wand) the one you are thinking of?
---
What are you talking about? BfA was flawless launch for Proudmore
---
It's all just the storm before the calm. Once the game is playable, everyone is going to quit bitching.
---
there is an open stress test running til monday.
---
Thanks Melderon. I always appreciate your content. 
---
I just went back to the August Reddit Census survey (linked below) with 30K responses. 28% of  redditors reported that they were already incorporated into a guild. When you add to this already enormous percentage of the WoW fanbase others that are hyped enough to reserve their names in advance, you are actually looking at a significant portion of the WoW community that is committing (with near-finality) to their long-term server tomorrow. Those signing up for their names, those signing up with friends, and those signing up with guilds will not be moving servers. Opening up servers later is not a viable option for a significant portion of the community. I agree with OP in saying, I wish they would double their number now. 
---

Everyone would go to that server and the queue would be literally days
---
LEVEL 18
---
Having 2 English speaking EU PVP servers is not okay.
---
I know that accepting the truth can be difficult. And I think it's cute that you take it for granted that you're made a fool of dota.
---
I'll tell you why: Because Spanish-speaking players put English as their primary language in the dota and end up falling with Brazilians. But these, refuse to communicate the minimum in English and the Brazilian players only have to play with you writing "jajajaja". Peace.
---
I do too. I'd be willing to put up with it for a bit longer, and I hope it gets ironed out before launch.
---
One thing I think Blizzard might be making a mistake on is how few servers are launching initially.
---
Big facts.
---
Population will decline in a pretty staggering way after launch, and I doubt you will get many new players coming in since everything about classic is a known quantity. 
---
'open more servers' is a pretty lazy answer, especially when you know realm mergers will be required as a result of that. Utilizing cloud/VMs in this instance is actually pretty cool. Hopefully the bugs and exploits can be minimized, but layering is a good solution to the problem.
---
"I imagine pservers will begin getting C&amp;D notices if they haven't already."
---
Yeah that has always been the case and it won't change anything.
---
And no wanting a true vanilla experience, which is what we have asked for year isn't childish.  This isnt a threat, just what alot of people will do : Go for the superior product. If Blizzard screw up (which for now seem to be the case) we will go somewhere else.
---
so they get to have fun but we dont?
---
Swing timer is mostly for 2H wielding warriors or paladins. They will be using very slow weapons. Mobs will be hitting faster than you. So you strafe/hamstring kite them by going into melee when your timer is up and dodging out again when it's down (versus sitting there getting hit when timer is down.) Not as important for rogues but still useful. 
---
If you have swing timer you're off to a good start. I'd suggest OmniCC for ability timers, classic aura duration for debuff timers, questie, and if rogue NugEnergy Classic.
---
As far as servers for east PvP it's whatever one the streamers don't pick. Faerlina or Thalnos seems to be where everyone is heading. There is a post of some guy claiming Herod as the people's PvP server going to grief streamers on site but I can't see that dissuading them.
---
I hope there is an EST server that is streamer free, discounting thalnos of course\\
---
"bad words" are a dumb concept to begin with.
---
very immersive RPG gaming! truly are we blessed by blizzard entertainment.
---
They won’t just simply turn it off. They let way more people on one server, that’s why they have so view for release. Think it’s just an economic decision. And it’s probably easier to merge layers than it is to migrate server population.
---
I get why people like it for release day, but it completely fucks with the biggest plus vanilla had over modern wow and that’s the server community’s. I don’t see them completely turning of layering if the let 3 times the players on one server than back in the days.
---
The Screenshot shows why it sucks and it’s the same in zones. I‘d prefer a rocky start on release over empty cities/zones and seeing different people every time i play
---
You just tell the server and server will tell them
---
It's funny I forgot about this until I played classic beta and I'd buff people back, then when I got back on bfa I was buffing people randomly and they would just keep running not buffing me back not even looking my way lmao
---
&gt; I did not write exactly what layering is. 
---
Yes you did, you just changed Layer 1, Layer 2 etc. with Herod 1, Herod 2
---
&gt; What happened in OPs video would not have happened using the method I described.
---
And what happened in this video is also not supposed to happen, it is called a bug
---
Oh poor streamers, boo hoo. I feel so bad for them, making money and ruining a server completely for anyone that wants to do anything but spend time around them. :(
---
Oi have you tried not being so easily offended
---
I haven't heard that in so long, thanks
---
the reason why they don't want to announce which server they will pick is because of the "fans" who will make it near impossible for them to play the game from the minute they announce the server, the starting area will be disrupted by hundreds of fans. not to mention server queues. this happened a lot during the beta.
---
So you decided to make another of the thousand “let’s just stop talking about to posts.” Bold move.
---
I was altoholic and every time new servers launched i raced to 60 unfortunately i never got first close though. At bc launch i had one rogue my main 1 mage 1 druid 1 warlock 4 hunters at 60 all but the mage and rogue were quickly abandoned at level cap. This time around i am sure i will at least 2 alts but i will not be rushing or racing to 60 and my alts will be more to support my main.
---
PvP me irl.
---
Yes, I've played pservers that had launches like this and it was fine after people started spreading out into the world as they leveled up. It was a very short-term and temporary problem l
---
That would be too much at launch lol.
---
It's not the koala scratches I'm worried about... It's the chlamydia
---
Thats more of an issue with layering than with streamers, but thats a whole other can of worms.
---
Idk anybody who has played wow through some rough launches knows it’s just the way it goes. I assume many would be upset for the first while yes. But would it be more than otherwise? Who knows, many will be upset either way.
---
I am in doubt that this works on classic client, but supposedly:
---
/console scriptErrors 1 to display LUA errors
---
/console scriptErrors 0 to hide LUA errors
---
It's not anybody else's responsibility to ensure that others enjoy the game.  If he's on the Blizz payroll that's one thing, but he's not as far as any of us know so he can do whatever the fuck he wants dude.
---
60 human rogue and a 60 undead warrior. I didnt play them as alts I rerolled horde
---
Hey, try refresh - it is intermittently working (due to the owner of the survey spreadsheet changing things I think...)
---
Are you refering to yourself as a wolf? following the streamer around like a sheep? how does that make any sense.
---
Guidelime is an addon with a lot of efficient leveling guides in it. But you're going to revisit areas for bread crumb quests that lead you to new zones.
---
Let it break, it will sort itself out, we are in it for the long game. 
---
People might start collectively choosing different servers or other community solutions.
---
DOnt know what you've got!!!! Tilll it's goOoOne!!!
---
At this point it just looks like sharding without the cross-realm stuff.
---
He's being sardonic here, right?
---
Hilariously crying about being ganked will just make people gank them even more. Adding fuel to the fire just makes it burn hotter and brighter. If you show you clearly don't care about it or happen to be a good sport you'll likely be hunted a lot less because people are actually looking for your reaction, not the simple act of killing you.
---
Guess they aren't smart enough to realize that though. actual griefers feed on negative emotions and reactions, when you deprive them of that they move on to the next person they *can* get that from.
---
...wow what a ruse.
---
Sorry, a couple threads on a subreddit are not indicative of the community at large. Even if it was, you are still not qualified to speak for anyone but yourself.
---
What is a blacklist?
---
No, it's more of an issue with a moronic community and the people that defend it.
---
Seems we'll have a decent bunch as well, myself being one of them.
---
This would be a good point, except streamers aren't doing this. They are keeping their servers secret so they can purposefully ruin the experience of others. Ruining the experience of others is the goal of many of their sheeplets that follow them; and ruining other's experience is "quality" content for these same sheeplets.
---
Streamers profit off of others hating them and being miserable because that is what their followers enjoy watching.
---
It is the weekend and layering people in the same group is not intended, it will be fixed.
---
Layering has nothing to do with performance though.
---
&gt;  its definitely gotten easier on spell usage and regen in the laning stage.
---
which makes the laning stage harder, ask every carry player from here to mars. u could say supports got a lot of conveniance buffs with ward cost etc and if u wana compare that to WoW its more like class changes in TBC/Wotlk where most if not all specs were viable in endgame (which is a good thing imo but mby thats just me). but the thing is WoW got dumbed down (like a lot, who the FUCK decided it was a good idea to remove talent trees), while Dota got some movement into faster paced matches with a shorter and more dynamic laning stage but that did not at all simplify the game or reduce the amount of shit u have to do to not get steamrolled.
---
A layer is on one server a shard is a culmination of different servers.

I haven't seen a single post defending this bug, link?

With only two PvP servers I doubt either of them will be low pop, any difference in population will be minimal.

---
If you use W to move forward I find it easier to bind autorun to shift + w.  I think I would accidentally start typing a lot.
---
I think its either a good choice because both pvp servers are even balanced and populated. Buy im holding out until tomorrow evening to decide because i want to know what server the spaniards are playing on
---
You're in a good spot. Anything under 80ms is great.
---
I really think it should be off anyway but maybe in starting areas - even there I can't think of a proper reason, really. 
---
I'd prefer to see people and not have the same thing ruining social play as x-realm phasing did.
---
&gt; People just want to be a part of the community man and this ruins certain aspects of it.
---
And yet the problems that it fixes, massive queues, dead servers, have a much more massive negative impact on the community. 
---
People would RAGE if Blizz merged their server, even despite it being dead
---
If this happens a couple times on the way to 60, it doesn't destroy the community aspect. It's a minor inconvenience that might sometimes require a relog. 
---
End of the world I suppose. Let's just demand 5 hour queues or dead servers in 6 months for a true vanilla community feeling
---
Priest is a great class for duoing with a warrior, anything that can heal is a warrior's best friend though really.
---
You could use this:
---
&gt;/equip Daggername  
---
&gt;/cast !Stealth
---
The problem? When you press this key while in combat: you won't enter stealth, it will swap your weapons, and it will put you on the global cooldown for all of your other abilities. I can think of plenty of situations where you're trying to leave combat to enter stealth and you don't want this to happen.
---
The safer way to do this is to bind your dagger to Ambush:
---
&gt;/cast Ambush
---
This will swap to the dagger and cast Ambush at effectively the same time as long as you are not in combat. If you ever happen to be in combat while also in stealth (rare but it can happen), note that the first press will trigger the GCD. You will have to wait a second before pressing this macro again and using Ambush.
---
You will need a separate key to swap back to your sword after using Ambush. This key will trigger the GCD if used in combat:
---
&gt;/equip Swordname
---
This macro will always equip your sword if your dagger is equipped. It also equips your dagger if your sword is equipped - not 100% necessary but it doesn't hurt to put that line in there in case you want to have the option.
---
They would make another subscription. If blizzard banned a gold seller account that person would just make another account with a sub.
---
Even tough the survey has a huge sample size you shouldn't forget that it's biased. People who are active in the subreddit are the most dedicated players, those don't represent the average player, the point most influence by it is probably pvp/pve server choice. Without blood elf on the horde side I imagine people who play less and possibly prioritize ascetics more then a min/max player will rather roll alliance. But overall I'm happy that horde/alliance will probably be more balanced out then ever!

---
Dude get better internet
---
Not everyone who watches twitch is a moron, just like not everyone who doesn't is going to do their best to preserve your specific classic expectations.
---
can you give an example for this type of information you are concerned about?
---
Herod will, without a doubt, have streamers on it. The idea of a community declared "people's server" is nice, but it isn't realistic.
---
I got every class to level 60 except mage and rogue, and I had two level 60 warriors (tauren and dwarf) on different servers. Then I discovered a Blizzlike private server called Emerald Dream in 2013 and leveled a mage and rogue to 60.
---
The only class I would never roll again is warrior.
---
You predicted this bug? Amazing!
---
If you have a slow 2h weapon you can do a thing called jousting.  You hamstring or otherwise slow your opponent, swing and then backoff and get out of range.  They may attack much faster then you, but cannot connect because of the range, then when you see your swing timer complete go back into melee range for a moment.  You and your opponent will both attack, but if he has a fast weapon and you a slow one that 1 for 1 trade is massively in your favor.
---
Lots of us normal, regular people don't idolize anyone to that degree. I think the guy's question has more to do with that, the pure bevilderment of seeing someone be that weird and pathetic.
---
bad?   good
---
No its still a pvp server
---
Ok. 
---
Now imagine that this person on your block who you don't like, well, they're dickbags. And they're on the HOA. They park in front of people's driveways. They use the HOA to issue tickets to people who they don't like, whether deserved or not. They think they own the block, and unfortunately, they have enough people supporting them that it's kind of true. 
---
When they go to these block parties, they have their cronies give them all the good food and all the good booze. They get to cut first in line to all the games, and get the best seats in front of the band just because. 
---
Ok, so maybe you know well enough to not go to the block party they're going to. Because you're on the local forum and you keep up with these things. But you know that a lot of your neighbors are sort of out of the loop. And they might go to the block party with this dickbag because they don't know any better. And they'll be deeply dissapointed, miss out on the fun, and might, in fact, never go to any block party again. 
---
That, of course, makes the dickbag more powerful, because no one is challenging the dickbag's position. So now they basically get a whole block party to themselves. Did they earn it? No. They bullied themselves into that position. 
---
You're outraged. You hate bullies and you hate to see people exploited. You know that knowledge of the dickbag's bad behavior will spread, and people who might have moved to your neighborhood will now avoid it entirely because of the dickbag. In all, the dickbag having free reign will hurt your block and your community.
---
So, staying entirely within the law and HOA bylaws, you begin to fight back. You gather your own group of neighbors. You go to the block party with the dickbag, and you prevent him and his cronies from taking more than their fair share. And while you might not be able to unseat the dickbag, you vote his cronies out of the HOA and you start ticketing him when he parks in front of peoples' driveways, and ultimately, you give a voice to all of the other neighbors on your block who are involved in your community. 
---
The dickbag is still allowed to participate. No one is kicking him out of his house. But he has to play by the same rules as everyone else, and he can't shield himself from the social consequences of being a dickbag by hiding behind a pile of cronies. 
---
Even a brief moment of self reflection is enough to realize who the unreasonable dick in this scenario is.
---
If I see someone advertising req. iLvl for a group I will not join that group - it will just point out bad players.
---
Damn I totally forgot about this. It’s gotta be at least 10 years since I’ve seen it. Good shit
---
It makes sense Scandinavians want to join English servers. Sweden's servers have been speaking Arabic for years!
---
Hosting bare metal isn’t dead. And there are good reasons to do it, hence why StackOverflow and GitHub still do it (there are more, those are just two that come to mind).
---
right. more good things thx blizz
---
Im not sure if it's fair to say we don't grasp the concept of layering, Im of course going to first see how it works out on launch. These reddit posts &amp; my retail experience with the layering/sharding mechanic makes me uneasy, and if phase 2 takes a long time to arrive then I think we'll lose a lot of players to layering frustrations before then.
---
It's important to recognise that streamers like Asmongold build their brand largely through drama. 
---
This whole speech was designed to rile people up, and consequently have them link his content for some easy marketing. Hate to say it, but posting this here really is just playing into his hands.
---
My advice? Don't get too upset over "big talk", because usually that's all it is. Best thing to do is ignore such people altogether. Nothing scares a streamer more than being irrelevant. 
---
If he really does cross lines that shouldn't be crossed (e.g. ToS violations), then those can be reported and raised with Blizzard. Until then, try to resist taking the troll's bait folks.
---
&gt;Reply
---
That build will leave you wanting more in both pve and pvp.  If you're raiding in a guild, put more points in combat.  If you're pvp'ing, go more sub'.
---
Wtf this I just read?
---
And I can tell from your sub par argumentative skills that you're not a true Scotsman.
---
buckle up, apparently Assmondgold saw the Herod post on the Classic forum, pretty sure he is rolling there out of spite now
---
I used to use general chat to organize groups for dungeons all the time, so maybe. 
---
Point is an addon is a bandaid fix that doesn't really fix the issue.
---
I'm looking forward to this to be updated.
---
Ion\_Hazzikostas literally said this.
---
Soy
---
Im not disguising anything. I think you’re hung up on that when I meant to say connected realms. Cross realm is like 15 servers. Connected is just 2-3 servers. My argent dawn and scryers characters are basically on the same realm. Cross realm is just like crbgs.
---
Yes, it is? The other option is to have ~10+ servers worth of players all trying to play with each other at the same time.
---
And no, making a lot of servers at the beginning and then merging them later is not an option. That utterly destroys the server's community. Even more than layering.
---
I want to avoid streamers as much as the next guy but watering down the RP server is a dick move too. I don't want my experience ruined by streamers, why would I ruin the RP player's experience by crowding up their server?
---
Makes it obvious that this literally is nothing more than janky rebranded sharding
---
Do we get to save 3 names per server tomorrow or just 3 names across the board?
---
Yes, I understand that... But it's a loss of money to get banned with an active sub. I know it's not a total block, but it's a hurdle and a "risk" to botting an account
---
I don't see the point of giving people the choice when the system can balance population automatically and far more efficiently. It also defeats the purpose of layering if everyone can just force themselves into a certain phase. And it wouldn't be "whitemane-1 to whitemane-5" there would be hundreds of these "channels" at launch. Now add players manually swapping themselves between those channels and it gets really heavy. The only reason I could see wanting to manually join another phase would be to play with friends, which you can already do if you're in a party...
---
https://discord.gg/dEdGQht
---
Horde has stronger racials for pvp with orc stun resist and undead fear break.
---
Alliance has some alright pvp racials as well, but certainly not as strong as horde.
---
As for class specific, paladin is a much stronger healer than shaman, but ele shamans are also powerful in pvp
---
Idk. APES are rolling there apparently.
---
So you’re trying to tell me a shitty server run by dubious means with a population cap more than double what is was originally and people on every time zone is a better representation of what classic was like than Blizzards official remake which isn’t even out yet, and you’re basing this on a stress test where they are testing the thing you are bitching about?
---
Which are BR aka Thalnos... there is still no confirmation that LA are going to Faerlina...
---
&gt; Not everyone who watches twitch is a moron
---
No, but the people that are going to come to the game and spam about him are. They all are.
---
"BuT iTs N0t sHaRdinG"
---
people said this shit would end in disaster and it was sharding.  
---
now its sharding people away from groups, npcs, trainers and so on.. and yet people defend this shit.
---
Sharding is present, and core game mechanics are still broken, even tho its been reported since the blizzcon demo. 2 pvp servers in eu meaning (im guessing)  100k+ players per realm in hundreds of different shards.
---
Thank you blizzard for the "authentic experience"
---
Start the petition. 
---
REMOVE LAYERING FROM CLASSIC WOW!
---
Layering is going to ruin the game, which is fine, because people will stop playing and the execs at Blizzard will feel vindicated that retail is better than Classic.
---
Or, people will keep playing a worse version of vanilla and the execs at Blizzard will feel vindicated that Layering was a "success", even if the only player base left are those that don't care about immersion and community or staying true to the original game.
---
A quick horde only include for melee dps and hunter would be the Rune of the Guard Captain. Trinket from  a Hinterlands Quest with +20 AP and 1% hit.
---
I'll likely do that. Just gonna wait till after naming day.
---
As a kiwi I WISH I could make time to play this game....such good memories
---
Their pve differences are minor.  If you pvp hardiness on orc makes it the clear choice.
---
We don't know the ip's from any of the actual servers yet, since they are not even online yet. And for me at least the european stress test server doesn't even reply to pings, it's only open on port 3724.
---
Here is the info of the ip from the stress test servers: 
---
 [https://whatismyipaddress.com/ip/37.244.63.183](https://whatismyipaddress.com/ip/37.244.63.183)

---
No, basically i played retail mostly to lvl characters since during day time in Korea it's either really late at night or really early in the morning in EU.
---
It would be easier to raid in US time zone + less ping.
---
In the end it's up to you where you wanna play.
---
First give him lots of gold, then give him lots of praise, and finally if you are top notch ass kisser THEN he might notice your existence.
---
Literally the only purpose of layering is to solve overpopulation. The alternative is to have 10 layers worth of people all trying to play at the same time.
---
1) 2000 is a very, very lowball estimate. Think 10x more. 
---
2) not every starting zone will have an even distribution of players. There will be far more dwarfs than trolls. 
---
3) even f your numbers were right, why would you even want that? The game would be frustrating for the first few days. They’re already planning on removing layering once the initial surge of players has passed.
---
"stop assuming whenever you want"
---
"he rest of your post reads like something on r/incel so I'm not touching that."
---
Maybe you should start by stopping assuming whatever you want too first.
---
As someone who's been around since 1.12. play what you want. Yeah dwarf is good and easily BIS, but you are going to spend hundreds of hours looking at your character. The flavor, the animations, the model, how gear fits - it all matters to most people, and by virtue of asking this question it likely matters to you. If you aren't in Method, you'll be fine.
---
It's already in your launcher. And you just need an active subscription
---
Party/Raid frames are working for me with the [latest update](https://git.tukui.org/elvui/elvui-classic/tree/development).
---
Lack of **spontaneous** wpvp. I'm sure some guilds will organize pvp events
---
I can not pick between:
---
* Priest
---
* Warlock
---
* Rogue
---
I kinda just want pros and cons. I will be leveling with my hunter friend most likely. We were mostly leaning twords warlock and his brother was saying priest as id be able to go shadow and dps and still be able to heal anyways. Im more of a PvE player but my friend is a heavy PvP'er so ill be doing alot of both.

Everyone should boycott name reservations.  That'll show 'em.
---
Probably 20k+ players from Scandinavia alone. 2 PVP servers. Lol.
---
So I can download it now to be rdy?
---
I completely and absolutely agree.
---
You forgot alcohol addiction and overtime
---
DEFINITELY! I'm down for the cause.
---
Hunter is very bad dps for raiding, biggest reason you are there is to kite mobs. So no, not getting maximum beneficial buffs from a class that deals bad dps is not ok if you play in a guild that wants to progress.
---
People say that but I've yet to see one that was realistic and objectively better.
---
Can someone explain? I haven’t played in years, but I can’t see why having a couple streamers on your server would change anything at all..
---
Yeah, this is what bothers me about the anti-retail narrative. They make it seem like it has all been unenjoyable shit since Wotlk. I had a fucking blast playing Legion. BfA was very disappointing in comparison but Legion is an example that classic is not the only way this game can be good.
---
Yes I understand, Bobby B. I will change it immediately.
---
That doesn't make much sense, the walls should be server side not client side, sure they could make it invisible by deleting its textures or asset but the world should still think it exists and have a barrier.
---
yarp
---
OH, IT'S UNSPEAKABLE TO YOU? WHAT HER FATHER DID TO YOUR FAMILY, THAT WAS UNSPEAKABLE!
---
I was a unnecessarily rude with my comment and I apologise for that.  Blizzard literally took Sharding, called it something else, and expanded the area, and now that Classic is becoming hyped up we have retail players coming in and acting like that's OK.  I see that's not the case with you, but it's frequent and pervasive.
---
Score
---
Imagine reading all of that ... coz I didn’t
---
Is it? Why wasn’t the cataclysm launch a catastrophe without layering implemented?
---
Oh man, I had to wait an entire _15_ minutes to log in! And the NPCs were all blocked by a Tauren on a mammoth! Oh no! 
---
I actually enjoyed launch day quite a bit, it was fun chaos. The DCs were maybe once an hour. I whole heartedly would prefer that over continent-wide layering. 
---
They could have done much better than layering. Sure it’s all they have now, because they don’t have the time to create a different system with classic just around the corner. Doesn’t mean they _shouldn’t_ have done it a better way.
---
It shows up as a "version" of WoW on the same menu where you choose between retail and PTR, I downloaded it today.
---
Do layering allow you to chose your layer when you log in? I think that would probably be the best of both worlds, it would leave a bit of control in the hands of the player and will be generated and managed on the fly has population grow or shrink.
---
https://www.vanilla-questing.me/
---
Your literally replying to my comments and totally ignoring the comment where I specifically say im against layering you absolute mongoloid. Do more than 3 seconds of reading before you comment next time.
---
Didn’t catch that yeah that’s bullshit
---
This is what I was thinking as well appreciate it! Figured you can create but not “enter world”
---
My bad I probably should have blocked out most of the chat
---
Probably questing and mob grinding. Donations would make it a lot easier if you can get people to join up early.
---
Y'know houlw it is it varies so I may be online those times some nights
---
Any news is good news
---
In all seriousness, PvE servers usually suffer from having a higher Alliance population every time. With a name like Mankrik, there's pretty much a guarenteed home for any and all Horde PvE'ers. (At least that's what surveys are showing so far.)
---
A weaponswing timer saved me so much time and damage that I rarely needed to drink while leveling to 10. Something to consider.  For example I learned that wrath spam against nightsabers isn’t often worth it since their attack speed is so high and they can push you back 2-3 times per cast.
---
&gt; 24 have signed, let's go to 100!
---
humm no
---
Makes all the people defending it even funnier
---
And if Matt Damon didn't make an absurd amount of money from acting... or Lebron James didn't make an absurd amount of money from playing basketball... or Tom Brady didn't make an absurd amount of money from playing football... or... I'm gonna stop there. He was able to get a bunch of people to pay him to play games, it's no different from any actor or athlete. Just because it's something you're not capable of doesn't mean you have to be so jealous.
---
Blizzard this is NOT OK. This is happening everywhere. I was playing with a priest I met, then he leaves my group because we thought we were going separate directions. He instantly disappears.
---
We were then whispering each other and realized we are going for the same quest and invite each other and get back on the same layer. But how the fuck were we on the same layer originally both of us solo questing, group up and drop group, and all of a sudden phase out of each others' layer? It's not supposed to happen.
---
I AM SUPPOSED TO KEEP SEEING THE SAME PEOPLE SO I HAVE A SOCIAL EXPERIENCE. I don't want to see people disappearing around me like in retail. It's really fucked!
---
I remember in the first implementation of Dungeon Finder people would say "hello" or something at the start of the dungeon then nobody had time to say anything else because we were moving so fast. Wrath of the Lich King had good rewards for doing the heroics even if you didn't need the loot that dropped there so we were often overgeared and destroyed everything, it was natural for the tanks to start zooming through and pulling as much as possible. 
---
I chatted a bit more when Cataclysm came out and we had to at least communicate crowd control stuff because stuff in those dungeons. There's a very short period of time where people have to take early dungeons slower than usual but I agree that the dungeons was likely the main reason they started talking in the first place. Cataclysm made you run to dungeons again and people hated it so much they allowed you to teleport later on.
---
Not exactly the case. Its not the individual, its "hey this party I go to will have 50,000 people, be overcrowded to the point where you can't get in, and they will all be so loud and abnoxious that you won't even be able to hear the music or have any normal conversations... oh and btw I'm not telling you which venue that will be except it won't be two of these 5, good luck!
---
Yeah tbh he's the one wow streamer I can watch heaps of.
---
Just chill dude who doesn't act like a manchild.
---
Also dunno how he does it but he's got a knack for keeping viewers engaged.
---
According to that one developers clip this is maybe how it was supposed to work?
---
Once the # of x mobs reached a certain point it forced spawned new mobs. It is interesting that its the same mob over and over but could just be rng or because of coding.
---
Anyways based on the bluepost they also put out I think this is working as intended, just looks weird.
---
Thanks alot for the input, I'm really grateful!!
---
it's a little colored bar just left of the bags
---
One with a level 55 alt just before TBC launched.
---
That's not bad lol
---
I dont dislike... "streamers", I dislike specific people who happen to stream. I enjoy some streamers like Bajheera and venruki, and I hate some like asmon and tips...
---
The Horror. I actually enjoy watching a few streamers including Asmon... but holy crap I have no intention of playing on their servers.
---
how much are you getting paid to prostitute yourself so hard for Blizzard?
---
asmongold is the wow equivalent of professional wrestling
---
Thanks, didn't know about this restriction. I think i will look around those sites the next days.
---
Yes you *can*. We don't know what limit Blizzard has artificially imposed on each realm. It could be 50k, it could be 100k, it could be 250k, it could be 500k, etc. But whatever it is, it's just a number Blizzard decided on.
---
I remember searching for nodes between durotar and The barrens in that river that divides it. And The nodes changed based on what side of The river I was in, or what zone I was in. This was on a private server tho.
---
well this culture did exist back when we played. it's a level 1 city crawl. they happened fairly often. and so did massive griefing events. i remember participating myself, and i remember laughing my ass off at the many screenshots being posted on forums lol
---
i wonder.. if there were an end-of-beta event happening tomorrow, how many 'i don't understand why these losers would follow around a S T R E A M E R' people would participate? c'mon. you know you'd check it out. and you're going to take screenshots. you're going to record videos. you'll have your mind blown at the community experience. what's different here? it's the same level of enthrallment. only that streamer culture is a scene you don't belong to so you don't "get it", i imagine.
---
but if streamers were around back in the day you know damn well there would be  streamer hunter guilds that hunted streamers and their fanclubs. it would have been glorious. because they would have been uploading their content to websites like spikedhumor or digg and you would have ate that shit up. imo that's something i really look forward to. the controversy in the scene and the potential rivarly between alliance/horde (cause you KNOW these streamers are gonna be alliance fucks)lol
---
Vanilla experience was in 2004, it's impossible to get that experience 15 years after the original release.
---
Too far dude, he may come off as a jackass but he's based and definitely wouldn't partake in that shit.  I'm all for calling him what he is, but Epstein aside, I don't believe for one second that dude is into ANY of that shit.
---
People playing the stress test have no objective at all progression wise, so you can't get in their way.
---
Come launch, things will be different.
---
But then you just put a barrier infront of switching channels too often, such as having to log out and wait a minute or go to a capital city.
---
Simple question: yes or no?
---
Don't think that's necessary. There's an easy way to navigate the spreadsheet. To the left of the tabs is an icon of 4 horizontal lines, the "All Sheets" icon. Click on it and it'll show a scrollable list of the tabs in order.
---
Svennar är överallt, inte vårt fel att vi är så jävla sexiga.

Sad thing is that I'm not sure if he's joking or not
---
Probably those who don't speak English...
---
no, you had to be atleast 35. you sir are indeed fake news, as someone linked above. [https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-professions-overview#profession-ranks](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-professions-overview#profession-ranks)
---
&gt;basically unplayable for a week
---
Sounds pretty blizzlike to me.
---
One of my favorite guilds was a Portuguese guild called "Afterhours" - I joined them only because they raided late night and actually had okay progression.  The raids were in English but they did frequently switch languages during downtime.  Anyway, it worked and I had a good time with them.  Didn't really make any friends though because of the language barrier.
---
I 100% understand layering.
---
Fuck Layering, Spin up more servers instead.
---
Yep, so let's just say screw it and completely ruin everything! Wooooooo!
---
Best use of eyes of the beast in the stress test
---
This is great news for the server. Now Forsen and the Spanish just have to go Golemagg and we'll be in the clear.

be fair, though. this was on the stress test server on which everybody knows the admins will spawn crazy shit on asmongold's group.
---
Can someone explain the server situation to me? I'm out of the loop. I'm at the point where I'd like to look into a good server for launch
---
Thank god we have all these PvE-servers for a few hundred people to play on in Europe
---
the servers don't exist yet
---
The streamers have fanbases of 30,000-50,000 people who swarm the server and shit things up to get his attention. Beyond the simple swarm of people, it disrupts the server economy because they have legions of fans farming things out for them and camping world bosses and rares and every node to funnel stuff to the streamer so they don't need to work.
---
A lot of people just don't wanna deal with it.
---
The tourists would stay to play the game if they made social connections and form relationships.
---
This is much less likely to happen under layering + dynamic respawns.
---
I kind of remember stuff like this happening to me occasionally in Vanilla when there were server issues.
---
I left it out because 1) you won't get it, and 2) if you do you won't need to refer to my prebis Rogue list.
---
If the ping wasn't so awful I would go play with the Aussies.
---
What’s wrong with merging servers?
---
make an orc or troll and valley of trials and you'll see it. `/console ffxglow 1` to turn it back on.
---
We are in for the long game, the wast majority of people don't have the time they would like to spend on the game, and they certainly don't have the time too spend hours and hours not getting to play the game. Without layering we'll lose thousands of players, no doubt.
---
Agreed. We need more posts that are regurgitated memes or complaining about streamers.
---
Why is streaming a game asking to get ganked?
---
Years later Teldrassil was burned to the ground while a troll named Roobin smiled in the background.
---
I wish it just didn't exist tbh.  I'm playing the stress test and see no one because of it.
---
If Classic fails, I can promise you it's not going to be because a couple thousand turbo nerds clutching their fucking service dogs and screeching about layering decided to boycott the fucking game. 
---
That's what they'll blame it on, of course, but they'll be wrong as they are about most things.
---
I'm not denying anything. I'm also not defending layering. Layering has problems. All I'm saying is this image is a totally unreasonable comparison, but nobody else seems to understand that.
---
Twitter is host to a lot of extremists.
---
INV ASMON LAYR spam is not enjoyable for anyone, including the streamers.
---
Two 60s during vanilla, Rogue and a Warrior. Then a Belf Paladin at TBC release to 64
---
Guests go home, they don't stay forever and make you want to kill yourself because they won't stop partying at 3am.
---
Steamers have literally gone on record as staying they hope the server is ready to get a big dick because they intend to fuck it. Basically a direct quote.
---
Forsen has said that he won't be streaming classic WoW (there's a clip floating around somewhere), but idk about the Spanish.
---
Of course we kind of need it and it is not perfect, but there already enough proof that it is not working properly and we have no word from blizz about it, if there is a solution for a fix that problem has been there for a while.
---
Also you are saying you wont complain at all or be piss  once you get forced into a layer and get separated from your friends, you might get put into a layer with nobody in it. you will be stuck 72h into it because of the cooldown, also your friend won't be able to join you back since they might have already used the cooldown for joining you at the beginning? ,
---
Fucking disgusting.
---
Ok cool I totally understand. From what I’ve heard, warriors rarely end up using two handers because dual wield dps is far superior right? One aspect that I love about warriors is 2h but if I’m gonna be using one handers for the majority of the game I’d rather just go rogue

You are broadcasting your position in a pvp game. That's like playing paintball and screaming HEY GUYS I'M OVER HERE and then being mad when someone walks over and shoots you lol.  If you don't want to get ganked, don't give out free intel on where you are.
---
Lol no it's not.
---
Sword spec is better for solo if possible as well
---
I don't even understand it's purpose in the open world. The only way I see it is that it exists so that blizzard doesn't have to make more servers. All the BS about servers dying and needing to merge servers seems like a non issue, layering definitely creates more problems than it solves.
---
The feeding part is that it’s not an mmo. It’s a new different game. If you like competitive raids and competitive m+ it’s fun, but it’s not an mmo anymore so people who want and love mmos wont like it. It’s just a new category at this point. I personally could handle about 3 months before I was too bored in my day to day to continue
---
If you have 20 hours invested 2 days after release your not really a casual. I'm talking about people who don't even know that Classic exist.
---
its exactly the same, I dont understand why more people dont get this
---
layering = sharding
---
Just because you haven't had to deal with the ramifications doesn't mean the entire concept is dumb.
---
I'm fairly certain a good number of people appreciate that they can go somewhere without being called a N-word while people laugh. I'm sure they also don't appreciate when that still happens. 
---
The problem is when there is an attitude behind the word. That concept is what makes them "bad". It's a whole lot of psychology and emotion summarized in a "fk you".
---
All that said, in the oceanic community I don't know if there is any of that negative connotation with c*nt, so it may be appropriate.
---
They essentially owned every single private server that they rolled on. There are many good private server guilds, but none of them are autistic enough to even approach what APES are capable of doing.
---
I’m glad we have layering. Least I’ll get to actually play the game when I choose.
---
Reminder that Blizzard said CRZ would never be in current expansion content in MOP.
---
The first server I played on in vanilla there were MANY Swedish players.  
---
Most read thing in whispers and sometimes even general chat was: Swe?
---
They could link the servers in terms of player names. making merking much easier without having people lose their names.  You're correct to think that layering will stay untill the end of time. because if they push 50-100k on a server and expect it to fall down to a reasonable 3000 they're fucking delusional
---
Dwarf priest. Game needs way more healers not more warriors. But if you do make that night elf war, make male. Alliance doesnt need any more ladyboys.
---
I didn't know the chinese were any good.  I only remember them as lvl 60 hunter gold farmers in crappy gear
---
Exactly, classic opens to each timezone at midnight so EU gets to play before NA, est before pst ect ect
---
I totally fell asleep...ugh. It did work! So if you mail something to an alt you haven't logged into, they DO get it when you log in!
---
For the horde
---
It's not necessarily that we CAN'T play on those servers. We have every right to join the Spanish or Portuguese servers. Nobody ever said otherwise.
---
Ah, you must feel so culturally enriched rn
---
Is it sad that this was the first thing that came to my mind as well?
---
Yes it is. A healthy spirit pool means you don't have any downtime while leveling. Your divine shield protects you from DMG so Stam is useless. 
---
Endgame is different but for leveling int and spirit are best.
---
140ms isnt unplayable.  That's about what I get as a NA player playing on EU private servers
---
Filthy alliance
---
It’s gone after phase one which is the bright side to it. Honestly lots of spergers have been raging about it, but without layering and the dynamic respawns (only in starter zones iirc) competing with 10000 people for 8 mobs would be quite obnoxious.
---
Because this is World of Warcraft an mmoRPG, if you wanna min/max, yeah maybe BS is not for you, but dude, sometimes you just gotta be the guy who is standing by the fire swinging a huge hammer beatin' on some metal
---
if done without preparation it will coz naming issues more than anything. luckily there are precautions that can prevent this, but blizzard doesn't seem to care.
---
Yea, the sub went from mild aggro and hype to complete "CLASSIC IS DEAD THEY LIED THEY'RE LYING THEY WANT IT DEAD ON ARRIVAL THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY'RE DOING ITS OVER!!2!!1!!" within a week, I think I'm gonna check out till launch.
---
Purely anecdotal but I tried a pserver recently and after this weekends stress test I feel my weapon skills were staying much closer to max while leveling compared to the pserver.
---
Ruin what exactly? Vanilla experience? That is not possible unless you have a time machine.
---
Is it a misinterpretation if it’s literally how it works?
---
Its wow where they just hand you everything on a silver platter.. if that's what you like then by all means.
---
Just wait until the names are reserved, at that point they're locked in and could probably release where they are since nobody can now steal them.
---
Then people can plan what they want to do.
---
Make sure to monetize their reactions.
---
Oh no way, and for endgame any shot I could use something like arcanite reaper and put up good dps?
---
I kind of wish they left the ability to have multiple people tag quest mobs, it's just faster and less annoying but I'm not butthurt about it.
---
Playing a rogue on stress test, with that att speed. Its the instant they drop them, so ez to oom out shammys if they over commit to the totems
---
Definitely not but the point is that you have choice that matters in this game and you can express your skill and game knowledge with. That is fun and engaging. Tried the last WoW Expansions, quit each after 24 hours because I could not stand everything being dumbed down to a point a monkey could play blindfolded.
---
Because there’s no better solution. /thread and stfu
---
Then overthrow them.
---
Work with the anti-streamer groups to make the streamers' lives hell until they give up and and reroll on Thalnos.
---
lol no
---
it will be forever, there is no going back.
---
no bad vibes no bad vibes no bad vibes
---
me feel good me feel good me feel good
---
trump bad immigrants good smash racism
---
I would say if you want interesting then we’re talking Fire Mage, you’ll be flying by the seat of your pants.
---
Roll Gnome for comical effect.
---
Lionheart's Helm will make you bank. Weapon Chain &amp; Spurs are always sought after. Nightfall will be sought after from most raiding guilds. 
---
That's all I can think of. There isn't much to make consistent money, but they are necessary to have.
---
I for one am going Tailoring, which has very little profit margin until ZG. The best items for tailoring pre-ZG are BOP.
---
Set it to hotkey 1 and use it every time you log in
---
its 2/5
---
To add, there are very few servers. I want to play east coast, pvp, no streamers and play with English speakers- I effectively have 1 server to chose from. And I don’t know which one, cause I don’t know where streamers are going. It’s not the end of the world but frustrating
---
Don't bother, the people you're trying to reach are permanently unhappy.
---
Blizz would ban all of them for life.
---
Why wouldn't you roll warrior again? Just because you've done it twice?
---
I thought you'd only switch layers when invited to a group. 
---
I thought you would never be in a different layer than your group.
---
I thought you would always be in the same layer as your guild.
---
I thought layering would be just like playing on a normal full server with 3k people.
---
Why did I think those things? Because blizzard lies.
---
Or, and I know this is hard for you to grasp, just see what server they all go to and pick a different one. It’s like all of have a hard on for streamers at this point. It’s like you want them to come to your server just so you can complain.
---
I watched quite a few videos of both, and it seems that the Oogas were "tolerated" by the Alliance streamers because they were usually pretty classy and didn't gank the same streamer more than once every so often. They also operated as bodyguards against stream snipers for the Horde side. 
---
On the other hand, Richturpin and his lads usually gank repeatedly while maintaining at least one Rogue stationed at the closest graveyard to kill those who opt for rez sickness. They don't defend their Alliance streamers against Horde stream snipers, and even though some anti-streamer people enjoy their griefing as some form of "justice", Richturpin has made it fairly clear that he ganks purely for personal enjoyment and attention.
---
Wow that seems like a really lame way to play. I assumed multiboxing meant having a tank, healer and dps and having some clever macros to hold it all together... not just piling four mages on top of each other and having them follow you around.
---
Basically grind out reps for resist gear plans for raids.
---
There’s plenty of people who currently play retail and plan to play both
---
I lost a lot of respect for Baj when he did the whole anti-vape propaganda stream.
---
Why would they have normal layering behaviour for a test? It just doesn't make sense. This isn't a discussion about whether or not someone is for or against layering, it's about the behaviour in the stress test not being representative of layering in the actual release but people are acting as if it is and calling for the doomsday because of it.
---
hmm that's conflicting. On the one hand scandinavians are in my experience often really fun people but on the other hand shattered hand eu is pretty much the unofficial scandinavian server on retail and they barely speak english in trade chat
---
If you speak English then you will be on Shazzrah in EU, unless they release more PvP servers..
---
I guess this is my home now.
---
HELL YEAH
---
For honor and dark souls will always be my side baby's and is my safe net to fall back on.
---
I needed to read this, thank you very much, helped a lot.
---
Oh. Been gone from the game for a while.
---
I think even more potent to this is you can actually feel your power grow and each upgrade feels good. Part of this is itemization, but also you know 100% where damage you deal is coming from and 100% where damage you take is coming from. There's so many passives and weird other shit in the game now that you literally have zero clue what your spec is even doing and you can't see an additional chunk of stats' effect.
---
I agree.  Perhaps it is simply the joy of crafting your own gear while leveling, made from the copper ore you fought through hordes of kobold to mine that makes BS a good profession.
---
Ah makes sense. Thanks.
---
Tailoring for bags / good chest at 60 and Leatherworking just for extra gold while leveling up on a crowded server (and some tailoring recipes use leather). Some players may be underestimating how gold starved you are early on. Can drop those at 60 after you craft your chest piece and go into whatever now that you've learned much more about the game.
---
Man no idea I just googled it. I’ll try find the link and reply later
---
You see people from other realms because the population is so thin on individual realms now they had to squash them all together.  Then classic comes along and they have to layer them because the population is too thicc.
---
I honestly think classic population numbers are going to exceed that of retail.
---
whaaaaaaaat? that would be just like vanilla, who would want that? u crazy
---
This happened to me last night on my level 2 paladin.
---
Attack power was 33. With BoM it buffed it up to 53. 
---
tHaT's a LoTTA dAM@%e
---
im getting more and more worried the more i test the things with layering...
---
I have the same issue with games. 
---
Been debating reading the first wow novels or possibly playing through warcraft 3 (though I wanted to wait for remastered and think its incredibly fucking stupid blizzard couldn't put it out before classic launch)
---
Yoo...
---
I don't really think there's much hope of it being totally fixed by launch at this point. It's an imperfect solution, but let's just pray it's actually temporary as they promised it would be. Even if we don't agree with it, I think most people at least understand the reasoning for having it in. It's not how classic is supposed to be and it's an annoyance, but one most people can deal with for a few weeks to a couple months until the launch hype evens out. If they leave it in for longer than that, it's a MAJOR problem.
---
Sharding
---
There is also a multiplicative decay on respawn rate the further up the zone is level wise. You aren't going to have to worry about people being able to mass farm Firewater's in Winterspring.
---
Wait did they put layering into Classic? 
---
So much for my interest then. I wanted to revisit an MMO, not a dead queuing lobby.
---
All of the streamers who are in cahoots are culpable. Esfand is a good guy, but he's playing with Tips last I heard, so his rep is tied to Tips' rep, which is terrible. And, Soda all but confirmed they want a blacklist for alleged stream sniping, for god's sake - which is using streamer status to abuse individuals blacklisted and of the community.
---
The fact that they'll be a resource black hole that will warp a server's ability to participate in PvE unless groups counteract that effect is a given.  
---
The fact that their very presence ruins the game by making entire chat channels unusable so finding groups is damn near impossible, has been proven by the beta.
---
But go ahead, keep the anti-jerk going, because I'm sure it's totally fine that one out of the *five* pvp servers is all but unplayable for folks who want to have a decent WoW experience. Let's just cede that ground because streamers are magical gods who deserve it.

Don't forget if you get archenite reaper recepy the you will be set on money for life
---
he also said there wouldn't be sharding.. well guess that was a lie.. he also said they would deliver an authentic experience. 50k people on a server with hundreds of shards sure is authetnic.  Core class mechanics that have been reported to be wrong since the blizzcon demo that are STILL not working weeks before launch. sure sounds authetnic.  
---
Ion knows how to talk, he used to be a lawyer..  pretending hes got the players best interest at heart, and would not tell them what they want to hear for them to buy into their product would be stupidity at best. Because once you're in and invested, they got you.
---
And why shouldnt the streamer be allowed to make a blacklist with his friends of all the stream snipers then? He is supposed to suffer because he is a streamer but he is not allowed to use his streamer status to defend him self? how does that make sense?
---
Yeah we gave them the recipe :p
---
God yes.
---
Which is why I'm glad I took people's suggestion to grab Skinning, and then selling all the leather.
---
It bankrolled four bags, weapon skills, secondary skills, and all class skills, with plenty silver to spare.

Let’s say it suddenly rained acid all over the world, constantly. The government decides to implement giant umbrellas, painted with massive Undertale Characters having sex on them, looking down at the citizens below.
---
Sure we recognize why it’s needed. That doesn’t make it any less stupid, they could have done it much better. But with classic just around the corner, they don’t have any time to fix their fuck-up.
---
umm what? Horde stomped you guys all through Westfall up to the Bridge.  We camped the bridge for a hot 30 minutes waiting for our second raid team to appear,  then we destroyed hogger and had a bunch of you mosquito like alliance follow up to redridge for easy pickens.  Don't sit there and bs behind your pc saying alliance won?  You're lying to yourself which is the best part.
---
they didn't have to tell you anything at all.
---
He didn't say this privately to a streamer, this was his response to a question during the media summit: [https://youtu.be/jYuUD0o-Nz8?t=233](https://youtu.be/jYuUD0o-Nz8?t=233)
---
Yes it does you know google goldenage definition it's right there
---
Quick - someone let Tips Out know so he can make a video telling us how good layering will be, and how it's actually better than Classic.
---
You know twitch isn’t a he, or a person, right?

I want to play priest. I've been a human priest for over 12 years. But I keep hearing that I have to play dwarf. I dont want to but I do want to raid. It's killing me.
---
Layering is going to ruin this whole endeavour and if you ever seriously defended it on this subreddit in the last couple months then I hope you're happy.
---
Nope, spanish will roll Shazzrah
---
People want to play the game, they want nothing to do with the company.
---
Imagine someone knits me an awesome sweater.  It's the most comfortable sweater ever.  They accidentally spill toxic waste on my sweater and ruin it.  They knit me the same comfortable sweater again and offer it to me.  Obviously I'm going to take it even though I'm a bit upset about the toxic waste.
---
when will people understand? :D
---
At 60, what do you do as a tank when not inside dungeons/raids? I assume you don’t have the damage to effectively farm mobs of any sort. Is it miserable trying to complete things in the over world now that you’re tank specced instead of leveling?
---
&gt;Faerlina is the unofficial Spanish server
---
As this other guy said. I have read this as well, seems its Herod or bust.
---
Which layer ?
---
Dude. I agree it’s dumb. But they aren’t holding out info. They are going to play on whatever server the majority of them can get their names.  Since character creation hasn’t started yet they don’t know where they are playing.   I’m sure everyone will know their server in the next day or two.
---
Multiple people can get Scarab Lord, just because some Horde gets it doesn't mean he can't.
---
As a middle aged guy with a wife and a kid and a full time job, I'll take layering over server queues anyday. After the week I took off for launch, I get, at max, 3 hours a day. I'll be damned if I'm going to spend 1/4 of that waiting to log in.
---
There's a reason this drama exists, you understand that, right?
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/SuspiciousGorgeousFiddleheadsWow
---
That is what people want nothing to do with. For very good reason.
---
It’s going to be gone in a few months and will prevent a shitty launch experience for everyone who is excited to get back into the game we all love. Go cry some more sperglord.
---
Yeah me neither. Not once did I get sharded the entire time I was playing.
---
Do I like sharing? No
---
But do I like 14,000 player queues? Also no
---
I dont know if you guys remember Tuesdays or especially patch days in vanilla but not being able to play until Wednesday afternoons wasn't that fun.
---
This was my reasoning too. (Horde though)
---
layingering is sharding, it works same as in BoA
---
Thought they were going Golemagg, well shit
---
Yeah mine was fine. No problems my end on BFA launch
---
if you are gonna go paladin i would recommend alliance
---
It may not be the #1 reason people leave, but it could easily be the #1 reason people don't stay. Vanilla has so many faults but players put up with them because of the general feel/charm it has, something that is quite hard to put into words but is easy to understand if you have felt it (yes even private servers) - I can promise you now that layering in its current form acts directly against that feel/charm in a huge way.
---
You don't own jack diddly fucking squat. If a streamer ( also a paying subscriber, human being etc just like you ) wants to roll on your snowflake server then you deal with it.
---
A streamer being on the same server as you is not going to ruin your experience, period. If it does then you should probably stay away from online games in general.
---
What is wrong with it? Why wouldn't a streamer put a short delay on their broadcast if they have such trouble with it?
---
Whitemane because she thiccc af.
---
You do have a choice. You wait until phase 2. Beggers can't be choosers.

I mean most of the people who jumped on the stress test aren’t playing it anymore. I think a lot of people also didn’t realize the stress test was going to extend over the weekend. I jumped in on Friday and didn’t realize it was up until I jumped on twitch this morning and watched someone playing.
---
I don't like that you are assuming that I support it. I never said it in that post, stop lying.
---
Spoken through the heart of Alabama.
---
But what about yes, y...yeah and YEAH! ?
---
MORE THAN ONCE, I HAVE DREAMED OF GIVING UP THE CROWN!
---
I just tried and it works btw!
---
Anyone who supports layering is a noob
---
And they announced it just after the Scandinavians choose Shazz...
---
I'm just gonna learn German and play on an EU server.
---
Probably not gonna be even close to that in a few weeks.
---
This has been the best answer so far.
---
To get data and feedback on how it works so launch won't be a complete disaster?
---
I doubt that, on retail wow if you take a name it stays yours for 30 days even after you delete the character or rename it iirc. i see no reason why it would be different on classic
---
This absolutely infuriates me.

You keep reposting the same comments, go troll somewhere else you sperglord.

But really at the exact same time

No prob
---
I’m not sure why you are defending sharding

Now that is a feature that changed the game forever, for better or for worse
---
60 Hunter, Shaman &amp; Mage. Raided on 2 of them every week. I was also in high school and got a 2.0 GPA because of it.
---
I've had such an easy time farming rare spawns for items that I'm gonna release a vid on how to do it JUST so Blizz nerfs layering.
---
I did make the mistake, but to be fair I was god damn wasted when I posted that comment lol
---
Ffs why
---
Fair enough i thought the only time he mentioned it was too esfand, anyhow i still feel it's an outdated statement on a system that was considered less concerning back then and needs clarifying.
---
RemindMe! 15 days “Install memoria”

If richturpin reads this DM me. I would love to do a remake of dual shadows
---
ye that's the wrong discord
---
Good news!
---
"Why don't people like us? We're not dumb!"
---
Dont want a streamer on your server? try and grab "thier" name before them with one of your 3 names,
---
we always had that and people dealt with it. and it's probably still going to happen. and is it even a problem?
---
theres a reason blizzard hasn't said anything regarding to how long it will last
---
hint: because its never going away.
---
warlock. mage is one of the most boring classes in the game and warlock has lots of cool stuff.
---
I was finally feeling good about choosing Shazzrah, but now based on what I hear of the Spanish community... I’m not so sure about Shazzrah anymore
---
If you've played retail in the last 5 years you'd know that this will never be fixed. Since they implemented this technology in WoD it has been like this. All of the problems with layering have been in the game in the form of sharding/phasing for 5 years. The only way this gets fixed is when they remove layering.
---
Phase 1 is Molten core (and ony). As a priest in Molten core, you do ALOT of displling both on bosses and trash. Your «best in slot» items are terrible for that. I would not recommend this list.
---
Roffle. I just want something that's not going to die
---
People get attached to their character names and even their server names. When servers merge, a not-insignificant number of players on the previous server(s) just unsub instead of playing on a new server or with a merged trade chat.
---
How are you filtering? I seem to only be able to sort by game version.
---
Yeah I think I'd rather be in the game with a population just waiting 2 - 3 x for a spawn versus breezing right through in an empty zone.     
---
If I make it to level 20 or 30 in mostly empty layers, I end up missing quite a bit. So by me just not playing or logging out and waiting creates the same effect.
---
&gt; Does anyone here, like me, support the action of Eric and Dylan at Columbine High?
---
That's what you said. Fucking disgusting.
---
There's a handful of married dads I work with that are in this boat and leaning west and PvE. I'll hit you up if we decide for sure on this.
---
Roger - fixed.
---
&gt;It also shocked me to see just how vibrant the community was, despite the hassles of installation.
---
What hassles were those?
---
I'd rather not spend all my energy hating on streamers and just enjoy the game for myself
---
any Russian who is not playing on Russian server will know english better than you expect
---
I hope this cancerous piece of shit and his ilk stay the fuck away from Herod.
---
I tried saying the same shit a few days ago, got upvotes at first then loads of downvotes. These "I hate streamers" folk are children, just like the obsessive stream-watchers they despise.
---
Int and Stam is just as good for leveling, if not better for priests. You spec shadow, put points into spirit tap and you will get that sweet zero downtime with enough hp to make bigger pulls and come out on top through world pvp encounters
---
It wasnt the LFG it was the fact they put you with other servers.
---
If it was only the LFG there wouldn't have been an issue since you would have still be on the island with the same people
---
I'm calling the FBI.  I forget thought where does that eventually lead? The boats to northrend?
---
Appreciate it, thank you!
---
Fucking hell. Taking shilling to the next level. Using class abilities and potions to validate layering lmao.
---
How many skills and professions can I have?
---
We want classic right?
---
They should release the game how it was originally. 
---
I for one like the feeling of having so many people around you jumping and fighting for mobs. Hello MMO stands for Massively Multiplayer Online.
---
 I want to see people I want to compete against other people.
---
I want to feel better than everyone and be able to show it by getting level 5 when everyone else is level 3. 
---
Showing off my first blue in west fall to all the unfortunate.
---
I don't really understand the logic and shit behind layering. From my pserver experience its only aids for the first couple levels once you actually are out of the starting zones people have to start running which limits the amount of people killing mobs. 
---
IDK, I wish layering wasn't a thing but I know it will be because Blizzard already worked this hard they aren't going to trash the whole thing 2 weeks out.
---
You can dislike and avoid streamers without actually being an imbecile.  I’m capable of doing it. I’m sure you can too.
---
Yea, we should burn him at the stake! wait...
---
I wouldn't call myself a "Blizzard Apologist" as much as a realist. I have accepted that Layering is going nowhere and I need to embrace it and let it server me the best way possible.
---
I'm also an optimist. I have faith that Blizzard will do their best, within reason, to get layering in a more acceptable place come launch. It has come a long way since it's original inception. There are not many bugs laying around right now, so this gives them a primary focus.
---
While you should play what you want, you still do have time to experiment.
---
Play Dwarf for a few hours/days on some server or even retail and see if being a Dwarf bothers you.
---
I was a Human-only-player too, Then I rolled a Dwarf for no real reason. After level 20 I was already used to it and didn't mind being Short-Human.
---
They will have to communicate in English anyway. There are only two English PvP-servers, so there will be enough people who will not tolerate people speaking Spanish in the public channels. Thanks to Blizzard's automatic report system anyone who uses any language other than English will quickly be muted.
---
Remindme! 19 hours memoria

From the US originally but live in Korea and still play on NA realms. My ping on OCE was 250ms+ while being 150 for PST and between 175-200 on EST. Not awful but I opted to not play on OCE as I continued on my same characters.

The time zone differences between KST and US are great for when you want to avoid players (farming mats, rares, etc) but can suck for when you need help (raiding, group quests). KST is 13-14 hours ahead of EST, 16-17 hours ahead of PST.
---
I'm actually at a loss for servers for Classic. I want to raid at least casually so I thought about just heading to OCE realms but I was looking forward to playing on an RPPVP realm.
---
Yeah the whole point in classic is competing for mobs and it often forced people to group. For me that’s how I met a lot of people and formed a community. Layering would ruin that major aspect of classic, but I have a feeling they will leave it in. Hopefully it doesn’t end up making everything a ghost town single player game like retail
---
Yeah, it does, because he was saying there's nothing anybody can do about it. There's plenty other people can do about it to make streamers reconsider. Should they do that? I don't know. I don't really care. I am going to play on a Pacific server to avoid them, so the problem to me is solved.
---
I don't disagree with the social aspect of the  game being negatively impacted by dungeon queue but I can also say unequivocally that I wouldn't still be playing WoW if it weren't for QoL upgrades like the queue.  You take the good with the bad.
---
If you say so
---
I can't decide if I should play warrior or mage. I just can't.
---
Well if these problems pile up I\`d rather pay a sub to a private server than retail. But most private servers will die when classic is released so there goes that.
---
*laughs in shitty australian internet*
---
100ms would be like a dream to me. I routinely get 500+
---
If Layering is a whole seperate world why do you change layers when entering a city? ...
---
Details damage meter, atlas lootclassic, dominos, bronze dragon frame, ecasting bar, lib classic mob health, mapster, move anything, neat plates, omni cc, questie classic, simple unit frames, vendor price, weak auras V2 for classic and weapon swing timer.   
---
I have all of these and got them set up with my macros and controls. Upon launch all you have to do is go into the WTF folder and change the realm name/character name and the profiles will swap over to your new character.
---
No its not the same
---
Gonna jump into some eso with the gf till its out
---
Yep, any 2 of the main professions. People usually pair one gathering profession and one production (i.e., mining &amp; blacksmithing), but you can do 2 gathering (such as mining and skining) or 2 production (like blacksmithing and engineering) if you want.
---
&gt;my English is fairly well
---
"Well" is an adverb, so it can only be used to describe a verb.
---
E.g. "I **speak** English well."
---
There is a homonym which means someone who is not sick ("How's James?" "He's well"), but that wouldn't work here.
---
Since you were describing your English (a noun), you ought've used an adjective like "good."
---
Sorry if I sound condescending. I teach English and correcting people is my irritating habit.
---
Mankrik for the best server name and for being the only Normal realm that won't be crazy Alliance-heavy.
---
Also because it will have the best Barrens chat.

Funny how he assumed that no big group of people will roll just to fuck with him and they won't care about being blacklisted because they will the top guild on the server themselves.
---
I dont know about hype, people seem pretty pessimistic around here.
---
I certainly hope the layering bugs are fixed for launch.
---
"Easily fixed"
---
Swish and flick.
---
Yeah, my parents would never have paid for a subscription based game lol. I imagine Vanilla average age was higher than expected. When we got to Wrath I bet the average age was a bit lower (as using cards online to buy stuff had gotten a LOT more popular by then).

Yeah don't use that shit for classic, it said I had updates available for some of my addons and it recked them to retail addons
---
I refuse to be insulted by a nation that lost *two* wars to giant chickens.
---
HAHAHAHAHAA
---
Bet you feel stupid now. Continents are not layered. The entire game is just sharded
---
Honestly, you can collect the most expensive and rare patterns and then you make the maddest, craziest, fucking bank ever.
---
My SO was one of only a handful of Armoursmiths on our server back in Classic, he even had the opposing faction signing up to use his services.
---
ZT Will be victorious!
---
Phase 1 is 6 MONTHS and it's basically sharding not even the layering we were promised.

Things are getting spicy. Seems like the community is divided? My Spanish abilities only stretch to Google Translate, so if anyone has more info on whats going on, that would be nice
---
I’m totally in. 33 with two kids and a heavy job. Interested in Horde PVP if we can. Don’t care what time one.
---
I never said anyone was "wrong", we were just talking about streamers trying to avoid streamsnipers and that the Alliance streamers seem to have less to fear than the Horde streamers.
---
If you can't see or interact with the other servers in any way, why does this matter at all? I can't see how it could be abused any more than using [battle.net](https://battle.net) chat.
---
I don\`t get why you want layering. Private servers did just fine with 12k players in starting zones.  If queues are too big just open another realm. It takes them no more than 1 hour. I don\`t think opening a realm is expensive for blizzard. If you think that the server may die think about it. Let\`s say from 12k max half will leave, 6k i still more than enough for a healthy server.
---
no is that a dependency?
---
Layering is bad simply because when i get layered, i cannot see that other players are near me which gives me illusion of being on a dead server which is the worst kind of World of Warcraft.
---
Server Community =/= Streamer Community
---
*their nation's WoW community
---
Fair enough. They wouldn't be as cool, and I can see both sides of the coin tbh. I like them personally, but its nice to see everyones opinion.
---
I got it from wowinterface! Hmmm I must be missing something obvious.
---
This needs to be known - people confuse the Dungeon Finder with the cross-realm capabilities that were implemented afterwards (though it was quite shortly afterwards, so it’s understandable why people would lump it in with LFG).
---
/agree
---
Ackthually.. there are still use cases for bear metal. Also, good host hardware will run better with heavy virtual servers.
---
It will settle down after a few days. Trade chat isn't needed in the beginning anyway while people are leveling!
---
Yes. It's awful when no one speaks English and the 'community' is segmented into little cliques of individual nationalities. It's why I'm considering rolling on American servers despite the ping and time zone issue.
---
That was my thought too!
---
I am sure it won't be my last time either.
---
In terms of YouTube content there is many big/well known Ironman series (mrmammal, boaty, ricecup, devious, Alkan) - in terms of pvp or pve content torvesta, skillspecs, sparcmac, ronplaysgames, zulu, woox. There’s a ton of bigger names in runescape.
---
There's always gonna be someone else who rolled dwarf just for fear ward. Don't worry about it. Go human.
---
If I’m rolling on an RP-PVP server why would anyone on the opposite faction not be kill on site? That’s ridiculous.
---
We will join then demand a better server or else we will leave.
---
They never said Golemagg, people just started pushing memes about golemagg being spanish. I assume its becuase they are going shazzrah and wants to influence people to go there aswell ... ( and hope that spanish did go golemagg)
---
RemindMe! 15 days "memoria"
---
Mine only worked if I targeted myself with hots or something. On other players and mobs it didn't work

---
by being in "anti-streamer group" you are actually in a streamer group, just as a heel
---
Any former Thunderhorn going Shazzrah?
---
Look how they massaced my boy!
---
Where did I say I was interested in playing for free?  I responded to another one of these comments above.  I said I'd pay for a Classic experience.  I still would.  The money is not an issue, but what it says about Blizzard's priorities, and principles, is.
---
Hm interesting that both Scandinavians and Spanish people will play on Shazzrah. The population difference seems to increase between Shazzrah and Golemagg (at least according to the surveys)
---
It would be lame if they would need to split a server in two after they remove layering. I would rather start with more servers and merge IMO.
---
I couldn't think of any names that would be an example so I turned to blizzard lol. The link below should explain what they mean. And blizzard doesn't really patrol for these. It's more like your name is noticed by someone and they don't like it so they report it. 
---

---

---
Idk.. they are ugly imo. Won't miss em.
---
Then tell us, how is sharding and layering CURRENTLY different? The way Blizz describes layering it should be different and is more so akin to miniservers. Instead it’s current form is copy and pasted sharding which has the current issues it has.
---
Yeah...no.
---
They're going to be sniped all day long no matter where they roll. Anti-streamer players have 0 leverage. Asmongold doesn't care if you roll on his server and gank him because 1 more ganker when he already has hundreds in his chat trying to kill him makes no difference. An anti-streamer player does however not want the fanbase on their server.
---
Two words: Onyxia buff
---
Does everyone not realize that layering isn't staying for long after launch?
---
Blizzard said Layering is for sure not staying after Phase 1.
---
I understand why people dislike it but to act like it's here forever is a bit much.
---
You think you do but you dont
---
&gt;He is overreacting because he has to put on a show for his viewers.
---
One of the most succesful streamers on Twitch is Shroud. He doesn't scream into his mic, ever. "Saturating my mic is content guys lol im not really a huge sperglord im only pretending for C O N T E N T". I don't buy it. You don't need to be an annoying little shit to be popular on twitch.
---
I’m still very slowly working on getting the two new reps up so I can have flying in BFA.  I know I’ll never level alts until I have it and if the next expansion is actually, by some miracle, good I’ll want them.
---
All gathering skills can be learned at lvl 1. Production skills are all lvl 5 required.
---
This is true for a lot of people it seems. Ive seen stipulation saying "since they were in vanilla, but taken out before this current classics patch they shouldn't be added back", and am torn between keeping them in some legacy vault mindset, or adding them. Either way Ill be happy since classics launch is coming up, but it cant hurt to just see what people think.
---
Same. Or at least make layering literally 1 week max and/or limited to starting zones only (sharding) after the first week. No layering/sharding anywhere else in the game after the first week.
---
Then you get a smooth launch and we get our in game community.
---
the amount of people telling him to stay off herod is probably gonna make him roll there tbh. I just wanna avoid him too, but announcing a streamer free server seems kinda counter productive when you're dealing with someone like asmon who will openly admit he wants to fuck up a server for his benefit.
---
Yeah, I took 4 days off (Tues-Fri) and I get Monday off because of Labor Day. I have nooo delusions about hitting 60 before I have to go back to work. I think on the survey I put 1-2 months to get to 60, just to be as realistic for my time as possible.
---
RIP despacito server
---
Noted. o7
---
Am I though? I don't think a 4 hour time difference and a slightly higher but still manageable ping is that big of a deal if I can avoid a server where tons of people refuse to speak English and are split off into their nationality cliques.
---

10'000 bytes. That's alot of traffic

&gt;After that you could travel to a more remote area for quests.  
---
Queue 500 people trying to each collect 10 gold dust and candles from the Fargodeep mine.  GL getting the tag on Goldtooth in the first day.  
---
I think sharding should exist based on the number of people in that particular zone.  For instance:  
---
if # of players within Elwynn, but outside of Northshire Abbey, is greater than 500, then split into two groups.  If one of those groups becomes greater than 500, then split into 2 more groups.  
---
If at any point 2 shards contain less than 200 players each, merge the groups.  
---
This way there won't be any 'dead' shards and it'll still feel very populated.  
---
Then remove shards outside of Elwynn/Durotar/Tirisfall/Dun Morogh etc.
---
You're not wrong.

I prefer the primal look (especially with classic around the corner), but youre right to some extent. They aren't ALL that.
---
That I don't know hopefully its a bug.
---
I thought stress test was over ?
---
Isn't Golemagg the spanish server according to the data from the polls?
---
According to the Spanish people choosing Shazzrah, there is another big group of Spanish players as well who will be going to Golemagg. So not surprisingly when we have only 2 server options, there will be a bit of both on both servers..
---
Riding this to save on squinting. Preferably someone with a cool voice too! Like MORGAN FREEMAN
---
why do people think layering is gonna make launch any more bearable? you're still gonna be fighting over mobs with 500 other people day 1 lol.
---
You said Can both times, I assume one was supposed to be a can't?
---
I'm not rolling pvp but I understand people not wanting to get caught up in other peoples shit
---
Basically. It's pretty situational but I think it's worth doing. Mages can Blink out of your Cheap Shot and Garrote doesn't silence them in Classic, so Ambush is really your only option for an opener.
---
This is one streamer saying it. Unless there's a streamer coalition that staysafe is the spokesperson of, which I doubt. Also it's impossible to derive context from clips. You could clip a ton of stuff from any of the classic streamers' and portray them in a bad light, because context is lost.
---
Terrible
---
As much as it is a meme, Melee-weaving is also a straight DPS up, so do that, too.
---
figuring out which class to play..
---
Rogue? Hunter? Warlock? 
---
aaaaahhhhhh
---
Fairbanks because it won't be overpopulated like Whitemane, and because the streamers all agreed not to play on Fairbanks.
---
10 days is a common figure for people who know how to level in vanilla wow. 
---
To clarify that’s 10 days of game time. Not 10 actual days.
---
Mainly because they're not fun to level untwinked, and they aren't very good at solo PvP.
---
Mods, this needs to be here, do not delete

You’re telling me. I’m stuck between a priest of rogue.

Yeah. I get that you aren’t shitting on the guy. 
---
I agree. It’s so silly to pretend that sitting by a campfire for a few hours is more fulfilling than months of 40 man raiding with a solid team.
---
The other side of that coin is that now that Blizzard is profiting off vanilla again, they're going to be more litigious towards private servers :(
---
Disappointing... Just gonna reserve names on both PVP servers and go for the server with the bigger percentage of English speakers.
---
Is it read in a stupid computery voice? Seems a bit immersion breaking
---
I took two weeks off and I’ll get 60 before that’s over probably. Aiming for 7-8 days played haha.

Ooooo. That is a pretty great idea.
---
You don't understand sarcasm and talk about him having zero life skills
---
Not mad man - have seen a few of your other comments and can see you are very for layering so probably not worth discussing and not trying to start a debate to be honest, but:-
---
I get the need for layering, I actually design and implement distributed infrastructure/services at scale as my day job so believe me when I say I fully understand the need. I get that Blizzard is a company, they want to make money and their decisions are based on metrics/data that we simply don't have access too, they know more than us. I get that there are loads of people dramatizing the solution and that only the bad results are being upvoted. I get there is nothing we can do about it now, there isn't enough time and I don't think anyone really has a decent solution anyway. 
---
But what I also get is the feeling that playing the beta the past few months has given me, the feeling that hits my stomach every time someone gets layered infront of me, the feeling I have never once had on any private server in years of playing them, the same feeling I get when I see someone from another realm on retail walk past me, the same feeling I get when something titanforges 20 levels higher than it should be. To be honest, I don't know what exactly the feeling is but I know it makes me want to stop playing and I know it prevent a lot of players from experiencing the same game I have been lucky enough to experience.
---
&gt; Blizzard has made it pretty clear that they agree having that many people all in one place is not conducive to how Vanilla was meant to be played. It breaks the game design.
---
If they think Layering is better than overpopulation, they have no idea what made Vanilla great.  These are not the people that made vanilla.  They made retail.  The whole reason people demanded this game is because retail was so much different from vanilla.
---
&gt;Contrary to what the vocal minority here would seem to imply
---
Except on the master thread of Layering, anti-layering posts were upvoted significantly higher than pro-layering posts.
---
&gt;. The stress test isn't necessarily indicative of how layering will function on live realms
---
So it's denial then?  I'm not saying you're wrong here, and hope you are right, but *literally all the evidence* points to Layering being shit.
---
&gt;And the majority of people playing the game won't be effected by it or care
---
Except they will, and they will.  The effects of layering are pretty subtle and nefarious 99% of the time.  Not running into the same people as much. A little immersion breaking here and there.  A few annoying glitches now and then.  A bit of abuse.  But they add up.  And while I love vanilla WoW, it's far from a perfect game, so if you add up all those little things on top of it, you're going to have people quitting that normally wouldn't, and it could very well make the experience less enjoyable for those who stick with it.

I doubt more people will show up to a less than 1 day stress test that is open then to the game itself.
---
Calling people that do that a loser was probably a little harsh. That being said, I don't think it makes a difference what age you are. Being young just means you have a little bit better of an excuse.
---
I cannot understand blizzard logic , why cant they just add layering in the first 2 zones ? this is going to destroy one of the best classic aspect COMMUNITY , layering feels so unnatural
---
This is true but the act breaks other laws in all 50 states.
---
Good point. Although, I’m so burned out on grinding reps. I don’t think I’ll get the new two to exalted.
---
Imagine taking blacklist threats seriously
---
I’ve been horde since mid TBC, just going for a change :)
---
Yep, confirmed that layering will break the game. We will no longer be playing on a consistent world, we will be playing on a shattered world where people constantly spam "INVITE TO blabla LAYER" or people who are farming professions asking for an invite so they get put on another layer and can restart their grind route without any downtime. This means economy will be broken, and an MMO with a broken economy is an MMO that is not going to function
---
Disappointing... Just gonna reserve names on both PVP servers and go for the server with the bigger percentage of English speakers when all the communities have decided by 27th August.
---

---
This thread confirms that the Asmongold haters are just immune to sarcasm, holy fuck. How can people be so dense

You'll probably get there. With real life responsibilities and stuff like that, there's no way I'll get there in the time I took off. Sadly Tuesday the next week is End of Month for me, so I HAVE to be at work, and I only get 2 weeks a year (finally got my 2nd week this year), so I gotta save the rest...just in case.
---
Ooga gang strikes again
---
How can you say "sharding is ruining vanilla" if the game isn't out yet? Come back in a few weeks.
---
There are some niche 2h fury specs, that are ok for awhile, but if you want to be competetive in pve you will eventually need to go dual wield fury.  
---
Army with a 2h remains the best spec for pvp.
---
To be honest, yes. It’s worth it for me but you pick between Microsoft’s synthesized voices. Apparently there are companies that sell more realistic ones that are comparable but it’s not worth looking into for me personally.
---
Don't play in phase 1.
---
Too bad they didn't release reforged before Classic, seems like a missed opportunity.
---
You don\`t need layering, private servers proved it.
---
What a terribly weird analogy lol.
---
The whole "phase 1" thing is really badly worded. They didn't say layering would definitely last the entirety of phase 1, they said it would be "removed by phase 2".
---
Meaning, that it could be removed / disabled at any point prior to phase 2.
---
I've experienced 4 different pserver launches of different sizes, and every single time, about 2 or 3 weeks into the server launch, the population was spread out enough that things weren't insane in lower level zones. So I honestly don't see layering lasting more than 4 weeks, tbh.
---
How many gigs is the classic? I'm assuming it'll be smaller than the current 15 years worth of content one?
---
You're somewhat right about the first part, not the second. Big streamers on your server can absolutely ruin your experience, unless your intended experience is 100% built on uphill pvp battles against hordes of fanboys surrounding their streamer. That's just one example of how it could play out if on a streamer server, the possibilities are quite endless.
---
No one seems to know what actual numbers of players will look like so hard to say for sure.
---
I was leveling in Mulgore, and my hunter was almost continually buffed with thorns/wild. Seemed every passing druid would slap one on me as he ran by.
---
Well, this ability is called thinking. You can develop it too, but it's not that easy.
---
Except in this situation the temporary fucks the long term over.
---
With just 2 PvP servers there'll have to be some heavy layering to address population density, specially in leveling areas, and that doesn't sit well with many people.
---
So you'll have people coming back to the game, sitting in queues, finally getting into their server, get triggered by layering issues, and not feel like resubbing, leading to reduced population justifying only having 2 servers.
---
It's a self-fulfilling prophecy that only Blizzard benefits from, by getting a temporary spike in subs, some of which may also check out BFA. They're clearly playing for the short term here.
---
History repeating it self.. they did the same thing in vanilla 15 years ago, before they had spanish servers and was so toxic and refused to talk english.

BOP and requires blacksmithing.
---
I checked the files everything is in there in the Libs folder.
---
8000k people on a server with later phase releases has less of an impact of play than even 5000k when everyone is leveling. 
---
At that time resources would be the largest contested issue. (Which they could fix via other options).

Navak here. Thanks man. I've been working on the guide continuously since Nov 2017, taking only a couple shorts breaks in 2019 to help start up CWL + stream the Classic Beta ([twitch.tv/navashed](https://twitch.tv/navashed)). Egregious ([twitch.tv/egregious](https://www.twitch.tv/egregious)) has helped me throughout the process from the beginning, the very day Classic was announced at Blizzcon 2017. Our vision for the interactive tool was brought to life by the programming expertise of master Ayle ([twitch.tv/aylegaming](https://twitch.tv/aylegaming)).
---
Your name is very on-brand mr edgy lad
---
so, in fact players (friends, guilds) cannot play on one layer without require everyone to relog. And that may happen after a disconnect due to power or internet trip of one player.
---
And what about other two problems?
---
These all new problems outweights the single benefit of being slightly more static
---
You sound like you were sucking on your moms titty back in 2004
---
Its called a bug, not sure if you ever heard of it. There were many people who played and hadn't any problems. If you play on the 27th and this stuff still happens then you can start flaming

swe?

WrathDimm if you actually still believe Layering is just for launch, you must be the most gullible person on the planet, do you still believe in Santa and the Easter bunny too?

---
Yeah that's bullshit, Layering is here to stay, forever
---
ah fuck it I'll just go rogue

&gt;Their goal is to just kill the streamer, then they won't care if they themselves die in the process too.

Vindication is recruiting. We are a 1 day / week horde raiding guild in North America who have core members that have played together since Vanilla. With significant experience in raid leadership, both in vanilla and retail, we focus on getting the most done in a short amount of time.
---
We will be focusing on leveling up as quickly as possible and jumping into dungeons for pre-raid gear and transition to MC and Onyxia as soon as possible and beyond. Our class officers are encouraged to look out for their own and they will be there to support you, not dictate you. We know that we will have veterans and new players to classic and all are welcome who are willing to learn and put their best foot and attitude forward in every raid. We also have strong PVPers that will be focusing on ranking on non-raid days.
---
Loot
---
We bring a dynamic loot system with the use of lootlist that gives all members with good attendance equal access to attaining gear without the trouble of dkp banking and the bias of loot council.
---
Raid Days:
---
SUNDAY 8pm-12mid, est
---
PVP EST Server: Herod
---
Discord Contacts: Abatu#9180 ThatGuyTace#4354 Gorgrath#7230
---
Discord Server: https://discord.gg/hhAzPYZ
---
Our Discord is where everything is currently located, from our guild app, our roster, to all of our prep work. We do not use a website, instead we make extensive use of Google Drive, with various spreadsheets, docs, and forms. We look forward to hearing from you.
---
Ok, trying to reserve tomorrow guess I'll have to hold for more info
---
So glad I'm playing on Bloodsail when the game comes out.
---
Glad you read the post.
---
It also doesn't have the best options listed for each class either - No Ironfoe or Thunderfury e.g and 0 options means you'll just have discussion whenever the site's posted.
---
I much prefer your spreadsheet, thanks a lot. Classes like Tanks + Healers aren't so black and white when it comes to gearing as you can't really Sim how much mana or defense you *truly* need, it's more a thing you balance with your Raid.
---
Well, if you want to learn the Spanish language then go roll on that server. I don't want an English realm to be flooded by non English speakers. I still blame Blizzard for this though, this is totally not our fault.
---
Joking on the surface for sure, but you know that there's a genuine powertrip behind it.
---
Ret is a PVP spec and soloing pve.
---
Prot is for 5 mans
---
Healing is for end game raids and 5 mans.
---
^^this^^
---
Spanish have declared for pyrewood, so I’m rolling mirage as they tend to not speak English.
---
I'd like this as well
---
In retail I have a character named kuntwithak.
---
During my leveling processes I had someone stop mid dungeon to tell me how immature I was and report me before they left.
---
I still have the character with its name to this day
---
The problem is that this bug has existed through ALL test. It also exists in the primary system that Layering is based off of. Telling people not to bother until it hits live is idiotic because that’s how bugs hit live.
---
[Lol.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cmj4n4/please_be_toxic/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---
if you have two folders in your interface folder called "classicauradurations" and "libclassicdurations" then I can't really help you more. All I did was download both and the timers work fine.
---
Then he will get corpse camped the fuck out until he decides to roll on another server.
---
Herod is literally looking to be our only hope left at a solid PvP server for us at the East Coast.
---
Judging from the posts here and the forums, the majority of Herod's players is doing their very best to keep these fucks at bay off of Herod.
---
The more we speak about it, the more we grow to be an anti-streamer server. Now should they decide to roll there, there will be an army waiting for them to make their experience miserable. People are already coordinating Alliance and Horde to give up coords of streamers and will just corpse camp the shit out of them until they leave.
---
They where going golemagg right?
---
Well that explains your faith in Blizzard- you quit when things were just starting to get bad.  If you'd seen what retail is now you'd have zero faith in them, nor would you trust the mechanic to be "temporary".  Also, what's temporary?  Months?  Years?  Give a break.
---
I don't think you have the slightest clue what makes Vanilla good, period.
---
How are you saying I'm more obsessive than you when we are literally both commenting on it?  Are you daft?
---
Who cares about stats, esp at such a low level? It’s a solid 6 dps higher than Smite’s Mighty Hammer. 1 dps is 14 attack power. 7 strength gives those 14. 
---
Smite’s Mighty Hammer already has 11 str, so for the sake of isolated comparison, keep that in mind. Also we’ll round out the numbers, this gives SMH a dps of 20 (19,7 rounded up) and Verigan’s at 26 (25,6 rounded up). Those 6 dps equals 96 AP - or 48 strength. Minus 11 on SMH and we get 37 str. 
---
So in an isolated comparison between those two, Verigan’s Fist has an ‘invisible’ +37 Strength.
---
Well, I'll answer when I'll figure how to pronounce at least one of them.
---
I’m self employed so having known sometime summer 2019 I’d need time off it’s been expected/planned for over a year. No practice runs just brute force playtime and doordash!
---
I got gifted a month of Origin Access Premier a while ago. Just used it to play Madden 20 until classic launch
---
I don’t know why people are bashing you for this comment. You point is very clear and logical. The “Layering” is just re-skinned sharding. 
---
Sharding/layering is detrimental to the game and that’s the end of it. It’s not needed in the game and it’s not wanted by the core of the community. Layering takes away from a Vanilla experience. Which is what we all wanted in the first place. We wanted the original version of the game. Layering was not in the original version of the game........
---
9am
---
can I join.
---
I remember the first time I saw that dome in Vanilla...I assumed my video card just couldn't handle the game and it ws failing to load something.
---
almost half a second after it happens kek
---
Not saying it's a bad thing to have, but I wouldn't plan your economy over it.
---
forgot where here bitch ass was
---
R-word LMFAOOO are you 4 years old?
---
Didn’t even think of that lol if Warcraft 3 remastered came out, I’d be playing the shit out of it and getting more hyped for classic. Fuck that would have been awesome.
---
Same
---
Blizzard is fucking stupid and can’t do anything right.
---
Well, I think current solution introduces the least amount of new entities.
---
It allow smooth play with friends (while there is some videos showing group players layered out, that is not a system problem, that is an implementation bug)
---
Transitions outside of group invites should be quite rare and happen only on layer split and merge. While this happens often on a stress test (thats its point), it should happen a lot less often on live (again, if that's not true that is an implementation bug)
---
Layer abuse require friends that are ready to invite you. Maybe a system with additional requirement "that friend should be reasonably close (e.g. same zone)" will be better, but that's another vector of possible bugs.
---
Stress tests and betas are really not-blizzlike in terms of population numbers, and the system is being tested so it is tuned more aggressively, I hope that will be a lot more static on live, but that's in Blizzard's hands
---
Overall, the system is okay-ish and better than alternatives, however the implementation and configuration (tuning) may screw things up. And that is true for all systems.
---
On that note on there being plenty of EST friendly guilds on PST, mine will be one of them.  Here's our recruitment post on the Whitemane subreddit:  https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassicWhitemane/comments/co6eb0/guild_finder_thread/ewmtdha/
---
I expect Blizzard adjusted layering during the stress test to test its functionality. You know, like they said they were doing
---
&gt;The only thing I really want to call out on layering is a lot of people were wondering if the population thresholds in the beta were accurate, and they're not. There were some people who said, 'Did they just turn this on to test it functionally to make sure it worked?' That's accurate. We set the thresholds much lower on the beta than we would for live because we wanted to make sure we were actually testing the feature. There were other things people pointed out as bugs we were not expecting.

---
Streamers and their fans/guildmates
---
A notice: it was leading to their guild housing instance very early in development. You can find old videos that confirms it.
---
Inaccurate, not upside down
---
I still don’t think attrition rates are going to be greater than 40-50%. 
---
The second I knew we’d have an issue with layering was when I saw how few servers they put out there. The PVP realms are going to be packed to the brim and layering will never be able to be turned off.
---
I’m fine with layering being a temporary thing, but this does not look like a temporary thing.....
---
My man! Was feeling left out as well. Catch you on Arugal!
---
They're doing everything they can!
---
Stability, maybe, not always.
---
Security? Not really. There have already been news about data leaking between applications hosted on aws for example.
---
They said layering is only for release so hopefully it’s gone after the choke point starts are done.
---
Why not both?
---
I think meaningless is wrong. I was in a guild that was borderline US top 100 in BC to Wrath. We had many "server" firsts which felt good to us, but we watched the strats of the top guilds getting world firsts sometimes weeks or a month or more before us. They did the real heavy lifting and we took the strats they came up with. Everyone knows the strats here, knows the class composition, gear requirements, etc...
---
These are not world firsts or world classic firsts, they are just server firsts. These are like Blizzard opening up new servers and not allowing transfers to it. 
---
It is worth acknowledging the time commitment and ability to execute a strategy, but it doesn't deserve a world first designation. These bosses have been defeated world first under the same classes and skills.
---
no, they are not. they want classic to fail.
---
I hope blizzard does this. It would end the entire streamer debate. Players who want to be with streamers know what server to go to and everyone else knows to stay away from that one server.
---
Your immersion is only broken because you want it to be.  You have *no way to tell* if someone on the other faction vanishes, if it has to do with them entering a BG, ALT-F4ing, lagging out, or going to a different layer.  You're a liar if you say it still does.
---
Biggest load of shit ever
---
Im aware, im not even talking about any of this. I agree with everything you just said, im talking about people declaring OWNERSHIP of a server. Streamers have not done that, but people HAVE declared Herod as the non-streamer server and have told streamers they are not welcome there.
---
Yes, but that doesn't make the claim that every byte transmitted becomes 10,000 bytes less wrong. Every byte transmitted from a client becomes 100 bytes because it must be replicated to 100 other clients.
---
Don't really see the point in writing SUCH a long thread for something like that, yet I do see a very valid point, that being: Classic. We're all hyped up.
---
I feel like this subreddit has been playing Classic for the past few months already by creating tons and tons of funny, nostalgic, helpful and theorycrafting threads and I love it.
---
Everyone just wants to start playing and since they can't yet (to full extent), they've set their hearth to /r ClassicWoW and come back here every once in a while to listen to how other players will enjoy the game once it's up.
---
The Classic community really is a unique one, and in a good way. The best way.
---
I don't know how they will perserve and all that, but all the addon setting is saved in your folders.
---
Go under wow, find _classic_ -&gt; WTF -&gt; Account -&gt; the one with some random numbers -&gt; [The server your character was on in stress test] -&gt; and then copy the folder with your char name. You can rename it to whatever your char name is gonna be on launch. Now I don't know if it will follow the exact same file route, but it probably will, so just create a folder with the server name you are joining, and add your character folder and it should all save over. Alternatively you can wait until the game comes out with the folder copied, then locate your folder and replace it while you are in-game, only takes a couple seconds and restart game.
---
If that means that they announce what server they gonna be on then I don't see much of an issue here.
---
Esfand specifically really does.
---
Well duh.  It was clearly hyperbole.
---
&gt; The world being dangerous, cruel, and unforgiving is what MAKES it immersive to people who want that kind of realm, not you and your friends RP-ing characters LARPing in-game.
---
Which raises the question, if all people want is a dangerous world, why not stick to a PvP realm? Why do people who just want to focus on the PvP side roll on an RP realm that happens to have PvP enabled at all times? RP realms used to be pretty explicitly be for people 'LARPing' in the open world, and in the case of RPPvP realms we used PvP mechanics to facilitate and enhance that. 
---
I'm not trying to be combative, I'm just curious. I feel we have very different perspectives on this, and I want to better understand the mentality behind this response. But I do feel you have this idea in your head that we want to bubble ourselves up and pretend nothing else is going on and that we'd rather ignore enemy players. 
---
Really, we prefer not to and try to incorporate them into our roleplay even if they attack us. We can't incorporate attacking players into our roleplay if they keep coming back over and over, whether killing us or being killed. At that point it isn't RPPvP, it's just normal PvP, since in universe a character can't be killed fifty times in a row and run back to their body as a ghost.
---
Which isnt how much you’ll be making in Classic. Its only that high due to level cap
---
were fucked
---
Layers arent just to make leveling easier they also help with server load.
---
Classic without Drama is not classic?
---
Remulos, because it’s the only PVE Oceanic server
---
yes, do you want a date?
---
Woah, I see, thanks for your response!
---
I really hope some of the FFXIV mindset about DPS vs utility will bleed back over into classic. There’s a concept there of how selfish a DPS job is. So like black mage and samurai do the most damage, but they bring almost no raid utility. They’re valued for their power, but other jobs are just as valued for their buffs and debuffs and ability to rez, and the jobs are balanced around that trade off.
---
This will end terrible.
---
We should be grateful yes, we are trying to avoid them so the fact that they went out of their way to help us do that. We are the ones making demands and they made a concession.
---
No it's a console configuration command
---
Engi is terrible for gold making. But it's amazing as a perk because it gives you all kinds of useful stuff for pvp and pve that only engineers can use. Mining is great though, especially if can find a healer in phase 2 then you can 2man DME and make loads of money.
---
This is almost a certainty regardless if/when they pick a server.  They might as well just pick one and try to grab it.
---
Golemagg post was a fake of a very few people
---
And we keep English in public chats like general, trade etc
---
with the quantity of server we have , do you really thing layering is going away?
---
I really don’t get it. This is 100% streamer priveledge. 
---
The “no changes” chanting streamers now want to be able to reserve names. That’s a real vanilla experience.
---
the horde one was added in later expansion. Just was never completed while the ally one was. A bit of a shame really.
---
Mafias like this won't exist in classic if Blizz enforces their TOS.  Cross faction collusion is against the rules.
---
Not at max level, hence why they changed it. Groups just zerged Scholo and Strat as 10 all day, didn't need the XP anyway.
---
Lmfao because they said that’s not how it’s supposed to work.
---

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cp38rh/addon_which_automatically_takes_a_screenshot_when/). 
---
It is an amazing idea.  Multiboxxers have been doing it for years.  It works beautifully.  Don't want someone on a sever, report them with enough accounts and it is automatic suspension time for that person.
---
Fuck off.

---
The big Spanish group already announced that they intend to use English in general chat, and create a separate channel for Spanish. They want to avoid what happened in Spinebreaker, so let's stop trying to segregate communities before the game even launches.
---
How would the damage be done to such an extent? There are plenty of people hyped up about "classic Alterac Valley", original TM vs SS and finding out how it is to raid with 40 people (although you can  raid with up to 30 on retail). Those are the big things coming to my head.
---
And even BFA was busy as heck (from the players side) for the first month, despite the insane lag from 10 people pvping in the open world and other issues.
---
Classic will be there for a minimum of two years I reckon. Phase 1 is only a very minor part, considering it doesn't have much to offer besides the leveling. It does have Onyxia and MC but no Dire Maul or honor system and BGs. People need to chill, they are making themselves crazy thinking too much about it.
---
wat
---
This will keep me from playing as it’s not a vanilla experience
---
No and this is related to your computer. Without more information like a picture of the bluescreen you are experiencing we will be unable to help. Best bet is to upload a minidump if one is created from the crash. I can look in to it for you and tell you whats wrong, if you don't know what it is, where to find it, and if it isn't there how to setup windows one, google it.
---
Where do you guys "hear" things like this?
---
Aye, I'm very much the same, started out playing CS when I was way young and ended up speaking/typing English more than I actually utilized Swedish.
---
Did you not submit that post? It's literally stated in the title that you support their actions, fuck off.
---
Is that sarcasm?
---
You could still sell extra ore from mining, I don’t think engineering uses a huge amount.
---
I don't know which has convinced me more to avoid Classic. Streamers or Blizzard. #notsubbing
---
It's part of a greater experience. Always mobs for you to complete your quests? That's current wow, classic wow wasn't like that and people loved to play that game more than current wow.
---
Could influence a great South Park episode
---
I love seeing me some Dota arguments in the ClassicWow sub
---
....continue
---
Anyone know if I am able to reserve names with a starter edition tomorrow? It'd suck to have to waste 2 weeks worth of game time just because I want to reserve a dope name.
---
Then Blizzard needs to fucking realize they need to make more servers...regardless of attrition rates, this game is going to surprise everyone with the amount of people it brings in.
---
Fighting back against something you find unfair is normal. Also this could quite literally turn into a real BFA and the idea of streamers and their hordes vs Anti-streamer guilds and groups sounds entertaining Tbh
---
Imagine hundreds of people bitching and shit talking you even after you tell them 2 servers you 100% wont be on. He is obviously annoyed at the people being toxic in his chat. Streamers are not robots that are immune to emotions.
---
Good. I hope all you drama queens skip out on launch. More mobs for me.
---
It usually shows up through the official WoW forums, reddit or twitter.
---
Ok you're right, eau does not sound like ö. Still the example with ö is good i think.
---
Speaking of the Stockade entrance, I assume the same was for the gated area in the middle of the moat? Been trying to clip into that as well, no luck yet though.
---
i literally had a  bank lvl 1 called MYBANKER, I crated runecloth magewave bags etc and sent over, also DE greens to get mats for main.
---
Streamers are a cancer.
---
I've heard you can be banned for stream sniping in fornite but I don't have any evidence on me, so take that as you will
---
Oh wow I had no idea they had planned something like that, thanks for the info!
---
Worrying about their names instead of any of the bugs or the impending foreverlayers... it's actually outrageous. How these people are championed by the community is wild.
---
Hmmm
---
Yikes...
---
I play solo. Good to know! I didn't want to miss out cause I needed a special sub or something. Thank you very much!
---
No. Changes.
---
Did you get your name pre-reserved by Blizzard in 2004? No? Oh I guess NO CHANGES means you do not get it today either.
---
Very carefully
---
&gt; and don't expect "manners" from players in a video game.
---
You're not entirely wrong. My gripe is that there _used_ to be manners and expectations of how to behave on an RPPvP realm. But as GMs started becoming less sympathetic, anti-RP death squads started becoming more common.
---
As I said in the post, we play on RPPvP realms so we can better illustrate real threat towards 'enemy' players. On RPPvE, unless both people are flagged, you can only sort of flail menacingly at each other. On modern this isn't an issue because of the x-fac language potion, allowing meaningful interaction. But back then, on RPPvP realms you could physically attack enemy roleplayers, forcing a response, which was found more immersive and emphasized the danger of the world at large. The trouble comes from people starting to abuse this to purposefully disrupt RP and RPPvP.
---
If I was promoting CRZ or a cash shop, I'd understand. But dynamic spawns? Shouldn't you be asking how much I've sold myself to private servers?
---
Last I heard he wasn't going to even play Classic.
---
Bfa has 241 NA servers, but you think 11 classic servers is too many? Go troll elsewhere
---
Imagine if this happened in raid
---
With how many people are going to try it for a week or two then leave, server merges would likely be needed almost immediately to prevent the overwhelming majority of servers from having next to no players on them. No one, including the players, would enjoy having to deal with that many server merges that quickly.
---
Blizzard are actually quite reluctant to ban streamers who lag servers out just from their sheer hordes of fans. They slapped Swifty with a permanent ban several years ago because his sheer legion of fanboys were crashing a realm and the backlash was immense.
---
/w esfand Ret isnt viable
---
Exactly this. Any crying about unfair early reservation is just virtue signaling.
---
Okay coolio. That gives me more time to figure how to play retail before I get to start over clean and figure out how to play classic ahaha
---
And that's why there's all this hate for streamers rn, because of the name reserve thing?
---
For sure - I'm certainly not going to begrudge anyone who does enjoy Blizzard's interpretation of the "Classic" experience.  More power to those who do.  But I know it's not something I'm interested in at this time, and I'm pretty sure I'm not alone.
---
What also is concerning, is if these are the choices they are making for Classic now, what sorts of things will they do in the future?  It doesn't exactly bode well -- I think community outcry and pushback is the only way to prod Blizzard into doing what's best for the game, at times.
---
&gt;	You and half of the people you know are forced to change their names and their guild names, the community which you knew is now fragmented because half of the people had to change up their names.
---
Eh, duplicate names are not that common. And honestly, it can't be that unique if someone else has your name.
---
Or they could also just make names reserve across the entire region, instead of server only.
---
Merging and having a few people and guilds change names is a much lesser consequence than layering separating the community on a realm from each other.
---
Swe???
---
If you think streamers can make blizzard remove layering or add servers, you are nuts.
---
Hi, i’m a blizzard recruiter. We have some issues staffing up enough to solve the equation on how many servers to launch with and quite frankly.. how they even work. You seem to have it all figured out so I was wondering if I could reach out and schedule an interview for a position at our HQ in Ireland. 
---
Your logic isn't wrong, you just assume the wheel of justice turns fast enough and is accurate enough to catch them with the precision and speed required for your formula to be accurate. 
---
The problem is botting isn't as easily detectable as people like to believe. If the solution is just ban them 4head, we wouldn't be here discussing it.
---
You’d think it’d have been a common sense business play too, right?
---
Reading books.
---
Ended up autorunning through the door and falling to my death.
---
Still can't believe that was a thing. That's some Florida level shit.
---
Ohh ✌
---
You might find this video useful. For a Human it would be much easier due to the 10% extra rep racial.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF_K869mcUE
---
their names aren't important whatsoever though, nor is them getting a name going to actually change if they play blizzards product.
---
There are no doubt more than 10k private server aussie players right now, let alone all the retail players who will turn up for Classic.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if we get 200-500k Aussie players
---
Is Blizzard retarded? Just give the Brazilians and Spanish their own servers. Video game drama is so easily avoidable. We're not demanding anything unreasonable.
---
There weren't twitch streamers in classic wow. #NOCHANGES
---
Why are you all so upset, noone wants to take my name. Hundreds of people are going to try to get a streamer name. It makes sense.
---
That’s sucks man. Hopefully they get it sorted out
---
Yes, because people are only allowed to focus on one issue.
---
Joke or not, anything could happen 2-3 months down the line
---
Ty =)
---
Their name isn’t important to you, but I bet you’d like your own. I’d certainly like to have my preferred name.
---
I'm fine with this.
---
Nothing is more frustrating than being a popular streamer then finding out that your name and similar variations of it have been taken by hundreds of fanboys.
---
Layer hoping will still be possible, resource farming on different layers, avoiding campers, etc etc etc. Thats terrible and might end up ruining the economy/game for many, why is it so hard to understand? Layering is a crap feature, its a huge bandage that may hurt the game more than it helps it.
---
Neither are they apparently kek.
---
im not super anti layering, i do think its gonna be neccecary on launch (and only on launch) but i feel like at this point blizz need to do the same thing other mmo's do and just let you straight up select what shard you wanna be on in the right click menu if you click yourself. this is bad
---
There's a massive difference between a few saying it and it actually impacting population.
---
Are there guilds being formed to prevent them from getting world first shit like scarab lord?
---
so then people abuse resources even more than how people have complained and speculated for layering?
---
Crafting professions in general do not make money. You have to invest so much of your own resources into leveling them, and chances are that you'll never make that money back. Alchemy is probably the only exception to that since pots, elixirs and flasks are used extensively when raiding. The warriors I've known who made lots of gold did it by renting out their tanking services to 5 man pugs, or farming elementals for essences.
---
Yeah but we won’t even get to that point if they kill the game upon release.
---
I've been discussing with some pro-pvp today and he told me that in case of ally mages the decission is practically irrelevant and up to the player to choose since both EA and Perception are very situational skills that are very good if you know how to use them.
---
In case of the horde y much more clear the difference (troll pve and undead pvp).
---
Yeah that's why. The streamers refuse to announce what server they're making characters on tomorrow and it's flustering everyone.
---
On one hand, it makes sense for the streamers because they want the best chances of their names not getting taken.
---
On the other hand, I completely understand the player base frustrations because a lot of folks want to avoid the streamer servers. It basically forces those folks to either roll the dice and hope they get their names saved on a non-streamer server, or they have to sit on their hands refreshing https://www.avoidstreamers.com/ to see what server is safe and hope that their names are available.
---
Somebody call Blizzard's marketing team. This needs to be the TV commercial for WoW Classic.
---
If your name is taken pick another one. Like everyone else who pays for a sub does.
---
Including preventing world first scarab lord?? Oh please let that be the case
---
Let the meme games begin!
---
It do it and charge them 10k for me to delete it
---
I'm gonna be bringing all the trolls, not because their racials or anything. I just like trolls.
---
My man.
---
Once you all join the raid layering doesn't matter. Your all on the same layer
---
With any luck Blizz will add a second pvp server if we pull numbers like that. :)
---
Man, this is sad to look at and i think you brought up a great point.  I haven't kept up on this layering thing but the cities need to feel big.  I loved going around looking at everyone in the city.
---
It's like the snap happened.
---
Yeah he literally just stated a fact and if that is tough on you then that sucks but its true
---
this is not accurate for classic. pservers used higher rep rates.
---
Is it possible to get the sexy voice that for example Esfand uses? I almost come in my pants every time I hear that voice.
---
An unwise decision ! I shall alert Thrall of your betrayal. Mok'gra
---
Or just reserve the name Asmon and all the other guys I'm to lazy to look up.  The only reason to take one of their names is to troll them.   I mean you can see why they might be at a disadvantage when it comes to actually getting their name.  This is basically win, win.  They can announce now and we can avoid streamer servers and they can get their name.
---
I'll probably go back to private servers when a new one is released.
---
this is sad
---
Mankrik living up to it's name.
---
This is a pretty worthless post, I can see why the mods want to delete it.
---
The hate-boner for streamers is getting out of hand.
---
Yeah it's more they're gathering at a certain area, you're welcome to join them or avoid them if you dont want to deal with a language barrier, "calling a server" arent the right words to use in this case
---
*panicked NA East noises* 
---
Delay the name reservation please the man children aren’t ready this is a clusterfuck
---
I stream, but I don't plan on streaming this game. I run my business on stream.  I don't see why your name is so important on the game, isn't it the streaming platform name that matters?
---
Also just a quick FYI, if you actually played the character and did quests and stuff your quest addons might save that quest as completed. You can reset that by going into the char folder, then savedvariables and delete the lua and bak file of questie or whatever addon.
---
Sorry but the people commenting here clearly are not used to duel a lot. 
---
Like you said, letting a rogue or a warrior open is very normal stuff. Because if a hunter just sits in a flare and a trap, there’s no chance I’m gonna try to open with those conditions as a rogue. So it becomes a game of patience, and no one wants that. The solution is to jus let the rogue opens, and every experienced pvp’er knows that. It’s also just more realistic as you’re not gonna wait in a flare in world pvp. 
---
Obviously don’t use potions either, because then it would become a game of who has the most gold to spend on duels. 
---
Stuff like engi items or thistle tea is lore debatable and should be talked about beforehand if you wanna be sure it’s gonna be a fair duel. Some people also avoid using huge CD’s like Cold Snap/Prep/Divine Shield. Lay on Hand is obviously out of the question.
---
Laugs in Eu 
---
not really serious. I am just glad i do not have to deal with it and i really think the streamer problem is not nearly as huge as people think
---
Do you mind linking me the elvui download? I want to make sure I can set it up tonight before stress goes down. Thanks!
---
Blizz should let them pre register one character so that way they can keep their name and at the same time choose their realm. It's a win-win and everyone could finally move on with their lives.
---
Doing something else as gaming ?
---
Thanks man!
---
I suddenly want to play a rogue and only kill soda naked and when I have all cds up to prove that I don’t need any gear, like his idea is going to prevent me from raiding on horde side.
---
Welcome to r/classicwow
---
No it hasn't. They haven't officially closed a single server in the game's history.
---
They got around the bad press by "connecting" realms over time. Straight up closing servers causes a very different reaction.
---
You're complaining about a feature that's main purpose is to help filter the ***live*** version of the game, which will have way more people in it. 
---
You're on a stress test server, which as of 5:33pm, has a Low player population. 
---
Of course it won't look full.
---
&gt;  Also occurs to me that new players who haven't been keeping up to date with information about classic aren't going to know about layering and are going to get to the big cities, find them empty and assume that is just normal... or that the game just isn't popular.
---
this is a very good point. other mmos that have systems like layering let you select what shard you wanna be on so at least that is an indication that you are not seeing everything. in wow there is absolutely 0 indication that things aren't dead
---
1. They perform great in world and group PvP. Enh has a higher skill curve and is easily kited. Ele while weak in phase 1 becomes a monster once gear comes out in AQ that really supports the class. 
---
2. Mana management sucks, yes you will be drinking a lot. 
---
3. 95% of shamans will be expected to raid heal. If you join a good guild and prove yourself you may get to go enh. Ele can’t keep up mana long enough for most fights. Don’t expect to pug dps shammy easily. 
---
4. Mostly just completion against other shamans.
---
(Note they are one of the most wanted healers and there I’ll be a quite a few)
---
5. Enh is best until 40 or so and then you could go ele if you wanted. Enh has great survivability and is fun to quest with/ very little down time between mobs
---
Priest is the best class to pick if you want to play a priest :P
---
Personally I think Troll is the best overall. The only reason I would pick Undead is if you really want Will of the Forsaken or if you prefer the way they look.
---
Someone made an addon that did this a couple years ago and it was really good, but it was taken down due to ToS violations. It had something to do with voice acting the text and copyright. I can't remember the exact reason though.
---
I'm paying the same amount as soda or asmon is to play doni get special treatment too?
---
Yeah so they don’t have to close them here either. They can idle at low pop like love. Look solved!
---
Already been done.
---
for a long time we weren't even allowed to discuss classic on /r/wow.
---
Yeah, but if I have rank 6 AI will it try to buff the level 17 priest with rank 2 or 6?

I was part of an alliance raid on cross roads about an hour ago. We raided for about an hour, it was 15 guildies. After a while of killing solo players we layered into another raid on raid fight. There were two raids of alliance vs one raid of horde plus guards. It was silky smooth, no lag at all, really really fun. Lots of back and forth, pushing each other back. Flanking from behind trees. It was amazing. Paladins bubbling eachother, mages seeping everything, loads of healing, loads of spells flying everywhere, it was ace.
---
It should be all that matters, but the big WoW streamers seem to think differently. I can't blame them that much though, as I'm really hoping to get my 3 favorite names as well. I still hope I don't end up on their server!
---
Im not sure if thats possible but i havent tried making one. I'll comment here again if i find out.
---
yeah its retail-like wow
---
Yes that's true for 40 man raid. But back in the days it was much, much more for stormwind raid 😀 also a lot of players just went with the group not thing about being in raid group.
---
I have no idea what you are talking about, and it doesn't matter what you are talking about.
---
You made an assumption about what OP meant, OPs post disagreed with you, end of story.
---
And besides: We are talking about a MAGE here. Escape artist is completely redundant, when you have blink, and can FN all slowing melees.
---
So, anything else you wanna add to the discussion?
---
Absolutely. This should never have even been a thought.
---
its staying
---
I’m from Latin American and I stay the fuck away from latin american players whenever possible.
---
yes?
---
Kind of agree with it
---
They will not enforce these rules on streamers...
---
APES have generally been Alliance, but there's been some rumours around that they're going Horde to target a different pserver guild, so it's a 50/50 on what they'll play since they're trying to be secretive about it.  
---
They tend to flock towards whichever server is more populated so they'll likely go for Shazz.
---
Guild led by the infamous 500x rank 14 warrior called Monkeynews
---
Did you download the newest version? It wasn't doing anything for me either until I updated it.
---
Since it’s just the stress test I was going for full 5/5 improved corruption
---
I think it was a madseason video where he did research into early development of WoW and this was originally going to be where you would access player housing areas, before they decided to scrap the entire idea prior to launch.
---
Sitting afk in ghost is content?
---
3 or 4 mages could probably pom Pyro you easily.
---
At least we'll be able to say we tried to do something. All of these changes added to Classic are shameful.
---
layering will still be there
---
Then the stress test is wrong. I tagged a ton of stuff at like 10% health after people had already died.
---
Lmaoooo
---
I don't understand? How does what people said to him change the last screenshot ?
---
2 replies = to much attention? 
---
I’m sorry bro. I’ll ease you into social interaction better next time. I can see and understand why it might be hard for you.
---
STOP SNITCHIN!
---
Because they didn't need layering in the beta because only streamers were in the beta the beta was limited to maybe a couple thousand people
---
Nice, it's always fun to know the name of the realm you're gonna roll on! :D Good luck!
---
I hope they will announce spanish servers soon so the subreddit can go back to hating on streamers
---
&gt;So I’m out.
---
Thanks. You are clearly going to remain intentionally dense on this issue so there's no reason to continue.
---
&gt;PVE it is, I guess...
---
Hey man, if that's where you belong...
---
&gt;I noticed quests start giving almost 50s+ around lvl 15
---
Lol they are only giving 50s+ because you're playing a stress test where the exp is capped at 15, so you're getting gold compensation instead of EXP.
---
This is not anywhere near the amount of silver you will be getting for those quests on live.
---
lol that fire is vicious
---
So have more serves. If they fall in pop, merge them. Problem solved in 10 seconds of thought. Layering is a corporate joke.
---
ha
---
I guess it's better than swedes pronunciating golemagg gølemak

Temporary is at the end of phase one, like blizz has stated. I was just trying to calm you out of your autistic rage and make you see reason. Clearly that is not going to work.

Nah that wasn't official, just troll posts. [Here is the official post from the spanish coalition.](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/es/wow/t/servidor-de-la-comunidad-pvp-shazzrah/10760)
---
I was there for that. 
---
For those that don't know Crossroads is a place of art and culture. A retreat for philosophers and scholars. Poetry can be heard on the corners.
---
The evil alliance attacked these peaceful people. Villainy.
---
That's not even Blizzard's reason for layering, so no, it's not to solve overpopulation. Layering was added in attempt to solve the drop off in population.
---
Activision Blizzard
---
I completely agree. All we have is our Rabble Rabble Rabble now
---
The reason you’re seeing high quest reward money is because you stop gaining xp at level 15 on the stress test.
---
You think THAT comment is "toxic" ?
---
Can you do some internal thinking for me and examine your statement to find what specific point you are trying to disprove?
---
Oh didn't realize that there was a compensation thing thanks
---
Also, while I've got you, being a solo player will be a bit rough in Classic. It's meant to be a group-related game, so doing a lot of the content alone is very hard as you get higher in levels. Elite quests in particular are impossible to solo at quest level, whereas almost any class can solo them in the current live game.
---
I'm so sorry! I re-read the comments in other posts that were talking about it and realized I had misunderstood the first time. (They were talking about *if* the streamers choose Herod, not that they had already.) I've updated it to fix that!
---
Unless I'm vastly overestimating interest in this game there's no way that population will drop to playable levels with disabled layering when we have this few servers... Everything seems to indicate that Blizzard is planning to keep layering on for a long long time... For example EU (minus France, Russia and Germany) only gets 2 pvp servers... Do you really think that just 3k people will be left on each of them 2 months after release? Nost had 10-15k concurrent players and it was a private server...
---
Enhancements only use is to run out mounted to someone who is unsuspicious and do lots of damage (if you get lucky) that's it. for anything else it's completely garbage, so I'll talk about elemental for now on.
---
1. Elemental is great in both wpvp and organized pvp. They don't have massive aoe(though CL does hit up 3) so they aren't kings of 20+vs20+ or anything, but something like 5v5 they are great.
---
2. They oom fairly fast but not faster than their enemies OOH's if you catch my drift.
---
3. Yes.
---
4. Most of the amazing elemental pvp gear is either pvp only or healing gear. If you let your guild know in advance you are only healing in raids to get pvp gear, then it's not that competitive, but then again most guilds have a fuck ton of shamans. 
---
5. There honestly isn't one. GENERALLY it's enhancement till 40, then either enhancement for the rest of respec elemental. And either dagger + shield or big phat 2hander pre 40.
---
Thalnos was Brazil
---
Had a great battle outside crossroads, sent the alliance packing after a good solid fight!
---
I'm a bit disappointed by stuff like this as well. IIRC you could bring up your Hunter's Pet tab by right click and inspecting your pet's unit frame. On this client that isn't possible, and instead there's this big useless menu like you pointed out.
---
Oh no. That’s concerning... shit
---
Why does only this subreddit want to kill my computer?  CPU goes from 7.8% usage on an 8700k then all the sudden Firefox is hitting 95% usage when I first get here, hit refresh and/or when I start to scroll for several seconds. Even writing/editing in this field seems to trigger a usage spike from time to time.
---
Next guess would be to try it with just that one enabled. If it works, enable any other addons one at a time. 
---
Maybe one is interfering with it.
---
Level cap is 15 on the stress test so at best they have instant corruption.
---
The only thing you're going to do by camping them is create content / world pvp for their youtubes to generate more money. I don't want to be on their server either, but its delusional to think you're going to force them to do anything.
---
However, I'm also pointing out that people in this thread who think they're exempt from punishment because they don't show their face on a webcam are going to be in for a rude awakening.
---
Oh, so it affects your ability to play the game at all. Ooph, okay good to know.
---
Questing will only get you part way there, you'll still need to do some runecloth hand ins at 60.

You come off as obsessed with really strange priorities.

how hard was it?

/r/freefolk don't deserve Bobby B. Just as we wish to go back to 2004, so to do many GoT fans wish to go back to before Season 8. Here we can believe it's still 2004 and 2011 simultaneously with Bobby B at our beck and call.
---
Not a chance blizzard takes action against their streamers
---
still trying to decide my class. i was dead set on paladin but now the guys i know said they are going horde so i need to change it. other than that ive been playing some other games like oxygen not included that just got its full release. and fucking around on the stress test a little but mostly for nostalgia not actual leveling
---
YOU'RE THE KING'S HAND! YOU'LL DO AS I COMMAND, OR I'LL FIND ME A HAND WHO WILL!
---
Comment above yours says the opposite. He said fury and then arms from 40+
---
I used to play on Shattered Hand but I am pretty sure that most scandis left that place back in Cata. Seems to just be the chinese guilds left on there.
---
Any idea what amount we talking ?
---
Horde mats and sell them when people start being able to afford to use the AH
---
Like I said to someone else, I just reread the comments I saw talking about it, and realized that they were talking about *if* the streamers choose Herod, not that they had already. Sorry about that! I've fixed it and added a note.
---
&gt;  Not to mention I had an unlimited supply of lesser magic essence from vendor on every new shard.
---
Now this is truly some gamebreaking shit. What the fuck were they thinking? Every single rare vendor recipe is no longer rare.
---
I hate it too but let’s try to have some perspective, it’s just 2nd generation l33tspeak. We were all running around screaming WOOT and shit in 2005.
---
Is there a classic add-on that finds nearby rares?
---
Wow, you are a salty cookie. Sorry to break this to you, but you were discussing it with me. You replied to my comment after all. The fact that you left out escape artist in your lengthy post in this thread shows you didn't really know it was a thing. I guess if you don't know anything about PVP it's easy to forget that PVP racials exist. The fact that you think that blink makes escape artist redundant underlines that. Blink has a CD and ranged movement impairment exists.
---
OP said:
---
&gt;that's what I'm talking. i know there is a difference, but my question is how much big it is that difference and how will affect me in order to play.
---
That's not him agreeing or disagreeing with me. That's him pointing out that he wants to know what the difference is between races and how big this difference is. For you to then misconstrue that and use it as a way to brush of anything I say is not constructive at all. At this point you're not trying to find an answer to OPs question, you just want to be right, regardless of whether you actually are.
---
On retail I played a 60 rogue and 60 warrior.  had a 40 something hunter and druid.  
---
Really torn between druid and hunter.
---
Pro for a hunter is I can be a dwarf!
---
Intresting. So im assuming when they split the servers into single world servers everyone will get a free world change as well.
---
Toxic : https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.urbandictionary.com/define.php%3fterm=Toxic&amp;amp=true
---
What he said was rude, yes. Laughing at my mistake is toxic.  Considering someone else responded appropriately, I don’t see why he has to be different.
---
🤷‍♂️ I've never played a game, destiny included, that I couldn't play solo. I'm trying really hard to make friends, but I really enjoy the challenge. It's kind of a paradox. I want to play with others, but I enjoy playing by myself more.
---
Check out the Taverns OST as well, it's also on Spotify.
---
Maybe if they made layering just for starting zones then disabled it once you get out in the world.
---
RemindMe! 15 days “Install addon memoria”
---
And that ban was immediately reversed because it was Swifty. You just defeated yourself.
---
The other guy is mistaken. Doing w/p/m*3 is super easy. You just have a couple binds on different keys for your tank and dps(sunder is frostbolt, thunderclap is blizzard[with an @player modifier], etc etc.) and maybe a wand for the healer on sunder too. All 
---
Then you just heal with the healer on a click through box with clique and grid.
---
4mage and priest will be pretty good and it will actually require a lot more coordination with aggro dropping and kiting.
---
For leveling it's not great, but at max level you can the best tank (prot), one of the best melee dps (fury) or one of the best pvp spec (arms).
---
So yeah warrior really only blooms at level 60.

*adjusts tinfoil hat*
---
That's what Blizzard is likely counting people to do. Burn out half their subscription as some kind of quasi pre-purchase since retail isn't enticing enough to resubscribe.
---
yes easily. 
---
You don't have to optimize spec for 1-60 non-raid content. So at 60, you may not have a 100% min/maxed cat dps spec or a 100% min/maxed bear spec, but you can get almost there just by maxing out all the cat and bear talents offensive talents in feral, and grabbing Furor and Omen of Clarity.
---
you'll skip Natural Shapeshifter which is needed for maximizing cat dps - doesn't matter if you don't raid. You can also skip thick hide which many raid tanking bear druids spec into - again, doesn't matter for you.
---
Not sure why you're being downvoted.  This isn't the beta, this is a fucking layering stress test, they're trying to dial in their numbers for launch, they way overlayered on the last test, so now its been changed up, fine tuned.
---
This is all ignoring the fact they've already stated that layering won't be permanent anyhow.  Even if it lasts the entirety of P1, who cares?  It'll be gone after the initial insane launch hype.  Anyone who quits because of layering is an idiot, and anyone who screams the game is dead *two weeks before its even launched* is a complete moron.
---
My group managed to get all the way to Smite with me tanking as warrior, a paladin, a warlock and a hunter. Boat was too hard and the hunter had to go, but it was a great time :)
---
Ret deals trash DPS in PvE and it doesn't provide any support that can't be better and more efficiently handled by other specs.
---
Because its inevitable. It's the lesser of two evils. Either they use layering and have healthy servers long term or make 50 servers with a single or two with a healthy population. Also, release wound be almost impossible to pull off without layering

I agree that the difference on horde is much bigger. I disagree however that the decision is practically irrelevant. While both perception and escape artist are situational, the latter has more applications than the former. Neither are always relevant however and, as stated before, a human mage will still be plenty powerful without it.
---
Yeah this is bullshit. 
---
Can’t believe how quickly this community decided that layering was okay as soon as the mods started banning discussions on it. People just fall in line anytime a perceived authority steps in.
---
Now... well, hopefully it’s not too late to get this shit fixed.
---
The sad part is, the same people who support it are the same people who hate Classic and said we would never get servers.
---
They will also be the ones to say the games dead when they are standing in Orgrimmar and they can't see anyone.
---
why would the launch another server when they can just add some layers?
---
Zones were always "instanced" like this, even in retail vanilla.
---
This was my first thought.
---
I throw my AI buff on any mana user I see that doesn't have one unless its the starting area at the start of classic as I would be OOM all the time and would never level.
---
Sure but Blizzard is the one with the market research and access to both current WoW's retention rate and the retention rate of vanilla WoW. If they think the majority of players are going to leave, they're probably correct. 
---
And yes, it's definitely temporary. They've already given us a worst case scenario which is when phase 2 lands. If phase 2 launches and layering is still around, then you can complain about it not being temporary.
---
I don't really care too much about name reservations, but what are you guys doing for tomorrow?  I'm probably going to try and reserve my name on 3 of the NA PvP servers and see which one I want to play on after I hear where streamers choose.  Herod looks like it'll be the most populated though.
---
Because you're acting like an ass and most people don't do that unprompted.
---
Thank you, I'll give it a shot.
---
Thanos snaping
---
 you and your kind actively ruining classic with pacifist, ball sucking comments like this.
---
No problem
---
This. Just go pick up a LMW at level 7-8 when you get 20silver and then enjoy 15 super easy levels.
---
The community on this discord has been very talkative and kind.
---
The beta has been over for some time now. There is a stress test going on right now, but that ends tomorrow.
---
you know, you could have included the rest of the shot to substantiate the issue and just magnified the chat box
---
calling someone toxic = being toxic? okay.
---
theres a trick with engineering, at level 35ish while your still saving for your mount you goto arathi highlands where the iron ore is. Do laps around the edge of the zone mining the iron (good for leveling mining), then make stacks of iron grenades. Vender the grenades. its prob not great to do this at 60? but at level 35-40 its profitable Im told. I plan to try it on my hunter.
---
Has anyone done a duo level as rogue / mage? Have a friend I'll be playing with a lot that is set on mate. Initially I was going to play priest but don't want to heal and have heard shadow is ass. Played a hunter most of vanilla but had a 29 twink rogue. My other option to level with him is hunter since I know I enjoy it but raided all content up to the first 2 in naxx and felt like trying something new. How good or bad is rogue mage leveling?
---
Layering should just be fucking disabled like the brain of the dude that invented this shit.
---
Invest your linen cloth in First Aid, bandages mean you can life-tap for mana and health funnel your Void Walker with little downtime. They also help for an "oh shit" moment, where you can fear or have your Void Walker taunt a mob and emergency bandage.
---
If you happen to find a wand from a quest or as a drop, use it. Wands really are a caster's best friend. They're free damage and at low levels they work incredibly well.
---
Most importantly though: Just because you have a pet, doesn't mean you can pull multiple mobs. Multi-mob pulls will kill you more often than not. Pull one at a time from range and wait until the mob is in a safe area before sending in your void walker, in order to reduce the chance of adds.
---
Also, never forget to make yourself a health stone.
---
If you can't be civil then there's point in replying. You obviously have never played Vanilla. Ret Pallies being invited as dps was very much a thing. It will be a thing in Classic. You didn't bring specs. That's YOUR cancerous retail mentality. You brought the class and the player to the raid. Ret Pallies had a bunch of utilities that other classes lacked. 
---
You don't get Hand of Rag by PvPing btw.
---
I dont mind a broken launch tbh. call me crazy but yeah i just done care and often times its pretty fun memories afterwards
---
Wands are great for casters. You can make one yourself really early really easily:

It depends on what you mean.  It wasn't called "Dungeon Finder" until it had cross realm capability.  
---
In 2.0.1 (pre bc) the LFG tool was included which gave an interface to the LFG channel basically.  
---
In patch 3.1 it was introduced to allow role selection 
---
In 3.3 it was modified to allow cross realm dungeon parties.

I really liked the LFG tool from 2.0.1 and wish we were getting it in classic.
---
thanks for all of the info.  please close thread mods!
---
Sounds a little risky
---
Try turning off the CSS, see if that makes a difference.
---
Them literally saying layering isn't set to it's proper parameters isn't enough I guess. Keep doing the doomsday dance, I'm sure that's fun.
---
They closed a handful of realms on EU after opening free migrations to Russian servers, after which the Russian heavy servers promptly literally died overnight.
---
This isn't a problem in Classic, so there's literally no good reason not to do merges that couldn't be solved by having cross-realm name reservations. That's basically what layering is already, except with a ton of extra issues.
---
No, but everyone won’t be clumped in one area.
---
People like actually playing games. More at 11
---
Dude your accounts clearly been hacked. If none of the friends are yours, someone's been using your account.
---
You missed out on BC man, it was really something special.  Don't get me wrong, I loved Vanilla and I'm hyped out of my skull for Classic, but I'd probably implode into a blackhole of endless hype if they announced a BC redux, because BC was basically *Vanilla WoW:  Itemization Now Makes Some Sense*, and the actual meme specs became at least viable enough to where you'd be denied from groups because of your spec.  People bitch about flying mounts, but it was such a negligible issue at that point in time, with it only being in Outland and only at max level rather than the entire available gameworld and 60 all the way to 120 like it is now.
---
&gt;The sad thing is most of these upvotes are from legit assholes thinking you were serious, sigh.
---
A lot of these 'assholes' are just kids having fun. Why would you let them bother you that much?
---
&gt;Roll PvE if you want a greater chance at avoiding assholes guys.
---
Please. Nothing is more annoying than players complaining and whining because of toxic PvP engagements in a game titled "World of WARcraft"
---
You know launch is in 2 weeks right? It's not alpha. I'd assume these bugs are damn near impossible to fix in that time frame.
---
Paladin is just the ultimate support class. Always a good reason to choose Alliance.
---
I get the thousand yard stare when I remember that Camp T didn't have a flight point back in the day. The run from Crossroads to Southern Barrens was hell and took *forever*
---
I don't need to hate on and hope BfA will fail, its doing plenty good of a job all on its own of that.
---
Paladin is going to be way easier to level and ret is very good in pvp. Just be prepared that if you plan to raid at all your only really viable option will be to heal.
---
I'm in for sure. 2 kids makes it tough to get more than a couple of hours are any time. I have no preference between horde, alliance or time zone. I think if the guild was on one of the RP servers there is a good chance of finding more people that would be interested.
---
With name reservations tomorrow, has a server been decided on?
---
Broken Tooth maybe. Lupos worthless in classic.
---
I agree. At least with Classic coming out, we can get truly vanilla-like private server values in case they fuck this up.
---
the real question is why would there be a different number of "infinite" layers compared to pre-chosen? It wouldn't make much sense would it lol.     
---
But I guess if we're going to make it biased towards pre-chosen layers being better then yes you'd hypothetically be able to get more resources with "infinite" since there are more of them when it should be equal.     
---
If we're talking about the better way that for both scenarios the number of layers is equal like it should be, then I can have myself or a group time the spawns of anything important (like black lotus) for a per channel basis. (This is what happens in mmos with channels for special resources)
---
"Right. Where am I going here? Yes, the switchovers. If you're transfering to a new server, don't expect people to do the same things in the new place they did on your old server. Like separate societies, each server, while having common ground and roots, has evolved and developed it's own freakishly weird identity. The rules you may have played through on your old server, may not be common place on the new one. Don't argue about it with the pick-up group you've joined, you'll most likely only irritate people."  
---
Right in the feels.
---
ah petitions. the only equivalent of holding a carboard sign
---
Hey pal, I don't come around steppin on your jokes!
---
&gt;I mean, yeah, I fully agree this is World of WARcraft, and we aren't supposed to be friendly with the opposing faction, but that isn't being toxic. That isn't even remotely being toxic. Killing them and spitting on them is the game of the game. That's how it's played.
---
It is toxic. But toxicity can be fun. 
---
That's why the snowflakes that whine and cry about toxicity have their PvE and RP servers they can flock to.
---
WTB someone to make an EU version
---
One can hope. There's almost 200 people in the 5-8 range in Durotar right now, but I'm all alone in Sen'Jin village on my layer.
---
&gt;Ret Pallies had a bunch of utilities that other classes lacked. 
---
Describe those utilities to me in detail, please.
---
&gt; You don't get Hand of Rag by PvPing btw.
---
No shit. It's irrelevant for PvE though, which is the reason why you give it to anyone who likes to PvP and doesn't mind throwing away several thousand gold on Sulfuron Hammer.
---
And I was gonna main on thalnos, tell them to go to a server with a worse nane
---
Yeah 6+ months ago you wouldn't find a positive post on r/wow regarding Classic, it was either straight up ignored as "it'll never be big enough to care about" or "its stupid and its going to fail because its stupid you think you do but you don't".
---
Now its pretty positive because I think enough people have realized that Classic is actually "Kind of a Big Deal".
---
I think the mob will be attenuated a little bit when the real game is out.  There's not much to do on a limited stress test lvl capped to 15 except for fucking around.
---
for the record there is wand spec: thats basically disc, you powerword shield swp the mob then wand it down. Its surprisingly tanky which makes it friendly to level with and you can heal the dungs as you level without trouble. I didnt feel the need to respec out of it, it handled everything upto and inc molten core fine.

Are you mental challenged?

In 1.12 Questie there is definitely an option to hide mob/objective locations and only show the pick up/turn in points on the minimap.
---
Can't confirm for Classic but I'd assume the option is still there...

That's exactly what layering is, without the drama involved in moving guilds around and forcing people to rename characters.

By the time you get there you might even be level 3 just from the exploration xp.

Ah you do not seem to be informed about transgender people and their issues, but that's okay, it is sadly still a not so widely known issue and many people have misinformed and exploited it for political purposes, devaluating the devastating psychological and social effect it has on transgender people. 
---
Just in case you didn't know, the word Angwe used and you didn't seem to be concerned to censor, is indeed a slur equivalent to the N-word and the F-word, and it is refered within the LGBT community as the T-word :)
---
Just as a head ups in case you'd want to edit it in case mods find it problematic.
---
Apart from that, the language and the personal questions uttered to that alledged transgender person are quite rude and harmful, even if unintentional (which seemed intentional, considering the word Angwe used), due to how vulnerable trans people already are and the how awful gender dysphoria is (if you aren't aware of how big of a deal a dysphoria is, you can look up "Dysphoria" on Wikipedia).
---
Sorry for the long message, you probably don't care since you seem mildly defensive and agressive in your messages, as in it looks like you knew what you were complaining about, but I just hope you can understand a little better why it might have seem vomiting to me.
---
To make sure people spend money on subs to reserve names ofc xD  people are such sad dumb sheep...im actually amazed people defend this dumpster of a company.. I have waited for Classic for three years...Layering has NO PLACE in big cities or even after level 25 in the world. They keep the world layered as a whole cause they are LAZY, nothing more. People who say otherwise are just stupid or trolling. I agree with your comment 100%, names mean fuck all at this point.
---
Hi EU here
---
 UK specifically... What are the important dates and times I should be aware of?
---
What conceptual implementation of layering will work on EU's _two_ PvP realms, without remaining active for like 6 months and thus completely destroying both any sense of community and economy?
---
There is no fucking blacklist you weenie
---
Thats not how reddit works. No one is going to personally close your thread for you. You literally can delete it yourself.
---
WTS Tier 1 for wow token
---
Considering they've already stated layering will be permanently shut off after a while, if they reneged on that, we'd be completely justified in wild rioting about how Blizz is garbage.

OP you should teach Blizzard a lesson and refuse to play. That would teach them and all of us that are just looking forward to playing the game.
---
You have to name your character in fiction.  That's the only official one. Otherwise, people breaking other people's role playing immersion is looked down on.
---
100% agree.  No one should pick a *class* based on thinking it will be more desirable for other people.
---
Are any of the current stress-test servers being hosted on the west coast? I'd like to check the ping. I'm CDT and getting 20ms ping on Stalagg, so I assume it's EDT. I'd like to compare before I make my final decision.
---
Whitemane is looking to be the 4chan preferred server, if that bothers you. They've made a bit of a fuss over it.
---
Move anything works for you?

It was showing for me, but I also checked the 'show friendly healer names' box in the interface options just to be safe. It's also working with MikScrollingBattleText.
---
Literally play whatever you think is fun. Every class and spec can clear every piece of content in Vanilla, despite what most of reddit will have you believe.
---
Open up the servers : Harod 1, Harod 2, Harod 3, Harod 4, Harod 5. Make it clear from the start they will be merged in the coming months. No issue.
---
I-i-it's just a beta!

Ion promised layering was going to be only for starting zones, err I mean only till phase 2.

Oh.. are they known for retail or is it a new thing?

No one is afraid of blacklists. This thread is solely created to reassure the public that streamers who think they hold power over your play experience are truly idiotic and powerless, and that there ARE channels an average player can go through to report a streamer SHOULD something like this occur.

Hey don’t mean to mentally challenged dude ur a monster
---
Blizzard gave us a wonderful tool to combat botters and griefers.  The right click report cheating system in game has thresholds that will automatically suspend people's account if enough reports are filed.  This tool can be used for taking our streamers too!
---
If a streamer rolls on your server, and enough people report him, he will be temp banned 24 hours or until review.   #TpsOut even made a video and told us how to do it.  So if you want to ruin a streamers day just like they ruined yours, just report them.  If everyone reports them for cheating, they will keep getting suspended.  Thus never be able to actually play on your server. 
---
So if we get enough people to make a concerted effort to find the Steamers and report them (you only need about 40 people), you can get them temporarily suspended.  Could you imagine all the streamers getting suspended day 1 of server opening.  What would they do for content?  That would be absolutely glorious.
---
[Tips Out tells us all about how to "Right Click Report" and what it can do.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SbjASLwA34)
---
&gt; Maybe I'm just rusty but I'm finding wall jumping on this client leagues harder than it was in retail vanilla. 
---
Yeah it is a lot harder than it was for most of vanilla. My video is comparing it to 1.12.1 (the last patch / tbc prepatch) (which is what all private servers run on) which was when they nerfed it. Most people just remember the earlier stuff. 
---
But it is 100% still possible. Just difficult
---
Whether he's being sarcastic or not is beside the point because what he's saying will probably end up being true regardless of his personal intent or perspective.

---
I'm concerned primarily on a few specific fronts. 
---
One, a HUGE part of classic was being able to run into the same people, be them enemies or friends. layering has a very strong chance of disrupting this, especailly if its even remotely like it has been in the stress tests (vs how its supposed to work with 3k -ish players staying in their layer). 
---
Two, it seems like its easy enough to swap layers that people are currently able to abuse it to get extra resources. Even something such as being able to buy time limited vendor items can significantly effect the game economy for example. This abuse can also be used (and has been in the stress tests) to avoid ganks by joining groups and the like as well, which will absolutely destroy world pvp.
---
Third, people could very well miss out on pvp events. Imagine being in crossroads and seeing people freak out in defense, and finding your crossroads empty. 
---
Ultimately I think a lot of this could be solved if they REALLY locked down layering (perhaps only allowing players to swap layer once a day, in major cities only, when joining a guild?), but from EVERYTHING we've seen from stress tests it doesn't work this way at all, thus the concern!
---
And as far as phase 1 being relatively minor in the lifespan of classic, i disagree. The initial feeling of launch will decide MANY players opinion on the game, and far more people will leave if they have to deal with the above crap (Imagine entering orgrimar/stormwind for the first time to find it empty, or being about to kill that guy who ganked you only for him to join a group and dissapear mid combat)
---
A big part of the reason why I fell off from WoW was that after they introduced global instancing, cities and zones started to feel really dead. I remember when IF and SW and ORG and all those places would damn near crash your computer -- not necessarily ideal, but it *felt* like a city.
---
Then they do this stuff and you see other people walking around, sometimes, maybe.
---
Maybe just instance out the AH and Bank so that they don't suck up as many resources but leave the rest so it feels busy.
---
I'll definitely be using some sort of healing addon, but yeah basically I would like to be able to see all healing for all friendlies at any time... but above their head too haha
---
This is cool if you want to play with these specific people but there is only 2 pvp servers its pretty irrelevant if entire language specific communities join one of them it's still going to be English speaking.
---
How about I also get to pick my name early?
---
I mean it's one of their top choices so it could be.
---
Back to private severs lads!
---
I read you two's whole argument. Jenny, you're a fucking moron.  Boom, blacklisted.
---
Can confirm Blizzard are compulsive liars. They said CRZ would never be for current expansion zones in MOP, then stealth added it to all zones  during Legion(people thought it was a bug, too).
---
Blizzard said they ran out of time on specs in 8.0 and would fix them in 8.1, then in 8.1 they said they won't do any big class changes until 9.0 to not "Confuse people".
---
These are just two of many examples I can think of off the top of my head.
---
eu ?
---
Probably just practicing running the auction house. Seeing what works and what doesn't. Granted this is pretty stupid.
---
No, it isn't. It isolates the community on the server they're on, reducing social interaction and cohesion. Also kills immersion.
---
I highly doubt it would.  If you're still currently playing BfA, you're either bored out of your skull waiting for Classic and were only playing because you knew Classic had a release date announced, or because you have no real long term interest in Classic.
---
The people who are going to be deeply invested in Classic WoW (aside from perhaps streamers) aren't currently playing BfA, because it isn't the type of game that interests them.
---
&gt; No shit. It's irrelevant for PvE though, which is the reason why you give it to anyone who likes to PvP and doesn't mind throwing away several thousand gold on Sulfuron Hammer.
---
L M F A O
---
It's far from irrelevant. It's BiS for PvE until Naxx for Ret Pallies. It's also BiS for Warriors, but they have alternates they can obtain sooner than Ret Pallies. Like I said, you have zero knowledge of actual Vanilla. You're just spewing bullshit you read on these forums from other uninformed people like yourself.
---
Ret Pally utilities: Auras (every Paladin aura is essential in raid), Blessing of Protection and Lay on Hands (these two can save raid wipes), Divine Intervention, Judgment of Light and Wisdom, cleanses, and more. Not to mention in Naxx they're actually decent thanks to their damage against undeads, but you probably didn't know that either.
---
Get rid of your cancerous retail mentality of min/maxing and meta specializations. Yes, there are specs like Prot Warrior and Holy Priest that are best at what they do. However, you can clear every single boss in Classic with hybrid specs in your raid group. It's mostly mechanic fights and getting 40 people to show up to your raids. Out of those 40 that do show up, you'll see many hybrid classes including Ret Pallies. The great thing about Paladins is that they help their raids by going Holy when they lack healers and swapping between the two specs according to their raid composition.
---
Beats having to play upside down though.
---
OH NO NOW ILL NEVER GET INTO ANY GROUPS UHHHHG MY LIFE IS OVER
---
This decision was taken via a poll that was shared in facebook groups, discords, etc, afaik.
---
Btw, the chosen Br PvE server was Mankrik according to the poll.
---
You do that. I'm gonna just go ahead and roll on another server.

These are amazing. I love the duo that have him CC'd and still lose and yet they call him bad.

They literally said they prefer East Coast PvP and that Thalnos is off the table.

It's most likely Herod or Faerlina, with Whitemane still being a possibility.
---
Would that benefit the community?
---
Then no. 
---
The only reason this should be considered is well
---
Just search the word streamers in on this sub in the last 24 hours and you will understand. 
---
You just dont want them to do it because you think it is some entitlement issue.
---
Luckily stream sniping isnt against ToS in WoW, so snipe away!
---
Wow. Who cares if they dont get their names?
---
Because with this skill level people have now, it was too easy.
---
Its going to fucking be an emptyfest just like RETAIL if they keep this shit up
---
What’s he giant chicken reference
---
Did you get this to work on classic? When I turn it on it blocked all general chat completely.
---
This is what i miss about WoW. People would just talk more, communicate more. It made all the difference. I realised that not long after the group finder tool came on board, people just stopped talking except to insult. 
---
There is something about having to actually work to find a group and to meet up and run to your instance entrance and avoid enemies etc that just fosters communication
---
Gross
---
This post and the other picture are such incriminating evidence. Imagine talking about how great the community is and how it's the foundation of the game and then turning around and doing this.
---
I 100% agree, but it helps us more than them.

I'm really going to enjoy watching this clusterfuck turn into an even bigger disaster. There's no way any of this is changing 2 weeks outside of launch. Big yikes.
---
Herod will be Asmon's choice specifically because you don't want him there. And if you think he'll be scared off by a dozen or so people ganking him you're in for a surprise.
---
But it's literally not needed some people would rather Classic crash and burn than be inconvenienced trying to quest on day 1.
---
idk a game with a que im more likely to try than a game that looks dead
---
you cloud your point by making the situation more extreme than it is
---
both? and your answer proves it.
---
This is so fucked. They are not above anybody. Imagine being a streamer and being surprised that people grief you, that they corpse camp you or "steal" your name. \\
---
It's like having unprotected sex and being surprised weeks later you got a girl preggo
---
But I also stream. At what point do you say “you’re a nobody” to a streamer? 400 viewers? 100?
---
Exactly. The epic memories that could have been, from an intense launch will now never happen.
---
So, you are saying that the experience during Phase 1 is basicallyonly counts in community perception? There are far more people who are going to try out classic either after years or for the first time who may not necessarily want to wait hours on end to get into the game. Having access ingame is far more important to the general playerbase in today's gaming conteyxt is far more important than something like layering that may or may not reduce/destroy immersion (depending on the player). Also, not everyone will play on a PvP server, so that last point only really applies to around half the playerbase, if we are being generous.
---
Phase 1 "only" has the leveling as content plus Onyxia, MC and that's it. There is no honor system or BGs and hype can only carry PvP without any rewards whatsoever so far. That alone will be one of the biggest deciding factors when to launch phase 2, at least it would be for me and I don't even PvP. While I do definitely agree that layering could still have some annoying things fixed it will ultimately be there for a relatively minor part of the overall classic experience. If **you** are still playing 2 years from now I wonder if you will even remember how those first few weeks or month or so was with layering.
---
As much as I would like to know what server the streamers will be flocking to so I can choose a different one... Blizzard shouldn't be giving ANYONE preferential treatment outside of what they have already done with the beta invites.
---
Is there any bluepost that proves this or was this just a mention in one of the interviews? What stops them just straight up lying to keep outrage low...
---
It’s due to low pop servers?
---
Follow
---
How many people would every choose the version that isn't "Herod-1"?
---
There won't be hardly any wpvp on a pve realm. 
---
Most hardcore PVPers go horde, which is why the pvp servers favor horde. The hardcore PVE players tend to go alliance for Vanilla, so this is why the PVE realms favor alliance (with Mankrik being the horde-heavy exception for obvious reasons).
---
I can't choose a realm either. I'd like to go RP but the people I play with aren't RPers, so that led me to considering Pagle as an option but I'm also kinda meh about that, so I considered Grob too, but then I'm like, do I really want to deal with wpvp with no gains in p1? I still can't pick. -\_- On the plus side Grob has a great faction split...
---
jesus christ u kids are nuts is there any fucking way i can mute the word stream or streamer on reddit like holy shit get over it
---
"how is he popular? \*I\* don't like him"
---
He is 100% right.
---
Streamers getting to reserve their names early solves all the community outrage problems. People are too fucking hung up on it being about privilege to see it is a win/win
---
Ok so which streamers get to pick their names then?
---
Where do you draw the line?  At what point is a streamer not big enough?
---
The most controversial topic in WoW Classic is not operating properly in the final stress test ahead of launch and you want to downplay people’s reactions by being a snide asshole?!?
---
Sign me up bro, I’m with ya.
---
The Twitch app is garbage even for retail wow, I'm just going to install and update addons manually I think.
---
the amount of streamer entitlement is insane
---
agreed. end game is the last thing from my mind. my goal this time is to take it super slow and help people out.
---
Hmm that's what I was afraid of, oh well. Thanks for the heads up.
---
they have already deleted quite a few very valid threads about layering today. lets hope they are exhausted by now
---
Yeah their fan art of Whitemane is... about what you'd expect to come out of 4chan.
---
They might have a hard time proving stream sniping. Maybe a stealthed rogue was acting as a scout the whole time, and they use discord to report location.
---
I think it's laughable that a big streamer would even think they can lord over a PVP server. Their whole approach to this is backwards.
---
The only problem I have with the mouseover macros is it will take up a ton of bar space to have ~ 3 ranks of each healing spell on my bars.
---
How surprising.
---
Rogue 60
---
Rogue 52
---
Mage 60
---
Warrior 35
---
Druid 35
---
Warlock 35
---
good plan. Herod could be a streamer realm though. The only confirmed non-streamer realms are Fairbanks and Thalnos so far. 
---
I was going to pick one realm and have 3 characters (one per each class I will play).
---
Do you have a Costco membership? I think this should be able to run it fine:

Getting both Dal'Rends is definitely harder as a hunter than getting Savage Gladiator Chain, especially considering that hunters can farm Ring of Law solo. If I were you, I'd swap those items' relative position in pre-bis and hardcore lists.

The way I view it is that it is pretty straightforward if you follow the basic mechanics... but very punishing if you don't.
---
Question
---
&gt; Classic is dead. There was never any intention of making it work properly.
---
This is just ridiculous and you know it. You think blizz wants to make a shitty mechanic that ruins immersion. I get that you are upset but come on
---
We don't have concrete numbers, be we can easily extrapolate from historical data and private server activity.
---
8 Servers in the USA is a ridiculous offering, let alone the 2 in Germany and Australia.
---
[This one](https://willitclassic.com/view/ArWqoZcdf451m7temv7u) seems to show possible spawn locations on the map but I don't think there's one to notify you of a nearby rare spawn. The guy in the clip was mashing a macro to /tar The Rake it seems.
---
Obvious.

Only well known streamers who will impact the server environment.

Why dont you articulate why you think its a bad idea.

The kobold quest reward that gives you two candles to shoot fireballs from just helped me beat a lvl 12 mage in a duel as a lvl 10 pally :D
---
Block asmon, asmons, asmongold, asmongolds, asmon's, and finally asmongold's. Boom. Solved. Rinse and repeat for every streamer on your server
---
Imagine thinking you deserve some just because you stream. Piss off.
---
well, how the fuck does layering help with that? especially on lower populated servers where there's going to be only one layer in the first place? sharding players from different servers together i understand, but what does layering do? as i understand it its only purpose is to not overcrowd zones early on.
---
Obviously I don't. I'm asking what is the appeal? What makes people like this guy?
---
Dude no. Can’t you see? There has never been streamer entitlement. It’s all been made up this whole time. Lol they are so delusional.
---
Ah, wasn't aware of that, that's unfortunate.
---
Yup thats pretty much the dilemma, unless we just mb duplicate every realm, like whitemane 1 whitemane 2 and then later merge them idk. I dont think blizz is really considering this enough though.
---
If you dont think big streamers fuck servers, you aren't watching them enough.
---
What are the downsides to playing the underpopulated faction on a PVE server?  For example if I rolled Horde on Pagle, which by the recent survey is projected to have 75% Alliance and 25% Horde, would it really feel like a ghost town or would I be less likely to see the effects of layering early on and have a more classic-like experience?  
---
And then later on if the overall population drops significantly, how is the raiding scene adversely affected by relatively fewer players?  I've only ever played on healthy servers or as the overpopulated faction.
---
keep crying for them
---
Testing addons etc.?
---
And Herod is likely to be the biggest US PvP server.
---
Most people dont want streamers on their servers.
---
So if they roll on Herod, they better be ready to get stream sniped and corpse camped as soon as the stream goes live.
---
I think the problem lies is when an extra player joins the frey, his interactions must be processed against all other players in the same area.
---
The required processing power goes up exponentially, hence I can see why the servers simply can't handle it at a point. The client side isn't that bad because your client doesn't need to process others interactions, your machine simply gets told what actions just happened and also sends data to Blizzard about an action you may have just done.
---
The only way Blizzard couls fix this is by implementing smarter code. For example, you could say if player A is not within 40 yards of player B, then don't process attack interactions between players A and B. Obviously doing stuff like this though can make up for some buggy interactions.
---
This is why Blizzard uses layering, kind of a necessary evil in my opinion.
---
Blizzard lacks creativity. Hence why Classic is more popular than this zombie they have created
---
Just a small spanish population it seems to be. I wouldn't really worry about it.
---
I grouped with a mainly spanish speaking gnome mage on the last stress test. We had a bit of a language barrier, but got by with simple phrases. We grouped up to do a red level quest and ended up hunting treasure chests together for a while. Was quite fun!
---
They're Austrailia so they're upright - what they're watching is upside down from their view
---
Streamer don't just beta, they are beta.
---
No it doesn’t. No changes. Vanilla wow didn’t have special snowflake name reserves for people that play video games for a living.
---
It depends on what you want out of this game. If you're going to level slowly, stopping to smell the peacebloom and tank some 5 mans...then go right ahead. This is the best way to play the game imo.
---
If you're going to go hard and get into a raid guild with hopes of clearing end game, then i'd level ret and go holy to raid. If you find the right casual raiding guild, you might even be able to raid as protection, as a support/OT.
---
I'd change passwords/etc just to be safe.
---
They are great at aoe tanking in 5-man dungeons, but you won't get a raid spot as one since you can't taunt.
---
not even remotely what I said. learn to read ffs.
---
TBC.
---
I have tomorrow off and am seriously considering buying a subscription just to enjoy it for a few hours...
---
I never realized it blocked generalchat for me as well, always have it off in retail so didn't even think of it, it blocked for me as well, hopefully they will update for launch with a fix, no idea how to fix it now, sorry :(
---
That's what I've seen people say. I read it in [this comment thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/covmek/mfw_someone_asks_which_us_pvp_server_will_be_the/ewlx3ga?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x). Granted, the Spanish-speaking Latin America community is only like 3 entire servers in retail WoW, so I doubt they would have too much of an impact. But still, thought I should include it!
---
As a brazilian, I can confirm that too. Hope we all have a great time in Azeroth.
---
PS: No need to gIeB mE mOnI, okay? cheers!
---
Answer the question. How many viewers do you have on average? You want to know if you should get the same opportunity, then answer the question.
---
Why not just put them up from the get-go? It's a huge launch...
---
You're failing to grasp how severe it is. Layering will ruin the material market for the entire length of Classic, not just until it's removed. The rare vendor recipes will be ruined for the entire length of Classic, not just until it's removed. Layering even just at the start will negatively effect things that will last forever and remove experiences that we can't get back.  
---
Professions aren't going to get tons of new recipes every content patch, there aren't going to be new materials out in the world, there aren't going to be new outside zones, there isn't going to be many new quests out in the world aside from unlocking the new raid content.  
---
The launch content is essentially everything we're going to get aside from some new instanced raids and instanced PVP which funnily enough, wouldn't be affected even if layering stayed.
---
You wont have that helmmon launch day lol
---
Yea yea yea. We know. Blizzard bad. Retail bad.
---
Why are you crying bro?
---
You are correct, they just removed this post as well.
---
US East Drama
---
US West is fine lol
---
What kind of a person cares that someone else relists items at the end of a stress test?
---
I mean nochanges has always been a shit stance from the start.
---
Making a good game is always going to be a better option than keeping stupid and clunky shit in just because it was there 14 years ago.
---
At this point just make fucking channels. One of the coolest things from the Korean MMOs is picking which channel to play on to avoid other people. So why not just pick a layer instead of having it switch for you
---
Lol you so triggered. I’m not even American lol. Typical mate from down under chip chip cheerio shrimp on the barbie lol. Terrible players get quarantined to OCE servers lol.
---
Yay! Thanks for the confirmation. Can’t wait to explore
---
Then released the dumpster fire that is BFA after hyping it so hard.
---
1. Names are valuable to them, they built their brand on them. 
---
2. They probably will be right there at launch time and get their names.
---
3. If they don't then they can reap what they have sewn. They are no different than Thex. They can afford to pay someone for their names if they don't want to just make a new one.
---
4. Wake up call: the beloved community are all trolls. Lol streamers say they don't think griefing will be an issue but they know someone will ninja their name just to grief them.
---
Thanks.  Casts Fort.

I plan on creating a Dwarf hunter and then taking the tram in Iron Forge to Stormwind as I like the areas better. Are there any class quests or training specific to being a hunter where I’d have to go back to Iron Forge for?
---
This is a strawman.
---
You know damn well who we all are talking about.
---
Classic content creators and streamers.

Not some dude with 100 viewers streaming from his moms basement.

You're missing the point

This Sub:

Streamers are assholes they wont announce what server they will be on.
---
Streamers: OK we want to ensure we have our names, so blizz can you allow us to reserve early so we can inform the community where we will be at so they can avoid us
---
This Sub: WTF StReAmEr PRiViLeGe STREAMERS ARE SUCH ASSHOLES..
---
Bunch of petulant children the lot of ya.
---
Life isn’t fair, streamers are more important to blizzard than you are. Deal with it.
---
You're doing a bad job of making your case by comparing apples to rice.
---
are you having an aneurysm? do you need us to call someone?
---
launch day cant come soon enough. changing my race/class choice every day.
---
did it? guild wars was entirely instanced
---
Maybe you should be seen in an English class then.
---
Imagine thinking Blizzard will cater to your little power fantasy. PVP servers aren't going to be what you expect bud.
---
Frankly if the classes weren't such hot garbage and unappealing to play it would be a decent expansion, kinda.
---
You guys need to understand that they can all play on every server if they want and there’s nothing any of you can do about it.
---
Good talk.
---
This is gonna kill the whole experience, if it stays like this.
---
&gt;Because you're acting like an ass and most people don't do that unprompted.
---
I know ur crying and triggered cause of that.
---
OCE were the Brazil servers before Ragnaros became a thing. They’ll be crying about ping and no players as usual.
---
meh, dont see it as a big deal. I dont want my chars to be named Esfand or asmongold. Only people that want it is trolls. Just give them the names, doesnt mean fuckall to my gaming experience. 
---
On a sidenote, people should chill on the streamer "hate-threads". I know you dont want to play on a streamer server and all. I dont really either. But painting them as some form a cancer to the community is silly. Streaming is amazing publicity for the game, and for every twitchchat fanboy they bring, probably 9 other "normal" players come along, growing the community further.
---
should probably just cancel thie game then....
---
ClassicCodex is shaping up to be a completely better version of Questie. My only question: is the data complete for all zones, obscure quest locations, 1-60 at this point? Couldn't really tell from using it in the stress test.
---
You probably argue the best thing about Classic is the community and then say stuff like this
---
If you want to pvp and raid, priests are one of the classes that needs the most respeccing, especially if you want to go shadow for pvp. Enchanting/tailoring won't make you money unless you sell bags and some min/max enchants (i.e. Crusader which is super rare/expensive), so you're better off with two gathering profs IMO. 
---
Engineering is great for min/max pvp, but it is expensive to level.
---
This really concerns me. One of my favorite things about Vanilla was seeing the same people running around all of the time, sitting outside to duel for a while, seeing a thriving world...
---
&gt;i wont be able to (enjoy classic) even when classic hits 10mio players
---
for the slower people:
---
i think the influx of new classic fans can change the game for "vanilla recreation" to "something that looks like vanilla".
---
that means playing classic is fine, but it might not be classic anymore at that point.
---
should have specified that for you. my bad ;)
---
Seriously you and me both, lol
---
Yeah, that's fair. I bet it wont be as bad as it looks in the Gif all the time. The chat spam any time a streamers name is mentioned does worry me still. There was another gif where a streamer walked into a main city and trade was taken over. It's like when someone mentions Murlocs or Thunderfury but worse.
---
cares enough to make a post on reddit about it lol
---
?????
---
Do you think that sitting dead as a ghost for a few hours is good content??
---
He wasn't saying that anything was prevented. He said that social interactions in games meant more. It's literally in the bit that you quoted...
---
I’m not missing the point. I’m asking you a question and you can’t answer it. 
---
Don’t comment back unless you have a real reply. You honestly can’t just expect them to pick certain streamers based off twitch views or however YOU decide is a “streamer”
---
Hope so
---
Doing something that's been done a million times before is clever now?

Over simplification of tool tips was what made me really dislike Ion. That and he seems to be fucjing tone deaf to basically everything that isn't  a praise.

"We enjoy playing the game, that's good enough" - Developer that charges a monthly fee for a game they are building for themselves
---
Do you not think they won't also have an army of fan boys healing and cc'ing people around them as well ?
---
Good luck buddy I can't decide either and I have to before name reservations tomorrow. :| 
---
For me, it's between Pagle (PvE), Bloodsail Buccaneers (RP), and Good Old Grob (RP-PvP). I like RP realms...but the people I play with don't care about them, so I thought maybe Pagle, but idk... I want my RP but I don't want the community to be worse for me rolling there with non-RPers...if that makes sense. I thought Grob might be a good compromise (might be more exciting than a PvE realm and I get my RP), but hhh... I dunno.
---
haha, shit it feels shit to be correct. did they give a reason at least?
---
This is what I don't understand. People who actually understand the classic experience realise that a messy launch actually sounds like chaotic fun. If you want a "perfect" experience play retail.
---
When streamers ruin classic
---
Dams dude I remember back in WotLK hanning like 20 just trying to do the torch glitch to get under stormwind
---
&gt;I think if you advocate for no changes, you shouldn’t be trying to get your special name saved.
---
Like these guys started petitions for no changes. The fact you keep trying to say this isn’t special privilege really blows my mind.
---
But I guess you don’t want vanilla wow.
---
This might be the most retarded flex I have ever seen
---
more servers ready **in case we fill them up**
---
They wont be open before name res
---
This sub reddit is filled with wahbabies
---
Anyone is pro-layering is a shill. Anyone anti-layering is a troll.
---
There, now we can all be confident that anyone who disagrees with us can be safely ignored.
---
I don't really care about things being vanilla-like, I just want a good game.
---
I'm pointing out the hypocrisy.
---
No they didn't.  There have just been 10 more posts and so you're further down the screen.
---
It's really hard to tell. Right now, it's complete for private servers since that's where it pulls its data from. I have been notified of 2 quests right now that don't show up as "available", but once you pick them up, the addon behaves correctly.
---
I actually loled at this
---
follow the above tip if you're hoping to get yourself suspended or banned for misusing the 'report cheating' system
---
They are ending it at 9am pst
---
&gt;Exactly, classic opens to each timezone at midnight so EU gets to play before NA
---
What? Classic launches at midnight CEST which is 3PM PDT and 6PM EDT so if anything the American players get earlier access as they can log in and play for the entirety of the 26th as opposed to someone like me who might have to push it to the day after because maybe I have to be up early on a Tuesday.
---
&gt;It’s obvious blizz servers can’t handle big influxes of people.
---
Overwatch had a simultaneous global launch and that worked pretty well, so did BfA and there we had like a couple realms with some issues. 
---
Blizzard has done simultaneous global releases before and they can do it again.
---
They want to feel powerful and like they can force streamers to do something.
---
Spoiler alert: they aren’t and they can’t.
---
Lol.  Those terms are upheld by Blizzard.  Good luck getting them enforced. They aren't going to ban these guys for stuff they've already been doing on retail for years.
---
Update to 1.1.0. Added the below section to options window
---
[Even more](https://twitter.com/Alexensual/status/1160694717232898048?s=09)
---
Drop bear murders are up 200% this year.  And that's not counting the unsolved deaths in the outback which might be drop bear attacks but the bodies are too mangled to tell!
---
So you do think twitch viewers is the way they should decide on how big someone is? Why not YouTube subs? What about people that don’t stream on twitch? Why twitch views?
---
But there is no good that can come from layering, having to start the game 3 days later because of over population in the starting zones would have been a significantly better result than layering which will ruin the starting experience, the economy, the value of having a rare vendor recipe, the value of rare spawn items/monsters and other things forever. You can't undo the harm layering will cause in the first few months but a congested questing area will eventually be uncongested.
---
You can oneshot anyone with a few pompyro mages and invis pots.
---
" You think you do, But you dont"
---
How would he be violating any TOS by simply having a following and switching servers?
---
or uhm, remove layering?
---
They said it was a repost. However I disputed the removal and they have now reapproved it. Here was their comment:  
---
"Typically, layering is removed under rule 7. In this case, your post provides something a little more substantial."
---
Yeesh... Battlegrounds are going to be a pain on Bloodsail Buccaneers... but I rather play with lore nerds.
---
Anyong!
---
Horde-Fairbanks is where it's at fam.
---
Yea dude. Totally flexing. 
---
????
---
&gt;(barring severe performance issues obviously)
---
the fuck you on about? the game came out in 2004
---
You're making less sense by the minute, bye.
---
Yep, I was gunna be a priest, then warrior, then mage. Now I think I’m gunna roll warr for sure ... lmao. Who knows what I’ll be tomorrow!
---
its war
---
thats it
---
Update to 1.1.0. Added a minimum bid values by slot section to Options tab.
---
How do you save on server costs if you are still supporting the same number of players.
---
If anything the cheapest solution is to have no layering and just leave people dealing with massive queues at launch.
---
You had one job Blizzard.. I'm not even surprised.
---
&gt; I defended it and after this stress test I’m done.
---
The what?
---
&gt;stress test
---
Oh the TEST to see what the thresholds need to be to trigger a new shard being created?  The very test they're running to ensure this ISN'T an issue at launch?  That test?  The insane doom and gloom predictions of this community do far more damage to Classic than sharding ever will.  Blizzard isn't doing all this with the intention of having the game fail, that's not how a business works.  It's how internet fanboys with no grasp of reality THINK business works.
---
Might be blizzard PR doing damage control
---
As I've said elsewhere - Layering just because starting zones will be flooded at launch is not a good excuse. Doesn't that sound fun to anyone else? It is a massive, chaotic, one-time event. Why does everything have to be perfect? That mindset is what ruined retail.
---
you wanna max gold run to the AH and start, that's the best way. anything you do out in the open world will not be as effective, you do those things for fun.
---
Xperl, at least, was vanilla - I used that, and I stopped playing before TBC hit.
---
Is selling arrows/bullets not a thing?
---
I normally play a Nelf druid but going to give Horde a try this time so this is going to be my home!
---
Npcscan if it gets ported correctly
---
Horde or alliance? Age?
---
Yes it was: https://i.imgur.com/4ohpyB9.jpg
---
ok weeb
---
&gt; i think the influx of new classic fans can change the game for "vanilla recreation" to "something that looks like vanilla".
---
&gt; that means playing classic is fine, but it might not be classic anymore at that point.
---
Just to clarify, you think it's a "vanilla recreation" only if players that have played the game before play it? **The original vanilla experience was what it was because everyone was new**. "New vanilla fans" literally describes the original vanilla playerbase lol.
---
Alliance. 24.
---
According to the mod they are:

Yeah that makes sense. Forgot about wowinterface and the older sites
---
Yo, I've got a guild brewing with about fifteen members. We're planning on doing a little bit of everything, including PvP and raiding. Supportive group, all over 18. You use discord?
---
Yep but, I played on Nostalrius, we had 14k people online sometimes (chinese primetime hours), but it was laggy as fuck, and unplayable. People always forget that part. 
---
When they announced the shutdown, we were like 4-5k people online, so imagine if everyone was there. 
---
What a crazy adventure it was, Nostalrius Begins.
---
I keep seeing this but it’s always the retail players flinging insults and insulting private server players for just wanting a faithful recreation of there favorite game.
---
If I’m wrong please show me.
---
Then do that. Show me the numbers. I'm sure Blizzard is interested as well, since they came to a different conclusion.
---
Probably going Golemagg only to avoid the longer queues and shit. Shazzrah is way too cool of a name to not be super popular.
---
Being serious, what does that even mean?
---
"through out that play session"
---
This is such bs.. as soon as you log out and in again, you are assigned to a different layer. The point of vanilla community is that you dont need to think about sharding, because there is no sharding. Everytime you log in, you see the same people around.
---
Sharding ruins everything about a community.

What Auto-attack addon is that?
---
The real questions: only 2 eu pvp servers ?
---
But EU had a huge queue on the main realm and a ton of ppl on it. That beta statement does not translate to a stress test very well.
---
Because the amount of views doesn’t matter. The fact that it does comes down to views is my whole point.

But sure. You got me. I’m a 10 or less viewer streamer.

Almost every two minutes, over and over and over

Yeah, there's a reason /u/sbowesuk is the top comment and this guy gets downvotes.  Because he didn't simultaneously pull a whataboutism and shit on people who don't want to play with streamers.

Cause essentially by playing on Herod were killing our first-born son's, by not pursuing wife and kids.
---
Someone took parts of it and created zperl. Its fairly similar.
---
how far is blizzard cock up your ass?
---
Or maybe there was little to no point to being in a capital on a level limited stress test.  I certainly didn't spend a lot of time in one.  There were, however, loads of people out and about in the two first zones.  Lots of chat in general.
---
Is this honestly an issue for you?
---
Tell your friends to roll on the same layer dude.
---
no one is talking about start/starting zones ... problem is too big population one week after
---
Hey everyone,
---
I have never played WoW as I never had the chance when it was first released and then never got into it. I am seriously contemplating playing classic wow as I am an avid warcraft fan (the rts).
---
I am just afraid that everyone on the server already knows what to do and how to play and it will be difficult to find a helping hand if and when needed. Or that I will go some class that is useless in the endgame and feel like I wasted a lot time. I would like to know what the community thinks about a newbie like me.
---
Also any advice, tips etc will be much appreciated.
---
&gt; I know for certain that people won’t play if they keep it like this.
---
Some.  You know for certain SOME people won't play.
---
What are some must have add-ons?
---
I heard some people were planning on making a community ranking for toxic players on one of Esfands cast. Which Esfand correctly pointed out could be abused by streamers or fanvoys to ruin people's experience.
---
So probably some website, plus other streamers
---
I say do it if you think it'll be fun! I'd heal a pally tank in dungeons, nbd. Just try and learn about your class and be good at what you do and I think you'll have a good time!
---
Nice, sounds pretty decent. I'm 24 and use discord.
---
Because they don't really care about avoiding streamers, they just want to "beat them" because they hate them.
---
IMO if youre opinion of Blizzard is that low, you should just a avoid WoW competition. I know I wouldn't pay for a game if I believed that the creators were knowingly lieing to me about their plans.
---
How do you know that Shazzrah is more popular for English-speaking people?
---
10secs CD is dope. You can kite, pop it, eat and re-initiate in style and top off anywhere in BGs. Plus as a priest you can bait people for a quick fear.
---
Haven't heard anything in particular about Fairbanks to mention. Seems like it could be a nice choice! :)
---
You are both right and both wrong. Is "of the Owl" better than "of the Eagle" for Priest? Sure. But is "of the Eagle" better than the white/grey that was probably occupying that slot beforehand? Also sure.
---
A lot of unknowns, but you can join us in the discord as I'm sure we'll be talking about whatever happens. [https://discord.gg/fuu9bAh](https://discord.gg/fuu9bAh)
---
No way to tell. We won't really know till release or maybe the week after.
---
Layering basically allows for the server you choose to consist of several virtual servers that exist dynamically. A packed server in Vanilla had around 2-3k players, if we can trust what people kept saying about the server caps over all those years. At the start there will be far more players. 
---
So, let's say there are 8k people on your server. The layering allows, at least in theory and as far as I understood it, to have a far bigger amount of players active without the need for probably hour long queues, as a part of those players will be put on a layer and therefor virtual server. It's basically instancing but it puts the whole continent in an instance. Instead of having 8k people active at the same time on the same overworld, you now have 8 layers/virtual servers/instances of the overworld with 1k players each, making the overworld actually enjoyable and not an endless waiting and tag game as it was on certain big vanilla pservers released in the last few years.
---
And when the hyped up player numbers eventually die down they can remove layering. It's definitely more effective in the long term. I remember the warlords of draenir launch with 6+ hour queues. I literally turned on WoW, logged in, went to school and came back to find myself still in the queue on the day after the expac launched. Having that now in addition to overcrowded servers where people are unable to properly level their characters is far more harming in the long run to blizzard than it is with layering and them garnering possible short term hate.
---
Views (or subs as you also mentioned) translate into influence. It’s free publicity.
---
The fact that you are a 10 or less viewer streamer and you think you are as valuable to Blizz as Asmon or Soda is actually laughable. It completely defies logic. If you don’t know that, you’ve got some hard truths to learn.
---
Yeah I don't get where people get this from, we had like a couple of realms that had problems but BfA launch for the vast majority of players was perfectly fine.
---
Section 1. Park B, Article ii:
---
You may use the Platform for your personal and non-commercial entertainment purposes only
---
Streamers by definition are using the platform for commercial purposes.  Their very existence is a violation of the ToS.

I mean he's playing it up but he can't control his community.  Chat is going to be just like he said.  Everything he does is going to be spammed across the server.  If he's in a zone, that zone is closed for any kind of realistic content.
---
I’m from the Midwest and I’m totally down for this guild!
---
People think he's funny, imo he's got a lot of good takes about what went wrong with WoW and what can be done to improve it. A lot of people just sorta see themselves in him too where he's kinda just a normal sorta bum gamer. He likes to lead different community events and people really enjoy that and from what I've heard from people who have played with him that he's actually a really nice guy and down to help people. He's not really one of my main streamers I watch so I honestly don't really know him a ton but the hate boner for him is certainly more curious to me than the fan club

Better get to a bowyer for more ammo!

It won't be bad. My suggestion would be to have the mage do most of the CC, and the pulling, and then the rogue can jump in and attack/stun/etc while the mage finishes the mobs off. The mage never takes damage but probably will hold aggro, the rogue rarely takes damage, you have free food/water going around... I think it'd be a good time, especially because you're playing with a buddy.
---
Ah damn, we're horde, just saw your other comment. Good luck tho!
---
Why is he obviously kidding? He has no life. His life is literally to game full time and cause drama. If he’s bored and clears all phase content... why not roll an alt on a new server?
---
we're \~cool&amp;mysterious\~
---
yep...
---
"That Priest just attacked me! I took so much damage!"
---
This cracked me up
---
I mean you're here making challenges and rolling on my PVP server so just someone to look out for
---
Why do the anti-streamer community think they influence the streamers decisions? as asmond said yesterday, he will play where he wants because he wants to and crying reddit/general forum babies isn't going to change that 
---
You people are better off waiting to see what server they choose and avoiding them because it isn't going to happen the other way around

Now that we know what patch we will be playing on is mage or hunter going to be a better solo farmer? Still trying to decide between the two and def going to take that into consideration.
---
My guild will give bonus dkp for killing streamers

You should consider that a "stress test" is meant there to test things out. Maybe they tried some stuff that didn't work and now they know that? Stress test is not a "this is how launch will look like sneak peak", it's a fucking stress test.
---
And yes ofcourse if there is issues with layering then they need to fix it, big surprise!
---
There are videos...
---
What kind over person are you that this is your experience with other people? Ive been playing wow from vanilla to pandaria on german servers and never faced any of this. Just some self-loathing manchild trying to blame it on everyone else.
---
Me and some friends are planning to roll on the streamer server. We're going to powerlevel a couple of hunters to 60. Then we'll streamsnipe and lock the streamers down.
---
Aww dang. Thanks and you too! Perhaps I'll see you on the battlefield!

You can just leave that area... it's no different than if you got camped by an enemy.
---
Absolutely true. Of all the names you listed no one speaks up about layering and server state in general.
---
They could be making a difference but they don't.
---
Let me guess you also think you deserve the same VIP treatment as actors and athletes, right? Because you’re a big important man damn it, and you are special too!
---
Honestly, I wouldn't mind to much if they just wanted phasing at the start like they claim. I just don't trust Blizzard-Activision at all. They've lied too many times.
---
And I think if we just 'accept it' that will 100% guarantee it's here to stay through phase 2 and beyond. The only way phasing/sharding/layering will ever be removed is if we make a huge fucking deal out of it every chance we get. The bugs aren't even the part that worry me. The bugs suck, but even if they were all fixed by launch (And they wont be) layering would still suck. 
---
My issue with layering has never been the bugs, it's been the entire core concept of sharding and the impact it will have on my community experience.

Names are exclusive to server names.
---
Is that really so hard to understand?
---
This. I am all for this.
---
I would think most experienced tanks would be line-of-sight pulling when necessary. Makes it a lot easier.
---
Right people have been breaking the ToS by streaming for a decade now, someone hurry up and ban these guys already!
---
Streamers aren't going to be getting corpse camped on a pve server. 
---
That is the point.
---
So its less of a thing you'll do and more of a threat 'if you come to pvp servers, your experience in the open world is going to be shit'
---
Fair enough, but Blizzard chooses not to enforce that because streamers are free advertising. Even the toxic ones are free advertising. No such thing as bad publicity as they say. It sucks. I wish the rules applied to everyone but it is what it is.

Mate just go over to the private server subreddit. I won’t link it because I’m not sure if it’s allowed but just google reddit wow servers. The amount of fighting, shilling, scamming etc in the scene is insane, retail wow is all about fanboys but this is moving into illegal activity type of shit.
---
or you make to s of reddit posts about it, mods remove the posts, report it and nothing happens
---
The sky is falling but you have no evidence, no data, no numbers, but just believe me!!!!
---
Materials are going to be insane. There will be a higher concentration of people "power leveling" (which now in 2019 will just be called "leveling") professions. If supply is just insane due to layering (it wont be) it will be met by an insane demand. People will attempt (and maybe even sometimes succeed) to abuse layering to get a black lotus, and it's still going to cost a fortune for one.
---
Recipes are mostly rare spawn drops (instance), raid drops, dungeon drops, or rep grinds. Layering does almost nothing for any of these. 
---
The bugs suck, but the concept of layering is fine.
---
Private servers are going to end up having more of a community than Blizzard servers.    
---
The current devs are incredibly lucky they have weaseled their way into Blizzard and ended up working on WoW and have so many indoctrinated players still playing with their time lost fallacy because if they had to make money designing their own game they would all be living on the street.    
---
I don't think they have made a decision in the past 6 years that has helped the game apart from going back on their own terrible design decisions or re-hashing something they had previously removed.
---
Bringing attention to it is also pretty helpful
---
This definitely kills the hype.
---
EU is where Forsen is. The single most toxic community of all the streamers since Ice Poseidon left twitch. Enjoy.
---
I can't tell if you just didn't /s or if your trolling.
---
My favourite thing to do on PVE was use a Voidwalker to round up a tonne of mobs, move them close to the hunter bot and either wait for the mobs AOE attack (if it had one) to hit them or for a hunter ability to hit the mobs and get aggro. Then destroy the voidwalker to drop it all on them. Kill the bot and go back to farming in peace without competition... for a while at least.
---
With TBC it briefly got even better because for a while pets would not disappear whilst flying so you could just look down at the ground and move the voidwalker around to grab mobs from all over without any risk to yourself.
---
Didn't they say it's just turned up to 11 during the beta and will be toned down on release?
---
In an optimal scenario where no one is competing, which is unrealistic
---
yes, if you do the skip the level does not matter
---
look for Menethil harbor to dun modr skip in youtube
---
There's a mega thread in this subreddit for addons that tells you how to do it. Search for that!
