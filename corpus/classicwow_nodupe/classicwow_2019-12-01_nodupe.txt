oh yeah lets have lv 57 kill lv 60 without the 60 being able to do anything!
---
---
---
I understand how it affects PvP and those people are right.
---

---
The dude I replied to was implying somebody will come out with this excuse for chat delay which has nothing to do with it and he just wants to shit on people.
---
&gt;exactly like how a warrior is expected to be able to tank if asked. 
---
This entire thread is about the fact that *they weren't asked*. In fact, they clearly state in their post that they would agree to heal if they had been asked.
---
Some people already did when the BGs were announced, small group mad is much lesser of a problem than a larger leaving.
---
Actually with WSG you'd now be able to guess easier when players are hiding behind the mezzanine area above the flag when you got to collect. The reduced range is actually a plus because it won't confuse it with players outside the flag room.
---
Loot council.
---
Does goblin have any BoP?
---
I had to scroll way too fucking far for the first person to point out that this is a ridiculously misleading post.
---
Why? I think you underestimate the importance of identity people have for their characters.
---
[removed]
---
What mistakes our tank doing or how he can do it solo?
---
You'll probably die a bit more than other classes, generally because Warriors don't have any real escape buttons, especially if you are new to the game. 
---
You can mitigate this by sticking to green level mobs and quests (the estimated difficulty of NPCs in the game range from grey, green, yellow, orange, red and skull) and picking up gear that can help you (training Bows, Crossbows and Guns and using one of them to range pull mobs safely, there's a quest in the Badlands that rewards a trinket called the Nifty Stopwatch, Alchemy can be useful in being able to craft your own potions, etc.)
---
You may want to look at playing a Combat or Sword Spec Rogue as well. Rogues are technically more fragile than Warriors but tend to have an easier time leveling due to the tools that are available to them. 
---
Warriors are a fun class, though, and just understand you're going to be a little slow going compared to other classes.
---
Horde have
---
* Stronger pvp racials
---
* Better flightpaths (Badlands and swamp of sorrows are 2 of the best farming zones in the game, both horde only fps)
---
* They can stay in non-neutral zones until lvl 42.
---
* intercontinental transportation has guards
---
* Near all streamers play horde, and even shame ally players
---
* General stigma against pvp as an alliance player
---
* Easier to get those sweet pvp montages for your 8 viewers if you are the hunter, and not the prey.
---
yeah don't worry about that, if the game dies due to blizzard's negligence i'll just move onto something else.
---
i'm almost positive you'll still be crying bitching and whining about the 37 different reasons you can't play this game because it's not catered for you. it's strange for a guy to be so emotionally invested into a game he doesn't even bother to play outside tuesday.
---
Sell it.
---
I play there, just checked census, says Alli has been sightly favored the entire time... So you're wrong? I got camped for an hour + in silithus trying to do my MC quest. It's just your bias
---
I would change the no honour buff you gain after flying and extended it to just after you Rez. Would make killing give a DK. However if you have the buff and you attack you lose the buff.
---
I would have put a limit on one sided population, so if there are too many horde, new accounts can’t create horde characters. Would force you to another server or roll alliance, keep a max 60/40 split.
---
I agree with him and if you want, you can hop on Grim Batol EU to come say hi ty my 15 year old hunter :)
---
Poly can only affect one mob at a time. 
---
Frost Nova and Blink are really their get out of jail options, along with Ice Block later on.
---
you are allowed to break that rule for only $15 per month.
---
Gnome is ok cuz of the cast time. Even then it's nothing great. 
---
Dwarves really only have a get out of blind free card. But half the dwarves don't know how to use it properly 
---
Ud getting out of fear is tons better than both of those combined.
---
Does anyone know what Noggenfogger-EU is like as a server? Is the faction balance good, and does it have queues?
---
It took me abandoning 4 level mid-40s to figure out how amazing normal servers are and I played on pvp servers for 15 years.
---
Theres not even less consensual pvp... just a whooooooooole lot less/zero ganking and griefing.
---
It's where I ended up.  Having a great time again.
---
They are allowed to PvP ... it's just that - under my changes - if you stick it out and PvP while outnumbered, you get buffed for doing so.
---
The issue is that, in the current system, players who are outnumbered on a server are stopping playing on that server, leading to imbalances becoming worse, because continually fighting in the minority is not, in fact, fun for both sides.
---
Glad to hear that! :)
---
In general my server has been a shitshow, and I've been extremely frustrated about it. However, it has the side effect that because I can't play on my main that much I've been able to level my alt (just got 40 today hurray!) and pvp on my alt has been a friggin blast! I haven't had this much fun in a long time in WoW - running around farming xp/questing and being the biggest asshole I can possibly be when I see the opposite faction. So far at these lower levels it's been nothing but 1v1 or 1v2 and it's been absolutely amazing. This is the pvp i love - fair, unpredictable and fun!
---
My favorite part of the day was when two mages around my level killed me on teo occations which sort of made me get into my "I don't care anymore - from now on my only mission is to make it a living hell for them". I killed them so many times that I made one of them log into his lvl 60 main to come and keep me away from them lol. It's been an absolute blast!
---
Ask around in trade, world, or city chat!
---
What's your server?
---
Then you aren't part of the target group because I worded poorly. He is saying people who picked horde to pvp should reroll alliance, because they are not currently pvping.
---
even easier to be a dickwad with.
---
This is exactly how I remember vanilla though, is "bugged" really the word?
---
I asked for #onechange and was met with a brigade of hate and downvotes
---
It really was not always like this, not even close. When these servers are multiple times the population that a vanilla server could even handle, your comment is immediately invalid. I played vanilla in 04-06, not private server mimicry. This is _nothing_ like it was.
---
Vorosh of Kor Kron?
---
It really bothers me that the summary of people playing what class adds up ro 101% at the second picture
---
Those are quite mediocre since you actually have to be alive to use them. The night elf wisp spirit remains BIS for this phase.

---
Honestly wait till 10th, keep in contact with some people from the server and check the sub.
---
It could be better but might as well save yourself the money incase its ass.
---
The book in question looks slightly different compared to the others. Those others that ran in and out were probably aware of this and used the visual clue.
---
To be fair TBC dailies were tame in comparison to retail. It was the beginning of a bad trend though.
---
Im literally in a guild named mutiny that formed because of a mutiny. Westfall-alliance btw :)
---
My two (and only) big complaints about TBC: Dailies and flying mounts.
---
If I was Horde I'd still probably kill you for those names.
---
You're sacrificing 2% hit for a net gain of 8 attack power. Not worth it, in my mind.
---
Yeah. I think you're agreeing with me?
---
[close enough?](https://i.imgur.com/zgFMU8e.png)
---
In what way do I suck. Like literally or metaphorically. How dare you insult my intelligence
---
"But you miss out on 50% of the game!"  - the pvp player who can't pvp or pve due to constant griefing or the horde 60 player camping level 30s for 6 hours.
---
Normal servers are where it's at.
---
Stop it Polishrob.
---
This is the way.
---
I mean realistically they will have 3 options: quit, try and keep playing through it, or reroll on a different server. If blizzard adds paid transfers (which I don’t think they will) they could escape the server but it would screw the server even kore than it was
---
I think saying they aren’t comparable is a stretch. The might belt, legs, shoulders, and gloves are all replaceable with better damage items and only losing a little armor and stam. 
---
I think that’s very comparable.
---
Oh please it’s what everyone does no matter the faction or server. My server, alliance is the larger numbers and they are just as much asshats as this. When people are part of the overwhelming mob, they all turn toxic
---
Same lol
---
Point and laugh at the people who thought that the idiotic baby-killing of ganking servers would actually be sustainable.
---
Minority factions are either going to leave for where their faction is in the majority, or reroll on a normal server.
---
Majority factions are going to whine about how there isnt any enemy any more.
---
I unsubbed due to the Hong Kong incident.  I haven't logged into any Blizzard game since then.
---
I hosted a Gnomish Death Race on Old Blanchy and it went pretty well.  HMU if you have any questions!
---
No one remembers buzz aldrin
---
"Hopefully" lmao
---
when they tell u that u think u do , but u don't , this is what they mean
---
don't come back to retail tho the place is better than it even were without u trash mid 30s no life losers , u don't deserve better than classic , stick with it to the end.
---
“At least he had chicken”
---
14? Try 23 deaths to get into BRD the other day.
---
&gt; a quest item you can turn in in Stormwind
---
FTFY
---
Just hit 49 on thunderfury, trying to figure out what to do besides spam Mara
---
Same LOL
---
Of course massive raids fly into BRM... they are going to MC and without a raid you just get picked off and lose ony buff by the horde who sit there all day to get their 5 honour per kill.
---
Lmao ok guy
---
Sulfuras is the fuckin tits!
---
Can’t wait for bgs to come out though so I can level alts again.
---
It's nothing like the first month where everywhere was swarming with people but it's still much more populated than it ever was in vanilla.
---
Did you LIVE TO WIN!?
---
Horde side on Earthfury is pretty reminiscent of the alliance side on every other server. Horde are corpse running to dungeons. I am level 41 and spent most of my 30s dead. Thanks Blizz.
---
No you didn't get a BG with 14v15 bots, that's a blatant lie.
---
I wish there was a swift ban to all the bots. That way I could report you ingame and get 5+ of my buddies to do the same because I don't like you. Blizzard would ban your account immediately because 5+ players wouldn't just lie would they?
---
You have no idea how big the botting business is and how many accounts get banned between bot ban waves without them announcing it. 
---
We've even had quite a few players on this sub getting perma banned and whining about it. Blizzard knows botting hotspots and ban loads of accounts just not the minute you report somebody.
---
I got it off witch doctor. When you've been doing the GY to level have you been killing witch doctor? How do you solo that boss as a mage?
---
Well that was... Hah?
---
This might work. Outnumbered buffs have been Implemented into some Realm Vs Realms games, bit sure how effective it is.
---
good, thinning out these players will be healthy for the community as a whole. Play a pvp game, pick a pvp server and bitch during a sole pvp phase..... on top of that, the majority of these players would've spent the last 13 years bitching at blizzard how they ruined world of warcraft for hand holding and turning the game too casual. asmond can take his basement dwellers and hide back their shards
---
How about it working both ways? Or just making a lvl60 receiving no HK from anything below 60, and also nobody except another lvl60 receiving HK from killing a 60. Essentially giving them their own bracket, like it is with battlegrounds.
---
Thanks! This is all great advice. That macro will be very useful.
---
Have you tried 2 manning Arena runs in BRD, soloing DM:E on a Warlock, soloing ZF on a Mage, or 25 manning MC? These all require both intelligence and skill. It's like this thread's OP said, much of the fun in the Classic experience is self-directed. You can solo farm turtles for golden pearls, farm professions, and 40 man MC for mindless gains, or you can take advantage of the Classic sandbox and push your own limits.
---
You should win this providing you don’t get pummelled and gear is similar.
---
Also engineering really helps in this match up, with a grenade stun you can either get a free heal or chain lightning. Or even using the net trinket then it’s definitely a free win (providing you don’t net yourself)
---
Worth it.
---
People cheat at school and it doesn't take away from my degree?
---
Paying real money for wow 2k19 LULW
---
Use isboxer
---
Alliance have better PvE racials and pally buffs are far superior for clear times than WF. Blessing of Salvation alone is better, plus BoK makes it no contest. Looking at the PvE population splits makes this apparent.
---
i agree, if its your first 60 its a good experience, after that it becomes a chore unless you are lvling something fun such as hunter or lock imo, people who dont already had the experience of leveling wont be able to afford boosts
---
Because people who farm the devilsaurs will hoard more (to keep the price high), or fewer people will farm the devilsaurs. The quantity that makes it to the auction house isn’t the same quantity that gets created (spawned then farmed). People can keep stuff in their banks or mobs can simply not be farmed.
---
I've been able to use Spy to target players just as they enter stealth, and still have them targeted for a second or so. I think it's typically when someone stealths as they pop up on Spy (like rezzing + stealthing immediately). If you click their name fast enough, you'll have them targeted for a second in stealth, and could send a pet after them if you're fast. I don't know if Vanish would prevent this or not.
---
But yes, in normal circumstances, a player would have to send their pet after a visible rogue, then even if the rogue goes into stealth the pet keeps coming (unless you use Vanish).
---
I think the game can survive 10 more days of steadily declining world pvp activities
---
They rolled out DM early too and the game was doing just fine then. 
---
A bunch of people are upset but that has been the case this whole time. I see plenty of alliance on blowmax so I'm not worried.
---
Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity.
---
WoW is about gear.
---
The problem should go away with the release of battlegrounds. The problem is the difference between vanilla and classic - the consistent flow of new players. In vanilla, the faction imbalance would even out because of the constant influx and this temporary flux in wpvp camping would be miniscule in the grand scheme of things.
---
But, this is classic - the consistent influx of new players is limited to alts and casuals. The faction imbalance is a negative feedback loop and the historic growth is no where near matched.
---
Hopefully the introduction of BGs allows things to settle, but it is what it is at this point.
---
And buff night elves! 
---
Give my my aimshot from stealth!

Amen! And that it did decent threat generation as well.
---
I have foreseen the future, and in it, there are! And their eyes glow blue.
---
You are not wrong! Druids are definitely strong in Classic PvP.
---
&gt; buy DM tribute staff 
---
Or you know, just run the instance yourself for it at that point?
---
*shrug* Blizz could try it as an experiment on a server, and see if more of the outnumbered faction are logging in per account subscribed than on other servers.
---
This would cause major griefing. You could use low levels to make groups "invunrable" to those who care about honour.
---
In my honest opionion
---
The crazy part is that the constant gold selling spam on chat just shows me Blizzard have absolutely no effort put into making it "secure".
---
I will go play hello kitty world and cry myself to sleep.
---
If you don't want other people rolling for upgrades you should reserve them.
---
Legit, and this may suck, but its worth rerolling PvE. Lots of nice guilds/folks are actively recruiting all the PvP server migrants atm so theres lots of people to help you get going quickly again. The atmosphere is 100x more chill and you can just relax and play the game, which is nice.
---
Maybe level another class that you were interested in, to keep it fresh?
---
In short. Guildie hunter joins to help our healer get his healing mace, Chest drops after a few hours of farming BRD and said hunter decide to need as the person has not recived T1 yet and this is probably one out of like 5 items she ever won.  
---
RIP 4xx runs now for 4xx more!  
---
Also i know it is a bad thing for hunters to take it over a warrior as myself but an uppgrade is an uppgrade after all so i am not mad at said hunter for it. A bit dissapointed only.
---
Staff of the Ogre Magi is WAY better.
---
We've all kissed your sister
---
You think you do, but you don’t.
---
That's just a shitty group. Spec doesn't matter if your group can't pull properly.
---
Won't be an issue because I'm on arcanite reaper
---
Incendius alliance here. It isn't balanced. I cant land on most FPs without 5-30 horde instantly boning me. I died 11 times between TP and UBRS last night. This has become the norm. Most alliance just raid log now because of it so finding dungeons takes hours.
---
I think it works well, I can find whatever I want and I don't have to think about it. Mostly it's just about finding a system that works for you. I offered my system just as an example.
---
Unfortunately just spawning the right book is random and you may have to open wrong ones just to get it to appear.
---
You fell for his edit lol.
---
You do not need to switch targets for mouseover macros either, it's basically the same thing.
---
Who?
---
I got a DK yday and was googling for a while to find out exactly what it does; while there is explanations on google I haven’t been able to find any numbers or math.
---
All I got from this post was a person telling me getting across from one continent to the other is now considered End Game content. 
---
Move along Horde poster. Move along.
---
Still, never could gank NE druids, shadowmeld flight form was another class w/ bubble hearth essentially.
---
You want to charge &gt; hamstring anyway. MS is after.
---
That sounds like Blizzard
---
As a raidlead/guild lead, you can always tell who's trying and who's not. Of course not everyone has to have the most optimal gear and things, but you also don't want to reward people who are clearly just not trying over people who really put the work in.
---
Surprised the mods havent removed it. Probably too scared after the backlash they got last week.
---
Normal? Nah. Better? Probably. If queues are bad, rankers will just fly to WS, EPL, WPL, etc to continue farming HKs during the downtime. Classic's PvP system is just inherently busted like that.
---
dont think there is a solution that will work dor everyone but heres what i would do:
---
-open several new servers (both pvp and pve)
---
-enable realm transfers for everybody (1 free each month)
---
what will happen is this: 
---
-every supressed group will leave pvp servers to pve (mostly ally)
---
-horde palyers will find out that their actions killed their server and they will move elsewhere
---
repeat untill servers will balance themselfs
---
Why blizz wont do it? a lot of players will quit. but less then is quitting now. pvpers sill still have BGs, pvers can pve in peace. only the ones who enjoy world honor farming ganing will leave
---
Be careful bro, if you ever dare try and insinuate that classic raids are easy compared to m+ you’ll get brigaded by the “patch 1.12” mob.
---
go back to retail!
---
oh, nvm.
---
Its HonorSpy lagging us out. As you log in it creates 3 channels in which it communicates a boat load of info every few intervals and every death. Combine this on thousands of people at a constant rate during peak hours... And no, you dont need to use the addon to stop having lag, the other thousands of users will make this lag for the whole server.
---
I started healing in retail using Healbot. In classic I switched to using just mouseovers. Mouseovers is just as easy as using Healbot, with some very small pros and cons of each different approach. 
---
Healbot pros:
---
Lots of simple left-middle-right click actions with shift-ctrl-alt modifiers. All your healing/dispelling is happening by some combination of clicking their bar in the addon.
---
Healbot cons:
---
Healing now requires an addon. Addons can become broken, out of date, and unsupported. I don't want to rely on 3rd party tools to do my fundamental job. Also all the healing functionality doesn't extend beyond the addon which means you can use the same healing setup to heal people not in your party/raid, aka healing people in world PvP is the most uncomfortable.
---
Mouseover pros:
---
Native functionality within the WoW client, never gets broken because of API change. Works for parties and non-party members. Very easy to use... just over over someone's party frame or hover over them in the world and hit the key of the spell you want to cast. Very easy, just as fast as Healbot.
---
Mouseover cons:
---
You need to make sure you have binds for all the spells you need. I use like 8 different healing spells and all the other ones too. If I exclusively used Healbot for healing, then I would have a ton of free keys to put other binds on.
---
Kalimdor = 60+ content; classic+ is here!
---
You must play horde -- I just spent over an hour trying to get into BRD from Morgan's Vigil.
---
Don't really low hp players give shit for honor?
---
I originally started on one of the supposedly most populated pve realms of EU as alliance with an alliance majority, but rerolled on an averagely populated pvp server as alliance with a horde majority. Censuses can say whatever they want, but the difference is night and day, the former was a lot more barren, and I really grew tired of it.
---
 On the flipside, after P2 came, the game became totally unplayable, so there's that. You can choose  between realms with shitty population and nary a group to anywhere, or being unable to do anything because the constant gank groups.
---
With pocket change and 2 balls of lint i got lying around
---
Or wear plate like a warrior is supposed to lol
---
Why'd you pick pvp if you can't take being ganked?
---
It's not fun. Look at anyone actually grinding honor (for example, Staysafe)... It just really isn't fun, it's just unfortunately the only way to get the rewards at the moment.
---
Yeah, absolutely. Any system is liable for corruption. I'm just saying, as a warlock who over compensates to do well on logs, I would be LIVID in a DKP system if a pally got a mageblade over me.
---
Stack agi/str/stam.  Raw attack power is good too.  Rockbiter until you get windfury.  Don't underestimate the damage lightning shield adds, keep it refreshed.
---
&gt;It literally alerts you to stealthed players who aren't even using abilities like sprint or whatever. There is nothing you can manually parse in the combat log that will alert you to a stealthed player nearby, its 100% cheating.
---
Yes there is... If a person enters stealth near you it will show up in your combat log as X has entered stealth...
---
Yeah but you can kill people quicker, don’t even have to fight just one shot. Makes honor gained faster overall
---
Its thanksgiving weekend take a breather even devs need a vacation.
---
I've been testing PVPing at different times the last 48 hours and counting when the honor does/doesnt count.
---
After today's roll over at 4:20pm PST, I can confirm the following:
---
**Honor DOES count from 10am to 420pm PST**
---
**Honor DOES NOT COUNT 4:21pm to 1am**
---
They appear to have moved the previous "Dead zone" that was 3am to 8am to now cover 4:21pm to at least 1am, if not later. 
---
Additionally, the players in the past that pvp'd during the dead zone of 3am - 8am confirmed that the honor that dissapeared did not just go away from their daily roll over - **BUT NEVER WAS CALCULATED ON THE WEEKLY AS WELL**
---
Images of honor last 24 hours:
---
* - 11/29 honor 6pm to 830pm - https://imgur.com/a/4DXlPfH
---
* - 11/30 honor the night before + pvp from 10am to 4:20pm BEFORE ROLL OVER - https://imgur.com/a/XhECEbe
---
* -11/30 honor AFTER roll over - https://imgur.com/a/cI9i7ml
---
You need main tanks?
---
Yeah with that attitude
---
Just make a realluly long post on Reddit.
---
What a bullshit app
---
Yikes
---
Because then they'd have to actually learn how to play and not rely on op racials and the zerg to back them up.
---
I started phase two at level 50 and while being a Druid allows me to avoid a lot of Ally groups hunting me down, if I get caught I'm pretty much instantly dead. I'm level 58 currently and only just now acquiring my BiS. I'm a resto spec wearing almost entirely cloth so as you can imagine I'm a prime target in a lot of open world skirmishes and easy prey for any rogue who lays eyes on me. I've lost count of my corpse runs at this point.
---
But I've stuck with it, because this is exactly what I wanted. Neutral towns are now warzones, danger lurks around every corner and even once-quiet Horde cities and outposts are under siege by the bloodthirsty Alliance. It's annoying at times sure, but the satisfaction of teaming up with other players to liberate our cities is worth it, and quite honestly it's made the world more immersive and exciting to explore in general.
---
We thought we did, but we didn’t.
---
That’s way worse as hand of justice isn’t even very good for hunters. SGC is fantastic and pre raid BIS.
---
What's your point? Anyone can download and use spy just like any guild and download and use DBM if they aren't, that's their choice to PvP at their own speed.
---
Join the servers discord and 99% chance they got recruitment stuff there.
---
What a nice answer, thanks!
---
UD getting out of fear, means less Alliance warlocks.
---
Less Alliance warlocks means a drastic imbalance in the PVP metagame. 
---
One side has a get out of fear card, that basically translates to a reduced presence of fear for everybody even the non UD.
---
PVE is really the only other choice beyond just quitting.  Throwing away two months isn't enjoyable.
---
mage should just sheep you if you fap...
---
Thats what they are saying
---
The addition or lack of spy would change nothing about me as a solo pally questing in terms of avoiding 4man ganks. At least I can see them coming with spy.
---
Twink items might be worth purchasing before bgs and selling after bgs
---
In what sense? It’s inferior in every regard with the sole exception of 10 FR, you were it for FR fights (all 2 of them) and then use wrath for literally everything else.
---
or just sheep you and reset...
---
They have to be in your line of sight and within range in my experience.
---
Lol I forgot what questing was like, must be nice to be able to do it :(
---
Thank you Dookster, you put a smile on my face with this kind gesture.
---
Or they could not
---
Ah yes, of course...
---
I played on a pve server from wrath to mop. Even when horde took over nesingwary last night and corpse camped us for 20 min I was having a blast. We turned the tide and did the same. If you're on benediction I can probably guess who you are lol but keep it up I love the competition. And I won't make it easy for you.... Unless you're the one lvl 60 rogue that kept stun locking me lol
---
Earth fury. Server is 90% alliance 10% horde. You will never be able to do anything in Winterspring. Period. The alliance own the zone all day every day and groups of bored alliance roam the zone 24x7 looking for horde to farm. I transferred there from Faerlina Alliance and left. It’s an Alliance PVE server now.
---
I know what i'm doing when i get home from work haha..... Jks gotta get those levels.
---
There’s a threshold you cross. Being over 10 points in weapon skill under a mob adds an additional 3% to miss.
---
Something interesting seems to happen on servers in the \~60/40 range, sounds like its true of benediction, and very true on my server, Whitemane….
---
The situation is conditioning horde and alliance to play a bit differently to maximize their honor if they are ranking, and even just to optimize regular casual or pve gameplay. Horde is encouraged to farm honor solo, or in very small groups, because there is not enough alliance "traffic" for big groups to be efficient. Alliance rankers on the other hand can find plenty of horde traffic to justify big groups, and so that's how they farm honor: in groups. 
---
This trend rubs off on non-rankers too because solo alliance trying to get to their dungeon are juicy treats for the horde rankers, but their whole dungeon group of 5/10 is solid protection. Horde who just want to get to their dungeon safely can group up and it is a little bit safer, but if they run into an alliance deathball they will die regardless, so they are more likely to be travelling solo. 
---
The faction imbalance is small enough that the alliance style of always being grouped is able to mitigate or even overcome the numbers disadvantage, and so people can perceive both sides as the more dominant faction or perceive it as balanced, or anywhere in-between.
---
Holy shit... I rerolled on Earthfury because I couldn’t deal with this shit on Heartseeker. I haven’t logged on in a month (I quit) and it’s sad to hear that’s happening over there.
---
How accurate is that website?
---
Shaman don't replace until AQ either btw for those on Horde
---
yer this is the case on arugal as well. its the most ironic thing. who would have thought that #nochanges would be the biggest change of all. classic aint feel like vanilla, its a fucking nightmare. they really should have kept layering in for faction balance. You never had 50,000 people servers in nilla, you never had efficient honor farming en masse in vanilla. world pvp in vanilla was fine in retrospect because it wasn't done efficiently or by the masses. world pvp in classic is literally killing the soul of the game. gj making just another version of retail
---
I mean, yeah. Except for all the changes. 
---
But #somechanges just doesn't have the same ring to it, eh.
---
He also has lips that taste like cherries
---
lol ok? the fucks any of what you said matter?
---
you don't like where the game is now. it's not surprising the servers turned into shit for anybody with half a brain.
---
brm, neutral towns, and fps were always camped in vanilla. it's now amplified tenfolds because the population is tripled in a world not designed to hold so many people. not to mention most, if not all of the population are now metaslaves rushing to rank up.
---
why are you still here giving blizzard money? and even worse, plan on giving them more money for server transfers? we both know the players aren't going to fix this themselves. your whiny ass is probably going to hop over to a alliance dominated server and pretend there's nothing wrong there. blizzard clearly isn't going to do shit but they'll gladly take more money from morons showing how unhappy they really are.
---
pretty sad you can't just be a reasonable person and not play a game you dislike. instead you resort to whining on the internet and justify this to the fact you have 2 max level characters.
---
you're the only delusional one here.
---
55 so far with no drop. :/
---
Taking longer isn’t difficulty lol
---
Rogues are literally affected more than any other class with this addon
---
The WHOLE point of a Rogue is to get the jump first, which Spy gets rid of now
---
Keep sounding ignorant though
---
Yes, but imagine how much more it happens to alliance. Instead of every 10 minutes, it's literally every 10 seconds in popular zones.
---
Exactly. Gives the players A chance to prepare for A fight, call out for help from allies/clan members, or A chance to leave via flight master instead of being instantly deleted.
---
Ya how dare the alliance keep their guardless boats clear.  Obviously every one should always port everywhere all the time...
---
Super useful post, thanks dewd
---
&gt; I've been playing since the TBC pre-patch on a pvp server and everything you guys are experiencing I dealt with 12 years ago. 
---
Utter bullshit.
---
I noticed u stopped at the level they become honour for lvl 60s. Smart man, ive seen so many quit at the big 56-60 grind, or grit their teeth while they slowly eek their way there. Good luck.
---
There will be 0 reason to return. At least with a character on that server they have at least some reason to try and stick it out.  And if they transfer they are actually affecting two servers balance instead of one.
---
Lol anyone can learn how to do any of these fairly quickly , They're not exactly hard.
---
Honestly even in raiding you don't need any except maybe DeadlyBossMods. The blizzard raid healing frames is perfectly adequate.
---
Fuck it mate enjoy the game ride. Do in your own time, enjoy everything. 
---
Don’t go for this end game retail fucked up mentality that has been for years in this game.
---
It’s not the damage, it’s the slow from frostbolt that would cause the mage issues. You’re right though, detect helps you to avoid reflector but a smart warrior will wait till the frostbolt is mid flight before popping reflector.
---
You act as if people aren’t already going to gano more anyway. :&gt;
---
You literally said if you "wanted to PvP" you would go do BGs
---
You can do BGs on a PvE server without ever getting ganked lol
---
Inb4 mutiny of mutiny
---
I can attest that last night,  while desperately trying to find a group for brd. I watched for 1hour 30 minutes (timed it with in game stop watch), in ghost form , 15-20 horde farming the crap outta the inst entrance. No response for alliance. Just free honor from anyone trying to get to brd and any trying to reset their dungeons. 
---
Initially the pop census said close to 50-50. Imo the balance shifted in the past few months and now with people either transferring off, raid logging, or just quitting IF is pretty empty. 
---
Maybe I’m biased since I’m on the receiving end of this but I can trust my eyes. Try hanging around any neutral goblin town and count the horde vs the alliance that pass through. To my own eyes it looks completely skewered to horde.
---
You don’t get honour for killing greys - is there a level difference?
---
It definitely used to be! They recently opened transfers from a few large servers (one being Faerlina) and now it's very alliance favored. Guildies and world chat are also experiencing the hour+ run through BRM
---
I can't think of another add on that gives nearly as much of an ingame advantage as spy gave.
---
Thank you :) didnt know what id be getting in to been a long time since ive played a healer in a game
---
33 alliance warrior here... ripperino de ripperlino
---
Blackveil veil from brd is an option.  Got sick of strat aswell
---
I hate it when the 60s come in and interrupt our low level business.
---
Lets hope not!
---
We found a tough guy!
---
lol,should we tell this moron bgs are out in a little over a week? dumbass lmao.
---
Factions aren't deciding to keep your from playing the games, it's different individuals deciding to gank you a few times.
---
This is a great idea!  Blizzard just needs to add a 'passive mode' button somewhere in the UI (probably on the talents window on the bottom right)  l and make it only possible to toggle when in orgrimmar  (or stormwind for alliance)
---
Basically the same as on Zandalar except inverted. Particularly with the Blackrock dungeons you have to allow for 35 mins of corpse hopping becfore you plan to start.
---
reroll to PVE and mercilessly troll the WPVP people who start posting on here about how the WPVP servers dead and the queue are too long.
---
Spiral is still one hell of a weapon! Miles ahead of people running around with Doomsaw from Rend...
---
Or he can just be an adult and say “I don’t want to heal” or just heal anyways for the sake of getting on with the group.
---
And if you do that, guess what, you'll have no guild. Even if my goal were to hook up me and my friends, fuck everybody else, the best way to achieve that would be to endeavour to keep as many of my raiders as happy for the most time possible. Lower player turnover = higher loot retention = less time for people to get their Azuresong Mageblades and DFTs. You can't slather you and your clique in sick raid purples if you have no raid.
---
TL;DR the best way for a big mean loot council to hook itself up over a sustained period of time (imagine ruining your reputation by going full greed goblin on MC gear) is to be extremely fair to everyone.
---
I mean yeah, besides the weekly mc when you run to the raid together, you can’t really do anything right now... at least within a reasonable timeframe
---
deal withit.
---
I feel shame whenever someone of my own faction does this after a good fight.
---
Found the stupid one
---
The noob tears are certainly flowing. As bad as it is for server population... I fucking love it.
---
DON'T TELL HIM WHAT TO DO
---
Both faction queue and faction transfer at the same time would help a lot though.
---
just accept my poor life choice of rolling on a pvp server on the lesser faction because friends.
---
Even tho i knew this would happen and i will keep my stock of invis potions topped up so i can get past most of swarm.
---
There is the “yellow attack queuing reduces offhand miss chance” argument, which is somewhere in the warrior discord - https://discord.gg/RbCZJtw.
---
It would be easier to pull off with a fast oh and slow mh. That’s all I can think o, but is very major
---
As long as it doesn't get too vulgar it's all fun back and forth
---
My guild requires it because it allows for faster clears and less chance of error. We require about 30-40g worth of consumables for 1 night of raiding. If you can't be bothered to put in enough time to farm 40g in 1 week, you probably shouldn't be raiding. Every class can get that in like 2 hours tops.
---
I rerolled from Mirage a few weeks ago, because contrary to the population numbers on paper, the realm felt extremely barren, not a soul in sight ever, and even less LFG for parties.
---
Ya and tbh most of the complaints are from people who are on original servers who refused to switch once overpopulation and what/not was already known to going to be an issue. 
---
I honestly have no sympathy for people on Herod or other servers that were very clearly going to have issues from day 1.
---
sorry you can’t change my mind. i already saw your post and am convinced that classic wow is dead.
---
'horde poster' based on nothing.
---
you opinion is discarded for trolling and trying to argue from genetics.
---
Remember the blizzard knows more then you post? I hated that post so much seeing as how I've been playing on and off each expansion....and I've seen the incompetency grow year after year.
---
The alliance player was clearly out-skilled. He could easily have used Tears of Elune in combination with Recklessness to beat down the Shaman and Warrior. To deal with the mage, he should have contacted the cyber police to get his IP and hired a DDOS-service located in China to lag out the mage; the mage would be there as extra rage if need be as well as an intercept target. Get good and stop complaining about pvp on a pvp-server fucking alliance scrub.
---
Alliance got the best race in the game in tbc though....
---
thank you for your service
---
Hah, there was a guy from Norway in my (NA) guild for a while. Dude would be running home from a party at 2 am to get on for raid time.
---
Yeah it's a joke that people want sympathy for getting camped as ally but when you try to say same shit happens leveling as horde they laugh. I can't play the game in open world as a solo horde either. It's the 10k players more than the 70/30 or w/e
---
And when BGs are released and the servers are imbalanced then the long que time will keep those players out in the open world farming questing/farming players with the side benefit that many of the people who may have been able to push back against such a thing or come to help will be in BGs and not able too. Lack of BGs is a problem, yes, but it is not the only problem nor is it the major one. When BGs are reduced wpvp will diminish for awhile until players figure out which is more efficient honor farming. For Alliance it will likely be BGs, for Horde it will likely be small group wpvp.
---
Omg this is so true everytime I get gang ganked then I get to gang ganking it's the best!
---
have fun doing your dailies on retail :)
---
And yet, here you are
---
Same. My friends and I all leveled to 60 as Alliance on Stalagg. It's currently unplayable. All of us have quit for the time being. 
---
 I'm hopeful things get better after WSG and AV. If not, then what a massive waste of my time. I don't have it in me to start over on a different server, so I'll probably just be done with the game.
---
bye friend
---
Well a lot of why it doesn't, is because you don't get the extra threat gen from defensive stance.
---
Bc sm/ruin is quite solid and very viable for raiding. I’m the only warlock who can keep an imp alive every boss, so I’m sm/ruin and don’t wanna swap weekly
---
I would rather be able to hunt down guildies and still play with them than drop them all together, and overall there are way more horde than alliance so it's a safer bet for long term. I just don't want to start over, really.
---
Would be interesting to know, of this effects everyone on a similar level. Then it would be totally even

---
It's the opposite on Heartstriker. The free transfers absolutely killed the realm. 
---
We got all the alliance refugees from the big German realms. They're now doing the same thing with the Horde.
---
You actually think Dal Rends out dps BRE?
---
Very good movie
---
You can also see "by Makta" at the end of the line though.  So we know both names.
---
Is not really even. Some folks play early in the day and some play later. It's either a display bug or people who play after 0:00 GMT and before midnight server time are screwed.
---
Yeah, I guess I can understand that.  It treats it as a constant "You're always doing *something* just by being in stealth" even though realistically that makes no sense.  You aren't actively *doing* anything.  Its not like you go in stealth near someone and their combat log starts exploding with a flurry of "PLAYER USED STEALTH PLAYER USED STEALTH", I assume it pops up once, and gets lost in the action assuming you're doing literally anything else.  Without spy, most people would miss it very easily, hence the "it provides an unfair advantage" argument.
---
#nochanges 😂
---
And that's a problem why? It's not classified as an exploit.  It's the same as getting the Marshall's fury buff.  Not intended for raiding but not explicitly denied either.  If you don't use the mechanics available to you, what are you doing attempting a speed run?
---
You run into other players in bfa? I tried it for a week and felt like i was playing Skyrim.
---
Are not shamans one of most op classes in pvp?
---
Sorry I didn't specify, I meant anything to progress, whereas trash isnt something that counts towards the progression of the raid.
---
Also yes
---
dw everyone is quitting anyways so they’ll find another cash cow
---
Orange took one in the belly, who bright that Madman Mr. White
---
Expand on hunters being fixed. You do know they were this broken in vanilla, just only .01% of players knew their true potential and they weren't rushing to YouTube to make tutorials.
---
I used voidie to 60; don’t leave auto cast on, he’ll Oom too fast and you’ll get aggro pretty soon after 2 taunts anyways.  
---
Also, you should be using food/ water every now and again too, maybe after. 10? Mobs
---
Dynamic respawns are a vanilla thing ...
---
Bruh....do you know how trash hunters are? Private servers did hunters better
---
They were going to but people complained that it wasn't classic so we get a month of this.
---
1. By your expectations and assumptions. That's about it. 41 US and Oceania realms. 43 EU realms. Another 7 between Korea and Taiwan. And your expectation for the minimal staff working on classic is to review all of the Botting reports from 90+ servers, have conclusions made and bans administered within days? I'm not saying blizz can't do better, they could absolutely hire on move some more people to Classic. What I am saying however is that, given the reality of the situation, your assertion of *"They are in a position to ban obvious botters within a couple of days."* is presently incorrect. 
---
2. You've a loose definition of cheating. RMT is cheating just like botting is cheating. Cheating is only definable if there are rules in place. If there's no rules then there's no cheating. So in this case, the ToS of Classic is what determines someone is cheating or not, not you feelings, not other game's ToS, only Classic ToS. RMT gives someone an **unfair** advantage that they otherwise wouldn't have if they played the game as intended by the Devs. Seems pretty **fair** to me to ban RMT's and Botters alike. You like fairness, right? Well, you did a few posts ago....
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I tried, but you seem pretty dead set on this issue and if you stay true to what you've said in this thread, you'll  be quitting the game because of the actions of a very small percentage of players. It's unfortunate that you let such a small group of people live rent free in your head and dictate your decisions. I play WoW to have fun, and the reality of the situation is that 1-2% of the playerbase being bots does absolutely nothing to interfere with my fun having. It could if I let it, like you, but I choose not to. Bots will forever be apart of WoW. Blizz will continue doing what they've historically done and send out bans in waves. If that's enough to make you want to quit, I've gotta question what makes you even want to play Classic again in the first place?
---
Are bots unethical and cheating, again, yes. Should they be banned? yes please. 
---
Am I going to quit because the Devs aren't doing their job as fast as I want them to? No. 
---
Am I going to stop doing something I love because the actions of a fraction of the community. Fuck no. 
---
Everyone is different though I suppose, best of luck to you.
---
I want vanilla back, not this blizzard shitfest
---
Yup, I bust that out first wrath after execute phase starts. Gives you ~20 seconds to do the last 15-20% of the bosses health
---
Most LCs do try to act fairly and in the best interest of the guild, but the problem is perception on what is "fair" varies depending on who you ask.
---
My guild runs LC with a weekly rotation on some spots on the council with fairly simple distribution ideals - we try to rotate upgrades through members so everybody is getting items, with the only caveat being only 3+ MC attendees are eligible for big ticket items (i.e. weapons). Last raid we lost our class lead Mage (I know, class leader is a very defunct role in this era) because he disagreed with what was "fair" when it came to our first Mageblade (no staves yet either).
---
It would be a big change though, and would take away from the fun of temporarily "capturing" (Not camping) enemy territory.
---
Benefits and drawbacks to every solution unfortunately. Hopefully BGs + Faction balance + lower populations will be enough.
---
He waited for his party to get there so they could all get the honor.
---
Look no further than the front page of r/classicwow, fren.
---
ert does this
---
Ok boomer
---
I think it has to do with the fact that during actual Vanilla there were not nearly as many people on the realms, and Blizzard fucked up letting Alliance leave higher pop realms that already had slight imbalances. So now servers like mine, Fairbanks, are so lopsided and terrible that you seriously can't get anything done. BRM from the Searing Gorge flight path all the way to every instance portal is camped by groups of Horde. There's little chance of making it to the instance within a half hour to 45 minutes of landing at the flight path.
---
This is all causing more and more alliance to quit or reroll Horde. Making the faction balance even worse. Blizzard had the information prior as well considering what happened in Live. We're on the exact course for faction dead PVP servers where nobody with a brain rolls on the screwed side by the time BC servers hit.
---
THEY DONT GIVE A FUCK!!!
---
I’m sure have missed something. Why are people leaving?
---
You know, the reasons you give for faction queues being unfair are the same things alliance is experiencing now. Horde is barely inconvenienced at the moment so why not make it more fair with both faction queues and faction changes at the same time. So you can actually switch to play not switch to die.
---
Whats going on?
---
Unfortunately as a druid, my taunt doesn't even force the target to atk me.  It literally does nothing if I already have threat.
---
Just wondering when being this petulant and not acknowledging mistakes became the norm? I don't think it was being mean, insulting or condescending but maybe someone else sees it differently? I'm the red and the guy put me on ignore then started insulting me so i couldn't respond. Was rather amusing but wow... this was just a new level i experienced today.
---
Dynamic respawns = vanilla
---
Ok....
---
In the time it took me to reply to you informing him about the time it took him to type out some shit, I took a shit.
---
Quit, there are regular horder raids on IF on my server, super not enjoyable.
---
Yeah devilsaur is still incredibly good even if you don’t need the hit rating. Luckily hit rating isn’t completely wasted if you’re over the cap as it helps with glancing blow damage. 
---
Just keep in mind that a human rogue bis is going to be a little different than other races. Assuming you’re combat, all you’ll need is 1% extra hit rating after the 5-5.5% we get from talents. So devilsaur can easily fill that gap, even if it’s a slight overkill. 
---
Other pieces that are going to be bis if you don’t need hit rating are eye of rend instead of mask of the unforgiven, shadowcraft shoulders instead of true strike, etc. Plus you can buy the belt and bracers like you mentioned.
---
Yes, the add-on that makes my minimal a square was definitely based on combat log scanning at superb man speed.
---
Bro take a break go see yer family they miss you it’s okay if you don’t rank this week
---
You feel better?
---
I've been saying for weeks all I want is to be able to transfer to a PvE server. I'll even go to Mankrik just for you, snookums, since its Horde heavy. Not that it matters.
---
Until then, I will continue to raidlog and opine about the absolute disaster that Classsic has become and you'll be right here arguing about it with me, either claiming that everything is fine or that its my fault to begin with. So I'll help you.
---
Yeah, I fucked up. Lemme transfer or eventually I will just unsub if BGs don't alleviate this. Which is more important to you: Classic failing miserably because the Alliance all quit or being right? Because Horde sure seem to care more about being right and feeling smug than the game not going down in flames.
---
So everyone would hang out with him?
---
Totally depends.
---
If you go arms;
---
At level 21(?) sweeping strikes+cleave allows you to kill 2 mobs faster than you can kill 1
---
At level 30 intercept allows you to kill a bad mage/most other classes
---
At level 32 Berserker rage allows you to kill priests/warlocks much easier
---
At level 34/36(?) sweeping strikes+Whirlwind allows you to kill 3 mobs easily, as well as hugely higher killing potential because instant attack.
---
At level 40, mortal strike increases your burst potential through the roof.
---
You might as well be a different class at the higher levels your play style changes so much
---
Macros change the class a lot also - having /startattack in your charge macro means you get an instant attack when you charge in, if you don’t, it can take 1/2 seconds to get that first hit off.
---
Also, charging and intercepting critters/mobs through the world can reduce your travel time ALOT, but yeah it is still pretty rough.
---
Lol calm down it's a video game
---
*waves from the horde side*
---
Is &lt;Molten Core Swim Team&gt; a raiding guild or just a joke name? Because I *love* seeing that guild tag.
---
Found the scrub
---
I've heard many people say it's allys who have the pop advantage on mograine
---
I think most, like me have just rerolled pve. A good bit have quit tho, yes.
---
I disagree with transfers but with faction login queue add faction change as well so servers balance out without having a horde exodus to other servers.
---
not following your logic here. what exactly is it that you criticise?
---
Yeah raid two is getting fucked intentionally. You guys should leave and form a new guild or stop raiding with them.
---
I seem to be pretty lucky with these drops, highest points for me was 4 zhevra hooves off 5 kills, 1st kill drop Cats emerald, and this thing dropping like 2 minutes after coming in. And that's all just since classic came out. Ofc nobody believes any of it.
---
I don't live in the US, piss off with your Thanksgiving excuse shit.
---
Whats the best Hunter auto shot timer? I use YAHT but I feel like it's been out of sync lately.
---
Not to mention shaman. Using fear as alliance is a waste of a 2 second cast
---
Just using the computer puts me to sleep nowadays. We just getting old.
---
Yeah i was feeling pressured a bit to get a good PvP rank but luckily blizzard totally fucked up the honor system so I don't have to bother with logging in anymore.
---
Wisdom ticks of Mana show in the combat log.
---
how? even corpse running from TP to BRD waiting 2 minutes each rez, without moving at all while alive you'd get there in less than an hour
---
Man this makes me so glad my guild rolls around in 5-10 man pvp groups together on benediction. Today for the first time in many weeks we took over BRM and I posted a particular camper with a legendary weapons death 6x on our server forums.
---
Dude I am quite uncool by some standards. Some would even consider me a "punk bitch".
---
Lol, I have alliance and horde. Both on pvp servers. I will tell you it’s no fun being horde and always 5v1 alliance. There is no skill, it’s not fun and after awhile it’s kind of just gotten dry. 
---
Farming in large groups only yield minimal honor so that’s also a bust. 
---
My point in this is that being toxic and attempting to force players to quit is down right stupid. It goes beyond horde vs alliance. The fact is you need these players inorder for the game to survive. You’re the retail horde, honorless.
---
Don’t worry about the hit neck if you have dark advisors neck. Use felheart robe, sash of whispered secrets, and the scholo neck
---
Dick move for sure but that’s 200iq forreal
---
Okay then just take a break because the wow devs are taking a break. Again, it’s okay if you don’t rank up one week.
---
what did streamers do to you?
---
Was that the reason? He wasn't stream sniping he was doing world pvp
---
I'm on Fairbanks and everyone leveling in my guild except 1 or 2 have either quit or rerolled to a PvE server. 
---
Most of the 60s now only log on to raid except for the 5 or 6 that enjoy PvP.
---
Hopefully Bgs fix this because it isn't that fun.
---
I thought that was a very helpful piece of advice. My response would have been: “oh shit, didn’t realize, thanks!”
---
soon people will design way to tell which server will be horde server and which server will be alliance server XD
---
You realise that all these people played throughout phase 1 where there was "lots of PvP on a PvP server" yet they didn't complain.
---
It astounds me how obtuse people can be and not understand this point.
---
to be fair, it really isn't okay if you're attempting to get rank 1. Every week matters and requires insane amounts of playtime.   
---
I'd imagine seeing that time go to waste and have people just tell you to calm down can be incredibly frustrating.
---
Got two raid geared 60s and a 50, rerolled on pve and now 25, couldn't be happier with the change.
---
I quit on Skeram. Game isn't currently fun.
---
Trug Trug
---
feeling wonderful. thank you.
---
Nope they won't. They are too busy camping flight paths for honor. Cant wait for BGs to slap them across the face with the harsh reality that they are not only bad at the game, but have to wait in 1 hour queues
---
I actually found an official response they posted yesterday
---

Good. I'm glad Reddit gives you the validation that you need so badly. (:

I think there's an exception when someone is attempting to show off a bug or glitch that can only be proven with in game visuals. It's not like he's out here shamelessly plugging his twitch channel every couple days.

50/50 whether these work or just make you say that you're an idiot or something.
---
I could be wrong but it limits how much total honor you can achieve that week. I believe it’s like 50 dishonorable kills and you lose a weeks worth of progress
---
I put the blame solely on Blizzard. Players will always do the optimal actions, even if its lengthy, boring, dickish, whatever. Blizzard designed a PvP system where you farm players like you farm mobs. 
---
Add increased pop limits, and its a receipe for disaster.
---
Can’t gain honour if there is no one to kill.
---
Haha great
---
Try em out on the website. You can decode each letter to confirm. Popular sayings like go to retail can be replicated. I think it's legit.
---
No they absolutely did not. And they were complained about then. And blizzard did nothing. Blizzard did nothing about many things in vanilla. 
---
Once again in pre release this reddit tried to warn players and they were constantly downvoted by retail players who watched YouTube videos, played a little private servers, and just demanded they knew better. And now here we are:
---
Woo boy some of these comments are sad. The fuck is wrong with these people. One said “you play late at night you must be ganking. I’m happy you didn’t get honor”. What kind of brain dead person would say that seriously. 
---
Considering blizzard hasn’t even acknowledged this bug is reason enough to be upset. Hopefully they get on that ASAP.
---
I feel that if you have to be in a 100 yard range from the BG NPC to stay in Que for BGs added with the longer que times for hored, that most of this will go away.
---
Thanks friend :)
---
The game in its release state was much harder as we are playing on the 1.12 client. They revamped literally every class slowly over 2 years making them more powerful one by one and only at the end when Naxx was released did vanilla wow get all the upgrades we now have access to from the get go.
---
If you want proof go read every set of patch notes from 1.0 to 1.12.
---
Ah gotaxha, thought k was about to learn some pro strats

Why would a general manager be working a hourly position and not salary... 
---
Your the boss. Lmayo. 
---
Btw you should probably delete some of these before you pretend to be something you arent to impress the donald.
---
Lmfao.
---
No, the addon had to guess what their casttime was. You could see the start of the cast in the log but there’d be no information about the progress, pushback etc.
---
Furor is amazing for shift out/shift in -&gt; enrage and/or feral charge pretty much whenever you're low on rage. OOC is a proc so can't be ever relied on like Furor.
---
OOC is great, but Furor is able to be flipped like a switch, on demand.
---
"We thought blizzard were competent enough to give us Classic, they weren't".
---
server time.
---
If all the alliance have quit/re-leveling on pve then the queues are going to be astronomical for Horde without a premade.
---
Lol anyon can run a marathon you just have to do it it's easy.
---
I also got it on my first yeti yesterday on my shaman, didn’t do the quest on main and just assumed it was a 100% drop when i got it
---
This isn't an 'if' question; it's a 'when'. The game was permanently scuffed when they went with layered megaservers and with the removal of said layers the toll is due. Nothing is going to stop the gradual eflux of players from PvP servers, primarily from the minority factions on larger servers. Things will settle down once only 5kish active players remain on any servers but, at that point it'll be 90/10 ratios. 
---
Personally, I don't think I can reroll. I've put a ton of time into five characters. I'm 50/50 on whether I'd continue playing with the world mostly closed off. Not only is that economically limiting but it just rubs me the wrong way to reward a company with $180/year for botching it this badly and not fixing it. On the other hand, I'm in a great guild and my primary goal coming back was a Kel'Thuzad kill. If they're all going to stick with it and just raid log for a year I might do that too.
---
Live your life long enough until the next max level comes at you
---
You’re missing the point. It’s not about an app providing information that is provided by the company. It is about the information being provided in the first place. Spy shouldn’t have access to enemy player information because *that information shouldn’t be available to access.*
---
No one states nor implies Spy cheated. We know it accesses information made available by Blizzard. We say that info shouldn’t be available as it breaks the game. This isn’t Halo where your warrior has motion detection, thermal vision, etc. You shouldn’t know about a player’s presence unless you’ve seen them or they’ve targeted you already.
---
Then just look for a generic tanking guide and take into account your level.
---
This is very extreme. Telling somebody they need SGC to get invited to raid is pretty different than asking for people to have put some effort into getting gear. If you’re LC there’s no way you can give gear to somebody who barely tries, and somebody who is actively wanting to make their contributions greater. 
---
For the record, we’re semi-hardcore, but I’ve got friends in hardcore guilds and even they wouldn’t require their raiders to get SGC but you can get Cadaverous armor or like 4 other blues that are fine and much better than a random green.
---
And that invalidates the entire warlock class.
---
That means, the alliance only has 2 cloth wearing classes at full strength.
---
That means, the alliance runs more melee classes.
---
Those melee classes get fed the meat grinder, which is Horde fears.
---
It's a vicious cycle.
---
Im horde on horde server. We have +50 ppl online on raid days and 5-15 at most on others.
---
Its not just because of pvp imbalance as you see my sitiatuon is the opposite. Theres just not that much to do anymore. Theoretically sure I could level all classes to 60, level all professions to max and farm unlimited amount of gold. But thats just not the reality for majority of players.
---
Casuals have stopped playing and HC/active players have reduced play hours to raid days mainly.
---
Wooahhh... I've done all of those!
---
I wasn't attacking you, so sorry if it seemed that way.  
---
Look, there's things I like about classic, and things I like about retail.  I like retails dungeons, raids and the mechanical difficulty of classes.
---
That's my opinion. 
---
You don't have to like those things. You have a different opinion, and that's fine.  Neither is right or wrong. They are preferences.
---
Don't bring another class that has it as pre bis.  Don't be disappointed in the hunter, be disappointed in your dice.  Hunter has every right to roll also just don't bring them or shaman if horde.
---
5 minutes of effort to make someone almost drop a weeks worth of ranking isnt a waste of time by any stretch
---
That is not nerfing an accurate statement would be "classic is easier than vanilla because spells and talent trees start at thier 1.12 versions which are objectively better than thier predecessors"
---
Same
---
The problem is that alliance are too dumb to grind dungeons.  Had this happened to horde we would have been fine.
---
Yep!
---
Yeah I always kept an eye on combat log back in the days.
---
It's really not hard.
---
So instead of attempting to fix an issue that Blizzard knew was going to happen you'd rather throw shade at the players.  That's a bold strategy, Cotton, let's see If it pays off for them!
---
If i gather 5 guys that mage will die, can't say the same about rogue
---
Pug bgs will always get stomped in this fashion by pre mades.
---
Get a group together and que with a basic stratergy and you’ll do alot better.
---
Nobody is dropping a weeks worth of ranking because of one guy...come on
---
That must be why nobody ever rolled warrior in arena
---
Oh wait
---
Disingenuous or naive, but not wrong.
---
Server type is a big decision- a lot of classic players did not give it the consideration that it requires and therefore wound up making a big mistake.
---
When you sign up to play on a pvp server, you are acknowledging that you can be killed at any time, in any contested zone.
---
"Oh it probably won't be so bad"  ...yeah...read that again.
---
I let my sub run out before p2.  Being on one of the first servers from name reservation sounded good.  Until I realized 99% of people who cared enough to reserve a name also cared enough to no life that shit to 60 and gank under geared/leveled players.  They whined for DM so bad blizzard dropped it early.  I knew then I needed to cancel my sub because it was set to renew 2 days before p2.  So glad I did when I was mid 50s trying to do some quests and just being constantly ganked.  I ran a /who and there were 2 alliance in my zone.  I started writing names of people ganking.  I had over 75 names of different horde ganking that area and over that time only saw 12 alliance names in /who.  Pretty sad state for the game.  Alliance slowly started relying on dungeon spam and as they went that way world PvP got worse and more went to dungeon spam...  I went healer to fill for groups but I still like to play the game.  I had professions and quests I like to do.  Felt impossible to quest as a healer when you'd get ganked by some horde fully specd for PvP @60.  
---
This is exactly what "you think you do but but you don't" meant.  
---
It's impossible to play Vanilla again in that same state.  Especially when it's being ran by current blizzard.
---
The game was unbalanced but at the time, no one really knew it so it was all fair play.  I got ganked in Vanilla but the horde alliance ratio (at least on magtheridon) was like 57/43 and everyone was exploring the world.  So many people just cornered the market on professions and grind the perfect spot for mats that it's not worth it to do it yourself.  When I got ganked, a quick /3 for help and people were eager to fight.  
---
I was in some nasty SS v TM battles that were ok but after 30 minutes it was 50+ horde and like 20 alliance.  You couldn't even do the quest in the cave because horde groups had tags on lock.  You couldn't quest in tanaris because mages were farming and if you managed to kill one mid pull, you look like the asshole and they cry for help and then it's a quick 10v2 and you're stuck with the 10 minute death walk and then get camped.  By the time I got to 45 I just couldn't grind the game anymore.  
---
People had /played of like 10 days after the first month.  And they were almost all horde.
---
Raid log until phase 3.
---
45/55 is still awful. Things snowball, so it becomes very difficult to accomplish anything
---
As usual the biggest complainers are heard the loudest.
---
The sad reality is that we all knew what servers would end up overpopulated and people still rolled on them.
---
Zero sympathy. Zero fucks given about these idiots who followed dipshit streamers to their servers.
---
Gotta be blizz HQ?
---
I have a Horde character on Herod because my friends refuse to leave and the faction imbalance isn't so fun. The only Alliance that seem to want to pvp are rogues and level 60 players that gank lowbies.
---
Does this community even have mods?
---
&gt; Rule 7: Non-Classic / low effort memes are defined as memes that would not clearly be related to World of Warcraft: Classic if text overlay or overlaid game logos/game elements were removed from the image. For example, most advice animal memes and label memes are considered to be low effort memes. Essentially, the base image should be from Classic.
---
This is such garbage content.
---
I have not tested or found that Phantom Blade stacks with sunder armor but it is safe to say that it does. Similar weapons like Annihilator (chance to reduce armor) does stack with sunder. I would recommend Annihilator over Phantom blade. I do not know the name of the debuf(s) though.  
---
  
---
Armor reduction is a swept aside topic but it is a good topic to know about and learn. Boss armor reduction of incoming damage works on a curve. DPS increase due to armor penetration work similar. More is better till you cap out (meaning there is a limit to a bosses armor value that you can reduce). Problems occur when people assume some min/max theories and try to manage the limited debuf slots a boss can have (16). The extra slot of phantom blade or Annihilator may be questioned in a raid. 
---
The most common armor debufs and used due to pure value. 
---
Sunder Armor and Expose Armor do not stack. (2250 / 1750)  
---
Faerie Fire (505)
---
COR (640)
---
PVP is only fun for them when it's a 40v1.
---
Ya they will unsub for like 10 days and then resub once bgs come out. 
---
That does literally nothing to affect their or ur own wallet.
---
[deleted]
---
Unrelated maybe related note: is this honor roll over why around 430ish I suddenly got thrown off a flight path mid zone, dropped to the ground, and then the server crashed shortly after? (With some “instance aborted” message)
---
&gt;Time gating, time gating and more time gating
---
sounds exactly like classic
---
lmfao so misleading. Cool come play Alliance on Herod, and have fun. These statistics are incorrect and statistics never lie.
---
Honestly, if Blizzard wants to save their subscription count, they should allow people to transfer off of PvP servers.
---
I only got a glimpse before it was deleted, but sounds like a PVE server to me.
---
So low level players need to ask for a full guild intervention whenever they want to complete a quest, or farm? Do you understand how stupid that sounds?
---
Another guild doing better than you with DBM doesn't affect your guild. Someone using Spy to kill you does.
---
Stop
---
It's better than T1 for Hunter too. T1 is just used for the 8 set, so until then a Hunter should still be using SGC.
---
Though personally, in a guild run I'd pass it to a Warrior because T1/Ogre Forged are at least close-ish for Hunter, whereas for Warrior SGC is the clear winner for a loooong time. PUGing? Any Hunter who'd pass this over to a Warrior has made a foolish decision.
---
Rolling on both is kind of a dick move, just sayin'
---
Most likely, yes.
---
The vast majority of my friends (who are to be fair, casual) haven't played or have severely reduced their play since P2 dropped. As for me, I had 2 60s in MC gear when P2 dropped and even I have severely reduced my playing time since P2. Basically only raiding now. And I'm on one of few even faction balance PVP servers (Incendius). Ideal world PVP to me is organized raids on quest hubs/towns or world-encounter 1v1s (or 1v2/2v2s) that happen organically while you're both out questing/farming. 
---
What were seeing now is a pathetic race for honor at the cost of literally fucking up the entire game world and experience for players. Its not my cup of tea.
---
Looking forward to BGs both to play in them so I can farm honor the 'real' way and so I can actually like go out in the world and do stuff normally.
---
Were you counting the right mobs? I think only a certain mob drops it in that cave.
---
HonorSpy is causing the chat lag, it's flooding the system with millions of messages hence introducing massive amounts of delay. 
---
Blizzard needs to resolve this, for example by introducing a flooding control into the chat API.

When BGs come out things will get better.

Or maybe you should actually know what your talking about before you start talking, rather than try and sound like you were correct all along when nothing could be further from the truth?

Sadly this is far too common these days.. People on the internet  hate being wrong and would rather be rude than accept their mistakes.

yep, it's delightfully awful

Do you have like any proof? I see literally a copy pasta of this spread everywhere can you back any of it up?

No rush in classic wow

You’re obviously a very intelligent person, and quite good at name-calling. Also seem to have top notch social skills. 
---
I’m sure you realize comparing a system in wow to another another games system actually relates to wow. 
---
That is how a discussion starts. I’m sure you’ve had a discussion or two before comparing two things.
---
BGs aren't going to help a whole lot, since horde players will probably have incredibly long queue times. They'll just run around like they do now while they're waiting for the queue to pop. If anything, it'll probably make the problem worse since there will be a higher horde to alliance ratio in the open world, since alliance players will have better queue times.

I've no shame to say that I do report people doing that all the time, whether they are on my own faction or not and I do hope they get banned.
---
Spamming insults or provocative messages to the person that's just been killed (most likely ganked) is not funny, respectful or sportsmanlike by any stretch of imagination, good fight or not.
---
You should have used your time in a better way, dude.
---
100% Agree, also maybe because Alliance can't complete a single quest without being ganked 10 times by groups of Horde.
---
It 100% does.
---
The less people on your side, the easier it is to get ranks and therefore PvP gear. 
---
Grinding at graveyards is a terrible way to earn honor, the most efficient way is to simply finish the BG as fast as possible.
---
The census addon takes 1.5 hrs to run now. I honestly wouldn't trust that it accurately represents any population other than the players who were online during the window you ran it. The census upload data is often partial and very very spread out. It is not reliable.

Not even close to true my guy

They also nerfed a bunch of things in MC. So even if you're being pedantic, we're getting a nerfed version of wow. Again read patch notes.

Putting premades against other premades and randoms against other randoms has been a very standard part of BG matchmaking for a long time now, why do people think this won’t be a feature..?

So you can fuck another server into the other direction.
---
Why are horde pallies stronger?  Is it due to the BE silence?
---
Sorry, but you're Horde so your opinion doesn't count at all. Try rerolling ally on a PVP server 48-59 and you will be jumped by 5-10 man deathballs all the time or always die as you land at any contested FP. That's nowhere near the same thing as what you're experiencing as a Horde lvl 50-58.
---
"Ideally starting with the alliance dominant servers"
---
There is one ganking server with an Alliance majority.
---
Wouldn’t you like to know :P
---
As i said, stop theorycrafting if you dont know what you are talking about. Find a decent warrior in might/wrath gear who can play, duel him  and all your suggestions and theories will drop quickly. A little armor and stam is a lot of stam and there is also defense rating buddy.
---
He's not comparing it to another system. He's saying classic rage system sucks and \[insert game\] rage system is good. No explanation why, no argument, just saying "hey guys classic bad my game good bye bye".

Think you need to read the thread a couple more times, you seem to be struggling with basic reading comprehension.
---
Take that mage, and move it into ZF for that solo dungeon 120k xp / hour grind untill you are lvl 54 - no problem at all.
---
I've been using spy for awhile and I didnt realize you could click and target them.. definately helps cause a third of the time when people show up they're on flight paths
---
I hate that players back blizzard up by spouting this endlessly.
---
Clearly there are *many* aspects of classic that people love over retail, the idea that the game has to be perfect or never released is just... stupid.
---
I just rolled alts for peak time. Hasn’t been too bad so far. Now, business trip until Dec 7th.

Honestly what kind of fucking loser digs through 3 months of someone's post history to try and find some shit to talk? Go do something productive you fucking cretin

Have an Alliance alt on Grobbulus. Have been running SM. The entrance is constantly camped by 60 Horde who one shot you then /laugh. A 60 UD Rogue was camping for over three hours.
---
Troll racial are all garbage compared to the other horde racials. Shaman Tauren or orc, War Stomp into full combo as elem, War stomps into heals, orcs have bloodlust for the extra damage and if you get a WF proc off that you’re gonna demolish plus stun resist. Priest UD WoTF is uncomparably better. Same with mage. Look at warrior, warstomps help aoe dungeon tanking and help PvP interrupt heals/casts, again stun resist is insane for PvP and so is the extra melee damage, the only class you can maybe argue trolls got it good is hunter with zerk + rapid fire stacking but that’s about it. Orc stun resist is still better but you lose the bloodlust since it’s melee specific. 
---
Or you know you can “gib mi 10%” if you want

It’s okay, we don’t expect you to understand. Don’t hurt your brain too much.

What, it's like 14 agi and a couple str over the one in scholo?  lol

They wouldn’t appear on spy if they were really just sitting there. Fun fact:  the nazgul could also just /target Frodo
---
Absolutely. If you have enough active and contributing members, that seems a perfectly fair way to distribute. My guild is LC, but we still roll off a ton of items for fairness. Same regard for big items like you mentioned though. 
---
I actually think class leads are really good to have. Most guilds don't have enough officers to go around, so having someone that knows their class really well can help out the whole raid. I don't wanna write you a novel here, but I'm warlock lead in my guild and after i helped some of the others stack crit gear better and spec properly, we seen huge improvements among all the locks.
---
Also, no staff of dom yet? Yikes thats unlucky
---
Would you like a tissue?
---
Just a few more and you can spam ST lol
---
Hasn't your server already hit the ceiling on twink item prices? I got all my sets for a combined about 300g close to launch and the other day I mathed out that if they sell for AH price id have 3.4k profit. 
---
On Mograine EU they went up drastically after P2 then went up again by a lot when BGs got a date.
---
^This
---
Most guilds have their tanks in place. For dungeons though, the world is your oyster as a tank.
---
Guilds are ALWAYS looking for healers though. Priest healers are actually pretty common though so if the most important thing to you is to find a raid spot, rDruid, rSham or hPali are your best bet.
---
Almost all guilds are looking for non-priest healers and Locks.
---
releasing honor without bgs was the only thing they did right, and it's only lasting a month.  once bg's are live the game's just a retail clone
---
They win trade honor, sell bosses, and log in together. I’ve screen shotted  and reported it all. However these players pay 30$ a month so my opinion doesn’t mean jack shit as they’ll fill the void I leave behind with their 2-3+ accounts. 
---
Stalaag is dead. Bury it. There is no positive to being  on this server ESPECIALLY for pvp.
---
&gt;I think the private servers bred some of this culture, which for those coming back to wow after 15 years break for a nostalgia trip is something quite alien.
---
Nope, wasn't like that on pservers, at least not nost, ely or LH when I played there. They were also way more balanced.
---
His set key is 1
---
I believe they want it to fail and they are going to end up trying to funnel classic players back into retail eventually through some scheme.
---
If they wanted it to succeed there would at least be a dedicated portion on their website for classic. In vanilla they had the armory to look stuff up they had standings and such for pvp. None of that is on classic. I agree they want it to fail
---
I haven't looked at the numbers in awhile for balance but its felt balanced because before P2 I was seeing a TON of ally ganking especially in and around BRM. I was seeing ally gank squads in Searing Gorge before P2 even dropped. Maybe its got worse since P2? I always thought we were 55/45. I haven't gone out ganking myself so I guess I can't speak for the numbers currently.
---
Doesn't matter. Your Holy Paladins are doing no damage while they Cleanse. Some damage &gt; no damage.
---
It's not a must-have by any means but one Ret per raid is nice to have.
---
I use weakauras.
---
Naw they worked fine, you just had a trash connection to the server
---
No, it's not.
---
With positive ratio, the majority faction is still going to have more gank squads at flight points and generally disrupting questing and dungeoneering. This causes the minority faction to have less of a good time, causing some of them to log off, reroll, quit or play a character on another server.
---
This causes the ratio to be more positive, causing an even less good time for the minority faction, making the ratio even more positive.
---
Whether it's 1500:500 or 15000:5000, the minority is going to spend a lot of their time not enjoying the game ...
---
These days if you don’t get an achievement and a shiny title for doing it, nobody cares. Sad if you ask me, creating and completing challenges for fun has always been a core part of gaming for me.
---
The difficulty you can impose on yourself in classic (and honestly, any game) is limitless, but people for some reason insist on only running instances with too geared 60’s, want to join an MC raid that’s clearing in 45 minutes instead of one just forming, and basically play the game in the easiest possible manner.... then scoff about how easy the game is because the difficulty isn’t being forced on to them.
---
To each their own, but sounds boring to me.
---
I am trying to retrain Restorative Potion from Ghak Healtouch with no luck.
---
I had alchemy, did the quest and got the training from him, then later on in leveling dumped alch for something else.
---
Now I have picked it up again, but am unable to train it from him or redo the quest, how can I get it back?
---
I just got the ring of the underwood at lvl 32, on my rogue. It’s a badass ring, but still decided to sell it for 25g; because GOLD
---
You have to also actually press the buttons.
---
Orc doesnt need to press shit. They just resist automatically. Removing another method of skill
---
Every alliance on Herod, Stalagg, etc SHOULD quit and or reroll on a pve server.  Leave en masse and ruin the game for the horde on those servers.  Let them circle jerk alone by themselves about how good they are in pvp.

When you run brd you will find a 2% crit chest and your legs will be devilsaur eventually
---
True. In vanilla /classic it is just guessing. Which makes it even less advantageous.
---
You can't follow my logic of if you don't want to PvP then don't play on a PvP server?
---
There’s no point anymore man. I understand your concept you are trying to get across but alliance on Stalaag is legit pointless. You will NEVER be in the top pvp ranks. You won’t find groups and you will NEVER get a world boss as &lt;GRIZZLY&gt; sells and controls the server  by the balls. 
---
Just waiting for BGs right now and if those are ass then I’m done with WoW altogether. It was a fun nostalgic trip but this toxicity is worth 15$ a month lmfao
---
The saddest part of the faction imbalance is even 5:1 it’s still reasonable to kill off one of the zergers  before you drop. Battleground farming will be a breeze once they realize you can’t make 50:10 WSG groups.  
---
I’m personally looking forward to crushing even more horde on the 10th.
---
just goes to show you alliance are COWARDS
---
Lol world boss just get it
---
Hord smart
---
You can deal with it, stop playing the game or reroll on a PvE server.
---
Your right guys, classics perfect
---
Clique literally never breaks from updates, so that argument is done.
---
Mouse over macros are two different hand doing actions, which definitely makes it slower than just over in the mount and hitting right click. And modifier keys are generally easier to rest your hand on in a defular position.
---
Is there a reason why you guys can't just roll on a PvE server? That's exactly what several of my real-life friends did, and this is before the honor system...
---
The dire warnings that the YouTubers predicted have come to pass. Everyone thought that PvP was just about to be all about fair fights, gentlemanly salutes followed by fights, and maybe some gankers but those would be the minority.

But they turned out to be right. Maybe we didn't expect roving groups of 60's farming entire zones for 12-16 hours a day...that was something I didn't think would happen, but it has.
---
But the point is, when they said "most people shouldn't roll on a PvP server" no one listened and they got dismissed as being just alarmists. The reality is this:
---
PvP servers cater to a certain kind of crowd. The ganker type that loves unfair advantages and indeed thrives on them.
---
If you had known that the server would become where the gankers took 2-3 weeks off work at release to race to 60, get all their gear asap, and proceed to steamroll all below them *in co-ordinated groups on every strategic location possible*, would you have rolled on a PvP server? I think not.
---
They fixed this unless something has changed since the range nerf to the combat log last week.
---
&gt; Blizzard merges them with a server that's alliance heavy to balance things.
---
What alliance heavy servers?  People seem to think there really are any.. there's only 1 alliance dominated server, Heartseeker, and it's much smaller pop than any of the big horde servers.
---
There's literally no solution that doesn't involve forced faction changes.
---
Yeah obviously thanks genius
---
If this is the problem, why isn't there chat lag like this on the US servers?
---
&gt; and the other day I mathed out that if they sell for AH price id have 3.4k profit.
---
Yeah and then you realized everybody and their mother did exactly the same as you and so the prices will plummet come launch day as everyone tries to offload their stores.
---
My alt is 52.  This is the blackrock exp for me at 3 server

Horde Whitemane here. Alliance had a hard time at first, but in the last week they are in organized premades keeping the paths to DM, Strat, and BRM safe. The PvP has actually been excellent now that the Alliance are more organized. Be like the Alliance on Whitemane.
---
Roll alliance, and let us know how they are cowards.
---
macro MS or to do a /startattack. or whatever its your game
---
I get your frustration but as far as the game’s mechanics go, you are soylent green. To think otherwise is rather foolish, you’re literally just honor points to an honor starved Horde.
---
I've heard similar before while I was in a casual-moderate raiding guild on Nost. 
---
I felt like telling them to fuck off unless they're going to pay me like it's a job.
---
What the literal fuck do MC parses (lmao) have to do with open world uncontrolled pvp population imbalance lmao
---
Fucking APES would get bulldozed if they played on Stalagg
---
Pagle, whitemane?
---
Yep clique is the best thing ever.
---
It let's you cast faster and also frees up keyboards on your bar.
---
It's cross realm so that won't be much of an issue. Also did bgs prior to cross realm and 30 to 1 hour queues. Bgs were about 5 times as efficient.
---
EU server are bigger.
---
Not anymore. This was fixed last week.
---
I know this has been asked a million times but I’m looking at mage or warlock for an alt when I already play hunter. I don’t really feel the urge to raid on either,  but the difference seems to be better aoe on mage with better solo capability on warlock. Is playing alliance going to be worse on one than the other? Should I go with mage since it’s not as similar to hunter?
---
I dropped LW as soon as I noticed the 2 pieces went for about 175g on my server, which I could easily afford even after getting my 60% mount. 
---
Your server may differ but in my experience lw is just useless.
---
you've got it all backwards.  alliance will be the dominant pvp faction once bgs are live.  alliance will always have bgs up to play in, they'll become experts.  horde will continue to be the uncoordinated zerg that gets to practice queues more than bgs
---
No. really. There are feedback loops that mean it's never going to get better.
---
It was a fucked model.
---
The most simplified/optimized version is this:
---
    #showtooltip
---
    /cast [@mouseover,help][] Heal
---
This will cast at your mouseover if you have one that’s friendly. If you don’t, it will follow normal casting rules (target if friendly, self if not).
---
Scarlet armory is a great dungeon for warrior.
---
Great warr legs. A 1% crit mail helm with good stats. And ravager which is one of the iconic wow weapons.
---
4* kills, it goes 100 - 75 -50 - 25 % honor.  So the 4th kill still awards some.
---
Av event?
---
I’m Horde on Thunderfury. It’s been annoying for me since P2 came out. Guess it’s even worse for you guys? Hard to tell from my perspective how Horde heavy our server is.
---
People are indeed unsubbing, but I find it hard to believe that Blizzard wants it’s biggest monthly money maker to fail. Especially considering they gave us DM and BG’s early, as well as other community requests like faction limited free transfers.
---
You should just reroll on a PvE server. It's not like you can't get your progress back. And not to mention, rolling on a new server brings a new community and ample opportunities to make new friends.
---
Friend of mine re-rolled to RP-PvE and the community was completely different. By that I don't mean just a little different, I mean drastically so.
---
PvP feels like a place full of angsty teens who are always itching for a fight. RP-PvE feels like this is where all the adults are, who are actually helpful and respond to even simple game mechanics questions in general chat.
---
Or faction specific transfers. And it goes off in batches to ensure 500 leave, and 500 join for example.
---
Free Hong Kong
---
what a quitter, I was 48! When the honor system dropped, and I still made it to 60, i'm horde btw ;) \*on faerlina\*
---
Exactly so hunters don’t need SGC
---
You ma'am!  Have a happy cake day!!!
---
Yes, he did make a mistake.
---
You can get someone else to make your dragonscale into armor, and you can get someone else to make your devilsaur skins into devilsaur.
---
Dying 15 times to get to a dungeon is fun.
---
Weakauras. Can't stress enough how simple yet flexible this addon is.
---
Yep! Wore those shoulders until last week when I got my NS shoulders. I had people ask why I was still using them and said straight up... I am not farming UBRS for hours and hours for a 24AP difference when I’m already one of the top DPS. I’ve seen them drop twice and passed to lesser geared guild members both times.
---
Same deal with bracers.. Deep Fury bracers have a grand total of 4AP over shadowcraft, but cost 5 times as much. I’m not spending 150g on 4AP.
---
And so on. Way too many people just have a BiS list and think that anything less is worthless. I’ve also noticed that many of the people I know who obsessively farmed for that stuff have burnt out and quit already.
---
Overall, I think gnomes have a slight edge because ur wordt matchup, Rogue, gets a bit easier with escape artist.
---
Imagine rolling on a pvp server and then QQing about getting ganked while solo farming.
---
Classic is "time gated" to replicate the original release schedule. If everything was released all at once, people would burn through it in a month and then quit.
---
But.....but..... they rolled a pvp server........... they should know how to 1v10 right?
---
Well, you didn't state that it does, but if you glance around the comments here you'll see plenty of people saying it's cheating or tantamount to cheating. I understand that you think it shouldn't be available. I admit that when playing my druid it has made it more difficult than when I played vanilla, but I wasn't super bothered.
---
World PvP was already completely "dead" in TBC. If you liked it 2008-2010, odds are that even retail vanilla would've been too much..
---
I wouldnt try it past ZF honestly.
---
Fool
---
&gt; bringing DPS/tanking consumables
---
Some people in my guild bring consumables but I never do and I am consistently doing well enough on the DPS meters. Our guild is pretty much: if we can clear it, we're good (unless your DPS is just embarrassing.)
---
With that said, I'll definitely be bringing consumables for like Vael when BWL comes out for the first few clears at least, but I'd hate to be mandated to do something that we don't NEED to do. The amount of time it would take me to farm gold/firewater/etc every week is way more than the time we would save in MC if I did.
---
Oh yeah, naturally.  It's well known in war that having a bigger army is a major asset in winning.  It's just called 'common sense'.
---
You haven't really won anything that matters, though.  Winning through numbers in a children's pixie elf simulator is pretty yikes.. not the kind of story I'd share to talk about how cool I am.
---
Well, I mean, you could not be a toxic piece of shit, and just wait for bgs.  Dont pretend people are twisting your arm to make you do this...  You can use just an iota of self control, and not participate in the worst aspects of phase2.
---
The main issue I have is that I, a level 52, gives honor to 60s when they kill me. I have a very small chance of surviving- but since I give honor every 60 I see kills me. I’d be happy if they just restricted the level range that gives honor. Instead of TEN levels below make it 3-5. We lower levels could at least have a fighting chance. As it is now we are just easy kills so leveling from 50-60 is at a standstill. 
---
That said, I love wpvp and I am glad more people are doing it.
---
Some people in my guild think our MT shouldn't get threat pces and should aim for 8/8 t1, I know this is wrong but I can't find enough resources on it if you have anywhere you could point me to. Thanks :)
---
The threat generation of TC is pretty damn good for having to be used in battle stance. 
---
So much of tanking in classic feels clunky.
---
Deathdealer's Breastplate is only a 5str/14agi difference, man. Works just fine for me and a bunch of other lazy slobs lol.

---
Do you kill Observer Chorush in tribute runs?
---
The servers where alliance dominate are ALL pve, minus one (Heartseeker) which has a tiny population.
---
And it's like that on retail too, with some realms having as high as 6:1 **Blood Elf** to Alliance ratios.
---
Jesus you type and sound like an edgy teen. 
---
Roll alliance on Stalaag. Level your character to  30. Then speak for yourself you lil cry baby bitch acting like people give a shit. 
---
You made this post to have others comment and agree with you and it backfired completely. 
---
Do you honestly think a level 60 is going to go solo to thermore to help someone level 20-30 just to get camped by 10+ people? 
---
The only time you don’t get camped on the boat is when you’re doing ONY with a full raid . 
---
 Nice try doofus
---
Bubblehearth for the poor.
---
I cleared outside and inside the cave 8 times on my warrior at 03... Got 14 greens while farming it...
---
Got forors on my first solo dm lasher run on my main, so guess that makes up for it.
---
Battlegrounds will fix it. People only go to these extreme lengths at the moment because there is a reward involved. They won't be able to get those rewards in the open world once battlegrounds are a thing.
---
I mean its been the same price for 15 years, so I dont see why it would go down?
---
the thing that killed this game was its players
---
&gt; Looks like no Horde on Whitemane upload frequently.
---
Given how a large part of the Horde Whitemane community are Taiwanese (i.e. the SMOrc guild), are they not aware of what WCP is, and thus they don't upload as often?
---
I'm talking about allowing it from horde to alliance not the other way.  It will help even if its not gonna make it completely even.
---
Haha I am waiting for BGs bud. WPVP is garbage, but I'm just saying that for the people who ARE going for rank 14, they have no choice at the moment. It's the game and it's reward system working on an extreme level and it's not the individuals fault.
---
Lol, about time....
---
Yeah because suicide bombing afk players is literally the only way to get any kills
---
&gt; will check and ruin few bgs once they drop on 49s and wait for some competition in 15yo game while giving money to someone who dont even care not have 80 iq for basic solutions
---
Imagine insulting someone’s intelligence while writing a comment like this lol
---
Is it that bad in Europe too?
---
Sorry to hear that, hope they shit on yall
---
..
---
I have cadaverous and the mail chest from the seven...
---
No doubt, I’m not part of a guild that wastes people’s time, but I’m more than free to point out guilds that so waste people’s time. 
---
I don’t raid cutting edge progression these days and am definitely not hardcore, at least not anymore. Don’t have the time. I’m in a likeminded guild that cleared MC in our first raid night though, because it’s easy. Stopped using consumables after the third run through, and easily clear in well under 2 hours. 
---
And LOL. Hardcore guilds in classic. These raids are all raid finder difficulty. It’s a bunch of people who fancy themselves hardcore, when they’re just not. Watch a method stream of retail WoW if you want to see a real hardcore raid.
---
It does if your trying for server/world firsts. And again it doesn't really matter since it's available to both sides, if you don't wanna use it don't use it, it doesn't mean that someone who does use it is somehow cheating.
---
fAcTiOn BaSeD qUeueS
---
If I hear this one more time I’m just gonna lose it, this is one big echo chamber suggestion that doesn’t make sense, no, the answer to solving issues with disruptive gameplay is not imposing a queue to punish the other faction for simply existing on the server, the real answer is to just make every server PvE. Interested in pvp? Cool. /pvp...not interested in pvp? Don’t flag. 
---
Opposing faction not flagging? Cool...go to battlegrounds. 
---
Wow, it’s a win win for everyone!
---
I play on a PvP server with a balanced faction ratio.
---
And Warriors don’t need HoJ
---
Hit makes everything better yes, but the comment above rings the truth. Warlocks won’t search for much hit gear until bloodvine is available. Once we can get closer to double digit hit rating is when it gets better. It’s better to rock sp over 10 per percent of hit or a percent of crit over hit right now.
---
it's actually very simple. change the way the combat works when it comes to enemy players. make it work the same as always for everything besides enemy players. for enemy players make it so they don't show in your combat log unless they take a direct action against you like attacking or casting a spell at you.
---
A friend of mine (that doesn't play classic anymore, wasn't for him) made me a red shirt that I've been wearing the entire time and plan to keep wearing for the rest of classic. No matter what I do he's part of it.
---
Yeah this. I'm on incendius Ally and while I still love the game, the fact that you have no options outside of being ganked repeatedly by death squads is getting old.
---
Most of our guild has drastically reduced playtime to raid nights. Naturally occurring PvP battles are perfect, even if outnumbered. Organized raids on a city are great. But waiting until the server has mc on farm and has nothing else to do 6 nights a week and then making camping fps a viable way of obtaining some of the best gear in the game is... An interesting choice.
---
I’ve seen this argument more than once. Just because you haven’t doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist
---
Just to hide the keybind of a action button. Makes it look alot cleaner imo.
---
&gt;Retail time gates things for no reason other than to keep players subscribed and draw out a small amount of content. Like, a quest chain that takes 2 hours to complete will be time gated over the span of 4-6 weeks, only allowing you to complete 20 minutes worth of it every week.
---
Same thing with classic raids.
---
&gt;Classic's "time gating" at least makes sense because it's replicating the original release schedule, and ensuring that we don't get bored with the game too quickly.
---
People are already bored with the game.
---
&gt;source: your ass
---
same thing when you said people would burn through all content in a month and quit. You're also talking out of your ass. But we can't expect much from people who can't handle an argument, yet tells others about it. Irony at its juiciest.
---
Census was fixed. Current Incendius level 60's are 53/47 horde to alliance.
---
Gonna be funny when there's no Alliance to do turn-ins to open AQ
---
That's the one! Looks like you're all set my man.
---
Do you have proof of this? If this is the case why is it only happening on a few servers?
---
Its waiting for 4 other trucks before he rams you.
---
BG queues are cross realm.
---
So they just went ahead and replicated that trash connection to everyone’s computers in classic? Lmao ok. I don’t even play hunter so I don’t care. It’s fucking awesome just walking over there traps like they don’t exist.
---
Come hang out on Pagle, Great alliance community and we are all super nice
---
My guild uses dkp and successfully made a second team and even gave them more dkp (progression bonus for first week) than main raid for a shirt period, and we now have 2 solid 40 mans, we have players swap raids occasionally for scheduling issues but there isn't gear funnelling or any crazy dkp bonus to one raid for "speedrunning" that guild you're in definitely doesn't care about team 2
---
Nice hat!
---
no changes
---
I expected ganking. I expected camping on certain points every now and then by a few bored individuals. It's what I had for Phase 1. There were fair fights, unbalanced ones, gankings from higher levels and the occasional asshole who'd camp you. That's what I played through in Vanilla. It's exactly what I expected and I enjoyed it for the most part when those who tried to gank me ended up dead. There was tons of PvP in Phase 1 and it was at the expected level. Sometimes the Horde would control a quest hub, sometimes Alliance would and the back n forth was fun.
---
Why exactly would I think the Honor system would change everything so drastically from Phase 1? I expected there to be far more skirmishes in contested zones instead of Horde and Alliance quietly questing next to one another, for certain. I expected less city raids because people would be afraid of DKs. I even figured people would camp less because of degrading honor from a single target. No point in camping someone after 3 kills.
---
Why in the world would I think Horde would make raid groups to sit at flight points and instance spots when previously there had been no such thing? There's no point to it either because Honor decays, yet they sit in the exact same spots killing the exact same people over and over again for no honor.
---
Petition to add batching to retail
---
Where is a good place to farm runecloth? I feel like they nerfed the droprate globally... and the only good place to farm it is in dungeons
---
I mean, I’m on a different server (and I play Horde) but I’ve been taking a break recently with all these other game releases lately. I still love classic and I’m staying subbed, but I haven’t played more than 20~ minutes in the last week. I’ll come back eventually, but there are plenty of other games (and responsibilities, I guess) vying for my attention right now.
---
I didn't want to roll on a PVP server but everyone I know did so it was either solo it, or deal with the nonsense. I can't be the only one in this situation. Compounding the issue is that my friends play more, so now they're just raid logging while I'm trying to grind out the last few levels.
---
Thats because uldaman is essentially 2 dungeons, thus the backdoor.
---
Pt1. Outside + the bosses leading up to and including Auriya.
---
Pt2. Backdoor, fireman, stone man and then Archaedus
---
Grimlok can go either way.
---
The real problem is the server population, not being on a PvP server.
---
SALT
---
I am a quitter to another server. F U Billyjoe.
---
Yes, but what started this argument was that crit is better on locks than mages. It isn't yet, unless the mage has to lose hit for the crit.
---
World enlarger and gadgeztan transporter requires active gnomish engineering so do not bother crafting them if you're switching
---
What? World/server first racers are learning on the fly (and whatever was datamined) and using weakauras at most. DBM doesn't typically have the entire raid, let alone heroic/mythic mechanics down yet. And what another guild does has nothing to do with you. A player killing you with an addon definitely does.
---
Is there something I'm missing about the fun in raids? I'm a level 60 prot warrior. Most of the fun in the game for me comes from tanking dungeons and, as weird as it may sound, tanking pugs. I like having to coordinate with people I don't know, adapting to the way each other play and pulling through. A large part of my enjoyment in runs comes from managing to get a smooth run out of that: nice pulls, holding aggro, clear communication on what is happening next (as much as chat allows to, anyways). Main tanking UBRS pug runs and making them work is by far the most fun I've ever had in WoW.
---
However, now that I'm starting to raid (offtank) I'm getting no enjoyment out of it. I get that by going I get the chance to get some incredible loot, but the process of getting it is really "meh" as far as I've experienced it. All the other people do the work and I'm just flailing around dealing wet noodle damage, maybe tank some ads or taunt some boss here and there, that's it. I feel like I'm just chilling and getting carried. No calls, no pulls, no main tanking, no directions; just do what the raid leader says. Which, by the way, to some extent is what I ask of other players when running through dungeons. 
---
So, point is: I'm not enjoying raiding at all. Would probably be a bit better if I MT it but don't have enough knowledge of the raids to direct 40 people. I just don't even feel like joining them anymore. What am I missing?
---
It should settle down A LOT on 10 December. I personally will go back to being docile towards alliance save for when fighting for mining nodes.
---
Life (Work/Family) balance and this game is impossible.
---
I took two days off and did nothing but grind.  I was the highest level Paladin on my server at 40 hours after launch.  I went to work, came home, played with my kids, signed on, I'm 10 levels behind.  2 weeks later and there is no hope.  I can't even quest, every quest objective is littered with horde.  I move to dungeons and decide to reroll heal to get faster groups, works great, until I need to do quests again.  I can't quest as a healer. Horde seem to think they are high skill when they gank me questing and I start spamming heal on myself until I die.  Then they camp me.  I signed off after maybe 20-30 minutes for weeks because I would sign on, kill 5-7 quest mobs and then get killed and camped.  Literally camped, horde is just running around mounted up waiting for me to spawn.  I gave it 10 minutes and they are still there, I have better shit to do than sit around dead.
---
This is #NoChanges in action. Blizzard did not promote faction balance in vanilla wow and thus didn't in classic, they were afraid to do that in classic lest they be accused of sticking their hands in the cookie jar.
---
Lmao
---
Private server owners made a fuck ton of changes. Riot made no changes.
---
I'm playing on Grobbulus, which is a very balanced server.
---
Until now I thought GatherMate only showed nodes that you had already collected, but I just googled it and a module with prefilled nodes apparently exists... either way this can also be used for monster and item spawns so it wasn't a complete waste of time
---
Consumables aren’t the difference in a 1 and 3 hour clear. People being competent is. The majority of your time is spent on trash or just plain running through the instance. Even if consumables increased DPS by 25% across the board (they don’t), you’d maybe clear 15% faster. Bosses dying in 50 seconds versus 40 doesn’t save all that much time. But farming flasks sure as hell does take a lot of time.
---
Naw they posted about this ages ago, we're only just now getting the message.
---
I hope you are right, but I have my doubts.
---
The ultratryharding, then the content being rushed out, then the megaultratryharding to gather up the scraps, ruined Classic. It's been about a week since I logged in, and I doubt I'll be back, since I'd just be farther behind. I guess I'm realizing that as an adult it's not that fun to play a multiplayer game with 20-year-old sociopaths.
---
5% chance to miss spells would be way more OP than the orc racial. It would mean your opponent has to itemize for 5% more hit... That would be some actually bullshit. Making NELF racial like it is in retail would be more sensible, but I think that's also a bit too strong as it essentailly works as an extra vanish.
---
I'm in a similar position, according to wowclassicpopulation (take it as you will) even the PvE servers are severely imbalanced. Pagle &amp; Westfall Alliance and Mankrik Horde. Not that it matters as much as it does on PvP, but I'm looking at Ashkandi as my new server. 58/42 Alliance.
---
The time to buy was two months ago. The time to sell is now. Tons of people did this right and have bank alts loaded with those items you listed that they sniped from noob classic players who didn't know what they were selling. 
---
I probably spent a good 30-50g back in September on about 20 items. Worth now a few hundred gold. But their prices will drop as there will be a surplus on the AH as everyone tries to sell too.
---
Hell you might be smart on buying a few pieces once prices plummet. Aim to resell them in a few months time when the surplus disappears.
---
If i were you, I would drop tailoring instead of enchanting. Once you get some good recipes, you can be huge for your guild and make some money as well. Tailoring isn't that good until phase 4. I would pick up either herbalism or mining depending on what your usual farms are.
---
Don't recall which is which but there are two options. Half lit up on mouseover, and fully lit up. I mean the pages part of the book, not the covers.
---
Zoom in fully and it is very easy to distinguish.
---
I can smell you.
---
Zandalar EU, been a fair fight altho ally is a bit more dominant.
---
Both Census and Ironforge peg Benediction as at least 60% horde.
---
i'd rather take the average player that shows up every time than the good player that is showing up 1 a month 
---
no question about it even
---
You merge the imbalanced servers together to balance them.
---
Yea it really hurts when you don’t have warlock support out there.
---
"Get honor from camping" ... I quit before p2 because I was getting corpse camped.  There wasn't even honor in the game, I'm heal spec'd trying to kill some quest mobs and I can't even do it.  Horde 3-5 levels higher, sometimes 10 levels higher just kill you for no reason.  I spam heal on myself, I don't fight, there's no point.  If they were the same level and brain dead, sure I can win a 1v1 as a healer...
---
Spoiler alert, there is nothing at the end except entering a patch of ocean name "Gillijim's Isle"
---
Okay how did you get 50g at 29.. teach me your ways. What exactly are you selling?
---
I dont get why ppl hide their abilities
---
"Balanced servers" were also ruined by superdupertryhard sociopaths.
---
I can understand that. I got downvoted (lul) but it's the truth. I don't think people really understood everything a pvp server entailed, even though various streamers/youtubers said this is what would happen. It'll hopefully get better once BGs come out but I still think those locations will be hotspots for honor/camping. I don't feel there is a real fix besides faction coordination
---
If you’re a dps with a plate set you can spec arms and go with a healer and 2 man it. One of our warriors did that with a shammy and had a deal something like all BoP items and essence of fire to shammy to vendor/AH, all BoEs split, SGC dropped 100 gold to shammy for helping grind it out.
---
Edit; also a warrior, and I just tanked it in a group of 4 with no muppets that would roll on it. Hunters who wanted my BiS until AQ weren’t taking it for “pre-BiS” when there’s other options for them, enhance shamans weren’t invited.
---
breh chill man
---
You want feline swiftness 110% ASAP.  Beyond that, getting any bear based skills is fine as many of them serve some purpose in car as well. It’s how I leveled my Druid to 60 and had a great time tanking every single dungeon in the game while leveling and now at 60.
---
Running at 0/30/21 HotW spec and loving it.  Let’s me effectively tank or heal any 5 or 10 man in the game and good in pvp also.  Strongly suggest it.
---
Are you just farming people landing at flight points? You don’t get honor for those kills.
---
its not a gank when you land at fp and there is 40 ppl waiting lol.
---
Or I'm someone who joined a guild as it started instead of expecting to jump in to one with the place already on farm. We started out with about 28 people in greens and blues and worked up from there.
---
Do we need any of that stuff now? Nope. I still have it though, it costs almost nothing, is made back in minutes, and ensures a smooth run.
---
I get it, you want to be carried through the entire game and scoff about how easy it is. Have fun, seriously.
---
This is how wow has always been
---
Shadowcraft+devilsaur is your preBiS, however, as soon as you get raid gear and start replacing more than 3 pieces of shadowcraft and lose the 4-set, it's not nearly as good as stacking more crit and AP.
---
Yeah, not sure if balance means anything on a PvE server, as I have never played on one. I would think with BGs being cross realm that it won't matter much. I guess the side with more players will have a bigger pull of players to pull from for raids and stuff. With how Blizzard allowed so many more people on servers, but didn't allow more respawns on resources (looking at Black Lotus), I also wonder if a medium pop server will be better.
---
I am sad to hear. I rolled Alliance on Thunderfury and for several reasons I did not stay past the first month, but it never felt imbalanced in Hillsbrad where I was active.
---
I just resubbed not knowing what the game was going through and died for 2 hours straight trying to  get to ony and then mc on Sulfuras Ally. Why the fuck did they remove layering??
---
It won’t even make a dent. If you’re horde you’re able to play the game, alliance cannot, so why switch?
---
I made a toon for all my names on the free transfer realm and would sign in to check the status but even the 3 realms I could transfer to were horde heavy.  Not to mention low pop is so tedious when it comes to get groups or a decent raid group late game.  I have very limited schedules and do to some bullshit during name reservation I got into a west coast server by accident and couldn't switch to another server.  Queues were bugged and shit so I just made the toon and left.  There was a guild of players who had good raid times for me, but after DM dropped they all either transferred or rerolled horde.
---
dm trib
---
ur an idiot
---
I was 52 when it launched. I am now 55 and have probably died to most horde on my server. I am on a break playing retail and other games while I wait for BGs to come out.
---
PvP servers were more fun when I had the time and will to put in more hours. I am too casual for this :D
---
The daily heroic was probably my favorite part of TBC.  It was nice having dungeons stay relevant even after people got all the drops they needed from them.
---
Lol just my luck, both of the servers I’m on my faction is drastically underpopulated. I’m on one of the few where horde are outnumbered and of course my alliance characters are outnumbered as well.
---
Are the bosses "low level" do they have a level or are they that weird boss level. I don't imagine they are actually low level like your friend claims but don't know enough to be certain.
---
How dare people want to have fun playing a game!
---
LUL XD
---
honestly dude youre kinda being a little nanny here
---
Ashkandi is nice, good population and some decent players. If you're joining guilds for raiding, I'd suggest one of the recruiting ones, since the established ones can have some cliques.
---
You can raid in greens/blues with the shittiest spec ever and complete it.
---
You don't need to respec every week.
---
How about this fucking faction bullshit.
---
Put up a god damn faction que
---
Name reservations was a shit show, I got bounced to a different server and I didn't even know it happened.  The queue was hours long and when it signed me in, I was in a different server and couldn't get through queues to a better server.  Launch was no better.
---
I'm mostly fighting at the pass at Kargath
---
305 you have a 6% hit cap even as a hunter. If you're missing it's caused by something else. Maybe you forgot to equip 1% hit?
---
You can google "world of warcraft patch notes" and read about it yourself on wowwiki if, for some reason, you are choosing to challenge and/or reject widely known common knowledge.
---
Got a source?
---
Ty!!
---
But muh parses
---
If you played in vanilla the pvp servers here are nothing like they were in true vanilla lmao
---
I think my server in Vanilla had like 1000-1500 players and I never felt the server was dead back then and always had people to run dungeons with.
---
Having that amount of players just looking for people to gank is kinda nuts.
---
The problem is that even on balanced servers Alliance doesn't seem to participate as much as horde in wPvP.
---
I play Horde because I prefer their lore, racials aren't as important to everyone as you suggest.
---
Oh, yeah, stats actually hint at Alliance, but almost  50/50.  I'll see if I can xfer but I don't have time to reroll 1-60 again, not to mention fishing/cooking/engineering/mining almost all maxed.
---
Why is soft results bad for new players?
---
The group I run with does a soft res with people rolling on items if more than one res'd.
---
It makes it so vets have a high chance of getting the one item they need and you can just look at the sheet to know exactly what is going to happen with the loot.
---
Lvl alts on your sever spending on how casually you play you can get back to your mains when BGs hit and the alts will be getting to contested zones
---
I have HoJ but not using it until I’m hit capped. Use rune guard captain one and the 2% crit...
---
You didn't play on a pvp server back in vanilla did you lol?
---
This does seem to be more than a display bug as I ran into that often due to play times, but honorspy was always accurate.  This week I'm missing roughly 50k honor from both the honor tab and honorspy hasn't updated properly for me since 11/27.
---
I have no idea what standing I am, if my kills are being counted etc. Basically writing this week off as a loss at this point since I have no idea if I will hit the bracket needed for next rank.
---
Do not regret getting the trinket. Mentioning this I will be argued against as guides and general opinion think threat wins always. Yes, threat has its value but so does mitigation.
---
The trinket will be a BIS (mitigation) for just as long as the neck will be bis (threat) 
---
and then you will still use the neck in Nax. The +1 to parry is rare enough to be unique. It is the first mitigation chance counter on the physical hit received roll.
---
"No changes."
---
Sub ends in half a week anyhow. I'll consider coming back if they open transfers to PVE, otherwise it has been a good run and I'm off to try FFXIV.
---
Not on hand. But I'm sure it can be found.
---
But source aside. Common sense says no lol. Because it didn't work that way in vanilla
---
For sure, it's super easy and in my experience, there's a lot more tribal, than dragonscale LWers around! (Due to devilsaur) With that said, there's been a massive market crash because there's so many.
---
Why would you waste your time doing that? You can live without a job, no house, no car, or any modern essentials but should you?
---
You can do Tribute runs in Raid spec.
---
Hey, if everyone in the raid is cool with that, more power to em. In my experience, that's a good way to piss off 15-20 people for wasting their time. I'm not as hardcore as some of my guildmates, but forget wiping. Our RL gets frustrated when too many people die and we have to stop to rez. Fine by me tho. In and out in less than  an hour
---
I've made the decision to quit. This is solely due to the PvP system but it plays a big role. :(
---
I’m certain crit is better on warlocks versus mage because winters chill exists. So mages want hit right now to benefit from winters chill and warlock curse even more.
---
How often do you in real life over spend on something simply because you didn't look elsewhere first?
---
Why? Did you read the OP? lmao.
---
Or are you under the impression that I meant that you should SWAP TO GREEN GEAR?
---
you gotta get honor spy to show up on honor spy
---
The census mod is still going to give you the most accurate results. The only thing that broke for it was the automatic scanning, an that was fixed in a few days. Ironforge only shows you the demographic for raiders on your server, whereas census will show you the nonraiders camping your FP 24/7 too. Census shows Benediction at 75% horde overall, and 65% for just 60s.
---
I run [this spec](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/hunter/3-05251030513051-332020041002) for both DMT and raiding. A run for me takes about 15 minutes, with room for improvement. Learn to properly send your pet so you can outrange it and not make it die so much.
---
Not OP but here's mine (and probably a lot of other people's) take: 
---
I really enjoyed PvP in Phase 1 and massively underestimated how bad it would be in Phase 2, which is entirely my fault. It's not that I can't take being ganked, but everyone has a limit. 
---
I'd like to switch server but I don't have the option to do that and I don't have the time that I did when Classic launched to play catch-up with myself, so I just don't play.
---
It's my fault that I am in this situation, but considering the amount of people that seem to feel a similar way it adds up to a lot of lost revenue for Blizzard which makes it just as much their problem as it is mine.
---
Loot Council almost inevitably leads to guild drama.
---
Essentially, you end up with three major issues:  
---
1. Loot Council plays favorites. This is simply human nature and it's happened in every Loot Council I've ever seen. They claim they're "rewarding the best players", but it inevitably means they're rewarding the players they like more for reasons that have nothing to do with the guild's success.  
---
2. Loot Council is dumb. It may *seem* like the ready of availability of "BiS Lists" means everyone knows what everyone needs for gear, but this just isn't the case. Most of those lists are structured around specific assumptions that may not hold in a particular case and none of them are particularly good at prioritizing which pieces to loot to obtain. Having someone else decide for you what your priorities is not a good scheme.  
---
3. Opaque loot distribution. In a DKP (or even rotation) system, you know ahead of time what's happening. There's no nasty surprises. You don't get all excited about a loot drop only to find out it's going to the GM's girlfriend.
---
Loot Council can potentially work when you've got a small group of people who have been playing together for a while. This doesn't describe virtually any guild in Classic, where you're mounting multiple 40-man raids. If a guild says they're Loot Council, it should be a hard 'nope' from any decent player.
---
This. Wish we had actual vanilla pop caps and more servers.
---
I’ve noticed a huge uptick in alliance lvl 30s etc on our pve server. Seems likely people are just rerolling pve
---
I think you only need 4% hit. Just look at the full pvp gear set to for benchmark
---
&gt; Not overly Horde dominant.
---
Every census or demographic site shows Bene at least 60% Horde. Census shows it at 75%.
---
Just googling for "warrior tank BIS classic" gives me this wowhead guide as the first result:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/warrior-tank-gear-bis-classic-wow
---
Your guildies are completely wrong and some basic research would show them that
---
Quit. Halo Reach comes out soon.
---
No, im in my 30s.  Look up 30 year old boomer.  Wow classic is a peak 30 yr old boomer game.
---
Sort us a 300 foot cock &amp; balls escort for tomorrow yeah? xD
---
Ya... pve server here. Legit rerolling my lvl 60 hunter to orc female for bc prep. Love me some orc
---
No one disputes that Heartseeker exists.  
---
Its just \*the only one\* where Alliance run the train. Most people saying "Alliance dominate my server, its like 60/40 Ally!" are from servers where thats demonstrably false with, you know, actual numbers instead of anecdotes.
---
Also need more horde numbers on Atiesh, feels pretty empty compared to alliance. Must be crazy unbalanced. Thankfully I can still level in peace in pve
---
Good advice, I also would recommend PMing people when they mess up, putting them on blast in front of the whole raid group can be humiliating and causes people to behave definsively. I've noticed people take on advice much better when you PM them nicely
---
That can be arranged 😂😂
---
Honestly off tanking is boring. I'm in the same boat, I love tanking in dungeons but a lot of raid fights I'm just weak DPS along for the ride. If you're used to leading, sitting aside can be a snooze fest.
---
Personally, I'm trying to learn as much as possible so I can take lead on raid nights.
---
Not only raiders but a smaller section of the raiders who actually care to log.
---
They need to offer pvp to pve Xfers for alliance. Maybe horde to alliance faction changes also.
---
Because the horde are perpetually being toxic assholes.  It's not PVP.
---
Horde player camping alliance cities with spy, half his buttons unbound, auto attack still on the bars.
---
Not trying to trash you too hard my guy but im not surprised in the slightest
---
Yep
---
What about ice barbed spear?
---
Good lord you're dim.
---
The sheer number of people means there is \*nowhere\* that isn't camped. In Vanilla, if the enemy held a zone, you just went to another. Now \*every fucking zone\* is camped, nimrod. And even if one isn't, good fucking luck getting there since the flightmaster is dead and the boat and pier have raids on them.
---
I've had other Alliance say that to me when I'm in LFG asking if literally anyone can help me get the fuck out of a zone without dying. Like, yeah. I'll just learn to kill 5 level 60s when I'm a level 48. Let me get right on it. lol
---
There’s a couple big guilds that control zones occasionally on alliance. I have seen 4-5 people gank squads running constantly by either sides in SG. 
---
For world bosses I have seen hurricane and co get quite a few kills while denying final boss. 
---
That being said searing gorge is either completely run by death squads from alliance or horde and there are usually a rogue or two at most high level FPS as well as rachets fp. 
---
Plenty of rogues in menethil, usually the same suspects. 
---
There are usually a few 60s running around the lvl 48-60 zones looking for lowbies for free honor. 
---
I haven’t had too much of an issue getting into BRM but burning steppes is usually camped pretty hard.
---
25% is broken, nerf it to 10%
---
You're seriously underestimating the mobility of mounted Spy-enabled gank squads.
---
Please report how this went.
---
But if you've had all current raid content on farm for over a month like every sub par or better guild, who tf cares?
---
Hey man, hunter here that’s been doing a lot of research on it.
---
Just like the comment above if I was troll I wouldn’t spend the $. Until 8/8 Giantstalker I recommend sitting at 6/7 hit % as troll.... once you have the full set you may need to equip a scope unless you can get your hands on a band of accuria which is hard to do in a competitive guild as a hunter. Just depends on what you have access to
---
I'm on Atiesh and I can absolutely help you guys out. I also just switched from pvp to pve and I am loving how calm I can be again.
---
ironic that alliance cry about this and then destroy another balanced server by transferring to it
---
Horde flair checks out.
---
Pretty cool how people can play a game, make other people quit playing or lock them into nonsense, and then brag on a third party app.
---
Manly af. 
---
Keep growing that epeen.
---
In a way, sure, but the point here is that it isn't necessarily easier for one faction to farm honor than the other. On average I'd guess that both sides have to spend roughly the same amount of time for any given bracket, because while one side has an easier time finding people to kill this applies to every player of that faction. Obviously, the amount of honor required for each bracket will differ by faction, but likely not the effort required.
---
Pretty cool! My buddy has this cookbook too and he has tried some of the recipe's and loved them
---
I always play the underdog but playing wow classic as alliance is suicide. Only the most masochistic will try and win against the hordies.
---
And Horde are dominant on all but 1 PvP server. Your point?
---
Well, it is actually a nightmare for us that are just trying to level up, i lost my last 7 days of game time just by trying to quest at STV, dude it is impossible. I just keep getting ganked over and over, they dont even let me respawn. It was so annoying dude. Even in the morning.
---
I’m worried about this happening when I hit 60 on my warrior. Tanking dungeons and managing multiple mobs is the most fun part of the game. I feel like I won’t get to experience this when raid tanking
---
I´m curious about the results, and how it matches what I have seen over the years. E.g. In all the years I have played I met exactly two girls who play male characters, but who knows maybe there are a lot more? What irks me a little bit is, that I´m probably contributing to a large chunk of women playing healers. But I started playing a pally during vanilla, with no idea what my role was going to be later, and of course I ended up as a healer..
---
Same as you ya idiot. 
---
You’re saying hunters don’t need their Pre BiS so why should warriors get HoJ over hunters getting SGC
---
Sounds to me like you need to go to your officers and say 'I'm happy to offtank, but let me know when we're organising a B-team raid and I'll do everything I can to help".
---
Won't matter because Horde queues are going to be hilariously long.
---
That's where faction queues come in. The first comment said it.
---
About 2 years worth of patch notes
---
Then they cry about being hunted down like dogs. And don't you dare steam PvP against other streamers. You'll get the ban hammer for just playing the game...
---
Hey man, some of these dudes need all the help they can get!
---
It's not like TBC dailies were shoved down your throat. They did cause a bunch of gold inflation though so yeah not perfect but even then that didn't get out of hand until sunwell.
---
this, and this is why our group raids tuesday and wednesday so we get 13 days of w/e you feel like
---
I'm on grob and honestly it's pretty good for alliance AND horde.  Constant tug of war, always have groups being setup to pvp.
---
Lots of people have heard of Gillijim's Isle but not many know that the zone trigger (what shows on /who) and the general channels were kept in the game. If you swim all the way out there you can "discover" it and zone into gillijim's isle yourself.

You seriously overestimate your intelligence if you think the gank squad is chasing 1 person from EPL to Winterspring. In Vanilla, you just went where the PvP wasn't. If it popped off, you left again.  
---
These gank squads aren't going to different continents every five minutes, dingus.
---
&gt; Looking forward to BGs both to play in them so I can farm honor the 'real' way and so I can actually like go out in the world and do stuff normally.
---
Horde will still be camping between BG queues since it's better honor than waiting to get in.
---
I love playing as the underdog in PlanetSide 2. That exp bonus is so good especially combined with 2xp weekend
---
Yeah, I'm not seeing it as a big deal as there's still some decent necks around. The neck is just far better for what I'm trying to accomplish, in the long run.
---
Iq80 solutions for an IQ10 problem
---
Well at 80 IQ you're probably still smarter than Blizzard, so tell 'em to put paid transfers in.
---
No.
---
Best helm/legs enchant for a mage? I have the ony helm and I'm not sure if I should go for the +8 int or +8 SP. Which do you think would be best as I'll be using it for both pve and pvp?
---
Well I wish you the very best with your raid roaming around an empty Ironforge looking for that one guy you care about "fighting".
---
I hope his name is Magni Bronzebeard because at this rate, you're gonna be shit out of luck finding anyone else there.
---
&gt; That's just sad.
---
Their life is sad.
---
Oh, it's a problem.
---
It's just not the main problem, which is that relative numbers count in warfare, and losing is not fun.
---
It's not that simple, usually rolling on a server is a big decision with a huge time investment. All of my friends have rolled here and have invested hundreds of hours each, we're not willing to just throw that all away and would rather just quit the game than deal with the toxic shitshow that is world pvp.
---
What makes you think that person is going to play retail?

---
Go to retail with your warmode toggle
---
you raid on a tuesday(last day of the week) and then wednesday(first day of the week) so you clear 2 weeks worth of raids in 2 days. So you can be free to be what spec u want until tuesday the week after, 13 days.
---
If you say so
---
Right now? Not a big deal. You have a max of 3% hit total IF you wear felheart robes which are pretty trash. I wear the belt because i haven't picked up a replacement in MC yet, but the vectus neck is 100% better than star of mystaria atm. Importance of hit changes for us later on.

only solution is to play more

Why not just re roll on PvE? Nothing's stopping you.
---
"Plays on 60/40 or worse server" basically another free spot...
---
Yeah farmed their own community.
---
PVP servers on any game have been like this for decades.  Anonymous players generally have no sense of pride or integrity. 
---
It's so freaking ironic that it's called honor, when you'll be losing side if you actually play with honor.
---
melee dies because there is no tank with aggro in melee range when he does wrath of ragnaros.
---
melee should wait until the boss starts hitting A tank again before you step in to avoid dying.
---
if there is nobody in melee when rag wants to hit somebody hes gonna fuck up some random range person, but thats not your job as a melee to deal with, its the tanks problem.
---
Yeah I don't disagree from a fun perspective, but in terms of effort I have a hard time imagining alliance having a lower playtime threshold for the higher brackets. If anything, I'd expect the thresholds to be higher just because they have more fun grinding pvp, so they're more likely to do it for 12+ hours a day.

---
When there's only about 6 endgame zones that people use consistently the difference between having 400 people pvping and having 4000 people pvping spread between the zones is massive in terms of coverage and lopsidedness of the fights.
---
 Yup, there should have been no layers from the start either. Created false sense of stability. The maxed out servers should have just been removed from the list. On Herod, It takes about 45 mins for the ony buff to drop in org Tuesdays around 630. Shits rediculous
---
It is the main problem.
---
The world is the same size it was in Vanilla.
---
There are (presumably) up to 4-5 times as many people on the big servers like Herod and Whitemane.
---
Ratios being the same, its a lot easier to play when there are, say, 1,000 Horde out in the world.There will be holes in the coverage.
---
Now there are 5,000 Horde out in the world. There is effectively no place you can go where you won't be drowned in Horde bodies. This also plays into actual fighting.
---
Can 10 beat 20? With better skill and coordination, sure. Can 20 beat 40? Less likely. Can 40 beat 80? Not all 60/40 servers are the same. Theres a breaking point for numbers where no amount of skill is going to trump numbers.
---
Because people are morons that slurp streamer cock.
---
maybe this was the plan.

---
As someone mentioned above. Raid leading. Either look for a guild in need of a raid leader or take control of raid team 2/alt raid of your current guild. If organizing large groups of players is your thing, do it! People will thank you in the end.
---
Raid content on farm become trivial very quickly. If your group understand this, they will show up for the social interaction. Not the lewt.
---
Sounds like the guild lead doesn’t really want to manage two groups, or knows how. I wouldn’t say it’s malicious or ‘abuse’, probably just inexperienced leadership. Also sounds like the guild is having a surge of popularity and moving too fast. The proper response would be to make group 2 exclusive and maybe just make a new guild, but if you can’t form a solid 40, you’re probably in a deep bench for R1.
---
Yeah idk why you’re downvoted. Alliance own the plague lands and horde generally owns BRD on sulfuras during peak hours. Non peak hours the ownership swaps. Fucking renray the rest paladin is always camping BRD with friends.
---
if u belive in numbers what the blizzard gave us...
---
So use the other entrance
---
Having a warrior main I've decided to play a class that removes magic. I'm loving my priest!
---
Faction queues on weekends. Most raid teams are unaffected since they will finish their raids earlier in the week. Minority faction has a time period where the over world is fair ish. Majority faction has no queues 4/7 days a week, and can still play weekends once they finish the queue.
---
+SP if the item is a long term keeper (so, netherwind crown) I'd do int otherwise and use it as a pvp helm
---
yeah i Mean that.. dunno what its called in english, while the buff is activ you wont give honor... and yeah people are so dumb and kill you more then once when you can keep the buff up... but yeah I was only there to turn a quest in... so...
---
It’s a raiding guild... not sure if they are 10/10 MC or not, but we used to run with them in our early MC raids.
---
My bad forgot to respond sooner. I did murlocs in azshara at 55 I think. After that I went to silithus. This was also my alt so I had really good gear the whole time so I was able to go to silithus a little early. Krol blade, devisaur other random blue boes. It was miserable lol.
---
Well yeah, why renew yourself sub if you can’t really play the game?  Makes perfect sense for a drop off now.
---
Downranking spells m8
---
It's more so about the lower to mid ranks. You can play normally as Alliance and the amount of PvP you'll come across just when you're out doing things will be enough to get you a few ranks. This is supported by the fact that most every alliance I come across, no matter their level, is at least rank 1 whereas it's rare to find horde with a rank of they don't actively PvP.
---
F
---
Horde will continue to gank 24/7, that won't change. 
---
The only thing that changes is the amount of people who are now able to rank decreases by about 1000%.  If you're not in the two top premades you can wave goodbye to getting ranks.
---
Yes
---
Is it possible to never miss with Autoshot for hunters? Assuming the answer is yes, I have the following questions:  
---
With 300 Weapon Skill - how much hit do you need for autoshot to never miss?  
---
Same question but with 305 weapon skill?  
---
Thanks!
---
Because they all server transferred after getting rocked by horde or are too busy ERPing in ironforge
---
Do other servers not have their own subreddits?  I figured Herod would have one too.
---
What I’m trying to say is that the solution needs to be equally fair for both sides and I still haven’t seen one that is. Simply transferring the issues/problems from one faction to the other (whether it’s alliance or horde players) isn’t a solution
---
Every post like this fills me with joy, all these idiots farming lowbies over and over and getting nothing for it. Everyone loses and wastes time.
---
Ah I am mistaken. And yet the add on still functions :(
---
Wait for the 10th when BGs will be out. It'll go back to the vanilla you remember when the open world isn't overrun by edgelords competing to get rank 3.
---
You can play classic on any current laptop or desktop id say. No need to break the bank if you’re primarily playing WoW
---
That's the life of an off tank in raids.  If you're not the main offtank that is at the ready for rag or to step in as main if your normal main needs to step away a second so you take over leading it can definitely be boring in raid and feel like a carry even though you still play an important role.  If you are 3rd or 4th tank I would suggest going full fury dps with the understanding when needed you pop on tank gear to get that mob for garr or domo or wherever needed.  I kind of dual main with our guild leader, usually I am main but either of us can, both fire capped for rag etc.  We have a third and fourth that are fury/arms they pick up ads when needed just throw on tank gear then.  Otherwise they get to dps so I would think it is enough of a switcheroo to not get boring for them.  Just talk with your guild on what would work best or ask to rotate into main tank now and then at least if you have the gear also.  You're main tank might appreciate a break anyways.
---
All that being said tanking is still boring for every fight in raids.  It's all single target and really easy.  I have fun by trying to chain pull and just keep everything moving fast and making those pulls clean. You can check logs and try to increase your dps to get better parses, you can balance more mitigation in if threat is never an issue or more threat gear in if it is but the life of the tank is to protect the family.  A lot of roles in classic are pretty boring though more like mini games.  On my mage I just stand there blasting fb's and staring at damage meters for fun or watching for big crits.  It's just about getting that good gear and if your guild doesn't face roll the fights it is exciting the first time you down those bosses.  Also it is just like 4 hours a week of your game time going to raids so worth it for the gear even if it's not your thing.  In later raids more mechanics come into play that make it a little more fun no matter the role.
---
Ramble ended or I just keep going.  Keep at it bro and find what you like.
---
You guys are just missing the nice phrasing. Think of the context, they're giving health potions away-- literally life
---
Live to fight and runaway *life* to fight another day
---
It's owned by Activision, don't kid yourself.
---
&gt;If a guild says they're Loot Council, it should be a hard 'nope' from any decent player.
---
90% or more of the top tier guilds(apes, onslaught, progress etc) use LC.  Its a simple fact that LC is the better and vastly preferred loot system among strong veteran players.
---
&gt; Wouldn't surprise me at all to see a solid 3 take on a group of 5 or more, if they had a ~~well geared warrior and a good healer~ mage
---
I would recommend you build off a Ryzen 3 3200G. It's Vega 8 graphics are more than enough to run Classic smoothly and will save you some space and money on not needing a gpu.
---
I'm currently using a flex14 for travel. Using it for work and playing, it has a Ryzen 3500U and works wonderfully.
---
Blaster is bis for pvp
---
The steamers amuse me more than anybody, the game they're playing is *nothing* like the game anybody else is playing today.. forget the experience 15 years ago.
---
Woot for PvE realms! Amazing people, and, honestly, the greatest time I've ever had in the game had coincidentally come after P2 released. The game is totally different from PvP realms at the moment, and is such an awesome thing to experience.
---
No idea what most comments here are on about, they seem to be missing the question.
---
All raid bosses are counted as level 63. They show as ??
---
You only need 6% hit and a bow to be hit capped for everything as troll. What were your misses with? You could still miss an auto attack, raptor strike etc, youre only hit capped on ranged shots. Could also be your pet missing, cant hit cap your pet.
---
Logs also show immunes and other things as misses, make sure to hover over it
---
Im a troll hunter raiding with 6% and rhok, never miss in a raid
---
they banned a certain way to do who querries, the census guys found a more mechanical way to do it
---
so it is as accurate as it was the last years
---
i don't get this, if a person is sitting there AFK they're not gonna have any actions to appear in the combat log, but spy will still find them right?
---
If youre a bad rogue youll blow vanish. Last I recall though, CS literally does no damage and it being resisted means no damage is being done either.  
---
So no cd needs to be used.
---
1% hit to a warlock is worth 18 spell power (might be 19 cant remember off the top of my head).  1% crit and 1% hit are also interchangeable to a warlock.
---
You absolutely need basic consumables to do a sub 3hr MC clear even as full 40 man of 60s.
---
You should be able to start in Tanaris and do ZF comfortably at 46
---
I love it :)
---
I'm very aware of how the add-on works pre and post combat log changes. I never introduced the fairness of it in use as I frankly don't care. If you're gonna use that argument then no one should be using classic cast bar as well because without it you would have no idea what some one was casting. Spy is an add-on that you either have because you use it to get a jump on people or you use it to stay ahead of the others that have it so you don't get jumped on. It's a more streamline track humanoids for every class, it just adds an easy /target command for you.
---
its 100% cheating...and I love it
---
awe poor lil guy it will be ok you can gank someone else.
---
You should always bring some consumables. Otherwise you're being carried by those who do bring them and you're lazy.
---
They dont call it Molten Bore for no reason.  Try to avoid the burnout for the next few months until BWL launches.  Although the really fun shit doesnt kick in until AQ and naxx.
---
... yes uhh I most certainly do this
---
I didnt know that, I was just ready to stop people from resisting my stuff
---
Classic is going to be out for years... You won't be behind on gear, because gear is always easy to get. You're turning down having fun in the game because of your fear of missing out, but you're missing out because of your fear of missing out.
---
Trust me: reroll to level 15 (just 10 hours if you're a slow leveler like me), and see if you don't have fun. Come to [Atiesh](https://www.reddit.com/r/Atiesh), and experience how WoW *should* be enjoyed: as a nice relaxing game, not a source of stress like PvP servers are.
---
BGs are only a matter of days away. I fully expect that all the gankers and griefers will be queuing nonstop into BGs.
---
And we'll start seeing complaints here "world pvp is now non-existent".
---
Nope, all alliance left. It's just horde now. No more pvp for anyone.
---
Ah, nope.  Anyone who has played this game on both sides know Horde has far more exclusives than Alliance.  Not sure you've had enough experience to BS this hard.
---
I'm herod horde. The only pvp I've done is in massive raid groups, either wiping out smaller groups or being wiped out by 5 mans when we dont have the numbers.
---
I dont find it interesting in the slightest.
---
Ok but I farm demonic runes and I can buy mana potions, I can not imagine them to be so expensive? I am thinking best benefit could be money saved on free action potions
---
&gt;It's so hard to find targets that you end up doing stuff your not proud of to get your gear.
---
Its not even that though..
---
I have a level 20 hunter alt, decided to goto Menethil to catch the boat to Darkshore for the ghost cat pet. 5 level 60 horde just riding around the docks for hours on end, KOS everything.
---
They get no honor from me, but I cant even get on the boat. If I do I get killed and if I res I cant make it back to my body in time before the ship leaves again and takes my corpse away.
---
Taskmaster axe?
---
No I think it will. It's really hard to find targets so they are basically forcing you to grief to get points. When BGs are in I'll PvP about the same as I did pre honor system.
---
It will also remove the biggest problem, the massive zergs of players roaming every zone. It's just not a viable way to get honor after BG's are out.
---
Only 1 person has to go queue.
---
And I'll be amazed if Horde queues are sub 20, let alone under 15.
---
If you have the twitch app, you can use that to find add-ons or "mods" as it's called in the app. From there you can find Gathermate add-on with a simple search. Doing it through the app also applies it to your game file immediately. Hopefully that helps.
---
Imo ban the addon
---
That was then, this is now. Most min/max Classic PvP players went Horde. Most streamers also went Horde, which further skews the population.
---
Blizzard's stance is that camping rooftops to avoid guards is against the rules. This isn't a "PVP HAPPENED ON A PVP SERVER" complaint, this is a "blizzard isn't enforcing their own rules" complaint.
---
There's no reason not to use cheap elixirs and food buffs. They're literally a few gold and it does make a massive difference when 40 people have them up. I agree 100% that flasks are pointless beyond your first rag kill. 
---
But we have mc on farm and as a tank I still elixir and food buff so I can do more threat so people can dps more. More dps means less heals needed. Means faster runs, less breaks, more enjoyable content.
---
Oh absolutely. It's great helping people out. PvE is definitely the way for a busy student. 
---
Level 42. Got my mount so hopefully should speed up soon. Though this is also where my memory of where to level gets fuzzy and I don't like reading guides too much lol!
---
I already rerolled from my 60 lock. I don't regret it even though I miss playing my equally top fav class... but I'm gonna wait for paid xfers before spending time on that character again
---
Edit: was Orc on a balanced server, and yet...
---
Does reflecting midair work?
---
Prob have to go back to retail. I had more fun on classic than retail by far before p2 buy the pendulum has shifted the other way now 
---
I don't mind rerolling on a pve server but my friends don't want to level again and I play this game to hang out with them.
---
&gt; 90% or more of the top tier guilds(apes, onslaught, progress etc) use LC. Its a simple fact that LC is the better and vastly preferred loot system among strong veteran players.
---
It has nothing to do with being a "strong veteran player" and everything to do with guilds that have had the same complement for years - a factor that doesn't describe the guilds 99% of players are in.
---
Honor appeared to be broken for the last few days lots of people who were ranking before weren't even playing because it appeared to be disappearing
---
Such great info, such bad delivery.
---
this did happen to horde, 14 years ago, they cried... a lot  
---
result were bloodelves to lure more kind of players to horde
---
Well, the data is conclusive: Alliance can't hack it in classic and should go back to retail.
---
You're literally just talking out of your ass lol. 
---
Cross-realms are ***designed*** to merge low pop servers and faction imbalanced servers together so that the players have a great pool to draw from. 
---
Racials do not make a difference unless you're the top .01% of the player population going for world firsts.

When travelling, I play classic on a 8 year old laptop with an i7 3.2 GHz CPU and a mobile 620m gt and 8GB of DDR3.
---
It only gets 15-20fps, but that's old hardware in a heat limited laptop format. Any current or last years i5 processors, or current amd ryzen cpu and  a 8GB of ram and a mediocre video care will get you 60 FPS no problem.
---
Blizzards always been fantastic at optimizing their engines to let older pcs get the most out of their games.
---
Is AOE not affected by the reflect mechanic?
---
Exactly, this is against TOS, but because the population disparity between alliance and horde is pretty huge, there is a crap ton of them camping. Too many for us to report, no matter how much we try. Nothing is happening
---
I never invite hunters to arena run.  Most even want to roll on hoj.  Get outta here
---
Right, but I'd still prefer if there was a moderated classic warrior discord where one could find the same amount of info and helpful people, but without all the childish behavior.
---
And I do not have the faintest idea what you're even talking about when you're telling me to "own up to my shit play". Seems like a whole lot of people here are assuming a whole lot of things on who I am, what I do or why I'm looking for another warrior discord.
---
Earth Fury is [55%](https://ironforge.pro/servers?region=us&amp;filter=true) alliance, not 90%.
---
It's annoying for you, where it's impossible to play for Alliance
---
So you haven't actually been on one of those raids eh?  I've done it a few times, but the Zepplins have infinitely respawning lvl 60 guards that can see and shoot you through the zepplin walls.  Even 40 man raids get wiped out once the spawn happens.  There is nothing similar on any alliance flight paths.
---
I really hope us horde don’t kill the game in these two weeks of no BGs. Blizzard needs to push up the release date
---
I found 3 lotuses in less than 2 hours in Burning Steppes during Phase 2 once, which was pretty cool
---
Guess we have different values and principles. In my world, first of all you don't insult and disrespect people, even if you think they deserve it, because that doesn't solve anything. At worst, you just ignore them, you don't turn to baser instincts and use the situation to unload all of your pent up frustration.
---
Then, you've got to consider that the people coming to ask "stupid questions" might just be newbies who don't understand how class discords work, or even how asking for help works, and that you must do your own research beforehand. Yes, you heard me right, some people might not know this basic knowledge that you and me consider obvious. Or, they might be assholes intentionally trolling you or thinking that they're owed special treatment. Thing is, you can't know, and if you don't have the patience to treat those clueless people fairly and like the human beings that they are, you're the asshole, not them.
---
This kind of behaviour is simply unacceptable to me ... this is just not how you treat people.
---
it can't be both. it LITERALLY can't
---
GET EM SHERLOCK!
---
I think all too many people have that expectation. Where everything should be exactly how I remembered it 15 years ago, so why on earth would anything change?
---
And why should it change, when we're all 15 years older, more mature, are raising families of our own...why the hell would someone camp every strategic point in the game? Who even has time for that anymore?
---
But times have changed. I even daresay, the min-max culture of today, didn't exist the same way 15 years ago. Today we have every available resource about the game, which can be, and will be, looked upon. Entire gear lists with all stat priorities completely mapped out with all the support math to back it up, and even extensive leveling guides to reach 60 in the fastest possible manner. And I didn't even get into the gold-making guides yet.
---
You're complaining about Horde I see, well let me tell you about Alliance on my server. Not only are they camping Light's Hope Chapel 24/7 with minimum 2-3 people present at all times, but there's roving bands of 6+ Alliance steamrolling Horde along EPL, Azshara, and let's not even get started on Magic Tuesday when 3 full raids of Alliance are all ready guarding Blackrock Mountain.
---
Times have changed. There are more people on the servers today compared to 15 years ago. And the customer base, for good or bad, have absolutely changed. You would have thought that all of us younger and more spry 15 years ago would have been the gankers, but no.
---
No it's the Dads/Moms who have turned into them. Don't ask me how they make all that time for it, but here we are today.
---
No one is going to do that blizz needs to open up transfers to PVE servers if they want to save these subs
---
There's "letmecast", there's Leatrix which I believe does this as well.
---
Nothing other than the basic respect and decency of treating people like the human beings that they are.
---
Gnome over Dwarf for a single root break is ludicrous. Stoneform is way better.
---
Why does it feel like everyone on a PVP server telling people to stop whining is some horde that rolled horde knowing they’d outnumber alliance 4-1. That’s not PvP my man... you aren’t getting the PvP experience. Sorry.
---
&gt; Technically you should tho
---
yeah no
---
Yep. I was like 2 bars from 49. Tried two days in a row after honor dropped, about 3 hours each time. Was just constant deaths.
---
Cancelled my sub today. Was hoping they'd do something to address the issues they created, but nope. No fucks given.
---
It's really a shame. I was absolutely loving being back in "almost vanilla". I had missed this game.
---
You could spend 50 bucks on a computer on craigslist and be fine
---
WPL, and Winterspring.
---
Boi they have a 1 hr respawn time once picked
---
My guess is: it was sitting in a corpse that you failed to loot.
---
PvP servers and PvE servers were never linked in Vanilla. IF (and I stress: **IF**) they follow that rule (which there are arguments for, since it's akin to pitting high school football players against NFL players), PvE alliance numbers won't be allowed to make up for the massive lack of alliance on PvP realms. Sure, there are a couple Alliance heavy PvP realms, but not nearly enough to make it anywhere near 50/50. They would have to link every single realm together to get anywhere near fast enough queues, but that would really damage PvE realms attempting to be competitive.
---
you are the feeder team lmao
---
Earthfury is very balanced, but the alliance appears more organized
---
that's rude
---
Now I need to add here that my server seems balanced (kirtonos) and I have had little time to play since launch so the horror stories are just that for me. But go to the blizzard forums or keep reading here and it's clear that entire zones are locked off and while you may not see that as directly limiting play I am not interested in that type of game regardless of semantics. So if it ever hits the point that I can't enter certain zones without spending hours locked into spirit mode I will pass. PvP is fun, facing off against even 1 player who I can't hurt and has decided to camp me for the day isn't. And think of it this way, if 100 enemies each kill you once it's the same as 1 guy trying to go after you 100 times. Not all negative actions are malicious.
---
Don't forget about the extra rep buff from the darkmoon faire starting sunday.
---
I’m pretty sure the scopes for hit effect ranged attacks only.. so not as helpful if I’m thinking correctly
---
This is my first time through classic and I have to say the game is FANTASTIC however it does lack severely in end game content. Raids aren't fun, getting 40 people to work together and be on at the same time isn't fun. Feeling like your doing nothing because in reality your contribution is almost negligible in a group that big isn't fun. Knowing full well you could probably afk the raid and it wouldn't really make too much of a difference really depreciates the content. 
---
This isn't even with mentioning that with the debuff cap, poor end game itemization, and every end game raid boss till after bwl being immune to fire many specs are completely invalidated meaning you have to go whatever cookie cutter works. 
---
All end game in classic seems to be raids, even the phase content releases are just new raids no new dungeons. It's very unfortunate but the only thing I enjoy in this game is running dungeons and leveling to 60 and those things don't get you end game gear.
---
Wow more stupid straw man arguments.
---
I saw a video on the Korean system the other day.
---
They assign a banker for the run.
---
When an items drop they have a gold bid for the item, highest bidder gets the item and pays the gold to the banker. The entire run continues this way for every item. 
---
At the end of the run the gold paid to the banker is split evenly between the entire raid. 
---
If a big item drops everyone wins, and if you really want an item you can stockpile gold to get it. It's about the best system I've seen.
---
Sell
---
60 is 5.0%, 61 is 5.5%, and 62 is 6.0%.
---
To understand warmode and BFA, you need to know how wpvp progress in WoW. 
---
People like to tout Vanilla as a pinnacle of wpvp, but in actuality, it was largely a fluke. Quest designs were bad, and endgame content was near non-existent. So often the only thing to do was to engage in wpvp. 
---
BUT it wasn't a known game at the time. As in, the game had secrets and people still trying to figure shit out. People were not as organized as they are these days. Players are also better than they were in 2004. 
---
So wpvp happened, sure, but it wasn't as crazy as it is now because of all of the above. 
---
Then with TBC, Blizzard attempt to recreate wpvp. They weren't sure how to really get people interested in it since wpvp in Vanilla was largely spontaneous. wpvp objects were not added until later patches (Silithus as an example). 
---
So in TBC they had wpvp in the form of areas you would fight over for zone spanning buffs. 
---
The problem, as you already pointed out is this....
---
 &gt; People just play the game normally and ignore each other when they encounter each other anyways.
---
Which was largely my experience playing TBC. 
---
Those wpvp objectives were never really fought over much in TBC, at least not in big battles. 
---
Wrath tried to do the same thing, and again it didn't really work. The large PVP zone was a great idea, but it eventually was "cracked" and strategies formed. You just essentially zerg a particular side and win rather easily.
---
I didn't really play Cata so I don't know what they added there. I think more of the same. 
---
MOP had an entire leveling zone dedicated to pvp and then the timeless isle was essentially a pvp island and designed to be that way. There you had endgame content with pvp as an invitation. 
---
WoD was similar. Ashran was itself a pvp zone but add a tug of war battle sort of like how I think the developers imagined AV should have been. 
---
Legion did not really encourage wpvp as much because we were technically "working together" but it had its moments. 
---
Any way, long story short, BFA is a faction brawl, and Warmode helps set that up. 
---
It allows players who want to pvp, to be able to be flagged for pvp. Doing so gives them a strong incentive and it isn't something they can toggle easily since you have to be at your capital city to turn it off. 
---
But you are right, even still players felt like it was unfair. Many alliance players complained that they would always be out numbered and so could not utilize the benefits of the mode compared to horde players. 
---
Faction imbalance plays a roll to that, certainly. But player behavior does as well. 
---
Horde players are probably more likely to engage in pvp action than alliance players are. 
---
There's also psychological effects going on as well. The perception of you or your team constantly losing will demoralize players. 
---
OP posted a graph that shows 1.5 to 1 a week or two ago. That's not ***that*** bad, but then jumps the gap by double amounts. Because those players decided to call it quits (potentially) rather than fight and possibly win.
---
Not every single pvp server is horde favored.
---
You rolled PVP, it’s your own fault, if you had enough brain cells you would have seen this coming and rolled PVE.
---
what does 70 charges means? instant poison 3 says 70 charges with no additional context
---
Yeah, totally balanced. Just 60/40 in total high level characters and closer to 65/35 online recently. 
---
Peeerfectly balanced. Lmao.
---
Are you playing with max settings though? Or are those raid fps? At launch i had to play on my laptop which is a i7 2.20ghz and a downclocked half burned gt540m 2gb vram 8ghz ddr on classic graphics I think i had more fps than that
---
A yesss the salt feed me
---
If a gnome rogue camps you for an hour or so, assume it's me.
---
i was killed lvl 60 warrios at lvl 57. but this mean nothing just becuase only noobs gank lowbies.
---
You dont need it at all, you have plenty of time even without pathfinding.
---
With the release of bwl and aq40 your value will increase exponentially. Off tanking is super boring in mc, but bwl will give you a bit more to do and then you'll definitely have the opportunity to do some main tanking with zg
---
Exactly. 
---
"My children can't eat!"
---
"Well, occasionally my children struggle to get fed as well. Have you tried firing the cook and the maid, and hiring someone new?"
---
The next problem is the pve servers will get super full
---
Yeah those guys are dicks. They are using you to draw higher level players to the area. You get in guild chat etc...
---
But the point is they won't be there when BGs launch.
---
thank you!
---
I got downvoted for saying the same thing. People think these sites are getting their numbers directly from the server or something. Once this sub has found its latest narrative, it clings to that for dear life. Layering, early DM, Spy, alliance doomsday prophets... there's a new threat to Classic every week, and right now it's "horde players are literally destroying the game."
---
It was pretty much maxed out.
---
I'm.just trying to show the example that 8 year old hardware plays this ok. Any modern computer with a low end video card will reach 60fps
---
That can’t be right because 1% crit = ~12 SP not 18. also it depends on your gear( there is no single easy conversion)
---
That's not "korean system", that's a common Gbid system used in pugs.
---
Here is the blue post proving you wrong
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/news=298695/blizzard-investigating-honor-calculation-bugs?webhook
---
Confirmed visual bug.
---
Your comment is really stupid. No one is missing out on 20-70k+ honor because of "farming lowbies over and over". That literally makes no sense from both a qualitative and quantitative perspective. Like what?
---
Na, resets are on wednesdays on EU servers so he most likely means tues/wednesdays, but also plays on a EU server.
---
I'd recommend healcommclassic or raid frames that have healcomm integrated.  If you and all your fellow healers have it installed in raid, it gives predictive healing on targets so you guys don't healsnipe/overheal.
---
&gt;Try to remember warriors will break fear quickly, so you gotta be ready to stop cast and re apply.
---
sacrifice voidwalker and they can't get agro by hitting the shield. 2 shadowbolt and they dead. warlocks just a legal expolit in pvp.
---
There is always AV
---
Train everything except polearms and fist weapons
---
Absolutely. Get the neck for later on, but replace once you pick up the vectus neck for the time being
---
Im awhile from raids but have heard the same from acouple other priests along with what everyone else is reccomending
---
Raiding MC requires little to no effort and is boring for most classes tbh
---
Private servers have to compete with other servers for players. Blizzard doesn't have to worry about shit because they know you're going to keep playing.
---
I felt like early 50s was a slog, but once I got into BRD and LBRS quest groups, the exp was actually pretty damn good.
---
Come a year from now, that's a problem we all wish we had.
---
At least they sweat and panicked for a while. Was good while it lasted.
---
The only thing that is stupid are the ppl that gank lowbies trying to level repeatedly in large groups for 5 honor a piece.
---
&gt;Because in general all the min/max'ers who came from private servers etc rolled horde because of racials.
---
Do you mean went Alliance?
---
State of the sub is in shambles, wtf is the point of this post? A guy loses a group member? How is this funny or worthwhile to discuss?
---
lol
---
Pls tell me ur joking bby
---
Till you’re caught by an epic mount
---
I think layering is helpful only because real vanilla servers had like 3k capacity. If these are 10k capacity there's definitely not enough farmable resources for shit to be affordable unless you enjoy grinding gold on your warlock/hunter/alt in dungeons. Other than that the game has heavily become horde dominated over the past 5 or so years on retail which has spilled onto classic.
---
Where did you get 90% from lol
---
Ah yes, that totally slipped my mind ty. The other points remain
---
It's largely gear dependent, but 1% hit is much closer to ~10 in pre bis. Also, at this phase of the game, crit is much more important than hit for locks.
---
All of them get ported back to the city after each battleground.
---
&gt;And they will dislike and try to turn this around in comments here. Because they try to manipulate.
---
Always nice when someone dismisses negative feedback before they've even read it. That said horde players and alliance players all say the same thing about each other. The people in the playerbase aren't any different. Actually there is a lot of overlap because players can play both factions. 
---
To your main point, no layering won't be good for world PvP. You'd still have the same problems except on multiple layers. It's not like layering can fix server populations and it causes the in game economy a lot of problems on it's own. Layers also break up immersion and communities so just no.
---
The people who are quitting even though they rolled on a PvP server initially really confuse me.
---
What? We ran 40 man raids pre-honor and had fun, honor is just the icing for us. Even now we kill people over 10 times, which gives us no honor at all.
---
My Druid is dinged Lv52 today with 32 days played.  Still doubt I'm the slowest though.  There's tons of stuff to do.

---
Im at 59. Idk if I've quit yet or not.
---
no offense but play on a pve server? what were you expecting? 
---
blizzard made a mistake not locking or transfer locking sides.
---
I've quit until I can transfer to a pve server. I've been too lucky with too many drops to try it again.
---
What is more rare, holy priest or warlock?
---
because it’s funny you killjoy
---
And hinterlands
---
And a nice long questie log to complement the pvp raid
---
I don't think you are seeing it from the Paladin perspective.
---
You say this like Fear Ward doesn't exist
---
almost prime copy pasta material....almost.

Pool rage shortly before he does his knockback, otherwise cycle taunt-mocking-taunt-challenging shout-taunt

Yup, its a completely different world for the sub 60 bracket of players. Before phase 2 I could get a level every 2-3 days wih my wife without using a leveling guide which felt like a pretty good pace for us. I can't get her to log in anymore because anywhere we go to level we get dumpstered by horde and spend more time dead than alive. We started phase 2 at lvl 52, after a 2 separate 30 minute corpse walks for a full rested BRD run we are 54. Doubt we are going to make it to 60 at this rate tbh.
---
But to keep up with the popular mantra of the sub reddit
---
lel pvp happened on a pvp server git gud scrub
---
Yep. I play on Mograine, and back when Classic was fresh (and the census addon hadn't broken yet), a lot of people uploaded their data from both factions. The results showed pretty much exactly 50/50. Then the addon broke for a while and most people stopped uploading data, even after it was fixed again. Now the sites show 70/30 or something because there's only a few people still uploading, and most of them happen to be horde; but there has been literally no change in in-game realities. It's still an extremely even server, alliance has a very strong presence in WPvP and always control plenty of zones, get world bosses, etc. Still, because the sites show their skewed numbers, people have begun crying about how unbalanced this server has become. It's like some vague numbers on a random website count for more than what they actually see in the game. 
---
This sub is always looking for the latest thing that they can whine hysterically about. Sure, some servers truly are fucked, but definitely not all of them. Playing on one of the most balanced PvP servers and still seeing idiots claim that it's hopelessly unbalanced makes me suspect that most people are just full of shit. Everything gets blown way out of proportion and people willingly fall for confirmation bias because they want to identify a reason that they're not satisfied with the game. Most of the time, they simply make shit up.
---
Last night I was in an 8-man PvP squad. We went to Feralas, but 15+ alliance was sweeping across the zone killing everything. So we went to Burning Steppes where like 20 alliance was dominating the zone. We flew to EPL and died as soon as we landed because the place was completely dominated by alliance. We ended up going to Felwood because we couldn't really find another place where it was possible for an 8-man group to survive. The day before that, alliance got Kazzak because they showed up with three raids to our two. Two days before that, alliance took Azuregos under the same circumstances. And still you get people claiming the server is fucked for alliance.
---
Someone get a message to them:  Chat is being batched, that's all it is.
---
Take your damn upvote.
---
Already level 3 I cant go back now
---
when they all quit it means we've won the war
---
Guess I'm remembering the event incorrectly.  Thought both factions needed to  complete their half of the war effect to open the gates.
---
Strongly agree with this assessment. In Vanilla Holy Paladins are just extremely strong in *coordinated* PvP, as they are the only Healer that can survive under significant focus fire. Priest and Shaman, for instance, don't yet have their survivability spells they'll get later in the game's existence; things like Pain Suppression and Earth Shield which significantly increase their ability to survive a stun+multi DPS combo. Paladins are really, really strong in highly organized pvp in the game's early lifespan.
---
But that won't matter much once Horde also have Paladins, at which point the racials become the preeminent consideration, and Horde definitely have better racials. Right now, you can make an argument that Horde Racials &gt; Alli Racials but Paladins&gt;Shamans for highly organized PvP, but in TBC it's just Horde advantage all the way down.
---
herod is like 61:39 bud, check those numbers again lmao
---
This only would have worked during the early creation. Or put up a similar disclaimer warning players stacking one faction
---
Yea well druids are inferior in some ways. Mind blown.
---
Got sword from dwarf elites from second kill
---
Commenting to save for later thanks
---
This is why my guild refuses to do raid 2.
---
Yet, I can out threat your noob ass any day.  Probably take less damage to boot.  Why dont you go spec fury prot, and die some more like an idiot.
---
min max pvp'er are alliance, because alliance is vastly superior in premade battlegrounds thx to paladin
---
I'd say that you should report them (definitely won't hurt) but if it is the rooftop I'm thinking of in Darkshire, it's 100% possible to get onto that rooftop without using any terrain glitches. There's a hill close enough and high enough that if you have an epic mount you can jump from the hilltop to the rooftop.
---
So no source?
---
[53.8% Horde, 46.2% Alliance raiding population that uploads to Warcraftlogs](https://ironforge.pro/servers/?region=us&amp;filter=true). Probably a pretty good indicator and really not a horrible imbalance. It is possible Alliance players are more likely to raidlog and not play at other times because of a larger perceived imbalance. 
---
Horde definitely dominates the vast majority of servers, and I'm sure playing as Alliance can certainly be pretty miserable. That said, I've definitely seen players from even or Alliance-favored servers (Grobbulus and Earthfury specifically, lately) complaining about being massively outnumbered.
---
Just let us have a laugh at the meme for fuck sake, we understand shit is imbalanced you don’t need to bring it up everywhere all the time, just enjoy the humor for a moment
---
Must be horde
---
I have a 60 alliance and horde and both sides get dicked
---
RAnDOm lOot hAPpeNEd In a randOM LooT gamE
---
I’m sorry it took so long to get to your dungeon, we know there are critical issues with balance. This is majorly blizzards fault with the transfers, but there are also big behavioral problems as well. Now shut up and laugh at the funny.
---
so basically, you're on the internet, as a grown man, bitching and moaning about a game you barely play anymore because of a bad decision you made on your own. that's impressive.
---
i really don't care too much about classic. i'm only here because my friends are here. we'll all probably move on to better shit if/when this game dies. 
---
paid server xfers are an assumption at best at this point and i can almost guarantee bg's won't alleviate the wpvp being a complete shitshow for alliance.
---
do everyone a favor, including yourself, and just unsub now. maybe blizzard will admit they have a problem and do something about once all the whiny bitches leave.
---
Quit, there is no way in hell I am going to be able to convince my wife to start all over on a PvE server without the option of faction transfer and there is no convincing her right now to play because we spend more time dead than alive as lvl 54's.
---
Just a classic case of the "there are 20 other games I could be playing from my backlog that are far more enjoyable than RP'ing as some NPC that drops honor for the local pack of sweaty 60's."
---
Of course I know it's not their job. They still owe people basic respect and decency though. And even if you argue that some people over there really don't deserve any respect or decency because they're not showing any themselves, it should end with a mute/ban or a "go read faq" answer, which would be the adult way of handling things, instead of calling people names, unloading all your frustration on them and ganging up on people like some sort of schoolyard show of dominance.
---
Not to mention that this kind of bullshit behaviour is not reserved for stupid questions and the such but also people who ask legit questions but simply don't understand the explanation as quickly as the people giving it would want.
---
/gquit
---
I have a bunch of high level toons on a PVP server. I'm new to wow and didn't know it would be this shit come P2. As soon as I wasn't enjoying it, I started a warrior on a RP server. Never looked back, no more issues. 
---
Just make a new toon on a PVE. Your old toon will still be there if you decide to go back.
---
You're the one saying "I can't ...." I don't even play a warrior, bro. You're so triggered. Lmfao.
---
Not from my experience
---
you can spam instant attacks that do not have a cooldown  to quickly level up a weapon skill. for example, a hunter's wing clip (a slowing ability) can quickly be spammed to level up a new weapon's skill in a fight.
---
Add a 2 minute debuff after a death, taking you temporarily out of pvp, needs to be added to reduce this imbalanced griefing bullshit camping end game instances. Debuff goes away if you attack before 2 mins runs out. Its fair, reduces the amount of griefing if people are passing through trying to get to instances.
---
&gt; because they prefer their lore, asthetic, etc.  
---
You misspelled hardiness and will of the forsaken
---
You literally absolutely wrong.
---
For real. I left WoW when I went to college in 2009 and only came back for classic.
---
Folks like the above just don't believe that this isn't the game I used to play and enjoy, I guess.
---
IF isn't for honor farming? Allies can stay unflagged so no way to guarantee honor like fighting on contested zones.
---
That's where you're wrong, my dude. While i play a lock now, I played a paladin for thousands of hours. Since I'm not an entitled cry baby, I was always fully understanding when a mageblade was prio'd to DPS. Knowing it was infinitely better in their hands and I'd get mine one day anyway.
---
If your definition of being a great reader is reading something that isn’t written but portly implied, Then I guess I’m not a great reader.
---
If that’s your counterargument that I’m not a great reader. I counter your argument by stating that your not a great writer. As a great writer would of wrote in a way to be understood without misunderstanding. 
---
He said this isn’t like 2008-2010 which was wrath. I stated that of course not. Wrath didn’t have world Pvp like classic, you can’t compare a game with 4 years of changes and assume that a game that is entirely different would be the same as wrath.
---
If you can’t fail to understand that your just not a great reader.
---
See how stupid that sounds?
---
This is becoming a meme. Are you just citing the meme?
---
Jokes on you, my main has been a rogue for most of my wow career and I'm playing rogue in classic.  My point was that most dont know that it was nerfed.  Even if you did know, well you're not most of the playerbase.
---
I’m trying to learn the solo ZF graveyard farm but it’s frustrating
---
They will still be there.
---
Or if they truly are just trying to goad  high levels into fighting them, they will just be replaced by someone else that truly wants to ruin the fun of others because they find enjoyment in it.
---
The people are this way because they are. People like to blame a broken system but it's the people doing it, not the system itself.
---
LIT EMOJIS 😂😂😂
---
this, i read that on wowhead. went in, done on first book
---
Why shouldn't we, its a fucking shit show. Blizzard fucking ruined this game by having increased pop caps the way they did.
---
Horde can be literally everywhere 100 strong, 24/7
---
I don't care where you go, they're camping the flight point and the entire path to a dungeon or raid entrance.
---
I literally thought the worst neckbearding i've ever seen was in official Ark: Survival Evolved servers, but they have literally nothing on the Horde in classic wow. 17 of them will camp some random ass flight point like Tanaris, on the offchance someone 50+ lands so they can spawn camp them 500 times for 0 honor.
---
Personally I'm of the mindset that if there is a location that players can reach without using terrain glitches that guards are unable to reach there is no reason for the player to be punished for oversight on the devs' behalf. I certainly support reporting it, I just don't think that players should be penalized for locating an area in which guards don't attack them (as long as wall jumping or other terrain glitches were not used to get to said location).
---
Source? Last census I checked showed 7k concurrent max, and the game devs said 4.5k was max in 2006 due to hardware restrictions.
---
only thing you're confirming is there's not enough alliance on your server to keep horde there entertained so there's no point in camping it
---
Most ppl though it was going to be like actual classic WPVP unless you played on a private server you probably didn't realize that having 10x the pop was going to completely change what the game is to the point where even calling it classic is a joke
---
Well i have take a night being camped by alliance in booty bay while fishing, its same for everyone ( Except booty bay gard may need a fix .. ? )   
---
I mean they where 3 and wil just vanish / Fear the guard after kiling someone, jump to the water, and it will end here
---
I have a naive goal to push blizzard to release their "servers" like minecraft servers or many other games.  Let players officially start a server with your published materials and mod it how they like.  There are games that have official gameplay servers and they are doing great, but they also have a smaller community of "modders" and people who just like to play mods.  If you do it right, you aren't losing much, and probably gaining from it.  People will buy a legit copy of WotLK to play a cool modded version like the random skill thing or something as opposed to going to the pserver site and downloading the client that's compatible.  And you can certainly "host" the servers for mods as well and charge the owners to launch them and run them.  People will sign up to be a GM on a server for free just because they love the game and have the time to put in to managing a server.
---
I know blizzard has come a long way since the original WoW servers that were physical servers.  They shouldn't be far from having a container someone can mod and deploy to their hardware.  It's a lot more resource intensive to run a WoW server than minecraft so maybe put a minimum player count and have signups or whatever.  People love FRESH servers.  They need to embrace modding, there are so many iterations of this game.  It's really pretentious to assume the latest thing you've done is the best thing for everyone who has ever bought your product.
---
You're posting cringe bro
---
Most servers were always going to be imbalanced one way or the other, especially if blizz is willing to put in free transfers with no limitations.
---
Nope, Herod. I keep finding them everywhere now that I know what I’m looking for
---
14 times is an understatement.  On Whitemane, they literally will camp the ENTIRE Path from Thorium down.  If you try to go from Burning Steppes, as soon as you get near the ramps, there's another 15-30 camping that entire pathway.
---
Ah yes, I misunderstood what you were saying my bad
---
Hard to make generalisations like that, you may be right about the average player but there is definitely a large sub-set of players who have an ideology in line with yours, you just have to look for it..
---
Or have my luck - I stumbled into a guild that sits at exactly my mentality. I rock up to raids prepared, consums and if possible world buffs. Not because its needed but instead because it makes raids quicker, and after your 4th or 5th MC clear - the difference between a 2h and 4h clear is huge. Everyone is chilled as fuck and we have had zero dramas in the guild whatsoever!
---
With this guild I don't really have to mix with the general pop of players too much, because we have 2 full raid teams of 60's and people looking for groups all the time. Everyone brings each other up in regards to damage - its beautiful.
---
I see him in world/trade sometimes and had no idea he was the original one, I thought it was just someone who copied the meme and ran with it.
---
Actually it highly depends on the scenario, because it definately is about the mage outlasting the warrior in a duel. Not group pvp though.
---
I am leveling a mage to get me gold and grind more things. Looking at this I wonder if I should level a priest or a pally. Leaning more towards a pally now.
---
Casual Encounters? Good luck to you guys if so!
---
I only play during raid times now.  Taking two hours to get inside BRM is pathetic.
---
I'm have a feeling OP is in a Westfall-Alliance guild too
---
When I originally played vanilla, I would ad for groups by saying LFM, even though I was by myself. Usually you would get 1 or 2 real quick and you had your start.
---
Over the duration of the poison, it can proc a maximum of 70 times. Each time it procs, a charge is used.
---
GUID?
---
Dude its pretty well known at this point, for example a bunch of gear has 1.12 itemization which was not the case prior. A lot of garbage gear got reworked, good gear got added in over time etc. On top of that a lot of Classes got reworked towards the end to at least be semi-viable - IIRC Druids are one of those classes. 
---
I'm still loving Classic but it is without a doubt a watered down version of Vanilla - and thats probably a good thing.
---
No it's not. Its the most efficient.
---
Carebear over here
---
Sounds like a Calamity befell them.
---
Killing lowbies gets them to log in to their mains or go ask some 60s to come down there to try to get revenge though.
---
Ironforge says 58/42 in favor of horde for my server, wow classic population says 58/42 in favor of alliance. It’s obvious that at least one of those is completely wrong
---
Run into the secret East entrance north of town. Req key. Then die inside and corpse run back to whichever dm you prefer.
---
You're missing the one major factor; server capacity.  There are up to FOUR TIMES as many people per server and no battlegrounds to filter them out of the world designed for that significantly smaller population balance.
---
That ALREADY is a gigantic change.
---
Imagine that every day, 5 people a day walk up to you and ask you how to tie a shoe. Adults, not children. Day in, day out.
---
It's a question so si.ple, any adult can google it. You find no disrespect in the fact they are wasting your time without putting a scrap of effort into looking for something themselves?
---
You cannot expect me to believe that in the age of information people dont know how to look up basic questions? And yea, we have different morals. I dislike stupidity. That qualifies as stupidity. 
---
I dont care to know what their reasoning for asking such questions is. Simple fact is asking a dumb question with hundreds of Google ready answers is stupid.
---
Go ahead. Say I am an a** hole. Doesnt bother me. But hey, I'm just an adult that isnt bothered if someone is mean to me on the internetz. If I ever ask a stupid question,  I expect the same answers and sass I give to others.
---
Come to westfall alliance, it's a very very good server.
---
Blink sheep lol
---
It was 2.5k, not 4.5k.  Even at your proposed number, that's almost double the population at a minimum.
---
1 dps is a lot when your absolute best players maybe deal 300 dps.
---
Nope only finds people that do something
---
Fine by me, if that's what they've decided, seems reasonable enough. Simply expressing my outlook on the topic.
---
I've been treating raid as a weekly gear opportunity and enjoying dungeons and some pvp as the main content, im sure raiding will be more fun in p3 with BWL being more variety and more challenging than MC/ONY
---
Jokes on them, I’m paying $15 a month for retail. Wait....
---
Good post
---
I initially rolled alliance back in high school, saw a huge tauren warrior and rerolled immediately because of the awesome impression it left on me.
---
It's not unsubbing because of the "PvP system".  It's due to the GIGANTIC population difference from the original Vanilla to what Classic is now with up to four times the increase.  Without battlegrounds, it's a gigantic deathball everywhere you go.  Anyone 48+ it just being slaughtered, much less the population imbalances on servers causing an even larger disparity.
---
Same here man. Dwarf hunter on Thunderfury. As soon as I hit 50 or so it’s been impossible to do anything outside of dungeon grinding. I can occasionally get some questing done in the early morning hours, but it’s few and far between. This sucks and I’m sick of Sunken Temple. I’m gonna chill on Pagle until BGs come out. I wanted PVP but this stuff is somewhere between griefing and farming. I get why it happens, and I get that the honor system sucks, but this just isn’t fun. I’m not spending my very limited free time corpse running.
---
We have the exact situation except reversed on my server. alliance has only a slight advantage population wise but they are just straight up better at grouping and camping than horde is (I say this as a horde player). I don’t sympathize for the fellow hordies on my server who complain because it’s only lack of skill and grouping ability and not really an imbalance that causes problems.
---
People can level in AV from 51-60 though so the amount of people in the world will go down
---
People playing with DKP in 2019 are morons.
---
Every problem I ever had with a guild in over five years of MMO gaming came from loot councils and bad officers.
---
Value is subjective.  DKP is not.
---
It must be If they keep doing it, but is it really  better than finding 1v1s in the world? I guess I should try it as a rogue
---
If you're already 60, that's cool.  But for the rest of us stuck in the 48-59 range are fucked.  It's unplayable everywhere.
---
Well that’s pathetic
---
Because a bunch of grown men probably 30 years old still have the maturity of a 14 year old in this sub
---
Phase 2 made the game unplayable on PvP servers.  No battlegrounds means everywhere you go, there are roaming deathbands looking to slaughter you over and over.  Those of us stuck in the 48-59 range are just being obliterated and can't progress.  This is NOT what vanilla used to be.
---
Says who? All they do is literally stream video games how does that affect you?
---
ehh!
---
It's not forbidden to go on rooftops. It's forbidden to hit people from there in a matter that the guards can't do their job.
---
Look up zephams warlock sim. It's a Google sheet that sums out every aspect of classic warlock, including options for your spec, buffs, and gear. It shows every item and what DPS value it brings as well given the buffs, raid comp, spec, etc.
---
I'll edit this and link later once I'm not on mobile.
---
I'm not gonna lie. The fucking formatting in this post is making my eyes bleed.
---
I leveled 48-60 on herod as horde during the honor hit and it was terrible. The echo chamber here making it seem like Horde have this great path to level is ignorance at its best. WPL was unplayable. Alliance camped the entrence from WPL to TG constantly. EPL is just as bad with roaming death squads but certainly not as bad as WPL.
---
I didn't play for two days because I would get FP camped in every lowbie zone by Alliance. I spent two hours trying to find a spot and decided to just not login.
---
It's all fun and games, dude
---
And yet, I'm no there crying about picking a wrong server 15 years later.
---
Im a hunter here and would never roll for HoJ, just if I didnt already have my 2 pre-bis and there was no other melee class that needed it.
---
Any hunter Rolling(with others needing it) for HoJ is a Huntard
---
Yeah, on my rogue I spent about 25 mins on that quest. Later doing it on my hunter, imagining it would so much easier to grind them I get it on my first yeti. Wasted RNG -.-
---
Or it can be like the Horde/Alliance mythic raiding guild ratio on retail and just completely kill off one faction. ;)
---
leatrix plus
---
Some pieces of valor are prebis for fury prot only like 2/3
---
I just need to make my flarecore stuff for fire resist then I’ll probably drop tailoring. Thanks for the help
---
Fight club discord.
---
what if the guild lets pugs roll on loot? then the hunter might litterally never get the leaf?
---
/golfclap
---
yes, easily.  Against a 63 boss, you need 9% hit at 300 wpn skill, and 6% hit at 305 skill.  The 305 skill isn't particularly useful though, because you will find that your best shit already has a ton of hit on it.
---
I hated/hate people who tell this lie. Some people have time constraints and can't wait for a whole group to form.
---
Why would you all invest so much in a pvp server if you didn't want the gankfest? I made that mistake with my first vanilla toon and then never again. Were you not aware of how bad it would get?
---
Yeah, that’s not how it works. We KOS anyone of the opposite faction, period.
---
But didnt we want classic? The server imbalance issues I can understand since it is way more players crammed into a realm. But are we really complaining about balance? Not saying you are specifically, but I'm seeing a lot of others. You make a great point in theory, I'm in heartseeker and I can tell you there are a huge amount of locks on the alliance side.
---
I transfered from a "Full" pvp server full of tryhards to the smallest pvp server of my region and it's the best thing ever. I get to play on a faction balanced pvp server without the sea of pvp grinding tryhards the most populated server have.
---
A couple hundred gold? Screw that! There’s 20 warriors trying to get caster dps at any time on our server for these runs, strat ud runs, and jump runs. It’s impossible.
---
I'm trying to convince my guild to re-roll PvE, but that's a tough sell when we'd lose at least two months of raid progress.
---
Makes me want to roll alliance....
---
Just kidding they all have bitch tits
---
Yea we have two guildies that have almost every enchant in the game right now. I’m gonna drop it for herb or mining and then drop tailoring once I make my flarecore stuff and get engineering
---
This fuckwad said he didn’t really need it until it dropped. I didn’t explicitly reserve it or master loot when he said that. Learned my lesson I guess.
---
[Oof](https://i.imgur.com/h8r0F.jpg)
---
Jadefire run in felwood.   Die like a bitch, and everything they drop is $$$$$$.
---
Not sure why it feels like that. I went alliance.
---
&gt;Yeah I unsubbed last night
---
Funny thing is this actually solves the issues, the game has too many players the servers are too crowded. Blizzard didn't expect this many people to stay subbed this long.
---
Salt mine discovered
---
This is bullshit and makes no sense.
---
Honour spy is clientside, there's no honour api, it's not communicating with the server, it's just reading your fucking combat log.
---
Think before you speak. You have NO CLUE what you're talking about.
---
Did you read past the first sentence of the title?
---
I love it. This is an excellent method of honor trading
---
Just going to quit. I'm already raid logging despite being horde on a somewhat horde dominated server. It's just not fun.
---
Casually level a PvE character until server transfers come out... if at all.
---
If BGs don't make things better AND Blizzard doesn't offer paid server transfers from PvP-&gt;PvE? Spend more of my time on other games and catching up on books I want to read.
---
Thanks! How many runs did it take ya?
---
In a hardcore guild you don't have to tell people to get their BiS gear and consumables.
---
In a hardcore guild people get all those things and every single world buff because they want to.
---
tbh they probably want classic to fail looool
---
Yea it was 45/55 before the Alliance left, because the Horde outnumbered them 100:1.
---
Uhh my point is BGs are cross realm, not single realm like the above poster implies. Should be pretty easy to comprehend it was a 1 sentence post with 5 words lol.
---
He has none, it's bullshit. It's clientside so it's impossible to lag the server.
---
It's comparable to claiming that people with fancy scrolling combat text add-ons lag the server.
---
Is Robe of the Void worth farming at all on a pvp server?
---
Your attitude sucks
---
I think he did but you failed to see the connection.
---
as far as I know you can queue with w/e number you want.
---
There's this sweet option to turn off error speech.
---
That's a blatant lie. You clearly don't watch him, he doesn't hunt or kill Asmon nearly as much on stream as edited youtube videos. I do watch Advertise as frequently as I can. He hardly focuses on killing Asmon in game, and he's not sniped once since I've watched. Source: You can check my follow time next time we're in Advertise's stream together.
---
it didn’t work for us. I fucked up on my logging as I just started doing it, and didn’t have advanced combat log turned on. 
---
we’re doing it on tuesday with group 1 so I’ll try it again and hopefully log correctly.
---
I dunno if they'd *need* more monetization, but they'll definitely *want* more monetization, and stupidly expensive server transfers are a great way to milk cash from a problem they caused.
---
Pugs deserve to roll on items that are not reserved.
---
"my experience was terrible"
---
yeah and you have no idea *how much worse* it was for alliance do you?
---
No Walmarts in Europe? Is that real? But yea you're probably right. 
---
Sad to see everyone missed my sarcasm because I didn't /s though. Lol.
---
Oh shut the fuck up. Blizzard never said that these servers were so lopsided. Just stop it.
---
Plenty of people do daily, they just don't realise it until they experience open world ganking
---
&gt; all you can do
---
Oh yea, "attack player" is a Horde only racial.
---
I haven't really followed this thing that closely but even a little has been enough to keep me hesitant to make time to play again until I know I won't be wasting it. If this is the case then I don't know what can be done to solve this though forced faction changes is not the way no matter what. The sad truth is that people are so fucking ignorant that they will let the game die instead of be mature and take free faction changes, which it will if this affects sub numbers so soon after launch. 
---
Blizzard needs to stop with transfers completely and simply send all of the overpopulated faction's players an in-game piece of mail explaining that they are offering faction swaps at no cost, X many to find some sense of balance, and then see if anyone goes to their account settings and takes it. And maybe the only way to make this work is set a number of let's say 1000 for this example and the swaps will only happen when the list is full. People may be hesitant to swap sides knowing they will receive what everyone is bitching about, but may also be willing to make the change if they know the balance will immediately shift and that they won't have to worry about it. This may be especially effective if they advertise that it will help make BG queues shorter as that could be very enticing to the people who love PvP and already see the problem overpopulation is going to be in a couple of weeks.

Fighting back is pathetic? Truly, carebears.
---
But oh so satisfying when you manage to stance dance smoothly
---
The roof camping is legit against the rules though. If GMs do their job they will tell you to get off it.
---
Can i get a PM with the discord invite link please?
---
Wait, is the WoR threat wipe not actually intended behavior?
---
Same, but my plan is to visit MC/Ony once a week aswell.
---
It walks around town repeating this but they don't say in chat that they are selling it just for people to pay attention to the guild name.
---
Jup even on low/medium pop tbc privateservers with only slight imbalances the alliance suffered hard.
---
For anyone wondering why: imagine every player needs 12-36 essences of water for their bis gear (not preraid bis, actual bis)  but there are only 3 spots to farm them, all in the open world.
---
so should guild leader atleast make an effort to get hunters that already have it? or just reserve it? or is that just what the hunter has to live with and this is all just "part of the game"
---
I play Paladin in a DKP guild (I hate DKP) and I will absolutely get the Mageblade soon.
---
I think it's absolutely stupid that I will get it, but I will get it because DKP system ululul.
---
So I am absolutely with you.
---
FYI for others this has already been confirmed many times in Fight Club discord. we tried this on Rag last week and confirmed the same three melee DPS (that we confirmed via GUID) were getting knock back every single time. The way this works is confirmed. I would suggest if you are having a hard time with this fight to have the bottom 5 guid melee DPS stack fire res and fire protection options and mark them so your healers know who to grab.
---
This meme made the hitmarker sound in my mind
---
WoD was good expansion if you were raid logger/pvp player. Good class/raid design and pvp gear that scaled up in pvp instances. It's just that other than those things, there really wasn't much to do. But what was there was very good.
---
That's so awesome
---
I, too, require my friends to throw away hundreds of hours of their time on my behalf.
---
Oof. Guild runs or caster groups are your friend if you go for it again. Good luck!
---
The overlap between people who care about raiding and people who care about pvp is nearly 100%, especially right now since the *only* source of good pvp gear is from raiding.  Maybe in a few months when epic pvp gear starts to show up with some regularity you’ll see some divergence, but even then, the raid gear is so much easier to get.  
---
The census sites are garbage and have been since the mods were broken the first time.  I don’t know if everyone just abandoned it or what happened exactly, but I’ve seen so many examples of complete shit data from them to have full confidence that they’re inaccurate.  I’ve seen links showing my server (Herod US) as nearly 50/50, and that’s just laughable.
---

Farm the money in dme and Mara

---
How am I lying if I say "LFM" = Looking for More? 🤔 
---
And also rarely you have to wait more than 10 minutes to get a full group if your not on a dead server or playing wierd hours. 
---
If your not happy, you can just leave the group and other 4 guys who has The time to form a group and clear the dungeon deserves the spot more than you.
---
If im solo in group i always start with "LFM to XX dungeon" then when i get first 2 guys, I usually know what is needed LF2M healer + dps or LF1M tank.
---
I run the game on three different computers depending on who's using what around the house.
---
I7 4970k and GTX 1070 - Max settings and 144 FPS at almost all time. Game slows down 10 FPS for every 30 players or so in the screen. Really plays great.
---
I7 2600s and GTX 660 ti - Settings at 8/10 and still get 60 FPS. Plays the game well.
---
I7 8000 something laptop with intel 620 integrated graphics - sucks. 60 FPS in the open world but was getting 20-40 FPS in Dire Maul with settings at 2/10.
---
So you just can't buy junk and expect the game to run well at max settings. You need something at least decent.
---
With your budget and good sales on now you could probably find an AMD 2700x/1660 to combo that would play the game amazingly well.
---
I saw this earlier tonight. Me and my guildies followed it around reporting
---
How long do you usually wait to scrub your post history?
---
Couldn't agree more. People would be highly highly upset at allowing transfers off the servers, but as it stands now those PvP servers are just dying a slow inevitable death, better to piss some people off now than lose close to 50% of your playerbase. I could be wrong but I feel like unless Blizzard takes a radical action soon, almost every alliance player who isn't willing to reroll and start all over again is going to unsub and quit in the next 2-3 months. The game just isn't playable in it's current state.
---
sitting in an evade spot with a hunter is being a carebare lol... atleast get down there and fight the lowbies hand to hand
---
The ID number associated with your characters as you create them. Characters created earlier have lower GUIDs and rag bases his attacks on ascending GUID's. Therefore he will always attack the target the lowest GUIDs with that.
---
Creates a situation where tanks created before other tanks have a theoretical bonus over their younger counterparts.
---
I think all private servers had honor with battlegrounds. Either from launch or added together later.
---
The most comparable situation was on K3 when horde had 15-60 minute queues but everyone could queue for bgs from anywhere and reappear in their previous spot after the bg. I think everyone who played on K3 knew how bad classic phase 2 was going to be.
---
They specifically said it depends on how many people play Classic. The drop off since release has been pretty significant and according to the census sites, our server lost 10% just since phase two. Most servers have lost about 25% since release. 
---
Do you think pvp people who abandon due to imbalance issues are going to come back to a pve server and re-level to 60 just to play TBC? 
---
We have another year of this before they even announce a remake and if BGs don’t fix it, there won’t be any more remakes because people won’t put up with this indefinitely. The only reason it hasn’t collapsed so far is because people want to see what happens with bgs.
---
that is reasonable right?  do you think we will still be able to find another hunter? we could even give him first dib on tier
---
Pathetic as in the horde having to gank players 30 levels below them in the hopes that a level 60 will show up and give them a handful of the honor points that they’re apparently so starved for
---
Lol get wrecked
---
It doesn’t matter if it’s a small proportion (and it’s not, since you can see servers like Herod with 7-9k raiders accounted for, which is a solid 30%+ of the entire server pop).  Unless you think there is some significant difference in each factions’ likelihood to log raids (there isn’t), it’s going to give an accurate picture of the faction split.  Of course it won’t ever show you an accurate total population for a realm, but the faction split will be very close to accurate.
---
Nice
---
It's been really streaky for me. I've gone 110 or so taps without an AC then 2 days ago I got 3 AC in 12 taps. Then today nothing in 80.
---
RNG is RNG
---
its not the same game you used to play, whether people like that or not its the truth.
---
Hey I’m Drswole orc warrior on stalagg and I love the rare moments I catch an ally 1v1 in azshara. Even tho I lose 2/3 of the time cuz solo warrior is kinda hard into a lot of classes I’m down for it always. I wish people would actually put honor into the honor system, sorry about others on my faction :/
---
100% agreed.
---
I can’t confirm the WA as I have not used it. The macro that prints everyone with a lower GUID than you in guild worked though. I was able to figure out with accuracy two of the three people that would get hit. Best thing to do is just watch who gets knocked back on your first rag pull of the week and track them. Once we did that we confirmed it was the same three guys.
---
You can level a lot faster on PVE server.  I'm on Pagle, have a 60 mage, 52 hunter and a few lower level alts I'm slowly leveling with rested xp.  It's wonderful,  you should try it.
---
I find it odd that people always like to bring up ratios when talking about imbalance and pvp like all 70% of horde are out in the world dominating zones and not just afk sitting in cities
---
On Shazz EU two alliance raids going to black rock will be annihilated in 30 seconds.. there are always minimum 4-5 horde raids waiting.
---
what’s the macro? it’s guild wide and not raid wide?
---
But the guards fight back and they’re not doing it out of aggro range. If these guys were on the ground and attacking, it wouldn’t be an issue because that’s not against the rules.
---
Besides, there are 100 places at least in STV to fish, including right outside the horde base. 
---
There is only one flight master and major quest hub in Duskwood and safe-spotting means you can’t fly in or out or pick up/ turn in quests. 
---
No comparison between this and booty bay.
---
Differentiating between harm, help, and exists also allows to tie spells in in ways where you cast one spell if targeting or mousing over an enemy or another spell if you're targeting/mousing your ally.
---
After 10,000 BRM corpse runs this man finally snapped.
---
The key here is just to follow the loot rules and deal with it. If it's not on res then the pugs deserve to roll on it. The rules need to be clearly stated before the raid to all guildies and pugs, and by asking for an invite you are agreeing to those rules. 
---
If the hunter really thinks they deserve it and it is reasonable to ask relative to the other reserved items then have the hunter private message the raid lead and ask if they could reserve it. Its pretty simple, dont expect anything to be reserved if it's not explicitly stated.
---
Boars.
---
best 2 comments on the thread, well said.
---
I use WeaponSwingTimer. Works great.
---
So much this.  Imagine thinking "PVP" would be fun outside of BGs this time around, SMH.
---
Shouldn't the 4th (or potentially 5th slide) be distracting people off cliffs or into lava so they die?
---
I just checked on a sim sheet and it told me consumes / world buffs are a bit over 1/4 of my dps.  And more dps increases the raid speed by a lot because it means less downtime for healers, and potentially less healers with less stress on them.  
---
Most of the time spent in a raid is killing trash and bosses. 2-5 seconds between pulls doesn't making walking the zone take 2+ hours. 
---
You show me a raid parse that doesn't use consumables and takes meme specs and clears it in under 2 hours and I'll concede the point.  As it stands the only guilds that get close to 1 hour are guilds that try hard.
---
Just waiting for BG's, I do think it will get better. People might even roll alliance if the queues are too shit for horde.
---
If you’re Horde on heartseeker, I don’t think transfers will ever be available in classic.
---
Didn’t they just basically fix it this week?
---
There's a global Guild Recruitment channel on your server. Join it.
---
Also look in trade chat.
---
Oh, woops, you're right rofl. 
---
Nah, you definitely weren't.  Some people are just rabid for their favorite games I suppose.
---
Hunters can join if they want, or not.
---
I got 4 today in 8 dme jump runs.
---
&gt; So if people saw the serve was 45/55 A/H, they would pick alliance.
---
That's pretty optimistic of you to think that Horde over pop is just a consequence of ignorance, not choice.
---
My server was consistently polling at 60:40 - 65:35 in multiple polls on both reddit, blizz forums, and our 2 discords prior to launch. 
---
You know what it actually ended up launching with? 60:40-65:35, almost exactly what it had been polling at.
---
Everyone that overpopped knew exactly what they were getting into  when they did it.
---
Thats my server
---
Idk about you, but I feel kinda pressured to farm gear in order to survive a PVP encounter at all.
---
Half of them are also ther to do dungeons and you just run into them
---
Why? Shattering has saved my life WAY more than victory rush. Victory rush kind of sucks for everything but solo farming and it’s a nice little addition in bgs.
---
Pvp realms aren't the only ones that exist.
---
But they literally already own all the code they need to launch and run servers running WoW classic because it's classic WoW. Why would they need to develop anything? Or did they add extra features that were not present in original classic WoW?
---
I pulled it from here: https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dsy1ri/macro_to_find_your_globally_unique_identifier_guid/
---
There is a raid one that supposedly works with WeakAuras (the aforementioned Fight Club one) but I have not tested it yet.
---
I feel like those two spells are in no way comparable. Like one is for solo farming and pvp and one is for tanking....
---
No exp in BG's. This aint retail :P
---
Mmm I’m a warrior and I rarely get feared obviously because of berserker rage and warlocks still clap me cuz it’s an absurd class that has you press 2-3 dots then drain life until your balls explode and you win the fight at full health cuz of your healthstone and voidwalker shield.
---
&gt; **Been running with guild since almost the beginning of classic**
---
What are the ones after “go reroll to ret” and “tram rat”?
---
And the Giorgio Armani one? Why?! Is that a joke I don’t know about?
---
Oh shit, busted.
---
It's ok though you can go cry into that sweet sweet tax cut you got while lauding over your supposed empty dealership that you're supposedly the GM of.
---
You T_Der's are all the same, full of shit, and just like your pathetic cult leader need your fragile pathetic lives massaged every five minutes you make you feel better.
---
What wep do u have?
---
finally
---
Classic pop and, ironforge pro, same as people were misquoting and lying about earlier.
---
I think they can layer Outland separately from Azeroth and this might be the only way for classic tbc to launch. I could be wrong about layering
---
less time moving=more time DPSing. Maximize all your GCD's as best you can. If you are moving cast a life tap to gain mana and use a Global while you re-position. If you are good on mana and moving cast corruption(if you have a debuff slot), Shadowburn, or death coil to maximize dps. 
---
If you get really good at it, any instant cast you use, you can use to reposition closer to where you need to be during the 1.5 second global cooldown.
---
Man how would we know?
---
Is there any way to complete the linken quest chain (it’s a secret to everybody, starts in un’goro) if you’ve accidentally destroyed linkens sword? I’m at the part where I have to talk to the ghost near the Gadgetzan graveyard but he doesn’t have a quest to give if you don’t have the sword.
---
I transferred my alt to Earthfury and god, it's SO much more balanced there- highly recommend it
---
LFM does not = looking for more..
---
LFM = Looking for member
---
You can, but the group has to be willing to not skip any pulls.
---
My honor spy on ally faerlina last week had a pool over 6500 people. Thats 6500 people on alliance with 15hks. Servers are just a tad bigger than vanilla
---
I've found ironforge.pro to be the most accurate for most servers, and that one said 60-40 last I checked- which feels a lot more accurate than 53.8-46.2
---
Deetz?
---
Classic sucks
---
Name checks out, class checks out. 
---
'Go to retail' seems almost applicable here.
---
There are dozens of posts on it daily maybe a hundred a day. We care.
---
&gt;the leveling experience is better
---
Nah, Alliance quests are sooooo much more fun.
---
I quit my ally main on a horde dominated server cuz it's impossible to do anything. Can't level in open world. Can't get to a dungeon. It's unplayable.
---
Epic's take out the worst in People.
---
Ditto. Gotta get those cosmetics bro.
---
3 words; Cats Eye Emerald.
---
Good luck.
---
Me too, but blizzard doesn't think this way. All roofs in Graham and Evelyn ate trivial to reach, but shooting groin them is apparently bankable. Yes, even after the guard patch - my friend got awarning for it.
---
I thought there were quests in AV?
---
( I have no idea whether those quests give you exp. )
---
I need a free transfer to get me out of here
---
shocking!!!!
---
If a shaman actually spec elemental mastery they almost deserve to exploit spell batching to get an extra crit.
---
I never got this mentality. If that kind of "storytelling" should have continued we would have never had raids to clear. Even in Classic you kill a Lord of an Elemental Plane, a fucking Old God and the leader of the Scourge in Eastern Kingdoms. You arent a nobody anymore. You cant assume just because some players didnt do these things and stayed "nobodies" this would continue to be that way.
---
Classic exists in this weird place between true Sandbox MMO and Themepark MMO. Its neither. 
---
To be a true sandbox MMO it would require less restrictions imposed upon the playerbase, a hallmark of Sandbox MMOs is that players pretty much shape the world and there almos no NPCs of any renown. Examples are EVE Online or Black Desert Online.
---
But it also isnt a true Themepark MMORPG, with a coherent story, every player being a story-relevant character and every zone essentially being a Themepark with "rides" put there by the developer. Examples for that are obviously Modern WoW and Star Wars: The Old Republic.
---
Maybe thats what makes it so good, maybe thats what makes it weird.
---
You should tank it. Can't solo Ghazrilla until you're raid geared.
---
You may have seen baby gorillas being carried on the back of their mothers, but for the first few months after birth the mother holds the baby gorilla to her chest.
---
I love WOLTK but it's exactly where my character stopped being an independant adventurer to become this kind of a sidekick or minion of Bunch of NPC (Jaina, Sylvanas, Tirion etc) that i follow everywhere. 
---
Since Woltk it's no longer about the adventurer and his friends going around and doing whathever they like, no you're just a insignificant part of a bigger whole : argent crusdade, sylvanas/jaina minions, one of the noname that helped tirion etc.  The raids and the dunjons started being over-scenarised to the point where i don't feel like a adventurer anymore but just some disposable soldier following and taking orders from bunch of NPC that i don't really care about.
---
Having to self impose challenges to create any kind of difficulty is a hallmark of poor design.
---
Oh no, now hes going to be bottom of the meters instead of bottom of the meters!
---
yep, thats the beauty of vanilla "honor" system.
---
#nochanges btw lmao
---
i’ll initialize that on tuesday, along with logging correctly. i’ve been lazy, we usually do all 10 + ony in 2 or less hours. so I haven’t been logging, didnt really see the importance. but now that it interests me to fuck up the logging after i said I was gonna test the GUID theory out is a huge L, lol
---
Basically never.
---
The house across the street from the bs is the one with the hill behind it and usually they attack from there and I know they’ve gotten in trouble for that, but these guys are on top of the inn. 
---
You have to wall jump to get there and use a little “invisible” ledge to get all the way up if I remember right. Definitely a terrain glitch. Definitely can get suspended for doing it.
---
I notice since phase 2, there are a lot less players
---
Orcs are completely broken. The stun resist destroys all engineers, rogues, warrs, druids, and PALADINS the defining alliance class. Resisting a 1min CD HoJ is fucking devastating in PvP. Im a pally. I am straight up racist against Orcs. You are all KoS because of your BS racial. It feels like a 70% resist rate I swear to god. Resisting a HoJ is a game changer.
---
Give the alliance better guards on boats. They should at least have the same guards are horde zeppelins
---
[08:11:47][4][Beldyne]: ok lost confidence in myself, just lf5m
---
Uhh 45/55 is excellent, that's about the best you could ever realistically expect.
---
Does i stack with other moving speed effects etc Druid cat form? :)
---
The negative rate of subscriptions is probably the largest it’s ever been
---
You mean the supply that’s going to be oversaturated because every joe blow has 5 to 15 twink items stashed to sell or the demand that was way overestimated?
---
Lol 1k dkp bonus. You really need to make a post about this? What an OBVIOUS fucking scam. Whistleblow that shit and gquit. Tell everyone in raid 2 to gquit. Form your own guild with the raid 2 if you want. Don't stay in that guild for a second longer.
---
I mean you can perceive it however you want but it's actually the truth. Everyone said subs would drop from classic wow after a few months and they would drop to a point until they stabilize. We are still in the phase that it drops and we don't even know what the situation is going to look like a few months from now but soon will have a good idea of how the population will look long term. The alliance quitting right now will either quit, or come back for battlegrounds / BWL and so on. I understand that you're frustrated and you had this idea of what classic was going to be and this is not it but the truth is classic was always going to die. If we're lucky we will get TBC + Wrath before it ends but I have no idea.
---
Are you even a miner or do you just enjoy taking shots at Activision for personal reasons?
---
Yeah and there’s a hill you can use to jump onto the roof with a mount . This has been debated for decades now and the gm’s usually decide that any ally can come and get them on that roof that the gm won’t do anything.
---
Stalagg was probably fucked regardless of transfer
---
This video is Yang Gang on incendius and they've been doing it for a couple days. They pop up randomly and spam aoeon everyone flagged + kill the auctioneers. They have a constant source of honor as new people keep attacking and getting flagged as well as the fresh meat rolling in unaware of the situation.  It's actually fairly inventive honestly.
---
god damn people read for 1 second then spend the next 60 typing...
---
Lol that's a joke if I ever heard one. Camping towns against TOS lol. Let's just ban city raiders as well!!! What do you mean you are incentivized to raid cities and slay leaders???
---
I'm crossing my fingers as well but I don't really have high hopes.
---
I'm worried the battlegrounds are going to attract a lot of the people who are interested in fair fights, and I'll still instantaneously die once I step off the flight paths.
---
Yea im one of them...
---
That’s not bots it’s just people farming black lotus.
---
Did you even read the post before replying?
---
I'm 51 and enjoying the small chunks I play in, probably going to re roll pve and hit 60 in half the time and actually be able to log on and not get ganked or corpse run for half of that short amount of time. But dont rush, enjoy!
---
#nochanges
---
yikes.
---
Between the travel time and the actual time that each game will take, they're going to be out of the world more than they're actually in it. You will be able to play the game normally as long as queue times are not an hour plus.
---
I’m on Herod and can confirm it’s basically unplayable for Alliance. I’ve also noticed the huge decline in available players. IF is desolate and LFG channels are sparingly active at best.
---
Play the game or don't king of Reddit tears.
---
My guild recently started a second raid but only for alts, standbys, and friends. The core raid team is not allowed to run their mains in it
---
Unless you know how to get up there, you can’t get up there-you can’t just climb out a window on top level of the inn and get on the roof. This is no different from people going under sw and attacking flagged players who can’t get to you unless they know how to abuse the game mechanics.
---
There is a very specific set up wall jumps required to get here and one involves part of an invisible ledge. 
---
These guys are high levels, they’re killing players 30 levels below them. Why can’t they just do it from the ground?
---
Yeah I have the same feeling which extends to entire zones.  If I do one quest in a zone I have to do them all.
---
This was fine until I had to track down 20 savage owlbears in Hinterlands.  What a god damn pain in the dick that was.
---
That is your attempt at clarifying? Or attempt at being funny? You've achieved neither
---
Why is it different? You get weekly lockout on two raids. You get weekly honor to achieve. You even lose 20% of your ranked point so better grind hard every week if you don’t want to lose all your progress. Retail has weekly lockout as well some things what you can miss. But how honor is not worse than anything the retail offers?
---
Also in retail you will need 30% less artifact power every week, so if you miss a couple of weeks you can catch up. You can catch up to ranked pvp rewards as well. Also when new raid launches you can easily catch up your alt. Good luck getting to naxxramas in 1 week with your freshly dinged 60.
---
Balanced servers mean no one is safe
---
These are great options. Mining is great for them too. I think there is mithril in mara and solid stone will stay valuable well into p3 for sappers
---
You could also just not use a flair
---
Ewwww
---
People keep saying this website has been broken for months. ?
---
Instead you HAVE to grind a quite amount of honor just to not lose your progress for 1 week. Especially around rank 10.

If everyone in raid team 1 was ok with being more hardcore, why did your guild leader kick all of them out? What is the point of that?
---
Darkshore is for lvl 20-30. Those horde probably came up from STV, which would make them 30-40 at the lowest. How are they supposed to fight back when the horde levels show up as skulls?
---
Any of the spots where you can farm people without guards intervening anyone can get up to lol, how else are they up there? That didn't stop them from issuing warnings for the other spots, or altering guard behavior in areas where people most commonly did it to prevent it.
---
We had multiple front page confirmations on this sub that safespotting guards is a bannable offense before they patched BB, GZ and EL guards.
---
Tried replying to your other comment but you deleted it lol.
---
Ah, it all makes sense now. Appreciate the reply.
---
Some private servers had to offer Alliance additional benefits to help balance the ratio, such as lower respecc costs etc.
---
1.174% damage vs a boss target, 1.041% vs level 60 target(+increased chance to hit CC)
---
85 to 86% hit, 97 to 98% hit. Assuming OP already has 1% hit here.
---
What class(es) do you 5 box?
---
Oh yeah, those probably do.
---
You're not exactly going to be first in line to get the Leaf if you leave the guild and go somewhere else. You have no leverage here.
---
Pugs need an incentive to run. You can't get upset if they roll and win. The solution is to recruit more Hunters so that you don't have any pugs. That's when you can control the loot. 
---
If the guild leader doesn't put in any effort to recruiting, then maybe it's time to look for something else.
---
Lol no it hasn't. 
---
Unless by a long time you mean the past two expansions.
---
I'm not only not upset about them, I don't even know what the fuck you are talking about.
---
Elemental Earth, Darkmoon Faire items, Black Lotus.

You can't be both in queue and gank people

If you can't relate to this are you even a wow player..
---
Undead rogues will also stealth underwater in red ridge and wait for level 16s to come do the necklace quest and kill them until they gy Rez. I will never understand that mindset.
---
Whiner

If you're behind in gear, you'll get easily geared when you join a guild. Because you'll be taking everything they don't want.

yea i agree, but that gets to the very principle of reservations in the first place. It is 33-35 guildies out of 40 so i could say we are helping shitty pugs get geared. The hunter pretty much needs no tier loot anymore i dont think so its not like the pug(s) wouldnt be getting gear
---
*Alliance being roof camped by horde in darkshire*. Literally the first sentence of the thread.
---
But yeah, I guess **I** need to learn to read.
---
Loot council is normally the best for progression guilds, but Vanilla raiding being a joke, paired with how power hungry the majority of GM's seems to be, I'd bet that DKP is a lot better.
---
I've raided in a top 30 world guild for years before classic, where we obviously used loot council cause we werent chumps, and there I never had any issue regarding loot for 4 years raiding, just because everyone was really skilled at the game and knew that loot is just means to downing the boss.
---
In vanilla where everything is piss easy, loot is the goal. Any in my casual guild atm, the GM and his officers are corrupt as fuck, taking anything they need before the others while having some dumb excuse.
---
So we have a warlock with both T2 pieces, mage blade, belt from Majordomo, etc etc, at the same time as we have another warlock who has gotten one ring, for PvP, although none of them have missed any raids. And I feel like my example is extremely common in loot council guilds, thats why I prefer DKP
---
PvE Alliance will definitely queue up for BGs in droves.
---
For the first few days. I think it'll probably be a week or so after they drop that we'll see the "real" queues.
---
Proc ends up about 10-20% dps around lvl30. As a pally. Auto attacking a lot.
---
So keen! I’ll probably just raid log, so the occasional BG and play POE. I’ve got my gold and gear now, really waiting on BWL.
---
Timezones are basically the most complicated thing ever in software.
---
yea we are almost there. Guilds dont start with 50 level 60s ready to go lol
---
Over dramatic much? Population is evening out. In fact horde controls a lot of zones a decent amount of time and I always run into 20 hordes just riding the menethilboat.
---
What did you go through all the trouble cooking up this bullshit instead of just saying, “ow I did not know los affected resist chance”.
---
It’s ok to be wrong buddy.
---
Let's see the source on this claim pulled out of thin air.
---
I found a great template to use and just made it fit my UI
---
Well thank you for putting words in my mouth, Mr. Horde Rogue.
---
I knew Classic would be markedly different from Vanilla. That was one of the draws for me, actually: to see what the game was like now that it was solved.
---
What I didn't expect was being unable to play it unless I was in a raid group.
---
Lmao, yet another horde player desperate to convince people everything is fine.
---
No, several sites are extremely good indicators, like ironforge.pro. and your example at the end where no one uploads, is hilarious, as the website blatantly in your link shows that when no one is uploading scans, they *assume the population has stayed the same* not that no one is playing.
---
Being low IQ oof
---
We did this on Gehennas-Alliance. The only problem was that there were around 180 horde at BRD
---
Yeah I guess you are right. I played Vanilla back in the days and "unfortunately" I have not once been killed on landing at a flightmaster. Therefore I did not know about that sh*** now for Classic
---
I dont know, but probably closer than on actual hardcore PVP megaservers.
---
lol salt that people dislike your crutch addon
---
I'm replying to a comment, not the post, you idiot sandwich.
---
I understand what you mean, but why wotlk ? Wasn't burning crusade already like this ? I mean you're not really an adventurer anymore in burning crusade, you're a soldier in the fight against the burning legion, there are a few independent quests, but no more than in wotlk.
---
What would you have wanted to be done differently ? For your arrival in Northrend not to be motivated by the imminent threat of the Lich King but rather simply hunting new opportunities ? As in, instead of fighting for your faction, dragonflights, the argent crusade etc... just running errands for goblins, helping find a lost child, helping an archeologist explore catacombs, hunting game and sinking pirates ? But instead of having a "big important" quest chains to "odd job" quests ratio of 80-20, you'd want it to be 20-80 ? Have the main plot of the lich king be relegated to an optional chain among many unrelated adventuring activities ?
---
Did you want icc to not be a huge battle joined by several factions but rather you and your pals wandering in alone without the help of anyone ? Or did you even want the plot to not be about the lich king, or the plot to not even be a thing ? Like we're all just adventurers exploring some place with no greater purpose, raids are still about defeating bosses but those bosses are not threatening the world in any way, and there to be no recurrent npc character ?
---
Does it bother you in any way that in vanilla we're fighting big bad guys who threaten to end the world ? That we're aided and guided by big factions like the hydraxian waterlords, argent dawn, the bronze dragonflight and the cenarion circle ? And that it's sorta implied that we're not just doing whatever we like but are saving the world because we were asked to by figures of authority in the lore ? About the insignificant part, is it insignificant that we're literally the ones who managed to best algalon in wotlk and saved the entire planet that was about to get atomized ? Are we not adventurers, considering we're the ones of the first to set foot in the gigantic keeper compound with the aid of the most famous adventurer/archaeologist in azeroth, brann bronzebeard ?
---
I'm just trying to understand what you think is wrong with wotlk, exactly.
---
The first clip when the rogue turns around after the enemy got deleted 😂
---
It takes like 5 minutes tops to get to LHC from Undercity, ya?
---
You're living in fantasy land if you think Horde queues won't allow them at least 15 minutes between BGs to go camping and ganking.
---
then the real fun begins, cuz BRD and BRS are in BRM :)
---
Do you have any source on that? Would love to know how that was figured out. Is the characters ID visible somewhere? And if it's lower for newer characters, wouldn't it be an auto incrementing key rather than a GUID/UUID?
---
twink pvp is so fucking lame. wow you used sinister strike til they died.
---
I'm so tired of this. All my friends are quitting. Guildies are raid logging and now my GM is talking about quitting because we cant play the game. Sit in IF or die 50 times trying to do anything out in the open world. Blizz needs to step in and fix this. The server are too over populated. Open more servers and force people off the existing ones.
---
Yeah it's them hitting attack before I hit vanish, and I still get attacked. I was just wondering if that's what was going on.
---
Lul, it's just rng being rng. I got 5 crystals in an hour of mining this week.
---
I didn't realize undead was such a popular race.
---
We've talked about alt raids but it's not something that's become an issue. 
---
Our main philosophy is no one wants to be the second tier raid and no one wants to be struggling downing bosses. We'd prefer to just not deal with it and stay a smaller guild.
---
You can 2 man dme runs. I do it with a warrior and runs are about 15 min. Most of the gold comes from arcane crystals tho
---
Ragnaros was down on day 6 of launch, its been over 2 months, your guild should have a full roster by now.
---
Yeah I guess that's what going on. I never said it had to do with spy though.
---
Horde mage on Incendius, Gadgetzan in a nightmare. Always like 6 alliance mages just constantly attacking you while you’re trying to repair or sell.
---
what do you mean like looking for guilds that are leafed up to do 1 run with them?
---
Good for you! 
---
pvp edgelords never convinced me their server design is more fun than pve. If I want to pvp I can always raid a city or do BGs, otherwise I'd rather level/farm in peace thanks.
---
I'm pretty sure detect invisibility helps you detect invisible things not stealthed things although I could be wrong.
---
Fun fact.  For some reason, that's a quest horde can do too.  I didn't kill anyone while doing it, but I completed the quest on my classic shaman.
---
Sm/ruin is great for BGS and group pvp. Soullink is a beast spec for duels but sucks in raids
---
No. If you want serious raiding where it is tangible if/when you get some loot and where you don't have to deal with pugs and /roll, you join a guild that can provide this without having to invite pugs and rolling. Currently your guild is basically just doing a pug raid and losing items to pugs is completely normal.
---
You can ask them to reserve the leaf but don't be upset if they do not. Because reserving the leaf makes no sense at all, assuming they stick to the customary 1item+mats+legendary reserved. It just drops too often (50%) and too few people need it. Makes no sense for anyone organizing a pug to reserve the leaf as their one item.
---
Generally you'll have periods going without any loot, or any good loot, throughout classic. The way loot is dropping is just very inconsistent and random. Not getting your item after around 8 runs is not uncommon at all, even for the 50% drop chance leaf.
---
Wow, a lot of stuff to grasp here. I'd love to join something like that, but honestly, if the population is that low, it kind of ruins it a bit for me. 
---
I still love to raid and do dungeons, and if there are too few people online to do stuff with, that doesn't sound that appealing.
---
You can call them AltBae
---
Check! All is well on Dragonfang EU 😁
---
Well, besides the fact that they \#changed the game anyways by increasing the server cap.
---
and I was never in the \#nochanges camp, because I played on the pservers and knew how it would turn out. So I was for and still am for minor changes that compensate the game being 15years old and people min-maxing it.
---
And I've also liked all the changes Blizz made so far, besides layering. I think vanilla is just straight out the superior version of WoW (the absolute peak) but its not perfect, and some tiny modifications within the classic philosophy (they could use pservers are reference points) would make a great game even better.
---
You made your choice.
---
That's unfortunate? Good thing this is a social game and you most likely have a guild or at least know of higher-level characters that may rid Darkshire of this terrorizing menace.
---
That’s a lot of conjecture. I’m not claiming to know how popular logs are but I’ve never met anyone in either faction who does not use it. 
---
It’s another data ser you can compare to the numbers you are using
---
My friends fought HARD to roll on PvP servers. But I ignored them and rolled on PvE.
---
While I'm not happy being a Horde player on an 80% Alliance server, my experience is untainted at all. I can level, do dungeons, raids and PvP in Tarren Mill.
---
I even started leveling a paladin and transferred some gold through the neutral AH. So the whole imbalance thing is now working for me. In addition to the fact that the server started getting a ton of PvP refugees, boosting the population even more.
---
Couldn't be enjoying the game more. It was the right decision.
---
Man you got cheap flasks. Ours are like 120g
---
The majority of PvP realms. The PvE and RP realms are all alliance biased.
---
1% crit is worth as much as 10agi. the boomstick is worth 4 aep more    
---
   
---
the range enchant only affects the range weapon and not your melee. Range enchant also takes up a buff slot, so if you're not a hunter, its never worth enchanting.
---
well what if the raid isnt reserving anything else that run? just the standard
---
I can't understand why the f*ck would one pick a PvP server and then expect people to not come up with wild ways of killing each other.
---
No, I don’t think you do.
---
The commenter is saying as horde he thinks what the other horde is doing is annoying, just like you as a person.
---
Love you, bro.
---
It already happened.  Mutiny's whole raid team split and formed a new guild after the first couple weeks.
---
I actually remember this being common in gadgatzan or booty bay.  In fact, I remember doing it myself on my hunter.  it was a very different culture during vanilla though.  Despite that, Blis has said it's against tos and punishable, so you deserve whatever punishment you get if you do it in classic.
---
Here's the one that really bugged me.  I learned the hard way by having an alliance mage on a winterspring building roof attack my grounding totem.  That's apparently a hostile action that causes the guards to attack me.  Really feels like a bug imo.
---
Only 2-3 times? I had to stop and eat at least double that... but I’m running in mostly all leather fury gear. Might try some plate switched in to midigate damage more.
---
I know two months ago there was an hour to three hour que every night and multiple layers and there are no more layers and only a 30 minute que one night a week. 
---
I also know that I am often the only or one of a few alliance players in sight for hours in particular areas. And when I do /who on my brothers horde account, I can tell how many zones have 50+ horde players and how many have alliance players and I know the number has been shrinking for a while overall, but there are zones that have had zero alliance in them when there should be at least a couple. (Blasted Lands for example). 
---
If ques and layers are both gone, that means the population has fewer people. There are ways to tell if your server is unbalanced and ways to tell if it’s become more unbalanced in the past two weeks, beyond what the census (ironforge pro) sites say and if the sites match what you’re seeing, they’re probably statistically close.
---
Just one of them.
---
If you manage to get the head of onyxia, you can learn the recipient for the onyxia scale cloak. When BWL drops, every member of a raid-team is going to need one, so you’ll either be very helpful to your guild, or able to make a profit on the AH. ATM the cloak goes for 110g, with ingredients able to be bought directly from ah for about 25-30g.
---
Biggest jokes on all the horde losers who just HAD to grind their honor by any means necessary and ruined the game for the opposing faction. Now you have barely nobody to grind honor off of = no high ranks for you fucks. You get to sleep in the bed you made.
---
It already happened.  Most of the raid team split off after the first couple weeks and formed &lt;Invite for Layer&gt;.  The rest are scattered across several of the other top raiding guilds on the server.
---
If you have to adapt to the world being broken on a fundamental level, the game might just be fucking screwed, bud.
---
Way more often? Come on now. Also, you don't get axe spec till lvl 30, aren't we talking about a low level axe?
---
How is getting 2 people to come help you going to change anything about the 15 horde players on the boat? (All with a ton of sappers on every non-mage player)
---
*shrug* I'm on BB Hordeside, which is the very definition of a villiage.
---
There are PUG MC raids (hey Pay Me and Darmoon Faire !), as well as real raiding guilds.
---
&gt;  It's a more streamline track humanoids for every class, it just adds an easy /target command for you.
---
yah it's a crutch for shitters that's why it shouldn't exist
---
Get a new guild that appreciates u !!!
---
PvE servers &gt; PvP servers
---
Always have been, always will be.
---
Oh?  I'm curious now.
---
we will have more occasions to talk about it during the next drama of this sub :
---
" I stopped tagging in BGs because I have 0 chance to win ", " Twinks ruin the fun of everyone ", " It's more or less greykill ", " screenshot of combat log.jpg + wall of text "...etc
---
Exactly - technically he is gearing up his team faster, he just forgot to tell you the team he referred to was group 1..
---
Using Group 2 as a second chance at rarer BiS gear - either leave now or have fun losing weapons too G1 players.  
---
Straight up BS
---
I would assume it completely misses a lot of players like me that have never set foot in a raid.
---
If u don't have a succubus and not Soul Link spec, and a rogue gets the jump on you, there's only one option: You die.
---
at this point literally anyone who says that is just making fun of vanilla players who kept saying that, while not understanding why they were saying that
---
Except last time around, Horde were the ones with quick queues.
---
On Pservers any half way decent ally group would smash the horde in BGs.
---
To be able to swap between spells without having to wait for a cast, wait and recast to avoid over-healing, and most importantly (for myself) to avoid interrupts or lockouts especially in PvP.
---
The official website for the Classic Census Addon is:  [https://wowclassicpopulation.com/](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/) 
---
The reason why the other website was created was because the creater of the addon was in hospital the first weeks of wow classic and his website had an error which made it possible to access it.
---
By the way anybody can help make the data more accurate. Just download the addon and regularly count players and upload the data to:  [https://wowclassicpopulation.com/contribute](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/contribute)
---
I'm not alliance.  I've still reported many alliance for similar guard exploits, and I never see them doing it again.  It doesn't matter how many friends I have, because in order to engage against the people doing this you have to perform the same exploit they're doing.  I'll not risk my account by violating the tos.  You don't seem to understand the issue very well.
---
What's wrong with having auto attack as a bind? My alt is a warrior n just started doin a few pug raid with him and it can come in handy if i need to start swinging and have no rage built up and cant charge. It can be easier to tab to my target and hit 1 than click it. If there is a better way though I am genuinely wondering though, I'm always trying to improve.
---
Saying “water is wet” is not whining. 
---
I don’t have issues with playing the game, as I’ve said multiple times, it’s people like you I have issues with who pretend everyone is lying or complaining by stating basic facts. 
---
This is what the game is right now. Why are you so afraid to admit that it’s a much more challenging game for the under-balanced factions and the dominant side has it easy? 
---
I’m not afraid of hard mode. You refuse to admit there even is a hard mode.
---
Having it at this level was a change tho.
---
If the guild leader can’t even respect G2’s loot / players, what do you think will happen when they realize 5-10 players from G2 are doing more damage with less gear?
---
Well they poach from their own damn guilds, strengthening G1 at the cost of G2. Fuck these guilds!
---
Yeeeah a reply to a forum post doesn’t really count as an official response though. An official response will be a stickied announcement-type thread. 
---
Doesn’t affect my server, still not good enough for all those it does.
---
Maybe if you knew
---
a) what percentage of players actually raid at all
---
b) what percentage of raiders do upload logs at all
---
like BRE doesnt benefit the raid whatsoever if it goes to MT but  rhokdelar does
---
&gt;Wowhead's original population count from September is probably the most accurate one to this day.
---
It's not. It was inaccurate exactly for the other reasons you said. 
---
The only somehow accurate information you can get right now is by conducting a census on both sides for a realm on an appropriate time-slot. 
---
&gt;There won't be servers that used to be pretty balanced but have suddenly had half of one faction leave. That's not a thing that happens. What happens is that it went from 20+ players on both factions uploading data, to three dudes where two are on one faction and one on the other. That'll make things look terrible even if nothing has really changed.
---
There have never really been balanced servers except maybe the RP ones. Even Ashbringer, the "balanced" one in EU, has 30% more Horde level 60s than Alliance.
---
&gt; It's just not something that's actually happening. It's flawed data. Look at the last week's data uploads for Shazzrah on one of these sites. This is one of the biggest EU servers, and nobody uploaded any alliance data in the last two days. 
---
Ironically, the balance ratio for Shazzrah in that website (65/35) matches my own numbers (64/36). Most PVP servers in EU are around that. 
---
I offer to anyone in EU to run Census at the appropriate timeslots so you can see how the balance is. There are some servers where I can't because I have characters (so you'd have to be Horde), but that's just 3 servers overall. 
---
Any takers?
---
&gt; Census data sites are not accurate
---
No shit.  They are all unofficial.  Blizzard will never release the official numbers, so we won't ever have 'accurate' data.
---
I unsubbed when most of my guild did, ie a few days into p2. Apparently a big chunk of the server has too, because LFG is basically empty. I guess at some point the Horde will have some global hunting party to track down the last remaining Ally.
---
Why do they spam shadowbolt? Don’t they have the powerful DOT spells
---
It's weird seeing WoW players use the term "carebear".
---
I remember that being used amongs the hardcore pvp players in EQ, where on PvP servers you would lose experience, your gold, and one of your items when you died to another player.
---
Except even those servers had rules about picking fights outside of your level range.
---
Then they theoretically could reserve something. However, the decision to not reserve something is usually made by the organizers of a pug to attract more players because some players do not want to join groups with reserved items. Reserving something as common and uncontested as the leaf takes that whole point away while achieving very little benefit.
---
I know not getting your quest bow sucks for you personally but there are way more considerations about something like this than your personal loot. The leaf is common enough that you will win it eventually, but being patient might be required. (vanilla wow can require a lot of patience)
---
I think your options are:  
---
1. ask if they can reserve it but don't be too pushy or even upset if told no  
---
2. just be patient  
---
3. join a real raiding guild, not some pug thing (might be hard as hunter)
---
Bullshit,  spy simply uses info already available to the client.
---
roof camping is actually against tos, they can get banned for doing so
---
Pretty much my experience so far. No succ out? Just check your phone for any missed texts and get ready to corpse run
---
Looks great man! All this Alliance bias around here lately we gotta have some equality.
---
lmao warlock thinking he is getting mageblade over an actual dps caster
---
You probably just love to lead. Nothing wrong with that.
---
You need to unsub if you want Blizz to notice - and even then it’s minimal. If you’re still paying, they don’t care at all.
---
Again, that's irrelevant. Everyone is ported to the same spot after each battleground. 
---
One hearth per hour allows you to kill people in BRM for a few minutes before joining the next battleground. That's a hell of a lot different than what we have going on right now.
---
Quit until they allow transfers to PVE. Already un-subbed and I got 6 days of play time. Going to be relying on this sub to describe whether the game has become playable. Such a waste, Pre P2 was incredibly fun.
---
Well he said EU chat systems but its not all.
---
You beautiful madman !
---
It's slightly alliance favored, maybe 55/45 since phase 2 started. But horde players are more active in PvP, so it's pretty even out there. The control of Light's Hope and BRM changes often and the other side usually retaliates after.
---
On alliance side, there are plenty of guilds that focus and do a lot of RP, also plenty of those that don't. You run into rp situations out in the world every now and then, probably a lot more if you look for them yourself (at least that was my experience during leveling - after phase 2 started it seems rp happens mostly in towns).
---
You can't blame then when so many people wished for exactly this. All this hyped up talk about world PvP coming back and preserving the Vanilla experience with PvP system out before BGs. Lower population would make it more bearable but I promise you there would still be 3-5 man people camping certain spots and some raid groups in more important areas.
---
Interesting. I main a paladin amd I've never heard of hand of freedom. I do cast blessing of freedom all the time doe
---
Should've picked tauren rogue, newb.
---
Because that would be playing the game on hard mode and they are actually bad players looking to exploit every advantage possible so why would they handicap themselves?
---
It might be worth te reroll because of a single quest reward? Dude... No. Unless you are in an ultra progressive guild (which by definition is wierd atm, things are so easy, you don't even need consumables) it won't matter in the long run. 
---
This is onyxia and mc lol, phase 1 content. 99% of your gear will get replaced before or in phase 6. That missing ony neck will NOT stop you from progressing in further phases.
---
Would you seriously reroll yourself, if you had one single item you "picked wrong"? Since op is tanking we must assume they has some gear prio and that means they most likely has alot of his BIS already. Do you really think that one neck will make or break a tank? It's not like the alternatives are level 5 green necks...
---
Nice work! Got the link to the alliance one?
---
Serious question how is your view distance so large?!
---
I'm a developer myself, and spent a few minutes trying to trace the function he's talking about.  I gave up after looping back about 3 times, but the point is it's not clear what that function is actually sending or where without a legitimate code review which I'm not interested in doing at 3 am on a saturday.  It's certainly not something you can look at and easily agree or disagree with their point.
---
Also, interestingly, the addon seems to use locally stored database data.  Sounds like it'd be really easy to manipulate, and then have it happily broadcast whatever you want to everyone else using the addon.  It does clearly say it communicates over wow chat channels though, which is concerning.
---
I believe its more that we just don't see the issue from the same perspective. You believe that this is somehow a game-altering issue that requires immediate attention from someone with more authority than you. I see it as a player griefing other players while also putting themselves at risk of disciplinary action for going against TOS. It's the WORLD of Warcraft. Is it inconvenient being unable to use the services Darkshir offers, continue questing, etc? I'm sure it is an inconvenience but it's an avoidable inconvenience. Run a dungeon, go to another zone within your level range, etc. Options other than wait for GM to slap on wrist and remove from rooftop exist.
---
Reports do nothing. Ive report numerous offenders and weeks later they are still at it. Ive also reported highly offensive and vulgar names, still see them running around. Pretty clear to me the GM's on my server do fuck all.
---
this is the excuse every ganker says but the truth is the head for the hills the second reinforcements show up. just get good
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e3c2cd/i_have_made_a_free_updated_leveling_guide_for_wow/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share i think this is the one
---
Well maybe because your question is a good example of an utterly basic question that you could inform yourself about. 
---
Ironic that you're offended. You are the perfect example of the entitlement felt by lazy players, expecting their hand to be held.
---
This is what happens when you just give away titles of nobility willy nilly.
---
Death ray does like 900 damage most of the time and is never resisted, that's your opener after  you sheep them. Then you just kite them and kill them. You get shatter crits all the time, you can use a shrink ray on him to reduce his damage, you can use a green lens of frozen wrath, scarlet monastary gear, etc to get spell power. I've killed several level 60 warriors at that level.
---
And they suck.
---
Its white damage as well for hunters
---
Mage can poly/blink, lock&amp;priest can fear, pally can bubble, druid&amp;rogue can vanish, war at least has a stun whereas shaman can only slow...
---
Yes, older characters have a disadvantage on Rag (and Onyxia too before that was fixed). You want your Main tank to be as high GUID as possible.
---
I'm pretty sure it's both sides that do this bullshit
---
I'm guessing you're a mage? If so, talenting for it is a must, some things you can't skip and others can mess up the tries.
---
After that try it out with smaller packs, try 1-3 mobs and kite your way around. If you can do that without getting hit then it'll be the same for higher counts too. It can be frustrating when you fail and have to run back and waste 5 minutes.
---
I make sure to /train with every raid group
---
Well, I mean, you could not be a whiny little bitch, and just wait for bgs.  Dont pretend people are twisting your arm to make you do this...  You can use just an iota of self control, and not participate in the worst aspects of phase2.
---
1 ask if HE can reserve it as the guild is basically a dictatorship
---
2. Just put in effort for nothing? litterally nothing? 
---
3 sounds like what i should have done/ should do
---
Also if your Main Tank is the victim of Wrath of Ragnaros (one of the 3 lowest GUIDs), best course of action is to simply have your Offtank be ready to taunt and have Main Tank either intercept back or just walk out for a few seconds and let your Offtank hold it.
---
How badly did I fuck up getting staff of dominance over waiting for a mageblade? Was using blade of the new moon and spirit of aquetemas before
---
That's not how they operate.  More specifically, they can't operate that way.  Someone else will just do it.  What they do to fix these problems is limit the addon API to prevent the behavior causing the problem.  In this case it seems to simply be something which should have been done already.  Limit the amount of chat operations allowed by any specific client.  If this speculation is correct, and it's unlimited, or at least unlimited enough to cause this problem, that's a very insane oversight.
---
&gt;some damage over no damage 
---

My alt was 53 when it hit, holy shit questing is a no go, took 11 hours /played between like 54-55.. Brd/LBRS runs only way to get xp at this point, thankfully hit 60 on it yesterday
---
It's actually not that early, compared to vanilla its only 2 weeks difference.
---
So I've been raiding in a dkp guild from the beginning.  We get new people and I feel terrible because I'm way ahead of them, while already having a lot of the gear I want.  This is without the shenanigans of your guild.  
---
Let me address this in chunks.  It is somewhat normal to split raid members to allow them a better opportunity at select gear.  This does mean more gear for the new people, because there's a lot of pieces those people won't need.  It's also pretty sketchy already, because you know the saught after gear is going to go to those raiders.
---
The DKP bonus is outright cheating you guys.  DKP is intended to be a balanced system.  Ideally, you don't want more DKP going to the players than is being spent on items.  Ideally, if you start seeing a discrepancy you adjust item prices.  The significant bonus is enough to put your system outside the spirit of DKP.  It is legitimately cheating, and I can't believe anyone in the raid is ok with doing that.
---
Lastly, a really good DKP system will introduce decay not inflation.  You want people to spend DKP; that's the whole point.  You also want it to be fair and balanced.  1 way to counter this is to reduce the DKP of all members by a set number at a set interval.  There's no general rule, but it's something that needs to be discussed in your raid.
---
Dear lord, gnome players have to deal with that voice?
---
Same situation here on Kirtonos as ally. We just accept that you'll be corpse-running to get to BRM or DM, 15-30mins at least, to get inside. You might be very lucky and have an ally group at the entrance killing horde.
---
You sold your Supreme sweater because you’re poor lmao get fucked tiny bitch
---
Just imagine Classic with the class balance from TBC or WotLK.
---
Same. Guild mostly unsubbed, LFG is empty, farming impossible, no point paying. (Alliance ofc)
---
Bro no shit I just did the exact same thing on one of my two alts and I kept going in the journal to read the quest description because I was sure I was forgetting something. Nope just took a ridiculous amount of time. Fast forward a couple day’s and I bring the second alt in (decided on not playing the first) and shit you not I got it somewhere in the first three kills.
---
You can't explain it to reddit dads who are scared of red person in world.

Do you think it would be any different in reverse? If you had more alliance players?

Oh dear god thank you! Been driving me nuts.

I wouldn't really call it a fuckup.  Mageblade is better but not by much.  The main benefit of the mageblade is you can swap out offhands for pvp.

Well since " Blis has said in blue posts that this is a tos violation and will be punished. That is the only relevant fact here." I'd recommend you go back, take your own advice, and read the comment you responded to in which I clearly stated "I certainly support reporting it" as I also stated in my initial comment. If you only came state relevant facts you could have simply stopped responding after you commented " Fortunately Bliz has openly came out in disagreement to your sentiment. The reporting is just to slow to fix the problem in a timely manner."

---
It's kind of important to have more than 40 anyway, because it's inevitable that some of this 40 will leave before the subsequent raid tiers are released.  An alt raid, allowing raider overflow, is a great way to do that.  It's hard to have multiple real raid groups without something fishy going on.
---
Mousing over someone and hitting a keyboard button is not going to be slower than mousing over someone and hitting a mouse button. You could even argue the other way, since mouseover macros can be put on a single key, but a lot of your clique options will be modifier + button.
---
that too but in TBC Horde paladins get Seal of Blood at level 66, which is vastly supperior damage wise in PvE and PvP compared to other seals. The Alliance Paladins get Seal of Vengeance (the one which stacks up the dot) at level 66, which is nice for tanking but can't hope to compete damage wise with seal of Blood.
---
Except rooftop camping is bannable offense if you don't aggro guards.
---
The issue won't disappear with BGs though.
---
If the Horde gets a significantly longer queue than Alliance, do you expect them to AFK in org? Or do you expect them to keep doing what they're doing while in queue for max Honor?
---
Ask yourself that.
---
You know how I got my leaf? In a guild PUG run. I couldnt believe it myself. My friend and I were like the only two pugs and we got mageblade and leaf  on in one run just a month into classic. 
---
Thanks MOIST-guild!
---
Theres a method to my madness. 
---
But, that bar. That damn bar. I'd love to get rid of it. It refuses to go away. 
---
Down ranked spells. 
---
And my layout is a carryover from retail. Where there's enough spells to fill it out. Muscle memory I guess. And I'm cool with the size. To each their own.
---
I played vanilla from beta to TBC and classic feels nothing like it. I know what I wanted, I know what I asked for, but I didn’t receive it.
---
The problem is faction imbalance, and that’s why the problem really came to the fore in p2. Perhaps that’s why private servers took steps to preserve the balance...
---
Yeah, the batching is especially annoying for certain abilities on healers.
---
You can use your on use ability immediately after casting a heal, and it gets consumed by the heal already completed.  Literally applying your on use ability retroactively.
---
You are sitting there casting your flash heal filler, and then an emergency pops up.  You bust out your inner focus to toss a large heal, but woops!  You pressed it too soon, and it got burned up on a stupid flash heal you just finished casting as opposed to the greater heal you are about to cast.
---
I know they wanted the batching to introduce some fun things like mages sheeping each other, but the window of batching is just too large.
---
I can agree it should exist, it just shouldn't be anywhere near as large of a window as it currently is.
---
Any healer can test this by the way.  Spam some heals, and then use your on use ability *immediately* after casting your heal and it will get consumed quite often.  Inner Focus, Divine Favor, etc.
---
Doesn't help that he calls DKP inherently unfair.  This example is obviously tweaked to be insanely unfair, but it also breaks many of the tenants of DKP, so it doesn't make sense to call it that.
---
You're right.
---
I'm just sick of people complaining about getting ganked and camped while they choose to play on a PvP server. Everyone with experience knows this is part of the gig, bannable or not.
---
Apparently all the extremely social folks are browsing classic wow Reddit! Have an updoot.
---
does anyone know how %spell power apply to damage? Is it like (dmg) X 10% shadow damage = total damage, or is it something different? obviously damage would be spell power factored into the spell damage prior to percentage application. please let me know if anyone has a place i can find information on this
---
You have a 4.2% chance to miss a level 60 enemy. So it's still 6%. You need a whole 5% to cap and 1% extra hit rating because the first doesn't count for some strange reason.
---
Edgemasters and weapon skill only really shine when the enemy is 3+ levels above you (+5 weapon skill is the dame as +1 level), as when an enemy has 11+ defence more than your weapon skill you have extra chance to miss because a different hit formula is used.
---
If you're really worried about min/max damage, you'd only use edgemasters for level 63+ enemies only and use other gloves the rest of the time.
---
It's a really big guild.  I know a few weeks ago they were putting together an internal raid roster, but they actually didn't have a great population of raid-ready 60s whose schedules worked, as far as I can tell.  They ran a few split-guild pugs, and I think they have a raiding 40 now, not sure how good or progressed they are.  Hard to really gauge with a guild that big.  Definitely not a hardcore group, but not everyone needs to be.
---
This was just an experiment i hope to improve and make a  better list later.
---
And just to clarify when i put zones in the list i meant questing and not grinding (you probably know that).
---
Uninstall the game. You're infecting it with your bitter, anfi-fun assholery.

---
then i guess you forgot about that 6 week period of honor system without BGs
---
I can overwhelmingly agree with this.  I've never been in a fair loot council system, although I've been in ones where I personally benefited, despite not being the officers.  I've always felt like DKP ran correctly was fair.
---
Haha go get yourself a tissue.
---
It's easy to say this as a guild leader that is on top of loot council or gets massive DKP bonuses. "You don't raid for gear, do you?" or "We raid for fun" is such a bullshit.
---
Yes, as a feral tank this dude watches how almost every other class in the game is obtaining epic tier pieces, epic weapons and off-sets, while he does some heavy lifting tanking and getting nothing.
---
What a lot of people don't seem to realise is like most MMOs of the time, WoW was built around grinding. It's the most effective way to level, it makes up far more of your experience than quest rewards. Quests are simply a way to keep you entertained by providing a framework to your grinding and keep you moving through the world.
---
Later on this shifted, with more and more quests where you have to do some weird shit instead of farming, quests with reasonable drop rates etc. But the simple fact is that classic wants you to grind, because vanilla wanted you to grind. You may get lucky on some quests, you may get unlucky on others, but that's the point, it's just about varying the grind to keep you from being conscious of the grind and getting bored.
---
It's one of those key bits of design that contributed heavily to WoW's success, and something a lot of wow clones and even wow itself didn't take advantage of over time. My partner loves grindy eastern MMOs where they don't try to hide the grind and I find it soul crushingly boring and pointless, but doing basically the same thing in wow where I'm incentivised to keep moving and get mini 'completion' rewards for steps of my grind...that I enjoy. It's all mind games.
---
Besides the overpopulation on servers, vanilla was exactly like this. Why do you think they added guards with rifles and knock backs?
---
Unless you are the lowbie.....
---
Will do.
---
Let me know when you find that companion for your adventure buddy!!
---
why not hold your tongue until BGs at least? there was a mere 6 week period in vanilla that was like this.
---
I'm in a loot council guild, isnt even that tight nit community, but the loot distributed rather fairly. Guess I'm lucky.
---
I’ve seen multiple comments and threads that are agreed on that it was not like this in vanilla at all.
---
So, again.
---
The answer should be in the still early phase of the game it should be unplayable for a certain faction for six weeks? Sounds like a bit so great plan
---
/dump UnitGUID("player") although you'll then need to convert from hexadecimal to a raw numerical value accordingly. There are ways to code the script so that it pulls the numbers of your entire raid (or just certain classes in your raid) and auto converts them, but I'm not sure how my guildmate is doing that ^^
---
Its always been like this, its just exacerbated by two things.  One servers have far larger populations than the game was designed around with zero action being taken to balance the factions.  This makes faction imbalance become more and more of a problem as the population gets bigger.    
---
The other thing is everything is already known in WoW classic.  Everybody already knows how to clear all the "challenging content" knows the best ways to get the best mats and recipies, and how to easily get BIS stuff or damn close to it.  You dont have to sort through piles and piles of unorganized info, wowhead, icy veins, etc all have the data nice and organized so people know exactly what to do when to do it and how to do it.  
---
That leaves the upper level characters with nothing to do...so they do this.
---
I can't believe i took this seriously the first time i saw it..... well i am a horde player so i don't understand the struggle of being an alliance player
---
yeah, now I definitely see the the corrupt lootcouncil that gears horny officers and their friends. With this mentality you will award a Vis'kag to a semi-green warrior with Thrash Blade rather than to a rogue in full pre-bis and dal'rends. Because you know, the semi-green RL friends needs it more.
---
While I agree with you, I don’t think that OP is alliance. You can see the red nameplates of the Horde players on the roof, and he’s clearly a human.
---
I'm a member of one of those guilds: It doesn't matter. Hell, you might even be a bigger target because the horde may hope you'll call in reinforcements since they're honor starved.  
---
If you wanted to make it into BRM with maybe 2 or 3 corpse runs you would need a 20+ man team. Do you really think we'd have 20+ people dedicated to getting escorting a 5 man(at most) team into BRD? No way, our MC raids is another story though.  
---
Horde simply have overwhelming numbers. And if they don't out number you 2 or 3 to 1 when you first encounter them, it won't be long before they do since your presence won't go unnoticed by others for long. It's amazing to see how many of them come out of the wood work.  
---
It's a completely different experience than most are used to. We legitimately have multiple 10 man horde teams running around Ironforge at least once a day usually. A shaman and some mages decided their best honor per hour method was to wait out their 2 minute spawn timers, spawn near the mailbox/ah, then chain lightning/pom+pyro over and over and over.  
---
Regarding the top parsing guilds: The only things that world PVP factors into are tribute buffs, songflower, and getting into the instance. The first two were a hard requirement before phase 2, but now there's simply no way to guarantee you won't get jumped by a massive glob of horde and lose your buffs.  
---
It's simply that fucked up out there.
---
Generations change. 
---
People care for doing the difficult thing and getting awarded for it. They want easy wins. 
---
Isnt this the whole idea why wow collapsed in the first place? Make epics free, make raids brainlessly easy to complete casually, make pvp increasibly forgiving, gold flows freely, make every player a god in the world carrying legendary rather than a soldier in a big army...
---
I think all of this has the same logic behind it. And such people (they existed also before but were rare) just want that life, wait near fp and 5 man kill people. 
---
Ganking was also way common back than but it would be mostly 1v1. Now everyday as lvl 55 pally I get ganked like twice per hour by a 5-man group.
---
This is called parry haste and is real thing.
---
Sounds great, how do you utilize stealth?
---
This is typical 2 raid guild behaviour, you would be best off convincing them all to leave with you or just joining a better guild.

You can’t compare boats and zeps; they’re completely different in terms of ”safety” from the opposing faction.

You chose to play hord on an imbalanced pvp server. Your fault while you wait in queue for BG.
---
The worst with all this p2/transfer fucked to me, is that it is somehow destroying the classic community we built because people are just trolling each others now. 
---
Big congratulations to blizzard for this one.
---
Classic was about community ? Blizzard don't understand or give a fuck about game community anymore. At least, top management don't for sure.
---
Welcome to the only way to experience Classic as it was in Vanilla: PvE servers.
---
PvP happen in Tarren Mill or the occasional gank if you leave PvP open. Aside from that, things are as they were intended.
---
Already unsubbed. Game went from nostalgic fun to shit overnight.
---
Unsubbed this week with level 56 warrior. 
---
Release of world pvp was awful with the lag, I couldn’t login for 2 hours straight and then I would get disconnected immediately.
---
I can’t quest because of the roaming death squads. The only instance I can do is BRD which is fine but if I fly to an adjacent flight path, packs of Horde murder me. If I somehow get away from the flight path, I have to dodge more roaming death squads until I finally get into the mountain and then there will be a death squad on point for the lava jump. So after dying and getting down to the quarry, there will be more people wanting to murder me.
---
It’s like a conveyor belt of death and it sucks because I only have a small amount of spare time to actual play the game. Since honour was released, my game time is spent in Ironforge LFG, dying trying to get to BRD and then finally actually doing BRD. If I have 3 hours to play, one hour is guaranteed to be wasted with “pvp” bs.
---
My server is severely imbalanced like it’s a 70/30 horde/ally split. Only solution I have is to reroll on PVE server but why should I have to.  I can’t move my character and Blizzard have no desire to publicly acknowledge faction imbalance let alone fix it.
---
So thinking of playing the game lead to severe apprehension and a foreboding feeling of boredom/exasperation so I’ve quit. Trying to play the game as ally as the minority faction late game seems like a giant waste of time.
---
But human is on the alliance, and red name plates are enemies...?
---
Are you the octopusbread in onslaught on skeram?
---
That's a lot of words to say "nuh-uh"
---
This has nothing to do with the addon. You can keep a combat log open (with the right filters) notice an enemy player named steve is around. type "/tar ste" then hit your petattack key.
---
Yes the addon makes it easier but any addon that gives you a list of clickable names for nearby targets would do the same. 
---
i believe you can also accomplish the same thing by just increase the targeting radius of your tab key and spamming tab/pettattack.
---
You had said that OP “as horde” was annoyed at the other Horde. OP is alliance. Semantics but whatever I suppose
---
Not much experience with other timers but quartz has always been my go to swing/shot timer. Super low screen footprint and very clean.
---
Have the hunter message the RL/GM about it and see if it can be reserved and if not, ask him why not.
---
If I have to wake up at 5am(ignoring my other life duty’s like work and university) the game is fucked. That is not a reasonable expectation to ask anyone, and I think most people would rather not pay $15 a month if they had to wake up at 5am to get a use of it.
---
What a power move. 
---
“Looking for five more for group. Dibs on Loot. Just mail it to me when you’re done”
---
DKP only works as a self-contained system, zero sum
---
Artificially injecting 50 boss kills into that system for certain players is basically just a badly run loot council.
---
Honestly I never want to be in a guild that has a second 40-man raid group. Not only is that way too big for genuine connections to form, it's inevitable that an 'A' team forms, and I have never ever seen that situation end in anything other than the majority of the 'B' team leaving to form their own guild, or splitting off to join others, because in no universe does the hierarchy ever change. B team get nothing.
---
Now is the time for that cycle to continue with you.

Because its relatable af
---
Zeps are a bit safer yes(not by much though) but the point wasn't about comparing the two, it was simply that you are taking risks when traveling in the world.

Thr world isn't meant to be safe everywhere you go. If you want that, there is pve servers.
---
You can make a macro to target the flight master, but you'll have to know his/her name. Then make sure you have Interact with Target bound to a key in your keybindings menu. Hit the macro to target, hit your key to interact with him/her and click on a destination.
---
&gt; It CAN work, but that said, it's not really a good idea. It makes life a lot harder on the group, so not the best option.
---
&gt; Without any real mitigation abilities, or taunt, also having minimal threat generation, not a good idea.
---
That's a very outdated way of looking at things. Atm shaman tanks are indiscernible from paladin tanks when it comes to raid tanking, my server has tons of shaman tanks that clear content the same time it takes for a warrior to do it. there's an article that explore [this subject](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=1150) in great detail. If you're interested I'd definitely recommend you take a look.

Haha reading this random thread and here you are still debating server side. It seems you at least agreed it's more than vanilla now, since you yourself is saying 7k and that's double vanilla size. You're still wrong though. Plenty of servers on 15k+. Cool to see you admit you're wrong though.

&gt; Meme specs are things like Ret pally, enhancement shaman, and moonkin that are not competitive in a raid environment for dps. Those are probably the big 3.
---
Idk when's the last time you played but none of these are meme specs. They all do WAY more than the required dps to kill boss. Im guessing you're saying they're "meme" because the numbers are not as gigantically inflated as a warrior and seconds matter for you in a fight because you need to make it in time for supper?

Quite frequently? It limits sending a message to the sync channel to every 60 minutes doesn't it? Assuming server time is returned in seconds, cause it wouldn't need to send one every 60 seconds.

Hordies doing backflips trying to prove to alliance that it's not so bad.

Dunno guys, pretty playable to me. 54lvl Warlock, 34lvl Priest. EU, Gandling, Alliance.

I imagine this all being something like a war or zombie apocalypse IRL: you have to fight to survive; you have to minimize travel, try to avoid choke points ; it’s really a time for the worst to manifest in people; etc.
---
Questing is impossible for 30+, forget it. 
---
Dungeons are also not easy to come by, due to a lot of travel, time wasted searching for the group, camping at the entrances.

So grinding in relatively safe places it is. Like Indensaurs cave in Searing Gorge, Azshara beach.

The community doesn't understand or give a fuck about game community anymore\*. Fixed it for you, because that's the real problem here. We cannot blame Blizzard for how people are playing the game. This is 100% on the players for how they choose to play the game, which is toxic to say the least.
---
Whatever the case, this subreddit will find a way to complain about the current state of the game lol
---
I can give my contribution but I doubt it will resonate with you. 
---
It's about personal experience in similar situations. I have played a Korean MM MM since 2004 called Lineage 2. Every year couple of private servers would launch and because of the nomadic nature of L2 players after launch several guilds would race to level and get gear and then start contesting high level zones where the most valuable stuff is. If you are not part of their guild you'll be killed on sight. Nobosy gets access to the good stuff because later on castle aieges happen and top clans want to win them. People wait 8+ hours for a boss every week to spawn after being killed and his respawn window starts ticking and nobody else gets to see it for months. That game has only world bosses of sorts. Massive pvp is the only way to play end game.
---
100% agreed. The market moves on news. Same thing happened to PvP consumables when news of P2 dropped, and everything went down in price patch day.
---
&gt; Why does the ultimate meme spec get no love, full melee survival hunter?
---
Full melee hunter is very much a thing
---
and has been calculated/tested on pserver to deal the most dps in the game for hunter. [this highlights](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=1542) the essential of how to play a melee hunter quite well.
---
If you would sever relationships over one item, you're not loyal and you're going to have problems no matter where you go.

Don't forget scolo and strat for 57+. A lot of good gear there.
---
Alliance on Rattlegore. 
---
Nuff’ said.
---
Honestly: I feel for the people, but I cannot understand how this is surprising. We saw the numbers of people starting on servers. We had census estimations of many realms well above 10.000 active players. Those numbers on a PVP server with layering soon to be disabled? You really had to see it coming. And if you dont like it why not start on a PVE server where this cannot happen?
---
At that point: why be in that shitty ass stitches guild? 
---
Clearly you are better anywhere else that can assemble 40 people.
---
Add guards to the lower deck of zeppelins as well, there's whole alliance raids camping them. Goblin guards can't do anything if they can't target people.
---
Unfactual
---
I do not remember exactly how it was in vanilla, but from what I remember I had no doubts that PvP servers will be like they are now. That is the reason I have never really considered playing on PvP.
---
What did you expect from PvP servers? It was clear that no additional balance or control will be in place.
---
You made a conscious decision to roll on a PvP server bc you didn’t think it would be bad. Others rolled PvE because they didn’t wanna risk it. Now they’re reaping the benefits and you are so angry and butthurt for not going PvE in the first place that you’re picking on people who did. Grow the fuck up.
---
And especially now that there’s such a larger population on each server, it will be easier to match them. Personally I’m super excited for AV

This is one of the most Stockholm syndrome posts I’ve ever seen lmfao. 
---
The current state of the game is not good. People aren’t just quitting because they aren’t capable of ‘gitting gud’ it’s because the honor system is cancer without BGs. No one should have to play like this.
---
EVEN THE PVP GRINDERS HATE IT :)
---
I played vanilla and this is a far cry from a genuine and #nochanges experience.
---
Ahh yes i seek to have forgotten
---
Just do sp til you get a second one, that's what I would do. Best for pve and still helpful in pvp.
---
&gt;	I hope that the server has filtered out the people that prefer a PvE experience and don’t know it
---
This is may be the best post about phase 2. So many alliance are complaining like phase two brought the end of days to wow classic, but in reality there is a huge subset of players that are having a fantastic time still that’s carried over from launch - those on PVE servers and those who truly meant to roll on a PVP server.
---
If you’re not in one of the two groups above then you sadly made your own bed and are having a shitty time in it. From the get go it was well established that servers were going to be much larger than vanilla and also that layering would be gone by phase 2, meaning that whole population would be roaming for WPVP and you would be flagged and vulnerable as a result. Also, the imbalance between faction has carried over from retail since horde have better pvp racials. If you still signed up for a alliance pvp server experience, then this is the path you chose and it’s not blizzards fault.
---
I’m really glad to read you’re having a good time OP. I come from horde on biggelsworth where it’s similar ratios and am glad to say I’ve encountered some great alliance pvpers/groups. Good luck!
---
Scanning combat logs faster than a speeding bullet.
---
It's incumbent upon the provider of the service to take predictable human behavior into account and adapt to that to properly provide the service.
---
Blizzard chose to create imbalanced megaservers. This is 99% their fault. 
---
Imagine that a nation built an entire electrical grid that did not have even 1/4 the needed capacity and permanently breaks when goes down for the first time. Will you blame the people for crashing the grid with air conditioners during a heat wave? Will you blame them, a few weeks later, when starving people hunt all the local wildlife to extinction? When they start to rob each other? The powers that be could have just used a normal power grid and none of it would have happened. I don't blame the people.

Materials for Ahn’Qiraj war effort
---
Materials for Zul’gurub items/consumables/enchants maybe
---
Materials for any alchemy stuff that’s needed for BWL/AQ/Naxx
---
... to every town except alliance ones.
---
Oh I know. Do one with arya and the night king.
---
&gt; Yeah and how does some MP5 on melee gear, which is rare af help you on earthshocking for 300 mana every 5 seconds?
---
&gt; Sure you can do it. If you spam major mana potions and dark runes you should be able to reliably hold aggro for 2-3 minutes before going oom.
---
I linked above your comment a guide I found recently that should answer your question.
---
Rockbiter adds fixed threat per second, so weapon speed doesn't change the threat over time. I like fast daggers for quick target swapping, but if you're playing an orc you might as well make use of the racial.
---
Daggers can get some spelldmg (threat), axes get better defensive stats.
---
What did he do that was immature enough to deserve that comment?
---
You rolled on pp server hurr hurr
---
Hahahahaga youre the little rat that gets offended by rude names. Or maybe just got owned by someone with a rude name and decided to report so you can feel like a winner
---
Arcane!
---
What the hell? 
---
1. He's reserving stuff for himself
---
2. Guild is before pick-up players no shit
---
Hurr hurr im a brainless regurgitation machine hurr hurr pp server
---
You forget gear is not that important for pvp than it is for pve. It does help of course, but it is not the deciding factor
---
Who cares about people who do raids? Now since P2 is out a lot less people will actually do raids because you can get quite decent rare pvp set by just doing pvp.
---
What is all the raid gear good for if most of the raiders sit afk in IF and don't do any world pvp.
---
P1 was perfect! Sometimes they killed you others didn't care. Never truly safe but you knew some out there didn't care. Now everyone is blindly killing everything
---
Can you even use hs in combat?
---
pretty sure thats a guild on like 6 servers
---
Reporting high ground offenders absolutely it’s griefing and game abuse. Anyone who’s verbally abusive report, no problem.
---
Reporting highly “offensive” and vulgar names, get lost. These people either fall into 2 categories - no sense of humour or looking to shut down anything they find offensive, ironically the offensive is nothing to do with them but their opinion the offended group needs to be “protected”
---
Runes basically have to be farmed in the early mornings.
---
That addon works just like it did then, they didn't actually do anything about it.
---
That amazing feeling when you are playing on PVE server and just enjoying the game =)
---
I was 56 but managed to do Scholomance to 60 on rested xp, won't matter now though because they kill lvl 60s too
---
&gt; PvP items. I bet he also reserves legendaries for himself too. And materials. He's the leader, that's his reward.
---
Holy shit. THATS THE DEFINITION OF ENTITLeMENT. And you tried to pass lecture on entitlement
---
Vanilla H:A ratio's were usually skewed towards more alliance. Horde was almost always outnumbered until TBC came out.
---
O K Z O O M E R
---
Want to pvp. Also want to play the game. Difference between pvp in the world and not being able to do anything without getting ganked.
---
How are people so thick that they keep saying just go pve ur stupid lmaoooo
---
Being snarky to actual feedback. OP bites back at people saying he should go PvE while sucking up to people agreeing with him that PvP servers aren’t fun. I guess that’s Reddit in a nutshell, but this guy doesn’t want help, he wants to complain. He said it himself, he’d rather quit the game than reroll, well then quit already and stop posting the same post on this subreddit. It’s been like this all phase 2 and I’m sick of it.
---
This is just some backwards ass logic.
---
&gt;PvP items. I bet he also reserves legendaries for himself too. And materials. He's the leader, that's his reward.
---
But then you say 
---
&gt;If you start reserving actual useful items for one person, then you have to do it for everyone else in the guild.
---
PvP items ARE useful. So are legendaries. So are materials. 
---
I'm 100% sure you're one of those tanks advertising "Will run any 55+ for all non-bis" who demands loot lead because "epics aren't BiS".
---
I once rolled a night elf mage on retail when they came out and went to orgrimmar. I was shadowmelding and then bursting on some people then become invisible, hide and shadowmeld. Was fun.
---
I saw a horde engage in a 1v1 yesterday without calling a raid for backup. Highly unusual behaviour.
---
Is it unreasonable to hope to be raiding by p3 if I’m playing 28+ hours a week and lvl 32 rn?
---
Maybe it have to do with a fact that you can't attack children NPC of opposite faction.  
---
So it looks like they are in both factions at the same time. Sideeffect of this would be ability to get quests from them)
---
I'd take a transfer at this point. Loved vanilla PvP and phase 1 but my everyone in my guild and server is raid logging.
---
I feel like that's up to the hunter to decide.
---
If he is fine with it, there isn't even a problem to begin with.
---
??? I don't even PVP because it's unfun. How is running around in a 40 stack finding people and corpse camping them fun? I see 0 point. It's just stupid and a waste of time.
---
The only PvP I've done in p2 is 10 v 10 scrims vs a friendly ally guild
---
I really like the idea of population based log in times/ques so that the servers are forced to be more even. 
---
The problem is that it would be unfair to raiders of the majority faction. So some option to log in and only raid. Maybe an option that logs you in but you can only attack if you’re inside a raid instance.
---
I mean having to gank players that physically cannot fight back seems more of a pussy move. They could always go to Southshore, plaguelands or w/e and fight 60s.
---
I once had a 1v1 battle with a human warrior, he lost
---
I was 46 when phase 2 launched. Use the translator website and make a macro to yell "worth no honor" for the next couple levels. Saved me a few ganks.
---
The mentality of players is a much bigger change that Blizz can't control. Honor system was destined to be a shitshow because it was a poorly designed system that was scrapped very early on in wow's life cycle.
---
Unless Blizz creates a time machine we're not getting actual vanilla experiences back.
---
What is paladin amd?
---
I'm a dad so I'm gonna have to call that projection bud ♥
---
Should have joined a pve realm duh
---
Youre missing the point. People are not saying "make the horde stop killing alliance" we are saying fix the unbalance and overpopulation before all the alliance players quit cus they cant play the game... what you are suggesting is for people who wants balance to reroll on a pve server? Thats just ignorant...
---
The solo content is harder than retail and the group content is significantly easier than retail (for hardcore players)
---
I wish retail would look at more difficult solo content
---
You're saying first 3, do you kill lethendris too? just my opinion but I think it's a waste of time. You're supposed to kill hydro, zhevrim and the last one. For full run you want at least 3k health, I have 3,5k and you want siphon life to tick for 68 so around 350 spell power. Also you really really want to play sm/demsac build, it's much easier than any other. A tip: keep soulstone up at the last boss, if you die after the door opens you can ress, kill imps, skip the boss, mine. Also if there are only melee plant ads in the boss room just pull them with the boss, more siphons make it more forgiving. The only times you can die if the boss uses wither like 5 times back to back. Use health potions and stone, dying sets you back way too much.
---
You got me there. But i still think that Silverpine is better mostly because I've played through it twice on Kronos and because i know all the quest which is kinda biased
---
I'd stick to wow classic population activity data. Run your own census addon to make it better as well!
---
&gt;Should have rolled Horde. Sounds like you wanted the PvP in YOUR favor and its not turning out that way.
---
Let's be real here and stop pussyfooting around.
---
Seriously. Probably some puffed up camo slathered stump-humper who can't enjoy his cheerios before kicking his dog. His undead warhorse has chrome plated truck nuts.
---
I like him.
---
He makes it look like a lot of fun
---
Theyll help because ill be the one not leaving the city and raking in honor by actually having fun in BGs.
---
Solo farming turtles for golden pearls? I always thought the nagas were the way to go :o!
---
Nah. I've done those in the past and the amount of people who screw you over and roll need on items (even though they agreed up front that they wouldn't) makes it not worth my time. All it takes is one person rolling need on your orb and that's an hour of your time that you can't get back.
---
I did run a half guild / half pug MC on my alt a couple of weeks ago. Some of my guildies wanted to reserve items, but I insisted that we give pugs a fair chance at loot. I'm a firm believer that this is the only way to get good players in your group.
---
Sure enough, we managed to pug 3 Hunters who already had Rhok. The leaf dropped and no one needed it.
---
Haha mage pve rotation simple just one spell.
---
Or whats the joke? Handjob?
---
"pVp HaPpEnS iN pVp SeRvErS"
---
Depends on what gear he has, and how much time is on the alt. If youd rather play an alt than gear up your main, then clearly he isnt that dedicated to raiding.
---
That's exactly the way to empty your server of the opposing faction. No etiquette, no rules, no boundaries. Just fuck everyone up and make them stop playing. Enjoy your 60 min wsg queue in 3 months once people got fed up with your bs
---
Where are the statistics? The only ones I've seen are the websites that show a 50/50 split from a couple of months ago
---
Can do a census yourself
---
Make a level 1 and do /who warlock 60 and record how many there are. If over 50 it shows as 50 so change it to /who warlock gnome 
---
Can do a census pretty quick.
---
We did it on stonespine EU for just level 60s, it was 65% horde 35% horde.
---
Reroll on a PVE server.
---
Yeah I don't get why that happens constatly either.
---
Literal lie btw, but w/e Imma upvote anyway cuz fuck horde lul
---
Tons of raid loggers on my server that will show up in logs that shouldn't be counted towards faction balance.
---
If you guys are struggling to fill your raids then it's kind of an unwinnable situation for leadership. Need bodies. 
---
If you guys are easily filling raids but leadership expends no effort to route a 20% DPS increase to someone who attends every week then  leadership is questionable. Either they haven't noticed that their Hunter still has a crossbow or they don't care enough to reserve leaf for a week or two until he gets it.
---
A super balanced. Most census pages seem to show only about 1% difference in factions.
---
how do you think paladins bubble hs while in combat
---
I mean.. I quit
---
a weakaura
---
Lol Gotem!
---
Would you skip a roll on baron cape if you would be him?
---
Ok boomie
---
Just dinged 50, any tips on where to level now without being camped by 60s?
---
You need to be unemployed and truly reconsider your life choices if you need to adapt your schedule to  
---
a 15 year old game
---
Maybe he should have joined a more casual guild then.
---
I don't know if I'm odd but if I am ally I only play gnome or dwarf female if I can for the class and for for horde I will play anything male. Except tauren then it must be female.
---
God love reddit normies. Its just infested with other low skills idiots. Go across every subreddit and you will encounter the shit haha. Don't join a pvp server if you are going to complain shitter
---
I'm pretty sure horde has better PvP racials even in classic though. That's a pretty agreed upon both in game and on this sub which is why we see the horde imbalance on PvP servers (even before transfers opened) and alliance advantage on PvE servers.
---
I kinda disagree, you are pressured to do shit, but I think the things you’re pressured to do are more loose and set by the players. For example, I farmed ZF gy ~40 times in order to get my epic mount so I could keep up with my guild pvp group. I’d definitely consider this a chore, but it was so worth it
---
Duskwood
---
To play the devil's advocate, if a guild is in a fortunate position that their raid spots are full and sadly some people need to sit it out, then I'd also give spots to those who put in the effort.
---
I personally havent even started levelling an alt until my char was fully ready.
---
Dirty
---
It do be that way
---
 [https://ironforge.pro/servers?region=eu&amp;filter=true](https://ironforge.pro/servers?region=eu&amp;filter=true) 
---
Mograine showing 60/40 split, basically.
---
Poor guy
---
Dunno... Basically just raid logging on my pally now. Got no interest to farm honor, my hunter that I was planning to mostly play is stuck at 40 since I got zero motivation to try leveling before the shitstorm settles.
---
You and me both friend. Parking your character in a dungeon to grind 10 levels is not a fun way to play.
---
0 gPvP and no innovation vs 2006 video :(
---
😁
---
I know people are all #nochanges. But I really don’t see why they don’t just do this. It’s an exploit and mobs with knockbocks do exist. Just put knockbacking bird mobs on the roof.
---
In my experience so far, Fire mages are way worse on threat, at least single target. They’ll rip a primary target right off me with a string of lucky crits. Frost Mages just spam Blizzard and honestly don’t give me much trouble provided I’ve already got consec down and Holy shield up. But that’s just me.
---
I think the hope is that Blizzard catches wind of the outcry. In that regard, I haven't seen nearly enough of it.
---
That sounds like something that a friend would tell you and youd not question it since its kinda logical.
---
I believed that farming gold was hard.
---
And I fucking told you that this wont work lol.
---
I know my class and I know the gear that exists. You expect shamans to tank in cloth or what?
---
I have unsuscribed currently. Part of it is lack of time, but also the cruel fate that awaits me when I actually have time to play. I usually give it a couple of corpseruns before leaving for another game.
---
This is normal Private Server behavior.
---
I played in Kronos, Northdale, Light's Hope and Feenix. What's happening is standard.
---
I tried to warn ppl about what will happen to the PvP servers come P2 and Blizzard deleted my forum thread and gave me a FOUR MONTH forum ban.
---
Gee i wonder why that is
---
A noob like you would be surprised, but keep theorycrafting on reddit xD. 1400 boi
---
Nothing you do will make me log o to my *protection warrior* to try and fight you.
---
For protection warriors
---
If you didn't want to wpvp 24/7 why did you join a pvp server?
---
This is not a big deal at all and I don’t want to come across as antagonistic, but I’m always bothered by this. To me LFM has always had the explicit implication that the group already has 2+ in it. This probably has something to do with the fact that LFM is most commonly used in that way. 
---
There, I said my peace, downvote away.
---
This is one of those things id love to be able to do. But not really. I mean. I would want to make my mage into an undead. But i know that if they allowed us to do so, so many would do it and it would fuck up the game.
---
also found this about Shaman tanking https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05snKc32nbE
---
QQ more. This is the game. If you can’t handle it find a RP server or uninstall.
---
That is exacty what happened
---
No it's more like "You don't like living in your neighborhood? Just drop everything you own (you can't sell or trade it), and start up somewhere else with no money or belongings!"
---
You can go fuck yourself with that "go pve" bullshit that you guys keep spewing. That shit doesn't help anyone you cunt.  There's genuine problems with the game but idiots like you wave it off like "pVp Is HaPpEnInG oN a PvP sErVeR"
---
Haha, Blizzard actually got people with "we have all the kills recorded".
---
Honor doesn't mean anything. It is the RP you get by what percentile of honor you gained in that week. 2 weeks have already been processed. Sure, **honor will pop up back on your page but the lost RP from the first 2 weeks is gone.** the weeks have already been processed and they arent going to reprocess them cause many people will lose RP and cause a shitstorm.
---
It's a lot less funny knowing you're posting things of yourself.
---
No one is crying that pvp isn't "in their favor", however this isn't pvp how it was in vanilla, this is just war crimes and extermination of a source of honor points.
---
Could you theoretically use mind control to get them a dishonorable kill?
---
I gave up going to UBRS right before P2 launched. Had a group of about 20 organized horde who would stun lock you on the chain while one of the many priests would MC you off the chain into the lava. UBRS was completely off limits to alliance.
---
I died 9 times getting to ubrs from thorium point today, took an hour from forming the group until we all got in.
---
An addon that is literally a requirement for all classes in PVP should not be allowed. Especially because the only reason it is a requirement is because everyone is using it.
---
BUT YOU ROLLED ON PVP SO THIS IS WHAT U WANTED
---
No idea but it's a damn shame.
---
&gt; Talents and gear please!!
---
someone did a write about melee hunter stuff on Barrens.chat it's for pve but im sure it shares similarities.
---
Is the title a Scooter reference?
---
Well, since I can't do anything in the world other than grind dungeons and Blizzard won't let me transfer from a PvP to a PvE server, I don't feel like I have much choice. Don't feel like rerolling my character that I sunk like 10 days played in, rather just play something else.
---
Def raid logging more. Wpvp is shit because it's just 5-20 man gank squads corpse camping solo players.
---
Balance really should be maintained somehow.
---
Also, hunters can talent for a longer range than anyone else, perhaps you can snipe them off.
---
Dungeons
---
I'd reopen transfers for underdog factions since I doubt I could fix anything. Then I'd transfer away.
---
One-way transfers to the opposite faction on specific realms? (Like, Horde &gt; Alliance) Sure, why not.
---
If you are on a PVP server, you need to install spy. Nearly everyone on the opposite faction has it, so you are at a huge disadvantage in world PVP.
---
I didn't put PvP in it because I saved it for Phase 2 video.
---
You chose the wrong faction.
---
even 60/40 mean that one side is 50% more numerous than the other
---
Almost every single pvp server is dominated by horde.
---
Let's stop pretending faction specific migrations would help, there is no where for them to go where they wouldn't be the dominant faction. Unless you offer pvp to pve transfers where alliance are actually favoured.
---
These actions:
---
Rooftop camping
---
Camping honourless target, including res sickness people on the way to a dungeon.
---
Boat / zepplin camping 
---
City raids to kill players.
---
Are actively making people quit. My guild Is alliance before p2 I had 60 active members. Now I have 10 active members and another 30 which raid log.
---
We cannot get out of an inn without dying to a mage on the roof.
---
We can't get into dungeons at all sometimes. (Cheap shot into gnomish mindcontrol cap ran away.) 
---
We cant get on the boats most of the time, nevermind use one.
---
We cant get use the auction house in stormwind or ironforge because they're dead. And you are too if you go inside.
---
Just stop doing this, kill someone once and move on, stop griefing its killing your servers.
---
Player vs player, not 'honour grind' as a community, specifically as a horde player it is your duty to not kill the servers by partaking in these things.
---
Im glad I rolled on a PvE server. Its still nostalgic and fun =)
---
Warlock? Yes easy
---
and 80% of the realms are pvp
---
My word, that's 100% horde!
---
Epic mount
---
. Same
---
&gt; The vast majority of my friends (who are to be fair, casual) haven't played or have severely reduced their play since P2 dropped. As for me, I had 2 60s in MC gear when P2 dropped and even I have severely reduced my playing time since P2. Basically only raiding now. And I'm on one of few even faction balance PVP servers (Incendius). Ideal world PVP to me is organized raids on quest hubs/towns or world-encounter 1v1s (or 1v2/2v2s) that happen organically while you're both out questing/farming.
---
This speak to me on a spiritual level :)
---
Because these servers are over populated.
---
If they weren't, it wouldn't be anywhere as egregious as it is now.
---
i think there's a pretty big consensus that mop was one of the best expansions ever
---
Vanish ✓
---
Detect greenskins ✓
---
You totally missed the point of why people are upset about those who camp brm. I dont care about the actual players and i certainly dont get salty and think that they think they are pvp gods. I know and they know that skill doesnt matter when outnumbered like this. 
---
Im upset because i cant join in on the fun myself and im upset because it takes me 30 to 45m to get from either morgans vigil or thorium point to get to the instances. But thats not the worst part. The worst part is that its really difficult to get a group from those instances now because people dont want to do them and a noticeable amount of people only raidlog now because of it.
---
I stopped using imp fd some time ago and just run tribute with my 20/31/0 raid spec.
---
As long as you fd out of los it works out fine and even with resists you can most of the time salvage the situation (reset spots, resummon pet to lead the mobs away). It's useful to run a wolf for this as you can pull aggro off of you with howl.
---
Once in a while you just die, but that happened to me with imp fd also. Actually I would say that I'm more consistent now, because I'm not as cocky with my fds when I don't have imp fd.
---
LMAO this logic
---
Lol, if servers stats had been publicized on servers, people would just pick the advantaged population.
---
And if blizzard had tried to force faction balance, the #NOCHANGE crowd would have cried like babies
---
Yes the fuck it was. Idk why people keep spreading this bullshit. All we did was grief each other in vanilla. The only difference is there wasn’t massive swamps of thousands of people doing it.
---
This would work
---
No its not.
---
LoOkS sOmEonE gOt PvPd oN pVp sErVEr LuLlLxdXD gO bAcK tO ReTaiL
---
its not our fault blizzard was idiotic enough to give us shamans ugly blue color, give it to the nasty shitty paladins
---
You are literally contradicting yourself to the point of not being even remotely coherent; you're saying you shouldn't reserve stuff and then that you should reserve stuff.
---
Get the hell out of here. Try to hold one coherent argument and talk to be after.
---
Fire mages are just frost mages but when they pull aggro the mobs sprint at 100% speed instead of being slowed.
---
Thinking you deserve more than others; that's the definition of entitlement.
---
This is hilarious and I could see it really confusing people.
---
I thought raiding guilds always distributed loot 1 person at a time (1 tank full t1, 1 tank greens, 1 mage t1, 1 mage greens) for setbonusses, also that everyone needed fire resistance gear (mage full fire ress prio over spelldmg).
---
Now that im actually doing the raids i hate that the setbonusses are bad and blues are better in many slots.
---
Do you know what the current population cap is?
---
Hundreds of hours? To get to 60?
---
Leave the guild. Why even be in a shit guild that still has to pug and then reserves loot for other people but not you? Find yourself a real guild.
---
The players killed pvp servers. None of those would happened if horde players didn't act like a dick and said "lol go reroll on pve server/retail" to people pointing the problem.
---
Log out, get rested exp ready for when BGs release in little over a week. Level an alt to 35 for transmute professions.
---
Hopefully the suspend the warriors I see slapping people through he gadgetzan inn roof
---
Then some players would leave in phase 3, some in phase 4 and by AQ20 there would be exactly 20 ppl left to raid with the rest of semi geared PUGs trying to catch on you core in BWL and ZG.
---
Try sorting things out with your currient GM before splitting first.
---
The “unplayable experience” is the reason I did not roll on a PVP server. 
---
I know it doesn’t help you much...
---
Report them and play something else while you wait.
---
what about decimal transfers?
---
It's the application of those buffs that would send a 1 time message to the combat log.
---
bc you usually cant transfer PvP to PvE. Makes no sense, but blizzard seem to think it does. And i certainly understand why he wouldnt want to level again to 60
---
&gt;	You board them inside Horde territory.
---
Only one zeppelin is guarded, stv, both brill and orgrimmar zeppelin can be boarded without aggroing guards.
---
Similar to the boats in menethil, theramore, darkshore etc.
---
&gt;	Also literally fuck yourself with your ”PvE” server shit. Remember Phase 1 when you could actually use boats and flight masters were alive? Blow me, Horde flair.
---
Yikes, calm down, no need to call names just because you disagree.
---
The simple fact is that traveling is dangerous, always has been. And if you choose to play on a PvP server you accept those dangers.
---
Now, I will agree that currently the servers are overpopulated which makes this a much more serious problem. But I do not think that the solution is to add guards everywhere.
---
They just shrunk the combat logging to 100m. So basically you cannot find someone on spy that is outside of your targeting range.
---
Damn, people are sensitive these days.
---
University? So you were 5 years old when you played vanilla? Ok
---
Ahh good to see that the Duskwood PD has some new recruits.
---
I run the same spec pretty much, but with 4 pts in wing clip instead of parry and raptor strike boost. Those 4 points are pretty much free picks though, many variants work fine.
---
Everyone saying about buffing guards and adding new guards and stuff. Disagree on the "no changes" principle. Really i think they just need to bring out BGs asap. Currently world PvP is the only way people can pvp. Once BGs are out this kind of stuff will be much rarer.
---
How u gonna transfer a shaman into a paladin tho?
---
Blow it off in a ZG/AQ20 GDKP group? It's the kind of group organized by well geared tanks and healers to make money. Loot is auctioned off the highest bidder, and at the end of the raid, the organizer takes some fee and the rest of the money will be divvied up to everyone.
---
Get a better pc lmao
---
The earth was round
---
Horde was camping on gadgetzan roof last night and I reported and nothing
---
Source on 90 percent? Also, onslaught does not use LC. LC is not "strictly" better. We had a mage get first mageblade despite him being 20th on DPS missing half pre bis 3 months in. Go figure. Guess what ? He was an officer.
---
They aren't #nochanges simply to please a crowd, it's because it's free for them. We won't ever see any changes  in the game, unless its really minor.  They even reduced GM/support intervention as much as possible.
---
Reported for a name? You sound like an overly sensitive bitch lol.
---
.
---
Good catch I didn’t even see it
---
You should inform whether or not your budget includes the need to buy a monitor and peripherals.
---
But what was the real reason they gave you a 4 month ban?
---
huge vanilla no lifer here. raids bore the shit out of me and i only join them to help out my friends
---
took me 8-10 kills. however the aged gorilla sinew was a solid hour and a half of mob grinding.
---
Or report them for using exploits. In fact, mass report them - automation will kick in and they will get a temp ban. PvP on a PvP realm afterall.
---
I got no clue why you are being downvoted by simply telling people the logic of the campers
---
its true that prot is slower in a lot of the solo farmable content, but is still possible, also fishing and other professions are a real money maker, and the fact that they're class independent is what makes them good options for prot warriors
---
I’m a Herod horde player and 100% would swap. I would even pay for a faction change
---
Why not go to sw and call for lvl 60 help? You guys are playing a mmo not hello kitty?
---
Fuck off troll
---
That there would always be something to do :\
---
I‘m just glad playing on a pve server
---
Just read my message again
---
I meant in looks.
---
Much respect for the effort you're putting in. Are you able to do Whitemane Horde or Alliance? I tried but I get some error about 'the .info blah blah cannot upload your .lua file'. This server's numbers are amongst the least accurate and most in need.
---
I'm sure someone will be able to point out why this is dumb, but why can't they just split the available slots on a server 50:50 horde to alliance?
---
If the server was heavily skewed to one faction or the other, then the more popular faction would get bigger queues. 
---
This would balance out the amount of players for both factions in game, and give an incentive to faction change and avoid queues.
---
There's be some initial pain, but it would result in the eventual balance of factions wouldn't it?
---
Yep lol 
---
Theyre the same people sitting on the roof camping lowbies
---
good guilds will make sure the main tank is fully geared first priority, and the rest of the loot is distributed evenly
---
Source?
---
You think it's only something horde players do? You're beyond stupid! Hahaha
---
Why would anyone camp the graveyard in BG's, your honor farm is infinitely more efficient by just winning quickly. You know that players are only worth honor 4 times in a 24 hour period before they are decayed to 0 honor, so again, what would be the point of camping a graveyard.
---
Also this is post-nerf AV, the games are 4 minutes long, the bracket 1 players will be grinding AV.
---
If you think Leaf/Eye shouldn't be reserved for guildies, you are a goof.
---
If you don't have a full guild raid group, your raid group is bad.
---
If you have more than 1-2 hunters/priests that still need one, your guild is bad.
---
Just an unfortunate situation for an unfortunate group of people IMO.
---
Worse racials
---
1k bonus?? Hell no, gtfo
---
\&gt;I want to point out that these population websites are just showing the results of people uploading their census addon data, and are wildly skewed. 
---
Download an addon, upload your own data. 
---
\&gt;but then Blizzard broke the addon and everyone stopped using it 
---
Blizzard broken ClassicLFG, census was a collateral damage. The /who scan was moved to manual function.
---
\&gt;So stop taking these websites as gospel truth.  
---
This is as close as you get to the accurate data though. The more people run it, the more accurate it is. The issue is the other source is "DuDe TrUsT mE" anecdotal evidence — that's more of a problem and comments here prove it hard.
---
Its not againt TOS to stand on that roof, and everybody agreed to No chances so they wont fix imbalances there were in the game , wait for bgs and pray that IT Gets better OR switch to a PVE server if you cant stand getting ganked
---
Nobody is stopping people from playing on PVE servers
---
Yea I dont get it when ppl complain about getting ganked etc in chats not only by this example but in general and the htought of findin other sto group up to quest with or gank the mback never comes up.  
---
the thing is just that XP playes quests and farming will have hordes and its kinda ur duty to kill or justh elp kill hordes wh o are questing or taking ur factions farm loot.  
---
atleast layoring fuckers are pretty muc gone who lleft here brothers in a dangerous layer to void pvp  
---
thats whati hate about retailers.
---
Crazy how 57 seconds are enough to turn your life around
---
Cataclysm was a great expansion ruined by a single (admittedly massive) bad decision in the form of the permanent global forced world changes. Beyond that, it was probably the single best expansion up to that point, and it would have been nearly perfect had the world changes been quest-triggered instead of automatic. Pandaria was polarizing because of its particular aesthetic, but overall it was a decent expansion for those who don't take one look at it and go off on a rant about "aSiA bAd ReEeEeEe". Can't really comment on WoD since I quit retail before it came out, but it seems bland at worst from what little I know of it. 
---
BFA, from everything I've seen as an outsider, seems well-intentioned but horribly executed. At best it looks boring and uninspired, bringing very little new to the game and replacing a lot of good things with mediocre or outright bad ones. While I can't comment from personal experience with it, I could certainly see why it might be the worst expansion *in their opinion*. And at the end of the day, that's all it is - opinion and personal preference.
---
You can't improve your fucking skills when you're being viper stinged by a hunter 9 miles away on a roof, and when you retaliate the guards fuck you up instead.
---
You definitely are a roof camper if you're trying this hard to justify or defend it.
---
There is a Autodismount addon. It Discounts you when you want to cast or loot something whilenmounted. Your have to press the cast twice though. First one trufgers dismount. So There is a littlendelay on the cast.
---
People camp graveyards right now, they kill people with rez sickness. What makes you think that the winning faction won't camp BG gy?
---
&gt; I remember them well enough and rolled PVE this time and it's been so much fun.
---
The point is, that this time around it's MUCH worse. I liked the PvP how it was in Vanilla. It was challenging and fun. It made for stories and rivalries to remember. Sometimes you get ganked by a no life ?? asshole but all in all it was playable.
---
Today? It's an absolute shit show. Especially when you hit 48. The gankers don't even know or care about the reduced honor from repeatable kills and keep killing you after 4 kills which gives them nothing at all.
---
No changes :D
---
That’s embarrassing to be acting like a child and claiming your a dad
---
I only left my server and went to a different one
---
They would obviously have to lock Paladins/Shamans from changing. 
---
Sure its not ideal. But it wouldnt affect the gameplay in any way so the #Nochanges crowd cant cry about it.
---
&gt;don't say balance is fine, it is absolutely not. 
---
When people say it's fine, they mean "this is how it was expected to be".
---
 So everyone should have rolled a Rogue in a PvP server? I know it's an option, but at this stage it almost seems more of a "must" :/
---
And let's be real here, will you actually wait a month to play a game which had so much hype and having the first-mover advantage in almost every aspect, just to see if the PvP server would be as shit as it is now?
---
why dont the guards just have rpgs wtf
---
I mean I reported kiddiddlerxd but I guess joking about molesting kids is funny.
---
Out of curiosity, which private server died because of that? I played horde on LH, quiet a few people I knew were quitting because you couldn't do anything.
---
Yes! More wowclassic high quality shitposts!
---
Dude, alliance is happily playing on PVE servers though, since most of them rolled there from the very beginning, being very well aware what expects them on PVP servers.
---
How you going to transfer 1/2 into 3/4?
---
One could question as to why that may be. Perhaps because Alliance are no longer running census because they're not logged in to do so? *X-Files music plays in the distance*
---
Pray for faction changes (I’d pay at this point) to go from Herod horde to alliance. If those get shut down as never happening then probably reroll to a PvE server and play alliance and get bored by the time I’m 30 and quit the game.
---
Maby he mentioned Private servers which is against official forum rules
---
Well yes and yes I have. Doing that since Classic release. And no it doesn't mean I am entitled to anything.
---
Leaders are servants to others, not kings.
---
If there are pugs, they should be allowed to roll. They put in just as much effort as the hunter. You don't want pugs, recruit more people and do a full guild run.
---
I've militarized my guild's farming on Bigglesworth. We farm in brute-squads, and we go to a zone, and take it over, hard. And we leave as a group.  
---
Horde outnumbers us 2 to 1 on our server, but we fight the good fight, and I'd say we win more than our fair share ... but you pretty much gotta run your shit like a military operation. A lot of us are vets in my guild. Instead of going into the Diremaul entrance, we usually use the side DM: E entrance, north of the horde base, etc.. Blackrock Mountain is always a nightmare though. You can't get in there without dying 3 times, unless you bring a raid -- so we do.  
---
And we do like 3 BRD's at one time.  
---
A lot of us are vets, IRL ... but -- a lot of the non-military guild members are kind of losing hope, and we've had a few G-quits, and a few people leave the server because they can't handle it. Unfortunately, things aren't much better on the server some people transferred to either.
---
If i am DS/Ruin i put the 2 filler points in to Suppression.
---
Also what people not realize is the reason blizz quadrupled their max server cap size is to reach a healthy player count per server. In a way its layering but without layers but counting on quitting players.
---
Allys keep complaining but it's literally the way the game is designed
---
What's the difference between a boomkin with world buffs and a boomkin without world buffs?
---
Choosing to play on a PvP server and complaining about PvP .... 
---
Leveling 1-60 while getting ganked running from graveyard every 15 minutes was extremely frustrating. I myself contemplated re-rolling on a PVE server so I wouldn’t have to deal with it. 
---
PvP gives the servers life, helps boost the economy, promotes comradery among other players.
---
Please re roll on a PvE server and don’t ruin it for the rest of us.
---
Rocket launcher stops ya
---
This is all assuming the rogue in question is not undead...
---
PVE servers have the same faction inbalance issues as PVP but it’s alliance that outnumber the horde. Asking for a character transfer from PVP Servers to PVE servers you are just making the issue worse for both types of servers.
---
fear is....basically useless? what? you mean for warlocks? what are you even talking about lol fear is like half the reason were so good at pvp. most classes don't have a good answer to it.
---
you're squishy for any number of reasons but it doesn't have to be that way. bad spec, bad gear/pvp gear, not having VW out if you are a squishy spec to sac, not having a healthstone ready at all times, not having LIPs to use, I mean the list goes on
---
and i've never had someone break my fear with skull, not once, and i pvp a LOT. you're talking like it happens every time just about. no idea where you're getting that from lol it just sounds like you don't know pvp matchups or something
---
Well that seems like a completely fair and reasonable thing to do
---
the leaf is the last thing your guild should be reserving. its not rate at all and sooner rather than later he will get his drop.
---
just like benediction it is a very good item for mc loot, but in the end its nothing special at all since it drops so often. there are lots of items ahead of that stupid bow that should be reserved.
---
When I first started playing, I believed that once my gear is all red, my character would be invalid.
---
I think I deleted 3-4 level 11-14 characters because all my gear was red and I didn't know how to fix it.....
---
&gt; Almost every single pvp server is dominated by horde.
---
that is so not true.
---
I'm based on EU, so I can't run the census on US. Don't upload anything, just run a census on a Tuesday night, that's the most accurate timeslot for an overall faction balance split, as you'll be catching all the raid loggers from both sides. Find someone from the opposite faction to run it at the same time.
---
In 20 minutes you will have a very good picture on how the server stands at that particular time.
---
me
---
Once BGs come out world pvp should die down quite a bit it will be fine
---
does feline swiftness movement bonus speed stack with druid's pvp set bonus? and why basic pvp wsg druid build spend only 1 point into FS talent instead of two? also how speed enchants interact with cat or travel forms? .. thanks
---
Legit every person below who commented something along the lines of "roll pve server, PvP on PvP server" has either horde flair or doesn't have one...
---
Listen, there is major fundamental differences between this and vanilla - no one could have anticipated this
---
1. Servers are larger there's more people per server than before.
---
2. The game now is completely different - no one is still farming FR gear because negative FR doesn't exist here. Otherwise everyone would be farming that for MC. Since it don't exist, MC gets cleared very quickly (most guilds down in phase 1) meaning there's more downtime to PVP.
---
3. BGs were released in vanilla at the perfect crossroads of PvE progression and needing something more to do.
---
4. No one is "learning" everyone knows what they need to do, when they need to do it - so you know you gotta level up goblin engineering for sappers...that prob took you months to learn how strong it was in vanilla.
---
5. PvP focused players 100% know that horde Racials are better - it's why nearly every server was unbalanced.
---
Yo I'm sorry, but I can't even be in Ironforge in the Auction house without getting 100-0'd by a rogue as a 4.5k HP soul-link warlock...theres 0 counterplay to being stunlocked, trinket doesn't work on rogue stuns.
---
End of the day they should've released BG's with honor and I don't think anyone could convince me otherwise.
---
Either reroll horde or to a non pvp server
---
Assuming you're talking about demonic runes (the only BoP thing): you can also get them from satyr trash in DM E. You don't have to be able to solo them if you can get a group of guildies willing to help you.
---
Slow, tremor, ground their spells, heal to full, actually just two shot someone, is quite tanky with mail armor. They're a good class.
---
They attack from the roof so guards/melee can't attack them
---
Give guards ranged weapons. They should normally charge you, but if you are in an unreachable spot they take out their bows and shoot you.
---
The acts in question aren't a problem as long as they happen in moderation.
---
Getting ganked by a 4 man group maybe once or twice an hour? Annoying but doesn't take away to much of the fun. But every 5 minutes in a frequency where you have the 2 min res timer up all the time? That isn't fun at all.
---
how do rogues sit in BRD and pickpocket farm for hours on end? it's so goddamn boring and i feel like it doesn't even net that much gold in the end, even with killing certain bosses. there has to be a better place for rogues to make gold?
---
Might have something to do with playing on the designated reddit boomer carebear server.
---
&gt; except for Cobrak
---
Has he come back to Classic?  I havent seen him stream or any vids on youtube lately and ive been checking.
---
Also 100% agree on destro.   Many players get surprised by the 100-0 in a seduce when you all crit.  
---
Been destro in retail since vanilla and its always been my go to spec. :)
---
Being attacked from the roof in Darkshire is not a bannable offense unfortunately
---
Thats how it is; and never understood the lfg ppl; if i form group(which is almost always) i never invite ppl from lfg; i wiat for wisps
---
TLDR ITR; I rolled a toon on a PVP server and now I'm bitching about it.
---
So there being 5000 people stops blizzard from banning a few? Ok
---
^
---
Down ranking for leveling? Are you fucking high?
---
It is till 48
---
as makes sense. the rag weapons are an actual rare drop and not some shit that drops every 2nd run. rhok is nothing special at all, a rag 2h is.
---
Have you tried... Duels? Hahaha
---
I'd give prio to a hunter with the sinew, but pugs deserve to also roll on unreserved items.
---
I live in Japan and re-rolled on Grobbulus a few weeks ago. I might not ever be in during their prime time, but I have still been able to get groups just fine up to 40. Might want to at least check it out on a low or and see what the population is like during your normal play time.
---
&gt;2. Just put in effort for nothing? litterally nothing?
---
I mean, personally I do raids partially for the fun of it, being part of this big group and killing all these powerful enemies designed for said big group. The potential for loot is an added thrill, but you have to understand that in classic, spreading 3-4 items per boss over 30-40 people means you won't always get an item for your efforts.
---
Just get the frost saber

Nowhere did I attempt to justify or defend roof camping... Stating an opinion (once) equates to "trying this hard" If Blizz truly took issue and never intended for these terrain glitches to be used something as simple as making the rooftops, cages, etc. impassable terrain would have prevented any further issue. I believe the devs knew full well they'd be exploited and left them in. There are multiple fixes they could've implemented (restricting access, giving guards charge/ranged attack, adding damage effects to these areas, etc.) and choose not to. IMO it was a non-issue until enough people QQ and that's why they made it a reportable offense.   
---
One might consider reporting the offender, avoiding the area for 60-90 minutes until they've been booted by a GM improving your skills. Especially if you're of the mentality that your quest NEEDS to be turned in at that very moment even if it means getting face rocked by a bored, PvP challenged basement dweller. Then getting mad that the game didn't prevent this from happening when you could've simply slaughtered some NPC's or completed other quests instead of charging into a higher level enemy in an area he's not being attacked. I'd consider that improving your skills.
---
&gt; Roof ganking is considered an exploit
---
I can’t speak to every class, but on my Druid it got a lot easier to continue gearing up when I dropped a healthy chunk of gold on a 5/6 buyable pre-raid best or second best in slots.
---
Ill try to answer everyone here. At the moment im sitting with 6/8 giantstalker and dragon stalker leggins+ 2 tarnished elven rings. 
---
This makes 1%hit from legs+2% from rings +1% shoulders+2%gloves= 6% hit.
---
Another hunter in my guild also is on the 6% hit cap and his dps is awesome, so i wasnt really sure who do believe, my hunter guildie or other people saying i should reach 9%. 
---
So, just for knowing ive understood it: I dont need more than the 6% i already have, and putting bizznicks on is a waste of dps?
---
Thanks again in advance!
---
Probably, considering I work in construction 8 hours a day. I play maybe an hour or so per day.
---
Plus a lot of classes can drop a chunk of gold at 60 and get a sweet jump in power level
---
You can swap out hit / spell power pieces according to your job. A good example is banish duty in raids, where hit rating helps more than spell power. For anything outside raids, get rid of the hit pieces.
---
Dare I say, it isn't funny *at all.*
---
Legit had to do a double take on what sub this was posted on, this could just as easily be r/polyamory or something.
---
Old man yells at cloud.
---
That's the tragic thing. This way of getting honor sounds like the most boring farm ever. And that's saying something when talking about WoW. Especially since this time around you aren't only having a bad time yourself but you also make sure other players have just as a bad time.
---
Yeah TBC gave Horde paladins - the only reason faction was stronger in PvE in Vanilla. Also it started buffing Orc and Troll racials. Considering currient retail situation and WoW Classic PvP server disbalance wPvP would be dead if TBC comes out, on 5 Horde per 1 Alliance dominated "PvP" 95:5 (dead alts) servers.
---
I am still going to play Draenai, but only on PvE realm.
---
I hate also doing the pickpocket in brd. Insanly boring, but it is alright gold per hour. I think i get like 35-40g per hour. I switched from that to picking herbs. Feel like i get more gold from herbs and making mongoose potion. But not much more. And it is really random if i get herbs or not. Sometimes there are alot people pickibg herbs and sometimesbi get ganked by alliance
---
you cant compare having a single friend to do a dungeon with, to getting r14 which will require an insane time dedication. 
---
im saying that farming gold, for any class or spec is not hard. thats just simply true.
---
Uninstall game.
---
Grounding Totem eats the stun from Charge.
---
So they get to you, you don't stop, and you've gotten clear with Frost Shock / Earthbind before they can Hamstring you.
---
Isn’t grieving against the rules? There was a post a few days with a GM telling horde to stop roof camping or they’d receive a ban.
---
Lol no imp blizz sry
---
Source? 
---
Plenty of horde play their race because they like the race. Just like you picked your race because you like your race. I've played an undead rogue since vanilla, and an orc shaman since vanilla. They're both the best looking race for their class IMO, the gear looks the best on them, again, IMO. 
---
It's so backwards to me how this subreddit paints this picture that every horde player is a dumb asshole tryhard and every alliance is a good guy just trying to have fun. There are assholes on both sides. The bias on this subreddit is childish and irrational.
---
wew what a story lol
---
this is kinda shitty logic overall though. sure, less warlocks on alliance because of wotf. i get that. but shaman grounding totem? if that is what you are referencing then it is as simple as casting a corruption, rank 1 even, fear shammy, wand totem. sure, easier said than done in a big wpvp situation but horde warlocks have something similar to deal with in fear ward. and don't even get me started on paladins in pvp.
---
According to my GM it will be a shitshow.
---
This is where your alt comes in handy
---
In tbc dailies didn't bring anything but money and some rep that was far from mandatory. While nowadays if you want to gear up efc it seems like you HAVE to do these world quests that boost your necklace thingy level and give you starting gear etc.
---
No i dont wanna tank ST damnit stop whispering me
---
Let's meet on Wednesday and confirm this? Are you Horde or Alliance?
---
we dont use dkp, so when/if blade drops there will be like 10 rollers and highest one will get it.
---
Yeah it did - I was around level 50 when the vanilla honour system launched and it was a huge shitshow.  There was still flight point camping and shit like that - especially in places like gadgetzan.  There were pretty much always alliance rogues camping the grom gol zeppa etc.  I remember trying to level in wpl and getting chain ganked by 60s.
---
People who think this didn’t happen in vanilla are sorely mistaken.  There were huge whine posts on the official forums complaining about being unable to level now etc - the exact same shit as today.
---
Blizzard should never have launched honour this time around with no bgs.  People were saying this before classic launch even but a lot on this sub circle jerked about epic garden mill south shore fights which was never going to return in the same way.
---
Don’t forget the original phase plan from blizz had honour system and bgs at the same phase.  It was feedback from idiots on this sub and other public forums that caused them to change it.
---
Did the shaman need carapace? feelsbadman
---
he is talking about pvp servers in general, not the super high population servers
---
Herbs ingredients for flasks.
---
Download an add-on and buy any herb posted at less than 80% of the market value. Keep them all (make a bank alt or two and fill their banks with herbs).
---
People tryhard in MC even though it's ezmode content. Once BWL releases and people realize that it's a tougher dungeon, a lot of people will be needing flasks to progress.
---
The spike in demand should ideally be met with a sharp increase in prices. And you'd be able to sell what you bought at 80% for 150% easily.
---
The item is raid lootable iirc but since every guild will be there it will be crazy anyway
---
guards are unable to path to the roofs of buildings. If a higher level ranged class gets on a roof in an opposing faction town they can kill all the players from the roof and be untouchable by the guards
---
Yup
---
Because thats what it always is. Other guy nub.
---
Modt people tank as warrior or druid. Paladins are actually better at keeping threat over an area, and thats especially apparant when people use aoe at the start of a pull.
---
Holy shit you guys are mental. If you can‘t agree just make your own damn pugs and find out how painful it actually is to manage one. 
---
Also what about the other classes, that need stuff but also gets their items rolled on? If the guild needs hunters and is accepting puggers then you should also take the double edged sword and allow them to roll on stuff they need. These puggers are not there to slave for you. Neither the guild master that organises a functional raid. Stop being so narrcistic and delusional. If OP would be a good member, he would try to convince low level hunters or hunters without a guild in general to join your guild. But instead go and whine about it on reddit gj, solves all the problems.
---
Also the the dragon sinew will drop eventually, since it has 30% chance whereas the pvp sword only has 5%. It is challenging to reserve such a mid tier important item. So what about the mage blade? Or rogue set? Or the warlock gear? Don‘t they deserve it too? I mean it will eventually be your turn just ask nicely and stop whining around in sub forums instead of talking it out with your gm. 
---
Btw /u/Mightymorp boy nice advice from /r/relationship , just make an ultimatum and if he doesn‘t accept just cancel everything. Crawl back where you from spastic boy. This game is full with insecured people that makes thinks this behaivour is acceptable. Smh
---
I mean you clearly have reading comprehension issues if that’s your takeaway.
---
The guild should switch to loot council, if it hasn't already, and start recruiting hunters. Once the leaf drops, give it to the hunter who has been waiting for it the longest (i.e.: the hunter we're talking about).
---
you aren't wrong, but not all warlock specs can drain life in pvp especially vs melee classes. you need fel conc to get the 70% reduced chance to have your drains interrupted, which not all builds get/have. it is actually difficult to pvp vs a decent warrior if you don't have fel conc since you can't sit there and just heal most of his damage back and you can't fear him to negate that damage. 
---
i only mention it because not all warlocks can do this, all the time. the overall "best" pvp spec does have fel conc though.
---
I agree, im level 28.
---
Same, though I'm not even sure why. I love its aesthetics and such, I just find it *so boring* in Classic. Plus, its competing with the Barrens :P
---
In what world does your fury prot MT not get onslaught girdle first?
---
Actually yeah I was quite young, the youngest memory of the game that I have is TBC when I was 7. I made a blood elf hunter named “supercat”. I don’t think that that makes my opinion any less valid.
---
Woah, calm down there chief.
---

Who plays with voice on lol

*that, sucks your dick for you

&gt;  it was 65% horde 35% horde.
---
\#nochanges

Guess what those players while do while waiting in queue due to unbalanced servers? Exactly, go out and do the same shit they do now. So at best you can subtract those players who will be in an active BG and those who are on the way to your zone from the cities where they queued or returned from the BG.
---
that is hilarious. i play undead and have never gotten a chance to do this, nor seen it. 
---
your end part about "they don't like to pvp, they like to grief" just sounds salty and is factually incorrect, however, if you maybe possibly tried to git gud and not get dunked on in pvp, your sentiments might change slightly. Best of luck to you out there, sounds like you need it!
---
&gt;downvote away.
---
If you insist
---
Just start the queue. Then you can go do whatever
---
My fucking eyes
---
I should add my dad plays, he’s the reason I was playing at such a young age. I remember him raiding karazhan and me asking every week for him to do the chess part because it was cool.
---
yikes, they're really downvoting you for this.
---
yeah the post is about that horde, as well as alliance, should report this, but still.
---
Well then Blizzard needs to find a solution lol. It’s not our job as paying customers to solve their issues.
---
What?
---
&gt; It'll be even more one sided cause the small few of alliance pvpers will get instant Queues and have no need to leave their major hubs.
---
OH FUCK. Didn't even think about that one. But I guess your prediction will be on the point.
---
Why its so common to see people mix Thoose 2 up
---
Whenever I spam 
---
"LFG (insert dungeon here) Healer" in chat someone whispers me with something like
---
"priest here inv"
---
And that happens every 2 days or so
---
Hopefully it dies down quickly but yes it will be absolutely awful to begin with.
---
Why you heff be mad?
---
&gt;yet they sit in the exact same spots killing the exact same people over and over again for no honor.
---
obviously this isn't true if they are doing it. the vast majority of people don't do it to get joy out of griefing people, they do what is best or they view as best for getting honor. they must be killing enough different people to be getting enough honor to warrant doing it.
---
Please don't mby free transfers to high horde pop server for horde players and vice versa, but enabling people to change from human to undead is a huge mistake.
---
It's not just horde doing this, its allies on other servers.
---
Um yes way more often, the +5 to axes is equivalent to 3% hit which makes a huge fucking difference when leveling.. 
---
I stick to axes while leveling for this reason, leveling my 2nd Orc Warrior atm - and with both my weapon progression looked like: Axe of Orgrimmar --&gt; Prospector's Axe --&gt; (BFD Ninja Sword) then WW Axe --&gt; Executioner's and from then on your looking at BiS gear.
---
It adds up quite quickly and nothing sucks more then waiting 3.5 seconds for a swing only to miss, then miss again. You will kill quicker, take less damage and waste less resources in general.
---
Menethil “guards” are level 20 fishermen lmao. I’m getting ganked by horde on the dock while 4 lvl 20 NPCs wail on him and can’t even take a 1/4 of his health. How, Blizzard?!
---
Ah yes, the Almighty Horde hive mind, where hundreds of thousands of players act in the same way and think the same stuff at all times.
---
It's not unfair, your guild leader is just selfish and dgaf about the hunter.
---
He could advertise that the leaf is reserved, but he simply doesn't care.
---
You're highly upset for no reason.
---
me wpvping now makes me toxic. oh boy that is golden. good lord, if you think this way don't play online multiplayer games, please. for your sanity and health.
---
and what was your original post?
---
curious about that language ;P
---
I'm just wondering why you get zero credit for debuffing a target. I mean if a rogue dots up a mage and a lock drops fear on the mage, the lock will get nothing if the mage dies even if under fear. Or interrupting a self heal that would have saved saved them. I was helping a group take out a pvp farm group and I was throwing debuffs around and they were dying off so fast I didnt get a chance to do any damage and didnt get any credit.
---
We have a little more than a week before battlegrounds come out.  This will get better.  This phase is dumb.
---
ok oomer
---
I don't understand how server populations are so one-sided on every server....
---
they literally said rooftop sitting IS not allowed
---
Drama queen much? The game is playable, you're just being a whiny little crybaby. Did you ever play in Vanilla? This happened constantly... Guess what, we still played. Suck it up, buttercup.
---
urge to kill rizing, im gonna get ur girl, go get more training, no honor killing u rat, ur a gorilla
---
See above.
---
I didn't use any bad language.
---
Heaven forbid anyone new joins the game and rolls pvp because they think the developers of a 15 year old game would have some sense and pvp would be fair and enjoyable. Everybody should have had your great all seeing vision before choosing the realm to play on.
---
I'm one of these people. Got full raid gear, mount and so on. There is no high lvl zone I can go to without dying at the flightmaster and being corspe camped, even in IF you log in to Horde sniping people. Unless I want to do the pvp grind (which unless you have a large group or raid) is impossible, what can I do? I can't transfer to another server either because they are either dead or have the exact same ratio. I want to play the game but it's like a large part of content is shut down.
---
That’s what citation needed was for, but ty for the info, might have to look this up more
---
I don’t deny this. I’m just pointing out how some shit won’t ever change.
---
Even if the mage single targets frostbolt automatically slows.
---
Why not just prevent all players from standing on the roof. Just make all surfaces that are roofs in major town slippery and fall off
---
The thing I hate the most is when people types LFG/LFM but they doesn't specify what they are/what they need in the group
---
I usually assume LFG's are DPS
---
And LFM's need all
---
But I still feel quite anxious about asking them
---
there is no solution other than having a 60 parked nearby
---
Didn't stop them that time, why would they suddenly decide to be honorable now?
---
Its just on the edge and probably unreasonable imho. You need about ten days of played time to get 60 and I doubt you will get an invite into a guild as a fresh lvl 60 so you need like another day or two to get all the preraid gear.
---
It is possible, but you should maximize your time.
---
False givens. Top kek.
---
You don't get DK's from low levels...
---
They're not. Camping on PvP realms is not an offence according to the terms of service. It's just a coincidence that you don't see them again or maybe you're just paranoid and think you are being targeted. If you can't handle getting ganked you should have rolled on a PVE realm.
---
if your group overpulls, there is nothing much to do, when group pulls too much and no one bothers to cc, then its obviously hard, almost any class has some kind of cc, i can duo frost mage half of scholo because of cc (no bosses obviously), 5 man is just for speed and safety in that dung
---
Basically ok boomer I guess
---
Fear Ward is a 30 sec cool down that only one race can cast. Never gonna get used in bg
---
This is what was supposed to happen.
---
Honor system was added in April 2005, and it would be 3 months before battlegrounds would be invented. 
---
We were being farmed like mobs. I would login each night after work, spend 2 hours in the graveyard, and then log out. We didn't know battlegrounds we're going to be a thing, and assumed this is how the game is now.
---
So we had to abandon our level 60 characters, start over on a PvE server, and became:
---
&gt; &lt;Honor System Refugees&gt;
---
This is the authentic vanilla experience. This is exactly what you signed up for. \#NoChanges
---
There's these things called PVE realms.
---
I get it now!  
---
ENGINEERING is the problem!
---
You can turn error speech off.
---
You can switch the factions.. it's the same for everyone. I'm on a horde controlled server (incendius) and the alliance are straight pigs to my lvl 48. 
---
Doing quests in the way top of azshara? alliance in a group ganking you over and over.
---
Just hearth to gadetzan to do Zf for the 10000th time? Alliance will murder you the second you leave those walls and 5 more times of the way.
---
Ungoro is impossible. Hinterlands elite quests are a joke. Ferelas a night elf hunter camps the bridge and kills you 6 times in a row.
---
The fact level 60s can gain honor from lvl 48s is disgusting. I don't care if it's changing the game from vanilla, but change it to 58 until BGs.
---
This is so annoying blizzard, please fix this.
---
Unfortunately that would stop guilds and groups of players from faction swapping because they would have to leave people behind.
---
Inaccurate, there is only 1 horde
---
It depresses me when tanks use whirlwind and thunderclap lol
---
I would buy all the black lotuses and transmute ud to water formulas I can find.
---
The fuck is wrong with the droprate of Cape of the Black Baron? 50 runs down and the first time I saw it drop (of course I lost it). FUUUUUUUUUCK
---
if i invest gold into pvp fight, i see it as my lost instantly, i farm gold for other purposes and need tons of it, but yes sheeping is prolly the best option, generally i get jumped instantly so i barely have time to respond (wpvp)
---
The transfers are def what pushed it frkm acceptable imbalance to "holy shit this is fucked"
---
Ashbringer PvP has more Alliance players.
---
I thought attacking in town from a place unreachable by guards was a bannable offence since it was abusing game mechanics , it is not ?
---
I play on ashbringer feels pretty good. And only Que times at 18-20
---
You mean 5 kills?
---
thanks for that . so i should enchant stamina to boots in pvp?
---
What really cracks me up about this? You managed to break that much gear at that level.
---
But you aren´t comparing it to how it was, your point of comparison is their classic release plan.
---
There will be people who will say the same about getting R14, it's relative.
---
I had the similar conversation when I said I went classic to play casual instead of semi-hardcore playstyle of retail before I quit in 2014 by being burned out, but people here called me hardcore because of my 33 days /played.
---
I really need a help here guys. Does anyone run mining and herbalism on the same character? Lately I was thinking about getting both of these profs on my mage. I know about that its tricky with "find minerals/herbs" ability, but maybe one of you works around it with some addond or smth. I should also point out that Im a little altoholic so Im just trying to plan out now all other profs I get on my alts.
---
Thanks for any help, cheers!
---
It will be a shit show for the first week. Especially on pvp servers allies won't get the attunement in the early days.
---
So remember when classic first came out and we were all lining up in a cave to kill like one quest yeti or some shit. Now imagine the honeymoon being over and everyone trying to get their guild attuned to bwl. And imagine a significant amount of people not even caring but just wanting to be douches. It’s prolly gonna be a little like that. It won’t even be about the PvP
---
which makes you an asshole pretty much as rest of your guild, but given that rep doesnt mean shit today with so many ppl on each server, i guess you do you
---
Which is irrelevant, the point of comparison is their classic release plan. Not how it was 15 years ago.
---
It's not like the spawn rate is shit and it's an entire week to attune. I can't see it being bad other than guilds trolling and locking it down. If an unbalanced faction decides to be shitheads it's Guna suck for the underrepresented faction
---
I hope your dick gets put in a blender you fucking pedo
---
HOW DARE YOU?!?! I rolled on a PvP realm and I'm sick of getting killed by PvP. I will report any high level that kills me and I will QQ until everyone leaves me alone.
---
Don't you dare bring up PVE realms again, I'm here to stay on PvP realm and I demand action by the GMs in stopping my deaths by PvP. .
---
Lfm Onyxia, need all, Head res
---
No it doesnt?!?!?
---
I've played both and I think they are kinda even. However in spf the walks are shorter.
---
If your a warrior you'll need 350 arenas anyways 😂😂
---
Still a clown fiesta, but relatively balanced. Will have to see what it is like after BGs
---
Yep, but i think they are talking about just getting to bwl in general if it is a shit show.
---
Nice, looking forward to results! In case you're doing regression and conclude on the entire WoW Classic population as a whole - don't forget to add to your assumptions that respondents only from r/classicwow may violate the assumption of random sampling :)
---
Did work camping the city though, not sure how many others can pull that off.
---
There's many strategies that you need to keep in mind, and terrain tricks you can use. Sure, I may have the bad habit of being way too used to clicking bloodrage or defensive stance, but I really just have gotten used to clicking these too, so much that it is faster than binding them and getting used to it again.
---
Even if you think its slower, these are in fact such slight details in-front of say..the fact that 90% of people don't buy superior healing pots or farm root tubers, essentially gimping themselves from basically 160 stamina per fight, since their cooldown is quite low.
---
The problem with no changes is that the community has changed a lot. Much of the "world pvp" is just plain griefing and it would be great if we could stop that.
---
Selfishness.
---
Tell your hunter to speak up or find another guild. I suspect if he speaks up he'll have to find another guild anyway.
---
This is the classic wow experience. I truly hope this is not patched out.
---
Huge loss
---
This isn't gonna go away people, if it isn't this it's dungeons entrances or something else. The idea that people had of "World pvp" doesn't exist.  
---
If you roll on a pvp server you're gonna get ganked and camped. people don't wanna fight unless they think they can win.  
---
I ran into a horde when leveling on a pve server, we both turned pvp on, i smacked his cow face in, and we went on our merry way, now i coulda camped his corpse, if so he could just log out or stay dead for 5 mins while getting a sandwich and come back.
---
Use it to your advantage and start a big rogue-only stealth pvp raid
---
That’s on the dps standing in front of the tank.  People love creeping forward in MC for some reason.
---
Sure thing, but do come try to 2man stormwind and see how you perform
---
So you are saying in MMORPG 60:40 is not playable? 
---
Lets assume a PVP situation, 2 raids PVP.ing, the other raid has 40 people and the other one has 60 people, are you claiming its unplayable for the 40 players and there is nothing they can do?
---
"ou also fail to realise that, with servers having much higher population caps than vanilla"
---
You fail to realize how percentages work.... Its all proportional, come on now...
---
I got the saber mount as a gnome. If you did complete most darnassus quests on your road to lvl 60 you should be arround 1000 rep into the revered. After this you will need 380-400x stacks of runecloth. You should spam the world and trade chat, that people should COD their runecloth to you.  Stay away from AH prices. So it's a bit pricier.
---
Flamestrike causes more aggro iirc
---
I'm noob whats a world buff. The Ony and uhh other dude's buff in Org?
---
Get rekt
---
I think you are basing your negative opinion on pre-combat log nerf information. Spy is just a fancy kos manager at this point.
---
Should've played pve server much more "playable" xd
---
&gt;that is reasonable right?
---
Yes.
---
&gt;do you think we will still be able to find another hunter?
---
&gt;we could even give him first dib on tier
---
Why not leave the guild yourself? And why give the new hunter priority but not the current hunter?
---
all my friends that quit will have something to say about ur faction data.
---
Is it not wierd that People wanted the vanilla experience on the Pvp realms. And when They get just that they bitch about it?
---
There is nothing to fix here. You wanted vanilla Pvp, this is it.
---
Yes, but are they to single target frost bolt all 5 mobs before aoeing? And do you think they will?
---
I did that too.. Damn friends fucking everything up.

Even before p2 it was nigh unplayable on my server. I leveled in instances from 30 - 60. When I levelled in the world I saw 10 horde for each alliance. Didn't always get killed like you do now, but so many zones were just impossible to level in so I was forced into instances.
---
Sure PUGs can roll. But the GL is already reserving items he wants.
---
Seems like a scummy selfish person to me.
---
We were bitching aboutvthis in beta
---
Who would have known that when a game is lacking in pve content they all revert to wpvp canping
---
Idiocy has peaked here today.
---
Hey everyone, I just rolled a dwarf holy priest a few hours ago, currently sitting at level 7. it's my first time playing wow ever. My question is is it okay to level up through dungeons? I know it's slower but I like doing stuff as a group, I hate running around doing quests solo.
---
Also if I want the best end-game equipmetn should I pick engineering and tailoring as my two professions? I have no interest in pvp btw
---
Ignore that guy.
---
It's always best to be in a guild that likes and respects you. Regardless of loot priority.
---
If you don't feel this at your guild, just leave.
---
no
---
Have a hunter question regarding dal rend. Would you as a hunter with greens roll for the dal rend main hand/off hand? If it depends what would it depend on.
---
I just set up my healing abilities as mouseover macros and heal on custom unit frames. Works like a charm.
---
Play whatever you find the most fun but if being an underrepresented class is what you like then you're looking mainly at druid. Warlock is also up there, you can always play both your main and your alt though.
---
I know how percentages work. I'm not saying it's unplayable, just that 50% more players is a large advantage. 
---
To be honest, I think you're just trolling at this point or being purposefully dishonest. Especially as you counted alliance dominated PvE servers into your equation.
---
Awesome video like always !
---
You'd need test dummies to do this, and I dont think they were implemented until late TBC or wrath.
---
Here's what 60:40 means. It means that the non tryhards of horde will feel free to roam around, while the non tryhards of alliance will get demoralised and hide in dungeons. That 60:40 turns into 70:30 very fast, which then means more horde free roaming and more alliance castling which leads to 80:20 etc.
---
Math gets thrown out of the window when you consider the human factor.
---
Also, calculate PvP servers only before you go all high and mighty, because that's not applicable to PvE.
---
Depends on the server, plenty of alliance dicks ganking my alts for no honor too, bud

Hey glad i found this thread. I got quite a specific question: as an Orc is DB/Flurry superior to DB/Felstriker ? and if so i guess i should take CALgloves or muggers belt  with me i guess right?
---
&gt;You literary said “this is so not true” two comments up. 
---
yes I did. not sure what you're getting on about. literally, every server, is not horde dominated. 
---
&gt;And Deviate Delight, while alliance heavy, is not a PvP server. It is an RPPvP server, which is categorized differently.
---
Today I learned a PvP server is not a PvP server. RP or not. still PvP. Gonna have to write that down for future reference.
---
I'm sure there's already a limit. I remember back in vanilla or tbc some addons were spamming sync messages and they had to limit the amount of messages addons can send. It probably wasn't a problem before but now many classic servers have huge amounts of people so the message spam can be intense even with the limits.
---
You can only disappoint your player base for so long. Look at retail.
---
Define "too big"? Current average server population is approximately the same as full server in vanilla (3-3.5k) with 5-6k peak at raid time for several exceptional servers Blizz issued a lot of warnings to be overcrowded.
---
Botting is a bigger problem than wpvp.  Wpvp will die down in 2 weeks but botters silently screw the economy, and nobody likes playing with cheaters under your nose.  Botters make the world smaller, less socialization happens because you see 40 people in a zone, but nobody communicates.  I personally think most of these complainers have just made the wrong decision to roll on pvp servers because streamers said pvp servers are the only way to play the game.  Hardcore pvpers have just duped many newbies because they just want more people to farm from.
---
Dire maul east jump runs are the most profitable imo. 2-4 rtv after the end boss. You can run them in around 15m each, so that's 8-12 rtv/hour, which is more than I've ever found out in the wild.
---
This looks pretty awesome
---
Yep.  Just like CLASSIC WOW. Can't please anyone /smh
---
For the low low price of 59.99.
---
Also, it took severak month before ragnaros was killed. It took one week on classic, and even on low pop server, you can find dozen of people in full epic gear.
---
Back then, even the lvl 60 weren't extremely well geared and a lower level could decently have a shot to retaliate. Not in classic because each of the 6 guys ganking you is twice or thrice as strong as you
---
Screw you for making me downvote baby yoda :L
---
I was games 8 times in 2 hours the other day by alliance in WPL. Sometimes I sit at the Bulwark and just stare into the distance instead of actually questing
---
If both groups have the same amount of gear then the 60 players will always win. Noone claimed it unplayable btw it's just an uphill battle against bigger horde pops and horde having better pvp racials which snowballs into alliance just afk'ing in ironforge. Even a 10player difference in any given zone can completely force the other faction out of that zone, the numbers might be proportional but zone size is not
---
"Can't you just abandon the main you've got 13 days /played on, a bunch of gold and gear etc., any alts on that realm, to start over without even having the ability to send gold to your new char???"
---
The combat log range nerf and player buffs not appearing in the combat log basically fixed everything this vid is trying to portray. People just like to jump on the hype train, but they end up spreading more misinformation.
---
I mean it's 1v1 afk player roughly every 3-5 minutes. Hard to beat that consistent and more importantly steady honor out in the world.
---
Alliance here and I got no problem with it. Dying in Ironforge has absolutely 0 consequence besides maybe delaying your trip to the mailbox.
---
They provide free honor for all alliance in the area as well, so they're helping me achieve my low bar of reaching rank 3 :)
---
Because it solves a lot of issues and can bring back the enjoyment in the game. I say it's not really a solution because at the moment wPvP issues and faction balance aren't particularly solved by this, but the main topic here is.
---
There were warnings about the same thing here in this subreddit: some handwaving of it aged like milk when the same person says "it won't be like that" before classic launch then complaints about "several corpseruns to brd" after p2 hits.
---
Zandalari Tribe, EU RPPVP is currently alliance dominant. And they're doing all the zep camping and flight master camping they can. It's not impossible to level as horde, but it's damn frustrating to have to die 7 times flying to lights hope.
---
But it wasn't like this before P2, at least not on my server. Did human nature change so quick?
---
I’ve heard you lose 2 percent instantly so that makes sense
---
All the American pvp servers are horde dominated. That’s why alliance is complaining.....it isn’t that hard
---
You only get DKs from killing civilian NPCs
---
I'm also pretty sure they've nerfed the spawn rates of ore. 
---
I ran 2 laps in Ungoro crater and got 2 nodes, there were 4 other alliance in the zone, saw like 3 horde during this time. So I hearthed and went to Burning Steppes, got like 3 thorium in the lap I did. 
---
Feels like such a fucking waste of time.
---
if only this guy knew that his faction does the exact same thing in tanris, and camps the zepplins in org, and that this was a possible retaliation from players getting tired of the griefing, so they took the griefing to the enemies own turf
---
He said almost every PvP server is horde dominated. Key word ALMOST, learn to read.
---
They are not going to start over, LOL.
---
Read the comment you replied to again. Nobody said literally every server.
---
"It's purple so I'll just need that as a matter of principle. No idea what it is though."
---
So it took 3 weeks to fix a bug that was related to time zones ?
---
I just don't understand the lack of basic support for Classic.
---
We'll see in 12 days now with the release of bg, then it depends on possible transfer , if not , will play something else or go back to pserver if blizzard can't run the game properly
---
How so?
---
Been stuck at 51 for a few days now, it's PvP I get it but playing alone all the time and getting jumped by 3 to 4 player groups gets old fast.
---
No ChAnGeS
---
How dare you! I posted this a few days ago and it was removed from the mods violating rule 7...
---
I saw the discussion to the mods “talking about” altering the rule...and now memes ares not being removed, hence my title
---
Twice? Try more like 10 times before you even reach the boat.
---
Well *!@# me in the $%^
---
Wow, you know how to percentage, congratulation!
---
So lets expand on your example of 60:40.
---
Lets say 600 vs 400, still even?
---
Why not add some more, 6000 vs 4000, wow its almost exactly the same. Zzzzzzzzzzz
---
As you might or might not be able to see, percentage isn't the best way at painting a picture in all situations.

"Ignore everything, we're gonna open up paid transfers and introduce BGs so that they'll have to pay even more cash to play classic! Free money!" ~Blizzard
---
Alliance camps the rooftops in Orgrimmar even on a PvE server
---
Doesn’t matter where you go, what server or faction.
---
Horde has better PVP racials than Alliance while Alliance has better PVP synergy for BG premades thanks to paladins. This means in wpvp Horde is slightly better, which results more people rolling Horde, which makes them even better in wpvp thanks to sheer numbers. Expected balance was around 60/40 in Horde favor for pvp servers and 65/35 for Alliance on pve servers, but Blizzard messed it up by introducing free transfers from overpopulated servers. Unhappy by 60/40 alliance transferred out immediately to their safe havens and left those who stayed to die from extintion.
---
I've healed since vanilla without any healing add-ons. Just enable "blizzard raid frames in party" and it will highlight when someone is buffed with your HoT or debuffed with something you can dispell
---
The first per day isn't that hard. But the follow ones
---
you guys gonna make these threads 50 times a day right up until BGs finally release. maybe they wont help but honestly id rather be on the minority faction once BGs are in. less que times + you should still hopefully find enemies to fight in the wild.
---
Depends on the name. Some people think anything they don't personally like means it's offensive and should be censored.
---
Dead meme
---
Oh this forum changed quite a bit since release. What happened to #nochange? ;-)
---
Yes, because the server they transfer from (the faction left there) is doomed even more. This is exactly what lead to the imbalance we see now, non-faction specific transfers introduced.
---
what's your combined /played on those?
---
got 2 60's now and considering the third
---
Main ones Ony buff and if they got the tribute buffs from DM.
---
That quests would grant extra XP if submitted within a certain timeframe. We called it chain questing.
---
Been playing since release and have had minimal camping issues. You all kinda sound like cry babies if I'm being honest. 
---
Camping happens, it's part of wow. If it's THAT big of a deal- why did you roll PvP? Instead of crying for fixes you should really be contemplating that question. 
---
 If it gets too rough log for a bit or go somewhere else. It's not that big of a deal.
---
go slow 2h for dungeons, open with whirlwind from charge and get all the aggro for days, any mobs needed to be actually tanked can be taunted etc
---
&gt;paying customers
---
That's exactly the cornerstone here, Blizzard doesn't care as long as you're paying (especially since you're minority here).
---
&gt;to solve their issues
---
Wrong, it's not their issue, it's your issue. It will be their issue only if you stop paying.
---
Old time player here. I’ve since stopped playing classic because the nostalgia wore off, but I don’t understand everyone’s complaints about this. This is what it was back before...but the player-base had no clue what they were doing so it wasn’t as frequent. I spent countless hours back in the day sitting in the enemy capital killing players because it’s what I enjoyed. I had so many fun memories both getting my ass kicked and killing other players. It’s a shame to see people complain about this 15 years later because these are my most fond memories of the game blaring As I Lay Dying while I wrecked people. When wall jump was a thing, it amplified my enjoyment too and I made a Hunter and killed people from the roofs. I did play on a PvE server to be fair back then so it was your fault if I killed you, but to be on a PvP realm and complain about PvP....c’mon....
---
You chose the server, you pay the price. 
---
Also, fuck the Alliance.
---
Well they had the mage tower trials or w/e.  The new expo supposedly has another tower with roguelike elements thats playable solo.
---
Haha I played on Azgalor Horde side in vanilla. No one had the wide access to guides and videos. People were still trying to make there way to 60. It was not this bad. Horde is camping alliance cause they have nothing better to do. Alliance does the same thing. Pick a class watch a video and follow a guide and within weeks Ding 60. It's everyones know it all attitude that is ruining this game. Screw the guides and videos and just play the game.
---
I got a lot of people to believe my rogue was female because they got a higher backstab bonus.
---
Decursive looks like exactly what I'm looking for, thanks! I'm not looking to do anything to the default UI, since I've always liked it, and it's pretty unobtrusive.
---
Then what convention could you use to actually begin a group??
---
why so ?
---
Have you tried playing horde? I have been hard camped by ally countless times. Both at my corpse and spirit healer, forcing me to log off. Ive been ganked 5 times in a row, by the same group of players, making  a circle around me, wanding me down, while spitting on me, again forcing me to log off. Both sides can be jerks buddy.
---
but u can get out of cities right ?
---
You wish it's only 350 lol.
---
Everyone here acting like alliance are little fucking angels . I have an asshole gnome usually at least ten levels higher gank my ass on the daily and I don’t come to reddit to cry. I just find a new area . You alliance aren’t the sad babies yummy our make yourselves out to be.
---
....you never pop zerk rage before pulling?  In MC you can’t charge, but in 5 mans you can.  Makes sense to do it if you’re at 0 rage since you can; zerk stance, zerk rage, battle stance, charge, battle shout def stance, blood rage, sunder.
---
Confirmed where? Crybaby
---
I got my priest to 60 doing mostly dungeons. Its defenitely slower than just grinding, but I personally like farming dungeons better. Just level the way you like, as it will be way more fun! Furthermore, I would suggest picking skinning + herb/mining at first to get some gold going, and swap one gathering profession for tailoring at a later level (save up all your cloths in the meantime). 
---
If youre not interested in pvp, defenitely roll on a pve server, especially as alliance. 
---
Have fun leveling!
---
It takes me 45 minutes to get to UBRS and 1 hour to get to BRD because the Horde grief the ever living fuck out of Blackrock Mountain, Burning Steppes and Searing Gorge. The only thing that keeps me playing is I'm OT and we have MC and Ony on farm. But the allure of gear isn't enough to offset the fucking rage inducing bullshit that an unbalanced PvP server has given me.
---
No, you can't coordinate an alliance counter attack. It's too imbalanced with 4 full raids defending every inch. Fuck you, 'shouldn't have rolled pvp' douche bags. This meta is born from the imbalance Blizzard has failed to address.
---
At this rate, I'll get my nostalgia high from Halo coming to the PC and I'll take the friends I convinced to play WoW again with me.
---
oh "almost" . I'm so horribly wrong. My bad everyone. My semantics game is weak apparently.
---
Yeah this is why war mode was basically unplayable for me. Random world pvp with someone around your level is fun and exciting. But the camping of low levels is griefing and the least fun thing ever.
---
Get rekt pleb, kek.
---
I am completely against this. If you want to play a different faction, than you should level a new character.
---
Various points that might interest you :
---
- at level 60, the experience you would have gained for a 48+ quest is converted into money. So if a quest like "kill 30 spiders" give you 2g10s and 4500xp at level 54, it may give you around 5g40s and 0xp at level 60 (approx numbers). Holding on quests is a common method for gaining gold, so you really don't much by skipping some for now.
---
- Do dungeons. As other said, since Maraudon and beyond there is some gear knowned as pre-raid best in slot. Spam dungeons and gather good gear right now. Waiting until lvl60 to do so wouldn't be recommanded. If you're lucky and prepared enough, you could be raid-ready the second you hit level 60.
---
- Think about your mount. It costs ~900gold. So don't spend too much, and already think of clever ways of gathering gold if you don't have much right now (which is normal).
---
- Armor is not the primordial stat for warrior tank. You want some +defense to be able to parry/dodge/block more efficiently, you need some +hit and some raw strenght/damage in order to keep a high amount of threat (and allow your group to be safer). Think of it this way : the damage dealers you play with currently are in green questing gear. You will need to be able to hold threat versus some raid-geared dps soon enough.
---
Don't do this to me. Not this early on a beautiful Sunday 😭😭
---
Honestly with the lack of OHs right now I’m shooting for SoD over Mageblade so I don’t think you fucked up at all. If you compare raw stats the difference is negligible.
---
No shit. Non constructive my ass. Although from the way blizz works these days it would make sense if they had a different working definition of the word constructive.
---
Server transfers were available in vanilla, so they definitely are coming
---
sunk cost fallacy
---
It's totally feasible, but you will find dry patches where your only choice is dungeons that many players won't want to run (SFK, Gnomer, RFK). You would spent a lot of time just looking for a group. Supplement dungeons with quests and you'll have a great time.  
---
Engineering is seen predominantly as a PvP profession. Certainly tailoring will be beneficial to you. Tailoring synergises well with Tailoring as you can disenchant the items you make from tailoring. Alternatively take Tailoring + Gathering profession (mining, herbing or skinning) as a gold maker
---
Auto correct to help some of the typing issues? I guess maybe?
---
I started at launch and am 44 with my shaman.
---
Well, retail is great every other expac.  So idk.
---
Some sort of Real Men Play PvP nonsense. I played PvP in actual vanilla (Illidan, Horde) and I remember the griefing: STV and Hillsbrad were unplayable, the first kill of Azuregos was griefed badly, specific guilds ( DIE - Deaths Imperial Entourage in particular)  would run around group ganking people, taking screenshots then posting them on their websites like trophies. The weirdest experience i had was in tanaris where i got sap/stun locked by a rogue - and presumably because i was playing a female tauren - while he kept me locked there he used leet speak to write out ' r u girl??? R u girl irl???' (At the time numbers and symbols could still be seen cross faction). (Hell, a few months after i left Illidan the infamous Serenity Now funeral raid happened. Some if my friends attended that funeral. It was hella gross and hearing about it from them put me off PvP servers permanently.)
---
There was PvE server shittalking at the time (the term 'carebear' was quite popular for describing PvE servers) - but nothing on the scale of 'PvP is the norm and what *real* men play' expectations i've seen as part of classic. Its ridiculous.  PvP servers are time wasters unless you enjoy the thrill of escaping level 60s as a level 45. The degree of it obviously changed with the honor system... but its obvious a lot of folks would have been happier on PvE servers. Its a shame now that so many people are realizing it this late.
---
(However, if you play on Faerlina we all knew that one would be a shitshow from the beginning. I have no idea why anyone that was intending to actually play Vanilla and enjoy the game for what it is would roll on that server. Like if you're into the streamer mob experience that's one thing... but for people who want to play the game normally that server was never, ever going to be that. )
---
Not sure if I would count it as micro.
---
Hunters pet position matters a lot especially in raid.  You can't really just macro a pet attack into something because sometimes you don't want to send your pet in, because the way they attack it always from the side, so it could pull additional mobs.
---
Warlocks either sac the pet entirely in raiding, or in pvp just use them as an extension for certain abilities.  Like felpuppy just gives you 2 new spells.  90% of the time you just have it on passive at your side.  Only reason you'd even have it attack really would be to maintain a combat state vs rogues and LoS'ers.
---
if you have 30+ guildies regularly showing up then just go with that and stop pugging. MC is not hard enough for you to need a full 40 raid, hell we do 2x MC runs a week with 20x well geared mains and 10x shitty geared alts and finish in like 1 hour 20 mins with no problems.
---
Oh shit, Ix thought server transfers were a thing. I guess not tho.
---
If you had more gold on firemaw, how would that matter?
---
No changes.
---
Lol. That might trigger OP, but this is honestly the way to do it. The guild I’m in had to pug like 50% of the raid when we started on MC. Our tank was the guild leader, raid leader, and our main tank. He still left it to MS &gt; OS rolls with no reservations. What did we gain from this? Well we got consistent pugs. Guys who progressed with us, joined us weekly, helped each other attune for Ony, geared up along side of us, and we got to know these guys pretty well. Pretty soon it got to the point where it just didn’t make sense to not be in the same guild. Now, we pug like 1 or 2 people for our raid. OT’s will pass on gear for the MT even if he doesn’t ask them to. DPS classes are willing to roll on weapons and trade them to loyal raiders who haven’t won much or passed on upgrades so that lesser geared raiders could get stronger. It would be unfair for our pugs to reserve such sought after items. Maybe we just got a good group of guys with us, maybe we’re still in the early stages of our guild, or maybe if you treat your raiders with respect and fairness they won’t treat your guild like a loot dispensary.
---
Male gnomes have the best voice. Period.
---
I've been on Ash, it's balanced but it doesn't feel as alive as Firemaw
---
Firemaw is about 60/40 so not bad at all
---
Nostalgia for me is getting world buffs for our kill attempt on sapphiron but Blood Legion finds out what we are doing and camps north tower buff in epl. They wipe us 40v40 and we lose our world buffs, zone in and kill sapph without them on the next try.
---
Hey just saying the truth, not my fault ally players are so thin skinned.
---
I was so excited to see Winterspring. After an hour of corpse running, today I made it from Feralas into Winterspring! 
---
But Winterspring is the worst I've ever seen. 10+ horde 60'ties running around in a circle killing guards and players over and over. Absolute dreadful leveling experience.
---
Yesterday I had great fun questing in a party in UnGoro though, with fair fights and a 50/50 kill death ratio. But attempting to quest solo in Winterspring today is impossible.
---
For ony I never slow dps, the name of the game is making sure you get fireballed to lower/wipe your threat. Then as always if you have aggro in phase 3 use a lip not 100% sure if you can’t generate additional threat during the duration but you can’t take aggro. Give your tank a second to grab her and go back to dpsing.
---
sunk cost fallacy doesnt really apply to a video game... if its more efficient time wise to level a character to 60 on a new realm, id rather just quit point
---
Hey now this isnt funny, i lost dick in a blender and this really hurts my feelings /s
---
Either its all funny or none of its funny. I sincerely doubt an actual pedo would be so brazen to make his name a reference to it.
---
Also, stay mad it suits you.
---
yeah i tought about the server population and ash doesnt seem to be that popular compared to prob 2 or 3 most popular eu serv firemaw
---
Oh ok I get it now. ty
---
Im sorry but thats not how maths work. Your % number is absolute garbage and you should know it yourself.
---
The increase from 55/45 to 65/35 will give you a 10% bump on your 'domination' metric, while the increase from 85/15 to 95/5 will also give you a 10% bump on your domination metric.
---
You absolutely fail to realize that the percentage does not follow a linear scale. As for demonstration, in one of the cases it changes the ratio from about 1.2:1 to 1.8:1 while in the other case it changes the ratio from about 5.7:1 to 19:1.
---
The 10% in your domination metric can literally mean anything between a 50% imbalance between factions and a 1000% (mathematically this can go up infinitely high numbers as you go closer to reaching the 100/0 mark) imbalance between factions.
---
You are not only being mathematically wrong by doing the simplest possible calculation hoping for  the possibility of making a sob post claiming how opressed the horde are over the entire game, (!) but you are also being disingenuous. You fail to mention how many of the servers are pvp and how many of the servers are pve. Is there possibly any trend you would like to tell us about there? Remember, on pve servers, players can choose to turn off their pvp flag and basically have immunity against the opposing faction, no matter how outnumbered they are. I guess you should provide your domination metric for the case of all pvp and all pve servers separate, for the sake of clarity, even though the metric is absolute garbage.
---
lmao what kind of toxic shitfests do you play usually if you consider wow world pvp is not toxic
---
Well if they are going to complain about being killed on a pvp server I have no sympathy for them. There is a clear choice and if you don't want to deal with people greifing then don't play on a pvp server. And we are on phase 2 of 6? There is plenty of time to reroll.
---
it's ok, no one wants to play it anyway, stop being so toxic!!111elevenone
---
on the other hand we have a beautiful "retail" game that has a FULL TEAM SUPPORT! don't you want your problems solved? think of it -  LFG aka instant group forming, transmog, flying mounts, artifact something-something. stop being so stuborn. it's an old game anyway!
---
just give it a try? plz?
---
"So lets expand on your example of 60:40. Lets say 600 vs 400, still even? Why not add some more, 6000 vs 4000, wow its almost exactly the same. Zzzzzzzzzzz"
---
Are you actually seriously asking this? Because YES, 6000v4000 is as even as 6v4.
---
IMO the best serv is Gehennas but the Que is horrific, so not worth it
---
I truly wish they were, but I doubt Blizzard will ever let us escape the shitholes we're stuck in. After all, that'd make the problem worse on that server and risk turning it into basically a horde only server, so I'm guessing they'll just keep us trapped forever.
---
If they do end up allowing server transfers to PvE servers I'll be resubbing and be right over, though.
---
There are a couple of addons that give you the ability to change up your bars.  I used to always use Bartender.
---
Also for the issue with cheap shot/kidney you can just make a macro something like below.  It will cheap shot only in stealth, otherwise kidney.  It also always shows kidney because i think you'd want to know the CD even while stealthed.
---
    #showtooltip Kidney Shot
---
    /cast [stance:1] Cheap Shot; Kidney Shot
---
"If both groups have the same amount of gear then the 60 players will always win."
---
False, there is personal input involved, its not a slot machine. 40 people can ABSOLUTLY maul 60 people any day of the week with better tactic.
---
Also you gotta have it equipped prior to the fight since you‘ll never have a chance shen facing a mage to go ooc to use it all the time
---
Ouch!  After 5 eye of divinity now we got 4x leaf, it's never eye/leaf/eye/leaf is it? :P
---
im on that server rn haha leveled 4 levels nad thought about the long game end diceded i might swap realms
---
Bgs will be cross realm so who knows we will see soon.
---
I disagree, 60:40 is barely noticable ingame, i play on a 60:40 server..
---
I´ve played since early classic days on Grim batol, top 3 largest servers in EU during Vanilla.
---
It sure as shit wasnt like this.
---
I can hop on my old hunter at Grim Batol EU if you want to check.
---
and gehennas is not really balanced
---
I have a 40 something rogue there, I just can't deal with ques, I work late
---
With that kind of money you could artificially inflate a market or two.  For example:  there are 20 arcane crystals on the auction house listed for 45g, and 20 arcanite bars. listed for 50g.  You could buy them all out and list the arcane crystals for 55g and the bars for 60 or more.  People will come along and inflate their prices too, and you may be able to turn a profit out of the extra 10g per item you carved out.  Of course this could backfire bigtime, such is speculation.
---
I made about 200g selling fused wirings off a guy who tried to buy out the whole market like this.  I kept putting them up, and he kept buying them for up to about 7g.  In the subsequent weeks he was selling them at a loss on AH for 3 or 4g.  The problem is that he bought an item that I could mass produce.  Things like arcane crystals can only be farmed, and there are only so many rich thorium nodes.  You can bet at any given time most of the arcane crystals on the server that aren't being saved for crafting are listed on AH or transmuted into arcanite.
---
I'm totally against fraction transfers. Gnomes are short enough as it is. I don't need 1/2 of one of them running around, I'd never be able to see them.
---
I do not think the issues we are having now are a long term thing. 
---
Changing server in favour of a lower population server now would only be a short term solution leading to a long term problem.
---
There's a list out there that has about 200 changes/bugs. The nochanges spammers still think they are in charge though.
---
The balance is evened out with Salad Bakers and Apes - my opinion.
---
But it does apply, if it turns out  you don't enjoy pvp servers there is no point continuing to play on them. We have plenty of phases and content coming anyone who makes the switch now is doing themselves a favor
---
If you're not organized by now, BWL will likely ruin the guild.
---
If it's been a pug for weeks now, then it's not a guild run. It's a pug group.
---
If it's unlimited it could be tested and confirmed easily enough
---
Massive sense of entitlement here, based on pure speculation above.
---
&gt;Is this true or are alliance players just more vocal about their grievances.
---
In PVP servers? Yes, in basically every single PVP server the Horde outnumber the Alliance. There are a few exceptions (one apparently). Overall? Horde outnumbers the Alliance as well, as there are more PVP servers than PVE (6 to 1 ratio in EU-EN in example). 
---
&gt;If it is true, why do people want to be trolls and corpses over dwarves and night elves?
---
There are many reasons. Some from the top of my head:
---
* The Horde outnumbers the Alliance at level 120 in retail. This difference is very significant in competitive play (mythic raiding, but it drops down to HC raiding, Mythic+ and so on). I really think that Retail balance leaked into Classic balance.
---
* At a race-level, Horde does have stronger PVP racials. Hardiness is extremely powerful. WOTF weakens priests and warlocks. For individual play, those racials can make a big difference, encouraging more people to roll Horde.
---
* Due to different reasons, Horde have the upper hand in PVP in Retail and this has been brought to Classic as well. There are more of them in PVP servers and there will be more of them queueing for BGs. 
---
* One common quote is "Alliance races are boring". Unfortunately, I agree but for different reasons as the people who say this. I think that the main problem is that Alliance races suffered a lot during the transition from Warcraft 3 to WoW. In example, Night Elves. They were the most popular race in WC3 and I think that they came across as great in both WC3 campaigns (especially ROC). WoW Night Elves pale in comparison. Both Dwarves and Gnomes have too much comedic relief built into them. Their voices, their animations and so on. Those factors hurt the *playability* of the Alliance in different aspects. 
---
* There's a big factor of learned defenselessness (a psychological concept). I think that there's a big defeatist mentality being rooted in the Alliance, which is bizarre if you think about it. How could that be when there are so many different players? But I've seen this with BG win ratios during past years (most BGs, except the two big ones, had roughly a 40:60 split, which is 50% more victories for the Horde). I think that small things like perceived Horde favouritism can maim motivation. I'm not a fan of this topic in particular, but it's strange how Blizzard decided to tackle the vanilla faction balance (which was in favour of the Alliance) with very bold decisions, how they decided to implement Mercenary Mode which contradicts a lot of their reasoning for no cross-faction raiding, yet they will do nothing about faction balance in retail (at competitive level) or how they planned nothing about potential Classic faction imbalance. If you disagree with this topic, I want you to think how PVP servers would look like in a potential TBC Classic release.
---
That's not harder, just takes way more time and dedication.
---
That doesnt make any sense, why would it make it more obnoxious? There is more people to gank you, but there is more people on your side too, you clearly DONT understand how percentages work. 
---
Always the same thing with people "yea but percentages change depending on how the sample size" yea no it does not, thats not how math works.
---
Come on. Skipping one day of sleeping isn't going to transform you into some dumb being that makes mistakes like this. You made  an alt with a weird name, mailed some silver and a pot to it, then you bought it with your main and posted it with a fake ass title.
---
no idea acctually but i wonder if people there even that social or they just like robot apes: grind, grind, kill, kill
---
can you please explain this? i thought its just one time, instant -100 ranking points
---
People say dungeons but the fact is that you can't even get to the instance entrance. Both the road to the instances and the instances themselves are heavily patrolled and camped by hordies.
---
I haven’t played wow in a few years but is this new? The entire point of having playing in a pvp server is that you take on the risk of being camped.
---
Can you be punished for ganking now?
---
Its amazing how quickly everyone screamed for instanced PvP the moment we got World PvP. Guess you really cant shake the retail out of people. O well, those of us who didn't give up immediately and quit got to have a blast with big world pvp battles.
---
Auction "won"
---
Thanks AH, but I wouldn't call that a Win
---
Horde has better racial abilities in classic. So with everyone now and days having better knowledge of the game everyone is rolling characters that are listed as better online.
---
I'm not here to convince you otherwise, play ignorant or inform me buddy - but everything I have read has pointed towards 3% hit increase specifically at 60. Under 60 it seems to scale even better, and missing less white attacks is a big deal whether you admit it or not.
---
????????
---
Or Blizzard could just balance the damn game.
---
Hmm.. elite guard protected docks, guards on ships, in protected zones?  For horde, check.  Unprotected docks, no guards, in contested zones?  For alliance, check!
---
It's terrible game design, no reason it should be like this.
---
gO pVe Or StOp CrYiNg
---
That comment. "All need roll?" 🤣
---
They really just don’t care all that much about classic. Sad really! They are frustrating a lot of die hard blizz fans with their lack of... well anything with classic.
---
On a PVE server, none of those problems exist. So I’m enjoying myself immensely and I’m ready to dive into BGs as soon as they release.
---
Relevant username.  Calm down, champ.
---
No, I am comparing two games. Apples to apples. Classic vs TBC.
---
Casual guilds are doing MC easily. There are simply no progress guilds. I never saw a guild recruiting in chat that was not 10/10 unless they are looking for people for their first raid. That reddit poll also recently showed that like 80% of lvls 60 cleared MC which is a fuckton even if we assume some lied.
---
Compare that to tbc where pro guilds cleared kara easily, but many casuals did not. In fact many were stuck on Shade of Aran before the whole instance was nerfed.
---
Who tf goes down to the lower decks?
---
But, did you upvote the post?
---
server sizes are already a change and that change is very impacting on the game so now we are in need of the snowball more changes or reverting the change and set a hard limit on 2.5k players on every server at all hours
---
Firemaw EU  is BRUTAL now, faction balance is pretty even but Alliance is more hardcore set on pvp and grief the HELL out of hordes. they have taking over basically anything everywhere and every flightpath is several rogues. They are just more coordinated aswell. they rush over anything like the plague of stratholme or even faster. People are struggling to even get a damn bar of exp a day out in the world. Currently doing the 50-60 stretch on a hunter and I level slower than my warrior did on release. Sure I rolled on a PVP server but the world feel so insanely small with the numbers Firemaw has. The honor greed is extreme and its valuable to just constantly gank 10 lvls below you. It doesnt help that there is addons that makes it impossible to hide behind rocks or other objects either. Thats the absolute worst part of it all. Remember Tracking was a nice hunter skill? No its shit cause now everyone has an addon that does it better.  Personally Ive been doing some alts on PVE servers but no way in hell am I doing the grind over again and I also have a very nice raidguild.  Being horde I sincerely hope that alliance gets short ques so they stay the fuck out of levelling zones. Regarding the above picture with hordes ganking grey lowbies thats griefing in its worst form and I fucking hate it.  But dont go around thinking this is a faction matter. Griefers gon grief regardless. also fuck mages and rogues. fuck em all. /An extremely frustrated player
---
+1
---
People allready think servers with no queue are dead.
---
You are wrong. You can take my number, divide it by 10 wich is the ammount of servers and LITERALLY get the average domination across the board. Holy fuckin shit, this is math for kids you guys make it seem like quantumn physics LOOOOL.
---
Take my numbers 670% and 698% divide it by 10 ( number of servers) and you get the average domination:
---
67.0% for horde and 69.8% for alliance. 
---
Did i really have to break this down for you? Jesus fuckin christ
---
Windseeker is very chill
---
There would be so many ways to abuse that
---
Never had a flair, but good job jumping on the bandwagon and posting about things you know nothing about. You're quite a sheep aren't you?
---
Windseeker is da bomb
---
Or just sold 100 gold to someone.
---
You don’t need imp FD to run tribute solo.
---
Fantastic! Hopefully it happens more frequent and is never fixed.
---
Bro I was playing om faerlina the other day (streamer server ... yeah yeah ... get used to it LoSeR or go to a pve server) and a 60 UD rogue with max stealth talents was camping marshal dughan.
---
Like the dude didnt care at all it was a DHK because he was just "trolling elwyn noobs" for his steam. We had a 60 human warr with hand of rag come help us but he couldnt even stop the rogue. I had to log out for a couple hrs from my alt just to complete hogger.
---
Seriously what the fuck Blizzard. Blizzard doesnt give a fuck about this game. Phase 2 is fucking tauren shit. I play a game and pay for it but the horde troll/griefers just fucking waste my time.
---
I get it, seriously, it's a pvp server with a shit load of people. But there is no GM... there are no bannable offenses... there is only asinine behavior from assholes 24/7 in this game.
---
-&gt;BLIZZARD: Either ban people, make guards lvl ?? And kill the griefers, or just fuck the entire player base and take our money. Oh wait...
---
Nice survey, but I wonder how you can actually use the result. No question about level of main, alts or if one has changes the main. I for example have changes my main 2 times, from male UD rogue to male UD warrior to female Tauren shaman. (playing female because I hardly see any female Taurens)
---
There would be, true. That's likely why they never did it now that you mention it.
---
Thanks! This is exactly what I was looking for
---
I think a combination is the best. Run dungeons a couple of times to do the quests  and get items you need until you get bored then do some solo quests.
---
I just take LFM as "I'm willing to start the group and do the spamming and inviting". So many people want to start a group but don't wanna be the guy who organises the group
---
I think the amount lost depends on your level, not some kind of kill streak.
---
\&gt; I have no life whatsoever

I just hit 60 on my alt in p2, it’s not unplayable you just need to find another way for a few weeks
---
God that would be beautiful. All the griefing fucks left over from each faction have to deal with each others shit. Poetry.
---
This. You people are fucking desperate for reddit attention.
---
Check sidebar and or google it. I no longer play
---
Quit complaining and just stick it out until the 10th like the rest of us being camped.
---
26 atm
---
I think you counted alliance from role play and pve servers in this.
---
It's not about wanting to play a different faction, it's about finding a solution to the faction imbalance. Which is in everyone's best interest.
---
DKP with arbitrary earned points is scummy as. My guild has set points you can earn, 30% decay and all items have specific costs. Gaining points for consumables shouldn't happen as there should be a raid grp wide agreement on what ppl are expected to use. You are in a shit guild.
---
Class?
---
It has the potential to be even worse too. Just random numbers, imagine if 2000 alliance and 4000 horde want to pvp and queue up. Instead of being outnumberded 2:1 in world pvp, both sides will now lose 2000 people to battlegrounds. That leaves 0 alliance and 2000 horde stuck outside bg's in queue. What do you think they will do while they wait?
---
Tbh fury prot is not so good in dungeons. But that‘s fine it wasn‘t made for dungeons anyway. Fury prot really shines on raids though, since bloodfury in def stance is absolutely amazing. Combining that with heroic strike and revenge on CD will makes you build insane amounts of threat and basically makes your dps never have to worry about aggro. 
---
Also once you have raid gear you can dtart running fury prot in dungeons and just equid a shield if your hesler isn’t so well geared or vs hard hitting enemies
---
Look, before AQ, the most costly things in classic wow are the Ragnaros mace, Windfury, some rare enchantment and GDKP. If you don't have plan for either of these, I can't think of any other purpose for sitting on that amount of gold.
---
&gt; Just shut up and ackn 
---
lol im alliance but you're a salty mad boi
---
Not trying to be sarcastic but PVE may just be a better environment due to player behavior
---
Oh, fair enough then I guesss
---
I don't think transfers being available so soon helped, as soon as people think that they're on the less populated side they transfer to get onto the more populated side.
---
Pray they don't find out what a Noggenfogger Elixir is.
---
What happens when I have 6 level 48s?
---
Thanks for confirming my suspicion about you. Bye
---
you should visit firemaw and change that to alliance
---
You don't know your father do you?
---
I know and personally I don't want guards on boats or zepps, although I haven't been a victim on the zepp nor have I camped in the boats. I just answered your question about who goes to the lower decks.
---
I guess it’s mostly down to racials. 
---
And I guess a good part of adult men that does not care about looks of their toons and if the surroundings looks nice or not will play horde also feel alliance is filled with younger ppl and women gamers. And they are ofc not wrong. Save for the emo’s playing undead ofc. 
---
In addition, these same oldish guys would probably be drawn more to pure muscle and general primitive power sort of. And horde has that theme for sure. 
---
I play alliance cause I care deeply about looking like a version of myself. But I don’t know anyone else that feels like I do amongst my fellow oldish men. They simply see me as vain. And looking at how they have aged bad I understand their view.
---
We also saw the motorcycle makers initiative they had many years ago. Horde was massively more popular. Driven by a strong masculine culture in the USA.
---
Made a warrior to find groups easy, but boy was i wrong
---
I know, and I agree that we should at the very least get more support.
---
They aren't handling the situation well from a consumer perspective. It feels like they really are putting in the absolute minimum resources needed, and don't really care about the longevity of the game. But then again, it would not surprise me if that was the case, Blizzard has a bad rep when it comes to being stingy/unethical etc.
---
They most likely have limited funds after accounting in the required profit-goals they have set. There's a reason why one of the largest and richest companies have to fire 800 employees, and underpay most of their staff (When I worked in Asia, the amount of money reinvested in companies there compared to in the vest, is ridiculous. They have a different view on profit, and it's more about making money asap over longevity)
---
I really do think that they just wanted to re-release the finished game and bank of it, without any sort of work or  intervention. That they anticipated issues, and that it would lose a lot of subs over the year. Even if they lose 70% of their subs within a year, it's still an insane profit when you think about how little they invested in it. And say 5-10% of the players go to retail, then it was also a massive win as a promotional tool.
---
It makes perfect sense for them to just hire a very small team of devs and support, and really restrict all inttervention/interactions with players.
---
Both comments agree with each other.  I even said it would be possible as a OT.  You don't swap MT during the raid.  If you did, it means you have an equally good regular tank who has more talents, defensive cooldowns, etc, that you are sidelining because you want the glory of MT.
---
Everyone can tank.  It's just a matter of for how long.
---
Using a shaman tank is irresponsible and essentially fucks 39 people because you want to try something new.  I am trying something new, I'm healing instead of reliving my glory days as dps.  You don't need to attempt to reinvent the wheel to do something new.
---
Besides, I never discounted 5 or 10 man dungeons.  You make it sound like you can show up for raid night and say, hey I know I was resto but I want to try something new. Will you let me MT tonight?
---
Of course it is, but blizzard needs to actually step up and ban them
---
I knew this would happen in PvP servers so I decided to roll PVE where I have the choice to do world pvp :) it’s great!!
---
If you're going to Jinthalor you're not exactly a lowbie anymore, 48+ zones are a no go but that was to be fully expected. 
---
 If anything I'm surprised how little ganking/corpse camping there is at the lower zones like STV or Hillsbrad, in Vanilla I definitely had it way worse.
---
But I guess that's also more to do with the fact that I'm Horde, I know what a shitfest Duskwood and Redridge can be and that has nothing to do with server population. If I was planning to roll Alliance I would have rolled on a pve server.
---
Ahh yes, so lets have a shitty queuing system because "no changes". Solid logic, why would we fix one of the biggest complaints from back then regarding BG queues? Fuck that.. no changes!
---
Please stop being very silly around this stuff. The idea is to bring back vanilla and provide a positive experience, not deliberately give people a shitty one "because it was like that back then".
---
I always used to think it was just to be edgy. It's not often you see traditional "monster" races playable. But now I'm not sure. It does certainly look like Horde players are much more likely to care about "faction pride" as a major part of the game.
---
I honestly think its because of the leveling. Horde has much more intuitive lvling, you finish your starting zone and you are immediately funneled to Barrens where you can stay for a long time. This makes the experience much smoother. Alliance on the other hand has to switch like 4 zones from 10-20. (Westfall, Loch Modan, Darkshore, Westfall)
---
BS
---
Horde is getting ganged too on my PVP server, although the alliance is the minority (Shazzrah EU).
---
If you don't want to be ganged, why did you roll on a PVP server? You should have expected the MASSIVE gang from both sides.
---
I know that I am gonna be downvoted, but that's the truth.
---
Wait I thought people wanted the classic experience.... Been camped for a week is all part of the fun
---
no it isnt as we remember it. I played om Stormscale EU it was one of the biggest servers back then. I never saw anything like this back then. not even close to the griefing trolling and overall supertoxic behaviour. Maybe you are one of those people on the death squads and its fun for you. for the other 99% who tries to level up their characters it sucks cock
---
They do have this in later expansions and other blizz games I think.
---
People are actually more desperate to look smart online. To be the one with the analytic mindset who can decide what is true.
---
Your average PvE realm has a significantly higher % of alliance players than your average PvP realm has % of horde players.
---
You can say whatever you want, use whatever logic you like, but census results across all realms combined have consistently proven you wrong.
---
They are just griefer trolls. 
---
Which is fine I do this shit to, not the exploits but I kill low levels. But that’s exactly what they are doing. 
---
They should just buff the guards. It’s kind of stupid that the Guards are utterly useless. It should at least be slightly challenging to kill other places in cities, currently it’s no more than a minor inconvenience
---
I think you are the Hunter.
---
Maybe play on an RP server, most fun you'll have even just idling around.
---
I was going to roll on a pvp server and then I thought back to my vanilla days of having flight masters camped and being stalked endlessly by rogues and had a moment of clarity.  I am too old for that shit. I am now smooth sailing on a pve realm.  
---
If you haven't realized how petty and immature the wow pvp player base can be, you almost deserve what is happening to you.  Without arena or other end game pvp persuits to chase, some of these people will revert to this type of behavior. 
---
World pvp was never really that fun,  at best being a giant graveyard rush and at worst a one sided gankfest. I'll leave pvp where it belongs, in the battlegrounds, which I am absolutely stoked for.
---
This. If you can’t handle PVP, take your delicate sensibilities to PVE. Period.
---
Or.. hear me out on this. Learn to play
---
How do you set it to percentages?
---
Longshot, but does anyone happen to have ally characters on Pagle and Benediction and would be willing to help me transfer gold to Pagle? (I give you gold on Bene, you give me gold on Pagle, would even do 1.5:1 or something)
---
I rerolled on Pagle cuz I got tired of wpvp, but having no gold or bags sucks
---
Rose tinted goggles wore off?
---
I got a pala at 31. We can probably group up and find some DPS peeps. Dealing with the same issue atm
---
Wtf does Skolde mean?
---
I've always wondered that.
---
Why will horde queues be long?
---
To be fair, 60/40 is balanced compared to places like Heartseeker, which is, 70/30 or 80/20, depending on how much faith you have in census data.
---
Any armor and block your getting from enhance is never going to match the ability to NS chain lightning/ Max rank healing wave
---
It's cool to have and nice vs rogues but extremely situational
---
Ghost wolf is still terribly hard to use effectively in combat
---
Also if you're going enhance you're losing 5% crit and 3% hit and you're going to get shredded by any caster you run against
---
30/0/21 is honestly just the better all around build, it has a use in every fight
---
Its not semantics, its a big difference between all and some.
---
Come on man.
---
My guild has 4 raid grps. Each caters for different time/day raiding and lvl of neckbeard. Also no funneling as core members of each grp have prio over ppl switching for a while. It does require a significant lvl of organization and trust in raid leads but works well once it gets going.
---
R2 actually got 2 hand of rag made by the guild as they got them 1st.
---
Did you get the name right? I can't find it from googling
---
EDIT: found it 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b7ns1r/zephans_warlock_gearsheet
---
Ever heard of stranglethorn?
---
&gt; If PVP is that unbalanced, why would you stay there when you can just create an alt on a non-pvp server to switch to when the ganking gets too bad on your current server. Plenty of ways to play.
---
That's a lot of words to repeat "Why don't you just reroll?"
---
Ganking is always that bad. Ironforge betweent he AH and Bank is safe, but other than that it's only inside dungeons that you get to play - and getting to the dungeons is reserved for people who already hate themselves.
---
&gt; I've been playing retail consistently since BC, maxxed out two retail accounts for alts, and deleted some to make more, multiple times. My two main toons on Classic are still mid-30's. I, too, have 13+ days /played on them, plus a few more hours on some low-level bank alts.
---
Your life story isn't interesting. I'm not you. I *am* playing the game how I enjoy. Blizzard has made that an impossibility so I'm just not paying to "play" their game any more. 
---
&gt; Leveling on a new server is one of my personal favorite parts of the game, and I stopped raiding and even going into dungeons in the past couple of expacs just to be able to slow down and enjoy the game world.
---
I enjoy leveling. I don't enjoy leveling another druid to 60 just so I can get to play a druid in the endgame, which is what I want to do.  Again, neat that you enjoy it, but nobody else needs your life story about that.
---
I think the disconnect after reporting have been in the game since WoD (or even earlier), annoying as hell.
---
I can't believe people are unsubbing instead of rolling pve.  
---
This type of shit happened all the time in vanilla. Quest givers and flight masters might be camped for days.  
---
You want a vanilla pvp server experience? This is the vanilla PvP server experience. 
---
Roll pve and enjoy the game.  Leave PvP to the battlegrounds.
---
Srsly, just play on pve realm. You have signed yourself for this and now u are complaining. Just go to pve and problem solved .
---
Horde player here. My guild and I rerolled about a month ago anticipating this. We’d rather an uphill battle than stomping people who don’t even wanna fight back.
---
“For the Alliance!” or whatever.
---
Fix? It’s not a fix, it’s an alteration. It certainly doesn’t make it better for horde players, since alliance is and has always been very overrepresented in premades. 
---
And no, the idea is not to change things to give a “positive experience”. The goal has always been and always will be to provide an experience as close to the actual vanilla experience as possible, for better or worse.
---
Yeah, Idk why people are so attached to a name. Feels&gt; logic
---
Like I said, DKP just rewards whoever shows up. That's it. You can be awful DPS who dies in the fire and never uses consumes, but still get loot because you showed up.
---
You were just unlucky with the GM, i had the same thing happen and reported through ticket,
---
retry and say clearly you were DCed for reporting through right-click
---
Actually I agree, it's almost like they are doing their best to lose subscribers.
---
This is nothing like Vanilla pvp, if you didnt play back then why speak as if you did ?
---
Not easy pvp, less than 3 vs 1 would be cool though.
---
Nah
---
Just a vicious circle then, because it makes me go on my 60 and troll level 20s for their elders crimes.
---
You should try jumping off the Zeppelin and running through Undercity. The gate and court years are completely unguarded...
---
Seems a little unfair to blame Blizzard when this community was screaming “no changes” day and night. If they fix it, we’re no longer playing Classic. It’s a paradox.
---
&gt;Idk, maybe I'm missing something but horde racials definitely seem better in a purely PvP standpoint. Alliance wins in PvE though with Humans diplomacy, Sword/Mace proficiency, gnomes intellect, etc.
---
It isn't technically a racial but the best PvE racial is Blessing of Salvation. Having even a single paladin can allow your entire raid to effectively do 40% more DPS without pulling threat. Shamans have a comparable totem, but you need a shaman to be in your group so you need 7 shamans to apply it to the entire raid and you're giving up windfury totem for it. It really is astoundingly good.
---
Snowflake
---
Most people I'm finding seem to think it means "Guards!"
---
Pvp happened on a pvp server lmao
---
Interesting. It could also be because of losing player interest.
---
Faction lock when sides get too full
---
Game is dead due to 'PvP'.
---
Open world PvP in WoW was always shit, people just didn't want to admit it. BGs can be fun, but not when it's a PUG vs a premade. 
---
Overall, WoW PvP is rarely fair and therefore typically shite.
---
Roll on a pve server pleb
---
I would subscribe again but only if it would be a PvE server, as for today standards I am no not a PvP type player anymore (unfortunately)
---
Yea I was going to note how hard you’re gimping yourself by not being into ele mastery, since you can still get NS
---
Ofc you are, but it doesn't mean you can never ever tank a raid without it... So saying op should reroll is nuts. Like I said, it's not like the alternatives are level 5 green necks with no stats. Yes he goofed, but he can still play the game and be very good. One less bis item doesn't make all the others worthless.
---
Cool story.
---
STFU
---
I am interested in Shadowlands after 2 expansions break, so I would love to clear Naxx before Shadowlands release. 
---
I understand it's more rushed than original content release speed but to me I'd rather prefer it to be faster: BWL next reset would be awesome.
---
"Facts and logic"?
---
He included PvE and RP servers into the "Alliance dominated servers" then used it to argue PvP servers are balanced.
---
Don't be so willfully ignorant and obtuse.
---
Whitemane has a huge Taiwanese streamer guild on Horde with a full roster. I'm fairly sure none of them even care to use the census addon, so that whole "not everyone is logging their census data" thing probably goes both ways.
---
This was happening back in the day too. We wanted vanilla experience. This is vanilla experience. Just be patient till Battlegrounds will be online. What do you mean by faction balance? Like the players ratio?
---
It won’t, horde will have queues so they’ll keep doing what they’re doing.
---
Nope, just nothing like vanilla.
---
Why is "entitlement" always portrayed as something negative? If you pay for a product, you're entitled to that product. If you don't get the product that was promised, you're entitled to some form of compensation. In such a case, "entitlement" is not a bad thing.
---
Not sure why people think that BGs will fix this issue. The people doing this CANT pvp so they just group up and 10v1 everything. Put them in a fair fight and they will get destroyed. These people are not going to que for BGs they will just continue to camp everything. If Blizzard really wanted to fix this they would suspend all world pvp honor gains until it stops. But they won’t.
---
If you don’t want pvp you shouldn’t have rolled on a pvp server
---
I’m going to explain this once again, the fact that there are a few select changes **does not** justify more changes. 
---
As a side note, no server has 4x the pop of a vanilla server.
---
SS guards are 55 Elites and TM are 40 non-Elite, and that's in a zone with tons of PvP.  It just depends where you're at, but Alliance generally has better guards in more prevalent PvP locations.
---
Portal -&gt; invis pot is also hilarious, you think you see him fade into the portal so you KNOW he ported out. Until he didn't.
---
Unfortunately my friends only want to play on PvP servers so if I want to play there's where I have to be.
---
 R/boneappletea
---
how can i play vs mages as hunter ?
---
basicly they out run me with their epic mounts,they nova,they go on 5 yards distance so i cant mele nor ranged them,and then they burst me
---
You will definitely have your PVP fun from battlegrounds. 
---
People who loved the aspect of PVP of roaming around in a death squad ganking everyone, rolled PVP realms indeed, unless you are likeminded, you haven't missed anything.
---
The knowing everything is a huge difference from vanilla. The whole BiS/pre-BiS lists and requirements weren't a thing like they are now. People had the gear they had, and got invited anyways.
---
I do it as DS/Ruin, saccing the vw. But if everything goes well you can do it even without. 
---
I started doing it as SM/DS at the start and there is a learning curve. At the start, I could do only one run in like 1 hour with a few deaths. But now it is 15-20 mins chill runs.
---
I was levelling very slowly on the PvP server I originally rolled on (still only level 52) as I stopped playing for a few weeks, just due to having stuff going on IRL. Then P2 came along and I knew it wouldn't be worth logging back into the character on the PvP server since it'd be a slaughterhouse everywhere I went.
---
So I just made a new character on a PvE server and I'm having a blast again. It's also fun watching the highly organised PvP going on by Tarren Mill with the level 60s. As a lowbie I can just chill and watch them go at it. 
---
I was worried there wouldn't be a lot of players to group up with while questing on the PvE realm, especially since I picked Horde and PvE realms tend to be more Alliance heavy, but it's been fine so far. Still pretty easy to find groups for dungeons, etc. I think quite a few people have re-rolled to PvE realms to get a break from PvP servers since they seem to be unplayable at the moment based on the posts I see around here.
---
TL;DR: PvE servers are just all around way better at the moment. Plus I can still queue for BGs when they come out if I fancy a bit of PvP.
---
Kotomaru12 for president
---
I was LOS camped in Gadgetzan. Reported it and moved on with my life.
---
&gt;There are more PVP servers than PVE, since the list of the servers is public, you can count the actual ratio yourself.
---
I know the ratio, I was asking **you** to count it. If Horde outnumbers Alliance in PVP servers, Alliance outnumbers Horde in PVE servers and there are PVP than PVE servers, Alliance is outnumbered by the Horde.
---
&gt;However, based on latest census data, aliiance to horde ratio on all classic servers is 52 to 48: based on your username I am looking forward to the data you might present yourself.
---
It's closer to 60:40. I'm still considering whether to present it or not (you can stalk my messages to see the reason). I may do it before Christmas break to gauge how BGs impacted the balance. 
---
It's definitely not 52:48. Or what is your latest census data?
---
It may be one of the reasons. Ofcourse patches/content also fixxes problems in previous patches and people are consuming the content way faster.
---
I wonder how many classic players are even interested in Shadowlands tho. Is classic really a step to Shadowlands or is shadowlands just for retail players who switched to classic temporary? Personally i think i would switch to a non-wow game after classic instead of Shadowlands.
---
sure it is, some GMs have already whispered ppl being on roofs untouchable by guards and handing out warnings
---
So no reliable source.
---
Why don't you get a group of alliance and get on the roof too. If you give up and just report it's never gonna end.
---
I get there is a lot of issues right now but I really thought I'd see more "horde were camping so me and the boys grouped and got reinforcements to try to take them down" rather than seeing so much "I can't do regular content and getting killed is annoying". You aren't supposed to be able to do regular content. You gotta wipe em out first. Win back your shit.
---
(That being said if horde swarm in and outnumber everyone, I get that. But if it's a few people and no one fights back, I mean comon)
---
The thin line between LGF and LFM !
---
What server and side are you on?
---
I’d highly recommend you don’t level as holy, it will be slow and hard. Shadow priest is one of the easiest classes to level after you get spirit tap and wand spec at 20. You can comfortably heal any 5 man content up to about lvl 55 as shadow anyway so most people swap to holy then and start to collect holy gear in the 50+ dungeons.
---
The problem is not that he won't reserve the leaf for you, but that he is willing to reserve items for himself but not for his other guild members (assuming he reserved that 2h sword for himself). Does he reserve for other guild members? You should decide for yourself whether or not you can tolerate that double standard.
---
My guild has fixed prices on items, and priority based on who has the most DKP.
---
At the same time, when BWL hits DKP will be greatly reduced for everyone in my current guild so then it may not be much of a problem anymore. But currently I think I'm like 8th in line for something like mageblade, that's the kind of thing that makes me look for alternatives. But perhaps that's just me being petty? Perhaps if I want to be in it for the long game I would do well just staying here?
---
Okay but how would he get all this sob karma?
---
I literally said what he used that large amount of gold for in the post you replied to. Someone else wins a piece of loot he wants in raid, he whispers "hey, I'll give you 2k gold for that", they go for it, and then rinse and repeat.
---
Are DHKs that easily avoided? I'd be so worried about an accidental kill on a civilian.
---
You hurt him in the booty hole... Man was he offended.
---
Stop with this stupid comment.
---
It’s not pvp when servers are super unbalanced.
---
No changes indeed. Lets cap servers at 3k people.
---
I don't know what the cap is now but it's at least twice that.
---
Not a question, just some advice: BRD is huge, and has mobs within a 10+ level range. If you're willing to venture there, please advertise which bosses you are after when LFG or LFM. I've seen too many groups with lowbies for the second half, while it's nigh impossible to get groups going for prison runs which should be appropriate for level 52...
---
I /who in Ungoro the other day, not the most popular zone I know, me and one other dude in the whole zone. I saw at least 15 horde coming down from the FP.
---
Can tell who all the horde players are in the comments on horde dominated servers
---
Yeah, it only turns into mail and plate items.
---
Not like they don’t have months to fill those seats.
---
Wait, I know it makes sense, but... people just asked for wall walking guards :o
---
This. The answer could help someone find you.
---
on my first character it took 3 or 4 full clears of the cave to get it
---
on my second character I got it in under 10 kills
---
I’ve been saying the same thing for weeks and players seem very adamant that griefing is a great way to have fun.
---
So yeah, our community if saturated with assholes.
---
I keep hearing this "classic raiding is easy" meme and im really not so sure its true.
---
Im standing to bet that even BWL will fuck over many guilds and honestly that place is mechanically fairly simple.
---
Aq40 and especially naxx will fuck over alot of "casuals".
---
Obviously MC is an absolute joke
---
I was trapped in the lvl 20 range for months because of being camped in south shore, darkshore, wetlands. The being camped did not improve after that. It didn't help that I really only had a few hours every night to play then but it was the same thing I am reading about happening now. If you want to actually level in peace then the only way to go is pve servers.
---
I've all but given up leveling my warrior. It's already hard enough trying to kill 1 or 2 mobs, but Un'goro is horde camped, Searing Gorge is a death sentence, and i don't know of any other lvl 50 zones to quest in that won't be filled with honor campers.
---
I think its paranoia
---
Let's wait and see though if they lose enough subs because of this clusterfuck to start shoving out new content
---
Or maybe we're the same people that tried to warn others and then got told to fuck off because it's not going to be so bad. 
---
If anything I expected it to be even worse and I still rolled on a pvp server while not really interested in pvp.
---
And the fact that there **are** changes makes "no changes" idiotic when it's clearly "some things we will change and others we will not".
---
"No changes" *only* works as a reason if there are literally no changes at all. That's not the case, there are plenty, for a variety of reasons.
---
I believe you mean:
---
“You can check out anytime you like,  
---
But you can never leave.”
---
The first days I played the game, I couldn't find the exit of tauren starting zone so I assumed my account was stuck in some kind of tutorial mode. I eventually found the exit of dwarf zone and played alliance for 2 years because of that
---
My guild also let Pugs roll on loot when we needed them early on. Ended up recruiting a lot of pugs.
---
I've not seen a single person ever claim that.
---
Only people sarcastically saying it, like you are here.
---
Most servers with Imbalance wouldn’t be this way if like 40% of alliance players didn’t take those free transfers...a lot of people hated the long que times but now have created an even bigger problem. “But it’s the hordes fault” grow up kid, people ran away from a challenge to get ez mode. Alliance do this same shit on servers they overpopulate. It just has to do with numbers, not which faction is the biggest dick
---
Flamelash Horde
---
/r/ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM wow classic style
---
When you see them coming use fap potions or whatever one it is for nova cc I forget. Then iron grenade stun then, scatter, trap, aimed shot beat down. Also use feign to drop targeting if they cast poly or max rank frost bolt
---
A small bg like wsg will effectively be made much harder, because it's near impossible to sneak past a team is SPY users.
---
I don’t want to play on a server where I can’t pvp. It’s either pvp or quitting, and I just quit because blizzard does nothing or am too slow to fix pvp possible for alliance.
---
Because if you’re not PvPing that’s 50% of the games content gone. Raids are just internet dragons and number logs.
---
You wanted the Classic experience and now you have it. Stop complaining.
---
It was always this way, but the power imbalance between average players and people who play 8 hours per day is a massive difference, so they are allowed to lord their power over us with minimal regulation.
---
Except you have every aspect that the product promised, every feature. Numerical hiccups happen, and in this case you are promised a bug fix for the $15 a month. Saying that it made the game “unplayable” or they somehow owe you $15, despite you still being able to log on and play the game (which is what you paid for) is entitlement at its finest. Saying you wasted a full “month” of game time because of a (from what I’m understanding) visual bug is entitlement.
---
You can definitely vote with your wallet if you feel like they don’t deserve your $15, but they do not owe you a refund for the last month that you have been actively playing. It’s like eating 90% of a McDonald’s sandwich and then demanding a refund because you didn’t like it.
---
They have given these refunds in the past, when the game was literally unplayable and you couldn’t log on. This is not one of those cases.
---
Remember the people here telling all the new people that if they don’t roll in pvp then “they won’t get the true vanilla experience” 
---
That’s because survival is secretly the best spec for ranged too. Now hush up before everyone else gets wise.
---
On the bigger PvP servers it is because of Alliance transferring out to new servers back in P1 so we were left with a lot of 70/30 (or worse) Horde/Alliance servers.   
---
That’s basically why Heartseeker, is 70/30 in favor of Alliance, it’s made up of Alliance refugees that transferred off of the big PvP servers.
---
The issue is gonna be people not wanting to take new blue geared 60s to bwl. Find a guild now and get friendly with them and you’re more likely to get fed mc gear if you can get to 60 a few weeks before bwl comes out.
---
A) if they offered transfers off these realms I think people would take it.
---
B) this is not pvp anymore. Took me 20 runs to get to BRD yesterday. By the time groups actually get to the instance they’re so demoralized they legit just leave the group and log off. Unless you experience this on the daily and it takes you 40-50 minutes just to start playing the game, your opinion doesn’t mean anything.
---
As someone on Grob world PvP is still a clusterfuck. There is plenty of LFG and population, but still dont expect to walk into BRM without dying 5 times

---
Skinning and mining or herbing is way better imo
---
&gt;in death explanation
---
They're just level 48-59 on a pvp realm.
---
I don’t want to be a human, a midget gnome or dwarf the only cool race is night elf but elf’s are over played. Sometimes it’s fun to be bad guys lol.
---
People used to do this on private servers because bg queues were dead and it was the only way to encourage some world pvp. However in classic there is very active pvp all day every day in higher level zones where they would actually be rewarded with honor. 
---
This to me is just griefing or better said they’re being dicks.
---
They have no need to be there doing this when they can just go to winter spring or SG for example.
---
Also, using a roof to avoid guards is punishable. Make sure you respond to the gm when they contact you.
---
We're talking about a spaghetti-code backport of a 15 year old game into a modern client.
---
Blizz can't just change 1 line of code and fix everything instantly. It's infinitely more complex than that.
---
Just because things aren't fixed **NOW NOW NOW RIGHT NOW**, doesn't mean there's a "lack of support".
---
Hunters are monsters in bgs if played correctly
---
Allowing PvE transfers is the first step to killing a server. If your server is already faction imbalances, what do you expect to happen if they allow PvE transfers? Many of the minority faction leave instantly, which causes more people to leave as they have lost friends/allies which then causes the majority faction members to leave as it's not fun to be a raid chasing the 1 or 2 minority faction members left on the server.
---
If you think flight-camping kills servers, just wait till you see PvP-&gt;PvE transfers lol
---
And how do they fix unbalanced factions in classic ? You’re so smart you must have an amazing fix lines up right ? 
---
It’s not a stupid comment it’s the exact thing YOU as the player sign up for when rolling on a pvp server .
---
Faction imbalance will always be a thing if you don’t want horde camping you roll on a pve server
---
Fair point
---
Damn... getting so aggressive and hostile with everyone. Calm down no need to be a cunt just cause you are upset you misread.
---
imagine you need 10days played to hit 60 on one server.
---
on a different server you only need 3-5 because npcs give a different amount of exp.
---
nochanges people will see this, think "thats a different server than the original, you completely changed my gameplay"
---
people who dont care as much about the game will say " just be glad you are not sitting in que for an hour, be glad you dont have to level as much.." etc.
---
thats prettymuch the argument with layering/ changes.
---
There is just twice the ammount of people on the servers, so everything happens 2x, even the cunts and lowbie ganking
---
At this point it think it's safe to say that horde are statistically worse human beings than alliance..
---
Once retail adds more content classic servers will die down in pop i don’t want to be stuck on a dead server in a year that you can transfer off of.
---
wrong.  many people lost honor week 1 from 3-8 am server time, myself included.
---
After a second look, the space between each loot isn’t the same and it feel fake. Don’t you think ? If its not fake, I’m very happy for them but....”I don’t know Rick.....”
---
At this point it sounds like all PvP servers should just be converted into PvE server rules.
---
The only people not happy about it would would be the miserable cunts that are currently ruining a good thing for everybody.
---
Addon called honorspy
---
Don't worry they'll open it very soon if it  starts costing them moneyz.
---
Sounds like vanilla. That’s classic.
---
If you report roof camping players for cheating and write what exactly they are doing in the report button, blizzard is actually pretty fast to get them removed. They do not meddle with these people.
---
While you are there, tell the other people around you what I just told you and your stupid Horde will be gone from the rooftops soon.
---
But he has a job and obligations but he wants loot pinatas to rain on him too.
---
This is such a short sighted comment lol...
---
&gt; I highly recommend a transfer to a PVE server because it’s the experience I think many of you are looking for.
---
By transfer, you must mean reroll. PvP players can't transfer to PvE realms.
---
I'm mildly jealous you get to kill them, because Yang Gang are absolute cancerous trash on horde side. Please, kill these idiots as much as you can.
---
&gt;\#NoChanges
---
These complaints are a RESULT of changes: elevated population caps.
---
Til you die!
---
I’m actually surprised this isn’t happening.
---
Druids have a Boomkins for spell crit)
---
Doubt you even have a level 60 go back to destiny
---
Running herbalism and mining on my alt, too. Basically, I have find herbs on 80% of the time and only toggle mining when a) approaching mountains or map borders or b) actively try to find ores in an area. 
---
Reason being that herbs spawn everywhere and ores are limited in their spawning area
---
Or you know, do UBRS LBRS Scholo, Strat and DM once you hit 57-58
---
There’s a reason that the game changes every year or so with an expansion, and why changes in retail are done every week through maintenance and bug patching.
---
It’s because vanilla wow sucks DIIIIIIICK
---
I don’t experience this daily because I wasn’t dumb enough to make my primary toon on a PVP server, knowing I’d regret it.
---
Have you tried getting better at the game? ;)
---
You can add /startattack to a macro that will auto attack on click.  So if you do /startattack /cast Heroic Strike.. This will auto attack for you and if you have rage use HS.. Otherwise if you don't have the rage it'll still just use your auto attack.. The HS part can be changed to anything. Like MS or something.  Or have multiple abilities setup as macros with /startattack in them.
---
I see a lot of guild doing straight rolls with some limits like one item unless something drops for your class everyone else has or one weapon one armor limit. I see pugs all the time with straight rolls on my server but yours could be different
---
Safe spotting is an exploit. The fuck you laughing about
---
You do realize youll run out of quests at lvl 57 and will have to grind dungeons anyways tho
---
WoW is an old man’s game in 2019. Kids are more interested in shooters and esport-style games, and a lot of this game’s draw, especially in Classic’s case, are nostalgia and inertia. I would think that the average age of WoW players is likely higher than it was in the original run of Vanilla, including mainly players who’ve been playing it for all or most of the game’s life.
---
PvP server players: haha you like pve servers? CAREBEAR CAREBEAR LOL CAREBEAR
---
also PvP server players: wahh wahh gankers wpvp, game is unplayable wahhhhh blizz fix it plsssss :((((((
---
We pop the buffs on Cooldown. We pop one at 1245 so its ready for our raid at 1845 again. We have a discord with all the big Alliance guilds to coordinate that.
---
Go outside and talk with real people and maybe they'll get bored.
---
Blizzard certainly does not want a fractured player base and will look at ways to bring classic players into the retail Dev stream. This is why it is unlikely Classic+ would be considered.
---
That is legit the first Boomkin I saw in the totality of classic wow. What a sight.
---
Bahahaha! That’s the silliest thing I’ve ever heard. Rabbits foot? Ridiculous! Everyone knows that you only keep a [Lucky Charm] in your bags to increase your loot chances. I have it on good authority. That one rogue on the zep who sold it to me for 5g swears by it.
---
I wish there was a way to force faction display on threads. Would be interesting to see the faction of the people saying "reroll carebear or git gud."
---
As Alliance you won't have much waiting time, so that won't be a thing.
---
are they taken to premades?
---
Maybe do some research my man
---
Explains the 30+ people in the raid: they need to bring 2 extra to make up for the moonkin :D
---
You can't queue as a group for AV.  But that means you will have to travel to places like this, which are a long way from the UC.
---
Depends on the zone dramaqueen
---
If you don’t mind tanking it’s usually not hard to get a group going especially if you find a healer. Just use all the chat channels
---
Faction specific queue is a fantastic idea.
---
Whats an example of an awful name
---
I've raided with my DM farm spec and still smacked along fine. It's a bit of a damage hit but not as big as you think. 
---
I was respecing every week previously but MC is such a farm now it doesn't matter.
---
It will fix literally *every* zone being a camp fest.
---
They were very generous.  This week due to holidays we pugged a few slots.  They were allowed to roll on all tier gear but not weapons.  I think all 3 got like 2 pieces each of tier gear but there would be no chance of them getting weapons.
---
I dont know if this will help you understand better
---

---
The domination number is for faction A, obviously
---
You can clearly see that the graph do not have a linear progression
---
As for my calculations in this example, here are the calculations
---
https://imgur.com/a/2nDq9rg
---
if you are unfamiliar with coding i can give you quick explanation as well;
---
First i set N to any number, its basically a static number to see how ratio changes for the % of players in the other faction
---
I then set a variable n, n includes all whole numbers between 1 and 20000, so that each point will be represented in the graph
---
The ratio calculation is straight forward, take the ratio for every single point. The ratio is how many players of faction B there is, per player in faction A.
---
The domination number is simply the % of players in faction B compared to the total population, thus R/(R+1)
---
Now, with this graph in mind we can see that the graph is NOT linear by any means. Your calculations are simply, too simple without any consideration what so ever.
---
Rather, they will still get rewards in the open world, but grinding it out in bgs is going to be vastly more efficient.
---
He has no rebuttal so laughing is a way for him to try and save what little face he has left maybe?
---
Oh wow I wasn’t aware of that! In which case that really bums me out because I’m guessing the reverse is true too in the event of things balancing out many months from now
---
Luckily the slippery slope is a fallacy, proven by the fact that blizzard does not make changes with the motivation “we’ve already changed other stuff”
---
The "honor" system is utter garbage and has been since 2005. It's some of the most terrible behavior altering game design I've ever seen, and I've been playing games for 35 years.
---
As you said, if the horde actually cared enough to work with the alliance, they would just post mats into the neutral auction house to get things going.
---
Your idea of having somebody buy another WoW account and then have them level a character to 60 on the opposite favtion just to make AQ open marginally quicker is hilarious though.
---
There are alliance that are just as toxic as OP's pic.
---
It’s never taken 10 deaths to get from Thorium Point to inside of  Blackrock Mountain until phase 2 of Classic WoW.
---
There's always the rope
---
You’re actually so fucking dumb. Yikes.
---
They're not unbalanced on every server. Smolderweb, for example, is the opposite. Alliance roam the lands in gank squads picking off horde. You just don't hear horde cry about it like the alliance players seem to be doing.
---
Well that sure took a turn
---
Come and play on my server as alliance and see how good you are.
---
Add Every Man for Himself to humans.
---
Let me guess you are one of the whiny alliance that does not realize how present their own faction actually is?
---
The coolest man.
---
And songflower
---
&gt; I know activision; they would purposely nerf the drop rates for thorium and not say anything.
---
Yeah man they're just trying to be mean and get as much profit as they can out of us.  They nerfed the arcane crystal drop rate because they want you to go back to retail and partake in some of their numerous micro-transaction black Friday deals.  They do this kind of stuff all the time, you can bet that any time you're having a hard time with a drop it's because Blizz/activision specifically removed that item from the mobs loot table to frustrate you so you'll go back to retail for sweet micro-transaction goodness.
---
&gt; It’s cross realm and possibly even across PvE/PvP.
---
That doesnt really matter tho.
---
Every single pvp server is largely horde dominated. 
---
Horde outnumber ally greatly, period. So if you play on a more balanced servers you're just getting fucked over by the massive imbalance on other servers. Herod, Faerilina is an example of two massive servers on NA region where the faction imbalance is absurd. We're talking 30-70 at lvl 60. This is two of the largest servers. Similarly with EU, you have massive servers like firemaw (one of the largest servers in the region) where literally everyone play horde. 
---
If it is across PvE/PvP that makes it a little bit better, since there are some Pve servers with more ally players (aside from that literally every single server is horde dominated). 
---
Anyway the large majority of players in classic play on pvp servers. As a whole Classic is heavily horde favored. People that play on pvp servers are probably more into pvp and bg's (pvp servers are massively horde dominated by the way). Even if BG's are cross pvp/pve this doesn't help much with queue times. Horde is waiting 60min q's for sure.
---
Indeed. I don't even get it, the only thing they can possibly get out of this is a perceived sense of power. Before WoW Classic, I have played on private servers for years, all of them pvp servers, and never attacked someone my level who was questing / fighting a mob, even less so someone below my level. I sometimes helped players of the opposite faction with their respective quests or mobs because I know I would have appreciated the help myself if I had been in their place.
---
&gt; It’s utterly pointless to use heavy consumables to clear a raid a few minutes faster, when it requires hours of people’s time to do so.
---
Time that other people set a requirement for, and that other people then voluntarily chose to commit.  You keep on saying 'that's there business', but you then go on to disparage them for for their own personal goals and requirements.  Maybe your notions of casual minimum effort raids are stupid to them, but I don't see them putting you on blast for your 'stupid ideas' and 'lack of respect for other's time and intentions'.
---
or maybe....this is just a game to us and we put our real energy into our lives, families and work. Just a thought.....
---
left for PvE after reaching 50, now enjoying fishing ,exploration, gearing... pve is a proper role play game. let griefers punish themselves.
---
Who said that was their reasoning? Changes are made when things need to be changed, not because other things were changed.
---
All they had to do is fix world defenses for this phase. But they don't care.
---
just throw a grenade before you vanish against lots of mobs, or this will happen yeah
---
I'm a warlock
---
Pretty sure the backend calculations for RP are different than the scripts they use to populate the honor tab.
---
From experience on EU servers that's not the case. LFM could always mean 1-X members.
---
Doe I think shadowlands will bring some people back 
---
At least for the first raid
---
Yeah, there is RP-PVP too for example!
---
Because you called us stupid as crap. My point is that when it comes to video games, yeah I and many like me are stupid noobs because we put our time and energy into real life. So yeah that makes us stupid as crap if we don't know every detail of a game.
---
Nothing stopping you from getting guildies to counter attack. Its what we do in Thalnos when Alliance gank squads are roaming zones.
---
Exactly.  Tank may have messed up there, but the DPS didn't do themselves any favors either.
---
&gt;if you are not rabidly hating Blizzard, you are an "apologist"
---
Nice.
---
But I can't do that solo.
---
PvP on a PvP server? You don't say....
---
Blizzard has a solution, play pve.
---
Nice meme you got there. Would be a shame if it got rule 7'd though.
---
In my experience people using LFG are actually looking for a group.
---
Apparently I died 14 times.
---
If you’re serious, call your bank and ask them to reverse the charge
---
Smaller weeb population in the EU
---
yeah because people on EU servers are entirely dishonest and have the average EU player has the same amount of self respect and common decency as a street whore
---
Good advice. Also if you're going to last boss make sure you're clear at the start of the group if you're killing Princess for loot or not killing her to complete the quest. 
---
A couple days ago I was tanking and my group got in a big fight in the throne room because someone started describing how to do the fight without killing her. It hadn't been discussed before that.
---
Personal opinion. It's a fantasy game and spending your time as different flavors of a human feels unimaginative.
---
In my experience most people use LFM if they already have members or they want to start a group. People using LFG want to be included in an existing group and/or don't want to be the one looking for further members.
---
Not a chance in hell that i'm touching Retail with a 10-foot pole.
---
Quit your bitching son it’s WORLD of Warcraft. You know what’s not fair? The World.
---
Lok’Tar
---
what happens is you should quit and get a life
---
Getting to brm or dm is tough as alliance since most horde honour farmers seem to just sit outside the instances. Similar in epl. The more balanced ratio means that it’s never too long before an alliance group or raid comes to save the day though so it’s not as bad as most of the stuff you read on here.
---
I think a lot of people just genuinely think the Alliance aesthetics are worse. Human females are cute, but there's not a single other possible character I'd play on Alli side where on Horde I have a few more. Honestly if they hadn't gone so weird with night elf between wc3 and wow they'd be more acceptable. Dwarf and Gnome are an obvious no-go.
---
They tell you to PvE because you think you're tough but you cry.
---
First off I would like to say classic isn't rushed. The community is clearing content at a much quicker pace and leaving it without a new phase would lead to people quitting because of lack of content. If you look at vanilla it took the average player 3 months to reach 60, the average player now only takes 1 month. Basically everything appears to be at what would be a logical rate based on a large % of the playerbase clearing content.
---
HOWEVER....
---
Someone (one of the devs) talked about this in an interview with shareholders.
---
Basically their plan going forward is to release retail expansion on even years, so 2020 being shadowlands and release "classic expansions" on odd years. Basically using it as filler to supplement the normal fall they see in subs after about a year of a retail expansion.
---
So
---
2020 Shadowlands&gt; 2021 Burning Crusades&gt; 2022 X retail expansion&gt; 2023 WoTLK etc.
---
I just found that kids wanted to play as gnomes and night elves. So I feel there is a bit more mature player base Horde  side.
---
Priest can relate from shadow word: death
---
Lol. I assume that guild is probably clearing 3 bosses a week. Most hardcore guilds know this phase is a joke and it is used to just farm gold.
---
not just the wow community, our whole society is full of them
---
Here is roughly what my spec looked like as I leveled, I went daggers all the way. It helps to get a nice slow main hand dagger for the ambush, but then use a macro to switch to sinister strike with a even slower main hand like a sword.
---

---
Once you get to 48 I assume you won't be leveling outside dungeons due to honour farming, so consider switching to a dungeon spec.
---
Live strat lf4m need tank and healer all orbs on reserve.
---
Cause horde has all the cool races
---
oh ok. youre part of the reason the game turned into retail so why you even here?
---
You’re calling for blizzard to fix their game but what that rogue did was perfectly normal and not a bannable offense lmao. You guys cry so much.
---
It's because alliance races are boring af, night elves are cool but when I load into a fantasy mmorpg why in the world would I play a human, short human, or short bearded human? I am a human irl seems really lame to me.
---
this shit is so dumb, not even fun or getting any honor from it.. literally a time waste
---
Heal here. Just Go Deep Prot or At least Rock a shield and your heal dont have to drink after every pull because you take so much dmg. You will be a Lot faster.
---
This has to be like the 50th time I’ve seen this post since classic re launched
---
Do you find Imp Aspect to actually be worth it? Maybe i'm biased in my observations, but most of the time when it activated was at the end of pack pulls or just as a boss was dying. It just felt utterly useless to me.
---
Hillsbrad is the designated PvP area anyway. Non-leveling players have no reason to go there apart from PvPing, a opposed to Menethil Harbor, which is the closest entry point to Kalimdor for most Alliance players. That's why it's a problem when Menethil is camped.
---
Besides, guards in SS and TM aren't as relevant because raids rarely go into the towns themselves due to dishonorable kills.
---
I once had that bug, that 3 elite dwarves from blackrock followed me until i reached red ridge. We grew so close on our journey, that i named them tick, trick and track ....
---
Before i finally killed em.
---
I thought exclamation mark in macros was supposed to always toggle the spell on? Yet when I do this
---
    /cast !Shoot
---
and mash the macro, it keeps toggling wand attack on and off.
---
How did they get up on the roof?
---
You're completely right. I'm going back to real life.
---
Alliance hs Paladins and is automatically better in PvE and coordinated PvP (BoP on Mages makes them win big scale fights automatically).
---
Horde racials are only good in small scale PvP
---
It the attitude getting the downvotes not his comments content.
---
Thanks
---
You should probably know how numbers and statistics work before creating such a misleading post.
---
They said that was their reasoning, it’s the red line through every one of the blizzcon classic presentations they made
---
Do note that you can't join the queue from just anywhere in the world, only at the capital cities (and the BG instance location). Queue needs to be longer than 30 min at least. Plus being out in the world means there's a risk you can't accept the queue.
---
&gt; also that everyone needed fire resistance gear
---
That's how we did it back in the day. I didn't chug a gfpp for ony, I threw on every piece of fire resist gear I owned and so did everyone else! No wonder it's a 40 person raid that can be done easily with 20 now.
---
Oh, Keyori!
---
If factions were balanced it wouldn't be nearly as big of a deal. I'd say the real blunder was allowing servers to get so skewed, and then allow rounds of transfers, further increasing an already bad ratio
---
Those are all good points which I do agree with, but I'm specifically pointing out how people use "entitlement" as something which is just automatically assumed to be entirely negative. It isn't, and it shouldn't be used as such.
---
good. this game was made for us no lifers and we dont want your kind round here. unless you just shutup and play.
---
killing lowbies is pve, not pvp.
---
The problem isn't the faction balance. Even when you're with the major faction the game is unfun because people doing pvp have nowhere to go except  kill off players seeking pve on their way to dungeons. I joined a pvp realm cos i like 1v1 or raidvraid pvp, I don't like dying and getting camped by the same group of players everytime i want to do something pve. Spending 1hr waiting just to start a BRD run is bullshit, just because players can't reach the dungeon. I don't have that kind of time to waste any more.
---
Well, until you are dotted and mind controlled off the boat so you have to spend 10 minutes corpse running into the middle of the ocean just to swim back to the boat and have it happen again.
---
What do you mean "full honor"?
---
IDK, but I know overall faction populations are about the same when you pool PVE and PVP servers together.  If it's just PVE it's super alliance biased and PVP super horde biased.
---
Most of my friends and guildies would quit on the spot. Hordes in general seem to have very low morale standards. Pair that with huge numbers advantage and you just have daily rapes everywhere at all times
---
Nerf Horde racials and add a faction login queue.
---
DKs are an immediate percentage reduction of your rank. The higher rank you are the more honour you will have to grind to compensate for a DK. The DK penalty afaik also increases each time you get one that day. This means the second DK that day will decrease your rank by a lot more than the first.
---
Posting a screenshot of one DK at rank 4 is just going to lull people into a false sense of security.
---
Pagle if you are Alliance, Mankrik if you want to play Horde. Those 2 servers are active with 0 queue, can't say the same for the lower pop PvE servers like Westfall / Ashkandi / Windseeker. 
---
If you want a long healthy server experience pick Pagle / Mankrik.
---
Distract doesn't aggro guards? Are there other abilities that can be used as pseudo PVP without aggroing guards?
---
Reported for what?
---
Does the mind control cap not also aggro guards to yourself, the caster?
---
I'm not going to play retail anyway so good luck getting me to play that trash.
---
yah seems pretty obvious thats what they are doing lol.  Quit that guild and spread the word to the rest of raid 2.  With the amount of people quitting you guys should be able to find a guild that doesnt pull that shit
---
You only listed your head and legs.
---
Except I have gotten ganked on the menethil/theramore docks like 6 inches away from guards without them noticing/more guards spawning. It's actually ridiculous how useless guards are. 
---
Quest hubs are shitty for alliance too. Try turning in a quest in searing gorge it burning steppes... and I actually like reading the logs which is even more impossible now. I don't even mind getting killed when questing, I just wanna be able to turn the damn things in when I finish them...

I like to in order to make phase 2 easier on the healers b/c we run with very few of them and I'm a nice guy like that.

World of Roguecraft bro
---
The teabagging I receive would contest your theory haha
---
One of the unique things about classic is that not every class and spec has an answer for other classes and specs.  To get distance on them after the nova you'll need to take a free action potion, or trinket (if you can trinket the snare - not sure if you can).  You can also scatter shot to kill some time before the nova releases you, but you're going to be slowed still.  The key is not to let them get inside in the first place, if they do then it's an up-hill battle.
---
&gt;  any tips on where to level now without being camped by 60s?
---
PvE servers?
---
I think pve to pvp transfers have always been frowned upon since you could level without fear and farm end game items and gold without hinderance as well.
---
3 months? Maybe more.
---
Basic buyer beware mentality
---
I remember getting hate for choosing a PvE server (it's my first walkthrough aswell). LOL!
---
Still loving the game just wait for realm switch problem solved ezpz.
---
that only works if it ISNT actually a massive amount of sunk cost. especially in a game like wow.
---
Don't be such an idiot.
---
&gt;It makes perfect sense for them to just hire a very small team of devs and support, and really restrict all inttervention/interactions with players.
---
In the short term.
---
The difference between that and tanks offering tanking services is that the tanks don't need anything from those dungeons (or at least shouldn't if they charge for it). Also tanks are somewhat rare compared to the demand for them.
---
If you don't need anything from the dungeon anyways but they LF a dps for ages, sure try selling them your services.
---
usually until some sweaty neckbeared tries to validate his self rightous believes via stalking previews posts
---
guess its time again
---
I notice that sometimes they stop chasing if you stop running.
---
Sometimes.
---
Classic was amazing up until honor realese, complete shit show now as alliance... Went to redridge to quest get ganked imidiatly by a 60... When i finaly get there they have killed all The npc... Been able to get from lvl 30-31 in 6 days now and have been ganked 25 hours out of the 30 i played this week. Needless to say i AM not renewing my subscription.
---
Honestly ZG is a kinda raid you really don't want to try 10manning or some shit. It's not MC
---
Leave the guild asap.
---
all the dev's will say is, "what? this is what classic was like. KEKW." and its true. happens to us horde too
---
The reason it used to is once a player was in combat log range, any buffs they had active on them previous would show as being cast on them, so Spy could detect it.  Since nearly every class had some form of buff at all times, it would beep basically 100% of the time.
---
Now, you can't detect buffs without using detect magic (this was part of the fix).  So only new spells cast will cause it to beep.  So if you get in the new, shorter range and cast any spell or do anything that would show up on a cast bar, it will beep.  But if you don't use any items, abilities, etc, it won't.

---
The reality is the only people who complain are those who bandwagoned with streamers and rolled on the highest pop PvP servers (plus faction imbalance).
---
As an Alliance on Mankrik, the game couldn't be in a healthier state in my opinion.
---
He was probably being sarcastic
---
Hmm, do i pay for DPS service when getting 3/3 DPS takes 5 seconds, or pay for a Tank which you can sometimes look for for about 5-15 minutes
---
Git gud
---
The worst thing about this statement is i actually think you believe it to be true.
---
The issue that you're faced with is an organized and knowledgeable player base. 
---
Server population has nothing to do with it. 
---
Everyone knows all the secrets. Everyone knows where all the good shit is and where everyone "goes to". 
---
Everyone is more organized than in Vanilla. 
---
It wouldn't matter if the population was Vanilla level or not, you'd still be having these issues.
---
Mobs have a 50% chance to reset once you pop Sweeping Strikes
---
This is the level of gameplay ive come to expect.
---
just the general idea that you couldn't killm a lowbie even if they started fighting first seems wrong, lowbies would able to attack high levels with near impunity, the strat would be to have raids of lvl 47s in brm to freekill 60s on the way to raid
---
I did this for day 1 Southshore battle,once every hour for 4 hours. Results here:

TL:DR 3:2 and it gets worse
---
You are wrong tho, for warlocks right now crit is better than hit (bc hit pieces are shit right now). This changes with better itemization.
---
You got to get them all 48 and make a new post !
---
My favorite part is how you truly believe this is only a problem for one faction.
---
I serve the Soviet Union!
---
Yea, tons of people will try Shadowlands, only to realize that It's still Retail and then go back to Classic
---
Wow someone’s been ganked one too many times it seems
---
In my experience rogues are fairly underplayed.
---
The 29.2% + hit assumes 305 weapon skill, it is different and lower for 300 weapon skill so technically yes it does.
---
I thought they were being released as a bundle
---
The worst are the guards at everlook, one of my guildies got chased half way to felwood and ended up just suiciding
---
&gt; Oh shut the fuck up. Blizzard never said that these servers were so lopsided.
---
Yea, reread my post. I never said that. 
---
You said they fucked up the servers. 
---
I can only assume that you meant how they rolled them out because Blizzard has never released information for who is on what faction.
---
So you can't "fuck something up" that isn't a standard practice to begin with, can you?
---
sorry added the rest now:)
---
Bc 2021? Id be suprised if we'd have naxx by then
---
Get bonebitter at lvl 35, its a great axe from a desolace quest that get you to sm !
---
Your guild leader should reserve the leaf til you get it. Giving it to a pug just means they don't really like the hunter. Not hard to reserve an item. Or... Stop bringing pugs
---
How is anything you said relevant to absolutely anything? You pulled the most convoluted explanation out of your ass and it still doesn’t make much sense.
---
You think you do, but you don’t
---
Mobs will leash back to their original spot after going somewhere around 50 yards without receiving damage from an activated ability (eg. not from thorns/ret aura), so you have to deal damage to them every now and then to keep refreshing their chase and prevent them from evading back.  Mobs in dungeons will chase you for *much* longer a distance, usually to the point where you don't have to worry about damaging them at all until you're ready to aoe.  Most mages will either r1 Arcane Explosion to keep mobs chasing or Cone of Cold, if they need.
---
Tl;dr: Damaging mobs refreshes their chasing distance so they don't reset/evade early.
---
Damn those salty tears
---
You guys missed the humor tag huh?
---
On my server I am able to party with and invite players from three other realms that share our server.
---
All DHKs are the same penalty, a flat % of your current rank.
---
All alliance races are too lifelike to me.  I played alliance for years and my friends rerolled alliance again and I wanted a totally new experience for classic.  Why would I want to play as a human in a fantasy game?
---
How long has your guild been raiding? Any more than 2 weeks of pugging and your guild needs to reevaluate what it’s purpose is because it’s not raiding.
---
Lol why would I reroll 6 different characters, abandon my guild, and spent another 20-30 days played time doing more grinding to get back to where I was? And pay money to do it. Back to OSRS and D3. Suck it nerds. You kill me, I kill your game.
---
I mean, probably not "long" but the queues reflect the imbalance, I've lvled like 6 toons in the Classic AV event and horde queues take like 20~ish mins vs alliance insta-queues (if not 5~ish mins)
---
Honor came way too early.. 
---
Now all non hardcore Allianz players are on different servers or already quit
---
I guess the war is won before it really started😂..
---
And the worst of all.. most players are greedy greedy assholes now, back then it was a fraction of what it is now..
---
It’s taken so far that I get ganked by 2-3 ally’s and the 4-5 horde actually watch you die so they get more honor and don’t even bother a heal, Rez or anything..
---
no classic experience at all :/
---
Griefers losing their precious honor points would be a wonderful bug!
---
Classic experience...
---
I am, but since I had still been playing for 3 days after and have joined for a few raids past week, I doubt I got any ground to stand my refund. But yeah don't feel like booting the game anymore. If it takes you more than 1 hour to get to a dungeon you want to play, it's just become a pvp-only game.
---
Shoul've rolled pve at start of the game, I don't remember the game being like this at all, oh well.
---
Yes it's reasonable, there is plenty of other gear they can get. Tell them they get tranq shot and you already have x tier pieces
---
&gt; I know people are all #nochanges. But
---
It’s unrealistic and counterproductive to endorse such purism à la classic. Truth of the matter is that classic was not a finished game. There are plenty of bugs and unfinished zones...
---
" #Nochanges crowd cant cry about it. " ill have you know im bawling

It can be a tough situation. It's important to do your best not to let them get in range. Give them a multishot and a concussive, and if they dare blink close you hit them with immediately scatter and run for the duration. 
---
But eventually they will probably get close. Here you use insignia on their nova. You can use consumes like a fap that'll make it very easy. If they get a nova off you grenade their casts or FD at the last second, if they waste iceblock then try get a fd trap on them.

---
False, resource gains still show up, so if BoW gives you mana back, that shows up on the combat log
---
Honestly for dungeons if you want to go shieldless you should just go in an arms PvP spec. Get a big slow two hander, open up every pull with a berserker rage and sweeping strikes and then swap to defensive stance. You'll almost definitely be the top dps by a mile while generating excellent AoE threat, you'll just need an overgeared healer. Dual wield Fury Prot is only really good for extremely geared tanks trying to optimize single target threat, which isn't really a dungeon situation at all.
---
The horde player said to report them when in the title it literally says reporting them does nothing. Can no one here read?
---
You are mistaking +hit available gear right now with the stat +hit. +hit as a stat is and will remain highest priority and dps gain up until like AQ equivalent gear BUT hit gear is shit at this tier hence why people opt for other crit and spellpower items. Use any spreadsheet/simulation with current gear available and you will see.
---
Here is some clarity for everyone that OP is neglecting
---
His claim: Horde servers are on average 67:33 dominated while alliance servers are on average 70:30 dominated.
---
Here's some more information, I'm using HIS crappy domination metric, to get these numbers, i use all EU and all NA servers
---
Horde in PvP servers (cutout at 59.9/40.1): 1525.9% over 23 servers
---
Horde in PvP servers (cutout at 54.9/45.1):  2564.4% over 41 servers
---
Horde in PvE servers: 77.2% on Mankrik (the only horde dominated PvE server)
---
Alliance in PvP servers (cutout at 59.9/40.1): 270.2% over 4 servers
---
Alliance in PvP servers (cutout at 54.9/45.1): 438.2% over 7 servers
---
Alliance in PvE servers (cutout at 59.9/40.1): 840.6% over 12 servers
---
Alliance in PvE servers (cutout at 54.9/45.1): 951.3% over 14 servers
---
As everyone expected, @Gankman100 have been leaving out a lot of important data to make his sob story. Congratulations OP!!!
---
Where are these stats coming from? Blizzard doesn't release these.
---
This. Classic is more like a private server than vanilla.
---
He is talking about Mercenary Mode.
---
Retail had problems with long queues so they added  a mode people could opt in to where they'd be transformed into a member of the opposite faction (including racial abilities).
---
The flaws of the game are so apparent but Blizzard can’t keep tweaking it because there’s this hands-off approach they want to maintain. 
---
The most glaring example is the PvP patch. First of all, the entire honour system is just poorly designed. However, modern player knowledge emphasizes these flaws in a major way. It’s not a problem when small portions of the server study the honour system and understand how to farm efficiently. When anyone can watch 50+ youtube videos on the honour system, where to farm, how to farm, it results in all the roaming deathsquads, instance camping and boat camping. 
---
Can you imagine a modern AAA title having this issue? It never would because modern game developers would see the flaws in the system and it would never be designed this way. 
---
If they start “fixing” Classic, they are essentially making a new game slowly over time. My guess is Shadowlands will try to appeal to the Classic audience as much as possible in both content and gameplay style. Additionally, TBC servers with character transfer are 100% happening.
---
I already unsubbed. Modern gaming culture has ruined Classic for me, I think.
---
And yet he had enough talent to either kill the demons or farm enough gold to pay someone to kill the demons to get his bow and staff...  I thought I’d feel better this morning but I’m still pissed.
---
I said it elsewhere and I'll repeat it here. The honour system is fucked. Swarming in groups of 5picking off individuals is lame as fuck. /Ragequit.
---
Btw Everquest is much better come join p99 green!
---
If you die on the boat don't you still end up at your destination? It's not inconvenient at all. If I get on a boat and there's other faction I expect to die and just AFK and end up in booty bay.
---
My comment was more so about the horde player saying to report them when the second sentence of the title literally says reporting them does nothing
---
I had 2 gnome rogue giving me some feedback on this, they both told me it took 2 solid week of grinding and near 600 gold to get it. While “2 week” doesn’t mean the same for everyone. I can’t tell how many time they were playing each day but they were both almost full epic stuff. If it can help... they were heavy players

---
In retail you have ally dominated servers and you have horde dominated servers. (If I am not mistaken). 
---
That's not the case in classic. In classic ally dominated servers barely even exist, and the few that are ally dominated are pve/rp servers where at most they are about even faction balance to maybe 55% ally favored? I highly doubt the most ally favored servers in the game is even 60% ally. 
---
Additionally even if there are medium pop pve servers with 60% alliance players on whatever, you need to keep in mind that this is nothing compared to  massive servers like herod and faerlina. Herod got more than 4 times as many lvl 60 horde's as these med pop ally favored pve servers have players in total... Even if we assume these servers were 100% ally it literally wouldn't even matter because they are so small in population size compared to herod and faerlina. 
---
&gt;The queues are not long.
---
You're just flat out wrong. One of the reasons why q's are not that long on retail is that bg's are set to a time cap and most bg's dont even last that long (25min I think it is?). Assuming there is 2 times as many horde players q'ing than ally players (on retail) you can give ally instant q's and just consistently cycle horde players in and out making them  only have to wait around the average duration of a single BG before getting put in. In Classic BG's can literally last forever. Sure here and there a bg can finish really quickly (like in retail), but it is not uncommon for bg's in classic to go way over what would be considered the time limit in retail. This is a common occurrence in classic. 
---
You're just flat out wrong. With my own eyes I saw cdew, venruki, ziqo, sodapoppin sit 40+min q's on the beta while asmongold and esfand were getting instant q's. At certain hours of the day you would even have to wait an hour+ for bg's if you were horde (while asmon and esfand would be able to do several bg's by then).
---
You obviously don't play retail, or if you do, you are totally oblivious to Mercenary Mode.
---
He's not saying hundreds of hours isn't much, he's saying 8 days is the low end of the spectrum. It doesn't take into account time played at 60.
---
You spawned on top of the other faction and didn't even try to make a long run. No wonder you all complain about about dying 10+ times going into BRM. No idea what you're doing.
---
That’s not even what my comment was about but ok
---
Play rogue, they are nowhere near as overpopulated as mages and warriors.
---
Fuck the alliance.
---
I picked up LW as a secondary profession with mining to make more money during the leveling process. At what point (type of leather) should I start flipping on the AH instead of selling to the vendor? Light and medium don’t sell at all on my server so I have been vending it all. Should I only try and sell rare types of leather instead?
---
Yeah dude, definitely photoshopped the whole thing, even the loot showing up in chat -  oh and don’t forget the guild chat.  Totally doable in 10 seconds.  Anything for karma, right?
---
So he could have died a mere 10 times instead of 14? What a joke.
---
we all gay for thrall have you seen how massive he is in cinematics
---
also alliance is like a lot more popular on pve servers which is ironic because all the good pve racials are on horde side
---
also if you want to look at it from a lore perspective then (forest) trolls were the original inhabitants of azeroth which get killed by, you guess it: night elves, dwarves, humans
---
**so who are truly the monsters in this game????**
---
p.s. you can take a quick glance for yourself what the ratios are like in the different  regions  [https://ironforge.pro/servers?region=us&amp;filter=true](https://ironforge.pro/servers?region=us&amp;filter=true) if it's anything to go by. it's more like almost all high population pvp servers favour horde slightly, while pve servers favour alliance by an incredible margin, you know who are all complaining about pvp in a pvp server right? these ratios shouldn't come to anyone's surprise even if not 100% accurate. i think another decent way to see what the balance is like is seeing what the raid logs for your server say, how many guilds are alliance/horde etc. but those often reflect the same kind of stats.
---
Time to break “no changes.”
---
Add more guards to cities that will attack on roofs.
---
I think for the first 30 seconds after landing at a FP you should count as a Dishonorable Kill.
---
Just need to press it once, it'll keep casting shootm
---
Source on those figures? Blizzard obscures exact player count and live server pop data iirc so not sure where you could have gotten this info
---
Overall alliance is slightly more popular than horde (52-48 iirc) when you include both PVP and PVE servers.
---
They're more popular on PVP servers by alot though, probably a mix of OP racials and a general 'warlike' aesthetic whereas Alliance is more civilized.
---
How about a ship crew?
---
good thing you have such a thick skin, because then you're probably not gonna mind the hours of queue time as horde while ally gets instant pop
---
If it truly was a reskin or retail WoW it would have been much better.
---
A lot of issues could be fixed and adjusted with their tech.
---
Reserving a Leaf, or attempting to recruit hunters with it already, doesn't really make sense to me.
---
It's a 50% drop rate. You'll all get it eventually, and before you know it they'll be going to the vendor. 
---
Additionally, as hunters you have well itemised tier 1 gear, which you will pick up at a quicker rate than many classes (because you probably have more than 6 mages who want their T1 helm, but fewer than 3 hunters, etc).
---
Hunter gearing is simply bottom of the list when it comes to the concern of loot distribution in MC.
---
Raid leaders should be far more concerned with: the gearing of tanks, the distribution of things like Band of Accuria (rare drop and will be worn the whole game), distribution of rare weapons to melee DPS (if you're lucky you get a weapon a week between 15 people who want it), distribution of high drama items like Robe of Volatile Power and Mageblade (because they are both Paladin BiS and big caster upgrades).
---
Similar thing is happening on kargath on Herod. A bunch of ally mages respawn and aoe a few people down. Im ok with this time of farming, no ganking lone players going about their business.
---
There's no point in being civil with someone that thinks this is a "should've rolled on a pve server" problem. This is a problem for everyone but I can't expect you to understand this. Go ahead, camp lowbies and abuse rooftops, you'll get far in life.
---
It's real easy to say that as a horde boi on the roof
---
loooool to all just play the game ey
---
There were times before mercenary mode. Actually more time without than with it.
---
Jesus quit crying. Go play on a PvE server or quit crying about pvp on a pvp server. This is vanilla wow. Get used to it, wait for BGs, or go back to retail.
---
So warlocks are used for there powerful debuffs? If that’s so is there gear that can power up the debuffs?
---
They thought they did, but... you know the rest
---
I disagree with your prediction. BG's still won't fix it. You know why?
---
B/c Blizzard DEVIATED from Vanilla by introducing Naxx/AQ40 quality loot as PvP epics, i.e. 1.12 loot while we are supposed to be in Patch 1.4.
---
Private Servers didn't. The PvP rewards were the earlier patch rewards, not patch 1.12 quality. 
---
Blizzard gave the gankers the perfect excuse to never stop ganking. They are gonna have long queues, so they will HAVE TO continue ganking (because faction honor competition) to make Rank 14 in between BG popups.
---
just play pve, dummy
---
Welcome to Classic 2019
---
Only if you're not at full mana.
---
And Alliance are camping everywhere on my server. Report safe spotters and move along. Otherwise get over it.
---
You should say "Healer LFG &lt;dunegon&gt;"
---
I quit too. Can’t transfer, and don’t want to start over. I don’t care that PvP happened on a PvP server. Just wish it wasn’t horde camping alliance flight paths. 
---
Faction based transfers suck, because I want to xfer to a playable realm so bad.
---
I really hope it’s 60 minutes plus for them.  Insta pop for ally.
---
doesnt matter, its not even comparable. just because people are saying its not hard, doesnt mean that it isnt. its not that relative. "being an astronaut is easy", ok now i can say that since its relative. Argumentation like that is incredibly pointless. It literally makes any discussion about anything useless. So please stop that nonsense.
---
You’re aware we’re discussing a screenshot where the horde are doing it, right? I never said the alliance don’t
---
my favorite: "lfm \[dungeon\] tank, heal, 2dps"
---
*just now realizes server is imbalanced*
---
*regrets*
---
I can't upvote this enough. This behavior wouldn't be as common if there were less people per server. Yes, it would still happen, but there were also likely more GMs per capita to take care of exploiters like this when vanilla was live. Also with less people there would more likely be other places to level when the Horde/Alliance decided to shut down a city.
---
However, I'm not advocating for a smaller cap; that's throwing money at the problem that will lead to queue times, more splintering, and ultimately faster dead realms in the future. A couple guard spawns on the roof would suffice as a deterrent. Yes, they'd be easily beaten back, but there's a reason these clowns are on the roof where they can't reach - the guards on the ground are a deterrent they don't want to deal with. It makes the harassment more of a hassle than some (not all) will think its worth.
---
They ban all the time for this. But people expect ticket response times to be an hour.
---
“Wow classic belongs to all people playing” - yes including people who would enjoy this time of gameplay with competition over sparse resources and pay a subscription fee just like you do. And “wow classic” also has a PVE option designed for people like you. Can you imagine how layering would be exploited with an honor system? It would give min maxers an even bigger advantage. I hate corpse running to BRM 15x too, and there are flaws in the game’s design, but still, we got the game we wanted and your complaints aren’t that helpful.
---
Nah, they release them in timeline order. Reach, 1 , 2, 3, ODST. I don’t know how many time they will be released from each-other but I expect 5 years. 
---
I’m sorry to be the one to tell you that... since its not a bundle, you’ll have to buy them all separately, probably 80$ each.
---
thats the way it always was. wpvp is wild west whacky shit and BGs was structured pvp. and that IS the way us vanilla players want it, tho with the wild west whacky pvp being the only option it does suck. remember that it was only a 6 week period in vanilla where it was only wpvp.
---
Thunder fury is alliance heavy and they camp the shit out of people.
---
I spent levels 52-60 in dungeons.
---
Making me wonder if I need to xfer to an alliance heavy server just to avoid this.  I’m worried in another month there will literally be no one on my server and free transfers will be done
---
I agree with this. Of course it should be considered an "official" response but a matter this serious deserves more attention than a single-line comment without any ETA or anything.
---
In total it's pretty equal 50/50, not horde dominated. Bgs are cross server. Also taking beta as a meassurement, lol.
---
Any serious PvE player will play the shit out of bgs because gear. AV exalted is a must  have.
---
Avs take 6-12 minute on average, this is a lot faster than retail.
---
I’d guess naxx by early mid 2021 and tbc October or end of 2021. 
---
I’d guess p3 in feb 2020. P4 July 2020. P5 dec 2020
---
In 1.12 we had cross realm bgs, so I don't think it will be an issue
---
Don't play on a pvp server, scrub
---
Would gathermate or other addon help me out with this? Do you use any of these?
---
The best part is the blurred names in chat, but untouched over the characters.
---
In my experience, it's because experienced tanks don't want to put scholo. It can be a nightmare in a bad group. What often works if you really need to do it and don't mind a 2 hour run is whispering level 59s or maybe 58s, especially those in EPL.
---
I’m on a pvp server that is alliance heavy and also wonder why all these people who rolled pvp are crying. Like...what did you expect?
---
Perfect deviate scales have a market, but that's all I've notices. Maybe heavy leather for the silk bags and quivers?
---
You got a great sense of observation. Now that you talk about the chat, I hate everything about this picture.
---
What a nuanced and well constructed response
---
False. I used to do this in TBC with friends in the open world in Goldshire, SW gate and Darkshire / Redrige. GM contacted us a few times and manually moved us down when we refused. We never got banned
---
Long instance with trash packs which are punishing but not punishing enough to wipe you if you work hard enough to make up for peoples mistakes. This makes people constantly underestimate the dungeon and give you shit if you try to micromanage their slacker gameplay.
---
A bunch of skippable packs that everyone always wants to skip but somehow always manages to pull anyway.
---
Tightly packed caster packs which are made trivial by los pulls but god forbid the dps hold off for two fucking seconds.
---
Ive done scholo more times than any other dungeon by far and I fucking hate it, and I hate people. Its exhausting.
---
You are fine skipping them. I personally didn't, but I hear a lot of people skip the felhunter one until 60.
---
Please explain how that's ambarassing or makes any sense at all.
---
Jesus the Alliance are the biggest cry babies I've ever seen. Alliance aren't camping Horde lowbies on other servers? You aren't a victim. Dry your tears and get over it.
---
*asking for a friend*
---
A lot of the streamers saying "no changes" didn't even play vanilla. Most of them picked the game up in BC and Wrath...
---
The struggle is real. I’m close to 80 kills on rend with no mh drop, and 60 hoj stealth runs with no luck. All while a hunter in guild got both dal rends and the pain weaver in the same run... on his first ubrs. Shit hurts man
---
 You play 28+ gotta per week and are only level 32? Have you only been playing for one week or something?
---
Herod for one.
---
Thats not true. Regardless of what factions doing it, above actions ARE making alot of the casuals quit the game.
---
Not to get too philosophical, but online gaming has, I think, in the past few years especially, really exacerbated people's selfishness and narcissism. The people doing this do not care if it's bad for the game. It's not even on their radar. They get a cheap laugh and rush of serotonin this moment over it and that's all that matters.
---
HAHAHAHAHA
---
Yes. Yes you can.
---
You do, not bad at rank 4, but in the highest ranks it can mean a week more of nolifing
---
Indeed, butt fuck ‘em.
---
I’m playing alliance this time around but I agree with you! I love the idea of playing as an undead or orc. I love their look, animations, home areas etc..!
---
Thank you kind sir!
---
For tanks, they often will place value on the work they do "in the dungeon" when in reality, the thing that brings value is the thing outside of the dungeon. I.E. the fact I have to spend 5-15 minutes searching. This is what the tank solves by charging for their services. 
---
Being that 5-15 minutes is not a big deal to me, knowing we're playing a game, I am willing to spam trade for 5-15 minutes to get what I want for free. But when a tank comes up and whispers: "Ah I will tank for you for 15-30g + greens" or "all greens" or "10g + the first weapon green" I can only help but laugh at them because none of these are worth anywhere close to the 5-15 minutes of waiting. They place their value on the "dungeon run" not the "15 minutes of waiting" after all, so they charge these exorbitant amounts with a smile on their face.
---
I pvp as alliance at lights hope a lot. I’ve never held it for more than maybe 20 minutes before horde raid comes through and I’m killed at the FP 18/20 times on my way in. Alliance does pvp there but horde still dominates it.
---
Yeah exactly. But then again, how long would a more optimal classic last in the long run?
---
A lot of people would still have eventually quit.
---
So they have the choixe of a non-altered version that has near effort needed for a year, and theb just release TBC to get people back 
---
Vs
---
A more optimal, altered version, that lasts longer, and has gewer people quitting over time, but will cost a lot more resources, and also be a risk. since every change also risks being a bad one.
---
I personally would much more prefer the latter, at least a compromise. They could have done a lot more outside of gameplay itself.
---
If this is incendius, I have screenshots of the first 10 horde up there.
---
Farmed like 8k honor from them last night. They are total trash in world pvp as well. I’m in this video and I appreciate the easy kills tbh
---
and, y'know, objectively the best racials.
---
Like it's not even a question of flavor. If you aren't playing horde, you're actively gimping yourself racial wise.
---
I have leveled both factions to 60 so I do...
---
I’m an idiot and accidentally destroyed linkens sword before completing the huge quest chain (it’s a secret to everybody, starts in Un’Goro). I’m at the part where I have to talk to the ghost near the Gadgetzan graveyard but he doesn’t have a quest to give. Is there any way I can still complete it?
---
The fact that you think its 50/50 H:A across realm makes me discredit everything you say immediately.
---
Play the game and get back to me before you start spitting facts or stupid census numbers that reflect nothing about the current state in game.
---
Guess we'll never know since he didn't try. Seems to me like all the posts in here are of people who gave up. He made that video to prove a point and he just showed he doesn't know how to corpse run. I'm on Horde and usually have to corpse run a couple times. Welcome to pvp
---
I don’t know what you mean with lucky? This was quite comonn before guards were using gryphons / windriders in cities and they could get up on roofs from the ground and shoot you. Some few that got banned were banned for using dc macros to get behind or inside non accesble areas. Roofs was easy to get up on and therfor they never banned you.
---
Nothing, this was the exact same experience in vanilla.   Pretty much vanilla was a gankfest on PvP servers where it was pretty much impossible to progress if you were logged in during primetime hours.     I used to log in late at night if I actually wanted to level up because I would waste more time getting ganked than getting EXP.
---
Now this is REAL REPOSTING!
---
Are all serious EU PVPers on Gehennas EU? I may level a mage alt and want to be on the best server for PVP. My priest is on Noggenfogger and it seems to be like 80/20 Horde:Alliance.
---
The horde storyline has developed to be more interesting than the alliance. Better characters (sylvanis, thrall, rend, etc.) have captured the segment of the playerbase that's playing classic after learning lore from the later expansions. 
---
In vanilla, the alliance was far more popular, everybody wanted to be the good guys and LotR was popular so lots of legolas, gimli, gandalf and aragorns running around.
---
&gt;Other cool thoughts would be Hunters with Stealth from Subtlety
---
Isn't that kind of a thing already in retail? I was watching some arenas a few days ago and a Hunter started the match in stealth.
---
You're not the only person having issues, they probably get 100s of tickets a day for all their games and more, I don't think people being ganked is on their priority list.
---
Except I'm totally not you fucking simpleton.
---
Show me on this doll where the rogue ate you.
---
Paladin tanks always want scholo since Deathbone set is good for them.
---
Warriors wouldn't need much from there, and those who do probably already have it.
---
Druids could use a few pieces from there, but they're quite few.
---
I'd say join a guild. Tanks willing to do 5mans will keep decreasing as the servers get older. But guildies will often do things they don't need for each others' sake.
---
Well I haven't even started raiding so that's all still on the table and on a much longer time scale. The need to consume content quickly is a retail thing. Vanilla had guilds barely scratching MC when Naxx was released. PvP obviously is a loop you can play for years alone.
---
It is kind of counterintuitive, but I do think making all dailies into repeatables solves the main problem.
---
You're not alone
---
The only time I'm able to play and get anything done is when I'm in a group with my friends level 60 characters on Saturdays.  I'm finding it harder to justify giving the 2 hours I have during the week to play a game I cant actually enjoy.
---
ok boomer
---
You should check the server discords
---
Rushed? There isn't enough content to fill 2 hours per week. If anything they're releasing stuff way too slow
---
In vanilla they banned player all the time for this, just like in classic. Either you got lucky in TBC or they applied a different rule with TBC, but you could be ban in vanilla for this.
---
So they can quit charging $15/month for recycled content? No, I think they want to be able to keep doing that.
---
Hi Kathevly. Thank you for the comment. I hear a lot from people that they have bad experiences with prot pallies. Sometimes people leave when they see it's a pally tank. I also experience that people whisper me after a run to tell me that it went much better than they expected, and that they had a great run. It takes hard work and theorycrafting to do it but if you do that, it's doable and often times fun but not perfect though.
---
Awww already recycling spam posta from last night? How green conscious of you!
---
You're delusional. You cant see someone die 14 times to unfair matchups and know that this happens every time they go to BRM and just say "Welcome to pvp". 
---
This isnt a Horde v. Aly thing. It's a majority v. minority. The game is busted. People are quitting or re-rolling PvE en masse.
---
You dont get credit for damage to shields either. Lets face it, the system is super primitive, best to just wait out this silly phase
---
An experience similar to a vanilla wow pvp server. Fairly straightforward
---
lol come to heatseeker
---
And it really was overnight when honor came out.  Ganking went from ‘maybe die at the door to BRD’ to ‘10 deaths to get into any blackrock mountain instance the day that came out.
---
Honor was a mistake.
---
&gt;Only people sarcastically saying it, like you are here.
---
Yeah, that's the joke.
---
You misspelled "Vietnam."
---
Man don’t badmouth drugs like that. They don’t deserve that!
---
Ah yeah and where you take your knowledge from? Pulled everything out of your arse?  
---
Census especially before the nerf is as close to perfect as you will ever get.
---
Well the difference is that this isn't really the old school experience. The server populations are much higher, Blizz even said their low pop realms are larger than a vanilla realm in population. And with such a one way faction balance towards the Horde, the game is unplayable for some. Because there's more Horde than ever before. Even on my realm, which is supposedly fairly balanced, find myself getting ganked by groups of horde sometimes even in the wee hours of the night (4, 5am). I'm level 60, but I can't beat a 1v4.
---
I have tried to farm in WS everyday on herod as alliance and I have experienced the same issues. It's pretty off limits.
---
And locations...and lore....and the best racials...and flight paths....and transport....
---
You cannot have NS and EM at the same time lol you have to pick
---
For the horde
---
For real lol
---
"Literally no alliance exist anymore to even make the polls, therefore that actually means OP is wrong and alliance must be vibrant!"
---
I log on and enjoy the game every day and level in peace and quiet. The real way to play this game is on a PVE server. I love reading threads like this because it assures me I make better decisions than a lot of other people.
---
bro youre posting cringe
---
Usually, go back to where you picked up the quest and there might be an option to get another from the quest giver.  If not, you can abandon and pick back up and get the quest item again.  Last resort, open a ticket.
---
They just need to release and instentivise free server transfers.
---
That's GMs telling you to fuck off...
---
^ Not true. Hover your cursor over Dishonorable Kills in your honor tab; it explains that Multiple DK’s on the SME DAY have an increased effect than the first. This same info can be found using a quick search.
---
As he should.
---
It does not matter. Those tons of ppl will be there for every wow expansion. Every one and that means shitloads of games bought.
---
Lol get over it you baby 👶 🍼
---
Tell your guild to reserve leaf and EoD like literally every other guild put in existence
---
Ugh, that's like when I joined a DM:N run a week or so ago and we get there and everyone's trying to sneak around to make it a Tribute Run and getting annoyed when I didn't know what to do. Like no one mentioned it was a tribute...
---
I know my class can solo tributes but I was a pretty fresh 60 so I hadn't been there yet.
---
IDK about "ban all the time" I've seen like one or two people post that "others" got banned.  I've seen people rooftop camping in tanaris almost every single day I go there.
---
The only thing I've seen is some GM messages saying, get off the roof.
---
Ok I'm not denying that. I'd just like to see a source from that claim.
---
Until then it smells like jabroni to me.
---
Not sure “ass-crease” should be hyphenated here.
---
Well, I remember this from a time when I was much younger...  which is why I rolled on a normal server this time around.  The mechanics are what they are, which is opportunity for improvement, but here’s the catch:
---
Taking an opportunity for improvement costs money.  Right now, their money is being spent elsewhere so in order to improve that mechanic, they would have to take a few dollars out of the shareholders’ pockets.  Not gonna happen until the bite comes from somewhere else.
---
Until the bite comes from dropped subs that are equal or greater than the dev cost to fix, you’re SOL, my friend.
---
Oh it happened to a lot of us. Whole new world and experience with so much to learn that we take for granted now.
---
why would i play a fantasy mmo and play a human? im given the option of badass orcs, trolls, etc
---
Everyone should have been expecting this, as it was obvious: at least for those who initially rolled PVE for the very same reason.
---
Players who rolled alliance on PVP servers not being ready for being honor livestock/guerilla corps during P2 were just clueless despite all the warnings.
---
Blizz will release a fix for this alongside bgs. Please read the forums before whining.
---
I always thought of it as it's cool to be horde because they look bad. Like in high school, being stupid makes you cool and popular. How ozzy got famous after he started doing scary creepy shit. He said it. Most humans are attracted to bad and "scary". Maybe even a reflection of themselves.
---
That's why you will forever be a low rank.
---
They dont do anything about it because they are elsewhere actually earning more then 5 honour per kill, and the only time they do do anything about it, they are heading to raid and totally steamroll through you.
---
Then hire more people. Disrupting gameplay should absolutely be a priority.
---
Fuck off retail dev team
---
And you can argue PVP is just Mindless zerging at current state
---
Yes but that’s what the vanish is for
---
This is how I payed for my first epic mount in vanilla. 
---
Also pick out 2-3 single mobs to pwn solo when your CDs are up. 
---
If you have mining you can also get the dark iron, it sells well.
---
When u roll back 15 years of improvements on a game did you expect it to be playable?
---
This is very sweet!
---
Relatively speaking...... 2 years isn't a long time over a 15 year game.
---
I played PvP prominently in Vanilla TBC and Wotlk and there was nothing stopping premades from queueing against pugs.
---
I've been out of the loop for a while but as far as I remember it's been that way for the majority of my time playing at least.
---
&gt; This is just griefing
---
Yeah that’s probably their goal. Greifing can be fun sometimes.
---
Got HoJ on my 80th kill on Friday. I’ll never level a class that uses it again.
---
Fucking wild, my guild members and me seem to have the best luck, I ran BRD on a whim in a angerforge run, HoJ dropped twice back to back and I won it the second time. MH rend has dropped twice now over the weekend and now we're inviting rogues and warrior pugs who don't have it to our guild jed trinket farms, we're gonna get them their swords.
---
Haven't played Horde forever and regrettably rolled Alliance for Classic, the defeatist mentality thing is real. It's gross.
---
This is the only thing that I'm waiting for right now so I could get back into the game. Hopefully very soon, but no other info yet besides they're planning.
---
As someone who works in software industry this response time is better than most sadly
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hEzzVfMqZZVzez0x  
---
Ns for wpvp ele mast for bg
---
Incendius alliance
---
Hard to say where it started, the reasons could be many. Whether it's that Horde races are more aggressive, the racials, or that most kids rolled Alliance on original release, making an easy target for Horde players. I know i rolled Ally as a kid, and seeing scary monsters with a red symbol next to them can be pretty intimidating/demoralizing.
---
Because here is how it looks from a random customer's prospective... 
---
I rolled on a server and race because my friend rolled on it. It just so happens this servers population is in my races favor through no knowledge or control of my own. (Blizzards doesn't publish the numbers and did nothing to balance this in the beginning) 
---
Blizzard idiotically opens unrestricted realm transfers, and a large number of the opposing faction transfers off, making the server much more imbalanced. 
---
Now the solution to Blizzards previous poor decision is to either block me from playing, or force me to abandon all of the relationships and community I've established and move to a server that is completely unbalanced in the opposite way?
---
Faction specific queues would have made sense from the beginning, along with faction restricted transfers.  Blizzard screwed it up too much, and adding them now will just piss people off.
---
The thing about classic is you can actuallt be decently casual and still enjoy raiding.
---
I play this game strictly for end game now... you can happily raid log and put in mininum time each week
---
I somehow deleted my hearthstone by accident. Friend in high school informed me that once it was gone it was forever gone. So I deleted my human mage and made another one.
---
I'm having flashbacks to 2005 from this thread lol.
---
I played in pvp servers for years in classic and it was a completely different experience back then.
---
Nelf is actually underrated for rogue. I always get the opener vs other stealth classes
---
Horde camps towns for 12+ hours. A GM tells 1 guy "hey stop that this is a warning". Then they wash their hands of the situation. I have seen the same people camping towns for weeks and none of them banned, so I think warnings is the extent of what they are doing.
---
This happened on Heartstriker (DE). We asked who needed what. No mention from him. Left with the comment "sry^^". 
---
I don't care if some rogue or enhancer wins, not some meme spec like feral.
---
Arent they only carrying the flag?
---
popular streamers play horde because it's the faction with the better pvp racials -&gt; their army of 14-18 year old fanboys is highly creative and original and does the same.
---
&gt;hey let’s base the entire wow community of several million people on a single bad person
---
Pve server ftw!!!
---
Thank you for the comment. I have the T1 shoulders and t2 legs. I'm looking forward to see what the other t2 and t1 items does for my tanking when i "hopefully" get those and if I should respect. Right now I have holy 20 and prot 31 wich allows me to get illumination and holy shield
---
What if it *is* balanced, except horde isn't complaining that much? Just a thought.
---
Just wait, they'll backtrack on their: "items earned in Classic won't be added to your retail transmog collection." Once they do that they'll get some bites, after that we'll see promotions like: " Do XXXX in retail/classic, and earn XXXX in retail/classic." 
---
The "no changes" stance is holding strong, but it won't last forever, not with current Blizzard.
---
Both raids are done in under 2 hours.
---
They are horde though, so they have no honor.
---
They made this game the way it was in vanilla, if something is broken, that's intentional code
---
Some say you see what you want to see. I'll have to agree on the amount of rogues though.
---
Sitting in the IF Inn and one shotting lowbies when they hearth with half health... Had to corpse camp a couple rogues doing this on Friday.
---
world buffs and still bottom dps. LUL
---
Since they're using crossrealm bgs I imagine queue times won't be long at all for anyone. Total horde/ally population is fairly even.
---
I mean why waste 30 minutes of your life when you can swap servers or play another game?
---
According to ironforge.pro Herod is a 1.67:1 Horde to Alliance ratio of raiding 60’s. Its imba but not absurd. Faerlina is actually less imbalanced than Herod. The statistics probably aren’t the best to paint the full picture but they are stats none the less. 
---
I play on Heartseeker as Horde so I feel your pain if not worse as we are nearly 3:1, Alliance to Horde. The situation sucks and only Blizzard is to blame.
---
You take more fall damage if you're wearing plate armor.
---
Yeah and let me tell you right now there is not many ways to make cash as a warrior it's not like going out and mining is an option.
---
You're full of shit lol. It's way more than 55%.
---
Thank you for the laugh hahaha
---
This is the laziest attempt at content I've seen in days.
---
People downvoting you are idiots. The guy didn’t even read the title and he just made his comment to garner as many upvotes as possible.
---
classic will be dead by end of 2020
---
Lol y’all didn’t like my joke.
---
Why don't you stop playing?
---
Download Luna Unit Frames. It has the mp5 timer, and HealComms built right into it! It is very easy to customize and looks very sharp.
---
If you are planning on raiding, it would be wise to snag Decursive too for fights that are dispel heavy.
---
Definitely is a strong word. I wouldn't count on anything with bliz
---
Guilty as charged.
---
Wow was released for NA nov 7 november, BG's came June 7. That's 8 months. Or if you want to go with the pre DM patch, then it's 6 months.
---
Probably mad he ran out of alliance to corpse camp and is currently doing the posting version of it.
---
I made and quit a mage alt for this reason.  I enjoy melee dps/tanking much much more.  If you’re new, don’t be afraid to play a couple characters to 10 to figure out what you like!
---
Basically every server has 10+ horde camping on every boat.
---
Feral is more optimal than enchance shammy just a heads up
---
If you're not great at it, you can also make it so your FD comes off cooldown right when the invis pot runs out. If you come out of feign death out of line of sight of the pack at the bottom of the ramp you can stay there for 15 sec while your FD cools down. Pop the pot and run with 15 sec left on FD and even if you aggro the last pack at the end of the invis pot you can feign them off right away.
---
Isn’t AR skewing heavily Alliance? At least ironforge.pro doesn’t show it as balanced.
---
No there totally are and I personally dont tank for money, but all Im saying is that theres no need to get upset over what people advertise for. If you dont like it, don’t take their offer...
---
Look up rogue dps spreadsheets. There’s a good one linked on the rogue discord.
---
Huh? I mean I know it procs but is it that good?
---
If you can grab 2 right off the bat, they each think that the other is your +1 and it all equals out.
---
Do not spread lies. No one gives a shit what happened in TBC. Current CM communication has made it 100% clear that it is again the TOS. How about you stop your fucking bullshit?
---
That's kinda what I'm doing with my paladin. Hes sitting at 49 in iron forge inn raking up that rested. Have leveled a priest to 30 since I parked my paladin.
---
You did need fire resistance in 1.1
---
This is truly a classic experience, I remember this shit happening all the time. Good times.
---
My guess is that this is the data that is being referred to. Its currently at 52/48.
---
https://wowclassicpopulation.com/
---
Did you think classic had no trolls or ninjas?
---
No, you don’t. If you don’t release spirit then you respawn when the loading screen pops up. Then you die again because the horse corpse camp everyone who doesn’t release.
---
I understand your plight....and I hate to say it, that roof has ALWAYS been there and Horde have ALWAYS  done that.
---
So I never used that roof in classic because I was an undead rogue in a pvp guild. We just camped the town, on the ground and murdered everything.
---
I also declared myself the mayor of duskwood.
---
Now I'm a tank warrior and sad :(.
---
Nope
---
Blizzard - if your listening - I'd pay good money to transfer.
---
- sincerely an idiot who rolled on the wrong time zone.
---
Night elf males have hands down the worst animations in the game(especially their casting animations, the 1h melee ones are ok).  I'm big on aesthetics and animations, and horde is where it's at.  All of their races are really unique unlike the alliance.
---
Onys fireball used to conflag the target and did huge damage.
---
Yes, it is BiS till drama fang for alliance and horde.
---
Since horde has that hit trinket you might drop it then if you’re lucky enough to get drama fang and since the quest that Bland Hand comes from also gives the BiS forever mitigation trinket. It’s likely a feral will take that. Also HoJ can proc Omen of clarity. 
---
I’m not saying what this guy did was okay, but what I’m saying is feral is a more viable spec that what you listed and HoJ is BiS for a long time.
---
&gt; First off I would like to say classic isn't rushed.
---
Agree with this at the moment and it's too soon to say that content is rushed. MC and Onyxia was cleared within the first week. Yes this was done by very hardcore players rushing to get first but now casual players clears these raids easy and it can't be compared with the original vanilla. Hopefully when the content gets harder and more align with 1.12 vanilla, content will not be released this quickly but at this point what can Blizzard do? And even later on content will be cleared faster than original Vanilla and probably by more people overall.
---
Also, from EU perspective nothing is rushed at the moment. DM and world bosses was released one month after EU release and the honor system two months after.
---
This man knows what stranglethorn gank is all about
---
You get a whole undead town?
---
What’s funny is on my pve servers there’s a lack of them. So I’m playing one as an alt and really enjoying it.
---
Had a player take a chest I had just cleared. Not really a huge deal but I threw it up in general just like we used to when someone would do stuff like that. Not really looking for sympathy, I always just put those players on my ignore list (the ones being shitty). 
---
I basically got 20 people all rippin into me for literally saying "xxxx is out here taking chests other people cleared".
---
People used to care, they don't anymore. The community isnt interested in anything but e-peening as hard as possible. Which is fine, I guess, wow certainly looks to be designed for that specific purpose.
---
Is that the trucker who has his incredible in-Cabin setup? He posted a picture a couple months ago
---
Because this WHOLE CONVERSATION WAS WHY THE FUCK CANT BLIZZARD BAN A FEW BOTTERS. All i got was "its a mmorpg, its harder than you think" and "they need to leave them to better understand them" which are two NONSENSE reasons. They are basic fucking bots, theres nothing complex about them, they aren't my cheats that are sometimes at the kernel level. Its basic botting that everyone knows thats been around since EVER. Fucking ban them and let them create a new account and give you more money that way.
---
i thought it was great
---
Classic Horde answer
---
This is a very interesting point of view. Have not thought of that.
---
I’m flattered.
---
Keep in mind thats 86 in a 2 min peroid. I saw 2 large groups go in prior that i did not catch on video and a few huge ones after.
---
It was not. I have been there, I have played it. It was not. Not even close.
---
I knew that wasn’t really her stepson!
---
Well most people aren’t going straight off a coordinated fight, and there only better on that big scale if it all goes as planned.
---
As for pve orcs have blood fury which is good dps, Taurens get war stomp to keep small mobs off healers as well as having +5% health, trolls have berserking which is like a free blood lust, and undead can heal without carrying food. So just by looking at them compared to the alliances racials it is easy to see they are better in both aspects.
---
I am an alliance player, and I’m not saying we don’t have some good racials like escape artisan, and stoneform but they still don’t compete with will of the forsaken or hardiness.
---
Still doesnt Help when the dominating faction has multiple Honor farming raids nearby
---
Place high health, low damage, fast attacking mobs that stun on attack and aggro when someone gets on the roof. They’ll have to alt-f4 or wait 20 minutes for the mob to kill them. Grief the griefers.
---
&gt;"But worry not! Those kills are still recorded, they just weren’t getting collected into the daily statistics correctly, so they’re not displaying in-game for “yesterday” or “this week” kills/honor. The source of the issue appears to be a scheduling system treating a UTC time as a local time, and we believe we’ve found and fixed that problem a few minutes ago.
---
&gt;We’re also working on a fix to repair the daily statistics which we’re hoping to run Monday, in advance of the weekly rank adjustment, so it will correctly count all your kills and honor correctly for this week."
---
it is also a display issue but nowhere does blizzard classify this as exclusively a display issue
---
&gt; Those kills are still recorded
---
= Blizzard has a record of all HKs
---
&gt;  they just weren’t getting collected into the daily statistics correctly, so they’re not displaying in-game for “yesterday” or “this week” kills/honor
---
= Something is wrong, they definitely aren't displaying. They also aren't getting 'collected into daily statistics" --&gt; scope unclear.
---
&gt;We’re also working on a fix to repair the daily statistics which we’re hoping to run Monday, in advance of the weekly rank adjustment, **so it will correctly count all your kills and honor correctly for this week.**
---
= Everything will be good moving forward. 
---
Personally, I think if it was exclusively a display issue Blizzard would've have said something along the lines of "kills and honor have been correctly counted all weeks (weeks 1/2)".
---
Instead, they say they have a record, things will be counted correctly moving forward, and avoid the topic of week 1/2 entirely.
---
What's bad about this? Dps is not allowed to form a group?
---
Everyone before: remove layering it's ruining the game!
---
Everyone now: we need layering the game is broken without it!
---
I got news for you if you think pvers are going to queue for bgs.
---
Maybe he has? Could be speaking in past tense. Regardless, I think it’s easy to understand the frustration when a company that definitely has the capability to provide a great gaming experience refuses to do so for completely opaque reasons.
---
Being someone who plays blizzard games is the most frustrating experience ever. They seem to have a culture of “never patch, just wait”, and it drives away so many casuals or even veterans from their games.
---
Why are you there :D
---
Lmao man up and gather fellow ally players, when did yall become so afraid of teamin up l m a o
---
Woah, PvE happened on a PvE server!? Why don't the alliance just form their own raids to farm insignias!? 
---
/s
---
No. I'm on Grobbulus and the pop is pretty even
---
Mostly because there are more Horde players on (most) PvP realms.
---
There's also a little truth to the thing of Horde being more aggressive in general. Their racials and overall race aesthetics can engender slightly more aggressive behaviour. But this probably only accounts for 5-10% of the explanation.
---
Cry pussy cryyyyy
---
Using an addon such as auctioneer or auctionator gives you both the vendor and the AH price (cheapest price the last time you scanned) in the tooltip of the item, making the choice obvious.
---
Just fake it till you make it. Don't mention you don't know the dungeon and just wing it. Everyone starts somewheres dude. 
---
On a side note id get a list of all pre-raid bis you need to start farming as a tank. And you'll get it figured out.
---
I know a lot of us on a pvp server would easily swap servers in a heartbeat if we could bring our mains over. But starting from scratch when you've already logged in more time played at 60 than it took us to get to 60 is not worth starting over from fresh again. But I agree with you.
---
I wanted to not like this idea, but the more I mulled it over the more it intrigued me. I really, really love the prospect of perfectly balanced world pvp ratios. However, in the event of unbalanced server populations, Herod 1a alliance would face an even more impossibly skewed imbalance. Perhaps the purgatory layer should offer an amnesty buff which would optionally disable world PvP so you could at least quest or grind, in lieu of being able to group with your faction outside of the dungeons you proposed.
---
So if you use taunt + mocking blow, challanging shout and granades then you can hold aggro. But the thing is that concecration + blessing of sanctuary, retri aura and holy shield makes crazy amounts of dmg and threat on groups of mobs. Much much more than a warrior could ever dream of. And it scales. The more mobs the more damage and threat. You really dont need a taunt, when you out-damage the frost mage in your group. And in strat and scholo you have exorsism which mostly makes up for a taunt.
---
May I ask what are some good way to farm money as a tank that is not mining? Because I've looked around and most of the popular farming tactics can not be done (easily or at all) as a tank.
---
ZF is mages.
---
Mara is mages/locks/priests/druids.
---
DM Trib runs for hunters.
---
Pickpocket BRD for rogues.
---
Can not farm elementals because they are contested by people with instant damage abilities (shaman, hunter). In general most open world mob farming spots we are unable to get tags.
---
We can not solo elites for rare drops.
---
Kind of feel lost without mining, tbh. This is why we tanks sell our services, because we literally can not make money like everyone else does and have to leverage the ONE thing we can do better than other classes.
---
you're quite mistaken, the alliance are busy camping somewhere else lol
---
you act like the alliance is some bastion of purity and morality when the reality of the situation is they do the same thing if they can rally together enough people. of course they get completely obliterated if they come to BRM and try to stop us so these past few days they just resort to camping elevators in undercity where they can only kill people flagged for PvP. if you want to talk about low honor gains, look at that. lmao
---
Can't speak for everyone who does this, but I do know of two people personally who have gotten banned for it. Although they were 30 day bans not perma.
---
I played on one of the most populated servers in vanilla and while it wasnt uncommon for a zone to devolve into a world pvp match or the find a few people camping some lowbie areas it also wasnt anywhere near constant. 
---
Ganking raids and fighting for farming spots was why people rolled on pvp servers. Doesnt really seem to be whats happening here.
---
I mean, its definitely noticeable when you are leveling a Warrior, without the axe I avoid anyone higher level then myself and with it I can comfortable take people 1-2 levels higher.
---
I was just pointing it out because like I said before, i’m leveling my 2nd Orc Warrior since release - I didn’t follow the Axe for about 4 levels (around level 35 picking Xcaliboar over WW Axe for the slight DPS increase) on my first Warrior and it was really damn noticeable.
---
Ahh yes
---
Wow before BG. Those were the day’s.
---
I remember that one town near under city just being a battlegrounds. It was all fun and games unless you had to level in that area
---
They are the best flagcarriers by a mile, and as you might know, thats the objective of the game.
---
I say LFG if I’m solo because I’m just that: solo. There’s a decent likelihood that whatever I’m looking for has a group started somewhere already I figure. Again this is all semantics
---
So the community part of this comes in to play where you contact his guild to notify them of his dubious conduct.  The real offense here is that he left the group, leaving 4 of you stranded.  He certainly should have mentioned that he'd roll on HoJ if it dropped - but not everyone studies loot tables like we do.  In vanilla I had no idea what dropped where and every time I ran an instance I was just hoping something cool would drop that I wanted.
---
Played all expansions minus legion and bfa. Wod was complete trash I think I played for a week and gave it up. Mop I actually enjoyed and cata for me was super mediocre. Lk amazing bc amazing. 
---
Classic is the way they brought me back. However my opinion is waning of them as a company. 
---
There was a post earlier this week where a Gm did an automated response and was a copy pasta to a different player where they responded to a completely different player and had the names mixed up. 
---
That’s a telling sign of how poor the customer service is atm. They need to fix that shit ASAP. 
---
Also faction imbalance and server sizes are the next issues they need to address. Add faction changes whether it be free horde to alliance or paid so I and many others can actually play the game. 
---
First and foremost fix their customer service tho. What a dumpster fire that is
---
You are mistaken. Your irrelevant link doesn't change that.
---
Druid is by far the worst PvP healer for BGs
---
Git gud lmao "all for wpvp BUT" lol

---
Herod never broke 8K.
---
When I started playing back in the day, I looked at the alliance and saw humans, a monarchy, and a seemingly rigid system of order. 
---
Why oh why would teenage me want to play an RPG where so many parts of the alliance seemed to mirror my real life when I could be a fuckin zombie or a sentient hippy cow or a drooling orc swinging around a massive axe in a setting where the faction seemed more like a friendship of mutual benefit rather than a "there's humans and then everything else, take a number and go to the back of the line" type of setting. Never cared for what I considered the goody goody faction. I have yet to play alliance and I'll never do so.
---
In essence: Edgy teen liked zombies and spikes.
---
So, spending 7 \* 15$/month and playing 40h/week on a game is an good example for you to understand how economy works?
---
Duh it would break immersion. /S
---
Refined Deeprock salt goes for less than 8gold on Mograine...
---
You don't have a working link to Healcomm do you? Can never get that add-on to work.
---
To be fair, it pretty much is. I don't PVP at all, got my full pre-bis ages ago and now I just login once a week to raid for 2 hours. So, sure if you count that as content.
---
I'm not 100% sure they exist, but they probably do. But, try watching some YouTube tutorials on the dungeons to learn the pathing.
---
You’re the one that chose to play on a pvp realm
---
Had a dream I got my first boe purple world drop last night. 40g til mount, in getting desperate.
---
I leveled so slowly on pve server I didn't see any horde until much later
---
This is the vanilla experience mate lol, vanilla wasn't a game that held ur hand
---
https://youtu.be/BldVX-FbPos
---
Check out this video about the high end WSG meta.
---
Ya he just needs to leave that guild. I’ve never been in a guild like that and have been doing MC/ Ony every weekend for the last two months.
---
Hey I’m sorry man but I just noticed you play OSRS as well. It’s a shame how there’s no class that kinda resembles the way RS plays. I was thinking a shaman might? Or a warrior... ugh, lol.
---
I’d recommend starting with BRD and saving for epic mount!
---
Herod Horde here. I see big groups roaming constantly (both sides). ..it does not look fun. I frequently get ganked 5v1 and wonder how these people have the spare time to grief single players.
---
4 healers is plenty for 20man Ony.
---
I play on a pserver that has stealth guards on the roofs, seems like a no-brainer.
---
We're at war with a Horde guild and so we are "encouraged" to gank anyone with their tag. It's not an RP server btw, we just like to do it occasionally. Normally I don't like people who gank lowbies, but we (and other guilds) have had such a problem with this particular guild that we just made them kill on sight. 
---
So I was in Gadgetzan fooling around with the walls, trying to jump up the different roofs for screenshots and laughs. When I finally got on the top I saw a level 40 ish member of that most evil of guilds. So I fired off a soulfire on his ass and sent him scurrying back to the spirit healer. I took some more screenshots and then logged off. The next day I was greeted to a three day suspension. 
---
I accept my fate and take responsibility for my actions.
---
They were in hard-core guilds lmao
---
Wow has always been like this. When I came to vanilla after playing EQ for years, I was shocked how awful the community was here. After 15 years though, it's kind of expected, and I'm pleasantly surprised when it doesn't happen. Lower your expectations.
---
The instant charging and WWing Warrior is the only one that’ll get threat right away in that case :/
---
I honestly feel like warriors and some mages might be the new hunters, lol
---
Herod 1a would be exclusively for whichever faction is not able to log in to Herod 1. 100% H or 100% A, providing these players the ability to play while in queue for Herod 1.
---
How so? Hard to CC, hard to kill, mobility, healing on the move, stealth
---
I think it's hilarious that millenials and there gameplay behavior and efficiency and min maxing have ruined the game.  This is the difference between the playerbase that was in 2004 and the one now.  I'll take the players from 2004, that was a truly great experience.
---
Thanks for this response!
---
I died. Thank you.
---
We use silent bidding with highest bidder wins. Havent had any complains about it
---
I have not seen content this lazy since the last Jedi.
---
Good points, bad language.
---
Smaller companies run call centres for entire operations, but a subscribed game that you pay monthly for won't have any call centres or direct online support.
---
Blizzard are also known for their bad support in general so I am not surprised you feel like there's a lack of care on their end.
---
Roof camping / roof attacking is against TOS.
---
Yea you wanna go those dungeons to farm your pre raid bis, focusing on getting 9% hit or 6% if youre orc with axes, other stats are not *that* important. You want Thrash Blade in main and Mirahs song in offhand as a tart fury build. You respecc into fury literally 5 minutes after raid. I did 8 after invites started because I thought we would start later :P your rotation is not much different than arms, just swap that MS with Bloodthirst. 
---
Enough of that, just look up the map of the dungeon so you are not that lost and go kill the bosses you want. At the start tell them you are new. Mark. Every. Single. Mob. Tell them which to kill first. Hopefully after time they will tell you to stop with that bs cuz the run is ez, that means you are doing great!!
---
Camping towns isn't against the rules, only spots where guards can't reach you (rooftops).
---
Classic might see some influx of players, but the more closer you get to P6 the less time players would have to farm raid consumables and gold and more raid consumable will be used on tries. 
---
Now you need 1 day 3-5h to clear 1+11 bosses of Ony+MC in raid where at least 20 players have full consumables. Phase 3 would add BWL taking extra 1-2 days. Phase 4 adds ZG that requires separate consumables 1d for this one. And then come AQ20 AQ40 with a lot of nature damage. Some guilds would stop raiding MC at this point trying to keep raid time about 3-4 days/week with the rest dedicated to consumables farming.
---
When P6 arrives only huge guilds with 3+ raids would allow to prepare fresh members by Raiding  MC+BWL. Smaller guilds would begin merging as they would loose some members to grind fatigue. Thus they wouldn't have time to revisit old raids to ger up fresh blood and would be limited to stealing raiders from even smaller guilds who can't merge with anyone even to start AQ40.
---
And then Naxx bosses would test wipe endurance. Thouse who hasn't accumulated gold from earlier phases would soon find themselves out of recources and time to refill numerous raid consumables. Kel'Thuzed is known as guild breaker for a reason.
---
I ask again, do you feel that OP should try to reason his/hers GM or splitting into 2 guilds that may not survive phase 4-5 seems better option?
---
You mean he didn't run away/stand still and spam emotes?
---
I make money with mining and alchemy. I browse the AH every day for herbs and then sell consumables for a 10-50% markup, and I do transmutes every day on two characters.
---
I almost exclusively sell fire prot pots and greater arcane elixir, but sometimes stoneshield and major mana as well. I make about 500g a week between the two while actively PvPing
---
I know, i understand the logic of paladins being useful in these dungeons specifically, i play horde and we dont have pallies (played pally in vanilla) just said id prefer a warrior because i dont trust random players till i see them perform so me personally (and im sure many others) id feel better with a warrior or druid tank since they can taunt.
---
It sucks, but I feel bad for the new players the most. The friends I introduced to classic quit because of the current state of pvp.
---
Cross server queues should mean that they won’t be too terribly long
---
Personally I just use LFG, because as I said elsewhere, the odds are good that whatever I’m looking to run already has some form of a group started somewhere in chat.
---
Meh, I liked it... causes it's what I do daily. :-)
---
They arent lmao look at gehennas for example, even if horde has higher pop allies still rule every zone
---
I respect your ideals. As an Ally on Incedius and someone who's waited for years to play this game, I'm absolutely sick and tired of the Horde murdering me immediately off the flight path and then gaking me 25 times on the way to BRD, UBRS or MC.
---
It doesn't matter if we roll in as a raid. There's too many, all the time. I have to wake up early and make my way to an instance I HOPE people will want to run later. Even then, I'm still getting fucked by 6 people at a time. Most of the time, I recognize my killer has having already killed me multiple times. I'm worth zero honor, but they don't give a fuck. It's all about that troll life. 
---
My friends are either going to transfer or straight up quit if this keeps happening. It's not fun. It's not emergent gameplay. And I'm sick of people saying I should get over it and reroll pve. Sure, I wish I could tell my past self that a bunch of neckbeards would be rolling 20 deep on the Menethil Harbor docks/boat. Or making me waste an hour of my time just to get to my favorite instances. Hell, doesn't even matter if I just took rez sickness at a graveyard so I can hearth back. Dead before I even fully come alive. Everywhere I travel, is death. 
---
Sorry to rant but legitimately have yet to see a Horde player on our server acknowledge how the behavior of many on their faction hurts the overall health of the game.. And their own long-term enjoyment.
---
&gt; like 5
---
Try 2 that have ever had more than 10K. None have near 10k in the last couple of weeks. So the answer to "currently" is "actually 0".
---
As there is no walljumping required to reach this position it is not considered an exploit. Not giving the guards a ranged attack is not abusing a bug.
---
I honestly don’t think the horde would care. In their frantic scramble to grab anyone that Rez ASAP they wouldn’t even be looking at the res honorless debuff. If they get honor ok. I’d not ok. Move on. I don’t think it would matter.
---
Reroll pve, its worth i promise
---
True enough
---
Hormonal teenagers dude, no use arguing with it.
---
Private servers have been operating with larger than 3500 server caps for years. It worked and population didnt decline it only grew. People are complaining now but it wont be nearly the same soon enough.
---
He's delusional.
---
I would pull up the guides and at least know the boss fights. Order I tanked was BRD, LBRS, DM East, Strat live, DM North, Strat UD, Scholo, UBRS. You’re fine tanking in std raid fury build or stay arms if you’re not raiding yet. After a couple runs you’ll be familiar with pulls and just take it slow till you are;make sure you’re not just charge pulling when it doesn’t make sense  and marking will help you out. And if you can get in a group as dps I highly recommend it and watch what the tank is doing.
---
The thing is, sure, there is more horde players, so most likely more jerks/griefers. But I had the same salty experince as you, playing horde. All im trying is to answer your question. Imo it have nothing do with factions or what ever. Im not offended, idk why you would think that. We are both having the samme issue regarding griefers.
---
That happened
---
They aren't following the NA release schedule. Things we're purposely head back on NA so EU could catch up - because of a later release. I thought this was common knowledge.
---
I kind of remember Alliance either being 10 year old kids or people in their thirties or older while Horde kind of had the edgy teenager and young adult crowd.
---
You realise that is because the content is craaaaazy nerfed because classic started with the later patch talents and items?
---
The preraid BiS has like 250+ spellpower more now than it did back then.
---
For example kentic amice or banthok sash had no spell power+hit. Just same ammount of int/sta. The healing staff from Emperor instead of +50 healing had 20 spirit. And Mageblade from MC was the same, but without +40 spell power.
---
I also got it my first Mara run, I was so stoked. Then I realized that there is a ring from DM that’s better. But Blackstone will do for now!
---
You should go fury immediately (if you want to be a dd), you can get 2 pretty good weapons pretty easy. First thrash blade from the maraudon endboss quest, and as offhand miras song from the scholo quest. 
---
For the dungeons: watch guides and get yourself a guild that is willing to teach you stuff. Running dungeons with randoms is a pain in the ass in classic
---
There are pre-raid fury warrior BIS item lists, they usually also describe how to get them. And if you have a guild, they might take you along for some raids.
---
The epic mount part: that is really up to you, if you want to get good gear first you gotta wait for your epic mount. Lion heart helmet for example is the best helmet you can get as a fury warrior for a very long time, and depending on your server it will cost you around 1k gold (its crafted).
---
Mage has alot of utility in PvP, its less agskaggdjal slash, and more calculated.
---
You will need to manage your frost nova, when to ice block, when to evocate, etc. Theres lots of strategies for you vs some classes.
---
I know they said warts and all, but you gotta think they can add something to the game to fix that problem. Like either allow guards to get up there, add a kill plane, something.
---
If they're going to just ban people who do it, you'd figure it would just save time to make a system that makes it so they can't abuse it, right?
---
Ikr lmao allies wanting to bend game rules in their favor cause they cant pvp
---
I think most of yah wont be happy till they "poof" right in front of you with a confirmation that they were banned
---
80-20 rule. 80% of the outputs of a system can be obtained by putting in 20% of the effort. The last 20% takes the other 80% of your effort to achieve. Even just a small effort would have made a massive difference in the outcome and would be well worth the ROI.
---
I don't think people will que then have time to go to an area to camp then once the bg is over they go back to a city to que again.  So it should help a bit
---
Intensity.  Normally.  But they are kinda free to go wherever.
---
Only dogs I kick are Alliance.
---
I know you think your a mad lad, but think for a moment. In what way has your comment contributed to this conversation? Every one knows Blizzard is a big company. Absolutely stupid comment. Waste of everyones time.
---
its not temporary
---
If they were following EU release schedule then we would have DM at release?
---
Same. My transfer option were to two west coast pvp servers and one east coast pvp. Wtf.
---
*Retail quietly sitting in the corner not being nearly as bad as you may have heard or think*
---
Fuck layering go back to retail lmao
---
The no honor buff should be you aren't flagged for 30 seconds unless you attack someone. Even if you give no honor you are still at a disadvantage once you rez. You are at half health and with no buffs so you are easy kill. Then give the buff for 30 seconds after you rez. This would solve 90% of the complaints. You couldn't get killed at the fp and get to dungeons faster even when camped.
---
I love classic, but this is all bullshit.
---
So the problem is that the next few parts of the chain do not require the sword. So I don’t have a quest to abandon, and talking to Donova doesn’t do anything. I think maybe a ticket is the way to go.
---
there's a weird insistence on this sub that it was a display-only issue...
---
I think the majority of players weren't affected and the idea that they got an unfair leg up is unappealing.
---
It’s a Druid healer, he can use it as Feral, he had the ability to roll on it, as did you. This isn’t the definition of a ninja lol
---
I did a two proportion test of the data and found a z-score of -15.7586 to reject the null hypothesis that the populations are equal. I doubt you're in a position to discredit my understanding of statistics.
---
Undead rogues have been camping  Marshall Dughan since 2005. This is what you signed up for by rolling PvP.
---
If yall can't pvp then reroll we dont wanna be fucked cause of yall
---
Ask someone else to lead and pull. I've taken the lead in Scholo as a Mage and it was completely fine.
---
To do the quest you have to travel to Un'Goro and then back to turn in the quest. Probably easier to just kill Phalanx or pickpocket the key. It might be worth it if she opens the door for free every time, though.
---
But the horde aren't really more popular. With all realms combined it's almost a perfect 50 50 split
---
Little reason, yeah. After acquiring Mirah, which takes 1-2 runs, they have little reason to go there. 
---
One incentive above all is money though - I offer all unwanted greens to disenchant to the tanks to get them to join
---
I think this is our answer.
---
Seeing comments about how horde races are cooler and I can see the appeal. Its different and does give more of a fantasy aspect to the world. I'm alliance but something I've always thought was I think the horde mounts are way cooler than alliance.. Giant wolves, raptors, beastly kodos and a mount that looks identical to the one from strat ud that everyone dies if it drops. Compared to horses, rams, giant tigers and weird and loud robot chickens
---
Edit: not saying this is why they chose to play horde but I wish I could get a wolf at lvl 40
---
They said they have a record of the kills but they were not showing. We kind of already knew that because lifetime kill displays were correct and at odds with weekly totals.
---
They weirdly do not speak to them calculating ranks correctly or not
---
hurr durr durr i hate potentially unfair pvp but i chose to roll on a pvp server instead of just doing PvE and BGs. uh oh the big meanie hordies are camping somewhere, better quit/unsub instead of trying to retaliate and forming our own raid group. oooh nooo i can't do it because my guild are all raidloggers and all the fem night elves and humans are busy ERPing and don't want to participate in pvp or help the cause!! the game should be changed for everyone because of my poor decisions and my inability to handle losing something i could have easily avoided by not participating in.
---
the system isn't garbage, your faction is.
---
You honestly don’t make enough gold to “invest” in anything. You need like 3-4k to start playing that game seriously. You’re going to get like 5 flasks and be broke. Just get your epic mount. Time=gold and moving faster saves you time
---
The only pressure is seeing other people in great gear and wanting the same. Imagine that?
---
Lets be real, its not scummy enough to be perm :P honestly imo it should be 48 hour warning, 7 days, 30, perm. If you keep doing it after you're warned, you're an asshole who should be banned.
---
Horde Paladin?
---
I never have problems finding a tank.
---
&gt;!I am the tank!!&lt;
---
Wait what did ppl expect from wpvp? This is exactky what i expected lmao
---
Let them. All the alliance will be safe in SW/IF queuing for instant BG's lol
---
Last one I can think of right now. What is DKP and how/why is it used to distribute loot in raids?
---
What do you have to back up your claim of 90%?
---
I quit when I killed LK HC and I will try Shadowlands for sure.
---
Ohhh it’s a Druid, his colors are hard to see. Point still stands.
---
Right but are those things close to quest objectives? Or are they contained in their own areas?
---
Against good players their hots get purged quickly. They also have no good low cast time heal to spam to keep people up. No offensive or defensive magic dispel.
---
They are decent support class but as a dedicated PVP healer they are lacking
---
So names that have the N word in them should be allowed?  Or allude to rape or molestation? 
---
Get fucked.
---
I always taken it for looking for more.
---
Horde also has much easier access to most dungeons while leveling as well.
---
I always expect these kind of comments are made by very casual players who will take 3-4 months to 60, then start an alt because they are not interested in endgame. During leveling in Classic you are pretty much a nobody.
---
No
---
This would work except dps are a dime a dozen, and I see the same people lfg for tanks for well over 45 mins to an hour. 
---
If I'm giving up guaranteed 40g an hour doing jump runs with my buddy to help carry your trainwreck of a pug and get YOU geared out I expect some compensation.
---
Tanking for guildies is fun. I'll do that for free. Tanking for randoms is a tossup and can be a horrible, horrible experience. There is a reason tanks are hard to come by.
---
they say they have a record not that calculations were done correctly.
---
We knew they were recorded somewhere because lifetime totals were correct despite weekly number issues
---
My server is the other way around (gehennas) ally dominate 80% of the day in all zones lmao
---
&gt; But don't leave just because you want a Leaf. You could very well end up in a worse situation and still be last in line to get it.
---
You don't leave because you didn't get the leaf, you leave because being a loyal member of this guild isn't rewarding you, and plenty of other guilds will. Many people will lose "their spot in line" if they know they actually **get a spot** by moving to a better guild, rather than being at the mercy of a lazy gm.
---
I'm tired of these Alliance constantly crying. "Theres like 5 EU servers currently over 10K". That's a lie. "My server is 5:1" also a lie it's like 1.5:1. "45/55 is so imbalanced waaah Blizzard". 
---
Stop having mount parades in IF and go do some PVP on your PVP server.
---
Make your own groups.  People won't bail on a group with a tank.  When you get there explain that you don't know the dungeon.  Not guaranteeing it will work, but it's worth a shot.
---
ironforge.pro isn't accurate. God, I'm sick of people quoting that site.
---
They aren't glitching to get on that roof so it's not banable lol. You can just jump onto it from the FM hill.
---
did it work
---
When you don't know the bug exists, of course you fucking do. God damn this sub is so fucking technologically inept.
---
That is exactly the reason I like Melee over ranged.
---
Try out rogue or warrior very fun to play!
---
The results are pretty much the same at all ranges. Try looking at 50-60, the biggest problem right now is that level 50-59 people can't level, so those level ranges are very much relevant.
---
Not really - you can download it and a map with all spawn areas - but they won't help you find ore/herbalism as they can get farmed by other players. You will see the location, but get no information whether or not they are herbs/ores currently there
---
This. Back in vanilla I onetime purposefully hunted DKs and went from rank 10 to 8 in a day
---
Go to retail then
---
My two guesses on next topics people will be mad about:
---
1. Please do something about the matchmaking so we don't have to face premades or I'm unsubbing.
---
2. This is not the AV I remember, it should last 2 hours not 10 minutes, people are just rushing now.
---
This id wpvp mate, what did u expect?
---
Jump on the corner from the hill where the alliance flightmaster is standing.
---
Ok Blizzard. Yes I will play retail. Just let me play it at the SAME TIME as classic. It’s such a stupid limitation they put on that. You need a second account if you want to play on both.
---
Zandalar Tribe is very nice. I play alliance and have no problem finding skirmishes etc.
---
Tons of groups to all levels of pve still.
---
Economy also appears to be healthy - plenty of ways to make money.
---
In many ways, it's world PvP as you remember it. Lots of questhubs / fp / boats / zeps being camped. A ton of overall shit fights mixed in with a few good ones.
---
We have a server discord (horde / alliance / neutral) and a subreddit.
---
Good luck :)
---
and how much honor are they getting for killing 30s?
---
Goes to show its less about honor farming and more about being toxic assholes.
---
&gt;Didn't stop them that time, why would they suddenly decide to be honorable now?
---
Now in the past.
---
Those are safe bets
---
I've always found this to be goofy logic. To remotely pretend that a MAJORITY (or even notifiable amount) of people playing classicwow consistently will pivot to retail for minor content updates is ridiculous.
---
I mean honestly. You think there's some kind of notable player base that has dropped retail, and is ready to drop classic on a Dime? That's just bizarre.
---
The only meaningful drop will be if Blizzard makes Shadowlands loot  / power curve grind systems less cancerous, which based on conversations sounds like they're entertaining. If they do everything they've said so far, AND rework titanforging (last blue post says they're entertaining looking at it, which is actually big by Blizzard standards) then we'll see a drop... But... Thats about when  AQ40, maybe even Naxx will be out...which leads to... You're aware Blizzard is strategically designing this around retail launches right?
---
I think you missed the retail tourist bogeyman hoax clarification memo
---
no, you are being incredibly lame and ive grown tired of you. goodbye.
---
As long as you're not one of these cloth-wearing chumps and your gear is roughly similar, you can wittle them down most of the way without even casting (shield, shocks, searing/nova totem, flametongue hits). If you're EM, a single pummel juke will win you the duel outright. If you're NS, you don't even need to care about pummel.
---
Sounds like either gear or you're underestimating your ability to deal damage outside of lightning bolts/chains. Remember that with full Mail gear + a shield you will have almost the same armor as a full Plate set without a shield.
---
Good answer, those are some fair points
---
This.  Alliance was son overpopulated in vanilla the blood elves made it to horde to fix imbalance.
---
I haven't experienced either of those.
---
Good point, thank you
---
Here are path maps, you can supplement with videos if these are not enough for you to learn the route.
---
https://www.fadedandblurred.com/wow-classic-dungeon-maps-for-tanks/
---
Deep prot is better than fury for Dungeon tanking when you dont have much gear. Fury tank spec doesnt get tactical mastery, whick makes tanking 5 man dungeons harder. To learn more about tank specs, look up youtube vids by Skarm Tank.
---
You could use Google and find a guide in .5 seconds, or you could do as 99% of the population and just pretend to be semi-afk and follow whoever moves first in the dungeon. If you happen to run the wrong way, blame auto run.
---
I'm an alliance on a PVP server, and I'm generally suprised. Suprised that people didn't know that this was going to happen. I mean really, the first time this happened, 15 years ago, you could be forgiven, forgiven for not knowing that the honor system was going to come and wreak chaos. 
---
But I loved it then and I love it now. Yes, camping and griefing included. When I looked at the phases I was literally licking my lips looking at the pvp honor phase before the introduction of battlegrounds. 
---
I was suprised that so many rolled on a pvp server, but I assumed they did it for the same reason I did, to taste some of that hardcore endless world pvp of classic. 
---
So why all the crying now? This is what we signed up for. This is history repeating itself, you knew this was going to happen. You knew that the PVP honor system would return, heck they even softened the blow by immediatly introducing dishonorable kills which in vanillah where added later. 
---
You knew the servers would be imbalanced. 
---
What did you expect? 
---
But this time, when I
---
Up until last night our guild had to field pugs and couldn't use any dkp. I've seen rogues not even in top 15 on damage win rolls on gear over the guild rogues including myself, who's is typically the guilds top dpser lose out to these guys. It is a bit irritating but it is what it is when you roll pugs in your group.
---
You're hilarious. Roll PVE then you fucking cry baby.
---
No they fucking wouldn't call Comcast right now ttell them your cables out and you need someone to come out. If they send someone before wensday I will send you 500$
---
Im a Gnome Warlock in a PvP guild. I say Let Them Come!! They act like a Herd rather than Horde. Im Sergeant Major rank, it has been a grind for Honour!!
---
🔊I’m just a mage and life is a nightmare 🔊
---
Wait until you see what a road is, it will blow your mind!
---
Yeah, overall just feels smoother playing Horde.
---
Are you a new player? Didn't play WoW back in the day? Just wondering.
---
&gt;You're comparing things that became features later in the game, actual quality of life changes.
---
What's your point? In classic you still don't have those "features" unless you use the add-ons and they still give you an advantage over players who don't use them, whether they later became features in future expansion is 100% irrelevant.
---
&gt;Spy uses data to display information that is near hidden to the normal player, no one is actually reading a combat log to type names into chat my guy, especially in a busy area. 
---
Yes I'm aware of what it does it takes information that you have access to and makes it easier to see. Just like every threat meter add-on in existence or any number of different add-ons I could choose at random.
---
You guys are seriously idiots
---
Your reading comprehension needs some work.
---
&gt; In what way has your comment contributed to this conversation?
---
I'm laughing at people huffing the farts from a 42 billion dollar company and making it their life mission to defend a company who gives $50 million firing bonuses to shitty execs but refuses to put any money in actually improving the service we get as paying customers. 
---
So to anyone who doesn't enjoy the taste of blizzards tight pucker, it contributed by validating what they've been thinking, or maybe gave them a small laugh. Judging by the upvotes on it, I'm saying more people agree than don't.
---
Lame
---
"Wow you stupid idiot, you should have read all the forum threads and watched all the YouTube analysis about exactly what was going to happen in phase 2 without any doubt whatsoever so that you would have known to roll Horde and not Alliance so you wouldn't run into these problems. Honestly, it's just on you for not doing your research instead of wanting to have 'fun' or whatever. Fucking casual, l2p."
---
&gt;there are PVP than PVE servers
---
Sound like you accidentally a bottle of cola.
---
&gt;If Horde outnumbers Alliance in PVP servers, Alliance outnumbers Horde in PVE servers
---
The fact you don't even take amount of players/concurrent online into notification is sad, despite it fits your narrative.
---
&gt;It's closer to 60:40.
---
Could be.
---
&gt;Or what is your latest census data?
---
Wowclassicpop, IIRC that's the most widely used census.
---
Only Horde and neutral areas get knockback and ranged guards. Alliance get the lvl 20 sailor men.
---
Where else is he supposed to res?  they literally sit at max corpse Rez range and wait.  
---
You go from burning steppes you die to rogues as soon as you touch the stone path.
---
Yeah it's not as if you don't have an invisible pet that can charm the rogue for 8 seconds right as the cheap shot wears off.
---
Honestly a 4.5k hp soul linked warlock should be a rogues worst nightmare.
---
I hope the whole content of classic is rushed in 1 year.
---
Nope.
---
Got free time bb. Got a friend who works at blizz and they can give out 1 year subs like hot cakes.
---
How bored do you have to be to still be doing this.
---
I don’t disagree that a proper solution from Blizzard needs to be discussed, but when u say fair to both sides I kinda have to Lul. Right now alliance is getting shredded and shit on( not fair to alliance) yet to solve this we must make sure the horde are pampered to? Wtf. They got free honor for a week? More? I think the trade off is fair. We’ve paid for our balance in blood already. Have the horde?
---
The fact that I get camped by a raid team if I attempt to do any dungeons is why I barely go on my main now. Pretty much just waiting for BGs to come out
---
Nah. Good guilds only gear the tank enough to survive the most dangerous boss in the tier (which is usually NOT fully geared), and after that prioritize DPS. Even the old conventional wisdom of trying to give 8 warriors 4 pc T3 for 4 horsemen isn't actually necessary. Taunt resists don't actually happen that often and you need two taunt resists in a row (low probability event) for a transition to fail. Giving rogues those T3 tokens is more likely to lower the time to kill of the boss and reduce the number of transitions necessary, which is more likely to increase probability of success, than giving your 3rd-8th tanks 4 pc T3. (Plus the 4H don't hit for shit. You can tank them in blues).
---
Higher DPS, which reduces time to kill, overall reduces the number of repeats of boss abilities you have to handle, and can cause you to skip full phases of some bosses. The "gear up the tanks" (and healers, back in 2004-early 2005) mentality is a contributing factor of why it original took guilds so long to kill Ragnaros back in the day. Their DPS was so bad they had to deal with two Sons of Ragnaros phases. I specifically remember when my guild was working on Rag, some other guild released a video or screenshot or something of their Rag kill, and we noticed how few healers they had relative to us and how many rogues they had. So we worked really hard to maximize our DPS instead of survivability. People removed shitty fire resist items for good DPS items, I got to actually DPS as shadow in the raid instead of healing on my priest, etc.
---
DPS wins raids.
---
Mage could be like that, depending on who you're fighting. Or if you're aoe-ing a bunch of people with healers keeping you alive. 
---
For instance if you frost nova a hunter then attack them from their dead zone, they can't do anything.
---
Overall though, classic wow in particular isn't exactly an action-game kind of experience with pvp. It's more about positioning and who you're grouped with.
---
Also if ur actually good and bring ur own consumables to a guild trial and do well on the meters smart players will want to council loot to u so u stick around
---
dont you think twitch and the retail players are gonna impact the meta? a lot of classic is already drastically different than lights hope or nost, kronos
---
Ah okay thanks for that, had no idea people could do this to calculate online players because of the api limitations
---
not really. don't think you know the difference between ganking and camping. You don't tell your group, "yo let's go Gank Thorium Point FP." lol... You do gank people from Thorium Point to BRM.
---
The point is Blizzard have explicitly stated that classic is under-supported. They have a small handful of people supporting a game bringing in $15M+ a month
---
Sap me, kill the succubus that’s standing right next to me.
---
If your an undead rogue, you simply racial the charm
---
Also your not gonna want to die and lose consumables and world buffs
---
He can't. That's the point of this post.
---
This is the most brain dead "solution" people keep spitting out. Most people wanted the pvp server experience. No one figured the extreme server capacity would make it into what it is now. You can't blame people for rolling onto pvp servers. No one expected this shit that's happening. It's not the same
---
Did you really see this coming or do you just see other mongoloids saying that so now you parrot it because you can't comprehend that we went from PvP (phase 1) to "minority faction become mobs" (phase 2)? 
---
Seeing as you have no refutation to anything I said besides boilerplate Horde fragility, I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess that you didn't see shit.
---
Anathema pvp isn't bad, last I checked it was like 48% horde
---
I don’t play Classic so I’m a little out of the loop but I keep seeing people talk about this. Can someone explain what the deal with the roof is? Are they glitching something or just camping?
---
**"Omg why the fuck are there no tanks in this server?!?!?!?"**
---
"lol you're charging people to actually help them out and get their run done? What a loser."
---
Tanks that charge you for the gold you make in 10 minutes are better than calling off your dungeon run because no one showed up to tank it.
---
The only time I’ll grab my main and/or my buddies when I it looks like the campers are at the same gear level as my main and those of my buddies. If they outgear us significantly it’s a pointless waste of time and I’m better served by signing off and playing a different alt until the camper gets bored and decides to do something else.
---
I'm looking into my crystal ball, I'm...seeing a post 6 months in the future from /u/Mis4nthrope :
---
&gt; "What the fuck is blizzard doing, why is my server dead?! My queue times are taking forever, this is ridiculous! They killed classic!"
---
Don't worry, [we all did leave the pvp servers.](https://i.redd.it/t6noa03m6v141.png) And when every pvp server is 95%+ horde and nobody wants to play there anymore, I'm sure you'll find another way to not take responsibility.
---
It wasn't only a display issue lol.
---
On the backend, they have the numbers, but in game nothing was actually getting calculated.
---
Honor was actually affected, it wasn't just a display issue.
---
Varies by server I'm sure, but how much should [Prospector Axe] go for on the AH? Once BGs come it should be a good choice for warrior twinks, should I wait until then to see where the market is at? I'm a simply low level, so the potential money from the Axe could be huge.
---
That's false. If an ability says just "crit", it means physical crit.
---
Ok boomer.
---
Let them be frustrated ffs
---
Just look up a youtube video on DM:E jump runs. You'll need a buddy though, because warriors can not solo it like some other classes.
---
I was 14 then and used to believe that female night elves were really girls. Boy was I wrong...
---
That's why they should open faction only transfers. Allow transfers in for the lower pop faction and transfers out for the higher, or just one or the other.
---
Hey thank you for the replies and advice man. I appreciate it a lot! Perhaps I should stick it through with the mage
---
You're comparing late patch MC with early patch Kara. They would release a late patch Kara like they did for MC.
---
For a frost mage, is Spirit of Aquementas better or Fire Runed Grimoire? Online BiS lists have Spirit of Aquementas rated higher, with only Drakestone of Frozen Wrath higher than SoA. That just does not make sense to me since you only lose 8ish bonus damage, but gain stats.
---
what do you mean he cant? he can but hed rather bitch. can lvl in any zone, if you aibt got quests gribd somewhere a little. its shit but its the game. do what you can when you can. work with what you got.
---
Well, someone else made the same meme as you did a couple of weeks ago. Hence low effort.
---
Alliance acts like horde players arent consistently camped in their early leveling zones. I couldnt count the number of times I've logged into lower level toons into Crossroads and an alliance raid party is there just shitting on everything. Everlook is a fuckfest right now thats always dominated by alliance PvP raid parties (Bigglesworth). Dont roll pvp if you dont want pvp. Get good or die trying
---
So you have zero monetary investment yet you invest precious time into the product of a company that you clearly hate. Sounds like it’s you that likes licking blizzard dick.
---
Are you dumb? There's half as many PvE realms. Half.
---
Uh, we will. We love PvP. Just when we decide to do it. No being force farmed and having an unplayable open world.
---
Boring raids that can be completed in blues and greens in under a few hours really does sound like the pinnacle of endgame.
---
Lmao what a child. Your shit post matches your username

There is no specific numbers from blizzard in the history of wow but blue posts say the following...

A blue post said Faerlina had 20k in que waiting to log in around launch time. If you google it per reports vanilla servers were &lt;4k on the high end. This is online cap not in que.
---
Just a blue set. I got lucky with my DR swords but have been dry on weapons for nearly 3 months now. Never seen viskags, lost brutality blade 4 times. I dont want daggers but I finally started rolling on them a few weeks ago because this game does not want me to get better swords.
---
Yeah, keep downvoting! Just come see what happens in Shazzrah EU, a Horde server.
---
There are 3-4 alliance groups that own us, but I dont see anyone bitching about it.
---
As a rogue. I agree.
---
I'm not getting at you specifically, but I despise this line of thought. It's like I'm back in 2014 on r/wow or something. This is exactly why retail collapsed from a 12 million sub game to likely sub 2 million subs in just a few years. Whenever someone is clearly passionate about the game and wants to fix it, they're mocked and told to just unsub if they don't like it.
---
Well...we do? And then the game dies and 2 years later everyone's wondering why the game is so dead. Because the response to passionate fans shouldn't be 'Lol then leave', it should be, 'how do we fix this?'
---
Reroll undead for WOTF
---
I pretty much refuse to do anything unless it's raid night. Same with most of my guild. It was hard enough before world pvp, now it's unplayable. This is what i get for going alliance for the first time in 15 years. I wanted to see their side of the game, but now i regret it, haha.
---
Can we all agree to stop posting idiot responses like this.  Let the manor woman vent that's basically what reddit is for anyway isn't it?  Why do people feel the need to make a comment like this?  Really i am seriously asking.
---
The proc works for druids.
---
I disagree. Tanks that are selling runs are usually a step up above random tanks that you're gonna find in lfg. They're much more geared, using proper spec, and have much more knowledge of the instance. Getting a good tank for 20g is probably going to save you a lot more than just 15 minutes.
---
Makes you wonder how many more bugs/incorrect shit have slipped through the cracks because they downported from Legion.
---
You're ignoring the fact that in actual vanilla, alliance vastly outnumbered the horde. It wasnt until tbc that the horde started getting more people(I'm guessing because of blood elves). Then there was just the fact that the horde had better racials for end game stuff which made the divide even bigger.  Then people started having faction pride. So when they switched to classic they wanted to be horde.  
---
As someone who has played horde since vanilla, I decided to try an alliance toon in classic because I never did alliance in vanilla, and let me just say real quick, the alliance have it exponentially harder in classic than the horde do. And I dont mean just the pvp. In almost every way the alliance classic experience is harder than the hordes.
---
Idk the startup I work for with like 10 engineers doesn’t have a time zone problem 🤷‍♂️ 
---
This leads me to believe that Classic was a project cooked up in 3 months by some summer interns.
---
Holy shit dude
---
Then the user should have to look over at the combat log itself. 
---
This thread has already established that just cause there is an addon that does stuff for you, doesnt mean it isnt cullshit/cheating.
---
I think people finally got a taste of why vanilla isn't as good as they remembered.
---
I don't play because I know how it is. There is a reason to doing this, don't call the person a super toxic troll for farming honor
---
queue, not que
---
I am comparing two games I played. One of them is piss easy and the one was less so when I played.
---
&gt; So you have zero monetary investment
---
I paid a sub and bought every expac from 2007 until 2018 but ok buddy.
---
Name a more iconic trio: a wow forum, bashing anyone who shows the slightest modicum of passion for the game, and then being surprised when the game plummets in popularity.
---
I dont have any of those things as SM/Ruin
---
Come back to Skeram?
---
Grave moss will be relevant in Naxx only iirc (25s my server), BoE are random and you might as well say "I farmed 1 hour to get edgemasters so my farm is 600g/hour" + I don't see 29 bracket being popular enough.
---
Plus grave moss is herbalism farm, not prot warrior farm.
---
Baron is still BiS so you would have obviously rolled on stone gargoyle first not knowing it would drop. Also gargoyle cape is best pvp cape.
---
You get that telling some to get off a roof is a level 1 ticket equivalent, so you are working with people who make 35-45k a year depending on the place. You are relying people who deal with countless tickets a day, with no motivation besides getting yelled at. You are not dealing with the people who get a large chunk of that 42+ billion, you are dealing with regular tech support just like any big company. Those places definitely don’t have 1 hour response times.
---
You are so angry over this computer game.... Why are you so invested in it and others?
---
AHAHHAHA 1 hour 51min your guild calls a speedrun
---
Blizzard back in vanilla when they designed the honor system for the first time.
---
Yeah it's not a get good situation. The servers have too many people on them compared to vanilla. Point still stands though. Game isn't fucked because a guy has to wake up at 5 to farm. Noone should expect to farm freely during normal waking hours. If it's possible to do so then the games pretty dead
---
You're literally fighting empirical data, and you're calling me dumb?
---
Its not always that easy purging the spells, you could asume you have good teammates that dish out damage so the oponent priest have to heal aswell, wich they have to do stationary wich can be easily interupted aswell, things are more complicated than you can just dispell those
---
Ok thank you.
---
I think they should try to fix some stuff before, putting stronger and more guard in cities. Blocking new player to get into a faction in a server. Anything but no transfer, it can only lead to ultimate unbalancing
---
Wtf dude. I’m alt lvling my 53. Took me 37 hrs to get from 50-52. Where are you getting camped. I’d like to know where my alliance is camping people. I almost never see this shit. Feralas, felwood, Tanaris, ungororo, burning Steele’s, thorium pt, Morgan’s vigil, Brm outside, brm inside, brm entrance. Ubrs ledge. I’ve been camped an mirdered endlessly at these points. Where are you getting camped?
---
My Guild in Vanilla actually gave me full FR Gear as a Rogue. I put on FR at Raggi and Vael, which was kinda stupid. And yet I still got aggro but with two Fire-Resi Absorb Trinket I tanked Vael from 9% to 3%...
---
I feel like it's the perfect server. It is very lively and has a near-perfect balance. People in the comments say it isn't as lively as Firemaw or Gehennas - well of course it isn't, as they are the top 2 liveliest. But I get interactions ALL THE TIME whilst I play, yet it doesn't feel too much.
---
The balance is also fantastic. Someone said that Firemaw is a better server and that it "only" has a 60/40 imbalance, but that means one side is 50% stronger than the other.
---
As a person who values interactive and balanced servers, I feel like I got really lucky since I only picked Ashbringer because of its cool name!
---
Ya its def under populated, me and a group of 4 others transfered from sulfuras because of the faction imbalance and ganking and we cant find a tank for anything, the auction house has barely anything on it and everyones basiclly quit because of it, im hoping blizzard will implement server merges or transfers or else my character is dead, unless the server miraculously fills up more.
---
Can't change it without changing gaming culture itself. Why act in a mutually beneficial way? These people can be permabanned and then just cancel their sub and mosey onto the next flavor of the month. Back in 2006 when we had a shitty Windows XP tower and like two games you actually cared if you got a reputation. These days it literally doesn't matter.
---
Read the terms of service instead of blindly hitting accept.
---
I literally say: if that truly happens, I’m happy for them... which means that I don’t necessarily claim its fake and obviously recognized the possibility’s. What is wrong with you? No, this is not my reasoning, no I don’t have issues accepting that this shit happens sometimes. You can’t just come and implants your misunderstanding into anyone minds.You said it even yourself: I didn’t say “it’s fake”... I said “it feels fake”.
---
Camp roofs? You're assuming I'm Horde. I play on Skeram Alliance. Its 75% Horde there. Want a screenshot with your name in chat? Jesus....also how does killing lowbies in a video game affect my real life? People play GTA and kill hookers all day and they seem decent.
---
Nah if the pet is on its way, it’s like an in combat mob. It won’t interrupt it.

30% threat reduction is so much better than windfury. Also Heal Paladins being the best healers by far...

This was literally the best wow video I’ve ever seen. The editing, the voice acting, the comedic timing- all just perfect. Well done, Barny. /salute

It is.. I played back then and did this shit all the time.

Get rid of the Horde. Problem solved.

Yes i know it’s not the black and white response you would expect but still seems like a solid answer that it will be something that happens.
---
These are rough times to be an Alliance baker. Gotta make that bread somehow.

I never (read usually) had more than 5 minutes queues and I play Horde since TBC (Alliance Paladin in Vanilla).

The only time I didn't play WoW was after we Uldir M

Anyone who parrots this bullshit is either lying or trying to justify their scumbag behavior as a disgusting Horde player. It was never once close to be like this, at this scale.

Uhhhhmmm happy birthday? I guess. Hope everything is going well and you’ve got your life all set.
---
In a perfect world.. yes. But sadly were not in a fairtale and people don't read through the ToS before they play.
---
Your sentiment isnt logical just because everybody has their own free will.
---
I know charging for tank services is controversial. The solution is they don't and nobody goes anywhere
---
Good for you. But maybe the guy you are replying to doesn't take joy from respeccing twice every week.
---
How would one go about fixing the faction imbalance?
---
Still nothing :(
---
But if he said he didn't need it at beginning of the run he's a dick for sure for taking it.
---
I got it from my third or so. As it was my second character and I had already experienced the horrors of grinding it the first time around, I was super shocked.
---
That was when layering was active. 1 layer (at launch they had 5 per server) was approximately equal to high/full pop vanilla server, so 1 full classic server was equal to 5 vanilla: of course it was a lot.
---
When they increased the number of players per realm, they have (apparently) increased the number of layers.
---
THEN they have reduced the number of layers as people spreaded over the world more evenly, then people started to quit so the amount of layers was reduced even more: and now we have 1 layer per server.
---
The layer size is now increased compared to launch, but still the census addons show data of 6k concurrent online max at peak for servers which still have queues and most of servers have online around 3.5-4k only.

&gt; Tightly packed caster packs which are made trivial by los pulls but god forbid the dps hold off for two fucking seconds.
---
Holy SHIT why is this so hard for people to understand? There's a bunch of casters in a room with a bunch of other casters and pats. If I hit one button and wait for 3 FUCKING SECONDS they will come to us and we will mow them down. Why must you stand in the doorway and spam them immediately when I faerie fire pull? I haven't even hit one fucking mob yet. The only pug I've ever straight up left was after I warned the group after this happened like 3 times and the lock and mage were still unloading on the pull every time. I had another group in 5 minutes.

/rant
---
Anyway OP this is your answer right here.
---
What servers is this affecting? Gehennas is fine at least according to my nolifing the past 2 weeks.
---
brother, comrade, fellow soviet
---
This. Dungeons are actually a worse option than backwater grinding. People saying to just farm BRD are just  majority faction players camping BRM looking to keep their stream of honor intact.
---
pvp in pvp server lol xd
---
This is great. Thank you for posting!
---
This is what was fun about this game.
---
? Try type something right now there's at least 5 mins delay. It's affecting all the high pop servers the most.
---
I miss AP Sion. Was a great meme build
---
I see Rising Tide everyday, sup from alliance faerlina

Last week there was a guy in Org on my server that for at least 8 hours a day was spamming looking for someone to reroll a healer and level with him from 1-60.  It was the saddest, loneliest thing I’ve seen in a while.
---
You haven't contributed a single meaningful point of discussion in this entire thread. Please shut the fuck up.
---
Okay, you’re probably gonna have to delete your confit folder inside of your wow folder. 
---
So something like world of Warcraft/_classic_/WTF and there you should find the config file. If you delete that all your settings will be removed and it should allow the game to run
---
If you sit on a roof may God strike you down.

Cry moar
---
Thanks. A common problem is that people charge in at first so you don't have time to build aggro. You can tell ppl to stop doing that but when "who makes most dmg" -contest is the thing... I go in and cast a consecration. Then i dmg with ret Aura and sanc blessing + holy shild. I hold aggro fine now and can take some hard hits. But I could use a bit more mana
---
Really? I spent all my money on devilsaur and my pre raid bis weps which are axes cause I play an orc. I switched to fury when I went 55 and now that I’m at 60 I do crazy damage!!! If you like pvp you could stay arms for when battlegrounds come out. Go fury if you’re ready to start raiding. 
---
Rn start going for pre raid bis. And if you aren’t doing damage, you’ve got your rotation messed up. When I was arms I did crazy aoe damage. 
---
As far as not getting invited just tell them you can tank and then right when you start tell them you’ve never done it and they’ll be pretty unlikely to kick you since everyone is gathered up.
---
I wholeheartedly believe it'll get better. 
---
But, I am horde on a horde dominated server so take this with a grain of salt. 
---
When honour first came out, even as horde I could not solo farm anything on my 60 for more than a minute. My alt in his 20s would also get blasted by deathballs in horde zones and contested zones. Outside of raiding and logging on to make moon cloth I took a beak from the chaos too. 
---
Now, solo farming is more feasible on my 60 (there are still a few deathballs rolling around) and the only players I seem to see on my low level alt are opposite faction players also trying to level with the occasional 60 bodyguard. 
---
I realize I'm on the dominant faction so it didn't take long for my gaming experience to return to normalcy. But I expect the same thing to happen for alliance players, just with a longer time frame and definitely not until after BGs come out.
---
Wait dont mages win that match up like 90% of the time?
---
&gt; Sadly, your crystal ball must be an anal bead that's been ripped off its string.

Hot
---
&gt; I don't go on reddit and cry about video games, especially like a petulant child while projecting my 24th chromosome on other people in hopes of sounding woke. 
---
Then what are you doing, right now?
---
&gt; I love reading posts from screeching autists. Don't go blowing your whole load on this thread - You'll get to tell all your fellow sandwich artists about it tomorrow while you're toasting subs.

---
No single drop of water thinks it is responsible for the flood. I'm sure they do know it's bad for the game but they don't think that their individual actions carry that much weight.
---
I still can't see it as 50, more like 30 but okay.
---
How much grave moss is at your server? I expect it's just because of goblins stocking it for naxx.
---
No one reads the terms of service for any software they use, including yourself. Don’t fucking pretend you do.
---
I thought that world pvp was gonna be fun.
---
Get good pub
---
That would be stupid.. how does your guild expect to get a raid formed for a world-boss just via Guild chat?  Do they just hope enough people are online and ready? 
---
It just seems like there is no rational reason for a guild to not use Disc. 
---
And if you miss a raid, why the fuck was it not written down in Ginfo or somewhere people can check? Relying on memory is dumb af in the long run, no offense but if thats how your guild runs i’d look for the exit.
---
Hunters actually aren’t super common if the census websites are anything to by. Warlocks are the only lesser common DPS class.  
---
I’d guess it’s people leveling alts for a gold making toon or something as Hunters are one of the best classes for that.
---
Will it tho? What stops horde players waiting in que to farm extra honor at the same spots they are right now?
---
Rogues, does blade flurry stack with slice and dice?
---
I’m inclined to agree. 100s of tickets is not a very impressive number, but either way, they should hire more support until they can handle their workload. Basic stuff, really.
---
This isn't 2005. The player base is massive compared to then and everyone knows how to min max every aspect of the game. The clusterfuck of 40 man raid running around killing everything in sight is ruining the game for many people.
---
The release of battlegrounds is needed. I doubt they will push the rest of the phases so quickly. They are going to milk our subscriptions as long as they can.
---
Undead is cool and wotf // eat, they mainly target cloth which 2/3 rely on fear which is immediately countered by a racial.
---
Orc, smash.  Can't be stunned, smash harder.
---
Deep, but also true.
---
The post I was responding to was a quote from the HBO miniseries Chernobyl. I didn't think he was actually delusional :D
---
On PvE servers for sure.
---
“Let’s skidado” this is not how I imagined horde players to sound behind the screen lol, it’s too friendly.
---
At least hes trying to make friends.
---
I didn’t say I did, but it’s in there, therefore they don’t need to give a warning. Police don’t warn people for breaking the law. They write tickets and arrest people. Just because you do not know something doesn’t mean it’s okay to do it once.
---

---
What realm are you on friend? 
---
Looks like you just need a good guild and group of friends. : )
---
I forgot pallies have 30% threat reduction, but I still stand by windfury. I never have a problem with threat without the 30%, and warriors are able to generate more threat with extra rage from windfury procs so it balances out
---
That's the third post in a row, people should have got a hint... still 3 whooshes already.
---
It's mostly horror stories from rank 13's going for 14 and losing a full week of grinding because now they cannot be the #1 spot.
---
Or maybe I recognize that a sandbox can have interesting toys in it while STILL having sand.
---
Er, well with people quitting and no longer paying it should absolutely be their fucking problem to fix. Why would you wait until AFTER an unhappy group of customers leave before trying to fix things. That's just fucking stupid as it becomes a lot harder to convince them to come back and start paying you again.
---
Read my other reply; cops do not give warnings for breaking the law. They write tickets and arrest people. Ignorance isn’t an excuse to break the rules.
---
Divide that by 40 and yes.
---
I’m a feral Druid and i approve of this message👍🏻
---
Especially if you’re rolling on items that are not your role in the party
---
yeah but it will give them something to do
---
Strange.. I just took a break to eat something, but for the past 6 hours I've been grinding honor and had zero chat lag.
---
I have an ally toon at 60 on the realm.
---
Never watched him before but I can say I thoroughly enjoyed this video. Great content, wholesome as fuck.
---
Yeah, it is a collaboration between the tank and the group. Some ppl don't understand that. It's probably more important when you are a prot pally. I guess if people expect you to tank as a warrior it goes wrong. When I run with good players who understand the mechanics, everything is fine:)
---
You think you want it, but you don't.
---
Finally some Imbued Plate Armor up in here
---
I wouldn't be that hyperbolic. There's just a lot of people that want to play pve that rolled on a pvp server for whatever reason. I love PvP personally so when I get ganked I go and get a group and do some pvp. That's the main reason I rolled on a pvp server.
---
Wait, so you have your own census data, but you are refusing to post it and are asking OP to guess instead? Do I have that right?
---
I'm not playing classic WoW and I just found this through /r/popular.
---
From what I'm reading though, this is exactly how it was in vanilla WoW, down to people telling you to reroll on a PvE server.  There used to be nightly battles to take on Tarren Mill and Southshore on my server (Bleeding Hollow).  Other zones would get some 60s to go grief some lower levels, sure enough some 60 Alliance players would show up, soon enough you'd have a battle.
---
I don't know all the specifics because I'm not playing anymore and haven't since Wrath, but from everything I'm reading, this is a very similar experience to vanilla servers.
---
FWIW, I played entirely on PvP servers back in the day.  If I played today, I'd play on PvE.
---
don't forget the nice abilities you get from warmode... that you could argue should be part of the base character anyways, but hey
---
After leveling a warrior solo without dungeons grind I feel him.
---
WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?
---
Has the bug where you report something in chat and it deletes the last minute or so from your chat log been a thing for a while too? Pretty annoying.
---
I mean, Your entitled to your opinion. Even if it is wrong.
---
Hmm, that may be. I am certainly biased, but what I remember from the pre-BG phase are the battles in Hillsbrad foothills. Not the bullshit ganking groups avoiding similar groups of the other faction.
---
What can I say, no R14 for this casual.
---
Some of them run shadow reflector and it’s actually GG
---
I'm pretty sure folks were doing this in the original game.  Also I'm not quite sure what you'd expect Blizzard to do about faction imbalance - you can't force players to pick a faction.  If you don't want PvP then stop your bitching and roll on a PvE server.
---
Man I have no regrets rolling on a PvE server. I'm having a blast while the PvP servers are a shit show.
---
The 2nd and so on during one day makes each DK more impactful.
---
Yep, as a Hunter I got hit with the “dude you need to be sniping the eyes!” Like fucking what? My pet is away and I’m just standing here desperately trying to not accidentally pull something or mess up and you’re assuming I’m just going to target a random enemy and fire away lol. If you want me to do something then please just explain it to me but I’ve mentioned several times that I haven’t done a tribute run before.
---
But hey, learning experience, and now I know. Planning to try to solo it soon.
---
Don’t forget to add flair.................
---
When using the mobile Reddit website, you can’t even post anything because there isn’t an option to add flair. 
---
So the flair rule prevents people posting fresh content from their phone. 
---
Absurd....
---
Shit you in the fuk?
---
That's an interesting point and if you enjoy them more power to you!
---
Truth. But warriors can tank and mages bring ranged + Aoe so both still have an easier time getting into groups
---
We were here in the leadup to the game. This sub was fucking spicy when the game was launching because we had all the vets here who didn't mind calling Blizz's crap out. The discussions on layering when it first came out was hilarious, this sub was ready to hang blizzard by the neck en masse. We just leave cause it gets tiring hearing 20x a day "lol just unsub if you dont like it".
---
I pop in now and again to see how it's doing, play a little every patch drop cause I got the free sub now, and it just gets more like r/wow every time. If you dare critique it, just swarmed and told to quit. Well...we do...and we play games like PoE where the devs actually listen and passion is encouraged, not stifled, y'know?
---
There’s literally a post every day of GMs issuing warnings to rooftop campers.
---
Classic isn't being rushed, people have been logging in once a week for 2 hour raids for a while now lmao. Game's dead unless you pvp.
---
I always thought guards would eventually glitch their way to you, or spawn around you
---
I would like to welcome everyone to classic. This was in game back in vanilla and yes is still around in classic. No one got banned back then and wont get banned for it now. Enjoy!
---
DKP Is a separately tracked (i.e. not in game) "currency" used by guilds for raid loot distribution. Guild supporting activities like time raiding, killing bosses, going to guild events, farming consumables etc. can earn you this currency, which you then spend in raid to get an item you want.
---
Did... you... actually think it was faked?
---
You shouldn't be that upset about the people camping BRM.
---
You know why? Because they're all genuinely terrible at pvp. It's easy for them right now because they're vastly outnumbering everyone, but if you catch any of these people out by themselves before the hoard (no pun intended) shows up they drop so fast, the only reason these people are even managing to get kills is because of the overwhelming #s.
---
You know why shouldn't be upset though, because these "try hards" who are sitting there 12 hours a day grinding out honor will likely be the same people queing up for BGs. Which makes for the EASIEST wins ever. I've found that the moment you can get an equal # battle, the win rates with these folks  is phenomenally in  your favor. Sure eventually you simply get overran, but the vast majority of these people are just plain bad. 
---
I'm very much looking forward to the 10th when all these wannabes que up for BGs and simply get creamed because the have no capability outside of #s.
---
Speaking as a warlock, rogues are bullshit. I should write a post
---
Please tell me how I'm wrong.
---
Yes. The overall population on the WoW census  combines every region. 
---
Go tally up the numbers for NA realms and get back to me.
---
As a protection paladin I farm undead at one of the farms in WPL. Consecration + reflect gear does a ton of aoe damage. If you’re a Druid or warrior, you could single target farm the bats in EPL while passively mining. The bats drop a lot of greys worth around 20s each.
---
Don’t play on PvP servers, problem solved.
---
huh? right click report is what you have to do, though
---
You're actually clueless yet keep talking like you have a clue. This is impressive.
---
Darkshore has way more quests than westfall and theyre closer to each other. Its worth the run.
---
Yeah, sadly I only started playing wow a month ago and I had gotten my toon to 40 before honor hit and made it hard to level so I made an alt on a pvp server last week.
---
"Anyone who has had a experience differing from mine means they are a liar liar pants on fire."
---
Alrighty then.
---
It ain’t that easy though because hit and crit are a double roll. Have to roll to hit the target before the roll to crit the target
---
Well, are you paying?
---
You call for Honor when it suits you Little Lion...
---
He's a druid.
---
How do you die to dots as a mage? You have two ice blocks and two frost barriers to use...
---
I kept picking the mail armor rewards on my human mage because it had more armor. And I didn't know why I couldn't wear it.
---
No, it certainly happened. I just think the mentality has changed a lot; for one, min-maxing was not a thing for most people, at least not in my memory.
---
If you want to play rogue in raids make one on PvE servers, having real trouble recruiting the amount of rogues i'd like.
---
More facts
---
Fresh meat
---
No classic is not nochanges. Vanilla server populations were never this large, and faction imbalance was never this crazy. Layering was also never a thing.
---
I have been in the guild I’m with since I joined the server, I heard it would be hard so I thought ahead, thank you!
---
Have had people abusing, botters, and people spamming as if they were an admin for months now. Blizzard isn't doing shit as long as they have a sub.
---
I've seen the same exact one too, not gonna spend time looking for it, u can do it
---
They downvote you but you aren’t wrong lol
---
The community isn’t one person with one opinion. Many many people in the community mentioned the warts, and how we didn’t want them, and there’s absolutely no reason we should just live with them.
---
Keep in mind I’m not saying we should go start changing things that actually matter. Things that are crucial to what makes vanilla, vanilla. Keep that. But roof camping? Considering it’s explicitly against the rules and a bannable offense, this absolutely fights not qualify as something that should be kept.
---
My bad lol
---
Man, showcasing exploits like this only damages the game, all for you to get likes and subscriptions.
---
No idea about how long thats been in the game.
---
Y’all want pvp so bad though
---
community was better also ;/
---
You have to right click report for cheating and explain that they are" safespotting"
---
funny how wrath babies talk out their ass as if people didn't already raidlog back in the day, and knew everything from just googling
---
Yet somehow response times were that fast when 12 million people played wow.
---
One dps warrior in my guild is on his 115+ runs for hoj. If not a ton more at this point. He’s a meme for us. All he asks about is brd runs
---
Your comparing real life crimes to standing on a roof on a video game.
---
&gt;cops do not give warnings for breaking the law.
---
In what world do you live in? Cops give warning ALL the time for breaking laws. This was so stupid to say, its funny.
---
&gt;Ignorance isn’t an excuse to break the rules.
---
Yes, for obvious things. Just how you know not to murder irl, you know not to bot in wow. But standing on a roof (which is easily climbable)  is on par with jaywalking, or not registering your dogs in mandatory states.
---
Ignorance is a VERY good excuse for breaking laws, outside of the obvious bad ones, murder, robbery, kidnapping, fucking kids etc.
---
Every comment you comment back is more and more stupid than the next. I understand you have fairy tale thought process, but the world isnt as black and white as you think.
---
That is true for me  I don't plan to rank but can't imagine being on a PVE realm.  I chose not to roll on a high pop streamer server though as I wanted population levels to be blizz-like.  I am level 52 and have been ganked by ONE level 60.  The first week I expect was the worst on big servers, but so was the questing experience on launch.  Most servers are fine now, but it seems that the majority of players are on just a few realms, making them overpopulated.
---
If I’ve already found a guild, built a great relationship with them, and We’ve only started raiding last week. Would this help my case?
---
It doesn't. Come to 99% logs and then tell me that again.
---
WF does not increase the tank damage by 30%. WF also benefits DPS a lot more than tanks.
---
Ok just like they didn't in vanilla?
---
Not if you only made them use the rifles if the target is unreachable
---
That is a damn good point, it would be unfair for those that slaughtered countless players just to get into a instance or raid just to have some people move over decked out in full BiS gear that didn’t put that type of work in
---
it's almost as if the game has a very outdated design, wowee
---
ya! BADASS, AWESOME hehe xDD
---
People are more worried about every raid team on the server trying to farm one mob.  With enough guilds they may not see BWL first weeks. Smart thing would be to group up middle of the night for less competition.
---
I think it helps a lot. But still need that 60 fast.
---
You: "There aren't enough tanks for my pug"
---
Also you: "lol you can't have greens I don't need in exchange for your help doing something you don't need."
---
You have any idea how hard it is to farm 30g/hr on a tank? Vs the 100g/hr you can farm as a warlock...
---
It's crazy you can't let greens go to a tank if you need a 5man tanked. You'd probably only win 1 or 2 of them so what's the harm in just passing? 3g?
---
You're garbage.
---
Kick them from the disc.... 
---
How is this a thing?
---
I raided AQ40 back in classic with my friend’s guild. It wasn’t that bad. They weren’t that tryhard and I was 13.
---
Naxx was only out for 5 months and 20ish days before TBC dropped and people had full cleared it in just over 2 months. Most people couldn’t get past certain parts because they didn’t know mechanics and the resources as weren’t widely available back then. I’ll be laughing when Naxx is cleared within a week now because everyone has all the resources right there.
---
Most people are basing their perceptions on private servers, which were actually overtuned as hell with bugs like enemies double attacking and crushing blows from enemies that shouldn’t be able to hit crushing blows because the mechanic was not programmed right, and literally nobody ever talked about how bad even the biggest private servers were. They were just happy to play vanilla. (I know this is a sore subject and people hate when I point out how bugged private servers are.)
---
Can confirm that they're on Mankrik Horde
---
If I were to teleport an army of level 1s into brm and had them just stand around, would all the PvP stop?
---
Even if the ceos invested more money do you want one gm for every person so there are no wait times? No because that is unrealistic and stupid as is your reasoning. 
---
I hate capitalism and big business for the most part but you have to pick your battles. You can’t just say blizzard bad because they don’t hire an insane amount of people as gms and they give themselves bonuses or whatever. Most business do this but it’s not a constructive argument. Nor is it the bases for an entire argument as other companies run better even with this shady shit.
---
You could point out that there have been unnecessary layoffs for gms and cs reps or that the ceos are mismanaging their company (which let’s not kid ourselves the amount of mistakes blizzards higher ups make is staggering) but instead you just blindly insult with no kind of base for your argument and you insulted the other poster another sure fire way to make you look like an absolutely asshole.
---
What class are you playing? Mage? Frostbolt. Warlock? Shadow bolt.
---

---
You're delusional
---
I see your point, and as a current CS tech at a large company, I think I got defensive lol
---
I don’t care honestly. The screenshot feel fake to me. Beside that, it could happens to anyone because of how the game and loots work. There are odds, I wont argue with anyone. Anyone that come to me and tell me: “hey, this thing just happen to me” I’d believe this person and be happy for them, if they lie, I don’t care cuz it wont change shit to my day. If they don’t lie, this is fucking awesome and I’m happy for them. I just don’t care more than that. 
---
About the picture: the space between each loot is unequal and look weird, his chat also look weird (I have chat add-ons so I can’t compare, I don’t even remember the original chat, it can explain why I don’t like it) 
---
So, while it “look fake”, that doesn’t mean its “fake”. Are we done with this childish debate ? Don’t you see what I mean ?
---
Edit: space are equal, it just the green loot that make it weird when In saw it first. It doesn’t look that weird now that I analyses it
---
Double edit: it doesn’t look weird at all. I just did a quick peeks at first.
---
ban them from disc, where is the problem?
---
Suck it up. I as a horde player have to deal with it to at the Crossroads. Don't like it? Turn off warmode
---
Trying to create an alt to get to 35 as an alchemy alt.
---
Any recommendation on what class levels the fastest to 35?
---
We have never kicked anybody. Never felt the need to be honest. It was not an acrimonious break up. 4 people left for another guild. Shit happens. 1am ganging up on a lone female is not a normal thing!
---
It’s only NPC that are affected heh.
---
Level 1’s just won’t make any difference
---
We have a legit shaman tank in our guild who is doing everything he can to get one of these for his tanking set.
---
I'm more concerned about Horde limiting access and ally not even getting a sniff for 12 hrs.
---
Completely different games. Also you're comparing real people to fucking npcs in a game. Idc what you play or who you are, if you think this sort of behaviour is healthy for the pvp setting, then you're part of the problem. Christ you're dense.
---
No.  Because lvl 1’s don’t give Dk’s.
---
What site do you have that is any better or is all your info anecdotal? Just curious because I dont see anything else.
---
It's fine for you to wait. But you can't come here throwing shade at people making gold the way you can. Don't get butthurt when people disagree with your callout
---
It's like I told the support ticket i submitted, make it possible for pvp servers to transfer to pve ones or I'm not resubbing.
---
Your fault for using the boat!!!
---
Get rid of the pugs. Only way to have any ground to stand on.
---
/#nochanges, no matter what, we have to keep everything the same to relive the experience!
---
Good thing you pointed out its a female, if it was a male this would be completely okey.
---

BUCKET
---
It shouldn’t take that long. The difference between a bis and non bis level appropriate piece of gear is like 1 dps in most cases. If you have hit cap and appropriate stats, you’ll be fine.
---
Hit cap was always the mechanic that showed the difference between low knowledge and high knowledge players. Makes more of a difference in raiding than like 5 strength.
---
Guards just need their ranges increased 10 fold. I shouldnt be getting killed in towns or hubs because they arent within 5 feet of a guard to retaliate.
---
Its because I am unsure. It definietly FEELS like cheating. But on a technical level, i dont think it actually is. 
---
Its like if in CS there was a log for the actual coordinates of every player on the map. Sure you know everything using that, but no one is going to actually beable to read that AND be able to play the game. And if there was an addon for CS that translated those coordinates onto the minimap, would that be cheating? Technically no, but realistically it gives a massive advatage to the players who have the addon, vs the ones who dont.
---
Of course it doesn't increase their damage by 30%, it just gives them exponentially more rage for more sunders and other high threat moves, allowing them to generate way more threat
---
I definitely wouldn't mind a perditions, if just for pvp.
---
Ahh the classic experience
---
Just buy a normal invis 18s pot, it shouldn’t be much more expensive and works even if you accidentally fat finger something.
---
Yeah, pallies can get by with AoE farming, no doubt. But killing those bats that are fairly largely spaced apart...? Uh yeah... even if I'm out farming thorium in EPL, I'm definitely not going to stop and do that. It's absolutely not worth the time to dismount, kill, loot, and start looking for the next thorium. It also puts me in one of the most contested zones where literally any other player can kill me as a tank because we're worse off than even healers in PvP.
---
"Hah, silly warrior... You can just kill the random mobs around a giant contested murder zone for scraps to sell!"
---
Reinstall windows
---
This is a useless comment. Shut the fuck up.
---
So what exactly were you looking for here? There are shitty people everywhere man. Classic isn't some haven of perfect people. Like everyone else has said, mute/ban them and move on.
---
A typo
---
Its only illegal if alliance stands on top of roofs din you know that? Typical horde favoritism. /s
---
Better get that flying mount quick.
---
Here's the first time to ban some people for a good reason.
---
also the GM should have just banned them straight, or just go offline if she didn't wanna for some reason.
---
Your are just being a lazy entitled fuck, i play a rogue and i don't "farm", i make decent gold per hour (and consumables) fishing and herbing. How about with the amount of engies around mining would be decent (not to mention the price of crystals) or mara farm which is lucrative?. But nope you would rather bitch and moan, i've heard the same bs from so many prot warriors who just sit in org trying to sell them selves and no i am not complaining about your services.
---
I get you wanting to make this video but why wouldn't you just fly to burning steppes? A lot of horde don't even bother with thorium point just for the off chance its being camped and either just ride from kargath or go to burning steppes.
---
Why should people not in the guild be in the discord?
---
The town's can have that many people together concurrently
---
By that logic the first guild wars wasn't an MMO, or half the MMOs on the market
---
I do get the point of rule 7 and during the first couple weeks it was a good idea but the idea is to keep repetitive low effort content off the sub, but if i looked for an hour i could probably find 60 posts of someones guild in front of rags corpse because it was their first kill. I dont want 5 posts a day using the same meme format either, its not as cut and dry as some people would like to pretend it is
---
You sound like a ton of fun to do dungeons with, lol.
---
Personally if people are doing their hardest to grab aggro I just chill and let them die, not kick them :P
---
Only for alliance. If it was an alli doing that he wld be banned in seconds.
---
It looks like you asked for more animal facts! The Komodo dragon is the largest type of lizard, growing up to 3 meters (10 feet) in length.
---
I don’t remotely agree, and your analogy doesn’t work.
---
This is a multiplayer video game. One would safely assume things that you can actually do in the game are OK things to do. You would assume they would make it impossible to do things that you’re not supposed to do. Some of these exploits you could easily get yourself into too, it goes beyond roof camping. Just being in the corner of the inn in gagetzan will keep you from being attacked by guards but you can still attack the other faction. That too is bannable. It’s reasonable to not realize this isn’t ok. 
---
Conversely, we educate our society on what’s illegal. Police don’t expect you to read some Society terms of service. Laws are considered either common knowledge, or common sense. And we teach our children how to properly live in society. It is not reasonable to not be aware of what’s illegal. And in instances where it is deemed reasonable... Cops absolutely do give warnings sometimes!
---
WoW is not real life.
---
Interesting I didn't know pallies had a different spell on ally vs horde.
---
Your GM doesn't have discord rights?
---
2 grown men should not be abusing a lone female in my books. Just sad. Will they have enough sack to come on at prime time? Doubt it.
---
3 warr's with 2 bindings GTFO.... Oof
---
Remindme! 90 days
---
It's a balanced medium pop realm with active cities, problem is alot of the horde love honor farming so at the moment there isn't anything you can do in late game zones. I am also only raid logging atm and waiting for the release of battlegrounds. IMHO there is too many ppl on ashbringer since you can still get killed by a rogue in a capital city like ironforge or stormwind.
---
It’s a private forum for communication. If someone comes and acts I a way that is at odds with your groups norms... you ban them. 
---
The facts that someone’s a woman or that they downed Rag or blah blah blah mean less than nothing.
---
Ban them.
---
Do i have to link you that south park episode for you to watch again?
---
If he pk’s in osrs he definitely wants to play a class with burst. Osrs pking revolves around specing at the perfect time for a ko. Warrior, shaman, or even ret paladin could work for this.
---
Perma ban a few and the others will never dare do such a thing.
---
I started arena to anger runs at 52 and leveled to 57 only doing those runs before I gave up. Some things the game does not want you to have.
---
orcs and trolls are so badass :) true
---
Except it did happen and it was likely removed for the same thing, rule 7.
---
We’re all gettin ganked, turn down the suck &amp; start ganking back or kick rocks buddy.
---
Tons of people have been removed from their guild and even keep tabs on people who have done this to let other guilds know.  Hell I just recently let someone in my guild and within the next hour I had a mail in my box about the player, went in the discord with the guy and he showed proof and then we just talked about it lol
---
That rood is reachable via the hill behind it just by jumping on top, they may give him a warning but that's been an arguement for a long time since you don't have to exploit to get up there
---
I don’t think male or female it makes a difference. Equality and all, you know. But couldn’t she just leave discord, mute them,  ignore them?
---
This is beautiful
---
You seem mad, have a snickers.
---
Horde players enjoy PvP and find joy in ruining an Alliance players day. They love seeing all of the Ally constantly complaining about getting killed. Probably deep-rooted revenge that turned into hatred of a faction.
---
Sure would be a shame if all those people camping Menethil and other towns got DKs and lost honor...
---
isnt there an shadow reflection engineer trinket? might help abit.
---
Kek
---
Make it so you can't go on the roof?
---
One dk is 2-3%
---
They had some INSANE rng. They are funneling every arcanite bar and Crystal from the entire guild for later.
---
Or, you can them and move on from those losers.
---
Not my fault you rolled on a PvP server and wish you went PvE. This is how it was in 04 and its NEVER GOING TO CHANGE.
---
Also, if I was Horde. I would definitely do the same stuff to you. You're so triggered over your server choice of PvP. Who seriously expects a Hello Kitty Island Adventure on a PvP server.
---
They could. But being a responsible gm was trying to find out what their beef was. Turns out they just c#%¥’s.
---
If that worked, we'd have already seen it.
---
A decade ago.
---
Is he related to Griftah by any chance? :)
---
You would have to perm enough people to make it an "internet issue" though.
---
That being said theres no reason why major exploits would be warnings, and roof camping would be perm :P
---
Same for me, H is right above B. Coincidentally, blessing of freedom was changed to hand of freedom but that was around wotlk.
---
&gt; one Gnome
---
&gt; 40 Horde inbetween Kargath and BRM
---
Same thing.
---
the way i understood it is even if you are not affected by this (i.e you're horde) you should still report your fellow players
---
Reread my comment lol that’s a start. I also played vanilla and while raids happened and you’d get camped in areas once in a while it was nothing like what people are experiencing right now.
---
The thing that sticks out to me. When you say you want the "good stuff". It suggests to me that you want the weapons. Like the Krol Blade, Staff of Dominance, etc etc. Which happen to be the most expensive and most coveted items in the game.
---
It also sounds to me like you want to get them quickly but without having to go through a typical guild's trial period. And I don't think that's all that fair against the established raiders who've been building up DKP points or EPGP, which you see to recognize.
---
You made it clear. You're not here to make friends(or at least, just casual "hi" and "bye" stuff). You're just here for loot. I suppose that's fine, but unfortunately you kind of fit the profile of someone who'll dash and run the moment you get what you want. 
---
You should just pug it. There are tons of MC/Onyxia pugs that now run consistently every week. I even see them on Wed/Thurs when the core raiders finish them on one night. Pugs let you just free roll on the loot, with no DKP systems, no seniority, no nothing. Everyone has equal chance on that loot.
---
On my server regular pug raids are clearing MC on their established nights, maybe not as fast as dedicated guilds, but they are clearing it all the same. I'm actually a little surprised that you're here asking this type of question to be totally honest. You seem to understand all the pros and cons of being in a guild but yet don't want be in one. You want to have it both ways.
---
You say that you're in all pre-raid BIS. And it took only a few weeks to get them all. This further suggests to me that you've put in the time(quite a lot of time I might add) with other party members and surely got to know some people who you consistently run with? So what's the issue with raiding with some of these other guys? That they're in established guilds and you want to run, but yet you don't want to be associated with a larger group?
---
You said it yourself. Pugging it is fine for the here and now, and maybe it'll even be fine when Blackwing Lair drops, but what will you do when AQ40 and Naxx debut? Can you be truly confident that you can just pug AQ40, week after week? Or would you far more likely be stuck in tier 1/2 content, because you're not in a guild?
---
The answer is clear. You either accept that your progress will be capped after a certain point and be a free agent, or you accept the (what seems to be a sacrifice to you) and just join a guild.
---
It's strange to me you do seem to understand the what/where/why of why guilds do what they do. But you don't want to play ball. Maybe you should find a guild that does gold-based DKP system. If you're unfamilar with that, take a deeper dive into it.

The overuse of cooldowns for every damn thing.

Sapper charges. Fuck me I've never been bombed so much on my life. Definitely a good tactic alot more people adapted. Or atleast the try hards.
---
You and fucking Marc Rutzou
---
Would still rather suffer through this than past retail.
---
Actually most of us dont care to wait so were not being screwed over.  Thats a personal problem for you bud if you were horde.
---
Yup, because I knew what to expect lol
---
Fuck that takes some balls to aoe there as horde...
---
Well, we aren't in the tokens phase yet and the plate pieces that do drop are tank based, not dps.  Bis, including raid gear has a lot of blue for fury warriors.  So 'gearing the main tank first' isn't excluding the dps.  They are separate gear tracks in T1 itemization.
---
It's not, though. Horde objectivity have the better racials, more convenient flight paths and safer cross continent transport. They also have multiple core dungeons in uncontested territory (SM, WC, RFD, RFK, SFK)
---
That is not opinion, it is literally fact.
---
What do you consider “full resist”? I can’t attest for “chance to land” part of this but the partial resist part is incorrect.
---
 Of the resistances, shadow resist is definitely the worst in terms of usefulness in stacking, but I wouldn’t call it bugged. With enough resist, you can certainly partially resist the DoT, but you have to partially resist the initial cast. The game decides whether you resisted the initial DoT, then that coefficient remains for the remainder of the DoTs life. Any recast would change that. Every DoT tick is NOT a new chance to resist. That goes for spells like Mind Flay as well, as it’s treated as a DoT in the game.
---
(Source: I did my own testing of these sorts of things when making different gear sets for duels. I was running about 200 resist)
---
It really isn't vanilla. I quit classic because all the same toxic mentality of retail is in Classic. You hear people talk about BiS sets, and dungeon spam leveling, and maximizing dps and other shit that wasn't classic. It's not the same. At all. 
---
It's dead to me and left the game.
---
That you had weakened mp5 when standing. I would sit when I wasn’t casting heals until I realized it didn’t do anything approximately 60 levels later
---
20 people from each side would still be up to 80 kills (with diminishing returns).  Even if you just got everyone once that would be 4k per day.
---
You can't pummel through LIP
---
Even if it means looking for member, that doesn't change anything. Unless you mean that LFM means you just need one more member?
---
“Honor is dead, but I’ll see what I can do.”
---
Pvp isn't griefing.
---
I won't be for much longer if things don't improve.
---
But the pet shouldn't be in actual combat flag right? Because it obeys the PvP flag if it's master and since it hasn't made contact yet with the player then it's just walking at that point. I get why it would be "in combat" once the AI command to attack is set but to me there has to be some distinction with player pet vs regular mobs.
---
So go ahead. Try to build a whole raiding guild in an evening.
---
Didnt they fix this by pvp being toggled off until you hit a certain level? Or did they really do full out day 1 classic wow without any of the QoL updates?
---
Rhok is nothing special just a 2 phase BiS for Hunters.. the problem I see is that every week he’s rolling against a new set of PuGs, why is this even happening?
---
The Hunter is straight up better off finding a guild that gives a shit. One that has consistent players so if he loses the leaf to one or two hunters they aren’t constantly rolling against him the next week.
---
If the RL doesn’t get that then why stick around?
---
Like arguing with a wall
---
OP classic isn’t that hard. But raiding guilds live and die based on how comfortable players are within the guild. If You and friends don’t like the GM regardless of why, you should leave. End of story. And there WILL be plenty of guilds dissolving over time to assimilate. Hell, arguably the top US alliance guild just transferred off of my server, leaving a couple A team raiders behind who need a home. And shit like that’s not weird, it happens all the time. 
---
But realistically this should be solved in house. Speak to your GM about the bonus and not reddit. I’m sure he’d be reasonable.
---
And whomever I’m responding to, you might enjoy the game a little more if you spent less time on YouTube and more time playing it. 🤣
---
Whaaa I’m playing on a PvP server/using war mode and am encounter PvP. Daddy blizz plz make it stop. 
---
Welcome to PvP where anything goes and your feeling don’t matter. Scrub
---
Feralas and tanaris lately
---
EPL, BRM of course, hell even theramore and menethil, try landing at the fp without getting camped by a group. Unless I play at 4am server or bring a full group with me, it's essentially impossible to collect herbs without getting camped by full groups/raids in any of the 50+ zones. I'm curious how cheap the prices are on horde side for herbs when they control literally every zone.
---
It's funny, I ran strat 41 times to get my pants, and it dropped on 19 of those runs.
---
I only saw my dress once (nabbed it) and I've never seen the gloves 
---
I think the game actively plots against you
---
I too only plan for a perfect run and don't bring consumables to help avoid a wipe.  If a wipe happens, it's never my fault and fuck those guys for screwing up.  Why should I bring things that can help recover and save an attempt?  It's their fault!
---
And clearly they're doing nothing to solve the problems.
---
as Ion said, the complaints mirror the complaints back in vanilla.
---
If this is your first toon I highly recommend rerolling to a pve server. You don’t have to deal with the assholes camping in towns, when you hit 50 you can actually quest, STV isn’t Vietnam2.0 and you can just do battlegrounds or flag yourself if you want pvp.
---
It's already gone with server sizes. High pop was 3k-4k. Now it's like 12k.
---
continue to raid log and not worry about it
---
I play on a quiet balanced server, but I don't log on.
---
I'm not keen on the only way to pvp progress is to be an arse hole, as there is never any engaging player driven pvp activities.
---
I'm not keen on being out numbered ganked when I'm grinding.
---
I'm not keen on my request for help being ignored.
---
I'm not keen on levelling an alt. Classic is still as gradual as it was and I'm tired of it. Got two 60s in vanilla and one 55. Got one 60 in this Classic. Oddly I feel burned out somewhat.
---
I want the BGs to be out so that I can casually PvP.
---
(I'm not raiding as I've *done* classic raiding and my life cannot support it)
---
That is a valid point, and I agree that everyone is free to act as they please. And sure, I don't do it in order to get the same treatment back and get sour over it if I don't.
---
That said, I just think that there is no need to be a dick; if your victim has absolutely no chance at winning the fight due to the level difference, it is not an honourable one.
---
They can’t take a ticket at face value. I have plenty of users on my systems that essentially lie or their experience they wrote in about was not in fact what occurred. Investigation required.
---
Resists in PvP are much more rare than in PvE (calculated differently). And rank 1 frostbolt has a very fast casting time.
---
People said the same thing about MC before Classic came out. I heard lots of "we never even got past the first trash pull" and stories about wiping for hours on easy bosses. 
---
The game is just different now. Players knowing everything and understanding raiding has made all raids easy. Naxx on private servers (which are generally tuned harder than Classic has been) does not pose a guild-killing challenge. People are going to clear huge swaths of it early and any competent guild by modern standards will kill KT.
---
It was far less toxic and griefbased. No one farmed people for honor the way they do today.
---
Except that’s patently false. 
---
High population and layering were added in order to prevent against servers from hitting a critically low population too soon after launch, and then requiring server mergers. Not only did the populations on servers not die down even remotely close to as quickly as they expected... But server mergers would have been a better, and more vanilla, way to go anyways.
---
Beyond this, the incredibly high populations is what has made the faction imbalance SOOOOOOO much worse for the alliance... Which is making them quit, making the imbalance even worse. 
---
There’s absolutely no reason they did it this way, in fact there’s only reasons they shouldn’t have.
---
As had been stated it's either em or ns
---
Obviously choose based on your play style but I always personally have ns. The ability to decide if I want to use it offensively or defensively is the deciding factor for me
---
I also wish Warriors could charge in defensive stance! Better yet I wish they combined charge and intercept into the same button that could be used in any stance! And pummel! Let that be used in any stance as well! In fact lets let every ability be used in every stance! 
---
Actually instead of having stance gated abilities, lets just make stances have simple stat modifiers!
---
I was only like level 43-45 ish when it released in vanilla, I went to south shore and healed people in the war pushing back and forth for a day or two, then went back to questing, and there was more fighting, but it was generally between other people questing. The occasional 60 would run you over, but I was still able to play the game.
---
You want to bang on about me but you don't want me guessing how you play? What a joke. First i play combat daggers, no stealth talents (it's pretty useless), mobs arn't easy, it takes hours to find groups outside of guild, no loot is given to me (tanks get funneled), i farm for our tanks and send them consumables (i get nothing given to me). I never use stealth when im herbing, i get ganked constantly by everyone because i am a squishy rogue riding around on a mount not stealthed and when i am picking flowers what a shock i am not stealthed and normally get someone ganking me. And as i am typing this (sitting in stealth) i get ganked by 3 people, what a suprise. Lastly it's next to impossible to kill a prot warrior, 500 crit backstabs really make you shake!

If people would open their eyes and realize that there will never be a fair fight in PvP. People will screech at someone having bombs, a health pot, a whipper root. Multiple people jumping on you, the second you go for revenge.

People are being delusional and thinking. They will always have it their way, PvP being fair. It's never going to happen. Even if you were on a PvE server with Battlegrounds out. There'd be another reason to screech.

I've just heard that this is the most common loot method in Korea (unverified).

It sounds like a pretty good system. I would be fine with it.  It rewards showing up and if you really want an item you can have it if you have the gold.
---
Each person probably got 20 honor total from this. Totally worth it!

At this point, idk why they aren't fucking doing anything about Faction inbalance... Look at the charts Blizzard! Horde is dominating most servers with a 70-30 ratio! FFS...

Paladin with mortal strike and a taunt sounds like it'd be godly.

Or double down on the caster side of things and grab holy nova, smite, and some other shit from priest to actually function as spellpower dps without using MCP

PvP on a pvp swerved?!!!?!! Wow.  Totally unplayable.

No one reads law books either.
---
I'd love to agree with you, but not necessarily. That database has very few datasets for the past 2 weeks. It's also only counting how many of one faction are online at one time.. doesn't pair data points for each faction at a specific time, and is grossly discontinuous. It really doesn't tell you anything about the past couple of weeks.
---
Can't know too much about the methods of the OP, but they give specific faction population decreases over the previous 2 week period (used at least 2 time controlled datasets). You can't really get that wrong without straight up lying...
---
These are handled case-by-case, but this is against ToS.  Usually it's a warning first, then further action on repeated offense.
---
Game masters are low in population compared to the amount of players, even more now.  Takes some time for them to investigate the issue.  I would suggest moving to another area and/or taking a break.  
---
Sucks, I've been there even on my 60...can be quite frustrating.
---
My guess is the complaints are probably the same, but it’s much worse now than it was then.
---
It was. I was there. I played it. It was. 
---
This thread is hilarious. All these same complaints were made back in vanilla and back then the response was "pvp happened on a pvp server". The devs even encouraged it.
---
This is the reason I played on pve servers only.
---
Seems complicated. Should a super casual player look for guild that use rolls instead?
---
On my server its the Alliance doing that
---
I started playing in TBC and so far on my server (Atiesh PvE) it feels *really* close to the same. I’m even leveling the same first character I leveled back then.
---
The community on my server is great. It’s mostly the PvP servers that have gone to hell in the past month.
---
Can you dig up this interview? I think BC/Wotlk confirmed would be pretty huge news here. I'd be mortified - others would be ecstatic
---
What exactly is your point? Are you comparing standing on a roof in a video game to breaking laws in real life?
---
I hate to beat a dead horse, but there’s not much of a discussion here. 
---
People being dicks is bad. I think most of us agree on that.
---
Let's put elite guards on all alliance boats, and towns, and roads, and you know what? Let's put them in all horde zones too, and you will never have to worry about horde attacking or anyone having fun ever again!
---
/S
---
It wasn't that much drastic based on what we had seen online, but the current situation was expected because the community and mentality have changed:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bc6xq6/the\_argument\_for\_adding\_wsg\_in\_phase\_2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bc6xq6/the_argument_for_adding_wsg_in_phase_2/)
---
It happens, sometimes you don’t get hit. Hell, I have multiple weeks in a row that I’ve pre-potted a GFPP on Rag and didn’t get touched once. RNG is RNG.
---
But it can be handy to have used. If someone accidentally pulls threat and get the raid breathed, you might survive because you have the buff still due to not being targeted in p2.
---
Overall, it’s only like 5-7g. If you’re fretting over that paltry amount, you need to do something other than just afk in town or raid log.
---
I’m comparing two things that aren’t acceptable that are written in rules no one reads.
---
I burnt through more than one mouse 'looking' for that blade
---
The sad thing is that probably wouldn’t be enough for rank 14. We all know that account sharing will happen again by those trying to push the last couple ranks.
---
Unsub or exclusively sit in BGs, anything in the open world as ally on pvp is essentially unplayable and I don't have the time to level another alt in any reasonable time.
---
It's going to be an absolute shitfest, at least on pvp servers
---

Do you understand most of your problems are coming from the fact you are literal minority?

You wanted classic wow and got it. Now youre bitching. Shut up and wait it out like the good ole days.

No dude, it's retail trying to kill this game I read it on the forums
---
I mean no. We have to get up for work at 6 am. We get home from work at 6pm. Many of us play with our kids who have school. 
---
You’re telling us to get different jobs, disrupt our family life and change our sleep schedule because Blizzard broke their game.
---
It’s one thing to suggest people play early in the morning for better farming-that’s always been true- but for you to make it sound like this is a solution to any play- a problem blizzard created- for adults with responsibilities is exactly why the game is going to collapse without a fix.
---
We literally cannot get up to play and we don’t stay up til 3am because we’re not 18 anymore.
---
Hold off for the bgs. It *might* make it better? Relevelling is a big commitment.
---
I think the word unplayable is extreme.
---
I believed for the longest time spirit gear on my rogue increased my energy regen. This was based off of anecdotal evidence of zones transfers on a boat. I would check other players resources after loading the zone. I ALWAYS had more energy. Turned out my PC was just better and I loaded faster so I had been gaining energy marginally longer then the other people near me that also had an energy bar. WHO KNEW?

I thought having a [Lucky Charm] in your bag improved your rolls

It’s a good bet to count on them adding something that will make them a lot of money.

Yeah I regret not playing the month of October... Coulda been 60, but life happens haha. 46-52 is making me not want to play much December especially 50-52 and with all the games I got on sale Black Friday. Getting camped is just not worth it, and I’m a rogue so I can avoid all that but still... Hopefully open server transfers happen and I’ll be happily back to wow. Worst part though is that I don’t let my subscription lapse...

Same here on the Pagle server, there has been 2 undead rogues camping the Defias Traitor that walks to Moonbrook from SH in Westfall not letting Alliance players finish their escort. I understand if it’s just been a couple of hours but it’s been happening for about a week or so now. Blizzard hasn’t done anything about this.
---
I’m sorry but tanks marking every. Single. Mob. Is annoying and makes the dungeon take twice the time. The tank should not be expected to hand-hold this much. If you’re dps and you’re agroing it’s your fault.
---
Lol complain complain complain.
---
1.	Yes, blizzard said that population would be larger, they never said that they intended it to even out due to players quitting. What they said was that in order for layering to be turned off, more people needed to spread out throughout the world so that no one area was too heavily impacted. That took about 1.5 months for most servers with only 2 still being layered a week before phase 2. This is not blizzards fault, and huge subset of players, both alliance and horde, are very happy about the amount of activity in zones. Maybe you’re on an extremely imbalanced server, I’m in a 60/40 horde server and I’ve come across plenty of huge alliance groups every single day. We have good rivalries. Larger realms meant a guarantee that world pvp would be very lively.
---
2.	see 1. Faction imbalance is prevalent, big surprise when it’s a well known fact that horde have Bettrer pvp racials than alliance. It’s like most people who went pvp servers really wanted to max their pvp efforts so they went horde. If your surprised by this, you’re just oblivious to the state of the game.
---
3.	You’re right, after further looking into this they never explicitly said no paid xfers, it was to be considered at max level if server population declined to unhealthy levels. 
---
Of course i like have alliance to play against. Typical of this sub though, you all assume you speak for the vast majority of players, you don’t. I mean, according to this sub you are all going to solely BG once it comes out, so it’ll be like you aren’t there anyways right? Also bgs are cross realm so it doesnt matter if a single server loses large pops of alliance cause bgs will still be playable.
---
Oh yeah and there is a HUGE population on pve servers who literally laughing at all alliance pvp server complainers since they are having the experience you all apparently wanted. 
---
Downvote me to hell lol, I don’t care, it’s just funny seeing so many people complain about a situation they knew could happen. Have fun complaint more! REEEEEEEEEEE
---
@7:30 when Cedx admits lying... real stand-up guy..
---
You're either incredibly naive or never played actual Vanilla.  Or you didn't even play Classic BEFORE Phase 2.  It wasn't this bad at all.  The population is a MAJOR factor without battlegrounds.
---
You seem to think I'm saying you'll never die once battlegrounds are enabled whereas I'm saying it will be severely cut down because majority of the honor grinders won't be camping everyone in the world.
---
Delete your config.wtf file or remove the Graphics Card entry from it.
---
I thought he was referring to the schedule of re released classic
---
Well, that's sad. I am really glad we got to experience a "better" era of MMORPGs.
---
I’m not doing it at all and it annoys me, too. I’d rather people who do it take bans and I think Blizzard acting on it is entirely reasonable and preferable. I also think it’ll basically stop when BG’s come out exactly the same as it did in vanilla.
---
Guessing you think they just laid 800 people because they thought it was funny and not for an actual reason.
---
While leveling, don't worry about it too much. All else equal use a sword. 
---
At 60, if you PvE, this will matter a LOT for DW Fury. Human racial drops your +hit requirement to 6% (from nine) and improves the damage of your glancing blows.
---
I did that as 4 classes (no dungeons, no guides, just questie with hunter, rogue, warrior, warlock) and I got lvl 35 with all of them in about the same time (like a couple of hours difference). For the rogue I bought a set of rare weapons with fiery at 18, for warrior two rare weapons at 18-28 with fiery and for hunter a green BoE every couple of levels until some rare in mid 20s. Also bought some green BoEs for warrior/rogue before the rares.
---
I think at low levels like these class doesnt matter too much and you should just pick the one that seems most fun. Maybe mage aoe farming is a lot better, but didnt try that. The hunter was the most relaxing however. The warrior felt like the best pvp class in 30-35 range which was very fun.
---
I think something you should do is spend last 2-4 levels just killing humanoids for silk so you can level tailoring to get mooncloth cooldown for another passive 2g income. Level with herbing/skinning and go out of your way only for briarthorn/mageroyal for swiftthistle which is the only thing that sells. Ignore the guides for later levels and just spam the detect ud potion until its grey for alchemy levels.
---
I thought that severe camping counted as harassment too. As in making the game unplayable for others. This might be a maybe though since they could technically say go somewhere else.
---
I... Do feel you.. But it feels like your arguments are:
---
-I make less money and should be compensated for doing my job in a dungeon because of this
---
-other people don't need the greens so I should be able to take them for profit (but others wanting the greens for profit doesn't matter) 
---
-everyone else running the dungeon could be farming 30-100g an hour but is here because they want to be. It's fine for their equivilant gph for the run to be 0 and yours to be inflated greatly, because averaging it out they're not losing out that much. 
---
I am sympathetic because... Yeah hard to farm as a warrior, I do agree that dungeon runs are kinda your bread and butter. 
---
But to the same token it's like asking for a raise because someone else got a raise. Not my problem. Personally I would never pay for any class to do their job unless they were over leveled. Or at least if the service was offered to me I can't see myself accepting it. Unless you can solo the instance you're not really running others through. 
---
It just leaves a bad taste in my mouth to know we're all doing our jobs but only one person is getting paid for it.
---
There's things to achieve in the open world, but World pvp make them not seem worth it.
---
I could grind rep but not interested in punctuated corpse runs.
---
Could grind gold but don't want to kill alliance in pre-emptive defence.
---
This train of thought is unironically encouraged all over this sub.
---
You didn’t point out anything that was fact, you commented an opinion at best. If anything you used different reasoning to come to your conclusion. Again, I was comparing the fact that no one knows all the laws IRL, but that’s not an excuse for a warning when you break said law you didn’t know. That’s all I was saying. If you can’t accept that logic then I won’t continue to argue with you, friend. I thought it was a reasonable comparison. I wasn’t comparing a video game to real life, I was comparing rules and ignorance.
---
Orcs in general always want axes unless you are 2h with oeb.
---
Actually, yes!
---
Come play hunter , we love our tier!
---
Your abilities are used by your main hand. So you'll not miss any hits with 6% hit and an axe as orc. 
---
Your auto attacks will miss 19% of the time with your axe at 6% hit vs a level 63 boss mob.
---
Your offhand will miss 22% of hits against the same target with the same 6% hit on gear.
---
Huh? I mean I took logic and philosophy and got pretty good grades. Your fallacies are your own.
---
Edit: no one said anything about perms bans. Slow down. I agreed with your post by the way. It wasn’t an argument.
---
Expect I got camped by a mage on the roof of the building on the left of the entrance. No guards where attacking them.
---
&gt; Someone (one of the devs) talked about this in an interview with shareholders.
---
I'm not calling you out or fact-checking you or anything, but do you (or anyone else) have this interview? Maybe notes from the interview if it wasn't recorded? I'm really curious on what else was covered.
---
The setup I’m suggesting has over 4700 base hp and 17.5% base crit before enchants or talents. 
---
The tier focused setup you’re suggesting has 5300 hp, 10.6% base crit, and about 700 more armor. 
---
You have no idea what you’re talking about.
---
Isn't this almost leterally the plot of a southpark episode ?
---
You sound like a salty noob. It's simple economics really. There is a lack of supply for tanks and there is high demand. Of course this will raise the value of their service. If you don't like it reroll a tank and start charging yourself. You choose to be a useless and replaceable dps.
---
Lmao it’s cute that you think people care about the honor and not just griefing you. This is always what wow world pvp has been and anyone who rolled on a pvp server expecting anything different is an idiot. Your tears fuel me.
---
Burning steps FP is also camped the the zone itself usually isn’t this bad
---
Ok do this
---
Ranged weapons have a 0.5 second cast time whereas throwing weapons don't.
---
Thank you! I was wondering.
---
Blizzard way more concerned about banning players who speak out against dear leader Xinnie the Pooh.
---
Casual life gets rewarded
---
Tips to getting to Bael'gar in BRD with no key with a group of 55-57s? Some of those trash pulls are like 8+ enemies that we couldn't heal through.
---
Edit: we had a pally tanking and a deep holy priest, who has not had issues healing content he is at content level for yet.
---
Try using nvidia geforce to check the status of your video card. Might be a way through that to update the in Game settings. At this point it couldnt hurt to reinstall classic wow
---
Alliance transfers are locked right now
---
I wasnt playing any mmo till classic, nothing comparable- and certainly not retail
---
it's really good, possibly two chatbots tangled up.
---
I suppose that's partially why I asked myself this. I understand not every realm is the same and all but if this was the average experience of players in realms in which the other faction has the majority back then (Not sure what the exact ratio is on this realm but even if it's "just" 1/3rd, that's still a whole lot of players), I would think they would try some kind of fix immediately. 
---
I know I know, I picked a PVP server so PVP is what I can expect. But FP camping and body camping... It just sucks the fun out of it. You don't never stand a chance.
---
It doesnt matter if the tank should be expected to hand-hold or not, and it doesn't matter whose fault it is if dps pulls aggro. Tanks mark targets because it makes their lives easier, plain and simple.
---
Do you read? Obviously the 30 minutes is for if you do Golem Lord and Dark Coffer, but please post a video where you did all four of those faster.
---
It all makes sense. You're a fresh college graduate who took modern neutered versions of philosophy courses. Life will prove to be a better professor of this study, I assure you.
---
22% of faeriina 60s play on easy mode
---
You could always just get people together and get up there ypurself. It's clearly possible. PvP problems require pvp solutions.
---
P.S I don't know what you want Blizz to do about faction imbalance. Bar people from playing Horde?
---
I believe the cap is now 12k. 4 times the original. A server near max cap with a 60-40 faction split is no longer 1200 vs 1700, now it's 4.8k vs 7.2k. For almost all intents and purposes, most ally are outnumbered 2-1
---
Obviously, calls for Blizzard to fix things are falling on deaf ears. I've always hated rolling on PVP servers, and nothing's changed.
---
If no one pushes themselves, then max rank is more attainable.
---
Nothing legit about a shaman "tank".
---
Even if you are correct, which I still disagree since anybody worth their salt can deal with threat without 30% mitigation, windfury is still preferred by the majority
---
I play alliance, and absolutely not.
---
Its okay to fix the bullshit on the roofs, because you technically can't fight back, and it was always considered an exploit.
---
But boat-battles is iconic and was always a part of the game.
---
A ship with *anyone* but passengers on it? Preposterous.
---
You can barely ever even use the Stormwind Flightmaster on my server.
---
As someone new to tanking I can’t stress this enough. If dps are getting aggro is it their fault, especially if they’re attacking mobs that aren’t the focus, which you’ve gained barely any threat on. Do what you can to regain aggro but it’s not your first priority, your job is to protect the healer mostly.
---
Tell me the steps you took in regards to the drivers.
---
Thank you
---
Which is why hit becomes our number one stat later because hit increases your crit. But only 3 pieces have hit for a warlock in phase 2. Ban thok felheart robe and star of mystaria. The sacrificed sp is 22 on sash of whispered secrets. 20 on vectus neck, and 35 on robe of the void. 3% hit does not make up nearly enough to offset 77 spell power. Crit with isb has a spell power equivalent of 12 to 16 depending on amount of warlocks in raid. Hit floats from 7-10 right now, but will be exceptionally better later on.
---
Explain that one to me. You said it, back it up.
---
This one also.
---
YOU said these things
---
Please back both of your statements up. I would love to hear your reasoning. Sorry for being off topic, when i bring up the things *you* said.
---
why is the mage counter player talkin shit about mages
---
In vanilla everyone played what they felt like. In classic the focus is min/Max and it hurts the game imo. 'lol are you a human priest? Trash only drawrfs are viable' or 'why need? It's not even your prerakid BIS'.
---
I stopped playing. The new HK farm is to have a ranged horde attack an alliance in any city so the guards run to him, then a second horde comes in to kill the alliance free of guards because they're all running after the ranged one. Cool strat. I guess I'd do the same if I were horde but for now, this shit is annoying.
---
I literally never finished that quest. I don't know how many yetis I killed but I'd fly to arathi to do a few quests near my level and then leave to another zone for a bit then come back. Id always go farm yetis for a bit every time I came back. Probably put a total of 4 hours and several levels grinding yetis to never get anything. Eventually just out leveled the zone dropped the quest and never looked back.
---
Why the hell are there so many undead? They are ugly AF.
---
BGs will put a stop to 60s farming for honor, or lessen it. But this isn’t that. When a 60 kills lowbies in darkshire they’re not getting honor, they’re just griefing for fun. 
---
I also don’t think you should considering anything in classic to go just like it did in vanilla. They really aren’t comparable, and so far nothing has gone just like it did back then. No one got to 60 a few days after launch, and took down rag and onyxia in the first week. No one knew absolutely everything there is to know about the entire world and all of its mechanics available in convenient mods right at launch. Shits pretty different now. 
---
In fact, when you consider how wildly different things are today, I don’t know why you’re not upset about all of that changing the vibe... instead of something that legitimately annoys you and isn’t even allowed.
---
: - )
---
&gt;is this simply due to the fact that fire pots are needed for ragnaros and frost pots currently have no use in the game until naxx comes out? 
---
Yes. Also people stockpile GFPPs for BWL.
---
&gt;or is the materials for greater frost protection pots easier to get? 
---
Also yes. Both reagents are farmable but no one cares about farming elemental water while elemental fire competition is terrible for most of the servers.
---
Redout cloak from DM N Tribute is really good.
---
Fel harded bracers from warlock mount boss in DM W are really good.
---
Naglering from BRD golemlord is good. 
---
If you have gold, flurry axe, amulet of grand marshal morris, stockade pauldrons, skullflame shield are worth it. 
---
You probably need some more SP for threat. If you could do some MC and ONY for judgement pieces those would be helpful. And SP chant on your weapon. Briarwood reed is good. 
---
Otherwise gear looks fine for mitigation. 
---
If you take holy shock over holy shield, your boss threat will be much better. And never forget about exorsisim for strat and scholo
---
Dungeons and AoE farms are where us prot pallies shine. Cheers
---
\&gt; -I make less money and should be compensated for doing my job in a dungeon because of this 
---
You seem entitled. It's not their job to tank the dungeon for you. They can do something else with their time.
---
well THIS is obviously the fake skewed census that doesnt matter. seriously tho is this fake? cause if its real thatd be hilarious
---
I love people with your mentality wait till the honor latter starts getting competitive and you start crying because there’s not enough alliance in the world or queuing for bg’s
---
Sounds like someone’s mad about PvP on a PvP server (okay but in this case it sucks and they shouldn’t be on the roofs doing that, a GM should get them down)
---
I think it’s an entirely different game in terms of the combat.  The best you could do is shaman in terms of bursting potential (spec), and choosing options based on circumstance (protection prayers).
---
Everyone wants to be efficient as possible now. They know whats coming and want to be prepared. In vanilla not that many people were like "GOTTA SPAWN CAMP MOLTEN CORE 8 HOURS FOR RANK 14 ASAP"
---
Somebody who has raided ridiculously intense mythic+ shit this stuff will seem relatively easier.
---
But i think you are missing my point. Yes - Naxx and AQ40 will be cleared week 1. But that does not mean that 99% of people will be able to do this.
---
I mean jesus i had moroms blowing fuckers up on baron geddon this week. The simplest mechanic in the game still fucks people because youre required to bring 40 people.
---
Alot of players are new or havent played in 15 years. Naxx will destroy their soul.. i mean look at the total number of people that actually cleared Naxx before release of BC. These players were badasses at the time and were struggling.
---
Unless your Guild is spamming Scholo and and for done reason your server has more Shamans and your entire cast of Warriors and druid can't support tanking your full Guild to exalted rep.
---
Game play has changed a lot since vanilla. This used to be a fun part of the game. Yes, of course, ask GMs to boot them but we used to take care of it ourselves. It was fun to watch. Someone camping (and you don't have a main to take them out)... Put out in SW/IF chat... Done. If no one on to do it, do something else or ask when it's usually clear or group up. If you still can't deal, transfer to better "faction balance" or nonpvp. If still QQ, gquit.
---
Now, all that said, not sure if it's like it was with this vanilla release, but we used to be able to level in battlegrounds. Didn't have to quest if you didn't want to. Pvp, find rooftops to get on, Pvp, go under SW, Pvp, take out camping horde, Pvp, fish in ogrimar, Pvp, 40 man raid, Pvp, pirate dance party, Pvp, grind pets, Pvp, swim as far as you can, Pvp, take out camping horde, Pvp, grind banana suit, Pvp.... Good ol days
---
I'm logging in now. Don't sweat, I'm armed with the sword of a thousand truths.
---
For healing, is there an Addon where you can just mouse over the target frame, then click the key for a spell on your bar to cast it on that target?
---
I thought Healbot did this... but I tried using it yesterday and it only had left, middle, and right click spells for mouseover setup. 
---
I also know Clique does this as well but you have to assign each specific spell a button, which it then creates a mouseover macro for is how I understand it.
---
So, is there not an Addon that just provides mouseover cast support for spells already set up on your bars? Or is this impossible with the current API and custom macros are basically needed? Any other healing advice would be greatly appreciated!
---
and it sounds like your not that smart. why would i feel ANY loyalty to this guild? just because im in it? lol you aren't gunna be "loyal" to a bunch of communists that run your country are you?
---
This answer should be correct.
---
Good racials and animations, plus Undead Rogue is iconic.
---
That’s what I figured you meant but didn’t want to assume. I’m on Smolderweb Alliance with my 23 paladin. I find groups okish. Hasn’t been an issue for me.
---
It's not enjoyable, but it's better than transferring to a server where WE are the 20% (or less). Blizzard screwed the pooch on this one with the open transfers from the start. If we could transfer to a balanced server, many of us would.  But the balanced servers are closed to transfers on and off (for good reason)
---
Where do you choose the difficulty options in-game?
---
I wanna be hardcore like you.
---
I mean it would make sense to warn. Most of us were kids and it would make zero sense to lay down the ban hammer. A warning would have scared me shitless and I would have never done it again lol!
---
I am ally. I really feel like it's balanced. Sometimes it feels like we just own horde, and sometimes it feels like we are hunted like animals. PM me with your name when you join!
---
Getting to him is legitimately hard.  Kill the medics first and watch the cleave from the soldiers.  The officers get killed last because they always bubble (even through stuns).
---
The stuff I’ve read and seen said that hit is 12-16 and crit is worth less than hit. I know Xn explicitly said on his stream that 1 hit is worth 16sp
---
Get mirahs song mh and dal rend offhand
---
&gt;Are horde players just supposed to stop playing because alliance can't PvP?
---
But nobody said that? Im horde and yes theres not much to do so we pvp.. AGAINST OTHER 60s. 
---
Why the hell would I grief lowbies, preventing them from leveling when we heavily outnumber alliance players already?
---
The hunter could easily ask the gm to reserve the leaf for him. If the gm refuses, then the hunter reither sucks it up or leaves the guild. That simple.
---
Wow that's terrible. How's the price on Cured Rugged Hide?
---
What am I backing them up with? If you run a light, you’ll be given a ticket/fine. If you kill someone, arrested. If you willingly do something illegal they do not warn you. This isn’t saying if you’re not caught you’re okay, obviously if you don’t get caught no one would know. Parking in spots you’re not supposed to is the most basic law you can break around where I live and that’s a $15 ticket. Just like a ban for attacking in a roof. 
---
As for ignorance? If you don’t see a sign but park in a fire lane, don’t expect nothing to happen. There usually aren’t signs near yellow sidewalks where fire hydrants are, but that doesn’t make it okay to park there. 
---
There’s two examples. If this isn’t what you wanted you’re going to need to be more specific friend.
---
Thanks, but I don’t think you fully understand the definition of an exploit
---
Instant pvp que........
---
Warframe's Empyrian and raid logging.
---
I'll kill a man in a fair fight or if I think he's going to start a fair fight..... Or if he bothers me or if there is a woman or if I'm getting paid, mostly if I'm getting paid but corpse camping 20vs1, when does that get fun?
---
The problem is not ganking its griefing and yes it did used to happen in vanilla but it was significantly rarer you might have it happen to you or twice a month usually if you visited high risk locations like strangle gank, southshore or tanaris or never in a life time not every single time you log in.
---
I farmed Demonic Runes in Azshara. Took me like 4 hours sharing the spot with another Ally, no gank squads rolling around just random 2v2 and 3v3s. This was on Faerlina on a Friday night a week ago
---
The problem is the undead pvp racial.  They should seriously cap UD at 750 players per server and throw the rest of the training wheel gang into queue.
---
I had this problem and I can only run wow in windowed mode...
---
Bring 2 mages for sheep a rogue and your pally/priest. Rogue can interrupt the healers or you can sheep them or aoe them all down. If i remember you can dispel the npc fort buff.
---
I mainly go for the racials. For instance I knew from private servers that wisp form would be bis on ally so I went nelf rogue
---
Thanks for saying it's hard - it's the first time the healer and I had genuinely hit a wall before, we were kind of stunned and thought we were just doing something wrong. Cheers!
---
Where is the funny? This is just a shit post covering up our sub
---
because leader is too lazy to populate it with other classes/ another hunter is more important then getting our hunter the one piece hes been needing for months
---
&gt;If anything we should be the ones upset but we’d honestly forgotten about them.
---
Definitely seems like you're pretty upset.
---
People also forget about how few servers they had at launch. Blizzard really screwed the pooch on this one.
---
Is there a way or addon to display shadow reflector buff when an enemy use it?
---
You seem entitled. It's not like the other 4 players have to run the dungeon with you, they could be doing something else with their time.
---
Notice how all 5 of the party are player classes filling a role, but you feel that statement applies to exactly 1 of them.
---
It's happening more with Alliance on my server than Horde. I logged in at Light's Hope yesterday and was immediately killed by a group of 20+ alliance. So I go to fly to UC, but guess what, they've killed the flightmaster. So I wait for him to respawn, but they immediately kill him again. I'm a Warrior, so I can't stealth away, and every time I res they use the Spy Addon to find me and kill me before I can Hearth. When I said something in World Chat I was told "stop crying" "stop being a baby" and "why don't you just kill them".
---
Literally unplayable Blizzard.
---
Yeah what’s happening right now isn’t how vanilla was. Right now people are trying to max to rank 14, so they’re finding the most efficient ways possible to farm as much honor as possible.
---
I was in the exact same boat 5 weeks ago. I tanked a lot in vanilla but could not remember a damn dungeon.
---
I started tanking BRD, then LBRS then DME as arms. I then switched to the fury raid spec because I got into MC as a dps with shit gear. I was straight up honest with it: "guys I know jack shit about this dungeon". Nobody cares because they would rather have a tank who pulls a useless pack than no tank or a bad one.
---
The first time I had to tank UBRS was scary, I had no idea what to pull or not and my gear was total shit but we made it with 0 wipes. You do it once and then you are set forever
---
No its not because the population between factions in vanilla were more balanced, how hard is that to understand?
---
Lol. 
---
"People are playing the game in a way I don't like. It's hurting my anus please ban them."
---
It's people like this that make games lame.

I’ve raided mythic and I’ve pushed very high m+ keys.

Sunwell was the most soul crushing raid I ever did. Trash was a nightmare. Way worse than Naxx 40.

I believe its because there's a higher player cap per server. It used to be 3k, so a 60-40 split was 1200 to 1800. Now its 12k, making it 4800 to 7200. There's nearly an *entire vanilla server population* advantage to the horde.

You forgot the other 50 mage spots.

I like Horde, not for racials , not for anything related to min/ max I hate their imbalance at time, I just love the horde characters, towns and vileness... alliance feels so fluffy to me. I feel like their mounts should be unicorns, not horses... gnomes are the worst... dwarfs though, your cool
---
For point of reference I'm an Orc using an axe and how I manage 6% hit on Rag with FR is 
---
Ony Tooth Pendant 1% hit
---
Satyrs Bow 1% hit
---
Black Dragonscale Boots+Chest 1% hit (set bonus)
---
Voone's Vice Grips 2% hit
---
Brigam Girdle 1% hit
---
I then wear HoJ and Black Hand's Breadth for trinkets (though Rune of the Guard Captain is also pretty good here if you need the hit)
---
I still have 241 FR unbuffed while maintaining 6% hit and two threat trinkets.
---
T1 helm+ enchant 30fr
---
Ony neck 10 fr
---
Fireguard Shoulders+enchant 27 fr
---
Black Dragonscale Chest 12 fr
---
Dark Iron Leggings+enchant 50 fr
---
Black Dragonscale Boots 24fr
---
Dark Iron Bracers 18fr
---
Peridot Circle 20fr
---
Oceans Breeze 15fr
---
Fireproof Cloak 25fr
---
Skullflame Shield 10fr
---
If I really wanted to go crazy on threat I could put 20 fr on my LHH, but that's way Overkill on current content. If I had Accuria I would wear that instead of Peridot Circle and use t1 gloves and belt. 6 fr loss but gain a bunch of strength, agi, stam and armor plus 3 piece t1 bonus which makes shield slam hit a bit harder.
---
Pure aesthetics, I hate horde races. They look like hot garbage. They look hideous in gear and appearance.

LOL that is how the game has worked for 15 years you noobs.

sometimes I forget kids think WoW classic is a new game.

skip school and login in the morning if you want to play with the adults.

Now show us the top of the page that shows how many actual people/reports that census includes

So the best way for warriors to farm gold is to not be a warrior.

lmao a hunter needing dalrends, what an utter mong.

i bet he had hoj as well in p1

"just you wait, you're gonna have long BG queue times &gt;:(" every time
---
again why didnt you just roll pve if you only care about organized and balanced fights? you knew damn well world pvp means getting jumped while leveling, camped if your faction is losing a fight, the whole shebang. literally all you had to do was just not play pvp if you cant handle the consequences of it
---
i feel like horde players are the laid back stoner types while alliance are the preppy obnoxious shitheads

They \*want\* to run the dungeon, plenty of tanks out there who don't need the dungeon anymore because due to tank demand they ran it ten times in October and already have everything they need. 
---
This is the reality you and many others fail to accept. As a prot warrior myself, half the groups I run with I don't expect to press that need roll on a single rare drop in the entire run. We just gear out so much faster. So if you try to convince me it's my \*job\*, then I quit and you can LFM.

Bet you're the kind of dude who goes "pVp hApPeNeD On a pVp sErVeR"

Oh I didn’t graduate yet. Working on my doctors. Again I agreed with you, I don’t see why you’re still trying to write when we’re on the same side, professor.

Thanks for great advice! I raid as healer, have t2 pants and t1 shoulders and are planning on getting more of that. Skullflame and flurry axe is what I'm saving for, but currently I'm 400 g short of a skullflame shield:)

Many people do not care about your definitions of "honorable kill" and "griefing". Their definition is "I kill the other faction".  That is why they posted that BGs may alleviate.
---
That text is so annoying, idk why its a thing now.
---
Is there anything good about Blizzard?
---
A lower level alliance waved at me at the docks at ratchet. I wanted to wave back, but missclicked and aggroed the guards that killed me. I also missed the boat. Intended or not, that was a fine way to kill someone. (Yes, im quite new to this game).
---
Well good luck.
---
dude thats exact same for alliance, except to do ANY cross continent travel, you get flagged.
---
You can do org to uc with 0 pvp flagging. Alliance cannot do that.
---
I thought that warlock soul shards disappeared on log out like conjured water. I'd seen too many warlocks show up to instances and not be able to summon because they don't have shards.
---
I roll my own warlock and learn they persist through logout, and now I am judging the shit out of every warlock who has ever said they have no shards. What the fuck is your excuse?
---
Reported them? Cry baby.
---
Every item can then be rolled on as need by every character following this logic. If you can vendor it for gold, you need it.
---
Yeah. I mean I knew what I signed up for when my guild and I didn't switch servers, but Stalaag is an absolute mess for Alliance to do anything outside of a 2+grouo adventure or a really long corpse run.
---
Horde are in all of our cities (except darnassus? I think? Idk no one goes there) , they run the tram, they run the boats in BB/Menethil. Constantly 2+groups of horde camping the docks in Menethil. I've seen groups of horde camping quest locations in zones 40+. It's rediculous.
---
While your statement is true, it is also reasonable to be upset that it requires amassing a small army of reporters in order to be able to simply play the game.
---
Please don't be sexist. Sex or gender doesn't have anything to do with this.

Lol. I guess that’s the one bright side. All the items I craft to sell on the AH has increased in price from 50-100%. Lul
---
Run dungeons
---
because he alrady has like all of it i think (maybe like 2 pieces of t1 he needs)
---
Very true. I will mercilessly camp the shit out of any horde I see until the SOB gets away or calls in his own squad of backup
---
Warrior lol. There’s an add on that circles the ability to use next on retail so wondering if there was one for classic
---
A mature and level-headed response.
---
Just play on a pve server.
---
Except dwarves, alli races are just lame in my eyes.
---
Blizzard being blizzard. Nobody does it better than them.
---
yes except he doesnt need the first items you mentioned anymore...
---
Imagine being so upset you made this post
---
Well he has a spot in my guild, and tbh it sounds like a lot more fun that yours.
---
I don't understand. This is part of the experience you paid for. We had to go do something else on a different character back then. Or just log out. They get bored eventually, but some servers are basically just never going to be safe for one faction.
---
I had a nightmare scholo run where a fury dps warrior would charge in split seconds after the tank starts the pull. As a result he died on every boss for the entire instance and seemingly couldn't understand why. Wasted us 15 minutes due to having to wait for him to run to chillwind for repair. He also took the recipe for flask of supreme power because he claimed to be an alchemist, yet didn't learn it in front of us because "he doesn't have 300 Alchemy". He even ninja'd a skin of shadow without understanding what it was even for, before I could even finish typing /roll.
---
One of my favorite things on the internet are dudes who think vanilla is hardcore.
---
You lose no items or gold when you die, you dont even take durability damage when other players kill you. Most graveyard runs are 20 to 30 seconds. 
---
Theyre holding your hand so very tightly already.
---
previous. it may disappoint you, but im not interessted in the conversation you try to lead me into. go look for friends somewhere else please.
---
If I still want to play when classic bc releases, I may reroll alliance just to do something about imbalance, since it will be well over 90% horde.
---
Lets all have a moment of silence for the crewmembers of the Maiden's Virtue... Nobody told them when they signed up they'd be fighting mobs of horde decked out in T1 gear.
---
I’ve bought tanks for 10-25g.  After looking for tanks for 30 mins, everyone chips in 5g and we’re off.  I’m actually shocked how well offering just 10g works for level 60 dungeons.
---
Okay, so you misread the conversation and tried your hardest to fight your point, but you have still yet to back up your two statements. In what world are they true??
---
Those statements are absolute, so in your eyes cops NEVER EVER give warnings, and not knowing a law is no excuse for breaking it.
---
Doesnt matter the context of the over all argument, i want to know why you think the world is so black and white that EVERY LITTLE LAW is never forgiven and not knowing about it isnt an excuse (even thought there are tens and tens of thousands of stupid laws)
---
Okay Karen
---
I love it myself too. But I'm not sure if I agree on it being rushed. 
---
I would like to believe that the game is being monitored in all kinds of ways. And with that I would like to believe that it just seems like it's being rushed but in reality the content is being released in a manner which people wants/needs more to do in relative to how everything works today, meaning how people like being fed content and such.
---
Personally. I've got the Lionheart helm recipe on my warrior, i've not no need to farm gold. I'm a tank, I fury tank. I've got no 2h weapon &amp; not gonna waste gold on some blue crap in order to play MS in PVP. While pvping as fury/prot is boring AF. 
---
I've just made a twink and sunk like 800g on him, fully decked out rogue @ 19. Other than this, right now, I'm just running Redridge ganking until WSG comes.
---
It's making me curious on Shadowlands. I'm HOPING shadowlands is gonna be good.. if its not, that'll be the end of wow imo.
---
That Enhancement Shaman was amazing DPS and I would one day have a Sulfurus and be number one damage... darn you, Unbreakable.
---
In the 15 years I have played, across 3+ servers, PvE and PvP, horde has never been able conduct themselves as anything but childish twits.  I know there are alliance that do as well but I have 0 faith in anyone that plays horde.
---
&gt;all the imba PVP racials*
---
Seriously how can people claim to have not seen this coming when you've got one side with a free PVP trinket and AoE stun and AS buffs while the other side has faster corpserunning. LMAO.
---
Is BWL confirmed for January?
---
No changes remember. Also a 15 year old game and had no official support for 13 years. BC fixed a lot of classics problem, classic is basically 95% of what vanilla was actually like with that 5% being mostly mechanical changes and not game play. They also announced in a blue post that they're working on the honour bug and it should be fixed tomorrow.
---
According to /r/classicwow I only want to play horde because it gives me a slight advantage in PvP situations. Apparently it has nothing to do with wanting to play a large cow man (my main from vanilla-wotlk was tauren hunter) as opposed to a fucking gnome. Played drenaei pally in TBC named "tentacles" tho, that was pretty fun.
---
Apparently a lot of people are attracted to playing a race (human) that enslaved/tortured another race (orc) in a concentration camp... But understandable, a lot of ppl on this subreddit are from US where they voted for a guy who is now throwing migrant children into concentration camps.
---
Man it's frustrating that people who wanted a relatively pure recreation are getting blamed for this. 
---
Here's a reminder that layered megaservers are a massive change that blew the entire notion of recreating Vanilla PvP servers up. We spent the last part of May, June, July, and August trying to garner enough of an outcry that Blizzard would reconsider layering. I think we're the last people who deserve blame for this. 
---
As for your question: game's fucked anyway and sliding quickly toward 90/10 ratios on most PvP servers. It only aesthetically resembles Vanilla on said servers so change it however it needs to be changed. Horde having better guards and protected intercontinental transport was, I think, a result of them being outnumbered in Vanilla. Opportunities to either buff Alliance guards in the transport hubs or even open up some Alliance Zeppelins. 
---
The thing that would help the most would be **overflow PvP servers**. Herod 1 and Herod 1a, for example. Herod 1 has faction based queues and a perfect 50/50 ratio at all times. Overflow goes to Herod 1a, exclusively populated by the overbalanced faction where they can play while they wait in queue for the main server. Herb/Node/Devilsaurs spawn at 1/2 rate on Herod 1a. World bosses do not spawn on Herod 1a. Herod 1 and Herod 1a allow cross-server (layer) grouping so that players may do instances together.
---
Free faction transfers are offered to the majority faction on these split servers. A gentle incentive for players to solve this issue.
---
Blizzard has a long history of favoring Horde.
---
Oh ok. Let us just log off so you can enjoy your personal leveling zones.
---
PvP happened on a PvP server? I'm shocked.
---
If only tanks who still needed gear were to run dungeons, you'd be waiting hours for a tank to come along. You rely hard on tanks who are already geared to run dungeons for gold.  It is you who is greedy here by wanting both the gold and your loot from the dungeon.
---
PVP server totally agree...
---
Its going to be a warzone to be sure. 
---
PVE, neah. It pops up quick now. We had folks who failed to make the jump off the ledge and had to kill the elites, they were all back very quick.  
---
Option 2 is to use the door at UBRS and walk in 🤣
---
I used to believe world pvp was fun
---
Kalimdor is awesome and EK...meh
---
You think they suck, yet they don't need that instance.  They get nothing for running it except a chance at items noone else needs.  They don't get gear upgrades, they aren't guaranteed anything from the dungeon so why should THEY run it.  Tanks are rare and once they gear up, which they gear the quickest of any class since they are such high demand then they don't need to run the dungeon anymore.  So they are helping you out and in turn the group helps them out, idk why you can't see that.
---
You could still run into their AoE spells and die without attacking them. So that suggestion wouldn't work either.
---
If you have ever played on a p server you know bg gy camping is a real thing.
---
So would you like your body to be teleported to the nearest graveyard(mind you in classic the graveyards are few and far between) or left in the ocean when you hit the load screen?
---
From a lore perspective? The alliance are imperialist slavers and are clearly the bad guys.
---
From a gameplay perspective? I just enjoy the horde architecture and designs more.
---
From a player base perspective? Horde seems older, more laid back, and far less obnoxious.
---
lol what
---
Me and a couple of friends actively moved to Outland EU and played Horde for a good while in MoP knowing it was a 99% Alliance server. It was great fun.
---
Allies do have tiger mount which is pretty cool
---
But not as cool as skelly horse
---
So the fact that no one is posting alliance census data now compared to last week means there aren't less alliance playing?
---
It's not a misleading post at all, but it's not entierly correct either.
---
If you dont make it worth my while to run a dungeon, Ill just keep leveling my alt and you dont run the dungeon for 30m-1hr. If I dont make it worth your while, Ill find someone in a matter of minutes. Most people want to play Blaster McBignumbers (and make it frustrating to tank, but thats another issue), if I dont and choose to play a more rare role, of course its going to come with me having more weight as far as groups go.
---
I COULD be okay with Tauren or Trolls. Maybe even Orcs. But the Forsaken are utterly unnatural. I find them tough to cooperate with.
---
Def not the case for phase 2 warlock
---
I would sometimes play even 14 hours a day. Now I play maybe 1 or 2 the past week.
---
The internet is no longer just for porn!
---
Oh, and Gnomes are gross.
---
Go hang out and farm in the zone where the instance is located. More often than not you’ll find a group LFM a couple times an hour. I’ve always had good luck doing it that way.
---
Other classes can make more gold just doing that other shit.  Why run around farming thorium with wpvp risk and inconsistent returns when you can reliably spam ZF or DM:T and just buy your thorium needs on the AH?
---
Also, get a healer and do DM:E jump runs if you want a safe spot to hide out and get your farm on.
---
Or just quit playing Warrior, maybe it's not the class for you.
---
Do you think Paul Stanley expected his song to become a meme when he was writing his solo album? 
---
I like to imagine there's a wheel that's spun when a member of an older band drops solo work. There's a formula that factors in things like how long it has been since your original band was popular and how big a name you were within said band, and this formula determines how large the wheel is and the quality of the options. 
---
"Alright Paul, 'Live To Win' drops soon and it's time to see how it'll get marketed. Spin that wheel!"
---
"C'mon 'Big Redemption Scene In A Forgettable Action Movie'! C'mon!"
---
"Aww, we're sorry Paul. Looks like you got 'Over-The-Top Anthem For Kids Putting Extreme Efforts Into A Video Game'.
---
"Can I spin again?"
---
"Maybe if you were Gene."
---
&gt;tanks offering tanking services is that the tanks don't need anything from those dungeons
---
I dont know why people mention this anymore as if tanks have a monopoly on not needing gear. It's just more ***COPE***
---
Why move the body. The body is on the boat. Leave it on the boat. You can get to it when the boat comes back around, and even stay on the boat as a ghost and rez on the other side.
---
Are tanks actually profiting from this?  How much do tanks typically charge?
---
No you wouldn't. 
---
LFM = looking for more
---
LFG = looking for group
---
One means you want to invite, the other means you want to join an established group and be invited.
---
10/10 shitpost on boat to kilmador right now
---
It's the same mindset people have in China when it comes to resources. Better to make a little now than more over a longer  time.
---
They don't really have foresight, it's just about getting instant gratification.
---
My biggest regret was playing on a PVP server with what eventually became my main. Every expansion it was the same issue, with 9:1 horde to alliance on my server. You had to wait for them all to be raiding so you could level. 
---
Major fun killer.
---
Just don't do it. Level PVE.
---
lmao retail is shit
---
this has nothing to do w/ retail u didnt even read it
---
You're so cool.
---
It's not a job, you're going to instances to get gear, he's going to get...what?
---
I tanked many times for guys in exchange for gold or orb cuz I don't need anything from an instance and they do, and yet they can't find a tank for like 45 mins. It's fair, I get mine you get yours.
---
On my server (mograine) there's a decked out guild near 24/7 on that boat, always the same assholes.
---
No, they fucked up by allowed insane faction imbalances despite the server populations being 2-4 times their original size.
---
I'd rather let the devs do their work unshackled from the "No changes" and have us vote on directions.  Like a) more guards or b) longer aggro range. 
---
We aren't in vanilla.  We never were and we never could go back fully.  People have to accept it and not be demanding bugs and shitty game play for nostalgia.  We want a good game.  That's it.  Vanilla is not a perfect game.  Stop pretending it was.
---
We’ve been downing Ony since the first week of October and we have one Vis’Kag in guild already. I was saying that somewhat cheekily but I half expect to get it before Dal Rends. My server is a Horde clusterfuck and we’re Alliance, just getting into UBRS is a painful process so almost all PuGs of it have stopped. We do guild runs but not in a fashion that lends itself to grinding a low drop item.
---
I’ve just been sort of prioritizing HoJ because I can do three man runs for it without competition, so it’s a lock if it drops. I’m already well geared (both T2 pieces, mostly pre-BiS and T1 except my last trinket), if I can’t get it within a couple more weeks I’ll attempt the solo farm discussed above.
---
Yeah it's not really the same...it's somehow really broken
---
Im edgy
---
Qq more alliance scum
---
Activision Blizzard is not capable of making changes within the classic philosophy because the company's culture is incompatible with the classic phiolosophy.
---
So #nochanges.

I'd rather have the modern playerbase exploit the original game than have Bobby Kotick take any creative freedoms.
---
&gt; HE ALREQADY HAS THE SINEW lol get off your high horse you pathetic loser.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; pathetic loser.   
---
&gt; pathetic loser. 
---
EVEN WORSE! It's a safe 50% drop chance. Either that or the Eye drops. Literally outplayed yourself!
---
&gt;so only guild leader gets to have slaves gearing him out because "its hard to manage a pug" and you are calling me a whiner?  
---
WHY DONT YOU MAKE YOUR OWN GUILD THEN YOU MORON? IF IT'S THIS EASY AND MANAGING GUILD IS THIS EASY WHY ISN'T EVERY1 BEING A GM SO THEY HAVE ACTUALLY ACCESSS TO FREE RESERVED LOOT? do you even think when you write?
---
INB4: "HURRDURR I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME ELSE I WOULD BE THE BEST GM IN THE GAME WE WOULD HAVE MOST WORLD FIRSTS AND WOULD BE ALREADY CLEARING MC SUB 20 MINUTES"
---
Fking literally delusional
---
Someone killed your door? :O
---
you okay my man?
---
i guess we just are not good then aha. we do a full MC clear in about 2.5-just under 3 hours with a full 40 man group 5-8 of them being pugs
---
Can i die at Thorium point. Corpse run all the way to UBRS. and ressurect inside?
---
Remove rewards and it will go away. People aren't doing it because they are dicks, they are doing it because it progresses their char.
---
&gt;Then what are you doing, right now?

Getting a chuckle out of your screeching and crying

Classic (game, movie, meme)
---
Ooooooooor and this maybe too edgy for you, but try playing on a pve server if you don’t like getting ganked all day.
---
&gt;And I guess a good part of adult men that does not care about looks of their toons and if the surroundings looks nice or not will play horde also feel alliance is filled with younger ppl and women gamers. And they are ofc not wrong. Save for the emo’s playing undead ofc. In addition, these same oldish guys would probably be drawn more to pure muscle and general primitive power sort of. And horde has that theme for sure.
---
The most boomer reply I've ever seen lol
---
Certain mobs dropped BoEs that were actually just random world drops. 17yr old me was convinced trolls dropped agility items because one time i got a lucky randon boe that had agility.
---
You wanted the authentic vanilla experience.
---
This is awesome
---
I disagree with your subjective, anecdotes. Anything logical to say? "Hero derp getting outnumbered 3 to two isn't a big deal. Just because on average the 3 will almost always beet the two doesn't mean the two cant win! What if the 3 are drinking drain-o and eating tide pods! Then the two win every time!"
---
That crappy mischaracterization is as reasonable as "the two can win with better brains 100%!"
---
The orignal post and op's answers are hilarious, I just had to.
---
Ok Pvpgod
---
I sort of manually did with clique. Just assign the keys on your action bars as the keys for clique. It is pretty fast.
---
I feel your pain. My friends and I went afk in Ironforge the other day and came back to corpses. We were at the bank/AH area.
---
BFA is calling you home.
---
I think they should just let it happen and people should fight instead of complaining to gms. Don't play on a pvp server if you don't like it.
---
What is the thresold you should on a key that spam while pressed (for not losing time between cast) ?  
---
I'm bored of spam the key for Bolt on my shaman while fighting, but if I put a very low thresold i can't write in the chat obviously (qqqqq..)  
---
So what is the maximum thresold you can put while not loosing time between cast ? (100ms )    
---
Thanks for your advices.
---
which is great, because the more whorde that think they can take DKs, the better since this is a secret ally strategy.  Whorde may win in conquest, but Ally will win by culture victory lol.

If you look at the "alliance are quitting" post from yesterday there are a lot of comments saying "why would anyone play horde if not for PvP racial"
---
Wait untill someone undercuts some of your products, then undercut them by 1 copper.
---
*with an alt
---
People do have the capacity to be decent. The majority of toxic comments have only largely manifested since Phase 2.
---
Oh man left stalagg a while ago. So worth.
---
Your lack of dedication is concerning. I prescribe 1 neck beard and 2 boxes of hot pockets.
---
You would think alliance being imperialist slavers would be a negative but a lot of people who play this game are from US, so...
---
When I started playing I was a hunter. I thought my pet would drown in deep water so every time I had to cross a body of water I'd dismiss my pet.
---
I have a little of both, been primarily playing my PVE Human Warrior as of late, when I get the chance to play for quick instance grouping. Good try at guessing one out of two possible factions go, yay you!
---
I literally only play Horde for the male undead casting animations. I'd happily go ally if i could have those without a tos violating mod like tmorph.
---
Lol
---
It is humans man. Doesn't matter if they roll horde or alli
---
youre right 
---
ppl are just stupid
---
dont argue w/ stupid ppl
---
I am leveling a hunter now because my guild desperately needs them. So I can confirm at least for our guild.
---
LOL did you just call a pvp server in classic “war mode” hahahahahahahahhahahaha
---
And you apparently haven’t experienced any adventure in your race to 60.  You need to realize that there is not “one way” to play this game.
---
This was the solution! Removed the line: SET gxAdapter "NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080" and everything started up nicely!
---
Because people were nostalgic for a better time when PvP wasn't this stupid. They expected crazy 1v1s in Ungoro or 40v40s in Hillsbrad, not 10v1 on the way to BRM. They simply didn't know better and now they're 60 and the game is functionally unplayable as it's meant to be and their only options are to start all over (months wasted) or just quit. 
---
It's like remembering how fun Disney land was when you were a kid and coming back as an adult only to find 10 dudes standing in front of every ride ready to beat your ass and take your wallet. 
---
Those of us who played pservers, K3 specifically, knew this was coming and hope Blizz would do something about it.
---
Man, just transfer to a more balanced server
---
I mean - that’s ok that you don’t think so but you’re not right on that, I wouldn’t have based my comment off of nothing. Look at the second comment in the thread - guild leader wants his guys to have their mains have complete pre raid bis and pots before they even touch their alt. That’s what I’m talking about and the kind of behavior many others are as well.  
---
Also - as a tank you obviously have different requirements than dps/heals, you should know this.
---
That the drake colors in BWL could determine the types of breath chromaggus had.
---
Welcome to mount specific riding skills
---
So you have full gear and just go run dungeons for nothing at all, no gear upgrades, no helping friends, no reserving anything?  You just run a dungeon with ransoms for no reason at all all the time?  Nice!
---
&gt;Man it's frustrating that people who wanted a relatively pure recreation are getting blamed for this.
---
Because it was not realistic, it was never going to happen when people already know all the content and have been grinding it for the last 4-6 years. 
---
Its also the norm on retail to min-max, so there was no way that part wouldn't be a crossover.
---
&gt;Here's a reminder that layered megaservers are a massive change that blew the entire notion of recreating Vanilla PvP servers up. We spent the last part of May, June, July, and August trying to garner enough of an outcry that Blizzard would reconsider layering. I think we're the last people who deserve blame for this.
---
Well, I think megaservers are superior, and I give Blizz props for that change. Vanilla is better with a much higher population imo, as it removes a lot of the "organic time-gating" that is inherent on low pop servers, where its hard for you to progress on certain content like elite quests or low lvl dungeons because there aren't enough people online.
---
For layering, I agree 100%. I was okay with it for 2 weeks, but after it should have been removed. I would also personally have like to have honor while lvling because I just find lvling  much more fun that way, and its the private server norm as well.
---
&gt;The thing that would help the most would be overflow PvP servers. Herod 1 and Herod 1a, for example. Herod 1 has faction based queues and a perfect 50/50 ratio at all times.
---
Well, it sounds like a better solution than straight up faction queue (that system is a disaster, its been tried on TBC private servers).
---
But I would rather just see them set up new servers without any type of phasing/layering bullshit and just have a system on the server baseline that does not allow you to create a character on the faction that is overpopulated and that would always maintain equilibrium.  It would have to messure activity obviously, but less strict than straight up faction queue.
---
&gt;Free faction transfers are offered to the majority faction on these split servers.
---
I agree with that, but then they also need to cancel the plans for cross-realm battlegrounds otherwise there is literally incentive to switch to the faction that is worse off on their server. Shamans also couldn't switch so it would be a logistical nightmare I guess.
---
“He’s delusional” cannot be a quote from anything because billions of people say it independently of whoever your decided quote source may be. It’s almost like saying “ok” is a quote from GoodBurger.
---
How bout tanking some dungeons? Warrior leveling was awful even before phase 2 but you’ll always be in high demand for instances
---
what fishing add on
---
because you cant watch tv and fish by default
---
It's crazy that they have so many subs providing so much income yet most gm ticket responses are copy pasted (some even TOO LAZY TO CHANGE THE NAME OF THE RECIPIENT), bugs haven't been fixed, griefing from illegal safe spots not reprimanded, NO KEYCHAIN, etc..
---
What exactly are we paying for? Why play blizzard servers when they provide almost less support than private servers do?
---
Why not just say Group Loot Rules?
---
Locks can’t AoE shit solo, that’s mages
---
I think this is satire, yet every person in this thread is taking it super seriously. Thought it was funny lol
---
Watch the video again. The bear was in front of him, the surger moved towards the raid, the bear ran behind him resulting in his death. He was behind the tank, then the tank moved behind him.
---
Actually he does sound like a ton of fun to do dungeons with, it sounds like his runs would go a lot smoother than the average pug-run.
---
Normal vs PvP servers are like the difference between Reddit and 4chan. Tons of people thought it would be cool to “post on 4chan,” got trolled, got called racial slurs, and now are complaining that 4chan isn’t more like Reddit.
---
It’s a story as old as time, just like Beauty and the Beast.
---
I canceled my auto renewal and put this as the reason. Not coming back unless I can move to PvE.
---
Based on world pvp on biased servers staying sports hunting, expect no life pushing. So no, ranking will soft cap at the rank below the top% earning.
---
FOR THE HORDE!! THE SALTY ALLIANCE TEARS FUEL US!!!
---
It’s weird right? Most guildies are just randoms too that happened to join the same guild. There’s nothing inherently less random about it. But it is more fun, it’s like you try harder if you’re accountable to your guild.
---
Sounds like someone hasnt been griefed by a 3:1 pop for months. Lol.
---
There's literally no recourse on servers like Herod and Stalagg, your best bet is to just int. If you fight back you'll just get camped by MORE people. I switched servers long ago, because I feel there's a difference between griefing and PvP. One day you might learn that.
---
All the horde races look stupid excluding female orcs and trolls.
---
Undead are forced to wear shorts or dresses at all times because of the exposed bone placement which makes armor look dumb.
---
Trolls would be cool if they actually stood up, but they're permanently hunched over, cant wear boots and have the stupid ankle cuffs.
---
Orcs backs are fucking broken. Do you like seeing your guild tabard? Well fuck you then, you dont get to if you roll Male orc.
---
Tauren are actually cool as hell but shields look stupid small on them, same problem Male draenei and worgen have, they need to scale shield sizes better on the bigger races.
---
Ally cities are so much better. I faction swapped for a year to raid with a guild and not being able to go to Ironforge caused me physical pain. Org and undercity are god damn clusterfucks that somehow got worse after cata. Thunder bluff sucks too.
---
To be fair though I would take anything over Darnassus. 
---
Darkshire is my favorite town and I love the quests there, though silverpine and Tirisfall glades have the same aesthetic AND SFK so I probably wouldnt miss it too much, but overall ally is just cooler, stormwind is so awesome and every corner is filled with history or related to a quest
---
Ally lore is cooler, paladins, arthas, the scourge, illidan, king varian, bolvar fordragon... horde is kinda boring with the exception of thrall
---
&gt;you're going to instances to get gear
---
Am I? Basically what you're saying is the only reason anyone except a tank runs an instance is for gear.
---
But tanks? Even if tanks don't need gear they will run instances because.......???? Whatever reason you insert there better only apply to tanks otherwise I really don't understand what you're getting at.
---
Or just reroll horde and take that sweet PVE flight from Org to UC right? 
---
Im guessing you flag yourself on zeps though just to be hardcore. Right?
---
Or he can offer tank services.
---
My guild has killed Raggy 6 times and got 6 leaves, so as a priest I feel your pain.
---
Yeah. Guild and long time friends all voted to stay. This 80-20 horde to alliance split has me completely logged off outside of raid nights. It's quite rediculous.
---
I (priest/healer) still am mad, a lock needed on a +20 spirit chest the other day because he said all healers were mad he kept life tapping. Warlocks don’t need spirit!
---
Do what's best for you man, Blizz doesn't seem to be in a hurry to address the issue so dont depend on them to better your experience.
---
no it should definitely be cross realm but prioritize your own server
---
I would try updating all your addons to their latest revisions-if the problem persists you can try enabling select addons at a time to eliminate the culprits.
---
Tanks have no way to grind gold
---
This is just like when alliance stand on top of the arena in Gadgetzan.
---
I'm confused, why is this sticky?
---
Kinda funny that they'd lay off support staff then, huh?
---
Go full prot or 2h arms, personally think 2h arms is better but thats up to you. Charge&gt;SS&gt;whirlwind and no one will be able to take aggro away from you. Use demo shout and thunderclap for mitigation. Use whirlwind on CD and cleave if you have extra rage.
---
Its not just PVE servers. 90% of the tears here are generated from over populated mega servers. The rest of us on normal PvP servers are doing fine.
---
Ok Boomer
---
Yeah thats gross, im sorry.
---
They could have listened to customer feedback and opened more servers. Instead they tried to cheap out on this "side project" by only allocating a few servers. They could have easily had everything set up ready for launch and had original population caps like in Vanilla.
---
They've been doing expansions for years, they have no excuse.
---
Because it's a catch-22. Leave your server behind and you're potentially leaving behind your guild, friends or family. Often all three. And after you transfer to the new realm, now you're the one on the receiving end.
---
There are no winners in all of this. Including Blizzard. They'd only succeed in drawing the ire of the community no matter what solution they were to go for. But that also doesn't disguise the fact that this whole situation is caused and perpetuated by them, too.
---
All we can hope for is that once this is all over the damage done to Classic isn't beyond repair.
---
Yeah I had a guild opt to stay, I left, life's better for it. I'd recommend reevaluating your choice. It was just unplayable.
---
Early in stratholme for example it's faster to just aoe and have the tank manage resists if you have the comp for it. Imp blizz helps a lot but ofc many mages don't have it at that point
---
To be fair the comments above are also quotes from Chernobyl, even though the first one isn't a 100% correct, he says "Not great, not terrible".
---
Healbot isn't what provides mouseover targeting, that's a macro that does that, and it works in conjunction with healbot or other raid frames. You'll have to make mouseover macros with all the heals you use.
---
The #nochanges people are dumb as a fucking rock.
---
There’s already been changes. Now let’s focus on making classic the best it can be.
---
Im telling you this is not the experience most people had in vanilla. You can make up stats all you want. :) Have a nice day!
---
+1 for Blaster McBignubers
---
I tanked dungeons as arms up to like level 57 and I found myself to be pissed off 90% of the time because I couldn’t hold aggro.  This was less to do with what I was doing and more to do with PUG DPS not being appropriate with their threat; nonetheless, it made tanking dungeons a big headache.  I finally said screw it and went with the deep prot spec recommended by Skarm and I have had so much more fun tanking.  I generate so much more threat and absolutely LIVE by improved taunt.  Did it completely screw up my questing and PVP life?  Yes.  But I love tanking and I love getting instant groups.  Now if I could find a raid spot... :(
---
Sexist?
---
Why the attitude? If you don't like tanks selling services just ignore them, if it doesn't work and everyone feels the same as you do then they'll quickly learn to stop just from the non-responses.
---
Lmao welcome to classic bitch hahaha
---
Prat addon for classic.
---
Because people need to read it.
---
&gt; raise because someone else got a raise. Not my problem. Personally I would never pay for any class to do their job unless they were over leveled
---
have fun never finding a tank, lmao
---
youre analogy is wrong
---
tanks dont need these dungeons... .they dont want or need to do them. But you need or want a tank. The solution is you buy the tank. 
---
Your service is less valuable. There are a million DPS to replace you. 
---
A better analogy is youre asking for the less useful employee to get a raise while asking that the good employee work for less than he is worth while that good employee has an open offer from another employer paying more, and you get mad that he leaves
---
Herod? Alliance have had BRM on lock for a week straight, they seem to be camping Dire Maul half the time and there's plenty of groups around the popular farm spots like Felwood.
---
I'm not buying this pity party and neither should anyone who actually tries to get shit done on Herod.
---
I'm pretty sure this is completely allowed. This is similar to how warlocks solo farm it.
---
Good job shammy
---
That would require more resources than just banning people for it.
---
But if its cross-realm, why the fuck would anyone from a 80/20 "PvP" server switch to the shittier faction on that server? There is absolutely no reason for them to do so, they would just be worse off.
---
But if they weren't able to do BGs, or at least have to wait forever for queue then that would at least be an extra kick in the ass to send some more people over.
---
And again, it was the standard in almost all of vanilla, besides the last 4-6 months out of 3 years (on NA). People knew the people they were fighting in the BGs, with cross-realm they don't.
---
You dont need tac mastery. A simple macro does the same thing. Anger management is good for the rage generation but not needed.
---
/cast charge
---
/cast stance 2
---
O good catch. I'd love my honorable kills from prior weeks!
---
&gt; You are choosing to be a dumbass and die then, lol. Warriors don't have the ability to stealth, who  cares if you choose not to use yours. It doesn't make things equal, at all.
---
Love how you don't add the bit where i say i am on a mount, well done! Explain to my how i am ment to stealth while riding? Warriors have the ability to close gaps, rend and slow. 
---
&gt; This is such a dumb remark. Wow a whole 3 seconds of being unstealthed at your choosing. If there's someone around you can just wait until they start picking the flower and then gank them, or if there's nobody around... Who cares either way?
---
Because we all run around stealthed? Dumb logic, i don't have stealth talents and move extremely slow and can be seen by most people with eyes.
---
&gt; I also highly doubt that when you do get ganked that you don't spam your vanish button like a mofo.
---
Gouge normally but your cute.
---
Ok, well I’m going to trust the warlock parsing &gt;99% for every fight in MC except for the one he is parsing at 96%
---
If you're playing long term then yes, if you can make 25 gold an hour on one toon and 80 on another on you will want to make a farm toon to save time
---
My point is if tank needs gear, he will ofc find a group. But if tank doesn't need gear he won't go and waste time and nerves in a pug for nothing. 
---
Tanks are the rarest role played and probably the most stressful. When I geared myself out, I never wanted to see Scholo/Strat/etc. again. I exclusively run it for compensation now because a lot of players still need gear from end game instances.
---
I am not sure what about this concept you find so hard to grasp?
---
I don't see how it is even controversial. At least this way you can pay a tank to do an instance he otherwise wouldnt
---
Yup. Idk about Hong Kong, but that layoff pissed me off
---
[Nothing has changed...](https://i.imgur.com/ZAQ3vkf.jpg)

Yes of course it’s frustrating, that wasn’t what i meant. It’s only a small ray of light in this hellhole we call phase 2.

Can’t wait for bg’s for all this wpvp to cool down, most ally are on the verge of quitting the game i think.

10366
---
Why is this sub so picky and petty? It's just an interesting pic* about how the server is balanced, no one said the census is 100% correct.
---
they tap to full mana then jump in and hellfire
---
I came to classic for that grinding gameplay. That alternative universe and to a world without flying and fun dungeon runs with randoms etc. 
---
I had tons of fun for a few months now. I love no flying. 
---
But..... I have played vanilla. I have seen it all before. And I am actually tired of conversing with players out of necessary. I am tired of any form of community. I like a community.....for a few hours a week....not all the time. 
---
I am tired of real life mates wanting to level together. I just want to chill and have no commitments. I don’t want to discuss what to do next or where to go next. I go where I please and it’s hard to say go fuck your self to real life mates. 
---
So I popped back into retail and I found that good feeling again. Everything I do can be done without speaking to anyone. Everyone knows what to do and can do it blindfolded. 
---
But. I will probably pop back into classic from time to time. It’s good as it’s core.
---
55-60 flies by for me. 
---
I normally do key quests and attunes at this period and also most of the 58+dungeon quests. 
---
Normally get 1 lvl per run with scholo/strat/LBRS. Each about 3-4hrs with all the running around for turn in.
---
I leveled a shaman from 50 to 60 as soon as p2 came out. BRD and the couple of mines in blasted lands is where i lived. Couple nights i played in the middle of the night and got to do ungoro quests and most of felwood/winterspring
---
2 rhings:
---
1. That the second phase, sons of flame during Rag, there were at least 20 to 30 elementals that spawned.
---
2. Warlocks were the most OP class
---
&gt;If only tanks who still needed gear were to run dungeons, you'd be waiting hours for a tank to come along.
---
I know you're being hyperbolic, but I sincerely hope this is not the case on your server.
---
If you're waiting for 30 minutes and send a message to a tank asking them to run a dungeon for you for $$$ then that's your perogative.
---
If a tank advertises that they will run x y and z for $$$, that's also their perogative, and it's mine to tell them they think very highly of themselves.
---
I just find it hilarious that you can write this:
---
&gt;It is you who is greedy here by wanting both the gold and your loot from the dungeon.
---
1/5 of the work, 1/5 of the reward. 
---
I'm not paying you just because you decided to choose the 'special' class who can't make gold any other way, which is what the post I initially replied to was promoting in the first place.
---
Haven't paid a tank yet, haven't waited hours either. Keep pushing that delusion though.
---
Your group wiped but you bubbled and made it to the exit?
---
Always reference UTC.
---
The real question is, where's Kilmador?
---
I think you might have some issues you want to work through with someone.
---
the horde are definitely wrong, but if you truly feel this way have you considered playing pve servers? because on pvp servers this griefing definitely goes both ways.
---
&gt; 2021 Burning Crusades
---
They've confirmed that there will be xpacs for Classic?
---
You just said you lost gear to a 58 shaman, also when you run for guildies that is helping out friends which I already mentioned.  Read my full post before replying twice, I said do you run instances where you need absolutely nothing and are NOT helping friends out so far both replies have been those.
---
It would depend on if anyone else needed it. But I'd ask before I rolled need if something dropped regardless.   If it's a dungeon I can get something out of I wouldnt ask for gold to do it, and it's rare I'd get an upgrade from something I'd ask for gold for.  But it did happen 2 nights ago, ran strat live for this group that was looking for a tank for a while, all I asked for was the first righteous orb. There was a rare spawn that dropped a nice ass belt I wasnt expecting, I asked them if it was cool if I rolled need since I was the only one that could use it and they said yea no problem.  I wouldnt have just rolled need without saying anything, but I dont see anything wrong with asking and rolling if they are cool with it.  But still I wouldn't charge gold for a run if I was expecting anything out of it.  And then dungeons that tanks can get things out of people dont usually need to pay a tank to do. Ive only ever charged for strat live and dire maul runs. Those seem to be the ones that need tanks the most.
---
&gt;But people expect ticket response times to be an hour.
---
You mean the thing that actually was normal in the vanilla days? My last ticket about someone scamming people took a week to get an answer to. Which didn't even match what i reported.
---
Alliance is just nicer imho. All horde areas with few exception (mulgure, stonetalon, barrens) are just drab shitholes.
---
This is what happens when WoW is your only source of dopamine.
---
You guys are facing the same problem as OSRS. PvPers treat the game like it's their life. They don't care about having fun, they care about winning, no matter how small the victory is.
---
You raid 1 goat and they never let you forget 🤣
---
Welcome to rolling on a PvP server.  This is what you signed up for.
---
If you really need to level an alt, go to an instance and grind it.  If it's literally impossible to level in any of these zones, you should have zero issues forming a group.
---
Sure, but why is your opinion better than mine? Why should no changes win out over changes? I’m not hearing a good argument just a lot of “I think”, “I want”.
---
It works both ways. Here's a real answer: I never said my opinion is better than yours.
---
He's welcome to do it and the group can always find another DPS in like 2 seconds. It's a sad fact for damage dealers that they are easily replaceable while you may just spend an hour searching for a masochist to tank Scholomance.
---
That's why tank will sell his service and warlock will get shit on. You can get pissed about it, but it is what it is. Everyone is welcome to play a tank, but they prefer mindlessly casting frostbolts, hence making tank service a valuable asset.
---
If you mount from lakeshire it is much safer, especially if you just jump down and do a lava hop.
---
*laughs in stone form*
---
I'll chime in and say the alliance groups farming horde at BRM and DM are pretty frustrating.
---
Gotta play what your friends are playing. I've always wanted to play horde, but every friend ever always wanted play on alliance.
---
I understand that this opinion will be unpopular, but if you're playing on a PVP realm, this kind of stuff is to be expected. It sucks, it makes playing or questing in towns impossible and there's sometimes jack you can do about it. Just report and move on. Either grind on mobs, quest elsewhere or play an alt.
---
The quantity of total players is much higher for horde. There will still be ques with cross realm
---
Would it? This is how the goblin guards in Booty Bay work - they only use their rifles if you're in an unreachable spot. You could literally just copy-paste whatever AI behavior blizzard programmed for this. 
---
The alternative is blizzard having GMs individually read (hundreds? Thousands?) reports, and then monitor to see if it's actually happening, and then issue the bans and warnings.
---
When you get a hand on the who list commands it's quite easy. 
---
For example if you type warrior 25-30 it will display all the warriors between lvl 25 and 30 currently online on the server. You can also replace the class by a zone name
---
Healbot has inbuilt mousover healing btw. No need to make macros with it.
---
Another alliance player that gets stomped on his server so assumes every single server is the same lmao... Go check out heartseeker, ally controlled PVP server by a large margin. "OnLY hoRDe aRe BaD GUys thIS is MY PrOOf"
---
Nice strawman.
---
You would be killed in BS anyway. And since graveyard is in Flame Crest - it take longer to run to your body in BS than in Searing Gouge.
---
Tbh this kind of thing is exactly why "no changes" could only ever have been a release-phase thing. This is what it was like in vanilla, this is what it's like to fully embrace the no changes mindset. I think it's super lame but also not surprising in the least; anyone who played vanilla should have seen this coming. 
---
Personally, this is the kind of thing that has me keeping an eye out for their plans on "Classic+". I'd love to see Classic but, you know, actually good. Bug fixes, actually somewhat balanced classes/specs that won't get laughed out of content, more even faction distribution (through real balance fixes like tweaking racials), etc.
---
&gt; The "no changes" stance is holding strong
---
Is it though
---
Everything you wrote could be said about Alliance gank squads. Literally impossible to level my alt in contested zones because I'm constantly getting ganked by paladins.
---
Weren't we all against the report button? Ironic
---
PvP uses a ton of shards. Sometimes you'll join an instance after some pvp event or mass handing out healthstones or whatever and you'll be out of shards.
---
Read my edit
---
I feel like that's at most a few lines of code.
---
Perhaps this isn't the era of wow for you then.    The goal was a recreation of the game as it was in 2006.   Not a modified version catered to what you think is everyone's idea of a fix
---
Yep.  It even says "stealthed player detected".
---
That's all I'm saying. It's not like i ask for a lot.  And it's never something I'd do after the fact. Meaning I would never like fill a group then when everyone gets there demand gold.  If I'm looking for gold I'd just post a 60 tank willing to do any dungeon for gold whisper me your offer. And then someone whispers me an offer and if it's fair were good to go. Usually its 10-15 gold.
---
&gt; the dumbed down version of MC
---
xD shame he missed the real MC, that was the actual guildbreaker lmao
---
Why wouldn't I? I'm looking for more am I not?
---
Why wouldnt it be? People are crying over being on a PvP server.
---
People who use their alts to post advertisement in trade they buy some stock freshly posted by their main on AH in order to encourage other people to buy it for the quick profit: hold my beer.
---
Amen
---
You can see your honor progress? I thought it was static until the next week where it updates.
---
Swapping servers is like wasting month of your playtime.
---
It's 2019 and I got banned before so I know I can't tell you why. What am I saying, ofc LOK'TAR OGAR!! Horde = ----- Alliance = ~~~~
---
Since a guy got a 35k fine is Canada for making a joke, tune in for my public execution
---
I‘m for #changes.
---
I want them to buff BG honor rewards and in return remove open PvP honor rewards completely, open PvP should be only about objectives (like resources or world bosses) not about points (this is for structured PvP), no rewards for slaughtering people who are just trying to do quests.
---
My brother quit too at 56
---
The disconnect happens if you untarget the person youre reporting before hitting submit
---
Because nobody knew how overpopulated servers would be. Nobody could have predicted how bad the problem would be.
---
Hey is this the option under raid profiles, Use Raid Style Party Frames? Does it basically make the frames in raid just like in a 5 person party? I haven't used it before but am trying to adjust my frames and Addons for raid healing. Tried the default frames last night in my first raid and didn't like it too much.
---
I like both retail and classic. Completely different games with different gameplay and “needs”. 
---
I played vanilla for two years straight back then. Every day. Raided etc. But that was then. And when I think back there basically were no alternatives in the gaming world. Wow was the only game I felt was good back then.  And I was not much more social back then either tbh. 
---
I play on pvp server but I don’t open world pvp at all. I don’t like it. Probably because it’s not large scale enough. I do play pvp games a lot. Shooters. And I play pvp in bgs. So for me I don’t really care about balance per se. Probably because everything is perfectly balanced in bgs and in all shooters.
---
But at the end of the day I am a wow fan. Have been since 2005 and I will probably be forever.
---
Not just the ogre-men, but the ogre-women, and orge-children too
---
You slow ppl really grind my gears... I get the click bait title (ooo blizzard doesn’t love us BS) but if you really play classic and think things are moving to fast... idk what to say... please leave my game alone.. if anything they should be releasing content faster.. we already know what’s coming.....
---
Do you seriously think there was the same amount of players in vanilla wow compared to classic
---
At low levels everyone needs spirit..especially casters
---
Lol maybe cloth but everything else looks better on and orc/cow
---
Seconding stingray, reporting in chat completely nukes my chat record. Makes it hard to report when multiple magats show up and start saying racist shit.
---
Why not? I fish while watching twitch all the time. Bind cast to a hotkey, listen for splash, click bobber, repeat.
---
iirc blizzard has high turnover on their support staff all the time and maybe they should, it's probably not a high skill position and can rehire with ample candidate pool when they need to scale up
---
Vanilla like populations would mean only 1/5th or maybe even 1/10th the amount of overbalanced faction hungrily seeking HKs. Opens up the world, means that any given 5 man should be able to fight their way to instances or survive boats without being overwhelmed by groups of 10-15. Players don't feel oppressed enough that they no longer bother trying. These current server numbers just preclude world activity by the disadvantaged faction. Predictable. 
---
&gt; Shamans also couldn't switch so it would be a logistical nightmare I guess.
---
Let them pick any class they want and start at level 50, all level 45+ quest flags reset (but no rewards other than XP for already finished quests), and permanent rested XP turned on. 
---
This faction balance problem is, even now, eminently solvable.
---
You should still go for the WW axe and get the axe specialization  in the arms three! Plus the axe does a lot more top end damage which is what you should be looking for.
---
So, you want a private server? Ok.
---
I see. I swear I thought Healbot did that before but maybe I'm mistaken. 
---
I'll just use Clique which basically creates those mouseover macros for you, and then use Healbot on top of that for the frames.
---
? i literally gave you multiple examples when you asked, i just had forgot it at first, and edited it in less than a min after posting.
---
&gt;No one ever stated that it was a perm ban.
---
"honestly imo it should be 48 hour warning, 7 days, 30, perm."
---
I brought up perm bans, then you came back and said there shouldnt be warnings.
---
Yeah I was here when an image of a GM asked in the chat for them to get down. Why can’t people ever fucking play this game or any game legitimately? Fuckers man.
---
I luckily made it to 50 before this went down. I'm a prot pally so I can heal, DPS, or tank. Plopped my character down in BRD with a practically empty inventory and have just been doing runs since.
---
Wtf lol. 80% of you guys were literally begging for this classic PvP experience before vanilla came out
---
There we go again with hating on the alliance.
---
And he probably still wonders why the orc warlock won’t cannibalize
---
Not really that sad I mean I want to level an alt but o sure as fuck don’t wanna do it again alone lol
---
21/3/27 is really strong with hemo CB and prep. Sword hemo. Also really fun to play with the big evisc crits and improv stealth and speed. Also the stealth detection
---
I'm not being hyperbolic. We've all seen groups LF tank for half an hour and more, and that's with plenty of tanks running instances for gold. If all these tanks were to stop doing that, obviously there would be even fewer tanks for instances, so waiting times would increase drastically. 
---
DPS classes don't run dungeon groups for gold once they're geared, they go to the appropriate solo farm for their class. I'm not thinking highly of myself, I *need* gold and if you're offering less than I would get from mining and herbalism, why would I go to a dungeon I need nothing from with you? Can you answer that question for a change?
---
You have a lot of contempt for warriors apparently, I wonder how much of that oozes into the game.
---
OP of that forum thread seems like a full conspiracy nutter. Analyzing colour schemes of expansion logos to claim Shadowlands will be a flip like WoD? Regardless of my opinions on Shadowlands, this just seems like complete and total schizo nonsense. He needs to seek help.
---
That's not uncommon for this sub to rehash posts in order to generate a lot of whoosh though.
---
Alliance is for kids (now adults).
---
Horde is for edgy teenagers (now edgy adults).
---
Lol what a fucking loser
---
except it just so happens to be true though...
---
Not really sure what point you're trying to make here. You're a rogue. Most rogues are dumb assholes.  Most rogues would also beat a prot warrior in a fight every single time in open world. Yes it takes a while to kill me but that doesnt matter much when I'm stunned for 5 fucking minutes.  You act like open world pvp is a 1 on 1 fair fight, when you know damn well it isnt. In a 1 on 1 fair fight maybe I can beat a rogue 50% of the time, in open world when a rogue comes from nowhere and I'm stunned for the entire fucking time? Yea no. You have no idea what pvpping is like for a prot warrior.
---
Oh did you get what you wanted? VANILLA.. the base game.. and your unhappy with it?
---
Yea that’s exactly what vanilla was like back in the day.
---
not locks... seriously.. no
---
Yes I had this same experience until I put all plate on, you don't need crit % and hit since you are such high leveled.
---
The alliance are alive and ganking on my server (Rattlegore).
---
Except for the fact that this server is almost 4x the size of the largest vanilla servers back in the day. Hell its even about double the size of nost at its most active. So no no one expected to have pvpers camping every square foot of the world.
---
So... what your saying is horde needs to start attacking IF? If you feel safe there, that's a problem.
---
What is "honor"? Tell me what exactly are the horde players supposed to do? Just stand around doing nothing?
---
You could throw a low level spell / instant cast to just get it out of the way. Got any Rank 1 instant casts?
---
A dps wanted 5 gold from each person for doing a dungeon.
---
Fuck these people who want gold for dungeons.
---
so you cant call any high level alliance player to get rid of them?
---
at my active time, long long ago, we were only one click away to take care of such campers.
---
but ban them? come on snowflake, here have hot milk and then hush to bed.
---
Shut up you fucking baby. This is what vanilla was like.
---
Why do most locks refuse to use bandages? Half don't even have First Aid leveled
---
It is as rare and valuable. Mean gold price on us servers is around 1500g(although that’s what people are posting it as). It’s a great Twink item
---
It builds, so something like -100, then -200, then -300, etc.
---
In vanilla we had a Grand Marshall tank himself back to 0 RP in a day.
---
Turn off error speech, ffs
---
Whoosh
---
Dark pact is trash.
---
Do AOE spells work on the totem?
---
If not the only instant I have is fire blast, but I don't want to waste that on a totem since it does a lot of dmg.
---
I could do rank 1 frostbolt I guess (1.0 sec cast), but how do I quickly identify when he's dropped the totem?
---
I thought you couldn't die in a duel. My warlock buddy did too. My first death in game was to him.
---
Didn’t you guys want an unaltered true vanilla experience with a 4:3 resolution, no QoL improvements and no fixes?
---
They just want to see the world burn.  They're not upset that they're killing the game, they're excited that they have agency in something.
---
We are 60 already, I feel sad about layers abuse (especially dungeon abuse) but it's past.
---
Ganking people in p1 was just for people self-satisfaction, when wpvp became relevant, layers were gone.
---
Still, you have actually pointed out everything I was dissatisfied about layers myself: maybe blizzard have done it in because it's better for them than merge servers.
---
Can someone explain to me how alliance rogues are able to get kills in Kargath. I understand IF because it's so spread out, they can easily find people to solo. Kargath has literal hundreds of people all in one area. I don't see how a rogue would have enough time to kill someone before being slaughtered by a mass of horde.
---
In the initial honor patch there weren't any dks so raid groups would clear out quest hubs and make it actually impossible, not just frustrating, for the opposite faction to quest for hours on end it was awesome and the tears were even more delicious then they are now.
---
Most internet janitors do it for free in multiple subs, tradition of sorts
---
No Changes is not remotely close to what we got... so how exactly is that "clearly the rational choice"?
---
Seriously, you say all of this as if No changes is what Blizzard gave us. It is not. We did not get the game we played. We did not get the known quantity. What we got was already different.
---
&gt;Changes is asking blizzard to figure out what every edge case of the community wants
---
First of all, no it isn't. You said it yourself - "just because they made some changes, doesn't mean they have to make more". To you I give the same response - "just because they can make some changes, doesn't mean they should make them all."
---
No one is asking for every edge case out there. We're asking for some very simple, very basic changes that no one could possibly be against unless they were against any possible changes like yourself... which you already did not get.
---
&gt;To risk their business spending money and time on making those changes.
---
It's not a risk to make the kind of changes I'm referring to. Not in the slightest. Nor would it take substantial amounts of time or money either.
---
You're acting like Blizzard hasn't already spent a fuck ton on Classic, as if it was just sitting there ready to be turned again... that's not the case. They had to redesign the game from the ground up, and they made *many* large changes a long the way. That took substantial amounts of time and money.
---
&gt;So I’ll ask again: what do you actually want Blizzard to do and why should they do it over what other people want?
---
Fix an in game exploit that shouldn't even be possible in game, considering it's outright explicitly a bannable offense, and will not effect anyone in this game negatively. That's what I want Blizzard to do.
---
THAT is the clearly rational choice. Again, I state, anyone who is against adding gaurds to the roof of this exploitable buildings, they have to be the ones looking to do the exploit themselves... because otherwise it literally has zero affect on their gameplay.
---
You think you're being the rational one... you're not.
---
Why would you assume I have contempt for warriors? I have contempt for people who think they deserve more than their fair share due to personal choices or reasons.
---
If you're able to milk gold out of people to run dungeons, wonderful. Again the fact that you can do anything in this game is the beauty of it, and if there's legitimately a market for dungeon runs due to scarcity the fact that you CAN capitalize on that means that you SHOULD because that's the reason we're playing a game from 2005.
---
But I'm definitely going to mock the people who think they deserve more because the class they chose can't make money otherwise. And doubly so when they assume that everyone else in the game is a stereotype that fits the worldview that THEY ARE SUPER IMPORTANT.
---
Look back at the first post I responded to. Nothing against warriors, nothing against tanks. All against the idea that one persons time is more valuable than anothers.
---
&gt;I'm not thinking highly of myself, I need gold and if you're offering less than I would get from mining and herbalism, why would I go to a dungeon I need nothing from with you?
---
Don't. Run a dungeon if you need to run a dungeon or want to run a dungeon. Or offer a dungeon run service for gold I don't care.
---
Funny that you're trying to have 3 things here though:
---
1. Warriors deserve money from gold runs because they have no alternatives. (I.E. Group should feel sorry for them.)
---
2. Warriors are doing a service. Without them DPS classes could never get gear. (And healers? They're oddly not mentioned are they in the DPS peasants class or the Tank aristocracy? Somewhere in the middle?)
---
3. "I don't need you why would I run this with you". 
---
Tanks need to gear themselves too. I haven't noticed any shortage of tanks. Should I be paying tanks that need to gear as well? It sounds like you're saying higher powered characters(Who don't need the run) should be able to charge for dungeon runs(Who need the run). Cool!
---
I'm wondering where the equivilancy of Higher power character=Tank came in though since it's not elitism and I just hate tanks apparently.
---
CUTE!! C(◕ᴗ◕✿)
---
Dominos can hide it, dunno if there's a smaller addon.
---
And people wonder why alliance are quitting LULW
---
Had a lock do this to me as well.  After I ran a dungeon over twenty times to see it drop.  Fuck em.
---
I didn't even know of this item. The drop rate looks absurdly low. Good investment.
---
&gt; Pvp servers arent as bad as this thread is suggesting.
---
Multiple examples of entire zones being overrun by death squads.
---
Yeah, it is.
---
Just to clarify, that idea of "world pvp" did exist. It just doesn't in WoW Classic. Private servers were nowhere near on this level of scale. While leveling you had STVietnam and maybe some other run ins at the max zones, but the game was still totally playable. 
---
I have some guesses, but I can't tell what exactly is different for sure. All I know is that now I'm one of the people raid logging.
---
I've quit playing until bgs or something comes out to combat this those who say donr choose a PvP server, hat about this senseless bullshit? Heres looking at you grobbulous
---
My guild won't up and move again. We transferred from bigglesworth to anathema. Originally we were planning on whitemane once the servers launched, but it filled up so fast we said nah and abandoned that idea.
---
QQ more novice
---
That doesn't imply that it only counts 1 person at a time, it's still parsing /who results like I gave in the quote. There were also faulty census readings of various servers that gave 99-1 faction splits simply because nobody on the "1%" faction ran a /who parse.
---
Again I ask you, where are you getting *your* data from and can I have a link?
---
I’m dead lmao
---
LOL tldr. I remember all these stupid great american novels butthurt alliance players who wanted to carebear on PVP servers wrote back in original wow too.
---
It's just as bad on, Arugal. Pretty much every Australia, New Zealander and plenty of Asian countries all on pretty much just 1 PVP server. It's about 80/20 Horde dominant. People will dispute that, but usually, they are horde players, who enjoy the status quo because it suits them essentially.
---
I definitely hear maxmoefoe in this video, watched it last night. He was one of the contestants for the costume contest.
---
I've never understood the lowbie camping for hours on end. Are you really that fucking bored?
---
Lmao typical horde edgelord hahahahahaha u fit the bill
---
&gt;Ganking people in p1 was just for people self-satisfaction
---
Yep, as it should be. And I made the best out of it, even if it was annoying with layering, and that people would rather layer out over contesting certain quest areas.
---
The addition of honor makes no difference in my eyes, if I see an enemy that I believe I can beat (even if I do him dirty) I fucking attack, if I die in the fight or get honor doesn't matter at all to me.
---
Wpvp is just fun.
---
Spirit increases life regen which increases sustainability in solo play.
---
ok
---
I'm not, actively play both.
---
It is but if you're drain tank specced you take it and use your felhunter. It actually makes questing quite easy. I havent stopped at all to drink since I respected. Theres times when you're fighting that you dont wanna tap because its gonna out you in danger of dying. That mana from dark pact may be just what you need.
---
But they aren't? Last i checked no healer can conjure water. They have to buy water. 
---
You refusing to bandage or eat puts the cost on them. That's why it's an issue.
---
Thunderfury in the last 7 days has been 76% active level 60 alliance. And it's a 48/52 level 60 ratio.
---
That's the spirit!
---
You force me off my server I'm quitting, this is a terrible idea. I've played on overpopulated and underpopulated servers and I will always take overpop.
---
It’s true, reading through your drivel has made me a bit dumber.
---
What the fuck am I supposed to be watching?
---
MSBT(Miks scrolling battle text)
---
So you make the healer waste water or money. Seems like equal commitment to the game. /s
---
I believed that critical percent was weighted so that you'd get so many criticals in X amount of time.  If you got less you'd be more likely to critical, and if you got more you would be less likely.  Like face cards in blackjack you could "count" criticals.
---
People are bad at understanding percentiles.
---
Okay: then the current situation is in your favor I guess, no more layers and servers population is healthy.
---
Why should a tank come into your group if he needs nothing from that dungeon? You are not forced to take their offer but what they do is increase the pool of tanks who go into dungeons. You can either keep on searching for a tank who needs something from that dungeon or for a tank who is a guild mate or friend of someone in your group or you take the offer. More choice is always better than less choice. The alternative of him offering that service is him not going into a dungeon at all and just making gold another way.
---
It’s pure stupidity to complain about tanks who offer their service for gold.
---
There are so many guilds out there. Definitely leave that one and find another. That’s completely wrong.
---
I know what spirit does. Im telling you a lock that prioritizes spirit over ANYTHING is not a good lock.
---
Yeah, I really should have. I was almost 40 when they quit and didn't have enough gold for a mount. But I didn't know they quit until like 2 weeks later when they stopped logging on.
---
Give some form of description for those who don't want to click a random link?
---
True, it won't go away, but perhaps it will be reduced enough for the game to be playable on some servers.
---
This is how it was back in the day if you dont like it you shouldn't have joined a pvp server.
---
That link is one hell of an aids
---
Well, the dropoff was going to be big no matter what, they were correct in that sense. It just sucks that some of it is self-fulfilling now, with people quitting because of the conditions they created.
---
This is why we let you die in dungeons, locks. I stop healing locks when ooc if they dont make an effort to recover in some way.
---
Nowhere as bad as it is now. But you wouldnt know since you're not playing.
---
The elusive boomchicken.
---
Warlocks can solo dire maul jump runs. These runs are profitable for groups of 2-3, so doing it solo is actually insane gold per hour
---
Why are there so many Gnomes!?
---
I know they're the best spellcasters, but do people really care about optimizing that much?
---
Feralas, Tanaris, Winterspring and Feelwood is where I mostly see alliance.
---
It is awesome that there is the potential for supply and demand economics in a game, no issue with that. I haven't found tanks to be quite as scarce as seems to be portrayed but anecdotes vs anecdotes.
---
Definitely gonna make fun of the elitism and self-pity from "I can't make money any other way so I DESERVE THIS" though.
---
Tanks are the small fish or the big fish not both.
---
Man, its a gif.
---
Just get in there and do it. It only takes 1-3 runs to learn each dungeon. Ask some guildies to group up including someone who's tanked and can direct you while you learn. Keep at it and soon you'll feel very confident leading any pug
---
The scary thing is that if this keeps up like this once Blizz implements paid transfers there’s going to be such a mass exodus to PVE servers that I think most PVP realms are going to die.
---
Horde or Alliance?
---
Youve got to remember noone waited months for it like they did this time round. It was just a new thing that people did and it grew in Popularity. Noone had a clue on the system.
---
Now people have waited months to them game/farm the system and know exactly how to do it.
---
5 man squads farming honor with specific aims were non existent. Let alone epic geared, discord using min maxers.
---
What about faction-specific quest rewards? Reputation? Racial abilities? There’s just so many reasons why it wouldn’t work
---
I just think more strict server limits and balance oriented faction-specific queues (eg if there’s only 1000 alliance on, only 1000 horde can log) or something along those lines would be a much more practical way to achieve balance
---
people like you are the reason why others are quitting
---
As a further note, on my server in vanilla, there was no "bracket management"
---
It's kinda like a game from 2004 only works for so long 15 years later huh who woulda thunk it.  Not to mention there is pretty much nothing to do end game in classic but pvp.  Not even that different from pvp in retail except you don't have much of a reason to do world pvp and you can opt out.  Factions on every server are still extremely polarized.
---
What did you actually expect?  Vanilla was a good game for its time and had a million issues which are just going to be exasperated by higher populations.  Every expansion since has brought QOL changes and additions that better the game.  BC was much better than vanilla.  BFA is literally the only expansion that introduced nothing new that was fun (lol@expeditions), even WoD was really fun til the content drought.
---
Vanilla is literally one of the worst iterations of WoW and idk why anyone pushed for that instead of something like WOTLK.
---
I agree, just giving you a warlocks perspective.  Warlocks can eat/drink like everyone else
---
You're asking a lot as a new player to the guild. Some new players to my guild have asked for similar. That always came across as entitled and/or needy/greedy. If you join a guild and basically raid log you can't expect loot immediately.
---
Jup. My 22 tank finds groups in 3 secs. I mean it was the same on pvp servers but even as a dps you get into groups more easy
---
Gathering data isn't hard if you know how. You can use the population add-ons and their associated sites to see where the huge population disparities are which are clearly happening on several servers based on that data. Then you check forums like this or the official ones and see what people are saying about these same servers and people are indeed saying that it's just corpse camping for hours and leveling can't be done. As to checking servers for opinions I know it's happening on my server Kirtanos to some extent and our faction balance isn't even that bad. But you keep telling yourself that the people saying it isn't fun and quitting are the problem and it has nothing to do with the people using them as a resource despite the negative outcomes.
---
Pretty accurate
---
I’ve had one for weeks, difference being I didn’t need to post an overdone meme ding 60 for validation, so there is no reddit record. Stay salty.
---
Hardly helps me as a paladin get kills lol. It does help me know when a rogue stealths near me so I can pop consecration. 
---
But I already knew that before I had Spy because I had my combat log open and all horde actions colored bright pink. I downloaded spy because I liked that it tracked how many kills between you and another player there are.
---
I'll tell you what DOES help me get kills - 5stacking reckoning before I head out ;)
---
Welcome to goodburger, home of the goodburger, can I take your order?
---
As a rogue it depends on the mob for me. 
---
Any clothy mobs are great and can easily keep doing them for 10-15% of a level
---
thats why i keep a bunch of lvl 5 food on me for the illusion of self sufficiency.
---
BooHoo, my enemy is killing me! 😭😭😭
---
Alliance weakness is a disease and I will not let it infect the Horde! Lok’tar Ogar!
---
You get honor proportional to the amount of damage you did in the combat that killed them. So if you do 100% of their remaining 20% life when hey are out of combat you get full honor for the kill. If the other mob did most of the damage? Then you get less honor. 
---
What people used to do on my server was wait till you were fighting a mob and then hit you 1-2 times before keeping you incapacitated long enough for the enemy mob to kill you and you take durability loss.
---
Do they not teach what supply and demand is in school anymore?
---
No need to prioritize it over anything. But at low levels it is certainly like second or third prio.
---
Just announce that you don't know the dungeon and just keep going the way you think you should. If you're wrong someone will point it out, And direct you. If they don't just keep pulling and eventually you will find the way.
---
In either case you would have learned where to go.
---
Repeat until you know every dungeon.
---
Will you make mistakes? Yes. Maybe overlook a pat or two and get adds? Sure. It's all part of the learning process.
---
&gt;We’re not even talking about the same things...
---
Thats been established. You read it wrong from the start. That still doesn't change the things you said. You also have yet to explain what you said, or admit what you said is absolutely incorrect.
---
Ashkandi is pretty bustling, but it can be annoying to find weekday groups after 9pm EST if you aren't connected to a tank or healer. It doesn't completely die, and is not impossible, but it's hit or miss.
---
the fix would be faction balance
---
dont care if they use faction ques, transfers, or buffing alliance to get it
---
it isnt fun for anyone when servers arent 50/50ish in world pvp
---
you aren't technically wrong? it does visually lower the levels, but it doesn't improve hit/proc/ect. your character is just so drunk he believes he is stronger
---
I am having fun?
---
He should've only died ten times so he can't complain!
---
Yes, it is, that's why I said it. The only thing that changed so far is release schedules for content, but I don't think something like releasing DM or BGs earlier than originally planned would count as a negative change.
---
Why
---
I’m on Earthfury. I’m 100% convinced it’s the best server in the game. Super balanced, very active, but it’s not so insanely high pop that everywhere you go late game is jam-packed. I can go anywhere and feel pretty confident that I can play the game without too much hassle, though sometimes Horde do a bit of camping if I’m not careful.
---
Overall it’s been a really great experience here. I came from Skeram which is an absolute hell-hole.
---
Use Morgan's Vigil or Lakeshire
---
No, they count as your 'pet', thus the DK would be yours.
---
***
---
Durability taken doesn't care that they're a pet, just that they died due to taking damage that wasn't a player caused killing blow.
---
Everything in the zone drops buff providing items that are strong for raids, so people will be literally everywhere farming random stuff. On top of that, it is the better place for farming timbermaw rep if you can lock down the area, which I think has a few quests, but good luck getting them done, if your faction controls it, hope you get in a group so you can tag something, if the enemy faction controls it, there really isn't anywhere else to do those quests.
---
There’s nothing wrong with doing things to mitigate known flaws in the game to make the experience more enjoyable for everyone and easier to moderate.
---
Expecting a game running on 13 year old mechanics riddled with various weaknesses that everyone and their mom has been aware of for over a decade to not be exploited is asking for trouble, for both the players and the people in charge of enforcing the rules.
---
The fact that this has become such a big problem and that tickets are taking so long to resolve speaks to the fact that not fixing these issues is not sustainable long-term.
---
The game as it was in 2006 was flawed. They can patch the known, actual **issues** without changing the fundamental aspects of the game. Some of these legacy shortcomings are game-breaking problems in many instances because *everybody* who’s been playing WoW since the beginning is aware of how to exploit them.
---
Big if true
---
Would nerf my ability as a PVP healer to see attacks against other players /shrug
---
I started WoW with classic. I have 2 level 60 horde characters so far. I went horde because my long time friends who have played WoW forever are horde. I want to eventually make an Alliance character, so that I can experience their side. The races look much nicer to me, but I don't mind horde either.  I probably would have made an Alliance character already if it let me make one on the same server under the same account. I don't want to buy another sub under another account either and try to maintain both.
---
I see nonstop hate for gnomes, but that's the first thing I'd make if I ever play alliance.
---
Nobody believed me when I prioritized spirit for my warrior.
---
Outleveled all of them.
---
So pvp in a pvp spec instead?
---
hEaLtH rEgEn
---
Where's the source on the average player reaching 60 in a month? Sounds way faster than average.
---
I have played with a lot of people who are not very good at the game, but I still don't kick them.
---
My first ever character was in a Night Elf Hunter in vanilla. I don’t know why but I played with my camera zoomed all the way in first person mode until like level 15.
---
Still remember some gnome I bumped into in Darnasus guided me from Darn to IF. Wetlands still gives me ptsd.
---
uh ohhhhh
---
how was that real world politics? are nazis bad? if a swastika offends you more than a hammer or sickle, the education system failed you hard. And if you think calling nazis bad is political, youre terrible
---
I call BS
---
yep ;)
---
Ask for help from your group. But don't expect them to actually help you. I usually only ever tank Jed/Rend runs of UBRS but then when I did a full clear I told my group I didn't know how to handle pulls beyond Rend and asked for advice. I was given zero advice and told to hit them with my sword. So I charged into the pull and 2 pats showed up and wiped us.
---
guess I was fortunate enough to roll on grob, switched from horde to alliance and it was around the same, but I think the horde on grob personally out number the alliance in terms of zone coverage, even though its an “even” split
---
Got one in my guild, all the casters want to be in a group with him during raids lol
---
No changes
---
&gt; It's almost like you think tanks are in limited supply or something
---
they literally are
---
lmao
---
thats why they get away w/ charging
---
also if the tank needs gear from the the dungeon they usually dont charge
---
the most famous charging instance is strat:live because it doesnt drop much tank loot
---
2 grown men abusing a lone male is a okay though.
---
Probably druid since the 4 set from blue set literally gives additional move speed in their cougar form making them run at roughly 60% mount speed. Crazy overpowered for flagcarry.
---
Every class has a really strong 2 set bonus of attack power, spellpower or whateer they need. So for healers and dps it will most likely be BiS to use a 2 set bonus from the blue set in PVE. Getting rank10 to have the flexibility to change those 2 slots is typically needed.
---
As for wsg meta nad premade vs premade stuff I think Ohhgee made a ton of really good videos about this:  [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwdUQvn5wiWEcjHE77k4Dnw](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwdUQvn5wiWEcjHE77k4Dnw) 
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BldVX-FbPos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BldVX-FbPos&amp;t=2s) \- this one in particular.
---
And the wolf and raptor are easily as cool as the tiger.
---
Yes yes many players use that argument. The single player argument. And nothing wrong with it.
---
But! There is a difference between not wanting to communicate and not wanting a community one must interact with, to that of a pure lonely experience of single player. 
---
See. I like to feel a human. I like to look at other ppl. I like to be in a world buzzing with real life (as in real players). That’s what retail provides. Ppl everywhere, but strangers. I feel no commitment to them. And since things are faster paced and generally easier one does not have to use energy to write in chat or discuss etc. Ofc I don’t talk about mythic Pluss content as that is extremely much harder than anything classic will ever come up with. 
---
I play with the same mentality I have in real life. I can talk to ppl and be very social in short stints. Then I need to be alone for some time (hours or even days and sometimes a week).
---
t. Off tank
---
&gt;*but most people who aren't on Reddit simply don't care very much*
---
The people enjoying the game are playing the game, the ones that aren't are complaining on forums.
---
Gauging the state of a game based on the forums is like gauging the health of a society by its looking at its hospitals.
---
To be fair ita how original wow worked as well.
---
Yep not that bad but i have 2 friends at r5 99% now with 1 and 2 DKs.
---
On my server, KromKrush, you will die when you get to the mountain.
---
I understand it's nice to have an area to yourself but it would've been nice it was more balanced somehow (no clue how as they understandably want people to choose there own server and faction).  
---
As it is now in this realm, they gravely outnumber us. Getting spawnkilled is the norm in a lot of areas, which causes some people to not play or even migrate, which makes the problem worse. 
---
In a way it's cool that the possibility is there and that one faction can sorta "win" the realm, but I think it's bad long term. Not just for Blizzard as they might lose players, but also for the "winning" players. After all, what's the point of a PVP server is there are barely any enemies around anymore? They're already fighting for the kills.
---
I guess the worst will be over once they all reach rank 14, but that could take a while.
---
&gt; it’s like you try harder if you’re accountable to your guild.
---
Accountability and reputation are HUGE in classic.
---
Lmao. I love this shit. People aggressively upvoting because it confirms their bias and as soon as one guy says why do you think this is a horde thing he gets downvoted.
---
You guys need to get your heads out of the sand. There’s nothing about being one faction that makes you a scum bag. People are just scum bags. And there are scum bags all over the entire population.
---
Just because there are less alliance doesn’t make them some oppressed group who are the TRUE pvpers and only lose cause they are or numbered 
---
I highly doubt there are any meaningful difference in skil between the population.
---
But if you don’t coddle to players who picked alliance you get bombed.
---
Tbh that’s one thing I do prefer about alliance. The main ones are meh but I wish the winter spring mount was cross faction, that thing is awesome.
---
If you judge your self esteem and knowledge from votes you are in for a hard life mate. Or alternatively you have no integrity and just write what other ppl write.
---
Lol this one is pure gold :)
---
That's inevitable because of the design flaw of PvP servers.  Imbalances lead to greater imbalances.  Nobody joins a losing faction.  IMO, free faction specific transfers to losing factions and from winning ones can only make things better.
---
I've noticed people do it at 60. During the leveling process, I don't think I saw a single lock use Bandage. I do remember one rogue using it tho.
---
Ehh having the suc out is pretty garbage against rogues now that the trinket is out.
---
early tanking go deep protection + improved taunt for 2 sec reduction (and obviously take shield slam) and take tactical master
---
I believed using fire spells might damage quest items like hides, Zhevra hooves, raptor heads etc.
---
Fix your map lol
---
Just quit. It’s easy. Bunch of great mmo’s out there!
---
Your complaints about world and NPC design are valid, but Paladins are the best PvP class in the game.
---
I'll always heal if I'm full HP and we aren't rapid pulling, or during the fight.
---
But I'm not healing someone who is life tapping between fights instead of drinking water like everyone else.
---
Cross server. It's not gonna be a problem.
---
Warlocks scare priests all the time but a good warlock should be able to take care of themselves.
---
I just got this and I now wonder how I played without it
---
Thank you! This is great will check it out. 
---
Do you know how well the mage gear is?
---
I use first aid, its really nice tbh
---
Guy needs to find a new guild
---
I might play retail but shadowlands is one of the first expansions I won’t buy on day 1. I’m gonna wait at least a month for reviews
---
This is boring as hell for horde too, but it's the only way to get honor and unfortunately the pvp gear is god tier right now so there's a very strong incentive for this toxic behavior and no   better way to farm the honor without battlegrounds.
---
Save people. And when you can't. Eat them.
---
42% according to my calculations
---
This is my solution. Making pretty quick progress on a hunter alt for DMT. 
---
Honestly, if the first class you leveled in classic was a warrior, you’ll love leveling an easy mode alt, especially if you have some gold to twink it out a bit. It’s blazing fast, AND you can actually fight back in pvp. 
---
I’m at 35 in ~40-45 hours /played, with ~50 HKs. Been a great time.
---
My guy you really seem to be struggling with supply and demand. If you can find tanks who are willing to tank for free in an acceptable time frame for you that's great. Most people can't and are willing to pay for a tank who otherwise would not be running the instance. It has nothing to do with elitism or thinking highly of yourself. Do you think the only guy on the server who can craft lionheart helm is an elitist for charging an exorbitant fee to craft? Lmao
---
Yeah, because no one ever tried to efficiently grind honor to reach rank 14 in Vanilla? Sure, there are more total players, as well as a higher tendency for people to max things nowadays, but the hardcore players are the same as always.
---
Are you sure he had holy nova in this spec?
---
Lol bonus DKP for using consumables? The things you're supposed to use anyway because you're supposed to care? 
---
Find a new guild buddy.
---
Ok, didn't go back to see the edit but do you understand where I'm coming from now and the other tanks that have no reasons to run dungeons.  They help others get their gear while also making it worthwhile for them to even run the dungeon since they don't need anything.
---
Not even faction balance, the fix is reducing server size and adding battlegrounds, stat.
---
Like everyone’s saying, train everything. It’d be foolish to not use, say a pole arm that has 10 DPS more because you are only trained in axes
---
Not even in the game yet, and even then you're better off with 2x Bone Slicing Hatchet.
---
Edit: *That* is BiS, chief.
---
They addressed this by announcing BGs
---
Been having that problem the past few days as well.  My guess was something with the ads and videos on the site.
---
Meanwhile I can find 5 other dps in 30 seconds. 
---
Have fun waiting 45 minutes for a tank
---
You thought you did but you didnt 
---
J Allen Brack probably jacking off to the amount of salt on the forums right now
---
This is a good one.  
---
The game hadn't been fully data-mined, and there *are* little storyline nuggets in-game that allude to this possibility.  
---
It wasn't crazy that people thought this one was real.
---
Yeah reading and typing is hard.
---
I never heal Warlock who consume their own life for mana. Then they take aggro and they die. Once they are at 0 durability they just stop doing it and start drinking.
---
Fun. You're garbage with language if you didn't spot your own implication, and an elementary troll if you did.
---
From what I recall it's better than anything else right now other than epic, but I'm not certain. Also the 2 set is amazing for pve, boots+gloves is a great start and I think shoulder+gloves becomes BiS until full AQ gear
---
Roughly 800 stacks of runecloth if you didn’t do the quests in the beginning
---
I've leveled like 5 warlocks to max level since OG vanilla. Spirit is 2nd best stat for lvling after shadow/magic dmg.
---
Blizzard needs CS/GM employees in order to do that.  Not only have they made their CS/GM team "lean" but also considering this is a holiday weekend I imagine there are number that are also away with their family so I can't imagine there are very many people available to handle things on the spot
---
I thought you’d use the succ for drain tanking?
---
Just use the short ones. It's super useful in a raid to see summoning X instead of 4 locks all summoning the same player. But I agree the long texts are mostly cringy with a few funny ones thrown in.
---
I guess me and the blue post are wrong, which is fair, you probably havd an uncle who works at Blizzard.
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/overcrowded-realm-update/255835
---
Retail players be like:
---
tUrN wArMoDe OfF!
---
Yes it is.  You're too dumb to realize that player activity and behaviors don't scale with server size.
---
&gt;There is no way this is fun for anybody involved on either side
---
This is simply not true.
---
Im one of those 🤦‍♂️or was...
---
Sure expansions die out but BfA was one of only expansions where it happened so fast. Judging by my friends list and players in the world most players including myself quit BfA within a month while other expansions lasted several months
---
And humble! Make some more internet callouts, this is fun
---
Im a lock with tailoring, and I also don't get to sink too much time in the game, so grinding or buying a lot of cloth is not possible most of the time.  Now that I'm leveling an alt, i have the ability to send some cloth my lock's way.
---
I'm lvl 35 with First Aid 231, it would be dumb not to. One day I'll get to 60.
---
&gt;5g per portal.
---
A tank is far more valuable than a warlock summon. Most people will not pay 5g for a summon. Supply and demand my guy
---
&gt; He's welcome to do it and the group can always find another DPS in like 2 seconds.
---
The guy you are replying to is totally missing this lol. If a lock wanted to start charging 5g for summons it would be a quick kick and he would be replaced within 30seconds. Who cares? People run to the dungeon all the time without summons. *People don't run dungeons without tanks.* It's not even remotely comparable.
---
Cities = Ally 
---
How armory looks = Ally
---
Leveling = Horde 
---
But I ultimately went Horde and am glad I did. I really hope we can push all the ally off our server.
---
To each their own lmao.
---
And likewise, you can have bad officers that make dumb loot council decisions. It's not a reflection on loot council.
---
It’s habit. Let the healer know you got bandages before the dungeon start.
---
They get only a renew from me. Only exclusion to that would be if they're my only AOE in The Lyceum and they're hellfiring. I *need* them to survive so I'll properly heal them then. Otherwise it's just one single renew.
---
dope screenshot tho!
---
People mostly did it in bgs in vanilla
---
After I wrote this comment, and started to think about it, let me amend my prediction.  "Uh...we're going to have Naxx by next fall."
---
Your argument is fair, that 6 months plus 6 months plus 6 months puts us in 2021.  However, nobody anywhere in blizzard ever said 6 months per raid tier.  I hope Blizzard doesn't rush it the content phase releases (6 months apart would be fantastic) but I think they will.
---
Where are you seeing this elitism and entitlement? Literally everyone is telling you it's supply and demand and you respond b-b-but!!
---
You were extremely lucky to get it in so few runs. It has less than a 1% drop rate (considering Gorosh spawn rate).
---
The community is starting to realize how broken certain aspects of Classic really are. They should have put in a better honor system but people would have just stupidly yelled no changes. Classic WoW is not a game that is designed around being balanced or fair. It’s a game where a small amount of people are the hammers and everyone else are the nails.
---
Are you waiting for the realization that you are being absurd?
---
Lmao so stupid.  Every WoW expansion has had insane sales no matter what.  Classic will not have an effect on that in any major way.
---
There goes the dead night elf ghost, so fast!
---
I'm starting to think you don't know what elitism means
---
Locks get the worst regen from spirit of any class in the game. SP &gt; Crit &gt; Hit &gt; Int/Stam &gt; Spirit. It's literally garbage for us.
---
It’s classic WoW - the game everyone wanted. What is your point here?
---
Vanilla WoW used this honor system, which was objectively terrible, but obviously Classic was going to use it as well.
---
Cope
---
The problem is your using shadow wrath gear over real gear... That gear is only ok for raiding and even then it is garbage imo you need to get real gear for soloing, the point of Shadow wrath gear is to have just enough hp and Mana to survive fights while putting all your stats into damage, when your soloing that is a terrible idea.
---
If your fighting the sac boss you need to keep shadow ward up 100% of the time for incase you get sacrificed especially if you barely have 3k hp. But honestly DM east is more about just getting the rhythm down, I've cleared it naked to show other guildies how to do it.
---
“Of you don’t play warrior the way I’ve suggested then maybe warrior isn’t for you.”
---
What an absolute dork.
---
I agree but I didn't say that nor did anyone in this immediate thread. I know why you brought it up - because it's a valid and, for you, personally important point to notice. Not sure that it needed to be mentioned here though.
---
Sounds like a shadow priest healing. It can be fine sometimes but Strat live is a tad too brutal for shadow priest healing.
---
When I wasn't in the mood for dungeons, I would solo farm the bats in EPL, mobs in Winterspring, or grab a warr friend and do Tyr's Hand. Now there's at least 10+ Horde waiting at every FP and death squads going around all the end game zones. The only way I'm able to actually farm is waking up early and farming demons in North Azshara for felcloth or fishing for Winter Squid near Steamwheedle Port. Seems like other people had the same idea because I went from making 10-12g a stack on squid to a flooded market of ~5g a stack for Grilled Squid. 
---
I really only log on to work on setting up my twink and raid nights. A lot of my friend group slowed down playing the last couple weeks. One friend is outright mad because he was pushing for a PvE realm. It's a shame.
---
Because once BGs are out, trying to rank with wpvp is not worth it at all compared to other ranking with BGs.
---
reducing server size would be extremely harmful
---
lowering pop is what killed off a lot of retail servers back in the day
---
WE NEED BALANCE, not smaller servers
---
(S)He’s his own best friend.
---
I'd count yourself lucky only sinking 30 minutes into that guy.
---
The state of the PvP servers is obviously terrible for now, but converting them to PvE defeats the purpose of the server; anyone who rolled PvP did it expecting they would be part of the "real" or hardcore server, and this is exactly what that means.  Letting people transfer from PvP to PvE would be a great way to let people get back to enjoying the game, but people need to take responsibility and accept that they chose the wrong type of server instead of blaming Blizz or the rest of the server for not giving them what they hoped for.
---
eh, spamming purge and earthshock/frostshock, or as I saw yesterday, getting lighningbolt/frostshock crit for 3.5k dmg in a global, are significantly more useful and fun (as is windfury totem)
---
paladins are better pve healers and have salvation, and that's it
---
Okay so a couple things 
---
1.	 Spec prot
---
2.	DONT say you don’t know the run because people will judge you. Go in and start tanking shit it’s not hard no boss on the easier instances will cause problems 
---
3.	alternatively look up YouTube guides on dungeon runs 
---
4.	start with BRD and get some blues, download atlasloot to see which bosses drop what. 
---
5.	BRD —&gt; Scholo/strat—&gt; LBRS/UBRS
---
6.	once you’re geared out you can start off tanking MC and DM and get upgrades that way
---
7.	do all that get bored and play something else
---
This is honestly fucking hilarious.
---
But seriously, why don't you just group together and try to exterminate them? There are tons of ghost alliance players running with you, and you when you are scattered like that it just makes you easy prey.
---
I've rerolled alliance now to try help with the faction imbalance, and from my experience alliance usually just seems way more passive when it comes to PvP in general. If I play on horde and ask to slay some alliance scum people are immediately up for it, while on alliance people just want to do PvE content.
---
PvP servers are for PvP, and there seems to be a lot of people who just imagined that PvP servers on vanilla would be the same as they are on retail, where it might as well be labeled "PvE or normal".
---
Will do! Thanks!
---
Depending on how you want to do things, you can use really any pet that's not the VW.  Succubus is the preferred one, if I remember correctly, because of the combination of good dps and high mana pool to siphon from.  Imp has more mana but it can't be used to DPS without using that mana, so they're pretty much just walking mana pools, and IIRC Felhunters have some different utility but for raw speed/efficiency in drain tanking the succubus is the best choice.
---
Yeah, but back then there was also time between the honor system dropping and BGs being released.
---
Only ones that change combat log messages, but it shouldn't cause a crash. Could you DM me a copy/paste of the error you're receiving?
---
[I think this is worth a watch. Even this video isn't nearly as bad as it is on some servers, and imagine if they weren't a rogue?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=449&amp;v=ctn-tKXx4Sw&amp;feature=emb_title)
---
I ran with a lock recently that would life tap himself to full every time he realized he was at like 75% mana. I swear he hit life tap more than anything else.
---
I don’t know what I expected. Whenever we stopped for mana breaks, with a mage in the group who offered water, he’d tap himself down to like 2 HP if he had to and just stand there.
---
No alliance towards my faction. Played alliance into MC and horde into 14/15 Naxx in vanilla. I enjoyed horde more but that's probably only because I went deeper in pve on that character and we wrecked in pvp back then, both world and BG's.
---
You should be able to find groups for SM Cath or ZF. I love grouping with warlocks as a healer, befriend some healers!
---
Legion was good. BFA was a dumpster fire.
---
I couldn't really find any information regarding this topic. Thanks a lot for your input fellow redditors. :)
---
Except once you do queue you can leave and do whatever you want. And since population are so ridiculously horde skewed, they're going to likely have 30min plus queue times. Which means they'll be free to go right back to neckbearding.
---
Not sure that I understood, why would you want to see only vendor price total?
---
Wanting source on a claim makes you a jabroni?
---
K?
---
I disagree. Any tank can sell their services, regardless of gear and knowledge. It’s an open market though, so they’re incentivized to make themselves appealing over the other tanks, or the wait to find a free one.
---
I can't take you seriously when you say you cant blame the people doing it
---
You choose to play on a mega server when blizzard even stated that low pop server are bigger then full vanilla servers. You guys thought that staying on these servers were a good idea. This doesnt require any blizzard attention. You guys are just whinning
---
They can solo DM:E jump runs. Warriors can only duo at best, most will have to do it with three.
---
true
---
As a NE Warrior, 100% this.
---
Raiding or pvp?
---
I pretty aggressively help guildmates and friends, but it's not my obligation to do so.  I don't understand this attitude that people like you seem to have where if guildies don't spend X amount of their playtime helping you in specific they're somehow bad guildies.  Like, you know what I did while I was gearing up and running tons of dungeons?  I made groups, and put one message in guild chat that I'm running this dungeon and if anyone wants to go we have these spots available.  That's it.  I didn't huff and puff because people were doing other shit a lot of the time.  Getting geared out takes a ton of time and I have nothing but sympathy for people who complete their dungeon sets wanting to take a huge break for them or even never run those dungeons again.  It's not "I got mine so fuck you" it's "I got mine and one of the rewards for doing so is I don't have to run those dungeons ever again if I don't want to; why can't you just put in the same effort I did?"  Do you expect guildmates who put in a ton of time grinding thousands of gold to get everything they could spend gold on for their character to keep grinding gold to give to you instead of enjoying the fruits of their labor by just sitting on some for emergency situations and only generating a bit of maintenance gold per week?
---
DS/Ruin is raid spec. It's better for end game raids and worse for literally everything else.
---
BC in 2021? If progression slows down probably but idk
---
I PM’d you
---
Guildies will listen when I ask them to do something, like charge a little later. Also less likely to ninja.
---
If the servers are even half as unbalanced as mad Alliance players make it out to be then yes, the queue times for horde will be long because there wont be as many alliance filling the other teams.
---
Proper HighQualityGif stuff here, normally only see this sort of stuff on   /r/WallStreetbets
---
I'm a strong believer in the rule of cool. I would rather my character look cool then have min/maxed stats. 
---
I hate that every single Horde race has a hunch back. And the Undead and Orcs don't look like they are capable of complex thought. Sometimes I think about leveling a shaman, but I've never made it past the character creation screen.
---
I really want to play a Night Elf because they have the coolest mount and they do front flips when they jump. But I also wanted to play a mage. So I had to make a few sacrifices.
---
PvP.
---
Same thing, i forgot the exact patch
---
Zero risk. It's easy to bully others. For most this will mask their nonexistent skills in PVP.
---
People were getting banned for that case on vanilla so they might do it again
---
Dwarf rogues are the viet-kong though, real shit.
---
Little manlets pop out of nowhere and just shank you, no remorse, laugh over your corpse. Rinse and repeat.
---
IMO its all but guaranteed
---
Because dodging or kiting a single attack thanks to your faster move speed will save you more HP then you get from the Stam enchant.
---
I refuse to believe there is even one single player in WoW that doesn't have First Aid maxed out
---
I need video or screenshot evidence to convince me otherwise. There is just no way anyone is that bad
---
One DK is -100 RP (rank points). The progress bar on the Honor tab is just a visual representation of your RP.
---
It’s only really a big deal if you’re pushing to r13-14 because you have very little room for error once you get that high. A tiny setback can be the difference between finishing in 11 weeks or having to take 12 weeks. And when you’ve been grinding 16+ hrs/day for months, an extra week is pretty brutal.
---
90% of “normal” players who are stopping at r10 or below shouldn’t be too concerned about getting a DK.
---
Just started happening today on Mograine
---
The only reason I haven't given up on rend runs is because unless and until I get a Helm of Wrath, I still have need of a decent mail/plate FR head item from Gyth, but as far as weapons I'm content to never see Dal Rends at this point. 
---
I don't even want to know how many runs I've done for Hand of Justice. HoJ is such a damned pain because because it's actually BIS for so damned long; few people want to farm Anger, and even fewer want an extra melee in the party rolling on it. I've had two different guilds -- one very casual with failing dreams of raiding, and one moderate to hardcore that does care about my dps output -- but in both my guildies see my warrior behind as an exploitable resource to help them farm their items, but don't believe in reciprocation. And I so don't want to associate my name with the assholes spamming LFG for full reserve lists and zero melees pugging arena/anger/argel.
---
&gt; The loudest whiners are heard the most.
---
It's not whining when there's video proof of 30+ (upwards of 50) people roaming zones doing nothing but ganking.
---
Imagine getting banned for talking about something that the person you replied to brought up initially yet they go ban free.
---
Seems like prejudice to me, fam.
---
Fire does more damage but frost is better for slowing and kiting things around. If you plan on raiding you will have to go frost when you get 60 since the first two raids are bad for fire. Personally I’d go fire while leveling I think it’s more fun and you hit really hard. Traditionally a lot of people go frost though for the slowing effects and aoe grinding.
---
My friend loves bandages... After a pull when we drink he would tap to empty and bandage to full... Then I asked why he was waste bandages if we were all drinking anyway
---
YouTube video might still be up! I think It was a hunter?
---
That blizzard cared about us as customers
---
Closer to 8x the vanilla population.
---
Yeah this is my server. My subscription ran out and I'm currently debating whether to renew or not.. I've got a raid on tuesday but I don't know.. feelsbadman
---
I wasn't disagreeing, just nitpicking.
---
In software, Timezones are some of the most complicated problems to solve.
---
Still, Classic does need more support.
---
I rolled Horde this time around as well. Played Human Paladin from Beta through B.C. - and although I am loving my Elemental Shaman now, I really do miss the Alliance cities and leveling zones. Feel ya bro.
---
whats this got to do with the honor system lol
---
Felhunter basically, gives you a counterspell, a dispel for poly or ice shield, and then fear them to death.
---
ahhahaahhaahahhahahahahaha
---
Yeah I want to pvp on my 55 warrior, with my group of 52s against 60s in their epics.
---
I'm pretty sure they do.
---
Classic is the perfect opportunity for people who suck at competitive gaming to finally be the best. 
---
The only thing you're rewarded for is time invested, so the only requirement if you want to be "good" is not having a job.
---
That hardly seems worth it for some dungeons if the tank doesn't need anything.
---
game is unplayable for people not on discord with guildies, can't pug anything cause you can't communicate with anyone
---
Do warlocks not downrank like everyone else? I'm sick of warlocks I'm my dungeons slowing the party down because they need to eat or drink all the damn time, or they're pulling way too much aggro (or they need a res cuz of damn hellfire). The mages and healers don't, what makes warlocks so special, life tap? Hell no, that shit doesn't speed anything up. It's either the warlock drinking, or it's the healer. Take some responsibility.
---
I use 1 crit = 12 spell power it's not perfect and it changes as you gear up and crit becomes more important but for a general rule it works well.
---
They can 100% AoE farm.
---
oh nvm i see, about the flight path camping. yeah thats just solved with BGs so who cares atm
---
This isn’t a reply to his comment FYI
---
They still exist, no one is forcing you to play on Classic.
---
The honor system is directly responsible for the behavior because it rewards it.
---
How? I’m a lock and if we do rain of fire or hellfire we will get Agro even with VW and they will end the channeling. So please let me know. VW sacrifice works but not well enough
---
Aw look a mod got its feelings hurt. Must’ve rolled on a pvp server and now feels like I called him a fucking idiot. Welp, if the shoes fits.
---
Nah you can only solo 2 different dungeons for very solid g/hr
---
Boo hoo
---
&gt;People that justify charging with their inability to farm are just inexperienced.
---
Literally the thing I first replied to. The rest is just extra sauce on top because no one reads past the point where they get mad.
---
I know I forgot to put pvp in my original post so figured just comment it
---
Doesnt this show exactly that people WANT but CANT? Even though i feel like people exaggerate a bit, i've managed to level a rogue from 1-57 in the period phase 2 has been live.
---
Paladins have the best healing throughput in the game, challenged only by Priest. They’re arguably the most durable class, and have four lives on top of their native durability, two of which are transferable to another player. They’re the best class in the game in small group PvP and the best class by miles in large-scale, organized PvP, and it’s not close.
---
I usually have to tell the locks I run with that they can tap, it's fine. It's the hunters that scare me. Appearing to go from 100% to dead with feign death still spooks me.
---
No no no Im waiting for you to tell me what you use castbar addons for. If its not helping you in PVP, why do you use it. Its a really simple question that we both know you cant answer.
---
I mean it's not that weird. I've been playing with the same people now for 3 months, we connect. Sure it was random people joining the guild but they aren't random people anymore.
---
There's also the added bonus of the people that I tank for will return the favor when I need my priest / rogue geared up. I've also noticed in guild runs people are actually playing the game. Half the time that I pug it's pretty obvious that the 4 I am with are watching Netflix / playing with their cat more than actually doing anything in the group.
---
This post post is obviously fake no lock would ever take mana efficiency over damage.
---
Ah yes that is true.
---
Haha seems right, i truly thought I discovered something secret
---
It’s /equipslot 13
---
there is no space between equip and slot
---
If the horde pop increased on heartseeker, i would finish leveling my 55 priest. 
---
Worthy of a good montage
---
Set hearth to Darnassus, there are a lot of lower level mages who will be happy to port back for free because they’re rarely asked to do it. I get tips all day on my 40 mage porting from darn to IF and bonus, if you spend five minutes in darn you zone in unflagged and the rogues can’t get you. Not ideal, but much faster and less frustrating.
---
This was about AoE, not soloing
---
I'm quite happy on my PVP server. Classic has nothing on EVE when it comes to tryhard PVP and play denial tactics.
---
Try again.
---
What are you on about with this negative FR shit, lmao? MC is easy because people know to use greater fire protection pots (amongst other consumables) and equip the correct gear/talents to do amazing DPS. MC was always easy as shit, we cleared it just fine in original vanilla as well.
---
Horde racials aren’t that much better, if at all, and paladins are so good that Alliance is CLEARLY far better in PvE and quite a bit better in arranged PvP. People roll Horde because they like the faction.
---
Well I’m not the one that picked a pvp server. Sorry for trying to help you out and give you money making suggestions.
---
Wotf is super op in pvp
---
For The Horde!
---
&gt; Mine is based on Blizzard announcing that medium servers are gonna be way bigger than even the fullest vanilla servers. And that's MEDIUM.
---
That's not direct evidence for 10k or 15k or 20k server caps, nobody's found a statement by someone from blizzard or a different reliable source of concurrent players to show those kinds of numbers. As far as I can tell, you're just guessing as to what the concurrent player cap is and so is everyone else.
---
&gt; You've already been proven wrong.
---
I have only been proven wrong by census addons that Blizzard said themselves that they broke shortly after launch.
---
EDIT: Found it finally, here's Hazzikostas on the issue:
---
&gt; Hazzikostas: Each layer is effectively going to be what a healthy server was at launch in 2004 in terms of the number of people it holds.
---

---
This was awesome! ty!
---
I see Dumb &amp; Dumber. I upvote.
---
This is the type of thing someone who never played Vanilla would say.
---
Well, with my lvl 50 lock, if I'm going to do good damage I'm pretty much going to go OOM every pull. (I don't know if that's the case for 60s with better optimized gear.) But at my level, I haven't seen any other classes whose mana pool is so inefficient that they'd have to drink between every pull. So when I lifetap between pulls, I'm doing it so I don't slow my group down.
---
Having said that, I do have first aid, and I do try to keep a stack of food on me. Also, I usually remind healers that they don't need to keep me topped up all the time: I'll heal myself slowly by various means like Drain Life/Siphon Life, and being low health a lot of the time is perfectly fine as long as I'm managing threat well enough. 
---
Do healers listen to me though? Hardly ever. Most of them keep me topped up all the time, getting me right in the middle of channeling bandage, and then having to drink every few pulls themselves. \*shrug\*
---
So for making money off alchemy while leveling, what is it that generally sells?
---
P2 shoudlve included BG's imo. but ppl wouldve went nuts over screwing wpvp over (even tho honor without bgs was only for 6 weeks in vanilla) and this phase was good for building rivalries anyways.
---
Then quit acting like a bitch and getting your feelings hurt.
---
I was able to do tribute runs in 100% pve spec.  It only really blew one of my runs where I had fd resist twice in a row. only did about 12 runs tho to get 2x ring 1x weapon
---
PVP he said
---
You're right, succ is life for drain tank.
---
That's pretty reasonable though
---
No, you're not and no thats false. The maths have already been done 1000 times, dalrends are 100% better with 2x agi enchant.
---
Nope, he was “deep holy” per his own words and Details showed he had Holy Nova.
---
Why not just get trinketmenu
---
Oh look, another overgrown baby that should have rolled on a PvE server
---
You clearly don’t yourself. Making use of pathing and terrain isn’t an exploit.
---
Yep when a rogue blows his load on the one caster I don’t have a ton of agro on I let him have it. He asked for it
---
Game is literally un fucking playable. How am I paying for this.
---
I was a healer watching our lock dot ranged pulls right after the tank shot them that kept blaming the tank for not being able to hold aggro. Don't have to worry about that problem again because notes addon is best addon.
---
You don’t disagree with me. I said should
---
&gt;and from my experience alliance usually just seems way more passive when it comes to PvP in general
---
Ashbringer EU - 15 - 20 Alliance camping Undercity lifts meanwhile everybody inside spamming lfg in trade. There were around 45 lvl 60 in UC that night and more lvl 55+ and none of them moved their little finger to do something about it.
---
And it feels kinda the same everywhere I go so... dunno :)
---
Spirit is an S Tier leveling stat for warlocks. But if this was at 55-60 the lock was an idiot
---
Sure but it wasn’t at nearly the same level as it is now. 10-20 people as opposed to what feels like 200 all trying to grind for rank 14 the day of release
---
Edit: I guess the difference is people have figured out 4-7 man death squads is the best way to do it, so there’s groups EVERYWHERE. When it was released I think most people were grinding south shore/TM before moving to BRM groups.
---
I was able to quest  just fine between honor being released and BG’s coming out in vanilla. Again sure I was ganked more, but the game didn’t feel unplayable
---
It's funny then how I used my pet to pull mobs from deeper water so I wouldn't have to. It must've stayed underwater for over an hour that session.
---
Yeah no reason to use a wand otherwise.  I would use life tap + drain life before I use a wand.
---
Oh you actually have the aforementioned delicate sensibility that you were trying to trigger people with
---
it took a little bit of time. but i had the idea a few days ago and everytime i thought about it i couldnt stop laughing. was hoping others would feel the same lol.
---
The higher you are the worse it is, though almost no one here would know what that was like
---
Spirit is S Tier leveling stat for warlocks.
---
Uh, no. Blizzard have ALL the power here. It's their game. They should have capped the faction population at the start, and now that the issue is unsolvable, they should cap logins based on faction.
---
It's actually kinda interesting that even the low pop ganking servers are showing the same symptoms isn't it ?
---
It's almost like the failure cascade is linked to relative numbers, not density.
---
This phase made me lose faith in humanity a little bit.
---
Not really, my understanding is that a bunch of us selfless folks want to help others so we can get further in what ever is our goal. Doesn't matter what class you are we are all in this together. Wow in my mind has it's upsides and downsides depending on your class, complaining about one thing or another is dumb. Warriors get instant groups while i have to wait hours etc. The logic of the people replying to me is astonishing esp when it's very obvious they have no idea what they are talking about.
---
*cries in Orc Warlock*
---
Who would have thought that Europeans would be more fast and loose with the censorship than Americans.
---
It’s not an opinion. Spirit is mathematically excellent and superior to every stat except spell power for warlocks while leveling.
---
Cause the AH prices heavily inflate my gph (making it inaccurate) and I really only farm vendortrash so that's pretty bad for me
---
This is why I always ask locks if they want me healing them at the beginning of the run.
---
I think you seem dis-loyal in general. Not just with this guild.
---
Any I'm not to bothered as long as its eu and english
---
You have no idea what you're talking about, in what scenario would a warlock ever downrank? that makes no sense.
---
Also, one cast from a healer to bring a warlock to full HP is a very small fraction of their mana, and since warlocks can convert their HP into a full mana bar its WAY more efficient for a healer to just toss a heal then to expect a warlock to drink every single time hes oom from casting shadowbolts. 
---
It is not "either warlock drinking or healer" it's an incredibly unequal comparison. You clearly haven't played a warlock.
---
Unless you are an engineer, carrot on a stick is 95% of people’s first available one they can attain.
---
You can't know that from the information available in this post. OP didn't say "my GM isn't recruiting more Hunters, should I leave?"
---
Hmm hadn't thought of that to be fair guess /played makes it more fair
---
The easiest way to fix this issue is to start a petition for J. Allen Brack to resign and keep pushing it until they fix it.
---
You clearly haven't played with one.
---
They should drop the next phase early.
---
maybe trying to make ppl get off the megaservers lol
---
So....depending on the level range, we actually do if we're spaced Imp Drain Soul. That skills is basically our Spirit Tap. The problem is, it's only worthwhile IF we stack spirit. 
---
That being said, there's a variety of sources of random spirit and it's still a drastically better skill for healers, and given that healers are far more in demand, I'll generally pass good spirit gear to the healers if they want it and just pick up some AH greens or crafted gear rather than deny my healer the sweet spirit gear.
---
Reminds me of the old relationship advice:
---
Be thankful that your fiancee cheated on you. She did it before she legally could take you to the cleaners.
---
Locks love dotting everything (because it's great DPS) and that eats mana.   
---
No, DPS typically do not typically downrank in dungeons. Not sure where you get that idea :p
---
Anyway an affliction lock can do that whole thing and then use Drain Life after Life Tap. It's just most don't.
---
Resto Druids in my guild have more epics than me (Feral, class leader) in my guild. 
---
Does that mean my time isn't valued? No, it just means we treat everyone fairly instead of play favorites. I could very well take all of the Cenarion pieces for myself for PvP and tell the Resto Druids to fuck off, but I think that creates a toxic environment and hurts the guild in the long run.
---
So you're useful in raids
---
Thrall from Warcraft 3 inspired me to choose Horde when I started playing World of Warcraft. Whatever went down, I wanted to be on his side! Never looked back, never regretted it for a second. Lok'tar Ogar!
---
Yeah, I think your solutions sounds really interesting. Because its like a faction queue, but it doesn't instantly kill unbalanced servers.
---
Because I know faction queue has been tried on some TBC private servers to force people to play alliance, and it was a disaster where horde would sit in queue literally all day, and were completly unable to play (leading to either the death of the servers, or until the system was scrapped entirely).
---
Your proposal at least lets people play on their characters, while essentially doing the same thing.
---
You should post your idea on the official forums or on a new reddit post.
---
sounds like an awful raid
---
Yes. Because it makes you stronger *for*the raids.
---
Which server did you level your alliance character to 60 on?
---
Maybe launch with more than 2 servers next time so communities don't majorly form on only those?
---
And how does this address the fact that they've cut like half their support staff right before launching a new product?
---
If you don't like it don't pay for it.
---
For raiding Ban'thok is better. You can pick up extra spell power on almost every item slot but spell hit is only attainable on like 4 item slots currently, neck, belt, chest and maybe 1 other I'm forgetting at the moment. When bloodvine gear comes out then the sash or Mana igniting cord will be better hands down but till then thanks to the lack of availability of spell hit gear Ban'thok is better.
---
Just remember 20 extra spell power is great, not wiping the raid because you had 3 banishes resisted in a row is usually better.
---
This message brought to you be Melee Gang
---
This is primarily a population and balance issue.
---
Yep I meant skinning. Thanks for the info! 
---
Are hides valuable or also trash?
---
I can easily answer that. In two parts, it makes it easier to see what someone is casting, and two mine is built in as part of a larger ui mod.
---
I mean I literally can’t even turn in or pick up dungeon quests anywhere in burning steppes. Like, my guy can’t read the quest fast enough before I die from the hundreds of horde camping there. This game is literally unplayable right now. What the fuck is blizzard thinking not doing a damn thing? And why the fuck did everyone chose to be a douchebag horde? And how are there that many people that have no fucking life whatsoever and are already top tier gear wise and just camping all day? Doesn’t anybody have to work or have a family that plays this game?
---
I feel that it adds to the experience.
---
Off topic but is there a way to hide the phase overlays on atlasloot item icons
---
What server? I'm currently leveling a 51 paladin and a 48 warrior on Kritonos and would love to join a PvP guild fighting the good fight.
---
Getting gear in raids takes a long ass time. Getting the best gear before raid gear allows you to be optimal in your performance until those pieces are finally replaced.
---
I wanted to play shaman, and Barrens chat is never boring. When I played alliance it seemed a lot less social.
---
You literally can't reach the top brackets if you just do open world PvP. That prevents you from getting the rewards.
---
You need to do battlegrounds to compete.
---
LOLLLL I've been maining a 60 warlock... you are a warrior. nice "no u" comeback though, real effective.
---
Yeah ofc, he lost the roll so he gets annoyed - anyone would get annoyed when they don't win something they desire, but that doesn't mean everyone who losses automatically believe that rolling is a dumb way to hand out loot.
---
That's why i said it's up to him to decide - Does he find it fair or unfair?
---
Incorrect. They do. Some are just lazy. May take longer and be ineffective but they do have ways. It also comes down to the people you group with and the type of 'friends' you have.
---
It just means the best gear that is obtainable outside of raids, basically gear from 5 mans, professions and questchains.
---
Its absolutely not a requirement to do raids however, just collect a few pieces and then go raid. Gearing isn't as fast anyways, and MC/Ony aren't difficult raids, so just get something and then keep working on it while you are a raider.
---
I still have a rabbit's paw in my bags.
---
The hyperbole is strong with this one...
---
Feel like this could potentially lead to some upset group members. People do bail on groups with tanks btw.
---
I understand the game is completely broken rn and pretty much agree with you but what’s the big deal with someone killing you once on a rooftop compared to someone corpse camping you? 
---
They kill you once then you spawn away from the rooftop... problem solved. Lot better then them big braining it and following you around.
---
Reserving is a despicable habit. The guild is doing the right thing.
---
Getting raid gear can take a very long time.
---
Am I reading it incorrectly or is that a 12 hour raid?
---
Not everyone who participates in the pvp is aiming for the top brackets. There WILL still be people ganking and farming zones in the open world, there just won't be as many doing it since BGs will be a vastly better option if you're looking for the most honor per hour.
---
Not only that but the encounters are in their post-nerf state. It's not so much about class buffs as it is the fact that we're playing in the equivalent of what conceptually became the end-of-lifecycle content tourism patches we now have on retail.
---
you really think only 2 servers have communities formed? i think you megaserver peeps have your heads up your ass. just transfer off.
---
They're all rezzing at the same time. We knew where they were going to appear because there was a high density of pvp-flagged players in that spot.
---
Looks like it’s time to roll a mage alt
---
Except for server population.
---
I like it, i pay for it, my account got hacked, still paying for it and no account yet. What do you suggest here? Just stop playing the game I like and put a lot of time into, and create another account, because the services I pay for can not solve problems correctly or efficiently ?
---
But it's the priest's main stat, hence much much more useful to the priest than to the lock......
---
low level npc's only. if you hover over them it will say in a bright green "Civilian" - these give dhk's.
---
Guys stop talking shit of the game the dude plays , you don't want to be the ones triggering the next school shooting
---
As a healer I blame myself first while understanding tanks cannot control their suicidal tendencies. (I tanked for years)  
---
I generally give healers benefit of the doubt but you may have had a bad healer... odd :)
---
So.... pug players are garbage? Interesting philosophy there. Glad I don't pug with your guild.
---
And then he rolled 100 on Teebos longsword, and they all went farming for rabbits for the next 2 days
---
Ad hoc fallacy is working well for you.
---
Okay cool. So I can only do molten cord and Ony once a week?
---
41 tidal charm, farmed it afk while working
---
Healer mana is a resource that cuts down on time and earns you more money. A healer without mana means the group cant pull and slows everything down. A healer with no mana means a wipe, more time wasted and repair bill costs.
---
This is the same reason going insane on dps and being a squishy dps char tanking damage is slowing down the group. A healer dumping all of their mana into a player with no damage mitigation is gonna burn mana faster. Just let the tank hold aggro, the run will go quicker via chain pulling.
---
Irony, cause this is cope lmao
---
Why isn't [Flarecore Leggings](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19165/flarecore-leggings) mentioned anywhere for caster dps gearing? Is it due to the material cost being relatively high? Am I wrong to consider this to be useful once the pattern becomes available with phase 3? It has more spell power than Skyshroud Leggings and T1/T2 pants.
---
Yes, you ARE a warlock. You have no idea how the tanks and healers feel about your bullshit.
---
Dal Rends: 50 RAP, 1% crit, 7 def, 4 str, 100 armor
---
2x BSH: 26 agi, 10 stam.
---
The agility turns into 52 RAP, .49% crit, .98% dodge, and 52 armor.
---
You lose a bit of crit and gain a bit of AP, but the stam is more beneficial than the armor or defense.
---
The agi also scales better with kings
---
Edit: the point is moot as the enchant in question isn't even out. BiS lists that contain Dal Rends are misleading a lot of people. Until that point, you're better of getting Barbarous Blade and going into Molten Core and getting Brutality Blade/CHT instead of walking around with Dal Rends waiting for phase 3 like some kind of stupendous fool.
---
I’d echo other users in that the majority of the valid criticism of Classic right now is the situation in PvP realms. The realms are almost all over populated, and it makes the casual experience very unrewarding. I won’t waste your time with a wall explaining why Phase 2 is (and the time period it represents from actual Vanilla) is actually toxic for casuals, but it kind of is horrible unless you are a 1%’er. If you just have a few hours every day or so, maybe a bit longer on the weekends or something, be warned. 
---
That being said, PvE realms will obviously have access to BGs, are generally a little lower pop, and allow casual players who make it to lvl 48+ to safely enjoy the open world content. And you can still find plenty of PvP in BGs and in the open world even. Best of both worlds for a casual. 
---
In general, there is a reason this game is 15 years old, the Devs openly refused to rerelease it, and were swamped by public outcry for Classic to happen - it’s a really fun game. The servers melted on launch day (and month arguably) because it’s a really damn good MMO. I’ve certainly found myself wishing I had more time to play than more to do with my playtime, which is exactly the opposite of retail for the last 5+ years.
---
I’m not sure if this is actually a bug. There is absolute evidence that Hunters should not Burn mana in our bear/cat form and that has been fixed, but everything else seems to still burn me. It may be intended though, I haven’t seen any evidence aside from viper sting not burning us
---
Edit: Does priests mana burn work if you are already shifted and they do it?
---
Because why invite someone with bad gear when you can invite someone with better gear who will pull their weight?
---
If each layer held a healthy 2004 server population size, and the layers were removed... then that means all those players are now on one layer. Dunno how that's hard to understand.
---
You just said in your replies that you run for gear and run for guildies.  When have you ran for neither, ran an instance (not lost rolls) but actually ran an instance where you have nothing to get, with the intent of just helping out random people who you don't even know.  I can almost bet that it's well under 5 times in your lifetime of ALL MMOs, that you fully knew there was nothing in the instance you needed and you joined a group of people you never met before just to help them gear up.
---
Yeah I was thinking about this. What does the human sword spec get me? like 3% hit? That seems valuable dmg wise, especially while grinding. You are right about the top end dmg, but I'm not sure it outweighs the hit.
---
&gt;DPS typically do not typically downrank in dungeons.
---
Then you'll be spending most of the dungeon on your ass drinking, it's not effective at all.
---
omg as a kid I got stuck right at the start of Ocarina of Time because I couldn’t figure out how to get the Kokiri Sword. I crawled through the tunnel once and got hit by the boulder. After that I got scared and convinced myself I wasn’t supposed to be in that area yet. Can’t remember how long it took to me to go back in and figure it out.
---
&gt;*We want the original game design but with modern fixes. We want faction ques. We want balanced racials. We dont want class homogenization but we do want some classes fucking nerfed because theyre broken (Spriests, locks, mages, rogues). We want diminishing returns on roots. We want balanced guard distribution.*
---
Sounds like you want a different game...
---
Dungeons are the only way for an enhancement shaman to gear for PvP in certain slots because(for the same reasons you gave) raids aren't giving them dps gear.
---
And while ret or enhancement are garbage in raids, they are decent for PvP.
---
If I'm running with guildies, I have a lot more patience. Mainly because I depend on them to raid.
---
Deathbone gear is servicable tank gear, allowing for more tanks to tank these dungeons for the pre bis too. That great was trash in earlier patches
---
This macro is pointless without Anger Management right? Other than getting you to the mob faster.. as soon as you switch stance you dump to 0 rage

20 whole golden pieces an hour while doing nothing but essentially plating an uninteractive cell phone game from 2006
---
You can clear it once a week (kill all the bosses) yes. And then the raids resets every tuesday (I think NA) and wednesday EU
---
But every raid boss only drops like max 4 items, usually 2-3. So it will take you a long while to get the best gear obtainable.
---
ive played both sides over the years (and a ton in vanilla)
---
shamans are better for everything unless your sole goal is PVE raid healing
---
far more dmg, utility, and fun
---
ret is objectively horrendous compared to either shaman dps spec and prot is a meme spec as well
---
a lot of what a paladin can do that is actually good in pvp can also simply be spam purged by priests and shamans
---
also priests can be Spriest if they want, objectively the 2nd best pvp class in the game right behind locks
---
I don’t mind usually because it gives me something to do. But if I’m stopping to drink because a pull was big and you fucking life tap down to 10% health and then afk while I finish drinking I’m going to say something. I usually have extra water and give it to the lock and say “drink when I’m drinking, idc if you life tap in between but I’m not drinking multiple times to offset your laziness”
---
If I have to stop dpsing to bandage myself because a healer doesn’t want to heal and would rather stand there with full mana wanding, that’s an issue.  My warlock averages 250-300 dps single target in 5 mans, and 2-3x that for aoe packs.
---
Since you’re talking about putting a cost on heals, let’s break this down. 
---
2600 hp is 1-2 heals at max level, so 700-1400 mana if you’re using a max rank heal with +0 healing.  
---
A Heavy Runecloth Bandage costs me 12s and 6 seconds of downtime for 2000 hp, so I’ll need to spend more downtime eating or if I’m in combat using drain life for any remainder. If we’re talking out of combat I need 2 food to recover that same amount, taking ~35 seconds  to recover what would take you less than 6 to replenish.
---
A single lvl 45 water costs 7s20c (assuming honored with faction vendor), less if you’re getting lvl 55 water from a mage (which you should do before dungeoning anyway), and less downtime recovering that mana drinking that varies based on your spirit/mp5.
---
Why is your 3-6 (&lt;7s20c) seconds worth more than my 6-9 seconds (19s20c/14s40c)? 
---
TL:DR You’re the healer. Heal the warlock who is helping you clear the dungeon. Your time isn’t worth any more than theirs.
---
And what i am doing is running them for nothing because no one will ever pay a rogue o.O
---
Got the nifty stopwatch in badlands around 34-35 IIRC.

---
The conversation was about tapping out of combat. You had to try really hard to make your point about being in combat and with a full Mana healer. Yeah that sounds super common.
---
&gt; A healer with normal gear can top off a warlock from 0 to 90% Hp with one healing spell that costs no more then 7% of his mana.
---
Unless you're a paladin, in which case it's more like 15-20% of your mana for a holy light, and I won't have Divine Favor every time you tap to 0 hp. It's more preferable to life tap every now and then instead of spamming it to go from empty mana to full mana. Pallies hate having to do big heals.
---
I have no issues with locks life tapping, but if you're just tapping to full mana and not bothering to bandage/eat, then I won't bother to heal you.
---
You realize that someone can defend an edgy joke without literally supporting the concept.
---
This has nothing to do with lack of tanks.
---
&gt;A complete shot in a the dark here, but maybe just limit enemy player information until your character can see them or your character has been targeted by an enemy? Again, I’m just spit balling here, I’m sure that’s a radical idea.
---
Sooo pretty much like it is now? Spy can't even detect buffs anymore unless they cast it again within the shortened range.
---
I'm still a firm believer in permitting no add-ons then seeing how truly good everyone is.
---
Seems chat server has been restarted on Shazzrah EU, everything fine now :)
---
The bluepost is right, at the time it was made (Aug 16). Back there, servers had ~5 layers each, every layer with a capacity roughly to 3k concurrent online players. They have even increased the layers number later.
---
"Each layer is effectively going to be what a healthy server was at launch in 2004 in terms of the number of people it holds."
---
However, right now every realm has 1 layer, while its size increased only slightly, around 6k cap which is filled only at couple of servers I have mentioned.
---
Had a ret pally  win briarwood reed I’ve been trying to help guildie get. He already had HoJ and blackhands... not as bad as this but still lol
---
In some scenarios a lot of that gear is BIS including raid gear. Depending what class and spec you have you should look up what your pre BIS and raid bis gear is. A feral druid tank for example only gets about 3-5 upgrades from raids. (Neck, cape, ring, belt, shoulders) the belt and shoulders are fire resist so that is also situational.
---
You were kinda an ass the way you said your first comment (that was heavily downvoted) but i dont disagree with this comment.
---
It's up to the community to improve it though.
---
It doesn't function very well on spread out fights like ragnaros
---
Do you have evidence to your claim, preferably with links?
---
Got to do it at off hours or with a group to keep PvP at bay. It isn't easy in either case.
---
Oof
---
Don't worry, if Blizzard finds that HS is the culprit you can rest assured that Blizzard will break functionality swiftly and with ease and then this will become a non-issue very rapidly. They've said that they're investigating the cause of the issue, so there will be a fix soon.
---
Which is weird, considering we have more players than NA on both classic and retail.
---
Or you know drink/eat same time as the healer does
---
What about elevensies?
---
I'm confused on what people expect blizzard to do? They said no changes, so no.
---
Secondly I'm confused on what you expect blizzard to do about faction imbalances. The absolute only way to 'fix' faction imbalance is basically start faction locking servers till other people join that specific server on the imbalanced faction, no one is going to do that.
---
You want a balanced server? Find what the faction % before joining said server.
---
1. Warriors deserve money from runs because they have higher repair costs, they don’t get any gear upgrades from the dungeon and therefore have no reason to do it for anything other than gold, and because they’re scarce. There is no pity argument here. 
---
2. Warriors are doing a service. Without them, DPS could never get gear. 
---
3. “I don’t need to run this dungeon because I’ve already pulled all the upgrades from this dungeon, why would I run this with you if not for gold? Find a tank who isn’t geared yet or pay me.”
---
There's no evidence to assume that Blizz increased the concurrent player cap, unless you have the link hidden somewhere?
---
This is just ridiculously wrong. You have to manage your mana as DPS, yes, but there's no need to downrank your spells, especially since almost every spell in the game becomes more efficient at higher levels.
---
Healers should downrank SOMETIMES and that's about it.
---
Why not? If it violates the terms of service that's one thing, but a tasteless name is just that. Somebody named "niggersrdumm" is probably going to have a hard enough time getting groups that it's more of a boon for them to change their names.
---
“Best” pvp spec is either arcane/fire or frost/fire.  I’d suggest frost/arcane for leveling and raid, then respec
---
Lock tanking is a fun build all jokes aside.
---
I think it will still be significantly worse than phase 1, simply because there is \*an incentive\* to kill people now, unlike in phase 1. The fact that BGs are more efficient for honor will lessen the problem but it won't solve it.
---
Warrior has ez mode after 60 with either instant 5 man group or an ability to reserve gear there + every raid needs warrior.
---
Good luck getting a raid spot in a guild as feral dps in current classic.
---
Allies?  If your on a trash server like Blaumeux its the horde who wont get attuned.
---
I don't think this was a thing in Vanilla.  DestroyTotem is a secure function, so it's interesting how you work around it, and this form of attribute setting I think was introduced in 2.0.
---
Horde are mean.
---
Super weird indeed
---
The idea of not using bandages as a lock is one of the strangest things I have ever heard - bandages are a must! And most ??? What kind of warlocks are you playing with? Yikes
---
Hit is better than crit until cap! You actually don’t get full value from +1% crit until you are at hit cap so it’s best to go hit over crit first.
---
What's the "best" way to grind for the Dreadsteed quest chain?

---
Do you have proof of the concurrent player cap being increased in any way besides reddit posts? Maybe some evidence through links?
---
Casual players don't spend much more than 12 hours a week playing WoW (and that would be considered a lot in any other game or activity outside WoW). It's roughly 4 months just to go from 1 to 60. Is it that crazy to think that they would rather quit than start over? Open transfers already.
---
\&gt;implying shadowlands will be bad
---
\&gt;implying SLs will have to compete with classic (like they are competing now lol)
---
tin foil hats is all i read
---
I disagree. I had like only 2-3 bad experiences from skill in total while gathering my full preraid bis. 
---
When talking to people they are bad and have no idea what is really going on, but for the content we are doing now it is good enough.
---
As a fury prot tank that is essentially another DPS but beefy if people paid me I might want to go again... lol
---
Don't really need blues anymore
---
Yeah, but its a bit too late for that.
---
If Blizzard would have shown the faction ratios on launch on all the PvP servers, I am pretty sure the server would have been better balanced now.
---
Ofcourse some people quit, but 30/70 is pathetic.
---
I don't even have any idea if the census addons are accurate either, as all the sites show different stats.
---
You literally said you lost on truestrike shoulders the other day, that is you running an instance for gear, for a reason.
---
Yup I’ve killed all of you multiple times
---
Repeatedly leaving stealth to try to mount when he could’ve walked there far far faster, and then attacking people 5+ levels below you who are just trying to get to the instance. What’s the complaint here? Rogue clearly out to PVP, gets PVP’d.
---
Very dank. Good work.
---
nah
---
faction balance would only enhance the current experience 
---
ppl that think classic is the broken experience are stupid
---
classic is the experience where you have a large population on one server and you play amongst those ppl as you progress your character in a more traditional MMO styled game
---
retail is just a vague rpg where you run on a hamster wheel each week
---
totally different games
---
a fixed classic is still a million miles away from retail 
---
stop and think... would giving alliance the same guard protection as horde really make the game like retail? lmao
---
I managed to do it a week after phase 2 started np. Do it offhours, like really early/late (pref not weekends). You will manage it.. like all the other hunters.
---
we need to get DKs removed
---
Nobody can even see what it is
---
i'll probably quit if bg queues are too long
---
Actually Blizzard indeed increased the amount of players per layer, around 6k now.
---
Nice that it worked out for you, i am trying for over 2 weeks now with still 0/4 demons :(
---
I think he means that the guild leader is willing to RES items that he wants, but unwilling to make that consideration for others. That is what makes him skummy without any comment on the morality of reserving items.
---
Becuz who wants to play a human? I play one everyday in real life...
---
Oh no, spending resources on fixing a game that you obviously mismanaged?!
---
Downvoted for Undead rogue, upvoted for funny video and good gameplay!
---
&gt; We are fairly sure — we can't know for sure without being fortune tellers, but most of them align — there will be a fairly steep drop off compared to that day one interest, and we want to make sure because of how important community is in Classic in particular, that we have healthy server populations. 
---
Except people have quit, a lot of it. And we have 1 layer with " healthy vanilla server population" now.
---
One of the mages parachutes runs out LUL
---
Reserving items only for himself, and for offspec even, but not doing it for others who need substantial upgrades is definitely scummy and selfish.
---
eye of rend, i was running a guildy thru for attunement, it dropped and i was curious how it would effect my dps, i didn't need it.
---
I mean no, everything about this is anecdotal. The only proof both of us have to go on is the few things Blizz have said and the plethora of reddit complaints.
---
It is still a pain, but I recently found out that doesn't actually remove the stuff from the chat log, it just moves it further up for no apparent reason. If you scroll up you'll see stuff out of order with the timestamps.

Weren't you guys working on revising it a few weeks ago too? Either allow it or don't, or create a sub-subreddit specifically for memes like /r/FFBraveExvius did, /r/FFMemeExvius, you could do /r/classicwowmemes or something.
---
Sure it’s against tos, but no ones ever gotten banned for it. At least not on record.
---
why would a dps ever downrank besides certain pvp situations or niche stuff in raids? 
---
locks are oom all the damn time because the pre-bis lists that everyone follows are pure glass cannon builds with little to no focus on increasing mana, combine this with bad warlock and healer playstyles that dont mix together and you get what you see in most groups
---
bad warlocks tap too much and without any insight of healer / group mana, and bad healers constantly overheal the warlock that is tapping - this makes the healer oom all the damn time
---
it really is annoying as a warlock that whenever i tap a few times and then start to bandage myself only to get healed to full and seeing the healer's mana go to 0% while i am now 100%/100%. same with eating/drinking, warlocks like to minmax the time it takes to eat and drink to full by tapping a few times and then eat and drink at the same time. imagine wasting precious food only to be healed to full, while your healer now has to drink for two.
---
anyhow, the warlock should tap a few times to last a new pull if the group (especially the healer) has more mana than him, this way the group can keep going for another pull. the healer should HoT the warlock and/or tank and then start drinking right before the pull starts, giving him enough mana to last the pull
---
if the healer / group needs a drink then the warlock should obviously do the same, but don't heal me to full prior to drinking just because i tapped 
---
when both the healer and warlock are good, similarly geared and on the same page, both need to drink less because they synergize really well. 
---
man i could write a book about the healer / warlock synergy (or lack of in most cases)
---
Yes. Because if you try to do a raid as a fresh 60, most of your gear will still be from 30-59. Gear that is packed with raw stats but doesn't have any hit or crit. Getting *at least* your hit chance to 6 to 9% means you won't be wasting resources on abilities that miss and do no damage.
---
It takes a long time to get a full set of raid gear and the concept of Pre-Raid BIS is to have a good output while you're still farming for raid pieces, instead of doing shit DPS/tanking/healing for weeks before you start getting better pieces.
---
YOU’VE FOUND THE POINT!!! CONGRATULATIONS!
---
Tanks DON’T run dungeons after they’ve got the gear from it! That’s why they charge people to go back and run it with people who DON’T have their gear from it yet! They charge AND get paid because they’re scarce and gear quickly, and people don’t want to wait a long time to find a tank!
---
...but if you want to actually earn those incentives, you can't kill people in the open world in organized groups. Only incidentally / between battlegrounds.
---
Dps should take care of themselves, heals are luxury unless it's some fight where damage is unavoidable (protect mage for aoe etc). Healer is not there to correct others' stupidity or lazyness.
---
Renew when there is mana for it, of course.
---
Any alliance players that want some fun make a level 1 horde character and get summoned to thorium point then run into BRM on it, I had less deaths on that level 1 than on my level 60 doing the run.
---
They have slightly less than 2x cap than vanilla servers back then. Which is nothing special.
---
I am always trying it off hours for over 2 weeks now, still 0/4 but i'll keep trying i guess.
---
I died.
---
Pretty much this lol.  For 5 man content people are always looking for tanks.  Dps are a dime a dozen.
---
Brother played alliance, so I followed. As it kid, it also felt like a good side (alliance) and bad side (horde); where I wanted to play the good guys.
---
I'm not. I've played Horde in Vanilla, Alliance in TBC, Horde from LK to WoD and Alliance Legion+. If there's one thing I've learned over these years is that 95% of players are terrible at the game and 100% of faction-proud players are absolutely terrible at the game.
---
Yup. No addons would make sense, specifically within classic. Too late for that though.
---
Nah you never needed it. People just used it because it made them die less, which was a product of everyone sucking at the game.
---
There's been private servers where gear had the original early patch stats while MC was overtuned as hell compared to Classic and the content still rolled over without anyone except tanks using any Fire res.
---
or you could just figure out how to play your class yourself instead of looking for an addon that turns the game into whack-a-mole...
---
Yeah, Felhunter's nice if you're questing in PvP zones, with stealth detection + silence + purge. Most Horde have a way to remove the succ kiss, so it's not nearly as useful for PvP. Fel is also a bit tankier than the succ if you're using Tainted Blood

---
&gt;Except for the fact that this server is almost 4x the size of the largest vanilla servers back in the day.
---
gonna need a big fat source for that. and also for the record by the looks of things now even with alliance babies threatening to quit, the overall population distribution amongst all combined servers is negligibly horde favored. so BG queue times will likely not be an issue.  https://imgur.com/GQ7VUVa

Not me, but all the hunters in my guild have been able to complete it. It's one of the hardest quests imo.

---
I agree that the 2190 hours in 3 months is enough to get to 60 easily. Some of us have work, school, significant others, kids, and friends who don't play WoW that mean we weren't quite able to play every waking minute of those 3 months.
---
That's.... that's literally wow pvp in a nutshell....the only time you'll get a fair fight in the game is in a duel .lol imagine expecting the other faction to wait for you to kill the mob wait for cds and mana before engaging you...
---
I play tank, but I totally get the frustration for healers, however, some healers can spare the mana. I keep an eye on healer mana so I know when I can pull. Im also fairly geared, so unless I pull something like an entire hallway in BRD, their mana will not move a whole lot, especially if they arent chucking random DPS stuff with their free time/mana. If youre running 80-100% mana most of the time, chuck the lock a quick HoT to help him out and also to make the tank feel more comfortable pulling--since that lock is 90% of the time going to dump AoE one second before my arrow lands on the pack. (But if the lock is the type to tap to 5%HP or youre a pally healer, screw him for being too aggressive or not adjusting to the group comp.)

Drain tank is a good leveling build, and if you're already specced into affliction then there's literally no reason not to get it. It's free mana

hey man, when i first started my first character was a night elf druid that i walked all the way to ironforge because someone told me that's where all the alliance players go. i was like 11 years old. i finally got there, fell in the trench, couldn't find the ramp out, and deleted the character. that's why i play horde to this day.

Every guild needs one. My guild slowly died and I literally accepted a guild invitation yesterday and went on their MC run and won my aged corehound leather gloves. Our offtank is a bear and he's a fuckin beast.

Point is there's not huge demand as you say but there's also not huge supply. All those rogues and dps warriors were thrilled to have a cat in their group for the 3%crit.

When I'm running with a tank other than MrPantzen, I've gotten in the habit of /w them before we get started to say, "If you're down 2k health and I have at least 30% mana, don't panic. I'm trying to leave room for a crit. But, I'm not going to let you die."
---
Do you have to die in an instance to get rezzed when walking in?
---
In other words, if I die the second I land could I just go the rest of the way to BRD or molten core as a ghost?

Look man the games a joke if shaman tanking actually adds an element of challenge and they enjoy it, let them. Raiding in classic is ez pz easiest raids in all of wow let them spice it up

So you were helping a friend, it's the same as running for a reason.  We have went over this multiple times, if you can't understand why tanks doing this is actually helping and not hurting the game I just can't seem to get through to you.  You are just a lost cause I guess.

Thank you for beating me to it, dude left out pvp vs pve - of course if you include the fucking massively imbalanced pve servers where it's basically 90:10 alliance it skews the numbers.

Jist makes me mad we can't construct a few LBRS / UBRS run to assist like 15 other guildies to catch up and be raid material. I'm not asking for handouts, loot, or to be carried at ALL. I'm asking for my guild to act like one. Ranks are not meant to funnel gear to 1 circle jerk group of friends while everybody else gets scraps.

Honorless target is poorly implemented because you do give honor after you res, so it's not very dissuasive. If someone wants honor they'll just kill you anyways and then kill you again.

PvP was fun and organic right before P2 hit. I let my subscription expire a few days ago after spending way too many hours getting from 51 to 54. A month ago, there were 7 of us happily playing. Now there's only 1 left and he's raid logging.

Not true
---
Fuck streamer plug ins
---
nope
---
Big respect.
---
Idk, according to census data my realm actually leans alliance. Probably due to realm transfers unfortunately
---
Well it is actually him
---
He is linked in the description as one of the people in the vid
---
If I'm alone and not looking to form a group, then I am looking for group (LFG). If I'm trying to build a group or have someone already with me then I'm looking for member((s)LFM). 
---
Alone I might be "healer LFG DM N, strat UD". With my tank friend we would be "LF3M dps for strat UD". 
---
It's always worked well.
---
I'm so happy to be on a foreigner server, people are nicer about these things than what's posted on this sub.
---
I wasn't questioning the number of layers, I was asking for evidence of 
---
&gt; Servers are bigger now and Blizzard messed up.
---
which I haven't seen any evidence of. Blizzard admitted before launch that servers were bigger than 2006 servers, but they also said each layer was the same size as a healthy 2004 server and they said recently that each server is now down to one layer. Are servers bigger now or not? Can I get a link with proof?
---
thats fine, go ahead and steal all the spirit gear you want. doesnt mean i have to.
---
Press D to dab on alliance.
---
Do you have a link with proof?
---
Charge people to tank instances.
---
Team America, fuck yeah!
---
Idk why your post made me immediately think of that.
---
Servers are down to one layer cause they merged them, not because everyone quit.
---
And I'm a firm believer that you're an idiot for having such stupid ideas. 
---
Making the user interface better looking and having the same information already accessible in a far more efficient and readable way is never a bad thing. Nothing an addon can do makes up for lack of skill, so you can stop blaming Addons for that.
---
EPL/Silithus wpvp could be introduced too. Instead it'll be p5 long after everyone is wore out from wpvp, just like in vanilla.
---
“Tank monkey, tank!”
---
You do realize that the layers were there because players were concentrated in zones, now they're spread around so layers are not necessary but the player size is the same. Or are you going to keep making things up without sources?
---
Gotcha. I feel stupid now.
---
Weapon skill is really, really good.
---
Fear &gt; wotf &gt; grenade or death coil &gt; fear
---
You can also just cast immolate then searing pain during it
---
Yes but good healers don’t drink every pull. There’s a balance here Reddittor’s just don’t seem to get.
---
I thought my ghost wolf form put me in stealth
---
2 of the 4 did it within the last two weeks.
---
&gt;Nothing I said is incorrect. I didn’t read anything wrong.
---
... wat? 
---
&gt;imo it should be 48 hour warning, 7 days, 30, perm. If you keep doing it after you're warned, you're an asshole who should be banned.
---
That is what i said. I said we should give "48 hour ***warning***" and then a perm ban; then you said "You don’t need a warning."
---
Implying to not give 48 hour warning bans, and go right to perm.
---
But no, you cant be wrong in any aspect of what you're saying, so noo you didnt misread anything at all. (btw i love the fact you went back and took the sentence out where you said you misread it)
---
Again, for the 15th time (i know you cant be wrong, so you will never answer this, you will just keep ignoring it) back up the statement "cops do not give warnings for breaking the law." and "Ignorance isn’t an excuse to break the rules." 
---
You said it, stand by it.
---
Didn't rly have a choice.
---
Dead.
---
I'm just looking for a link to the total concurrent player cap for a server ever since we went down to one layer per server, which was 3 weeks ago. Do you have evidence or a link to evidence?
---
And freaking PVE realms are filled with people who aren't interested in PVP. Shocker, i know.
---
Just started happening on Mograine-EU
---
And you are probs an american with a low IQ. They wern't a friend, never talked to them outside of small talk in guild chat. You don't seem to understand the whole point of my first reply was to point out that there are a lot of solo and tank friendly methods for getting gold. You don't even seem to care that a mail user who can't use the item they needed took it over a main spec leather user. You don't understand that prot warriors are a privileged class in this game. I do a lot for other people with no gain to myself and im not going to get into a dumb argument over what isn't and is selfless, tanks running instances for gold isn't selfless they are acting in self interest.
---
Would you use that for leveling too or go just frost while leveling then respect to frost fire
---
The lower ranks have rewards too. The amount of PvP we'll see post BGs is going to be the sweaty nerds who love ganking lowbies + whoever wants a break from BGs but still want to farm some honor. I.e, it's going to be worse than p1.
---
You had 2 months to reach 60 ... why haste now that it's too late?
---
I played both Humans and Night Elves in Warcraft 3, so it was natural to move over. Horde aesthetic just never really caught me. And then time went on and I realised gnome females are the best ever and now I can't change because I'd have to become tall again.
---
Eh not really buddy
---
No. He's reserving items ONLY for himself. That's a red flag. He's not reserving a lot of items, he's reserving only what he personally needs.
---
Nelf and human look the best.
---
Stormwind is the coolest city in the game.
---
Elwynn forest is my fav leveling zone.
---
Wont have to wait long for bg queues.
---
I can go invisible as a warrior.
---
Front flips while jumping.
---
Horde are ugly.
---
Too many reasons to count.
---
I have to rant here. How in the world do ppl have this much time to play this game. It honestly blows my mind. I was expecting there to be a lot of no-life’s, but it seems like everyone is able to dump hours and hours and hours into this game, even during weekdays. Like, don’t people have to work? Everyone on my server has been 60 for two months yet after putting every ounce of spare time I have I’m barely scratching the surface at lvl 58. Granted I work a lot of overtime and have a wife and kid, but still how the fuck do people have this much time. It makes no sense to me. Like what in the fucking world am I missing here.
---
So you have nothing but anecdotal evidence? Alright then.
---
Well, I think Blizzard should get some shit done maybe.
---
Allow all the dead weight players to get off PvP servers and onto PvE, and then try to merge the remainders on close to 50/50 actual pvp servers.
---
But Blizzard refuses to merge server as well "because might have the same names".
---
Its just a shitty situation all around, which could have and should have been avoided.
---
Just go to a PvE server if you don't like PvP. Seems pretty obvious, but I'll spoon feed you anyway.
---
Yeah he understands. But he's just a troll. Or maybe he's the scummy GM.
---
It was a decision we made among the group of friends I was going to play classic WoW with; mostly motivated by always having been horde, which started with me rolling a Tauren and telling friends they should play WoW and make sure to roll the same faction. So I suppose it comes from a love of Taurens?
---
These days I don't really care anymore. I'm invested in my current main, and I have one friend who plays classic left; that's all that's making me play horde right now.
---
That contributes, but the meta has changed.
---
Almost nobody understood the Vanilla Honor System at the time patch 1.4 hit (the phase 2 equivalent). Death squads were not a thing.
---
For comparison sake, the world first Ragnaros was a week AFTER phase 2 started during Vanilla. Most players were either leveling, running dungeons or doing progression raids. They were not roaming for honor.
---
I don't get it, locks have lifetap, and they use it, because that's how the class was designed, I just don't know why some healers are so angry about it.
---
You guys really want us to wand rather than lfetap?
---
on a pvp server you're supposed to organise a counter raid and fight back. Good luck!
---
No and on one does because Blizzard does not provide this information. 
---
If you played Vanilla back in the days you’d realize in 2 seconds that servers are bigger now. Lot of players will confirm this.
---
Please, warlocks i beg you - eat out of combat. I find it so rude when you life tap out of combat and don’t eat. I feel like warlocks think they’ve found this secret where they get infinite mana but you’re just wasting my drinks or I have to heal you when we get in combat and I’m not at 100%.
---
Its also for finishing off mobs! Themoreyouknow
---
I'm on an average EU PvP server, not super high or low pop, and i will bet both my nuts the populartion is at least twice that of a regular vanilla server.
---
I've played on a lot of private servers. I know what 3k population looks like, and this isn't it.
---
There's only one server like that, most high pop servers have the option to transfer to multiple servers so that's no excuse
---
Menethil Cruise Lines offer fantastic broiled gnome. Undead are crazy for it. The goblins can't hope to compete with their boats. It's a competition problem.
---
tidal charm lvl 37 and chained essence of eranikus sometime later idr
---
Preach!
---
Ok, so what is your server?
---
Wait...
---
That's like 8g/day here
---
Not seeing a castbar would be absolutely hilarious in PvP.
---
Gandling.
---
i make 500-1000 gold daily. i have nothing to spend my money on/in the game. Do you really think world of warcraft has economy ? ? ? hahahahahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahaha
---
I understand the parlance and the logic behind the two I just find even if you’re solo it seems much more effective to go the LFM route
---
Real-life Pepe?
---
hahaha
---
Use void -&gt; sac during opener -&gt; death coil -&gt; fel Dom second void and sac if somehow he is killing you before corruption and agony kills him
---
are honorable kills bugged? I have like 200 this week and it says 9
---
Who doesn't like a bit of cheese?
---
I appreciate your honor for switching factions but I'm sad to lose a whole-hearted ally like yourself.
---
I think I feel the same way. I'm always down to help my fellow Horde if they are getting attacked, and likewise, when I need help it seems like other Horde are always up for a fight.
---
When I watch these Alli death run videos they're always by themselves rezzing next to a group of Horde over and over without asking for help. I just don't understand. I genuinely feel bad that some people are having their experience ruined but I also don't see them helping themselves much.
---
Yeah, I also put some thought into what retail would have been like if it wasn't for DBM in perticular, after all every raid Blizz designs has to be designed in mind that 90% + of the playerbase has that addon installed, and now they are trying to basically put the DBM functions into the standard UI because of it.
---
I think anything that gives you big advantages in vanilla should be straight out banned, where you can ask yourself "am I on the same playing field as someone who doesn't have that addon?" and if no, fucking ban it.
---
Get rid off the bullshit PvP addons that shows castbars and buffs etc, the stupid spy addon.
---
&gt;When they do invite me, the run itself becomes very annoying. I'll ask them which way to go or what to pull and I'm met with complete silence.
---
Seems pretty simple to me. Noobs invite you, because they rather have a tank than no tank, but don't know shit themselves. Players who know their shit, cba to babysit a new tank.
---
Just use the noob groups to learn your things.
---
I've had my corpse make a trip to Undercity and back to Grom'gol while waiting around as a ghost. Funny to see at first, then you realize it's easier to take the flightmaster even if it takes 10 minutes.
---
again, horde rogue so your opinion means fuck all
---
"Yeah, we're pretty bad at tanking and healing. You should probably leave, I don't know how we'll find a replacement DPS for these arena runs."
---
what
---
toxic is such a blanket term now a days its terrible. everything someone doesn't like is toxic. this is toxic. thats toxic. no its fucking not lmao. you know whats toxic? when in league of legends you're carrying your whole team and your teammate still calling you a shit player and to kill yourself. or in overwatch when you make a single misplay and you get called a "typical dumb n-word". or even in wow, when you're healing and the tank overpulls, wipes the group, and the tank calls you a shitty player and kicks you from the party. THAT is toxicity. hell, i can say SOME aspects of wpvp are toxic, like a level 60 camping a 34 non stop for hours. sure, that is pretty toxic.
---
but the general wpvp that happens, especially on my server (grob...apparently we're the only server that universally agrees wpvp  is great on both sides and we all love it) isn't anywhere near toxic. sure its shitty if you gotta corpse run 6 times to get into BRM but then....don't go there? or just go when you have to? or god forbid instead of punching the air while walking back to your body for the 7th time, forming a raid prior and clearing out BRM before everyone goes into their dungeons/raids/whatever
---
i get it, it sucks sometimes, but it isn't fucking toxic lmao
---
&gt; Rewards should be proportional to the work that you put in.
---
Says who?
---
Pretty much no one runs with void when PvPing. Duels are way different than wPvP
---
&gt;You might as well try to claim that the MGS pachinko machines were made to try and bring MGS players into pachinko parlors. Uh....no, lol.
---
Actually... that's kinda the case. Lot weaker correlation, but yeah, that's actually part of it.
---
I definitely think way more people play both Classic and Retail than you'd think, or would be open to the other. The Retail subreddit has LOADS of people saying they came back for Classic, but continued into Retail and stayed there.
---
I get the Guardian Talisman at 40 on all of my Melee characters. Then it's the Stopwatch from the Badlands soon after
---
Every Inch of my journey I meet a new face.
---
[https://postimg.cc/bDrMTd3P](https://postimg.cc/bDrMTd3P)
---
I mean you just kinda proved my point tho, this is why you heal a warlock's lifetaps rather than having them drink between every pull and slow down their DPS rate
---
Yeah, but that was how it was in vanilla, there is no option for showing castbars. So if you have that addon installed, you have clear advantages over people who don't.
---
Spirit is better than both stam and int while leveling as warlock.
---
This might surprise you but I don't think he ended up getting anyone interested
---
Exactly what im doing. I even use an arms/prot spec and last stand is nice for dungeons and pvp!
---
Dude. If it weren't so much effort I would record and upload a video so u could see how utterly fucking asinine that data is.
---
I logged onto my mage last night to do an UBRS run so I could get the piece I need for the MC douse questline. We first tried to run in as a group of 7 people from burning steppes side, there were horde all the way from the bottom ramp running the entire path up. It took me 6 deaths just to get inside the very initial Gates of blackrock mountain. It took another 15 deaths to get actually inside UBRS. All told it took more time for us to get inside than to actually run the dungeon.
---
This is a normal thing on whitemane. I've literally had the exact same thing happen at midnight server time on a fucking Wednesday.
---
Lol yea must not go against the propaganda. Alliance all good, horde all bad. Got it
---
Lol yup. I think dps classes try to force the game to be faster than it is. I think people call em zoomers
---
Like i'm really interested in the weekly honor needed for Horde to get  their top brackets. They are constantly in 10+ man groups killing singler dudes. Are you hordies running around with 40k a wewk or some weak shit and it gets you into top 100?
---
If you read what i typed it said WHEN the healer drinks most warlocks dont even have food/water on them or bandages like most people are saying. According to you they shouldnt have to cause then they have to spend silver to drink. Also funny you think a healer gets full value out of the water they buy before people get antsy and they have to start healing.
---
Ds/ruin is better in raids when you cant put up dots but sm/ruin is better solo/5mans/pvp. Also, a raid might get you to go sm/ruin for imp buff in the tank group.
---
maraudon you aoe farming and hunter killing bosses and either one herb/mining
---
Well DPS Warriors dont even have a tier set so they are inherently at an advantage over Rogues when it comes to competition for weapons.
---
Giving everyone the same number of DKP when some classes need a lot more raid gear than others while also sharing some of the bis items with other classes that need very little makes for a very poor way of distributing loot.
---
Anyone?
---
It's a dps increase.
---
Yeah I do "slow" dps til 13k threat in the sense I cast a few shadowbolts instead of constantly. LIP never really worked for me that well, I always still had threat after it ended. I've taken up the scuffed strat of SSing myself and taking the inevitable p3 death to get the free threat wipe and just go apeshit on her lol
---
Lot of people questioning the data here...understandable as these census websites are not too accurate. Let's assume the data is correct though, Asmongolds army of Alliance spergs are mostly inactive or going back to retail once his stream ends. 
---
The real joke is the fact that people  didn't see this coming rolling alliance on Faerlina.
---
Heals are free for thee but not for me.
---
Queues? You do know bg’s will be cross-server right?
---
Same with all my friends who just missed the cut off. 56, 57, 54, 52, 48. They only log on when me and my other friend who no lifed it to 60 are around to chain run them through dungeons.
---
Escape artist ins't that great either, IMO. If it was instant, and/or worked on stuns it would be great.
---
DD
---
Losing to warlocks is more frustrating than losing to mages when the lock doesn’t even have to fear and stuff XD. At least with a mage I can sometimes make them use a lot of resources to kill me so I feel better about myself with double ice block cold snap. Gotta get my shadow reflector crafted and maybe I can reflect a curse of agony one of these days zzz. Solo warrior is rough no matter who I fight though
---
Transmutes. Arcanite usually
---
To assume that a money-hungry company is willing to shit on their own profits out of some false pride is insane. They're gonna do what fetches the most money. If Classic is profitable, they're not gonna ignore it because "then they'd admit being wrong," because the shareholders would rip them apart for that. After their stock tanked like 40% late last year with weak Blizzcon (including Immortal), you can bet they're just going for the crowd-pleasing actions at the moment.
---
Companies aren't people. Companies don't have pride like people. What they have is a deep, nigh-infinite greed because *that's what companies exist for.*
---
I never played all the way to naxx in vanilla so I can't confirm or deny but I have been told by multiple people that warlocks outscale mages and warriors outscale all. Just going off what I was told by reputable and knowledgeable people.
---
How it feels being a quest mob, on the starting zone, on release day.
---
It is when its balanced or near balanced. The problem is blizzard letting people transfer off near balanced servers and making them 80/20 instead of 60/40
---
Yeah, why is nobody in the world chat asking "Hey, anyone wants to form a raid to purge Searing gorge/BRM" or something similar. If I play horde and say I am getting ganked, people will whisper me immediately and ask where I am. 
---
While on the alliance, I ask lvl 60s to help with a questmob that basically right next to them and they cba.
---
Its obviously not always the case, but it sure as shit seems way way more common on alliance as someone who has played alliance twice on two different servers, and its exactly the same experience.
---
I will see how it goes as I get higher lvl, but so far I am not suprised at all as to why alliance is getting dumpstered in PvP on most servers if they are always playing that egotistically.
---
In my experience it’s more common than you’d think, or I just have horrible luck.  You were speaking on the side of healers, I was speaking from the perspective of the warlock. What you actually play as is irrelevant.
---
I gave examples of in and out of combat lifetap recovery times and the associated cost, and out of combat follows the same rules since the conversation is about warlocks not bandaging/eating. The math is still the same. 6-9 seconds to bandage and eat (19s20c) or 35+ to eat twice (14s40c). The downtime vs 1-2 heals (3-6 seconds) slows the group down and has a cost to it that is above the cost for the cast time(s) and eventual recovery time for mana.
---
Point stands.
---
Hey, relax. Things are going to be fine.
---
Take a dungeon. Any dungeon. Look at a detailed video guide of the dungeon. Really look at it from beginning to end.
---
Start a group. Post "Tank LF Healer and DPS for XXX" in the channels Lookingforgroup or World. Get your party. Tell them you are going to take it slow. 
---
Go to the dungeon. Follow the guide. You know where to go now. Maybe you forgot, look it up again. Pull whatever you think is necessary on your way. Say sorry if you make a mistake. 
---
Mark a skull target. Hit skull once with Sunder. Dont tank skull target afterwards. Tank the other targets. You taunt skull target once it runs over to the mage. Or you use Concussive Blow on it. Or you ignore it. Tank the other targets. DPS can handle skull target.
---
Its fine. Everything is fine. You are not the first warrior in the world to be new to L. 60. You can manage.
---
I levelled a priest and had to tell every lock in my dungeons to life tap. 1 renew can be at least half a mana bar and it makes them have no need to drink. They keep doing damage on the next pull while I drink (if I even need to, 5 second rule is so underrated while levelling).
---
I can see a free character transfer was opened for your server, that's definitely not "average" but "overcrowded, please move".
---
Census data shows 5k concurrent online for your server, this is why your experience doesn't match 3k indeed. 
---
Also, people are lazy at your server with censuses, please help the community https://wowclassicpopulation.com/contribute
---
Same, I'm loving classic but I've kept one toe in retail the whole time because nothing in classic scratches that competitive itch. For all it's flaws, raiding in retail is by far the most fun and challenging cooperative group pve content in any game I've ever played
---
No changes is, ironically, what keeps classic as far away from vanilla as possible. A few guards here or there and things like that will affect the gameplay a lot less than 100+ lvl 60s constantly ganking you where ever you're going.
---
Just another retail reject. The guy probably doesn’t understand down ranking his heals.
---
I can understand impatient people, but really plenty can learn fast. I had an AWESOME priest who pretty much single-handedly guided the team through the entirety of Blackrock Depths. The tank knew how to handle pulls for the most part minus some specific details mentioned or discussed or quickly figured out, he just didn't know where to go specifically in maze-like dungeons. With a little guidance, most of us being noobs, and not all at high level for BRD we cleared almost everything, including the majority of relevant quests.
---
She does Solo tribute, you do solo dm e.
---
This is horde coping with their longer bg queues.
---
Tailoring, lotta clothies end up grabbing tailoring so leveling first aid is a no go until 60.
---
It’s pretty fair in my opinion to let pugs roll.
---
The raid lead reserving any kind of personal loot is pretty BM in my opinion.  I raid lead and do 90% of our guides recruiting but don’t reserve anything.  I put in the work because I want to cultivate the kind of guild that lasts.  My reward is being in this guild and playing with friends.  I’ll get loot in time just like everyone else.
---
I would recommend finding another guild honestly.  There are lots of fair guilds out there.  Your raid lead has already demonstrated that their getting gear is more important that you getting gear.
---
We summoned this alt + two others included a lock to the island, so that we could summon people there to hand in MC quests and get dowses.  Did it before raid, popped about 10 people over, boom now we have plenty of waters.  It was fun :P
---
I love videos like this, also from Uber Danger. Can anyone recommend more “classic wow adventure” funny video series similar to this? Thanks :)
---
Don't waste your time, that guy's a dunce.
---
You're mean
---
I have no idea why people think blizzard can stand on “time zones are hard”. This is a solved problem. World of Warcraft has battled this problem for 15 years. Are people really implying that retail has similar issues?
---
You're also probably pretty bad at the game. If you're barely 58, you've either played an extremely small amount of time, or you're not good at being efficient while you're playing.
---
What's with the weird scrollbar?
---
I'm sorry.
---
It's like this a good portion of the time on Heartseeker too. 
---
Love seeing that party boat pull up with red all over it.
---
Someone’s had their fear kicked one too many times obviously.
---
I mean it was literally the least populated server at launch, and i'm not gonna leave behind my friends, family and guild. Opening up server transfers isn't really an option for most people.
---
We literally chose the server as it was looking to be the least popular, switching off all the other ones first. There is nothing we could have done short or somehow coordinating a giant transfer with every single friend we had on the server at the same time.
---
Sunk cost fallacy works better imo if there's only 2 options, but they have a third option to just unsubscribe and derive more enjoyment from a different game than continuing to play on a PvP server or rerolling on a PvE, that's why it doesn't apply imo.
---
I hate being a healer when you go up to save someone with over 4K healing done and you get zero credit for the kill.
---
its not about the quality of the item, its about rarity. rhok drops every second week and every bob hunter has it because its so common. he should be more worried about getting to roll for a qsr for example.
---
lol no it isn't. Show me some numbers...
---
with savage glad chest and lionheart i assume its a troll or something.
---
Ahh. That makes sense.
---
except addons have been available since vanilla (and were even more powerful then)
---
So other players are ruining your fun, so you are going to ruin your own fun to get back at them?
---
Epic gamer move!
---
You lucky son of a bitch. Congrats!
---
Yeah, but if you make a battle group with 4 PvP servers and all of them are 70:30 Horde, you still have more than twice as many Horde queuing for BGs. And given that it's generally accepted that the Horde are more interested in PvP, that ratio will probably be worse. 
---
The Alliance will do what they usually did on pservers and set up coordinated premades with class and gear requirements. Aly pugs will get trashed and queue less frequently. Aly premades will wreck everything and people will complain that it's not fair.
---
 Just my predictions of course.
---
its clearly an orc
---
OMG lol
---
Every server existing at launch was bound to be overcrowded. Some spillover servers happen to be overcrowded lol.
---
Anyway, I am definitely not blaming you, I am just saying 5k server is still better than 0.5 server for sure.
---
If you don’t need anything from AV rep I guess that’s cool? Also, players do kill squads during queues. Would make things way worse if their best option was to queue and hearth back to kill squad area for queue then mage port back to start queue after each BG
---
Ony neck is BIS until Naxx though
---
Arcanite transmute is not worth it, at least on my server. It’s a 48 hour cool down and the profit is like 5g. If you do fire &gt; earth it’s a 24 hour cool down and the profit is like 3-5g each.
---
Yes it is. And I swear if you reply something like "well you just have to do -insert profession here- don't even bother replying. Professions are not class specific.
---
Between that and the useful idiots talking about the best way to farm as a prot warrior is to roll a gold farming alt, ie not play warrior, this sub just needs to not give advice to prot warriors.
---
Yeah I think I'm just gonna use Clique with the default Blizzard raid frames. They are good enough and Clique creates the mouseover macros for you.
---

Look at the post where a poor fellow was tricked like you by GM answer then was stomped to dirt after delayering proven him oh so wrong  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dk6gx5/layering\_does\_not\_affect\_server\_capacity/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dk6gx5/layering_does_not_affect_server_capacity/) 
---
How come you are so ignorant?
---
I'm not saying it doesn't, I just remembered never being able to, and was wondering how it worked so I was looking up the elements you use.
---
You assume that the dominant side automatically have worse tactic? Lol
---
Right. But the same can't be said of tanks. So many runs don't happen because they couldn't find a tank.
---
I want that ring for pvp on my mage but my guild just laughs at me :(
---
I dunno. I enjoy wpvp as an alliance player on a horde dominated server. There are so many alliance not pvping so it makes it easier to rank imo. I've been in brm all day and I've seen only a handful of alliance coming down here to pvp. I've raked in so much honor.
---
Skelly horse is best mount.
---
Except he’s right. With imp drain soup, your regen from spirit is doubled for a short period. A lock with good spirit never ever stops pulling, even before dark pact.
---
See that’s the attitude of entitlement that you can only get away with when you play a tank. Talking about how you have to rip yourself away, and “carry your Trainwreck of a pug” is so stupid. Most pug groups especially at or near 60 are pretty dang solid and only require you to stand there and be beat on, not shoulder the burden of everything. 
---
Your just greedy and know you can get away with that kind of attitude because people will put up with you in order to get their item or quest. Just know that tanks that behave this way usually end up with a reputation and it ain’t good.
---
This is just gonna increase suffering.
---
I can't get behind this.
---
"Sometimes it's better to be nice than correct."
---
ikr the one mage that drops and then you can see the cam looking up made me lol
---
No transfers available?
---
horde have burning steppes on lockdown.. no way. even the gate from redridge mtns to steppes.  much longer.. the thorium point death run is the shortest on my server.
---
I haven't seen Lord of the Rings but I can tell this is a funny video
---
Unsubbed. If it's fixed by end of Dec I'll consider re-subbing, otherwise there are lots of other games out there. Grizzlybear on blowme server.
---
Have you ever heard of Warlocks and their abilities?
---
I laugh every time I read this
---
Night elves are the best in WC3 and they are the best in vanilla as well. Best aesthetics, starting zone, mount, they are the only one that can be druids, everything goes in their way.
---
&gt;I proceeded to main a shaman almost until cata before finally shelving it for a class that isn't pigeonholed into healing. 
---
How is it pigeon holed into healing? I didn't do higher tier progression raids but I did just fine as enhancement. Though, I really loved PVP resto, especially arenas.
---
They did a good enough job on spy imo. It's practically useless in pvp.
---
Calm down reverend. I didn't say a single thing to indicate my own feelings on the subject. Simply that defending the use of off color humor doesn't inherently mean one supports the subject. Clearly you didn't read my post at all if all you got from it is that I allegedly think molesting children is funny. You don't need to have some short circuit instant rage anytime others don't also leap into a blind fury.
---
how many other Octopusbreads do u know
---
Hahaha people so desperate for more info, basicly ddosing the chat? Sweet.
---
The _average_ player is probably mid to late 20's single guys who work a job and then spend most of their free time playing. So if they get home from work at 5 or 6, they can play until they go to sleep which is 6 hours easy. Then on weekends, 12+ hours each day if they have no other obligations. 
---
Now, let's talk about the intense players. These players likely have gig economy jobs like uber driver where they can work a lot for a month to bank up money, and then live off of it for another month while going on a complete WoW binge. Construction work can be like this too, where you can get on a 1 or 2 month job and work crazy hours, and then fuck off until you need money again. This is a lot more common than you'd think. 
---
Lastly, there are people who may have disabilities or otherwise are collecting welfare or unemployment, and they can sustain themselves in low cost of living areas by doing very little other than playing wow.
---
WoW, and especially classic wow, is just a huge time sink. So it attracts people who have a lot of time to invest in the game, because the reward of the game scales with time invested.
---
I guess if you can't click 2 buttons every ~30 seconds it could be hell for you.
---
The question is, was it possible for an addon to show castbars in vanilla?
---
some classes can solo farm DME(whole thing) for tons of gph but it can be difficult and only really worth if you have mining 300 for the 3 RTVs at the end. 
---
its common for warriors/shamans to duo farm it, preferably one has mining other has herb
---
plenty of videos and guides out there for what classes can do what exactly, IE im pretty sure mages can't solo the whole thing but they can do lasher farm for good gold, same as priests w/ holy nova.
---
The issue is that the servers aren’t called “real” or “hardcore” servers. 
---
They are called PvP servers and I assume other people like me imagined hey I might like to PvP.
---
Turns out there isn’t any real PvP to speak of yet, just a bunch of disorganized griefing and laggy clusterfucks.
---
Pro tip, if you blink in slow fall you fall straight down
---
first off, warriors have DME jump runs which is amazing farm. this guys issue is that hes prot...no reason to be prot at 60. at all. also, he probably doesn't have mining. if he does, he needs to respec to fury/prot, get a couple decent weapons, and do jump runs with a shammy/other partner. 
---
second, he can run live strat and reserve the first orb, or even reserve the first orb and do round robin orbs after that assuming the group is down to run a few. or just run it over and over reserving first orb. a decent group can clear strat live in what, 40 mins? good group 30? orbs go for 30g on my server, not bad gold by any means. it just seems like this guy is upset he cant make gold but is doing literally everything he can to make it hard to make gold (prot, probably no mining, etc)
---
Unpinning the bugs doesn't mean they won't fix them, any more than pinning it meant they would.
---
It was likely unpinned because the number of duplicate bug reports dropped down.
---
No, who said that making BG queues not terrible would be justified with “well we changed other stuff so might as well”?
---
Do you know how to get the morrowgrain quest? I can’t seem to receive it on my human character.
---
A single player turning a 1h run into a 2h run has literally not happened to me once during all of classic. I've just never encountered someone so bad that a run wasn't salvageable or resulted in that big of a time loss. You're free to kick whoever you want, but I think it's generally a shitty thing to do, and that you should be more careful about who you bring to your run.
---
Edit: I'm just going to pass on answering your passive aggressive insult.
---
i mean, he is prot. and probably doesn't have mining. if he went fury/prot and got 300 mining then he would have 0 issues making gold. it just seems like he is uninformed or something.
---
I mean proof for the number of "6k", as far as we know Blizz maybe increased the number of players-per-layer by 500 or somesuch.
---
Letting anyone die only screws yourself. This makes zero sense.
---
&gt;"This shouldn't be allowed because it's not in vanilla".
---
People were using that argument kinda to defend Spy when that was nerfed. They said something funny like "addons were in vanilla".
---
But as we all know, some addons will drastically change the course of the game, and the most infamous one is gearscore. And if they are allowing addons that showcases castbars that "everyone" have anyways, then they should just open it up in the standard UI or get rid off it.
---
imo
---
Definitely approaching this backwards. You don't award items to pickups in the hope they will join you, you award, as you say, loyality, and award the items to the people turning up every week to your raid. I am not sure if you are trying to be flippant or not, but the guy should have the leaf, and if the other hunters want it, they can just come back next week.
---
Edit: Incidentally, downvoting in reddit is supposed to be for non relevant content, not for something you disagree with.
---
Especially undead, I cannibalize every chance I get. It’s free real estate.
---
Ok definitely a dick move but DAMN that is hilarious.
---
I play alliance, and my little brother plays horde. I know for a fact that we are different people because I was born several years before he was.
---
This isn't retail, 3 months into weekly farmed molten core means the average player has 4 pieces of raid loot.  Because of that, you need to farm the best gear you can get outside of the weekly rng raid loot that you cannot control.
---
It's so damn stupid that private server staffs, who hosted servers out of their moms basements, did a better job than a billion dollar company.
---
Or people can just download em.
---
Do you have any proof that it's actually honorspy causing the lag?
---
As a priest I am leery of any warlock in a group. There have jsut been a couple that could not manage lifetaps and waited for the WORST times to do them.
---
Just use life tap sporadically through a fight so renew can heal you, y'all. Dont dump it all at once that makes it look like you got aggro / leave so little life that a mob can sneeze and kill you.
---
Usually its fine though.
---
I only play female taurens. One single reason.
---
big tiddy cow gf
---
Don't g forget your also getting 5% crit in the rest tree
---
This is so common in Classic for some reason, in Vanilla *everyone* had max First Aid.
---
I really think Blizzard hates classic success
---
Set up some macros for marking. It makes marking take almost no effort, its the only way I can even mark misspulls.
---
I don't play on a 80/20 server. Most servers aren't 80/20, there are quite a lot which are 60/40 ish, but even on that ratio you can still form co-ordinated raids to clear out the zones.
---
and if the guy who posted the video is, there was still a lot dead alliance running to their corpses who could have grouped up instead of trying to run in one and one, at least they would have a better chance that way.
---
Learn about downranking heals when you hit endgame if you aren't aware of it.
---
Don't bother with enchanting unless you need a BoP item from it like heart of the mountain. It doesn't make money unless you're incredibly dedicated to sitting in a capital spamming and started a couple months ago.
---
Tailoring is nice for the robe, nothing wrong with it.
---
Always take skinning while leveling for the "free" gold if it's your first character. Otherwise it doesn't matter much. You will kill a lot of beasts as you level, so might as well pull a bit extra.
---
How is it an attitude of entitlement?
---
&gt; Considering it should be obvious they sort through tickets by order of submission
---
Congratulations, you've made it abundantly clear within seconds that you have never worked a CS job in your life, and have literally no clue what you're talking about. 
---
CS tickets, in any job, just about *anywhere*, work in a prioritization queue, not an order received queue. Usually something like informational (re: no real priority), low, moderate, high, critical. Cheating and active player disruption would not be put on the stack below Jimmy can't figure out how to reset his email because it came 2 seconds later. Topics are handled by *priority* and *then* order received you nincompoop. Player griefing is near the top of that stack.
---
 Good job though, you've shown you have no qualms acting confident and insulting about a topic you clearly know nothing about. An astounding character trait to have. 
---
&gt; "It probably has to be reviewed . . . and move up the chain of command"
---
Dude what lmfao. You have zero clue what you're talking about. That's not how any CS system works at all, especially Blizzards. They don't need to "send it up the chain of command" to ban someone for cheating or initiate an intervention to players griefing. Please, please please, stop talking. You're embarrassing yourself. Every single major CS system in the world emphasizes act fast, review and apologize later if there is misfires. They aren't spending hours in a bureaucratic process letting people cheat because they need "approval", they're just understaffed and can't respond fast enough.
---
enhance shaman says hi
---
But then you have great advantages over people who doesn't have it, so again why not just make it standard UI then?
---
It was added in TBC anyways, and it exists on the client, so just do it.
---
Damn, I should have transferred when I had the chance.
---
Lol we are getting downvoted cause we are horde 😂.
---
So yeah like I said the majority faction will slaughter the minority one. Which doesn't directly mean Alliance are unilaterally exterminated, and That's what the other guy and myself were unsure on your reasoning for.
---
&gt;You have any idea how hard it is to farm 30g/hr on a tank? Vs the 100g/hr you can farm as a warlock...
---
alright, exaggerate a bit less please. first off, if you're prot at 60 and don't have mining, you simply aren't gonna make dick for gold. just how it is. so once you've come out of 2006 and into 2019 and switched to fury/prot and got 300 mining you can duo DME jump runs and make lots of gold. i don't recall exact gold per hour but just about all the warriors in my guild do it (and we have a lot...4 raid teams each with 2 warrior tanks and anywhere from 5-8 warrior dps each) and they love it. but again, you can't do it as prot (afaik) and you need 300 mining. not asking for anything crazy there.
---
second, 100g/hr as a warlock? you aren't wrong, but that is in a very specific scenario, and if the warlock gets good luck with either books, arcane crystals, or a RNG epic boe drop, which shouldn't be accounted for in any gph calculation anyway. 
---
for a warlock to make 100g/hr they A. gotta be farm spec, which is useless for anything but farming. B. need to have 300 mining. C. not only know how to do the DME jump run solo BUT be able to do it with no deaths and do it efficiently. Without those 3 things it will never be 100g/hr, or close. mining is more or less needed 100% to make jump runs worth it, and even then you can have garbage luck with arcane crystals. you also have to take into account that it isn't the easiest thing to learn, and a few hours will probably be spent fucking up, dying, going slow, etc etc. It is a farm that actually genuinely takes skill.
---
I replied above, warlock part:

---
Can confirm. Grobbulus is an amazing server. I have a buddy in the UK who plays with us and he says the latency isnt an issue. Hope you find a server you enjoy!
---
?? most tier pieces are pvp items and the non tier items are usually the BiS pieces
---
Do you feel the same when rogues and warriors roll on Blackcrow or Carapace Spine xbow?
---
Jesus fuck, why is it so hard to just download it? If you don’t have it, you’re at a disadvantage yes, so just download it and don’t be a noob.
---
I mean few weeks ago I was farming devilsaur and I could get up near 135g/hr if un'goro was dead. locked down 3 devilsaur spawns, roamed for a 4th, and found herbs in between. this was when devilsaur was above 6g though, so not TOO long ago but not super recent. 
---
then again, just about any class that can kill a devilsaur can do this, not warlock only. but warlock it was ezpz. i also doubt this is what the guy is talking about since devilsaur has tanked across the board on all servers.
---
Yeah, you are right.
---
The majority will dumpster the minority, but there will be more majority horde servers hence "alliance being exterminated", at least off those servers.
---
Morgan's Vigil is camped at all times on my server (Noggenfogger EU)
---
No int, no spirit, only 13 more spellpower but you're losing 1% crit compared to the T2 pants for mages at least. The further into gearing you go the more crit becomes worth because it's multiplicative with spell power.
---
Even if you're just using skyshroud at that point I have a hard time feeling it's worth 8 mooncloth and 10 essence of fire for that.
---
Fair enough, wasn’t my intention :)
---
ripppp
---
Welp, I guess I'm that bad. Leveled as a Holy priest, didn't feel like I needed FA, and I'm a tailor so every cloth counts.
---
In not booting noobs, I'm booting people who won't follow direction, and continue to oom the healer by fucking the Line of Sight pulls.
---
I'm the primary recruiter in my guild and have helped run and level dozens of guildies man. It isn't noobs.
---
It's assholes.
---
No, that's definitely not okay. Classic community has failed and created this abomination of balance. 
---
So, how do you intend to fix it?
---
Rumour on the street is that it's an addon that's malfunctioning and sending massive spams into chat.

Why would any pug join your raid if items are reserved? People respond to incentives.
---
You control the loot when you have a full roster. You can't do that when you have pugs.
---
I'm not downvoting you by the way.
---
Yeah but then everyone with an 800x900 monitor has an advantage, unless blizz is going to mail everyone one.
---
It's very good for resto druids too and I would imagine shamans.
---
I happily paid 80g for mine, was my BIS until the T2 helm dropped.
---
What is a census?
---
Yeah, I've been playing with the same crew for a really long time. We made the decision a loooonngg time ago when transfers initially were a thing. I'm stuck, but I'm with my friends so it's alright? Lol
---
My friend is 52. He obviously quit when phase 2 came along. The servers just has too many players for å system like this to work
---
That last bit is lost on so many newer players in Classic. I'm leveling a 3rd alt to 60 (second Warrior so dungeons are miserable again) and every time some Dickhead opens with "hey you can pull more, we will kill it fast with AoE" you can bet the person doesn't understand about threat and will most likely wipe the group multiple times. 
---
I'm really not trying to exaggerate either, I just fucking avoid Mages and Warlocks like the plague because more often then not they are brain dead players who tend to be impatient as fuck. I have seen multiple mages in the lvl35-50 area completely fucking up rotations -  Cone of Cold into a Frost Nova, or my personal favorite - kiting a humanoid around while killing another because they went 45 levels without seeing the Polymorph spell.
---
I'm not even a slow dungeon crawler either, I'm just not going to pull 3 packs because one of the players in our group can AoE (I am leveling my Warrior with a Shaman friend so I stack melee mostly)
---
all of the 5 man content is trivial AF. however, a lot of dps still somehow suck at this game. if i was rich and wanted to clear a dungeon fast, along with having someone who isn't gonna roll on the loot i need, i'd buy a dps assuming they were full pre-bis with some BiS MC stuff, knew the dungeon, etc etc. 
---
sure DPS are common but GOOD dps are not as common as you think. at least good enough that it makes a difference in kill time/dungeon clear time. i wouldn't pay more than 15g though.
---
Lack of int/spi never stopped BiS guides from recommending random green world drops that offer nothing besides spell power though.
---
yep, and i hear nobody then complaining about warriors and rogues rolling on those bows. I wonder why. Maybe because rogues and warriors are entitled p*eces of sh*ts, while hunters are pacificist and nice people generally who just want gear and not be bullied by others.
---
Oof, I'm alliance so I wouldn't know, but I believe it.
---
Draenei and blood elves are in classic. Just not playable as a race
---
Why the fuck should I have to download 3rd party configurations to play on the same field?
---
Why should that even be a thing, its not a thing in other games. If it was small customizations like making your bag prettier then whatever, but shit that drastically changes the gameplay be should be nuked by Blizzard.
---
I think retail would have been a better game for sure right now if they did that earlier, altough addons have had some positive impacts on the game.

Don't need to respec for tribute runs.

lol this. everytime im like.. ill be a good guy, ill sit down eat/drink... 0.5 seconds later. healed to full. dang son. thanks though
---
Download the most recent version. The sync cooldown was already increased heavily.
---
If it was HonorSpy at all, then because it was previously only syncing the data tables between guild members each time you die.
---
Now it syncs everytime you successfully inspect a player, or die.
---
As that was indeed to spammy, the cooldown until you sync again has been heavily increased. Just update the addon.
---
Edit: And half of your addon functionality description is wrong. Check the code at Github.
---
Right so the warning makes sense then. 
---
You know how easy it is to get on top of the inn in Westfall? It's literally a short jump. I've done it by accident as a mage.
---
&gt; ***Please also note that our realm population estimates of Low, Medium, High, and Full are based on this increased capacity – a Medium realm today already has more characters on it than even the most crowded realms did back in 2006.*** 
---
Of course, since every classic server had \~5 layers each size of vanilla server. 
---
They have only 1 layer now.
---
&gt; My only wish is that they design encouters in a way you dont need dbm
---
You don't need DBM in vanilla, but that addon probably single handely fucked up raiding on retail.
---
Blizzard said their reasoning for breaking spy was something like "it hightens the player's senses" or something like that, and if they were concistent on that quote, then more addons should go. Which would be a good thing for the game.
---
Rumours that the honorspy addon is causing it, which makes sense timewise (started happening soon after honor was released and people started using this addon en mass)
---
Statements like this tell me you're not very good at the game, or haven't played in any guild that's moderately decent. Contrary to your above statement, DKP is actually the hard "nope" from any decent player.
---
As I've said, I've seen both systems go horribly wrong, but I've personally seen significantly more bullshit come out of &lt; 18 months of raiding in DKP guilds than I've seen across my 6+ years in LC guilds.
---
I am Horde on Arugal and I was looking forward to pvping and ranking but now I just raid log. There is just no Alliance and even if I do manage a 1v1 horde just roll in, it’s really not fun at all. Hopefully with the Bgs coming out it will get much better
---
Ok since you're such a fucking genius, whats the solution? Because "lol go reroll PvE" is a good way to kill the game. I've got two 60s on Whitemane. I'll unsub before I start over again and so will a lot of people. Do you wanna be smug or do you want Classic to be a success?
---
Yeah and my dad's the CEO at microsoft. 
---
People going online to have internet debates on video game forums trying to act like they're above other people having internet debates on video game forums is a timeless bit though. 
---
Even if you make that kind of money with that job, the fact you feel the need to flex it on a video game forum internet debate to 'win' is probably the saddest thing I've seen in a while.
---
He was probably alliance and listened to people on here that told him to reroll
---
Edit: Typo
---
Is it shadowlands beta?
---
That’s not for purchasing, it’s for equipping. Before that patch you had to maintain your rank to even use the gear
---
classic encounters ARE designed in a way that you don't need DBM, people still use it
---
Balance is an illusion. Even with 50/50% active one faction may and often will participate less in wPVP or War Effort and the effect will be the same. Also if the server is 20k instead of 3k then no wonder you get big groups everywhere.
---
“WoW”
---
Worlds smallest violin for you and your sad life... ;)
---
That's exactly what they said.
---
Or make the roofs so you can't reach them.
---
That site says it is 55 45 for horde, which means the wowclassicpopulation is within the margin* of error
---
I'm terrible at math and can still look at numbers.
---
Go on, look at the server info we have for NA and EU realms and tell me why queue times won't be awful for Horde.
---
no it doesnt "trigger" me like obviously pugs should roll on loot thats not reserved, and im happy that the homie got his leaf/bow and yea it sounds like you guys got a good group
---
I've started playing csgo alot more lately.
---
50/50 is a lot better than 70/30
---
Any fire damage spells are going to be useless in MC (you going to deal fire damage to Ragnaros bro?). Furthermore, the build requires you to cast immolate which would take up a debuff slot that would be better used on literally anything else in a raid scenario. While conflag builds might be usable (and have the highest damage ceiling) in some dungeon scenarios and PvP, it's not even remotely in consideration for raids, and if any raid leader worth their salt sees you in a conflag build, you'll be asked to respec or just outright kicked from the group.
---
Side note: do you really want to farm shards for soul fire?
---
So this is what’s causing the lag makes perfect sense
---
PlatinumWoW's Beta videos are in a similar style. Worth a watch.
---
Hinterlands azshara desolace badlands
---
Yeah no. Entitlement is more like expecting someone to drop what they are doing to help YOU get something for 0 benefit themselves.
---
What's wrong with DBM, cast bars and auction addons? Especially cast bars I don't get.
---
Im currently tankning the easier instances with 31/5/15. Makes it possible to do stuff solo as well which I find v. nice!
---
Entitlement, entitlement everywhere.
---
No loot system is perfect. While DKP is the most corruptible system you can pick (hence why joining DKP guilds is a bad idea), LC does suffer from the human element. Running a LC well requires a lot of thought and effort on the part of the leadership.
---
You sound so grumpy.
---
Well, they also have to roll the right class. So Warlock or mage, maybe a rogue if you're feeling a bit more adventurous.
---
See my reply below to a similar concern of another commentor.
---
18 days and about to hit 60, youre fine
---
You aint farming honor killing someone 10 times over corpsecamping them.
---
While true, 1% crit is worth more than 13 spellpower by P3.
---
&gt; far more dmg, utility, and fun
---
Damage? Paladins have one really good spec, damage isn't a factor.
---
Utility? Holy Paladins excel at utility and have the best buffs minus windfury.
---
Fun? 100% opinion.
---
The fact you think paladins are terrible and list "fun" as one of the reasons completely negates your entire argument.
---
Yeah same on my server. I just started a twink for BGs with lvl 19 😅🤷‍♂️
---
I loved lvling with dark pact. Dump all my mana each fight, lifetap only when needed to maintain continual dps. Moment fight was over spam dark pact. By the time next fight happens I’d be at 85-100% hp and full mana.
---
Faction queues. Any time one faction outnumbers another by X% that faction is placed in a queue. 
---
Continue to offer free server transfers for the majority faction to smaller servers. 
---
If none of that works and they're desperate. Free faction transfers from dominant faction to smaller faction. What that means for Paladins and Shaman? I dont know... Blizz can figure that out.
---
I loved one mage i saw, aoe'd a large pack before our tank had done anything. They all pulled and rushed to him and the healer, frost nova then blink everything pummels the healer down. Mage then complains.

&gt;Warlock -Spirit * 0.07 + 6
---
It literally scales for warlocks the worst in the game. It's bad. It's good for warriors because that .07 is a .8 for them. It's bad for warlocks, the math is there, it's bad bad bad.
---
I’m kinda in the same spot but reversed. I’ve always preferred the aesthetics of the alliance but all my friends for some reason loves the horde and wouldn’t dream of playing alliance. So here I am playing my hunch backed male undead once again:(
---
I wish I would have had your strength. I didn't want to play on a PVP server because I knew this shit was going to happen. But they regaled me with all this (turned out to be horseshit) about how, "oh yeah if you're getting camped you just /yell in zone and a bunch of people will come help, or you ask your guild and they will drop what they're doing and come own the horse for you!" Etc etc. My bullshit-o-meter was going apeshit but I figured it was better to play on a PVP server with friends than alone on a PVE.
---
Well fast forward 2 months and all but 1 of them has quit wow because they're "bored" and the one who stuck around admitted to me he didn't want to play on pvp either but because they were his RL friends he backed them up.
---
It's been like this for 2 weeks and its making the game un-fucking playable.
---
Bad news homie, if you have an EU wow sub you have to make a separate wow account and pay a sub to NA wow as well to access NA servers, was in a similar situation.
---
Couldn’t agree more. Maybe if Shadowlands actually pulls retail’s game design really far back in the direction of Classic it’ll be a problem, but I think that’s being wildly optimistic about Shadowlands and the general evolution of an MMO with this many expansions cobbled together. 
---
I’d expect that the vast majority of players who came to Classic from retail (at least the ones following the hype) who are going to leave did so already. Anecdotally, practically everyone in my guild has either been not playing much WoW at all for years, or has dabbled in Vanilla private servers recently and that’s about it. None of us are talking about Shadowlands lol
---
Others have reported this to the devs, we (shamans) aren't supposed to be able to dismiss our totems in vanilla
---
Very helpful, thank you. Axes it is (when appropriate).
---
Some are just looking at their raid frames they don’t have set up to show bandaging.
---
That's some major cognitive dissonance. You're basically saying that you're entitled to other people's time, while other people (tanks) aren't entitled to yours. You can't have it both ways bud.
---
I assume you are familiar with the concept of supply and demand. Look at the issue from that standpoint and you'll probably get less worked up.
---
&gt;usually end up with a reputation
---
A bad tank won't be able to charge for his services for long. Reputation is everything in Classic and charging for one of the rarest commodities in the game isn't going to affect that for a good tank. Quite the opposite. He'll get plenty of business once he's done it a few times.
---
I suppose this is your first Classic rodeo, in which case you're used to being able to switch specs on the fly, far more tanking classes, etc. In that case I can somewhat understand your frustration.
---
They are better for certain classes... Warrior isn't one of them. 
---
Side note: I just love seeing mage flairs try and have an opinion on the difficulty of getting gold.
---
Any proof that it's lagging the chat server?  Guessing not.
---
we pug 5-8 people every week for MC, 
---
I think we need 2 hunters for the tranq shot cd and just more dps
---
We dont flask because "they are too expensive"
---
I dont recruit the pugs, the raid leader does and he is well aware of this situation he just takes whatever he can get tho lol
---
as Hemo you are better off going Swords, but you can use a dagger build with improved backstab/ambush instead, really depends on what weapons you have.  If you're specifically going Hemo you should be using a sword(or mace), something slow.  Hemo is easier and offers more control in PvP than daggers, but it's relatively easy to get raid daggers when compared to swords(especially as alliance).
---
Basically if you are running hemo just use a sword/mace.  If you have Perdition's Blade run a dagger build and skip hemo.
---
Just because it doesn’t scale as well as it does for other classes doesn’t mean it isn’t a great stat. Regen also depends on character level. I promise you it’s a top tier stat for leveling. Not to mention how well it scales with improved drain soul.
---
Bullshit you can heal as shadow pretty much everything till raids. And even with some great gear and enchants  probably also some raids.
---
Have you found a version of RDX that works with Classic?
---
Und/
---
/ⁿ*Aquarien 11qq
---
DBM has been an extremely common addon since vanilla and has shaped how raids are designed and features added to the game.
---
I admit DBM in its current state does make things pretty simple for a lot of classic raiding, but I would argue it's *added* to the game a lot more than its taken away. If not for it and similar addons, fights would need to remain very simple or a lot more work would have to go in to providing visual and auditory cues for players to work off.
---
Yikes.
---
In a different comment you said to only trust ironforge.pro, and there the result is similar to wowclassicpopulation
---
Maybe you just need to get off the internet for a little while
---
Yeah scripts and parsing logs are all client side. I could see this causing issues but they would be fixed by turning off the addon and only affect you, not others
---
Why? I think its pretty stupid that I have to redeploy it far away or wait 2 mins to disappear. 
---
I will give this macro a try. Thanks.
---
We'll have BWL out before you have AV exalted though.
---
And I thought their argument was likewise misguided.
---
I'm on board with you though. If classic+ ever hits, the first thing I'd want to see is integration of features people find "practically necessary". 
---
Questie, Some kind of bag/inventory rework, etc.
---
Yep. They k ow they're fucked if they open server transfers. Because I would be willing to bet at least 50% of all pVp servers alliance would peace the fuck out, and then the remaining horde would ragequit due to not having a bunch of carebears to pwn
---
&gt;DBM
---
Its not too impactful on classic because the encounters simplistic, I just have a grudge against that addon because I believe it had a massive impact on fucking up raiding on retail. Because every single raiding encouner had to be designed in mind where Blizz has to assume that 90% of their playerbase has it installed.
---
Its such a powerful addon that it became a borderline "must have" addon. On classic you probably don't need it, but fuck that addon anyways.
---
&gt;cast bars
---
Its not an option to put on castbars in vanilla, and that addon gives massive advantages in PvP for people who have it, vs people who don't. And I don't like the idea of addons being basically mandatory, they should only be customizations at most (one bag, or even sell trash that kind of thing which has basically no impact on the gameplay).
---
That addons hightens your senses (their reasoning for gutting spy) so I would like to see it either removed, or simply made base UI as it was from TBC anyways.
---
&gt;auction addons
---
Because you have to scroll through 100s of single stacks, and those addons are the reason why anything you post below marketprice is insta-bought.
---
They are borderline bots at this point.
---
If you were to post single stacks manually, it would take you 5 minutes. With those addons it takes you like 20 seconds.
---
I always thought it would be nice if every time you were killed with the honorless target debuff up the timer reset and doubled for when you next ressed.
---
Finally gonna get my BRE and Striker's Mark.
---
It is.
---
We don't refuse to use bandages, but in combat every second counts. Bandaging for 6 seconds is a big DPS loss.
---
The south park episode was based off this problem. it was a huge deal back then and now, i.e. warmode.
---
people acting like this is blizzards fault and they need to do something is funny to me.
---
"but this is not how classic was, we want the true clasic xp"
---
im sure you was 60 in the month in vanilla knowing how and where to get all the bis gear.
---
It seems like everyone wants to be the only one that has a right to exploit the 15 year old system.
---
You think you do, but you don't, is starting to ring truer each day.
---
Players: "THE CHAT LAG IS UNACCEPTABLE AND IS RUINING THE GAME."
---
Also players: "Yeah we broke it."
---
I get that people weren't aware of this but still, it's amusing.
---
I actually did never speak to them because I thought that is the case
---
Pretty much, i had a friend who was in a guild pushing servers firsts and the like back in the day and by far he was the worst player out of our group. He was super geared and looked after by the guild because he turned up all the time, was on 24/7 to help, donated heaps to the guild etc but man was he a bad player. I remember he started getting into trouble for it once the guild was trying to get arena teams competitive in TBC
---
Why are they cancerous trash?
---
That's why I enjoy playing with friends. The game becomes way more fun and less a "you are supposed to know X and Y" experience. But do not worry, keep going and you will eventually get it. Just ignore the unpleasant people :)
---
&gt;I figured it was better to play on a PVP server with friends than alone on a PVE.
---
WoW is a game that incentivizes making in-game friends. You'll always find people with whom you enjoy playing more than your friends.
---
&gt;all but 1 of them has quit wow because they're "bored"
---
Same with my friends. The only one who stuck around rerolled an Alliance druid on my server.
---
Where is the step to add salt?
---
Oceanic servers are mostly alliance favoured.
---
They never played their own game. Even if they just read reddit they would have a better understanding of what’s happening in game.
---
That's not something a community can do and if you demand things from Blizzard, they won't do it since they won't screw majority over minority.
---
Faction transfers are actually implemented in classic already since that's a choice not forced on someone.
---
the difference is these are official servers, and "making a name for yourself" has a bit more gravitas to it than it ever could have had on private servers
---
it's dumb and annoying though
---
It's obviously a reupload, yes Grim's PvP videos are 100% from vanilla.
---
It was originally posted here https://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=14112

I just feel like VW doesn't mesh well with dark pact.  It needs what little mana it has for taunts.  I'd rather quickly dispatch 1 mob (2 if you can fear, since you can fear a mob with any pet out) at a time without drinking/eating/bandaging/waiting than take three at once and use resources in between.  Beyond that, I don't fear if I don't have to solo leveling if I'm in an environment where it's too likely for it to aggro other mobs.
---
Hello everyone! I'm on a PVE server and currently levelling a warrior, level 14 at the moment. I'm on an Arms build but unsure if this is the best build for PVE? I don't mind switching to Fury if this would be the optimal spec/build for PVE. I plan on doing dungeons/raids along the way until I hit 60. Appreciate any guidance/tips. Thank you!
---
I wasn't even talking about logs, I said raidlogging. It means only logging in just to raid, then logging off.
---
The game was already figured out, sure it's even more minmaxed now, but it was the same shit back in the day, there was no discovering, there was no learning... bosses were as easy as they are now.
---
Cool idea to get R14 by making your fellow competitors get less honor, OP, I admire you.
---
Battlegrounds will be cross-realmed. Also all this will lead (if it works) to is even more corpse camping because now instead of giving those players an outlet with BGs you are going to force them to continue the same practices. So while your pvp alliance will have a net benefit the rest on the servers will have a continued bloodbath because you ensured that the Horde are forced to keep hunting them. That sounds like a nice profit.
---
I kinda feel His pain.. my IRL friends don’t play much and I feel like the people I play with are cliques or RL friends that I can’t really break into. It’s kinda lame. I felt like the old community was a little more accepting. Maybe I’m just older and don’t like putting up with chads or people who can’t give you the time of day.
---
This is gold
---
Not if the addon is communicating with other players. From the addon page.
---
" addon inspects every player you meet (you should mouseover the player or target him, in inspect range), stores his PvP data in your local database, send this info to other addon users "
---
" data is synced across "RAID", "BATTLEGROUND" and "GUILD" channels, so when you play on BGs you transmit and receive data from your teammates. And all the time you exchange your data with your guildmates. "
---
This addon is either communicating through the game itself or externally (which  I doubt is something Blizzard would allow), it's not only client side. That would kinda defeat the point of the addon.
---
I remember mid-level dungeoning as a healer paladin involved spamming flash of light as hard as I could to keep up with the massive pulls our tank would drag in to get AoE'd. If I let up off that button, it normally meant death.
---
And still I had Warlocks tapping to nothing at the end of every fight, or going on rants about how everybody else sucked if you asked them to be careful about letting their life go too low on a big pull. The worst was when they tried to throw me under the bus for needing to drink so often when they were absorbing so much of my mana and then just standing around.
---
It became a much better experience once I got to raiding, but I *still* encounter warlocks from time to time who feel like healers are their personal battery packs and get really rude about it.
---
Yeah didn't they add it after rezzing in like BC or Wrath? I swear I remember it in High School...
---
THIS
---
It took my party and I 45 minutes to corpse run to BRD...... fun... Might just go play another video game lol
---
i guess, but personally i only play wow so if i unsubscribe i don't game at all
---
Morgan’s vigil is pretty similar? Or do you think you’re getting ganked too much outside the FP?  
---
Searing gorge can be tough but I’ve never found Morgan’s to be too brutal.
---
Op. Dylek and his guild reported my comment and got it removed lmao
---
Go to gnomeregan and use the card access on the panels to learn it
---
Try posting the Lua errors you're getting. The "random numbers" most likely mean something to someone else.
---
This is not true. If the server was 60/40 to start and alliance felt the majority of the bad time, they are much more likely to transfer than horde would be. Waiting in a que and then not being able to farm or dungeon is a lot worse than waiting in que and getting to do those things
---
Lol that's great
---
&gt;DKP system being abused is not DKP's fault, it's the officers
---
&gt;Loot council being abused is totally loot council's fault!!!
---
Nice double standard. Shoo, troll.
---
the fact that paladins are the least played class by a significant margin in classic lends credibility to me and not you. lmao
---
everyone knows they suck
---
yes, paladins are good at PVE raid healing... and that is literally it
---
shamans by contrast CAN raid heal and bring some useful totems.... but they also have amazing off specs for pvp, world farming, lvling, etc etc etc.... 
---
id rather be good at everything than have one fucking role in the game and suck badly at literally everything else, including pvp
---
good horde in pvp just spam purge/dispel so paladins arent nearly as useful as you think they are
---
I just set up my HS in Darnassus. I need most stuff from kalimdor (winterspring farming, Dire maul). If I need to go to EK I just use boat. Second boat is rarely farmed and you can jump earily and run to flymaster. You will be flying to IF before horde even notice.
---
It takes like 5minutes which is less than corpse running to boat and from boat.
---
spy did get carpet bombed at least - i installed it after the nerf, and it still can give an unfair advantage to the people using it, specifically in caves or areas where you would otherwise not be able to see the enemy, they really should have reduced the range in which it works to like 5ft
---
80% of warlock I group stay at 5% life the whole time. I throw some rejuv when I have some mana just to be eated by the next 2 life tap. Please don't be that guy. You life tap, you regen between combats.
---
Stop playing with noob warlock is hard... It's really not a hard class to play, easy gear, easy farm, discount mount so basically the noob friendly class to play.
---
You must be part of the rare warlocks that don't do it. Read the comments.
---
&gt; but I would argue it's added to the game a lot more than its taken away
---
I disagree, I think that addon basically forced Blizzard into making needlessly complex fights because they just have to assume everyone has an addon that tells them what to do anyways.
---
Which means that obviously the fights had to become more "reactive-based" where you have to just dodge a lot of stuff and react quickly instead of overall strategy (which is very much the important thing in vanilla). Some people like that, I personally don't find it that enjoyable.
---
And since Blizzard had to design around that addon, their fights got more and more complex with more and more mechanics, which makes them much harder to design. Which might have had an impact on release schedule (along with other factors such as designing the zones, and god forbid 4 difficulties).
---
So you are saying blizzard is allowing an addon to communicate so much it ruins communication? I feel like that's an oversight on blizzard rather than anything else
---
Depends on how efficient you are at leveling really, the players who are dedicated have probably done the 1-60 before so will be cutting their leveling time to \~7-8 days. All it would have taken it is a small amount on the weeknights and then a couple of long sessions on the weekend. Plus some people took time off for it, i started about a month late but it coincided with a couple of weeks holidays I already had coming up off work so that helped me power through.
---
i made 100g/hr when p2 was announced just doing maraudon due to everyone going crazy for engineering and lips/faps.
---
right now its still 70-80g but you need to have herbalism and mining for that.
---
it's great because you don't even need to respec and can watch twitch while doing it.
---
Oeb and spinal reaper are better than bre for orcs if you are 2h
---
There are 5 pve servers in NA and 13 PVP last I counted.
---
Generally Arms is the best way to progress through levelling, especially as slow 2h's are quite easily obtainable either through quests or dungeons. Plus if you do feel the option to PvP you'll cope better. Fury shines late game.
---
And they are the same for every class. Every role has bad players and players who dislike playing with bad players.
---
Ignorance (not knowing about the addons) or arrogance of not downloading them/wanting to download them are no reasons to squash addons. It's flawed logic, if anything.
---
This type of puristic "it's not included in the game, I do my job worse since I just won't download them, squash the addons Blizz!!!" way of dictating how people should play is stupid.
---
That doesn't seem like a half bad idea
---
ROFL if you think whitemane is better balanced. U less you consider 60/40 to be better balanced.
---
You might have bigger issues than your BiS. Good luck with your PUGs and with therapy.
---
I have SoD and I'm the #1 ranked lock all star on my server (Fluffles - Rattlegore) so it must not be that bad. Don't underestimate the value of +Int and +Stam in raids. I've survived lots of fights by the skin of my teeth and having more int means less tapping and slightly more critting.
---
Reading all these comments, I just think this guy is really uneducated.
---
Feel sorry for him. Go back to school my man! Take some math classes.
---
The community cant do anything. This is how the system works. But if this continues, PvP servers will die. Quickly. 
---
Blizzard has to provide some kind of incentive for people to transfer. Why would I leave Stalagg as Horde? I rarely get ganked. I can farm in relative peace. But if I suddenly had a lengthy queue and Blizz was offering me a faction change to get in instantly, I'd take it.
---
I don't think BGs are going to be the saving grace people think they will be. You have to deal with the imbalance. With so many Alliance transfers, rerolls, and quitters, they still wont be able to farm in common areas without getting killed over and over.
---
Edit: works not worms
---
Yeah I mean, if not constantly striving to achieve maximum efficiency with leveling and actually trying to do things like quest with buddies occasionally (before honor released of course) counts as bad, then yeah I guess I’m a “bad player”. Don’t have to be a dick about it.
---
I get probably about 16 hrs a week on average to play this game which I guess is complete dog shit amount of time to play reading some of the other comments. Makes me regret even thinking I could remotely keep up with all the “average” no-life losers out there who can dump 100+ hour weeks or whatever.
---
In org?
---
Even bringing up Ret and Prot is like saying “Warrior isn’t a good PvP class because they’re not strong if you spec a third of the way down each tree.” No class is good if you spec like an idiot, and I’m not sure why /u/bf4truth thinks a conversation about how strong Paladin is involves avoiding the best PvP spec in the game, Holy.
---
Alright great, just checking. Not familiar with the name, cheers for confirming.
---
Agreed. While we're on the topic, classic + 
---
Booyyyys
---
Saved 100g by being rank 3. It does help.
---
Do you also think tanks shouldnt be able to los pull casters in dungeons?
---
Faction transfers don't do anything as we have seen over the past two months. The dominant faction stays and the least dominant faction leaves if they are allowed to.
---
Stay arms until max level.
---
Ye like he was alliance and listened to people that told him to reroll. As in reroll horde.
---
I got it from running Gnomergan. You need to get a security access Delta card as a drop or buy one off any AH. Then you interact with one of the consoles in the dungeon to receive the recipe.
---
6months is all it takes.
---
oh no, OP rogue less OP so rogue mad
---
So this is still all client side. Considering this is stored in a local database it sounds like it’s using scripts to parse chat/combat logs and stores them locally. Locally being the key term, it’s actually a pretty easy way to update data without hitting a back end.
---
An example of something that would affect the server would be The Who list, which obviously is limited for a reason. You’re basically sending a query, which hits an appropriate repo that then runs the query on their database and returns it. Every part of this process is very taxing if done in mass. 
---
I don’t actually believe the API is allowed to hit any backend which is why they store it locally and use scripts for it
---
Without ruin you're gonna lose far more than 10-15% DPS.
---
He is full of shit. It probably happened to him one time by chance when a couple guilds were bringing their raids into Blackrock for MC or something and he is trying to act like it's that way all the time.
---
2 weeks seems to be the norm. You should still earn DKP though even if you are a trial raider.
---
Blizzard have actually listened to a lot of the playerbase and their opinions about things and have been implementing it here and there for the course of 15 years. You might want to try the result of these changes!
---
Nice one.
---
Heavy leather is used for thorium brotherhood rep, requires 1200 to get from neutral to friendly.
---
For dungeons, robe if the void is a big upgrade over robes of the winter night because the +sp applies to your fire as well, so your aoe hits harder. But if you're just raiding/pvping, i wouldnt waste time and gold making it. T1 robes aren't as good but they have hit% and more raw stats so I'd say they're a suitable substitute as well if you don't have winter night either.
---
Maybe, just maybe ask your fucking guild. Also yes it's pretty normal to try and give as little loot as possible to trials because you don't know them.
---
You don't need to play 6 hours a week day and then 12 hours a weekend....
---
60 in 2 months someone was saying is only 2-3 hours per day average, factor in that most probably would likely aim for 6 hours+ on a saturday and sunday and probably friday nights and it cuts down the commitment needed during the week while working a bunch.
---
The big difference is probably just knowledge and efficiency with leveling, some of the people i see calling out "no lifers" leveling too fast then say they have like 12 days played and are only in the 40s. Which is fine if you want to go slow and not rush but it's not comparable to how the more hardcore players look to level.
---
Mb that's correct
---
DKP system isn't being "abused" because someone showed up and got DKP.  If someone bad shows up it's because you invited someone bad.  There is no direct connection to the DKP system.
---
If your officers misuse the loot council that is a direct fault with the loot council.
---
I'm not a troll because I didn't want to explain it to someone missing the obvious.  It's not that I have a double standard.  Just like you don't have a double standard.  You're just not smart.
---
I did my first "tank for hire" service today. It was just simple arena/angerforge runs. I charged 5G/run.
---
20G later, this was easily the fastest, trouble-free, and lucrative thing in quite some time I've done. And not to mention the various pieces of loot picked up during the run - all that added up quick and now that I'm bitten, I don't think I'm going to do any more solo-farming of my own anymore.
---
I received one whisper from someone, somewhat antagonized by my tanking ad. He didn't like the rates I charged for running SM, saying that mages do it faster and for cheaper. I simply replied that I'm actually more focused on 60 dungeons, but prospective customers might be curious on what I charge for other dungeons, so there they are. He calmed down after that and apologized for a somehow antagonistic tone.
---
In any event I think it's time to learn and start doing these jump runs which would be even better.
---
You can do either fury or arms while leveling, its a bit up to preference. I prefer to go fury until somewhere around 35-40, then respec arms. 
---
In endgame raids, fury is better dps, but you shouldn't really take that into consideration while deciding on leveling spec. Endgame raids are very different from leveling and doing dungeons.
---
Ally lock is pretty fucking difficult tbh
---
We don't use DKP, we use RCLootcouncil
---
Its almost like you have no point and dont like my opinion.
---
I mean.. most fights in vanilla are pretty much tank and spank. Techniques tend to be "hit that guy until adds, then hit them". Or "Hit the adds then that guy". Things get a lot more complex and interesting with all the differences that have been added over the years. 
---
Not only that, addons for fights like Baron Geddon for the bomb etc were made really early on, etc. They're really nothing new at all.
---
I am curious though, what would an interesting fight be for you without cues such as the ones given by DBM?
---
tickets are 100% prioritized, there's examples in this sub of &lt;10 min response times for gamebreaking bugs
---
What? Ragnaros was killed six days after release in classic. He lived almost 6 months from the release of vanilla, which was several months after guilds first started raiding MC. Less than 100 guilds world wide ever cleared Naxx before pre-patch, I imagine it will be significantly more than that this time around.
---
Mechanically they might still be the same, but overall game knowledge and player reliability are significantly higher.
---
Morgan’s vigil is camped a lot on Herod but I’ve only ever seen people at the red ridge path once
---
Oh I'd be using it strictly for pvp. I already have most of what I'd want from raiding.
---
The point of faction transfers was to prevent the least dominant faction to leave though. I mean, the fact they left has worsened the expected balance and led to situation we have now.
---
I'll check it out, thanks!
---
I dont really care
---
1. Wasn't clear. People debated over this until layers were officially gone. Some still do debate it.
---
2. Ties in with #1. Some people thought removing layers would bring population down to Vanilla levels.
---
3. False. They said there would be server transfers (patch 1.12 had them) at some point, but weren't sure when.
---
Reality :
---
* Players rolled PvP because they played on PvP servers in Vanilla and every other expansion. World PvP wasn't ever this bad.
---
* You can't expect people to keep up to date with every Classic podcast or discussion. And even if you did, people mostly just warned about Flight Path ganking and Un'Goro mafia. The reality played out differently. Un'Goro mafia was not really a thing on most servers. Ganking is not limited to flight paths; it's zone wide.
---
* There was no timeline for PvP release. Most people expected Honor system somewhere around December. They announced it at Blizzcon giving players only 2 weeks to hit 60. Hitting 60 by mid November is the equivalent of 20 hours a week on average. That's a part-time job.
---
Spam that spell! Extra travel is so freaking strong. Even just 8% move speed is massive
---
Which has no bearing at all. Since each player is also a source of income and thus budget for support staff.
---
they were probably unaware you could get one from innkeeper as well
---
PvE can be fun but that's not the WoW experience I want. I love PvP servers because of the added sense of danger, the unpredictable human interactions.  When you see red words come over the horizon,  are you about to die? Maybe they'll pass by? Maybe you'll even make a cross faction homie.
---
Hasn't been the case with honor, now,  though.  Now it's just a shit show of camping and bullshit. I'm not sure why it's so different than when honor debuted in vanilla, but it wasn't like this back then. Not nearly this bad, at least.
---
I had a lock doing this in ZF. He called me out on him being at 50% health for two minutes. I'm like, dood, I'm a Ret Paladin in quest greens. You didn't die, my job is done. He called me bad and left the party.
---
I've a macro for Feign Death that yells "WHY DIDN'T YOU HELP ME????"
---
People get confused
---
Ran it without a tank the other day, was surprisingly smooth but most of us are raid geared.
---
I think “NO CHANGES” was a great way to convey what the general idea was that players wanted, but it doesn’t make total sense. I think a lot of it has died down now that people are actually playing. I do find it extremely stupid when people still say it, but I feel like it’s mostly said ironically now
---
The time between honor and bgs was short. bgs were released before people realized that death squads camping everything was the best thing to do. it was not like today where people get together death squads and camp every possible spot.
---
Well I don't wanna make the impression that I'm greedy or hasty y'know. But I've never been in a raiding guild before so I dunno how this works. And yeah that makes sense, just wanna make sure this isn't a months kind of deal.
---
That was on a K3 private server just before classic. It was 50/50 mostly due to that there was no choice. One realm and only PvP. Even with such ratio at some point Alliance also started participating way less in PvP and in War Effort to a point that the autocomplete system had to start working. TBC private server have it way way extreeme having to offer like 4x exp rate and other bonuses for Alliance so that it's not 90/10 or worse :D
---
If you would launch Classic as a cluster of flexible realms and only PvP then you could get like 60/40 or 55/45 in terms of active players, but PvP would not reflect that. If a realm would be capped to 2-4K players then even with unfavorable ratio the game would be playable.
---
Mobs can burn you too even while in a feral form
---
No.  Not when you only play classic it doesn’t.
---
Right? Shitting on people for wanting to connect with others is, in itself, sadder and lonelier than the person looking for connections.
---
" typical of this sub, you all assume you speak for the vast majority"
---
Followed by:
---
"Its just so funny seeing so many people people complain about a situation they knew could happen"
---
How are you this stupid lol
---
Yeah, I'm not trying to take a stand or anything. If I fails they'll just say "we told you so" and move on. I just wasnt having fun so I stopped the reoccurring sub. Still have 3wks of gametime though so we'll see if BGs have an impact.
---
unfortunately firemaw horde is full
---
Spending our money?
---
Seriously lol. You can't out play the "no lifer" players in this game.
---
Rag was killed in 5 months in vanilla, and for a couple of reasons: levelling is one of the things that got perfected the most over the years; people play good classes/specs more than shitty ones; the encounter was bugged as fuck; and the BIGGEST reason it was "harder" it's because it wasn't 1.12 (or 1.13 like it's in classic, for that matter), classes changed a lot in the duration of vanilla.
---
Don't even get me started on the amount of people that actually killed rag in the first week, let alone the second week. It's probably even lower than the amount of people that cleared a wing in Naxx.
---
Because the raid leader said don’t pull the surger.  Did you have your sound on?  Dps pulled and got wrecked.  End of story.
---
My view is, ask any customer who has paid for tanking services before. I'm not seeing these people chime in and would love to hear their side of the story here.
---
Because if they got what they wanted, and they would have otherwise waited(or have waited) upwarded of 45 minutes just to get a run going...that speaks to the scarcity of tanks, especially when it's the weekend or otherwise off-hours...
---
&gt; If a realm would be capped to 2-4K players then even with unfavorable ratio the game would be playable
---
not for long
---
that isnt enough ppl to sustain the MMO elements of the game
---
dead server is the fastest killer
---
Show us on the doll where the bad rogue touched you.
---
wellp thats what the guild leader said.. When i said we should just flask up and clear oursleves he said "flasks are too expensive dude they are like 100-150 a pop"
---
Be happy you got one of them, i've seen 3 mage blades and 2 staffs and am yet to win any.
---
In my guild its usally 3 weeks might be less if you are active and help people and make sure you have the best gear you can, enchant it etc.
---
Tried this earlier tonight, still took me 20 min and 7 deaths to get to UBRS on one of the relatively less imbalanced EU servers. Might be better outside prime time and if you get lucky and avoid the gank squads roaming Burning Steppes tho.
---
All these addons were in Vanilla. At the rate you want addons gone they might as well just disable addons completely.
---
I appreciate you telling them to look at the code, but many people won't read and understand it apart from someone else telling them what it does. They heard someone else mention it so it must be true
---
I wish you were right, but the sharp rise in homophobia in particular had been striking
---
Yeah it's why I prefer a loot council system than rolling.  As long as they're not super biased/play favorites it usually works out.  Losing every roll sucks :(
---
My broken tooth pet is named Waffles btw :P
---
&gt;Pull your fucking head out and realise that add-ons are a customization extension to the game, and don't need to be incorporated in the standard ui.
---
But if they are "must have" type of addons, why should shouldn't they just be incorporated into the standard UI if everyone is using them anyways?
---
Its a few people who gets screwed over by not having them be baseline.
---
I have it installed and was coping 60-90 second chat lag last night on Arugal.
---
Filthy casuals
---
paladins are just bad dude, everyone knows it, look at the player rate in classic now that everyone knows that
---
unless you want to solely go hardcore into PVE raid healing, there is 0 reason to roll a paladin
---
everyone knowing the game is also why mages are like 30% of the playerbase right now... everyone knows theyre too good at too many things
---
Imagine being this salty.
---
It's basically the same on Firemaw-EU. People who weren't online for 4 days sitting on 150k+ honor this week. I hope everyone involved in this gets their honor reset to 0 and a ban. But who am i kidding? It's Blizzard.
---
sounds like you dont have much time to play a game atall, nevermind taking the time out of your insane schedule to complain about it.
---
Rogue does that well. It's almost exactly like Sion. You go in, stun, and then try to do as much damage as possible while they're stunned.
---
Can't blame dbm for retail raiding to have lfr, normal, heroic, and mythic unfortunately. Also weakauras I think arguably contribute more to how complex mythic fights have to become, with the wizard type things people write
---
People mostly did the same things as now just in fewer numbers.
---
The big difference is the gear got buffed at some point after the honor system came out.  It wasn't worth the grind for level 58 blues.  This means a lot less people cared about "ranking" at the beginning before battlegrounds and the buffed gear came out.
---
We also had 1/4 as many people playing on each server at the same time.  Sure there was a lot of PvP but it wasn't as constant as it is now with a bunch more people on every server.
---
So basically better rewards and a larger server population are the main differences compared to back in vanilla.
---
show me on the rogue doll where spy touched you LMAO
---
&gt; At the rate you want addons gone they might as well just disable addons completely.
---
Yeah, that would be ideal.
---
On balanced servers it's harder for bad players to pretend they don't suck. If their faction is dominating they can camp FPs. If their faction is being obliterated they can hide in capitals and bitch about Blizzard's mistakes. On balanced servers the expectation is that they will kill enemy players. 
---
Lowbies on boats are enemy players.
---
Lol this is funny. Not relevant to me as a lock but I like the editing! Nice chuckle!
---
Doesn't hurt to say you're new. I did that all the time and there was always a more experienced dps who could guide you by marking skull targets so at least you'd know which pack to pull next. After a run or 2 youll learn the dungeon and will be a master in no time. Also don't be afraid to tell to slow down on dps so you can get aggro. You're the dungeon leader essentially! 
---
As for spec, I started off as deep prot/arms as it made life a lot easier with shield slam/tactical mastery. But once yourre geared enough you can go fury/prot or fury/arms even.
---
Lol same.
---
I do not have it installed and get no chat lag at any time on Westfall.  For what that's worth.
---
Because a lot of classic players are coming from retail. For better or worse every class has some form of sustain in retail, first aid is pretty useless.
---
Don't be a pleb. Free action potion and dip out. I'm tired of seeing players just whine and bitch when all they really need to do is out play the other faction. Also, the video creator uses spy add-on so , to me, he's a worthless player. Good players don't need spy.
---
Blizzard doesn't give a F about WoW classic issues please understand this. They would have alot to fix to even bother with this... they are putting they're effort on overwatch 2 and other games now.. sadly but true
---
It's a product of batching that is known and not viewed as a bug, but as a feature of vanilla.
---
They should be compensated because they need nothing from the dungeon. Why should they run some random 5 man they don't need?
---
Thx for the renew!!  Love it!
---
Lol I got down voted for answering a question honestly. Love you reddit.
---
Blizzard does tons wrong, the problem I have is placing that blame too specifically and were it doesn't belong. When they laid off that supports staff Hots just failed, hearthstone had lost its lead Dev and was bleeding players, WoW was under 1mil active subscribers in North America, SC2/D3 were dead as far as selling copies go, and to top it all off Classic wasn't looking like it was going to save the company. 
---
If you think you're going to have 20% less revenue next year compared to this year you need to get ahead of it and cut costs or go out of business. 
---
Sure they were wrong about classic, but they weren't wrong as far as the whole company and its IP. 
---
D4 and overwatch 2 are still a long ways off, same with the next wow expac. So they can't expect massive sales to keep revenue up.
---
Funny seeing everyone saying blizzard is such a big company and has so much money, but Blizzard was an indie studio until WoW launched. They just had one main team that would bounce from game to game. WoW coming out gave them the revenue to have multiple teams working on different projects congruently. But WoW revenue has been drying up more every year. 
---
Wouldn't be shocked if more cuts were coming.
---
Yeah. I was more talking about how it has made encounter deaign progress to a point where there are no tells or telegraphs to show you what a boss is going to do because some guy with an add on timed it and put it in his add on. Blizzard must designn encounters around knowing the majoriry of people have it with how they overlap "one shot mechanics" for bosses.
---
I find boss timers one of the worst addons in wow. Worse than any groupfinder, single handedly made encounter devs lazy.
---
I guess "fun detected fun nerfed" started early? That settles it, thanks!
---
Gathering professions are best for money IMO. Alchemists (all crafting professions tbh) tend to operate on a small profit margin. If I wasn't already maxed at enchanting/tailoring I'd go mining/herbing to supplement solo dungeon farm gold. 
---
Side note, engineering is hugely beneficial in PvP but if you're not a hardcore player or just don't want to waste money on engineering, it's not worth it.
---
Wow it’s almost 2020 and people still care about guild?
---
No one is asking you to bandage in combat. If you are fighting something the healer is responsible for your health, as soon as that something dies, the healer is no longer responsible for your health. Eat, bandage, heal yourself.
---
Someone’s dad has to work at blizz
---
I don't really understand how his comment was salty
---
Just dip, leader is a moron or your players are bad. Next week we are doing a 24 man with flask for people who are wanting to farm flask and then 2 32 man no flasks... If your guild is struggling that hard with MC then it's not worth staying in, imagine how much of a shitshow BWL will be with that guild. Do people die/fail mechanics and not get held accountable so they can improve?
---
I used my VW to 60, succ kills faster but found VW better for chaining a bunch of mobs. I'd give him time to aggro on the very first mob, then he'd lose it about 50% I'd send him off to the next mob while i finish off the first and repeat. Throw in a third mob with dots and fear if there's room. My mana lasted ages still in a drain spec, I left taunt on auto. I was wearing that +shadow damage crafted set as soon as possible.
---
If lose my batch it’ll be nicer around the house, but who will sleep with me then!?
---
Not like any of us are going outside or anything.
---
People have to learn somehow, and even vanilla veterans may not have seen the precise details of content in years. I've definitely heard my fair share of "yeah I've done this... 15 years ago". Honestly even just group composition can be big for the dynamics of a team. I feel like warriors, paladins, and druids each have their own variations to keep in mind for how tanking and pulls go (e.g. one trend I've noticed in particular is that paladins have great AoE threat generation but few options if they NEED to effectively taunt). Double paladin teams have definitely been interesting too given the hybrid stuff and various blessings. Just recently we tried to get through Lyceum with such a group, hoping to rely on consecration AoE. It just didn't quite work IMO, in contrast to a different group with a single mage that pretty much singlehandedly AoE'd Lyceum down after the tank grouped up as necessary.
---
That was kinda...his point, although you made a good point on the jump runs thing. He was just trying to explain why he has to sell tanking services(doesn't have many other efficient ways) but maybe he doesn't do jump runs.
---
I trialed for my guild for 2 weeks before becoming part of the core raiding team. Earned DKP while trialing and was able to start spending when I promoted. Seems fair to me
---
We're on Bigglesworth, my man.
---
I do the same. Usually don’t have issues with the healer continuing to heal me tho. They usually loved being told not to worry about me
---
Nice one Cosby
---
Thx for this.
---
Probably because they were added in patch 1.6 which is BWL patch.
---
It deserves part of the blame, as an addon that allows you to play with your brain turned off, and thus forcing Blizz to spend a lot more time on designing unecessary complicated boss encounters just to compensate for that addon being used by everyone.
---
Need spaces
---
Yes, from any satyr type mob above level 50, including dungeon mobs and bosses. Any mob that drops demonic runes, drops felcloth.
---
fake it till you make it. 
---
As far as what to pull you just pull the least amount of mobs to get to the destination.
---
The light doesn't really feel like a good fit for trolls (ritualistic and shamanistic people) and forsaken (I mean the shadow sure, but the light?  They abominations.) and I am all about that.
---
If we had started with the burning crusade I would have made a blood elf day 1.  Their interaction with the light is the most interesting.
---
...yeah I like being a holy vessel.
---
Yep love the reference.   
---
For anyone who hasn't seen it this is from the first Dumb and Dumber movie. The context of this scene is that they were driving through mountains in the snow and ice on a scooter because their car broke down, and were both completely frozen when they arrived. Jeff daniels (guy on the left) is complaining how cold his hands are. Jim carrey says he can have his extra pair of gloves that his hands are getting sweaty cause he's wearing like 3 layers of gloves and Jeff Daniels gets fucking pissed he had extra gloves this whole time and didn't say anything.
---
Battleshout is going to just eat a gcd.  You can’t get around that.  Using the rage you get from charge before swapping into defensive gives it to you for free at the start of the fight. Next gcd is on blood rage.  Both of which give you aoe aggro, bs more than be though.   If you don’t have battle shout up all the time you’re not generating as much threat from your autos which is the whole point of going fury prot.  And since you will get at least a mh and 2 oh swings in during the two gcds, you should be in a good position before the first sunder.  Not to mention blood rage gives you the rage to use sunder guaranteed when the gcd is up.
---
Of course BGs will have a lot of impact: ganking will happen only during queues and you need to visit capital for requeue.
---
My strategy while levelling was shadowbolt, immolate, CoA, Corruption and then wanding until the mob dies. Spirit has been pretty decent while levelling up until somewhere in level 40.
---
Grats on 300.
---
Point. If you only want to play classic, it looks grim.
---
Ah, which guild am i in again?
---
Issue started being widespread 4 to 5 days ago, honorspys been in for over 3 weeks 🤔
---
Welcome Kitkat!
---
You keep focusing on 1/5the the work but the tank doesn't need the 5man. In the scenario we are talking about he is being asked to do something he doesn't need. Why would he do it if there is NOTHING in it for him? Give him greens y'all were just gonna vendor and it becomes worth his time.
---
The streamer hate train is bigdickenergy Yuge man #killallstreamers still trending the Killallstreamers guilds are alive and well and constantly on the lookout for streamers to roflstomp and teabag till the end of time.
---
I see the text there on the screen, but I can hear the words that he's saying. I watched this movie so many times.
---
Well, I played on K3 with 6K at launch and then 3K peak. It was easily playable and my resto sham could make and sell endless amounts of FAPs and other pots as amount of workers was just right (a.k.a. never enough). During pre-AQ event Alliance camped one cultist camp, Horde the other while the third/whatever was a no-man zone with skirmishes here and there. Not enough players to overwhelm the server nor not enough to camp every flight point or every popular path.
---
Legit 10 min chat latency for me earlier tonight lol, it was crazy.
---
[This is why.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqHrQAbbUeA#t=10)
---
(until they fucked everything up, at least)
---
Well let’s just face it guys. Incendius PvP is basically 2 alliance guys get shit on by two horde guys but they have a hard time counting so they say it was 8. They call for back up and 20 alliance form a cheese ball. Now unfortunately for the alliance Horde are a bunch of hungry rats and when they smell a cheese ball they collect into what as known as the: “Horde Rat Ball” now the horde eat ball nibbles and eats the entire alliance cheese ball until there is nothing left. The the cheese goes back into iron forge and talks about how there were 24678 horde and they fought bravely as 10

So how is he able to instantly make all the mages scattered all around him, well out of follow-range, make him follow again without something illegal?
---
S m a ll m e n
---
This will be the downfall of classic, tnx to gankers :)
---
Ahhh, you arent concidering improved shadowbolt uptime
---
Ah, I haven't played retail since wotlk.
---
Doesn't it only scale 33%? So 120 spell damage would only increase consecration's damage by 5 damage per tick.
---
Nice! Not sure why I even checked, Smolderweb hasn't had a single queue since launch day lol.
---
It's not 10s of thousands of players sending out honorspy messages, jfc people
---
litterally no brain
---
Well at least, this is the kind of wPvP that I like. There's actually a real purpose behind it instead of artificial murder points.
---
That's not pservers fault per se, the whole community mentality has changed to minmaxing attitude.
---
They want to rank high and to do so, no other choice than to gank. BGs will change the situation and Blizzard already catered to complaints by launching it earlier than planned.
---
At what point do people start asking for refunds?
---
i have no idea lol
---
the only thing that would make me come back into the game
---
Have you looked at the data? People are barely running a census multiple times a *week* for wowclassicpop, much less multiple times on raid reset day. Obviously Ironforge isn't accurate for numbers, but I think it paints a pretty good picture of H:A ratio as each faction is probably relatively similar in percentage of guilds who care enough to log their raids.
---
They don’t need healer attention, we solo just fine without a healer. Throw a HoT on and call it a day, if lock pulls aggro that’s his fault.
---
You are so right. 
---
They totally don't want lots of free money on a 15 year old game, that requires no new development. 
---
I was confused and a little disgusted before figuring out what ass candy was.
---
It's a shame they don't use DKP system. For us a trial gets DKP but isn't allowed to bid on any loot which has a bid from a raider until he has 400 which is roughly 3 weeks or so, then he can use these DKP to start his bids.
---
In fact, any guild which has the nerve to call itself semi-hardcore should have all rules stated on their website or at least their discord, ready for new people to read.
---
So cross server battlegrounds huh?
---
Sounds unlikely. As far as I know, addon messages should be limited by amount in a given time frame. Maybe that broke, but still a bug on Blizzard's part.
---
Why are people so stupid, dont they understand when blizz see the reduction in subs, less rescources on developing Wow Classic. Maybe we wont even see ZG, AQ and Naxx:(
---
Same on my lock. And they heal me anyway. Wasting the Siphon Life I've got spread out amongst the trash...
---
I'd rather avoid this guild and join DKP one instead.
---
first dk*
---
Its not the warrior class discord and never claimed to be. 
---
There is another warrior class discord that you can go to and get the same low quality information you see in most of the class discords :)
---
I appreciate it, don't let these assholes get you down.
---
You quoted me twice without adding any input of your own. Ill make your argument for you. You act like the whole wow community is on here. You’re wrong lol.
---
Why is this not at the top?
---
That’s fair! Yeah I mean tbh I’m coming from a place of being a rogue (with preparation). A lot of other classes obviously have much worse experiences in the normal routes.
---
There will be at least 100 ppl a server playing all day long and make sure they have rank 14
---
And then 10 ppl make sure their char is played 24/7 cap below them
---
In the end all others will be so far away form max ranks then that they don’t even get rank 13 you will see that.. half the ppl trying 14 will end up with a mount at rank 11
---
Totally agree. Like I said, I don't think anyone is obligated to carry anyone, but I feel like guilds should schedule BiS and attunment runs the same way they do raids. It helps everyone. If there are officers willing help that's awesome and I think they should also be willing to lead people through content they aren't familiar with. That's just me. It's also why I don't run a guild, I'd spend all my time helping people. I see both sides, but I also see lots of spam guilds shit on people and take advantage of them while also not doing anything to support their members.
---
Druids can't even see how much mana they have in bear/cat form without addons lol
---
Dwarves are my favorite fantasy race.  Night elves look like purple bunny people.
---
You're also comparing clicking 1 button to tanking a whole 5man in a pug. I'm not sure if you've ever tanked pugs, but it's usually a headache. It usually takes an hour of your time minimum.
---
 We should just run 5mans we need nothing from in order to help random people for no reason?? I just don't understand your thinking. The tanks would just do something better with their time that Benifits them
---
Pointing out specific code is a much better, and believable than copy pasting text from the add-on page that doesn't mean much.      
---
For example. This broadcast on death, https://github.com/kakysha/HonorSpy/blob/ffe5323f5e86e49a1358a025986645f32f5e9d11/honorspy.lua#L445    
---
So when there's a channel to sync on, it'll sync at most every 60 minutes (I believe the getservertime is in seconds from a quick google, which is then compared to 60*60 which means every 3600 seconds or every 60minutes). Or every 10 minutes if there isn't a sync channel, so across your group or raid or guild.        
---
It also won't broadcast for every player, only ones that would meet the criteria for getting any points for the week.
---
You'd be surprised how often this works.
---
Could you imagine if this was next lvl NPC AI.
---
A sense of real danger and no predictive behavior or pathing
---
Everytime something bad happens on that server, God saves a puppy.
---
Who are you quoting? Again, care to explain why the system isn't garbage?
---
Focus, kid. This isn't rocket science.
---
LOL. Just because the raid leader said that doesn't absolve him of responsibility. He made that call wayyyy too fucking late. That surger was already pulled. Even if all 40 of them moved back immediately after the call, the surger would have caught them because it moves faster than 108% character speed. 
---
The RL fucked up by letting his group get that far down the tunnel before doing top-offs/rebuffs after Garr, assuming his intent was to get that done before killing the Surger (which it clearly was based on his language in the video). The Tank fucked up by not recognizing the RLs bad call and staying in position at the front.
---
We have the loot rules stated in the discord. We just don't use DKP.
---
Could someone explain how honor farming would even work? You can only get 500 rp per person each day so you'd need too many involved imo. This looks like a video of them ganking ppl...
---
Move guild.
---
Wot every zone is dominated by apes and saladbakers
---
Eh. For me, wands are for trash mobs after you've dotted them all up. Only on bosses will I go full bore...
---
Yesterday I tried to join a UBRS group that needed “dps with a key”. Once they invited me the RL goes “I hope you don’t need the shoulders or Rend’s weapons” 
---
I explained that I only needed Rend’s MH. He then goes “ok well both swords are on reserve.” I laughed and said ok good luck and left. He then whispered me and said he would give me two gold to open the door. I declined. 
---
I then started my own UBRS group and started advertising as “Need more for UBRS all roles, nothing reserved because that’s not how pugs work” 
---
Got a group super quick and ran past that other group who was still waiting outside for a key. I didn’t get the sword that run but it was still very satisfying.
---
It looks pretty good overall. The PVP cloak has more stam and armor and is available at a fairly low ranking. Other than that, I would probably go with different pants. You give up a lot of spell power running necropile there. I would go with either skyshroud or spiritshroud.
---
The only other thing to consider is the type of PvP you might be doing. It's pretty rare I get to hard cast a shadow bolt in PvP and as a result I feel like % crit loses a lot of it's value. I'd probably run the DM class trinket with the reed and maybe look to replace the helm with the crimson felt hat. If you're doing more group stuff where you can actually get off plenty of shadow bolts then the crit stuff is fine, I've just found that the vast majority of my damage comes from DoTs in pretty much every situation.
---
No idea. From what I understand mostly they expect you to get the max out of your class, get prebis, enchants, etc
---
I did some testing on this yesterday and was able to consistently replicate the issue. The linked aggro table appears to only be an issue with the **mage** load-out for Cho'rush, and in conjunction with the Tier 1 (and presumably tier 2) 5-piece set bonus. I am able to maintain the 5-piece bonus without issue on the shaman and priest load-out.
---
Tested on each load-out by initiating fight, and breaking set bonus between FDs. Each time I had set bonus, aggro tables were linked. Whenever I removed a piece, aggro tables would separate.
---
My guess is that it is an interaction between the inability of the mage load-out to target Gordok (with a heal / shield), and the aura provided by the 5 piece bonus.
---
I like how people still post about #nochanges players opinions mattering, dispite blizzard making a ton of changes and ignoring the #nochanges players
---
I’m the exact opposite. My favorite race is Tauren, but the woodlands of Eastern Kingdoms are so bad ass! Too much desert in Kalimdor.
---
/moo
---
Thank you!!!
---
No, I did not, I said that **not** doing it because "no changes" was invalid. Big difference to claiming "might as well change it because they changed other things". 
---
The entire "no changes" thing applies absolutely nowhere as a reason to not do anything. Ever. At all. How do you not understand this?
---
Are you the guys on the gif??
---
Stares in warrior.
---
Pretty sure most of the horde that does this don’t really care that much about honor gains. They’re just doing it to grief people and be an ass
---
Heavy Runecloth bandages are soooo good. Glad I ignored tailoring to power level my first aid for a while. Makes questing/dungeons so much smokther
---
Go on...
---
Shield them too or their hellfire cast disappears instantly.
---
They don't. I reported people last week and they're still running around the world.
---
If you keep them out of BGs they will just continue to camp you in the open world....
---
You did not really think this through.
---
And they dont carry food/water at all
---
Unless there is a problem caused by it, it shouldn't bother anyone. Locks have a lot of resources to shift their health and mana around. In the mid 40's drain life is at a point that it gives more health than it cost mana so you can generate a surplus of HP by using drain life and life tapping. 
---
I think most healers stress themselves out by trying to keep them topped off. Most likely because they are just getting tunnel vision due to addons and staring at raid frames instead of reading the complete situation. 
---
Unless a lock kills himself or wipes due to the way they are life tapping, they most likely have it under control and aren't being malicious with it. Even if they are, a lock can restore 100% of their mana with like 20% of the healers. As far as conversions go, that's pretty efficient.
---
Might be an unpopular opinion, but what if they killed each other already enough, so they don't give honor anyway and thus they agree to not kill each other. For me that seems like a reasonable approach (I wouldnt even need any external communication for that, just /point /nod and you're done)
---
Only need 1 person to Q, the rest can be wherever
---
When I first got the game I was dead set on being an undead shaman. After looking over the manual a bit more carefully on the drive home, I realized I couldn't do that. 14 year old me decided to say screw the horde and go with alliance at that point. Been that way since then. Familiar just feels safe.
---
RCLootcouncil is basically when loot drops you get a prompt with several options to choose from, such as bis, major upgrade, minor upgrade / offspec, pass. Then based on that they decide who gets loot. DKP is nice but idk if many guilds still use it.
---
I do. I'm also specced into improved shields!
---
Flasks, Greater Fire Protection Potions, Greater Arcane Elixirs, and Mongoose. Buy them every Saturday and Sunday and relist them on Tuesday/Wednesday(unless you're Atiesh Horde, then find a different hustle lmao)
---
I only farmed the first 3 weeks after I hit 60 and now I just log on to raidlog and buy/list and I'm growing my TSM ledger by 10-15% a week. Investing is actually not that good because of inflation but if you flip and always hold your gold in items that are liquid then you can get ahead
---
Yeah who cares.  I'm waiting for bgs anyway
---
I multibox. I play with 7 accounts. I have 7 x 60 on Shazzrah. I will make your corpse camping in open world the best pvp experience you will ever have in wow classic. How? by being present on all servers shazzrah has cross realm with, 1-2 times per hour to promote the boycott. Why ? Because Chaos is a ladder. If Corpse Camping Faction wants to be in leaderboard &gt; go open world and corpse camp. Oh wait, imagine that i will stream it so you can report the boycott :)
---
but you can do mc with 20 people
---
I play on Herod, considering last week there was probably about 4.4k players max in the ranking pool last week for alliance (on reset), no. Fuck even my honorspy on that Monday was only around 3k players, that came from people sharing between my groups and my guild that were inspected, which obviously enough I was missing a bunch.        
---
But yes across all servers sure, there would be. BUT server A lagging shouldn't have any effect on server B, unless there's some overall issue. It'd be like because stormwind is lagging on faerlina it should be lagging on Herod lol
---
Poop sock? Just pancake it on your chair.
---
What's the trick with defias brotherhood quest chain? I got to the part where I escort the traitor, when he got to the barn entrance he just disappeared, and quest didn't complete. ~~I went back to the tower, nothing there. Abandoned quest, now I can't pick it up again because the traitor isn't there. Am I stuck now?~~ Ok traitor respawns as it is an escort. Gona try again now...
---
e: seems there's some weirdness with escort quests in party, I was able to accept the quest but the escort didn't start for me.
---
Haven't had much opportunity to be helpful unfortunately as the guild seems not too active except around raid times. Which I guess is more a problem with Classic in general, many people are just raid logging because there's nothing else to do atm.
---
You clearly should have formed a raid group to get on the boat
---
Swimming up the waterfalls in feralas.
---
While I would generally agree with this statement, if you are 80% mana and just chilling it’s kind of stupid to watch me cannibalize, lufetap, first aid and than run back. Some groups zoom and if you have the spare mana, why not use it? I see some heals who refuse to heal more than a renew on locks even when they have 100% mana.
---
Lmao I bet he's a gnome mage 😅😅😅
---
She indeed will open it every time after you turn in the quest. In addition, the quest rewards are pretty good gear pieces. Not BiS obviously but probably better than what most people currently have equipped around that level.
---
I mean.. if you think dbm allows you to play without your brain on for later mythic boss fights in a current tier, then I don't think anyone could say anything to change your mind. Else we would see a lot more people clearing mythic than there are now
---
Without ! it toggles on and off. ! is supposed to mean "always on" but it doesn't seem to work with wand Shoot.
---
I'd say the mage is better when dungeons are hard, but when you're barrelrolling through it I'd rather have a warlock that never has to drink because neither does the healer. In our scholo runs we're always waiting for the mage to regen while everyone else is just standing around doing nothing.
---
You're still not thinking it through. Addons like DBM open up so much for the game.. I mean any fight that relies on players getting critical information either has to allow an addon to see it *or* be extremely obvious with the information so that players can be expected to spot it.
---
And now you run in to issues of accessibility. The beauty of addons like DBM is they are highly customisable by an individual. Colour blind? No problem! Poor vision? That's cool, make a loud sound and a big flashing bar. Deaf and can't hear teammates or hear visual queues? Got you covered.
---
DBM and similar addons only add to the game. Sure they make certain fights in vanilla pretty trivial but overall I think its contributions have been far more than any kind of detriment. Plus if you don't want to use it.. don't.
---
Because it's only "must have" for the people that choose that type of content.
---
And there is more than one add-on for each use.
---
Inconsequential things could arguably be baseline. Like mob health / % or single bag slot.
---
But again, that changes the base experience for players.
---
Plenty of people raid without dBm and PvP with spy, they aren't "have this add-on or don't play"
---
I bet this gets nerfed faster than chat gets fixed.
---
Time to reroll
---
Only remulos is alliance favored from what I've seen.
---
Do you have a high-ish level character in retail ? If so, you can just solo Vanilla dungeons to learn their layout at your own pace.
---
Can someone explain me the dkp system?
---
I find that lifetapping to the point where your mana and hp is equal than drinking and eating is the best way to go about it.
---
Yeah I’m super new to classic pvp so I’m learning loads after every 1v1, I’ll look down and see I never used intimidating shout or forgot to use a trinket. It’s pretty deep because of all the diff consumables
---
Barrens isn’t a contested zone though..
---
You can fuck with other people's honorspy btw, people have been doing it on certain servers
---
There is absolutely no way the average player plays this game 6 hours a day
---
Uhhh, what "margin of error"? Margin of error is a statistical term with an objective mathematical meaning, you can't just say margin of error when you are wrong and hand wave away you being wrong. 
---
What's the actual margin of error for this survey?
---
Or because they played horde in classic? 
---
Or because they like like the models?
---
Personally I think the alliance models look like shit. Wouldn't wanna stare at that for years.
---
Never ever double tap. It's almost always a wasteful and dangerous way to recover mana. I've seen so many clips of warlocks in MC tapping 2-3 times and then get one-shot by one of the RNG abilities in there. Always try and keep a fair balance between health and mana.
---
Lmao. 
---
So you don’t want an answer. You just want to be told exactly what you want to hear.
---
We're lacking some information for that assumption. All i know from OP is hunters been there for ages and stuff is lost every week to pugs. Effort is something we are unaware of.
---
Okay I get it, you think the system is garbage and nobody else should be allowed to enjoy it, it must be changed.
---
I ask you again, why did you roll PvP if you think this way? If you want fair fights then play PvE and do BGs.
---
Horde and enjoying the game. That is all.
---
Yeah it definitely varies, my guild has a good mix of PvP, PvE, and raid loggers.
---
If your guild is only raid logging when you want to do other stuff, it might not hurt to find a new guild while you are still a trial.
---
Earn points for raiding and killing bosses, use points to buy loot.
---
Is cooperating with the other faction against the ToS or something?
---
Most good tanks don't even tank for pugs. There is just no incentive to, too many bad players out there to waste your limited playtime like that. If you just hit 60 and are looking to farm prebis JOIN A GOOD GUILD EVEN IF THEY DON'T HAVE A RAID SPOT. 
---
Spending time effectively  on this game is just as much about the people you know in it as what you know about it. I asked our MT the last time he pugged was the other day and he just laughed.
---
I respect your opinion but will continue to make yall mad lmao
---
both factions camp, grief, and gank lowbies. but im horde and even i recognize that its harder on alliance because theres more of us on basically every pvp server.
---
with that being said you are right the constant horde bashing is stupid and childish but i guess thats expected in wow
---
Seems pretty good when you're frost nova'd and watching a mage cast a big arsed spell to kill you.
---
Dps shitters is the key problem. It's a fucking joy to tank for a well oiled machine of a grp. Tongues on casters, rogues controlling a mob, a ret pala that knows how to chuck in a heal, a shaman than use grounding. Tanking for shitters is like playing retail.
---
You can't gauge whether he feels sorry for the guy, or whether he is 'shitting on' the guy from what he posted. Relax and assume the best brother
---
I'm Alliance on Herod.
---
My main is mining engineering so I have a lot of materials already, I do like the utility though, portal to Kalimdor is amazing in and of itself. I hated leveling mining and with wPVP I’m imagining competition for nodes to be even worse, surely herbalism would be just as bad? How annoying is both considering that the minimap can only show 1?
---
Then I don't care that me using spy makes you not have fun, obviously lol
---
I wish there was an add-on where you could rate other players' performance after a dungeon, then people would have to perform and be nice or they would have trouble finding groups
---
they can drop from target dummies
---
How was that aggressive and being a dick? Jesus you're soft. Also I'm sure this guy is really sick of people spreading blatant misinformation about a project he contributed to and then having to defend it over and over while the posts and comments get up voted.
---
Or anything within 50, which was the entire point. You're kinda slow huh?
---
A single part of this MASSIVE Game. This guy sure is screwed!
---
Why else would he want people to stop using a simple addon?
---
Kill boss, earn points, points with which you bid on and win item drops by being either the person with the most (static price system) or the one willing to spend the most (auction system).
---
I've reported the same name in retail about 20 times and it's never banned. They won't even ban the name from being used. Great example of Blizzard not caring as long as it drives subscriptions. There is a delicate balance here because if they ban them too quick then they won't get the additional revenue from the exploiters forcing innocent people into buying new accounts. Cha-ching!
---
On my server redridge FP and the zoneline to steppes are camped, with people patrolling the south wall of steppes as well.
---
If they used dkp I’m sure it would be fair.

---
well private servers also suck shit, so there's that
---
Arguable if there are any rogues camping the bridge from burning steppes
---
Yep already told them I'm quitting cause playing alliance was a stupid idea. BUT NO STORMWIND LOOKS SO MUCH COOLER THEN OGRIMAR!!!
---
Awesome, I look forward to it! Where would I go about finding it?
---
So nothing changes. I dont want an empty world. I want them to wait...and count...and cry...and whine...thats it.
---
You don't really need them until you're in the 50+ range, as drain life/siphon life are sufficient healing to offset life tap. After that point its real cheap/easy to just buy the mats you need to level first aid.
---
These rules are expected to include the answer to your question also.
---
Someone apparently set up just such a summoning service on one of the servers. Parked a warlock and two alts at all the most popular travel destinations.
---
Or on my server they simply just keep running away until they have reinforcements show up. I’ve seen a 20 man horde raid turn into 80 horde in less than 15 minutes when we decided enough was enough and went to camp them for a little bit.
---
Could kill demons in winterspfing for eyes of shadow or dragonkin in winterspring for blue sinew
---
Except in Vanilla (where I was a MT) this was NOT the case.  I dont play warrior now but you got me so intrigued I want to look into it
---
The chat lag is due to an add on isn't it?
---
Trash humans at it again
---
Except when I always tell the healers that I'm fine and restoring my own hp is part of my rotation as is sacrificing part of it for mana,  Yet they always insist on throwing heals my way.
---
No idea as there are no official numbers out there.
---
Ok
---
So people on your server don't use any forms of cc?
---
Nothing to do with gearscore. 
---
They just had pretty much every single lvl 80 in a single location.
---
Adding onto the first point: make sure you have all three (Curse of Elements, Shadow, and Recklessness). Did an MC guild run last night but our usual locks were busy with the holidays. Asked a pug to throw Elements on, to which he replied that he was a warlock, not a mage. I explained what Curse of Elements was, and he didn't have any curses aside from Agony.
---
Don't be that guy.
---
I'm sorry, you're right.
---
 My next post will be about implementing [faction queue](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e314v9/put_faction_queues_in/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link).
---
Not sure why you’re gatekeeping a potentially helpful tip here.
---
Thanks :D
---
I looked up guides for dungeons before tanking them for the first time. Thraex on YouTube has some good ones.
---
I'd strongly advice against speccing fury. Fury tanking is for maximizing single target threat (IE raiding). You don't get Tactical Mastery, which means you can't stance dance to use Mocking Blow or Intercept. You also don't get Concussion Blow or Improved Taunt which are both very helpful for controlling multiple mobs.
---
Definitely save your money for an epic mount.
---
“the least dominant faction leaves if they are allowed to“
---
...or rerolls/quits/raidlogs if not, so from pvp perspective they may as well have left.
---
It’s honor spy
---
They aren’t honor trading? They’re just not killing each other.
---
im not, ive played both i really dont care which one i am it makes no difference
---
&gt;I mean any fight that relies on players getting critical information either has to allow an addon to see it or be extremely obvious with the information so that players can be expected to spot it.
---
Yeah, why shouldn't they register that information themselves? Why do they need an addon for it.
---
Lets say Baron geddon for instance, his living bomb is a really easy mechanic, you don't need an addon for it and people can easily spot it and just call on the VOIP they are using, discord or whatever.
---
Just straight up deleting that addon from the game would make vanilla raid content probably better straight away as people actually had to pay attention to the game  instead of getting text messages on the middle of their screen telling them what to do.
---
&gt; Colour blind? No problem! Poor vision? That's cool, make a loud sound and a big flashing bar. Deaf and can't hear teammates or hear visual queues? Got you covered.
---
Why shouldn't those just be options in the base game? Colorblind mode, have the bosses yell specific phases for certain abilities etc.
---
&gt;DBM and similar addons only add to the game. Sure they make certain fights in vanilla pretty trivial but overall I think its contributions have been far more than any kind of detriment. 
---
I am not convinced, they just make the game trivial imo. Is it handy and useful? Absolutely. But I think it simplifies the mechanics too much, and forces Blizz to make the fights uneedlessly complex to compensate for it.
---
&gt;Plus if you don't want to use it.. don't.
---
In Vanilla, I don't need to use it. But regardless its still the meta to do it, and not using it is self-handicapping.
---
My point is that I think the game would be better without that addon, as the game wasn't designed with that type of addon in mind.
---
I would get the add-on ItemRack 
---
You can keybind and swaps you want to do. You can change every piece of gear with one bind if you wanted to
---
😐 you’re looking too deep into that insult. 
---
But yes, my experience with people who are used to retail is that they don’t understand what the need to be successful in classic. 
---
Not understanding or not carrying about threat management, mana conservation, consumables, and a bit of other stuff on the behalf of those who migrated from retail equate a retail reject.
---
Uh actually there were. I remember camping allies IN Ironforge.
---
You're not replying to OP...
---
No, the reply originally said it was deleted. You said I was ass licking them or something
---
Agreed.
---
Heyo! XD
---
Absolutely. If people clearly don't know what they are doing, I bounce. Not worth my time.
---
Statistically sure, but not all hordes are there to PvP. Mages are more valuable than other classes in massive PVP etc. There are a lot of variables to take into account.
---
Yeah, 60/40 is not ideal, but at least people should have the numbers to put up a fight instead of just rolling over.
---
They already made changes
---
It's fantastic vs frost mages that rely on that freeze to drop their shatter crits.
---
Vancleef didn't kill himself
---
I suppose that's fair, I would just feel terrible about rolling on a piece of gear that's clearly much better for another class than for me. I would at least ask the priest if he needs it, and if he does I'll pass 10/10 times.
---
I've had other classes roll need on my BiS when it's not their BiS too. I don't know, I would feel like a piece of shit   doing that to another player.
---
IMO it's the opposite. If you allow memespecers to join your group then you cannot just cuck them on all the loot. You accept responsibility and distribute fair and evenly. Either you give them loot, or you don't invite them. Can't have it both ways.
---
Spell power, then stam then int. Maybe swap the first two if your pvp focused. Crit is great but not something to prioritize unless your demo spec focused.
---
I started horde because the guy who introduced me to wow was a troll.  Joined his guild and never really played alliance.  I finally rolled a main character on alliance during Wrath for the death knight.  I had other characters on alliance but none I played heavily.
---
Starting again, I chose horde because of the lore and the racial.  Horde lore is fighting for survival.  Alliance is trying to be noble but sweeping atrocities under the rug and looking the other way.  Horde may commit war crimes but they don't pretend it didn't happen and they don't shy away from them either.
---
I agree 100%.
---
not necessarily, check the AH.  medium is selling for 4x the vendor price on AH on my server.
---
Does seduction share diminishing returns with fear or just seduced target is immune to fear?
---
I wish the balance on that server will be restored back to 50-50. :)
---
There is. It’s called google. 
---
“Wow classic warlock stat priority”
---
https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/warlock-dps-pve-stat-priority
---
Buy herbs cheap, sell potions.
---
Imagine being serious about progressing something that was cleared day 6 in greens/blues.
---
&gt;a bannable offence since it was abusing game mechanics , it is not ?
---
Yes but they have enough human GMs to check it, today they are 90% bots.
---
I really wish people would get out of this mindset. The game doesn't require everyone to be in BiS gear, perfect spec, with a "perfect" raid composition.
---
Yes, that's pretty much daily business.
---
Yep.  When I finish my grind to 60, I'm going to find a good spot to camp and fish until my bags are packed each week.
---
And gl opening AQ gates with just one faction...
---
The 30s inspection CD is based on when you last inspected the target. Running through a group of 1000 allied units and hovering over them will still result in 1000 inspection requests.
---
Line 76 of honorspy.lua
---
How do I go about getting a UI like yours :D 
---
Super clean.
---
I really like enchanters who'll offer a fixed all-inclusive price. Especially for the cheapish stuff.
---
So much easier to just put your item in the trade window + fee and have it enchanted instead of hunting down the ingredients, carrying them around and then having to argue about the tip.
---
What's the alternative? Allow shitty add ons to ruin your game? Not an option.
---
&gt; the pvp gear is god tier right now so there's a very strong incentive for this toxic behavior
---
Nice to know that all the time I'm losing being farmed like a quest mob is going towards nigh-permanent horde dominance in the form of an ongoing gear advantage
---
Locks need an incoming heal weakaura, they should lose 10 dkp for each 1000 overheal they receive.
---
From what I remember, it was explained to me that GearScore compounded the problem by having to further communicate with each player in the location. Logging on with GearScore turned off wouldn’t lag out at all.
---
Well quests dungeons and boss fights actually work correctly
---
Not a blizzard fan boy but having played many private servers they are not even close to the real deal
---
The towns... So we define an mmo by a single hubs players can gather? Nothing more?
---
Hello there, I think I understand your question so I'll try my best to answer.
---
When you have one handed weapons equipped, Flametongue, generally, is the best bet. This is because they attack faster than 2H, and thus, you are applying the extra fire damage more often. Damage application and status application always works best on faster weapons because you end up doing more DPS than if you had the same buff on a slower weapon of the same DPS. 
---
Likewise, Rockbiter and Windfury are better on slower weapons. This is because attack power bonus from these enchants scales with attack speed. Slow weapons will do more damage than fast weapons if they have the same attack power bonus. So, when you hit someone with Windfury procs, you will do more bonus damage than you would with a fast weapon. 
---
I hope this helps. Good luck!
---
Edit: For PvP it depends on your target. Low armor cloth wearing targets you can use Windfury to great effect. You can deal massive damage to them with a single Windfury proc. On the other hand, well armored targets such as Warriors or Paladins will shrug off those big hits. You'll want to kite them around and avoid their high damage weapons attacks. Using Frostbrand Weapon can help you keep Warriors gimped with slows while you blast them with Flame and Frost shocks to bring them down. Don't forget to use your Earthbinding totem to keep them slowed as well. It's always best to deal magic or elemental damage to plate armor targets to avoid their damage mitigation.
---
Female Undead also have a sick backflip animation when they eviscerate. And IMO Female NE have a really cool bow shooting animation.
---
=
---
 I wonder what other races have interesting animations for specific things.
---
Is it really that bad for Horde on Firemaw?
---
I didn't realize queues were still a thing on anything other than the streamer server.
---
&gt;The point of faction transfers was to prevent the least dominant faction to leave though. I mean, the fact they left has worsened the expected balance and led to situation we have now.
---
My apologies, I misinterpreted the original post. I agree with you that faction transfers are trying to correct the issue the original ones created. That being said there is no incentive for the dominant faction to use them right now. They are just punishing the least dominant faction right now.
---
Was it an upgrade for him? If he was already geared is it possible it's the last piece he needed there and that was why he came?
---
Sure mr horde

The only way Blizzard even notices your feedback is if you unsubscribe.

---
Layer hopping like people did in p1 to get fresh mobs I think. Potentially the same guild could down all of the just by killing it and hooping over.
---
You'll get a renew which does roughly 970 heals without sp at max rank. 
---
Generally, this is enough 95% of the time since you shouldn't be pulling aggro and we're not going into a boss fight. I've also had zoomer groups where I'd go full OOM because mobs would run into other packs or tank suddenly doesn't have a shield/etc. If I don't have full mana then we wipe on some pulls due to some peoples inability.(sometimes my own)
---
It also costs healers money to drink unless they got a mage in the group. 
---
With 20% faction discount from rank 3 and being honored, it still costs 6.4 silver per honey dew water which doesn't fill an empty mana bar. (20+ are being used per dungeon)
---
Of course this is all circumstance but I agree that some healers are very unaware or don't care to top everyone off after every pull even when they're at near max mana. 
---
I also heal as a shadow priest sometimes but would still only drop a renew on you if you're over 50% and I need to drink.
---
Let's see... It doesn't cause lag on inferior private servers, but causes lag on the superior Blizzard servers?
---
Think you're reasoning is a bit wonky.
---
What about going through the loch modan tunnel and then through the cauldron? Brm entrance still sucks but gotta get in somehow either way.
---
Another one people often don't know:  
---
Enter DME through the back door in the pavilion north of camp mojache. You can skip most stuff in there if you want to do dme or even stealth through. Or you take off your gear, suicide, release. Then just ghost-run into the wing of DM you actually want to run. Works for both factions.
---
Alliance going to scholo can try the mountain path from aerie peak. If you go as a group you can even follow the river and go through the spider tunnel to strat.
---
Alliance often camp bulwark on our server so flying to tarred mill for scholo is good for horde as well.
---
&gt; the big alliance guilds are banding together leading counter raids to stop this crap from happening. 
---
You must be on a different Whitemane from me, cause I have never once seen alliance in control of anything.
---
Yea true. But as a rogue I don't really mind since most of the hordes don't even know how to play at all like this guy so it's just free honor farm
---
Why would GearScore lagg the game at all?
---
Dont tell a damn soul about this.  Advanced targeting dummies.  Look into it.

Rain of fire is like 1300mana almost and a good geared warlock has around 4.5k mana, also takes like 2 hits to cancel the channel and if the mobs arent dead by then u wont kill them, same with hellfire.. sure warlocks farm solo very well but they can not aoe farm at all. but a warrior just needs a shaman to make 50g/h each with jump runs. Wich is better than gold per hour than warlocks get in for example maraudon. So in the end warlocks have 1 better spot wich is dm east solo. Doesnt seem unfair to me.
---
Nothing.
---
Glad you like it :D Eh you can download dominos for the action bars, rest is just default UI with shadowed HUD
---
Look at the parties health and your healers mana bar in addition to your own, and you'll know when to tap.
---
Then just tap anyway like most warlocks. xD
---
You derailed me long ago. It's OK, I'm sure you can find someone who yells as vividly, to take the convo up with.
---
But no money in the budget, because of the lay offs they then had the money which they would have paid those 800 people to now hire more devs. J.Allen Brack said that they will be increasing the dev teams of WoW, Hearthstone, Overwatch and Diablo I think it was and were going to be focusing devs in certain areas which sounds like they're making it so they have more man power and don't have to rush things as much.
---
im confused. your selling fiery for 10g with your mats?
---
wow thanks
---
But they won't. They will just get back to camping you.
---
Prob more that there’s nothing they can do to stop it
---
I always played horde. Wanted to check out alliance as well, but I really really can't stand the models. It will be hard for me to finally try them out
---
You don't need them for that if you have competent players who are held accountable
---
Its not the PVP that's the problem, its the sheer amount of unbalance
---
It is,
---
Most level 60 tanks join a raiding guild and do dungeons only with guild members because they can't stand BS like this in pugs.
---
Mages with water do this shit all the time.
---
Tip them less then a gold and they try and give you one or two stacks.
---
So frustrating
---
The time it would take to form a group is never worth it when there's three times as many horde camping every endgame zone. Grouping up is just met with more raids flying in to farm honor off you.
---
The time bomb was epic. It put so much power into whoever held it. People who aren’t firing Dantonio. So it might be.
---
Server transfers would presumably be involved, and people would actually be motivated to do so.
---
Maybe, but how is the whispering happening?
---
OP deleted his post, but here is what he wrote;  
---
&gt; ITT: People who have no idea how HonorSpy works.
---
* It sends an inspect request a maximum of every 30 seconds, and it does not repeatedly request information about the same player.  
---
* It does not immediately share this information. It only broadcasts upon death, and a maximum of once per hour (server-wide) or once per 10 minutes (guild or raid). It only transmits 10 players at a time.  
---
* Calculating diminishing returns after each kill has nothing to do with the servers. What?? It stores a list of players you've killed locally and uses that to calculate diminishing returns.
---
* Most importantly: ADDON CHAT MESSAGES ARE THROTTLED. IF YOU EXCEED THESE LIMITATIONS, YOU WILL BE DISCONNECTED.
---
&gt; **Source: Someone who has contributed to HonorSpy.**  
---
As other people like /u/RandomSquirrels have pointed out though, the honorspy.lua directly contradicts what /u/IsleOfOne was saying.  
---
So either the people who "have contributed to HonorSpy" are lying, or they don't fully understand just how much their addon is fucking over the servers.
---
Get OPie. Put all non-combat essential spells on it (Greater Invis, stones creation, summons etc.).
---
Apart from that it's really your preference. I'd fit perfectly with all my binds without MMO mouse using not more than SHIFT and few ALT modifiers. And that's including all the downranked spells, PvP items and whatnot.
---
None of my friends nor myself have it installed and were all getting 2-5 minute chat lag on Arugal last night as well. But they were all in Melbourne, and myself playing in Sydney only got about a 5-seconds delay. I don't think having the addon makes the difference if you experience the lag or not. It ends up affecting people who don't have it as well.
---
But the location affecting the lag is something worth looking into.
---
its when u tag / dps their targets/kills so you get part of the honor from their kill without helping much (so he gets mad for getting less honor)
---
Hi, /u/potsos

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e4pgg8/addon_showing_time_remaining_on_buffsdebuffs/). 
---
For how long do skeletons from players stay on the ground?
---
I keep seeing people saying this, but it's not true. If/when you die, the GY placement is terrible. Then, when you die at BRM, you release to TP, meaning you have to run all the way through the mountain. I'm glad it worked out for you, but in general it's faster overall to just corpse hop through SG.
---
And he bans someone who’s been subbed for 15 months (which is 100s of $) for mentioning he seemed upset when he is clearly upset and going overboard). 
---
Clearly the person subbed for 15 months should’ve seen this coming, this dude is clearly unstable.
---
Might as well just have faerlina queue time on it
---
Wanted to play UD mage, friend wanted to play alliance. He bribed me with a hamburger meal.
---
I guess that's true, the only time our guild steps into BRM is for our weekly MC and ubrs runs. We always stick together and move to the mountain as a group from Redbridge. Our guild runs full 40 man raids so we never have problems, heck when we did ubrs, we had no issue 10v20ing xD Most horde we come across aren't really that geared either. 
---
It's really a toss up with the mountain, it comes in waves. We never go to searing gorge, always Redbridge or Morgans vigil as a group.
---
I normally only like to play with my friends, rarely alone so that may be my main pro
---
 I saw two mages doing it in the same day and had to ask the second one. From my perspective it looks like they had misunderstood the idea behind shatter and did it backwards.
---
I asked the dude in the politest way possible why he finished with the nova and all he could say is “shut up, I’m the one playing Mage” like that means he can’t be wrong.
---
I just found it really funny, mage is the new Huntard and all evidence supports it. I even get opened on as a Warrior (x2) by Frost Mages thinking i’m a free kill and then do something so stupid I cant lose - like blinking INTO me.
---
I’m not saying all Mages are bad but at this point it seems like most of the bads are Mages.
---
If they can ban people for sitting on a roof then they can stop people from colluding. The act itself is pretty noticeable.
---
Haha love it hopefully I get Leaf this week!
---
Well it's not like a single user could do it, the problem occurs if much people use this addon.
---
Okay, so he doesn't find the lack of reservation to be unfair, he would just like some more hunters to be a staple part of the guild - besides sounds like he has gotten plenty of "loot" from MC in general, so you can hardly say that the guild somehow "owes" him the reservation.
---
Good :) thats all the pvp they will get :) 1 more freaking weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek :D lets do this boiiiiiiiiiiiiiiz!!! 
---
Alliance instant queue vs Horde 2h+ queue :D
---
Pvp servers aren’t for everyone
---
Fun fact, one of the craziest combos in wow is Gnomish Mind Control cap -&gt; Dark Pact spam. It's ABSURDLY strong. At max rank Dark Pact drains 250 mana, and has a 1.5 second GCD. If your mind control cap lasts max duration that means at best you can get off 13 casts, totaling around 3250 mana drained.
---
I remember learning it from [what I consider the best 1v1 of all time](https://youtu.be/lbINgb673JM?t=517). When I first saw that combo I was like.... "holyyyyyyyyy shit". Barely anyone back then knew about it and I feel like even today it's highly uncommon to see it. 
---
Not to mention you can also bandage and cancel it to put the 'Recently Bandaged' debuff on them. So not only do you sap a huge chunk of their mana away, they also can't bandage themselves.
---
Finally people always think the best minion to use with Dark Pact is an imp. But if you're doing that, your imp will basically never get a chance to attack since it will be oom. A voidwalker is much better since you would care less if he has zero mana due to the fact that you're essentially keeping him out just for sacrifice.
---
It's a crappy situation all around and shows a lack in leadership. PUG members deserve access to loot since you wouldn't be able to do the raid without them. However, in the current set up it seems like random hunters are just using it as a way to get the leaf then run as none are coming back for a second week or attempting to join the guild. 
---
The situation gets even more sketchy when the raid lead will reserve gear for himself but no one else. Obviously hunters are important or he wouldn't be making sure to source multiple for each raid. Shouldn't the hunter be rewarded for being consistent? Plus, after the guild hunter gets it you can use it to entice hunters to PUG easier knowing they'll be guaranteed to get it on drop.  
---
If it was me, I'd ask for it to be reserved and leave if they aren't willing to do it. Giving out epic quest gear to PUG's ultimately isn't benefiting the guild. Sure, PUG'ing will acquire more drops than not running period but you're shitting on the morale of your guild just for the sake of running the raid. That won't last long. Guild will have an easier time convincing 1 hunter to PUG knowing they won't get the leaf than having to PUG 2 hunters due to running your one off.
---
Keep running Maraudon untill you have a chance to improve on gear. DME is doable with prebis, but some raid gear definitely helps on 3rd boss.
---
I think I was for part of it, but not all.
---
Can you link the source for this plan? I just checked out the Q3 earnings call transcript as someone else suggested, but I didn't see any mention of this.
---
From the honorspy.lua...
---
This game isn’t even good enough to get that mad over.
---
Yes. The honorspy.lua.  
---
Look at it yourself for how it works.
---
I thought if/then statements didn't work in wow macros????? Have I been lied to????
---
Yes, it's really entertaining to watch all the professional grunt players run around in raids. Can't wait when the wheels of fortune change and the sub becomes a river of tears from those grunts like you, crying about the BG queues demanding a change.  
---
Yo do know that, the larger group you are farming honor with, the less honor/hour you are getting my fellow grunt pal?
---
I switched to a Destruction heavy conflagration (5/11/35) build strictly for PvP and enjoy it much more than SM/DS Ruin.
---
There are bad players in every role.
---
If you're horde, you can/should farm open world resources. 
---
If you're alliance, stay out of the world and farm Maradon.
---
There were about 5 small radiant shards in AH last night going for 6g+ on my server.
---
Still pointless
---
No ruin or DS then
---
It's funny, everyone freaked the fuck out about there being that LFG addon early on before classic launched yet now people are OK with addons bordering on cheating.
---
Grobbulus is about 50/50 eheh
---
Every horde in this thread "iT wAs FoR tHE aESthEtIC"
---
&gt;Our guild runs full 40 man raids so we never have problems
---
I pugged a 40-man yesterday, we were surrounded by groups of five at all times that were constantly picking off people because it wasnt worth the time to turn the raid around.
---
&gt; it comes in waves. [...] rarely alone so that may be my main pro
---
People keep telling me this, but I have never seen it. Anytime I've seen alliance dominant, it's because they're en route to an instance or raid and the horde'll be back in about 5 minutes. I'm glad I'm 60 and can solo farm instances, because the open world is simply not an option any more.
---
That would break many other addons too, I guess.
---
If you are a student you can easily play all day. Many courses dont have mandatory attendance. I also have a couple of friends that can play at their job.
---
I prioritized spirit until level 45 or so when I looked up my class spec and realized spirit isn’t doing shit while in battle. 
---
Who needs spirit with dark pact anyway? Stamina and intellect all day.
---
i'll take that as a yes.
---
Do you remember how many people complained about the LFG addon the week or so before classic launched? And all the #nochanges crowds? And now people are calling for changes, or there's addons out there bordering on literal cheating that go un-killed. It's ironic, and funny.
---
There's a name plate addon that does this.. Think it's called NeatPlates
---
Edit: corrected addon name
---
Isn’t the only who is crying you?
---
Because you can only get honor from an individual 4 times per day.
---
If a rogue is killing someone and have the kill secured and someone comes and damages the target, they share a portion of that honor gained.
---
The rogue is mad that a kill he felt he had secured has now had its resources shared with another player.
---
Likewise
---
Should show their name tbh, they see it on reddit and stop the behaviour. Self regulating community
---
There's a little thing called fun, try it mate, that min/maxing is getting to you!
---
There's people doing 600+ dps in mc now, with few epics and that means theres room for any meme spec, regardless of what it is. Not a ton of room ofc, but no raid will hurt so much, from having a ret pally and a boomkin it in, they can't progress. With the bis knowledge we have and the 1.12 talents and balance changes, dps will not really ever become an issue in wow classic, if your guild distributes loot proberly. Including the meme specs.
---
As an example, our guilds first OEB dropped last night after 10 weeks of raiding. It went straight to the ret pally, no questions asked. This is classic, there's plenty of room for things like this.
---
I suggest going for a PvE realm if you do try this. Pyrewood Village is nice!
---
Well to be fair to them, in vanilla there was a website where you could check rankings week to week, there was far less of a need for an addon like this.
---
I have the addon, but I have not experienced any lag and all the sharing options are turned off, but I can't remember if that was by default or whether I did it manually.
---
Also, tell them when theyre going on reddit. Repprt the cunt for abuse too
---
Holy shit they wasted your Nana?
---
And the didn't have the same megaserver populations...
---
Which is causing other issues in classic too for a world not designed for that many people at once.
---
&gt; For now the goal is it to track the population numbers of the ***beta and stress test realms*** as accurate as possible.
---
I'd bet this guy hasn't updated his addon since Blizzard broke it (and others like it) back in September.
---
/console ffxdeath 0
---
Good idea but with one caveat. 
---
Players can exploit extra resources and dodge fights or whatnot from jumping from layer to layer. The solution is to have one one layer for level 60s and those who group with a level 60 and a 2nd layer everyone else. Now only those leveling can exploit and there are only a single extra layer to do so in.
---
The only time I'm going to BRM is in a raid, typically with another raid of my faction doing the same. Otherwise that place is taboo.
---
Why? Because the game has been out for 15 years, people have cleared it pre 60 wearing greens, and it's about time for the community to get creative with their raid attempts.  
---
Imagine a full raid of meme specs downing rag. fucking epic man.
---
Lol my first sentence above was addressing non-combat specifically. It doesn’t do much in battle but stam and int also don’t do shit in battle compared to spell power. Spirit shines as a leveling stat because of its aggregate benefit between combats. Good use of 5 second rule makes spirit better than int/stam for the leveling process as a whole, not just in combat. You downgraded by moving to int/stam. Also dark pact sucks ass in general anyway
---
Raidspot means fuck all if you aren't entittled to a share of the spoils. Otherwise, you are just filling in their numbers.
---
If I bid points on something and do not get the item, do I get those points back?
---
How is it any different to win trading in Arena? That was not allowed.
---
I'm pretty sure they automatically adjust between phases for drop rates, if any. And indicating how many runs wouldn't be a good idea. The drop rates give you all the information you need. I don't know why would would want to collect a second set of much more fallible data.
---
Nah, it would be terrible. Default UI has lots of room for improvement.
---
Saw this posted on our server's subreddit. The video's pretty funny but it's a good example of what's happening on Skeram - the horde have started freely killing people even in the center of Ironforge. I was killed while AFK at the mailbox, and I know multiple people who've been killed even inside the bank/AH.
---
People don't even try to travel to the other parts of the city alone if they are flagged. There's nowhere in the open world that's safe for us anymore. It's like some sort of zombie apocalypse...
---
Except they won't move on.
---
How am I being suspiciously defensive? I don't see how Honor Spy is griefing players.
---
The AQ gates are going to open within 24 hours on big servers. People are going to prefarm everything they can and with server discord’s it’s going to be even easier to organize that type of stuff across faction and guilds.
---
I'm 100% sure it is
---
Trinket Shamen aren't a joke. They can two shot medium ranked pvp players.
---
What server is this? Gg
---
Not epic IMO, it just takes longer to get the same result. I just want to log on, get my gear, log off ASAP.
---
It's not about clearing rag, you're gonna use talisman even past BWL and as a druid healer I would be very upset if key gear was sent to meme specs and a boss died at 1% in a progression raid because a boomkin and not a mage got talisman. MC is faceroll, I definitely agree with you there but where you ship the gear matters for future raids. Then again I'm in LC guild with friends so I don't have to worry about this. We already know who's due next for what piece of gear that drops because it's decided and published a couple days before the raid and if we have a problem with it we just discuss it with LC leads. 
---
I feel bad for people who have to do DKP
---
Don't forget about the tea bagging. Man i lost my last 7 days of game time trying to level up at STV. The worst part is that i can't buy more time, i just wanted to get level 40 and my mount so i could come back on christmas. At least i reached level 36.
---
Nah we have memespeccs who are fine with looting last. Anyway someone need loot last. They are already happy with the stuff nobody wants.
---
Understand that this matchup is basically mage trying their best to sit in your face, shatter off novas and skillfully mongo you with instant casts. The better you deny them from sitting on top of you the less chance they have because 3 of their main instants are not in range. If you know they will blink into you, you can even go for a cheeky nade on top of yourself. If they can't get into frost nova range, you win no question - just by dotting and running really.
---
Devour Magic frost novas, if they are in fear you can offensively devour sometimes (Fel doggo can also dispell the blanket silence from counterspell). Keep Spellstone ready, you can use it for a quick Shatter denial. 
---
Try baiting counterspell with searing pain spam. Otherwise, fake cast one fear, 95% will insta CS. Just dont hold cast for too long, batching can fuck you otherwise. 
---
Siphon Life and Corruption on mage at all times. Most won't dispell curses while trying to burst you down so add Curse of Agony to that. If for some reason they start actually casting things, Tongues + Searing Pain and pet pushback will make them not and likely lose. If they use shadow reflector, immediately Siphon Life. It's health neutral for you (actually a mana gain), will break CC and if you put shadow absorb up it's even minor healing for you. Death Coil when they are close (not hard, they want to be) so they don't have time to react and when they don't have Ice Barrier up so you receive healing.
---
As I said, most mages just go in and turbocleave spamming arcane explosion, rarely bothering to cast anything. Therefore, you can use your Fel doggo's spell lock offensively as blanket silence to secure Fear. Searing Pain a lot.
---
Due to how aggressive mages play, they don't even Frostbolt a lot so your Frost reflector may be unused. Fire reflector however will always get value, since they pretty much mash Fire Blast off cooldown.
---
This matchup often simply comes down to stat check. Prioritize self-healing. Generally if you are not under 50% hp after first 10-15 seconds you will win.
---
Oh and if you know they will WotF instantly, follow up with Death Coil. Coil is Terror so it ignores fear immunities so it will either make them Ice Block and spend two cds right away or give you enough time to wait out immunity.
---
Out of combat , sure. 
---
Any experienced warlock will almost never be out of combat while grinding. I will never choose spirit over int/stam. Learn to balance your pulls and mana usage and you will never be oom.
---
Yeah im at 4 hours a day abd its consumed me. Im basically no lifing it outside of my work.
---
&gt;  This is private server players changing the very fabric of the game.
---
Umm, it's Blizzard who decided to radically increase the server capacities, which on the surface makes sense because they have better hardware.  
---
You could argue that it was private servers that popularised mega-populations, but ND had US, EU and Chinese players so they weren't all logged in at the same time.
---
I mean, there is zero reason to Nova at the end of your rotation in regards to DPS. Maybe to keep them physically stuck but not really neccessary in a dungeon - more of a burden if its done randomly.
---
Any Frost Mage worth their salt is running R1 Frost Nova because anything else is a waste of mana - which brings me back to the question of why?
---
Lets be honest here - they were just bad mages. I guess anyones gonna look like garbage when they only understand the ‘what’ but not ‘why’ they do. Which is why I find it funny when someone is say - wearing half a BiS list yet missing Hit Cap. 
---
People just blindly follow cookie cutter guides with no clue.
---
But you have no proof that this one add-on is bringing down blizzards entire chat server. Right? Not saying it couldn't but correlation does not imply causation, unless you got some more in-depth details. I could see this affecting your local performance before denting blizzard servers.
---
Ahh, you meant target cast bars... well, those are gutted already. The API to get a target's current spell is gone in Classic, so this has to be guessed from the combat log. Just like back in the day!
---
As for the auction house.. it's a pain to use without any addons. Can't do anything about people creating lots of auctions quickly anyway ;)
---
What does this have to do with no changes though? Nothing was changed lol. You think discord caused this? Not at all. And ventrilo existed back then and I used it for this very purpose. In fact I met an alliance hunter on vent through one of my horde friends who would tell us where alliance were at and stuff so we could go kill them.
---
Seriously? The game can be played without pvp. No one made someone roll on a pvp server, it's their own fault if they don't like pvp
---
Okay well if you want to ignore the facts I can’t stop you.
---
The easiest question is why are you running this instance?
---
I've watched three of Kirm's videos today. Skeram seems like a living Hell. I can see why Allies would be quitting.
---
As someone who played in vanilla, just try and level via dungeons. STV is not, and never will be, worth it.
---
Your response is basically copypasta at this point.
---
I never said you couldn't treat people badly, just that you shouldn't.
---
What you do is ultimately on you.
---
Have you provided such facts?
---
I mean actually doing math.
---
its actually a legal software approved by blizzard I think is called isBoxer or something is like a macro kinda thing
---
More surprised by the fact there is a dungeon group looking for 3dps instead of a tank.
---
You have 50% crit on frozen enemies already
---
That Paladins couldn’t heal themselves (like the hero in WC3). I autoattacked for 12 levels (and died for a long time) before I realized my mistake.
---
Rofl wonderful.
---
I don't have it installed and get 5-10 sec chat lag.
---
Yup. OP needs to freeze trap that bitch.
---
It's what pro gamer Gnome mages say to prot paladins getting killed by 60s while leveling in stv
---
Do you have a priest? Because I also have a 60 priest and can run out of mana quickly in 58+ dungeons with 500 healing power so honestly no, you cannot efficiently heal.
---
Raids will never be as difficult as they were before as it's a 15 year old game in an iteration that people solved several times over. Do you honestly think people were pugging MC back in vanilla?
---
Youre the biggest loser ive encountered in a while! Congratulations
---
If gamers had integrity as a consumer block this guy would be unknown.
---
And since I know he's probably reading this, just so you know "Dwane", you're more of a hilarious pussy than my cat dressed as Bozo for Halloween.  I'd duel you IRL for funsies.
---
There is too much information out for WoW classic. I have maintained that this is “Classic” not “Vanilla” similar games but very verrryyy different. People simply know too much about the game. There’s nothing unsolved and there’s some theory crafters out there who say there’s stuff to be discovered but realistically the only thing to discover is how the net code works now and how to exploit it better than in vanilla . there’s a ton of bugs that weren’t present back then and there’s no longer bugs that were present back then, that’s about the only thing to really break down. Other than that everyone knows the optimized PvP spec, all the best gear and how to get it. Back in vanilla there wasn’t guilds with 4 raid teams all decked to the teeth full clearing MC in 1.5 hrs each 3 months into the game.
---
I’ve clearly explained elsewhere in this thread how warlocks only get marginally less Mp5 per point of spirit than priest/mage, it is still more net regen than int/stam/lifetap, more passive, and scales extremely well with improved drain soul, which is pretty much a necessary talent under level 50 or so.
---
Without knowing your motives, wouldn't using layer hopping be primarily used to avoid pvp? Isn't that the main reason to introduce it vs say increasing mob or node respawn rates?
---
I'm sure that would be considered a fair and fun mechanic by the playerbase.
---
&gt; The "gear up the tanks" (and healers, back in 2004-early 2005) mentality is a contributing factor of why it original took guilds so long to kill Ragnaros back in the day. Their DPS was so bad they had to deal with two Sons of Ragnaros phases.
---
Back then blue +spellpower gear was basically nonexistent, and I think +hit gear as well, and on most people's computers and connections MC was a slide show. I think that had a lot more to do with slow kill times than lack of understanding.
---
I use Quartz
---
I tried to farm SM but it was way too boring for me. Also, i like to complete all quests and i wanted to be done with STV so i never come back again. I did try to level up in other zones and dungeons, that's how i got to level 36. I was stuck at 33 in STV. After all, i still didn't reach 40.
---
:o
---
&gt; Granted I work a lot of overtime and have a wife and kid
---
Well that cuts most of your free time already. People who don't work overtime or maybe work part time / study and are single will literally have at least 5 times as much free time, so it's not weird that people have several lvl 60s if you even have managed to get to level 58.
---
Go for the bowstaff of disintegration  it will give you plus 7 mana
---
You drive a 1999 Toyota Corolla with 600,000 miles you 1 dollar pussy! What a fucking toolbag. 
---
 I remember when I was as cool as that guy.
---
It’s not even just that. Some recipes cost hundreds of gold to get. I don’t mind tossing 20g for a stats to chest enchant if I bring the mats.
---
Incendius, NA East
---
No? If I trade kills with a cooperating guild on the other faction, how am I making it harder on myself? The kills they are giving me only compete with my faction's standing, and vice versa.
---
The guild I was in back in Vanilla used this method.  While some people are saying bad things, if managed well, it works very good.  
---
Only advice I would give as trial member, be present online and tun dungeons with people to get to know them and help them get gear.  At this point, many are running alts, so even helping on alt runs is a good way to get known.
---
How is this any different then the shit show for quest items, at launch? Blizzard did nothing then, so nothing will happen now.
---
You are missing the point.   The game(retail) in it's current state is largely "flaw fixing" type of progression.    People that have a problem with the flaws as they existed back then need not play it and leave it to those who desired that original flawed game.    There is no perfection for everyone's interests.   But there is a historical state to return to.    If you don't want to or can't understand that I don't know what to tell you other than wait as the game progresses this timeline once again.  Because greed will make it so.

You'll find everything here
---
I'm just saying if you wipe just one extra unnecessary time because you sent gear to a meme spec then it would be unforgivable for me. You're free to play how you want and so am I. I have limited time to play so I just want to get gear and log off. Thankfully I play with like minded people. Game is not hard but why make it harder and take longer for no good reason?
---
Setup a freezing trap in front of you, pull with concussive shot and immediately start the tame. Basically, anything you can do to make it take longer for them to get to you.
---
Lmao this has 0 to do with no changes
---
Drain soul is a trap talent and really not very good, neither is spirit or int or stam tbh, shadow dmg is everything.
---
Really should be the other way around, whats tailoring giving back until you hit 60 / 300 anyway?
---
Oh well.
---
Focus target wasn’t implemented until WOTLK i believe. I’m really used to it also, but i reckon its not part of the “authentic” classic experience so i’ve avoided getting any addons to simulate it.
---
Yeah; I enjoy a good dust-up, but I'm also pretty used to doing a lot of solo play. As disc, I'm free honor unless I've got other people with me though; especially since every horde on the server seems to be UD.
---
Issue is, I can't reasonably go asking for the three or four people I'll need to escort me any time I want to solo farm DME, so I simply don't even bother.
---
&gt;It's easy for the Horde to do it because they literally have no risk (boats vs zepelins for example.)
---
The horde bias goes surprisingly deep once you start looking at it. Virtually every piece of content that both factions participate in offers a better experience to the horde.
---
The point is, literally, to protect the Honor system. Nobody cares if you collude with the other faction to allow you entrance into MC. Everyone cares if you collude with the other faction to allow you to get the top RP bracket.
---
Where? Where do I get these fights when there are less Alliance players around and most of those around have rank 15 City defender from sitting in SW/IF? Even here people whine about getting ganked when they are on their way to dungeons or questins aka they don't want to fight, so attacking them would be not fair according to you. What if I have better gear then them? It's not fair, right? That's not how this game works.
---
Lol that song might aswell be don't make me get my main.
---
To me it looks like shitty design / programming by the addon developper. 
---
Every other addon uses this special chat channel to communicate. That's how addons can tell you they're up to date (they see someone spamming a newer version in that chat).
---
No need to limit what addons can do just because one person doesn't know how to optimize something.
---
Except they arent. Brackets are already fixed and theres a deal between all top players that will push for rank 14
---
Explaining is not proving. I have no reason to believe you if you provide no hard evidence. 
---
Is spirit fantastic for leveling and keeping your regen up ? Sure. 
---
If you have decent gear while leveling, you can jump from mob to mob with never drinking regardless of which stat is higher. It’s about pulling correctly and not over casting your spells. 
---
Keeping a consistent rotation with how you pull and what spells you use with proper life tap usage, and you’ll never be oom.
---
And how do you know honorspy is whats causing the chat lag?
---
Just silly baseless assumptions, get some proof before you make inane claims
---
Thats the best part. I have a group of about 6 or 8 healers which i have grouped with.  Most of the time one of them will message me... hey wanna run X
---
Sure, i'll run with you because i know i wont end up with a repair bill more than the run is worth. If we get some nub ERRRMGAD MAH NUMBERS! dps, we suggest he stop eating paste, if he doesnt we kick him and get another dps
---
I never disagreed that spell power is the best stat.
---
Well you did level as Holy so.. (/s)
---
I’ve been having computer problems about a week and a half, and going through 4 days of this bullshit was enough, I’m not even mad I can’t play it was terrible.
---
i respect the insight.
---
Lot of times as a warrior where you want to hit to build up rage, but not use abilities because tank is still working on threat/you’re high on the threat table. Efficiency etc
---
With cannibalize
---
You make a great argument for private servers tbh.
---
We have our guild leader who's the main tank run jump runs with our holy healer friend alongside a rogue. They 3 man it, she gets the herbs, and the rogue warrior share the vein at the end. They take the back door to get in since DM E is a shit show!
---
Could have been the group too.
---
Was your whole group taking damage every pull? You'd be surprised how easy it is to heal a competent group over a shit one.
---
On my Druid I can do a dungeon with a proper tank and good DPS without drinking.
---
With a shit group I'm drinking every pull. Tank can't hold aggro because the DPS are going ham, forcing me to heal them and the tank.
---
Basically if the healer actually said "you can't hold aggro" there's probably 1 of 2 things wrong. The dps in the group was shit, or you're a bad tank. Or could have been a combination of both.
---
Basically DPS shouldn't be taking damage unless there's some AoE mob in the group. If DPS roles are taking damage vs mobs with no AoE, tell your DPS to smarten the fuck up and mark targets for them to focus.
---
Or maybe your healer was just a baddie :D
---
awful input.
---
I know, just realize that the alliance toon you are ganking may be a diehard wc2 fan as well.
---
Alliance players are brain dead
---
Ah, another turd bird “streamer” seemingly being childish, making outrageous claims. I think the hat you have on backwards is clearly too tight. 
---
“Reee omg I’m dead in the lower parts of the mountain, and 3-6 whole people from 2 guilds are  “colluding honor””
---
The things people will do these days for 1 follower, geese.
---
He also stream sniped Esfand playing his stream live while doing it lol I saw it and was like...really?
---
Are all horde there this bad ? I'm thinking of making an alt there
---
So basically you chimed in and offered the usual Horde delusion for no real reason and now you're confused as to why it looks like you're engaging in the usual Horde delusion. 
---
You might be the dense one, son.
---
Yeah, I possibly experienced that recently with what I felt like were maybe genuine huntards. There was an (IMO really dumb) argument when a quick strike ring dropped. The master looter gave priority to fury warriors. Like 5 - 10 minutes AFTER the decision was made, not even DURING the whole process of when it was being decided what goes to who, someone chimed in and was like "hey how come hunters didn't get to roll on that?" After a mostly pleasant and smooth raid this started a somewhat heated talk about BiS lists, in the sense that yes technically quick strike is there for hunters because of the generic attack power bonus and critical rating, but the looter made the IMO understandable ruling that the strength and to a lesser degree the stamina on the ring made it more suited for melee classes. As a hunter myself until I looked up the BiS nonsense *I didn't even consider rolling on the ring at all* because I felt like strength was a dump stat for the class given the zero agility on the ring. I was much more focused on stuff like the dire maul tarnished elven rings for the raw agility and hit. I suppose a case could be made for hunters specced partially into survival for surefooted to look into crit rings, but even then it seemed petty to me when raid armor exclusive to hunters still drops and it's not like they had NOTHING. I should also point out that I didn't hear any complaints from rogues despite them ALSO getting a bit more utility out of the ring compared to hunters.
---
Probably better than 7 days in stv.
---
Same.
---
Yea that's the thing cause yesterday I tried to fear a mage who was on second straight charm and he was immune to fear
---
See the great thing about people who say this, what will you do when there’s no one left to kill? Or the amount of people left to kill are in such low numbers it’s not even worth it?
---
BGs will help to a very *small* degree but Horde queue timers will be a hell of a lot longer so you’ll have to try and supplement it with wpvp while in queue. Which leads back to hardly anyone left to kill out there. 
---
It’s a sad state of affairs when the larger portion of the player base (horde) see nothing wrong with the fact that day by day they are driving people to straight up quit the game. Not change to above server cause who wants to after hitting 60 getting their epic mount maybe some of the harder to obtain epics. They’d just quit and most people think that’s ok. All the way to the point that there’s no one left to fight then the Horde will start bitching about a problem they created.
---
If you changed it to "HEALS?", that might rustle a few jimmies
---
I’d rather them just completely ignore me and my health then to heal me and bitch and moan about it.
---
2k on faerlina lol
---
That's some next level mental gymnastics you went to there.
---
Will twink item prices go up or down on BG release? 
---
I feel that alot of people have been stockpileing?
---
I’ve done it on around 6 characters, never taken more than around 10 kills on that one
---
no one is complaining that "horde/alliance", its always the minority faction complaining, usually meaning horde is doing the camping. Its a simple numbers game. for every 1 alliance member, there are at least 2, sometimes 3 horde members. theres nothing that can be done to consistently fix that. "lol just get a raid group" is such a bad response.
---
&gt;If I do, can I still effectively single-target quest with an AoE farming spec for when I am able to AoE farm?
---
Yup, AoE spec basically just needs a few points in Imp Blizzard/FN to work well. 
---
Generally speaking though, mages can 1v1 anything that can be CC'd and doesn't have range or crazy abilities. 
---
&gt;Additionally, should I instead roll hunter?
---
If you want way easier raid loot and a cool pet, sure.
---
Right now in my guild it's pretty common for 5-7 mages to compete over one piece of gear, meanwhile we're actively looking for hunters to give the Petrified Leaf to.
---
You seem pretty clueless. On a PvP server there are either contested zones or uncontested zones, you can’t get “farmed” in the latter unless you’ve gone and flagged yourself.   
---
Uncontested zones for Alliance are:     Elwynn Forest, Dun Morogh, Teldrassil, Westfall, Loch Modan, Darkshore.    
---
Uncontested zones for Horde are:    
---
Durotar, Mulgore, Tirisfall Glades, The Barrens, Silverpine Forest.  
---
If you’re getting killed in Ratchet or the Crossroads like you’re saying, then you’ve flagged yourself for PvP so that’s completely on you..
---
This guy is correct, I did it with 2 chars. If you didn't do most darnassus quest while leveling (more rep per quest) you'll need something between 400-700 stacks.
---
Its not that bad now but jesus christ zoning into MC and just hearing one of our resident locks just spamming that shit.
---
Dude gets gangbanged by heals though.
---
But holy hell i still remember doing the stairs in ZF and this warlock was alternating between life tap and that AOE that drains their life and he died halfway through and holy fuck it took so much longer than it needed to because god damn he couldn't just decide on one thing nooo, gotta fuck my mana pool as hard as humanly possible.
---
My guild has unfunny lame people in it too.
---
I second the atiesh thing, there are still plenty of people leveling.
---
That's not how Blizzard bans people, at least not for these types of offences.
---
They usually get purged in a larger sweep. 
---
But yeah, sure, get mad bud. Whatever makes you feel better. ;)
---
Storyline nuggets such as?
---
&gt;It's clear that the horde are actually playing the PvP game and dominating while the alliance are simply honor farming.
---
What if I told you the PvP game in classic WoW is honor farming. Skill based pvp didn't come around until BC. Until then it's ganking and premades avoiding other premades.
---
Either I'm not to fussed
---
horde has every advantage you can imagine (within the game), so I guess it makes sense.
---
I healed BRD the other day with a lock that cannibalized or bandaged after most pulls. I was in shock. It was like seeing a unicorn, or your teacher in public.
---
Im sorry if your geared and lvl 60 and have invested alot of time. But the server is dead. Just leave it.
---
He's asking where you are getting the info that HonorSpy alone is causing the chat lag isuses. Your post is saying HonorSpy alone is doing this, that's what he would like some kind of source on.
---
My server has no chat lag issues and we have plenty of people who use HonorSpy + it's one of the more populated EU servers.
---
Again, just quote your /played here. If it's above 9 days, you could have very easily been 60 if you actually cared about getting there.
---
Druids are really bugged. I feel like viper sting has worked on me in feral forms though? Haven’t actually sat and tested it but I’d like to see video proving otherwise since I haven’t played in like a month, got geared af for feral tanking and did a few MCs and that’s about it for me. But I know Druid cat form bleeds go through on things they shouldn’t. Elementals are immune to bleed attacks but Druid cat form will apply bleeds to them and to Stoneskin Dwarves.
---
Just because alliance are quitting doesn't mean these particular statistics aren't misleading. I'm sure if you think about this for even half a second you can understand it too.
---
[Here's a quick graph I ~~drew~~ found](https://i.imgur.com/Z19VQtO.png) that shows alliance players over time. It matches your idea of reality, so that means it can't be a lie, right?
---
Lmao, he's bitching about "not keeping up with people" when all he's doing is fuck around instead of trying to actually get to the end game. 
---
If he doesn't have that as his focus, that's absolutely fine, but don't come bitching about others playing the game differently.
---
Replying to loot council remark
---
The problem is that it would only work with healers. The other one makes everyone not paying attention feels bad for a second.
---
Laughed way too had at this
---
Exactly
---
And with less than 30 players.
---
Nothing in Classic is hardcore, least of all bleeding-edge progression worthy. Only the mechanics of one boss in all of Classic could potentially claim the moniker of "hardcore": Viscidus. Naxxramas is hard, but nothing overgearing can't solve. Viscidus is hard even in t3 quality gear.
---
I'm a healer that's made a few tank budies. I have to type this once in lfg, pick 3 of of the responses and tell the rest sorry that were full. 
---
 You don't see these messages often because the group is usually filled within a minute or so.
---
Got mine for 80 when there were two others up for 150. I’ve seen it up for anywhere from 40-300 but assuming nobody will be paying that much at this point.
---
How is the economy?  Since I would be starting without a main to support for bags, etc.
---
We just run 10v10 scrims vs our friendly ally guild and farm more honor faster than the people who gangbang hapless alliance... The Alliance we play with are on top of the leaderboards too. BGs are gonna be so sweet!
---
Clear the area.  Drop a freezing trap.  Pull with scare beast.  After you scare beast, start the tame.  When scare beast wears off, the mob will run to you and land in your freezing trap.
---
Wow your clueless...o yeah, typical millennial 
---
Nvm
---
And ah prices will get even worse
---
I only just found out that you don't get double XP for quests if you're rested. Gutted, tbh.
---
Or hear me out probably should have rolled on a pve server. Like we all knew this would happen they game has been out for 15 years and this happened a lot on private servers. Also again we all know alliance is usually on the minority. Again I have no issue with all of this and I play alliance on Sekrem, and I say to my fellow allies either group up or accept that you will be ganked and killed a lot it is Warcraft lol.
---
They are.
---
Good.   Streamers and their groupies moving on is a big win for the community overall.
---
and the music started off so good :/
---
Only because alliance are playing grab ass in the trams and won’t go outside.
---
ya i never raided or anything but from my experience just leveling or doing world quests i can literally just endlessly pull and as long as I get one quick kill i'll have victory rush available off cooldown. All the shit retail gets tho tbh that shit is actually a ton of fun, just more like diablo 2 than it is classic / vanilla
---
Did we watch the same video? A warlock seduction soul fired him, a mage engi helm pyroblasted him, he shadow reflected death coils, feign deathed a polymorph, dodged a grenade. What more do you want?
---
In our guild it is 2 weeks of raiding. So 2x MC runs before we decide whether or not we want you.
---
ye 100% need honor spy for any ranking, but wasnt chat lag before, so it isnt honor spy
---
Collusion?  
---
Any loot system can be corrupt if multiple people work together.
---
&gt;"using addons is CHEATING!!!!"
---
You do realize that these "cheating" addons are nowhere near as powerful as addons that existed in actual vanilla, yes?
---
Literally all they do is parse text from the combat log. That's not "cheating".
---
2-3 weeks is the norm. It's unfortunately kinda impossible to tell if your guild is abusing you to leech loot until that is. If you have raided with a guild for a month and haven't gotten any loot(if it has dropped at least), then you are def. getting fucked. But at that point the fucking is kinda done already. So yeah.
---
honorspy was there before the server start lagging tho. but its part of the problem, as blizzard lowered the combatlog to 50 yards more addons require chat logs to work. damage meter, boss mods, incoming heals and raid frames.. what they need to do is go back to 200 yards, and remove spy or ban it straight out
---
Combat dagger is super good for rogues and easier to gear.
---
Rogues should not get priority on swords over fury warriors, but they should absolutely get prio on daggers.
---
Should every perd blade get DE'd cause 'swords are better for rogues'? No, every decent rogue you will see is now using perd blade for pve and pvp. You genuinely have no idea wtf you are talking about.
---
I always see these posts about ganking at burning steppes FP, and I'm always left wondering one thing.
---
Who even goes to burning steppes?
---
I played Alliance in Vanilla. Also played Horde in WotLK when factions didn't mean anything. 
---
Friend made me roll Horde in Classic, and I feel dirty and shameful everyday. It just feels wrong
---
There will be enough people for battlegrounds and pve content.
---
It's not against TOS. Devilsaur Maria is 100% legal. Wintrading and stuff in BGs might attract a ban but I doubt they do something about this unfortunately
---
Well, only if you're rushing to level up. I'm new to WoW in general and i like to take my time to read and explore.
---
Managed to get mine today at around 130ish kills.
---
The reasoning being that they prefer when quests work? Okay.
---
I could tell just from this twitter video lmao, this just proved it.
---
Down
---
As someone who also played in vanilla, if you do not *specifically* love world PvP, meaning you enjoy needing to dodge deathballs and always having to worry about being ganked? **Roll PvE.** All the "but but the *full experience*!" people are full of crap. World PvP is great fun if you have the time to really dedicate to the game, get really nice gear to actually be able to compete, and really *love* that aspect of the game.
---
Questing and leveling 1-60 (and doing stuff out in the world after that) is a lot of fun as well, but those aren't thing a casual player will ever get to do on a PvP server. You will be a glorified NPC to those who are more organised and with better gear.
---
This isn't me shitting on PvP servers.. I personally really enjoy them. But I hated seeing everyone claim that PvE was "half the game" and convince so many people they would be missing out if they rolled PvE when the reality is for *many* people PvE is the better choice and will offer a much, much fuller and enjoyable experience. Those poor bastards are now being camped to death until they reroll or quit. It's not fun, it's not a full experience, it's the *denial* of experience so that someone else can have a good time.
---
What's worse is that most of the people I've seen publiclly claiming that PvP is the only way to play leveled as fast as possible, mostly in dungeons, to avoid PvP. Then they geared up as quickly as possible to have a major advantage, and now they're out in big groups for even more of one. For them.. yeah PvP is great. For people who play differently that is really not the case.
---
It was just like that, I played at launch on one of the top PvP servers.   That is why on classic I choose to go to a PvE server because I knew it was going to be an unbalanced mess.
---
Big assumption thinking that other DPS are paying attention to party frames lol
---
sounds like payback to me
---
Well you can't really blame blizzard for the balmac issue. More people like rolling horde you know?
---
I love WoW videos with music like this. I always find some neat new band c:
---
A GM came down and hovered over the inn in Hillsbrad to tell the horde on Skeram to stop roof camping, but it didn't do much. They safespot every chance they get - now in Ironforge in the mystic ward. What can you do?
---
I said bordering on cheating. I never called any addon straight up cheating.
---
honorSpy addon?
---
Oh right, we could totally fight a boss while the healer ran out of mana on rats. Gotcha. I’ll be sure to take your opinion into consideration, never.
---
Are you really saying people don't funnel their MT when tank threat determines how much the dps can pump lol?? The quality of your mitigation pieces determines how much TPS gear you can wear. You always gear MT first.
---
All addons communicate via chat channels, how do you think dps and threat meters work? They sync their data.
---
Hey if you're good with development, I've been playing with this idea and you are free to have it. What if we had an add-on where you rated people you pugged with (could even have categories like politeness, player skill, etc) so you could see who's worth pugging with and who's just wasting your time?
---
I won’t heal a Lock if I don’t see him at least attempt to bandage or eat once.
---
yea, im not giving you 6 stacks of water for 30s. im not asking for 6g for 6 stacks but be reasonable.
---
Think I got it at 30. Arena was empty when chest spawned so I yoinked it.
---
Yes, it was if you played on any of the launch PvP servers which were just as overcrowded as these were, the added servers were not as bad because they were not overcrowded, but the launch servers were really bad.  I literally only could log onto my alts to level them late at night because of how many times you would get ganked meant progression during primetime was impossible.    I played on a PvP server at launch which is exactly why I choose to do a PvE server for this because I remember how shit the experience was, especially once they added honor to the game.
---
fiery is around 20g on my server 0.o is it that cheap on yours?
---
Tank as either Arms or Prot. Fury is not great for tanking 5 mans.
---
**As Prot:** 
---
1. Equip 1h + shield. 
---
2. Berserker rage before pull
---
3. Battle stance + charge macro 
---
4. Defensive stance + shield slam macro 
---
5. Demo shout 
---
6. Switch targets and do one sunder on everything while using shield slam / revenge on CD
---
7. Spend extra rage on Cleave
---
**As Arms:** 
---
1. Equip 2h. 
---
2. Tell people to chill with DPS until after first whirlwind. 
---
3. Berserker rage before pull
---
4. Battle stance + charge macro 
---
5. Rage pot if you don't have 30 rage
---
6. Sweeping strikes 
---
7. Berserker stance + whirlwind macro 
---
8. Defensive stance 
---
9. Demo shout 
---
10. Sunder on all targets, use whirlwind macro / revenge on CD 
---
11. Spend extra rage on Cleave
---
12. Battle stance and pool rage for next pack when the mobs are close to dying so you don't have to rage pot.
---
Where the fuck do I say that? I say, kill spider boss FIRST and skip the gate part totally.
---
Can you not read?
---
600 dps with "few epics?"
---
Are these people playing Warrior and just so happen to have Viskag and Brut Blade/CHT and Edgemaster's as their "few epics" and are fully loaded to bare with every possible consumable buff they can get? Because hot damn, most people are NOT doing that much in mostly blue gear.
---
I scored a 97th percentile at 508 dps as a mage on Rag 2 weeks ago, and I already have 6 epics with every enchant I can get. No way 600 dps is common with "few epics" on any other fight that isn't a turret tank n spank boss.
---
Even if it's true, it is Blizzard who *allowed* an addon to lag their game. Don't blame an addon for Blizzard's fault.
---
By literally reading the lua code on the addon and seeing that it's making a shitload of queries per second.
---
No one really knows.
---
There's a lot of speculation because when Vanilla came out no one ever 'saved up' twink items, you'd either use them or sell them on the AH for a few gold as you leveled since there was no real interest in it prior to BG's.
---
Nowadays I've seen screenshots of peoples banks filled with twink items, enchants and other consumables perfect for low brackets so I imagine that the supply is significantly higher than it was in vanilla when BG's initially came out. 
---
I think that twink items will still be worth quite a lot (relative to their actual level), but I figure that when BG's come out and people start making twinks more consistently, you'll see a lot of the people that stockpiled them start to release them to the AH so that they may not be as crazy prices as some people expect. 
---
We'll just have to wait and see though, who knows how many people have actually bothered leveling twinks and kitting them out at this point.
---
That streamer tho, who even watches that crap?
---
You'll never find a horde alone on firemaw but this dude really tops the leaderboard of bad players i've seen seen so far
---
Assuming you're going to gear as dps you can do what I did.
---
Upon reaching 60 I stayed as arms in my leveling spec for quite some time until I got gear for fury. So, I recommend learning BRD and tanking it for the Savage Gladiator Chain and HoJ. The 2h axe from Emperor is also a good pick up until you get your Dal'Rends. You will also get a chest piece from 7 dwarves until the Savage Gladiator Chain drops. 
---
While I was spamming BRD I was also doing LBRS and especially UBRS (as dps, arms is great for dungeons) whenever possible, all these dungeons are close to eachother. I did this to pick up True Strike Shoulders, Dal'Rends, Valor Shoulders and the bracers. You only need to do Jed/Rend runs for this. Last boss also drops a good shield and a ring I recommend.
---
If you don't want to tank and you can scan world chat from time to time and look for people who need dps for strat live/ud aswell for Mask of the Unforgiven and Cape of the Black Baron.
---
Upon getting enough hit and both dalrends, I switched to fury.
---
I saved all my money for Lionheart helmet but wether you buy that or 100% mount is up to you. I recommend buying the Devilsaur Set first though. Gl and hf.
---
Yeah I've heard people get 24hr - 48hr bands for cross faction communication, one guy was raging here last week and missing the point he kept saying blizz were weak because whatever he said was not even abusive but the ban is just cross faction chat in general.
---
But also see a lot of people who don't get banned likely because not many people would bother reporting someone for saying "i am georgio armani" after killing them.
---
I think the exact opposite ... worst offenders are human males
---
If we cannot kill rats, and the healer runs out of mana quick on small pulls,  then even if we teleported straight to a boss and fought them, how exactly would we win a harder fight that lasts longer...?
---
I’m just not even interested in spending time replying or reading your comments, move along.
---
It is. If you run Adblock and leave the site up for an hour, there’ll be like 4000 ads blocked
---
Frost while leveling
---
I second this. Dwarves are why i play Alliance, IF is the coolest thing sense ice, and its a MMO i want to be hero not a villain....plus i hate goth kids (rich spoiled brats that complain how horrible their life is while they spend $100 bucks at rite aide so they can look pale)...goth kids play horde fyi
---
I can understand falling for well crafted phishing attempts. Everyone is only human and some of these things look so lifelike you really need to sit down for a minute to spot the differences - easy to miss in a hurry or with life going on in the background.
---
Falling for a guy named Blizzards telling you to visit usa-warcraft is peak Darwinism and probably doing your future group- and guildmates a favor.
---
Classic aura
---
that was only when he was between the FP and the outside of BRM. It wouldn't matter if he stealthed the whole way to the entrance as there was 90 fucking horde in there dude. He clearly also wanted to gank the rogue who makes so many peoples lives miserable.
---
If you play 100+ hours a week, you’re absolutely a no-life loser.
---
Honorspy is bordering on cheating? or just spy?
---
PvE racials? Access to EK?

I really want to roll conflag for some fun pvp since Ive found that most of the end game activities in classic wow to be actually fairly boring. I have 3 T1 fel pieces and about 200 SP. I want to get advice on if I should really wait to get more gear before this is a good idea or not. Will I just get stomped if I try now? I’m also playing with ~250 ms ping (but I can’t choose another server now so oh well). 
---
Getting new gear in end game is actually incredibly time consuming between finding groups to run things, farm things, and traveling. I’m a lock which makes it a bit faster with summoning, but I find that it’s nearly impossible for it to be like “I have 2 hrs right now lemme take a dice roll on X dungeon boss for Y gear upgrade”. It doesn’t seem to be possible to do much of anything towards actual gear upgrades in a play session under 2 (even 3) hrs, outside of raiding (which has weekly lockouts). 
---
This more or less turned into a bit of a rant. I guess I’m just having less fun with the way the game works at end game grind, but I’m still very addicted to the game and can’t bring myself to quit since I haven’t reached my goal of having fun pvping (at least at a marginally decent level).
---
To me, the final end game goal of classic wow is pvp with the sick gear you’ve spent months grinding/leveling for. I don’t need to be the absolute best I just wanna enjoy the fruits of my labor to satiate my wow goals I’ve had since my mom made me quit vanilla wow back in 2005 at age 11 forcing me to part ways with that lvl 32 warlock.

Most threat-meters aren't auto-inspecting *everyone* you see and then sharing that data with *everyone* using the addon on your entire server.
---
You have the option not to get ganked a million times and you dont take it because you want to read the text of boring fetch quests.
---
I'm genuinely curious and not trying to be a dick...but why are you flagged in your own city?
---
As an Alliance-Stalagg player, this video made me jealous. I wish it was half this easy to get to BRD on my server.
---
pretty sure mine was in the first few mobs
---
perhaps repayment for some of the terrible drop rates ive had elsewhere
---
The big Alliance guilds on those servers should organize now to hold AQ hostage
---
Maybe you just take too much damage. And you jumped straight into rat parts without doing any bosses? Okido, nice lie.
---
Shit, I'd get one if it was guarunteed to last 600k miles
---
You really think twink item values will crash when BG's relesae? i would of thought it'd increase?
---
Thos is why I've been saying killing someone 20 or 30 levels below you should be a dhk
---
spy need to get BAN, but do not touch the combatlog anymore. they did the 50 yards, now you got so many addons sending info over chat channels it breaks the chat server.   
---
i would say set it back to 200, ban spy somehow, limit the ability for addons to send message over hidden channels.
---
Hmm, I get shit for being fury prot. "What do you mean you're not full prot for 5 mans? How are you going to hold any aggro?!"
---
Lol need to toughen up buttercup. Its pvp game find guildies who wanna enjoy the slaughter, again coming from a hardcore ally on Sekrem. No changes I love how my server is!!
---
I even still see 1980's model Camrys still running, 30 years later.
---
?
---
The horde are just dis proportioned humans too though?
---
Lmao this will be such a shitshow. Imagine people griefing this 24/7 doing whatever they can to prevent other guilds from getting the tag to increase their odds on "world first BWL"
---
&gt;  as an addon that allows you to play with your brain turned off
---
The addon can't control your character. The addon can't make you do the mechanics properly. Literally all it does it show ability timers for the boss. That is not "playing with your brain turned off".
---
Yall always whining about this, yet on Incendius it feels like this for horde.
---
People wanted#Nochanges and the OG classic feel. Isn’t this it?
---
Well, he must be making the rounds. I got a whisper from him on Arcanite Reaper.
---
Hi mate,
---
I've been doing duo runs with my mage friend.
---
You can almost duo anything. We've done DM:T, DM:N, DM:E, strat living , lbrs , ubrs (up to first boss but you can go further if you get help summoning the boss) and parts of Strat UD.
---
You can also go farm sinews and eye of shadow, but those are quite rng. Living for orbs or east for herbs/mining is better gph.
---
A small price to pay for salvation
---
Sorry but, we had multiple layers; each with a healthy vanilla population. Let’s say 2.5k is vanilla. And let’s say 4 layers for examples sake. That’s 10k people on the server at one time. With large queue times.
---
Then they drop to one single layer. So 10k people on one layer? Or they keep it at only 2.5k across the server? Which would mean HUGE queue times? Or it’s somewhere in between?
---
What do you think is more likely?
---
What does it feel like to you?
---
Because everyone seems to feel like there is far more people than before.
---
male orc rogue combat animations are horrible
---
tell me what the point is of stamina and int while leveling? with maximum efficiency you are never full hp or mana as a lock anyway. the only stats that matter is spirit and shadow damage
---
Shit exp compared to SM though and people are on their 2nd or 3rd toon by now. I think it gets an appropriate amount of love
---
Every damn time. I'll wait to bandage, I'll bandage immediately, I'll bandage during the fight. No matter what, I always get a heal immediately after I start bandaging.
---
Well, that is on you, that is how Warlocks function and they get way more mana back life tapping than it costs you to heal them. Hellfire is one of the best AOE spells in the game as long as he doesn't have aggro or the talent to reduce pushback with a Paladin's Conc Aura.  
---
If you're going to heal in Classic, just remember the Warlocks aren't doing this to fuck you. If you're a Priest a single Renew kept rolling on them is more than enough to sustain them.
---
I’m on a horde on a horde dominated server and we have ally rogue squad in undercity, every zepelin, most graveyard and in front of orgri. They kill straggler while most people just ignore them, building a group to kill them is a waste of time, you kill a few and they scatter and you can’t tracK them. So you just wait to be out of pvp when going through the less populated area, and watch pvp tagged people get murder and rage after you not doing anything (I’m not charging into 5+ rogue)
---
Just rogue things, they have a uinteractive mechanic so they can pretty much do whatever they want
---
For me personally I like to use void when I (used to ) grind mobs in the open world. It not great at holding aggro but it holds it just a little bit longer than the succubus. 
---
In dungeons I use my imp for Stam boost for the group. He does decent damage as well. 
---
Lvl53 alt lock
---
I never had it, and still servers goes down for me
---
I play a rogue and this just made me sick to my stomach lol.
---
99 percent of warlocks are good with tap. The others usually die alot
---
What? No... Tell me more.
---
Imagine crying and insulting people because of a game. You must've gotten real far in life if this gets you so riled up.
---
Thanks for your honor mate.
---
And these TOS cannot be enforced. Nobody can force me to kill someone out in winterspring if I don't feel like it. If I don't want to kill people from a certain guild in the opposing faction, that's my right. If I want to kill a certain guild, race or class on sight that is also my right regardless of them being lvl 11 and worth zero honor. Trying to moderate these interactions is exactly the sort of thing that will lead to BFA-level community and game design.
---
For PvE I had a priest who was mind soothing his ass off one time. We were blowing through LBRS skipping a ton of packs and only pulling parts of other packs. Didn’t realize how strong mind soothe was before, knew it was good but not THAT good in terms of time management. Once you’re 60 doing gear runs mind soothe can be invaluable in speeding up a run. 
---
For PvP there’s a few things. Druids using abolish poison or shamans use poison cleanse totems is extremely powerful vs rogues. Blind = poison so it’s removable + the poisons are poisons ofc. For some reason I rarely see both these classes use those abilities to counter rogues
---
Why is there a 13 columns (from 1000 to 13000) of ranking points per week ? 
---
Shouldn't it be 14 ?
---
He has no honor.
